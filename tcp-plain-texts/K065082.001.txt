 portrait of Edward Gibbon  EDWARD GIBBON Esq  r  born the  th  May  Engraved by Joâ–ª Hall from an Original Picture Painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds  THE HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE By EDWARD GIBBON  Esq  VOLUME THE FIRST A NEW EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR W STRAHAN AND T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXIII  PREFACE  IT is not my intention to detain the reader by expatiating on the variety or the importance of the subject which I have undertaken to treat since the merit of the choice would serve to render the weakness of the execution still more apparent and still less excusable But as I have presumed to lay before the Public a  first  volume only  The first volume of the quarto is now contained in the two first volumes of this octavo edition  of the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire it will perhaps be expected that I should explain in a few words the nature and limits of my general plan  The memorable series of revolutions which in the course of about thirteen centuries gradually undermined and at length destroyed the solid fabric of Roman greatness may with some propriety be divided into the three following periods  The first of these periods may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines when the Roman monarchy having attained its full strength and maturity began to verge towards its decline and will extend to the subversion of the Western Empire by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia the rude ancestors of the most polished nations of modern Europe This extraordinary revolution which subjected Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror was completed about the beginning of the sixth century  II The second period of the Decline and Fall of Rome may be supposed to commence with the reign of Justinian who by his laws as well as by his victories restored a transient splendour to the Eastern Empire It will comprehend the invasion of Italy by the Lombards the conquest of the Asiatic and African provinces by the Arabs who embraced the religion of Mahomet the revolt of the Roman people against the feeble princes of Constantinople and the elevation of Charlemagne who in the year eight hundred established the second or German Empire of the west  III The last and longest of these periods includes about six centuries and a half from  the revival of the Western Empire till the taking of Constantinople by the Turks and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes who continued to assume the titles of Caesar and Augustus after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a single city in which the language as well as manners of the ancient Romans had been long since forgotten The writer who should undertake to relate the events of this period would find himself obliged to enter into the general history of the Crusades as far as they contributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire and he would scarcely be able to restrain his curiosity from making some inquiry into the state of the city of Rome during the darkness and confusion of the middle ages  As I have ventured perhaps too hastily to commit to the press a work which in every sense of the word deserves the epithet of imperfect I consider myself as contracting an engagement to finish most probably in a second volume  The Author as it frequently happens took an inadequate measure of his growing work The remainder of the first period has filled  two  volumes in quarto the  four  last volumes of this octavo edition  the first of these memorable periods and to deliver to the Public the complete history of the Decline and Fall of  Rome from the age of the Antonines to the subversion of the Western Empire With regard to the subsequent periods though I may entertain some hopes I dare not presume to give any assurances The execution of the extensive plan which I have described would connect the ancient and modern history of the World but it would require many years of health of leisure and of perseverance  BENTINCKSTREET  February  P S  The entire History which is now published of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in the West abundantly discharges my engagements with the Public Perhaps their favourable opinion may encourage me to prosecute a work which however laborious it may seem is the most agreeable occupation of my leisure hours  BENTINCKSTREET  March  An Author easily persuades himself that the public opinion is still favourable to his labours  and I have now embraced the serious resolution of proceeding to the last period of my original design and of the Roman Empire the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in the year one thousand four hundred and fiftythree The most patient Reader who computes that three ponderous volumes  The six volumes of this octavo edition  have been already employed on the events of four centuries may perhaps be alarmed at the long prospect of nine hundred years But it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the Byzantine history At our entrance into this period the reign of Justinian and the conquests of the Mahometans will deserve and detain our attention and the last age of Constantinople the Crusades and the Turks is connected with the revolutions of Modern Europe From the seventh to the eleventh century the obscure interval will be supplied by a concise narrative of such facts as may still appear either interesting or important  BENTINCKSTREET  March  The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is now delivered to the Public in a more convenient form Some alterations and improvements had presented themselves to my mind but I was unwilling to injure or offend the purchasers of the preceding editions The accuracy of the Corrector of the press has been already tried and approved and perhaps I may stand excused if amidst the avocations of a busy winter I have preferred the pleasures of composition and study to the minute diligence of revising a former publication  BENTINCKSTREET  April  ADVERTISEMENT  DILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an historical writer may ascribe to himself if any merit indeed can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty I may therefore be allowed to say that I have carefully examined all the original materials that could illustrate the subject which I had undertaken to treat Should I ever complete the extensive design which has been sketched out in the Preface I might perhaps conclude it with a critical account of the authors consulted during the progress of the whole work and however such an attempt might incur the censure of ostentation I am persuaded that it would be susceptible of entertainment as well as information  At present I shall content myself with a single observation The Biographers who under the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine composed or rather compiled the lives of the Emperors from Hadrian to the sons of Carus are usually mentioned under the names of Aelius Spartianus Julius Capitolinus Aelius Lampridius Vulcatius Gallicanus Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus But there is so much perplexity in the titles  of the MSS and so many disputes have arisen among the critics see Fabricius Biblioth Latin l iii c concerning their number their names and their respective property that for the most part I have quoted them without distinction under the general and wellknown

the Empire in the Age of the Antonines  IN the second century of the Christian Aera the empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth and the most civilized  Introduction  portion of mankind The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government During a happy period of more than  A D  fourscore years the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva Trajan Hadrian and the two Antonines It is the design of this and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous condition of their empire and afterwards from the death of Marcus Antoninus to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of the earth  The principal conquests of the Romans were  Moderation of Augustus  atchieved under the republic and the emperors for the most part were satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the policy of the senate the active emulation of the consuls and the martial enthusiasm of the people The seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs but it was reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth and to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils Inclined to peace by his temper and situation it was easy for him to discover that Rome in her present exalted situation had much l  ss to hope than to fear from the chance of arms and that in the prosecution of remote wars the undertaking became every day more difficult the event more doubtful and the possession more precarious and less beneficial The experience of Augustus added weight to these salutary reflections and effectually convinced him that by the prudent vigour of his counsels it  would be easy to secure every concession which the safety or the dignity of Rome might require from the most formidable Barbarians Instead of exposing his person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians he obtained by an honourable treaty the restitution of the standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of Crassus  Dion Cassius l liv p with the annotations of Reymar who has collected all that Roman vanity has left upon the subject The marble of Ancyra on which Augustus recorded his own exploits asserts that  he compelled  the Parthians to restore the ensigns of Crassus    His generals in the early part of his reign attempted the reduction of Aethiopia and Arabia Felix They marched near a thousand miles to the south of the tropic but the heat of the climate soon repelled the invaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions  Strabo l xvi p Pliny the elder Hist Natur l vi c and Dion Cassius l liii p and l liv p have left us very curious details concerning these wars The Romans made themselves masters of Mariaba or Merab a city of Arabia Felix well known to the Orientals see Abulfeda and the Nubian geography p They were arrived within three days journey of the Spice country the rich object of their invasion  The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the expence and labour of conquest The forests and morasses of Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians who despised life when it was separated from freedom and though on the first attack they seemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power they soon by a signal act of despair regained their independence and reminded Augustus of the vicissitude of fortune  By the slaughter of Varus and his three legions See the first book of the Annals of Tacitus Sueton in August c and Velleius Paterculus l ii c c Augustus did not receive the melancholy news with all the temper and firmness that might have been expected from his character    On the death of that emperor his testament was publicly read in the senate He bequeathed as a valuable legacy to his successors the advice of confining the empire within those limits which Nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries on the west the Atlantic ocean the Rhine and Danube on the north the Euphrates on the east and towards the south the sandy desarts of Arabia and Africa  Tacit Annal l ii Dion Cassius l lvi p and the speech of Augustus himself in Julian's Caesars It receives great light from the learned notes of his French translator M Spanheim    Happily for the repose of mankind the moderate  Imitated by his successors  system recommended by the wisdom of Augustus was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure or in the exercise of tyranny the first Caesars seldom shewed themselves to the armies or to the provinces nor were they disposed to suffer that those triumphs which  their  indolence neglected should be usurped by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants The military fame of a subject was considered as an insolent invasion of the Imperial prerogative and it became the duty as well as interest of every Roman general to guard the frontiers intrusted to his care without aspiring to conquests which  might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished barbarians  Germanicus Suetonius Paulinus and Agricola were checked and recalled in the course of their victories Corbulo was put to death Military merit as it is admirably expressed by Tacitus was in the strictest sense of the word  imperatoria virtus    The only accession which the Roman empire  Conquest of Britain was the first exception to it  received during the first century of the Christian Aera was the province of Britain In this single instance the successors of Caesar and Augustus were persuaded to follow the example of the former rather than the precept of the latter The proximity of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed to invite their arms the pleasing though doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice  Caesar himself conceals that ignoble motive but it is mentioned by Suetonius c The British pearls proved however of little value on account of their dark and livid colour Tacitus observes with reason in Agricola c that it was an inherent defect  Ego facilius crediderim naturam margaritis deesse quam nobis avaritiam  and as Britain was viewed in the light of a distinct and insulated world the conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system of continental measures After a war of about forty years undertaken by the most stupid  Claudius Nero and Domitian A hope is expressed by Pomponius Mela l iii c he wrote under Claudius that by the success of the Roman arms the island and its savage inhabitants would soon be better known It is amusing enough to peruse such passages in the midst of London  maintained by the most dissolute and terminated by the most timid of all the emperors the far greater part of the island submitted to  the Roman yoke  See the admirable abridgment given by Tacitus in the life of Agricola and copiously though perhaps not completely illustrated by our own antiquarians Camden and Horsley  The various tribes of Britons possessed valour without conduct and the love of freedom without the spirit of union They took up arms with savage fierceness they laid them down or turned them against each other with wild inconstancy and while they fought singly they were successively subdued Neither the fortitude of Caractacus nor the despair of Boadicea nor the fanaticism of the Druids could avert the slavery of their country or resist the steady progress of the Imperial generals who maintained the national glory when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or the most vicious of mankind At the very time when Domitian confined to his palace felt the terrors which he inspired his legions under the command of the virtuous Agricola defeated the collected force of the Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills and his fleets venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation displayed the Roman arms round every part of the island The conquest of Britain was considered as already atchieved and it was the design of Agricola to complete and ensure his success by the easy reduction of Ireland for which in his opinion one legion and a few auxiliaries were sufficient  The Irish writers jealous of their national honour are extremely provoked on this occasion both with Tacitus and with Agricola  The western isle might be improved into a valuable possession and the Britons would  wear their chains with the less reluctance if the prospect and example of freedom was on every side removed from before their eyes  But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal from the government of Britain and for ever disappointed this rational though extensive scheme of conquest Before his departure the prudent general had provided for security as well as for dominion He had observed that the island is almost divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs or as they are now called the Friths of Scotland Across the narrow interval of about forty miles he had drawn a line of military stations which was afterwards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius by a turf rampart erected on foundations of stone  See Horsley's Britannia Romana l i c  This wall of Antoninus at a small distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow was fixed as the limit of the Roman province The native Caledonians preserved in the northern extremity of the island their wild independence for which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valour Their incursions were frequently repelled and chastised but their country was never subdued  The poet Buchanan celebrates with elegance and spirit see his Sylvae v the unviolated independence of his native country But if the single testimony of Richard of Cirencester was sufficient to create a Roman province of Vespasiana to the north of the wall that independence would be reduced within very narrow limits  The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with contempt from  gloomy hills assailed by the winter tempest from lakes concealed in a blue mist and from cold and lonely heaths over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians  See Appian in Proaem and the uniform imagery of Ossian's Poems which according to every hypothesis were composed by a native Caledonian    Such was the state of the Roman frontiers and  Conquest of Dacia the second exception  such the maxims of Imperial policy from the death of Augustus to the accession of Trajan That virtuous and active prince had received the education of a soldier and possessed the talents of a general  See Pliny's Panegyric which seems founded on facts  The peaceful system of his predecessors was interrupted by scenes of war and conquest and the legions after a long interval beheld a military emperor at their head The first exploits of Trajan were against the Dacians the most warlike of men who dwelt beyond the Danube and who during the reign of Domitian had insulted with impunity the Majesty of Rome  Dion Cassius l lxvii  To the strength and fierceness of barbarians they added a contempt for life which was derived from a warm persuasion of the immortality and transmigration of the soul  Herodotus l iv c Julian in the Caesars with Spanheim's observations  Decebalus the Dacian King approved himself a rival not unworthy of Trajan nor did he despair of his own and the public fortune till by the confession of his enemies he had exhausted every resource both of valour and policy  Plin Epist viii  This  memorable war with a very short suspension of hostilities lasted five years and as the emperor could exert without controul the whole force of the state it was terminated by an absolute submission of the barbarians  Dion Cassius l lxviii p Julian in Caesaribus Eutropius viii Aurelius Victor in Epitome  The new province of Dacia which formed a second exception to the precept of Augustus was about thirteen hundred miles in circumference Its natural boundaries were the Niester the Teyss or Tibiscus the Lower Danube and the Euxine Sea The vestiges of a military road may still be traced from the banks of the Danube to the neighbourhood of Bender a place famous in modern history and the actual frontier of the Turkish and Russian empires  See a Memoir of M d'Anville on the Province of Dacia in the Academie des Inscriptions tom xxviii p    Trajan was ambitious of fame and as long as  Conquests of Trajan in the east  mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of the most exalted characters The praises of Alexander transmitted by a succession of poets and historians had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan Like him the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east but he lamented with a sigh that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Philip  Trajan's sentiments are represented in a very just and lively manner in the Caesars of Julian  Yet the success of Trajan however transient  was rapid and specious The degenerate Parthians broken by intestine discord fled before his arms He descended the river Tigris in triumph from the mountains of Armenia to the Persian gulph He enjoyed the honour of being the first as he was the last of the Roman generals who ever navigated that remote sea His fleets ravaged the coasts of Arabia and Trajan vainly flattered himself that he was approaching towards the confines of India  Eutropius and Sextus Rufus have endeavoured to perpetuate the illusion See a very sensible dissertation of M Freret in the Academie des Inscriptions tom xxi p  Every day the astonished senate received the intelligence of new names and new nations that acknowledged his sway They were informed that the kings of Bosphorus Colchos Iberia Albania Osrhoene and even the Parthian monarch himself had accepted their diadems from the hands of the emperor that the independent tribes of the Median and Carduchian hills had implored his protection and that the rich countries of Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria were reduced into the state of provinces  Dion Cassius l lxviii and the Abbreviators  But the death of Trajan soon clouded the splendid prospect and it was justly to be dreaded that so many distant nations would throw off the unaccustomed yoke when they were no longer restrained by the powerful hand which had imposed it  It was an ancient tradition that when the Capitol  Resigned by his successor Adrian  was founded by one of the Roman kings the god Terminus who presided over boundaries  and was represented according to the fashion of that age by a large stone alone among all the inferior deities refused to yield his place to Jupiter himself A favourable inference was drawn from his obstinacy which was interpreted by the augurs as a sure presage that the boundaries of the Roman power would never recede  Ovid Fast l ii ver See Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus under the reign of Tarquin  During many ages the prediction as it is usual contributed to its own accomplishment But though Terminus had resisted the majesty of Jupiter he submitted to the authority of the emperor Hadrian  St Augustin is highly delighted with the proof of the weakness of Terminus and the vanity of the Augurs See De Civitate Dei iv  The resignation of all the eastern conquests of Trajan was the first measure of his reign He restored to the Parthians the election of an independent Sovereign withdrew the Roman garrisons from the provinces of Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria and in compliance with the precept of Augustus once more established the Euphrates as the frontier of the empire  See the Augustan History p Jerome's Chronicle and all the Epitomisers It is somewhat surprising that this memorable event should be omitted by Dion or rather by Xiphilin  Censure which arraigns the public actions and the private motives of princes has ascribed to envy a conduct which might be attributed to the prudence and moderation of Hadrian The various character of that emperor capable by turns of the meanest and the most generous sentiments may afford some colour to  the suspicion It was however scarcely in his power to place the superiority of his predecessor in a more conspicuous light than by thus confessing himself unequal to the task of defending the conquests of Trajan  The martial and ambitious spirit of Trajan  Contrast of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius  formed a very singular contrast with the moderation of his successor The restless activity of Hadrian was not less remarkable when compared with the gentle repose of Antoninus Pius The life of the former was almost a perpetual journey and as he possessed the various talents of the soldier the statesman and the scholar he gratified his curiosity in the discharge of his duty Careless of the difference of seasons and of climates he marched on foot and bareheaded over the snows of Caledonia and the sultry plains of the Upper Egypt nor was there a province of the empire which in the course of his reign was not honoured with the presence of the monarch  Dion l lxix p Hist August p If all our historians were lost medals inscriptions and other monuments would be sufficient to record the travels of Hadrian  But the tranquil life of Antoninus Pius was spent in the bosom of Italy and during the twentythree years that he directed the public administration the longest journies of that amiable prince extended no farther than from his palace in Rome to the retirement of his Lanuvian Villa  See the Augustan History and the Epitomes    Notwithstanding this difference in their personal  Pacific system of Hadrian and the two Antonines  conduct the general system of Augustus  was equally adopted and uniformly pursued by Hadrian and by the two Antonines They persisted in the design of maintaining the dignity of the empire without attempting to enlarge its limits By every honourable expedient they invited the friendship of the barbarians and endeavoured to convince mankind that the Roman power raised above the temptation of conquest was actuated only by the love of order and justice During a long period of fortythree years their virtuous labours were crowned with success and if we except a few slight hostilities that served to exercise the legions of the frontier the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the fair prospect of universal peace  We must however remember that in the time of Hadrian a rebellion of the Jews raged with religious fury though only in a single province Pausanias l viii c mentions two necessary and successful wars conducted by the generals of Pius st Against the wandering Moors who were driven into the solitudes of Atlas d Against the Brigantes of Britain who had invaded the Roman province Both these wars with several other hostilities are mentioned in the Augustan History p  The Roman name was revered among the most remote nations of the earth The fiercest barbarians frequently submitted their differences to the arbitration of the emperor and we are informed by a cotemporary historian that he had seen ambassadors who were refused the honour which they came to solicit of being admitted into the rank of subjects  Appian of Alexandria in the preface to his History of the Roman wars    The terror of the Roman arms added weight  Defensive wars of Marcus Antoninus  and dignity to the moderation of the emperors  They preserved peace by a constant preparation for war and while justice regulated their conduct they announced to the nations on their confines that they were as little disposed to endure as to offer an injury The military strength which it had been sufficient for Hadrian and the elder Antoninus to display was exerted against the Parthians and the Germans by the emperor Marcus The hostilities of the barbarians provoked the resentment of that philosophic monarch and in the prosecution of a just defence Marcus and his generals obtained many signal victories both on the Euphrates and on the Danube  Dion l lxxi Hist August in Marco The Parthian victories gave birth to a crowd of contemptible historians whose memory has been rescued from oblivion and exposed to ridicule in a very lively piece of criticism of Lucian  The military establishment of the Roman empire which thus assured either its tranquillity or success will now become the proper and important object of our attention  In the purer ages of the commonwealth the  Military establishment of the Roman emperors  use of arms was reserved for those ranks of citizens who had a country to love a property to defend and some share in enacting those laws which it was their interest as well as duty to maintain But in proportion as the public freedom was lost in extent of conquest war was gradually improved into an art and degraded into a trade  The poorest rank of soldiers possessed above forty pounds sterling Dionys Halicarn iv a very high qualification at a time when money was so scarce that an ounce of silver was equivalent to seventy pound weight of brass The populace excluded by the ancient constitution were indiscriminately admitted by Marius See Sallust de Bell Jugurth c  The legions themselves even at the  time when they were recruited in the most distant provinces were supposed to consist of Roman citizens That distinction was generally considered either as a legal qualification or as a proper recompence for the soldier but a more serious regard was paid to the essential merit of age strength and military stature  Caesar formed his legion Alauda of Gauls and strangers but it was during the licence of civil war and after the victory he gave them the freedom of the city for their reward  In all levies a just preference was given to the climates of the North over those of the South the race of men born to the exercise of arms was sought for in the country rather than in cities and it was very reasonably presumed that the hardy occupations of smiths carpenters and huntsmen would supply more vigour and resolution than the sedentary trades which are employed in the service of luxury  See Vegetius de Re Militari l i c  After every qualification of property had been laid aside the armies of the Roman emperors were still commanded for the most part by officers of a liberal birth and education but the common soldiers like the mercenary troops of modern Europe were drawn from the meanest and very frequently from the most profligate of mankind  That public virtue which among the ancients  Discipline  was denominated patriotism is derived from a strong sense of our own interest in the preservation and prosperity of the free government of  which we are members Such a sentiment which had rendered the legions of the republic almost invincible could make but a very feeble impression on the mercenary servants of a despotic prince and it became necessary to supply that defect by other motives of a different but not less forcible nature honour and religion The peasant or mechanic imbibed the useful prejudice that he was advanced to the more dignified profession of arms in which his rank and reputation would depend on his own valour and that although the prowess of a private soldier must often escape the notice of fame his own behaviour might sometimes confer glory or disgrace on the company the legion or even the army to whose honours he was associated On his first entrance into the service an oath was administered to him with every circumstance of solemnity He promised never to desert his standard to submit his own will to the commands of his leaders and to sacrifice his life for the safety of the emperor and the empire  The oath of service and fidelity to the emperor was annually renewed by the troops on the first of January  The attachment of the Roman troops to their standards was inspired by the united influence of religion and of honour The golden eagle which glittered in the front of the legion was the object of their fondest devotion nor was it esteemed less impious than it was ignominious to abandon that sacred ensign in the hour of danger  Tacitus calls the Roman Eagles Bellorum Deos They were placed in a chapel in the camp and with the other deities received the religious worship of the troops  These motives which derived their  strength from the imagination were enforced by fears and hopes of a more substantial kind Regular pay occasional donatives and a stated recompence after the appointed time of service alleviated the hardships of the military life  See Gronovius de Pecunia vetere l iii p c The emperor Domitian raised the annual stipend of the legionaries to twelve pieces of gold which in his time was equivalent to about ten of our guineas This pay somewhat higher than our own had been and was afterwards gradually increased according to the progress of wealth and military government After twenty years service the veteran received three thousand denarii about one hundred pounds sterling or a proportionable allowance of land The pay and advantages of the guards were in general about double those of the legions  whilst on the other hand it was impossible for cowardice or disobedience to escape the severest punishment The centurions were authorized to chastise with blows the generals had a right to punish with death and it was an inflexible maxim of Roman discipline that a good soldier should dread his officers far more than the enemy From such laudable arts did the valour of the Imperial troops receive a degree of firmness and docility unattainable by the impetuous and irregular passions of barbarians  And yet so sensible were the Romans of the  Exercises  imperfection of valour without skill and practice that in their language the name of an army was borrowed from the word which signified exercise  Exercitus ab exercitando  Varro de LinguÃ¢ LatinÃ¢ l iv Cicero in Tusculan l ii There is room for a very interesting work which should lay open the connexion between the languages and manners of nations  Military exercises were the important  and unremitted object of their discipline The recruits and young soldiers were constantly trained both in the morning and in the evening nor was age or knowledge allowed to excuse the veterans from the daily repetition of what they had completely learnt Large sheds were erected in the winterquarters of the troops that their useful labours might not receive any interruption from the most tempestuous weather and it was carefully observed that the arms destined to this imitation of war should be of double the weight which was required in real action  Vegetius l ii and the rest of his first book  It is not the purpose of this work to enter into any minute description of the Roman exercises We shall only remark that they comprehended whatever could add strength to the body activity to the limbs or grace to the motions The soldiers were diligently instructed to march to run to leap to swim to carry heavy burdens to handle every species of arms that was used either for offence or for defence either in distant engagement or in a closer onset to form a variety of evolutions and to move to the sound of flutes in the Pyrrhic or martial dance  The Pyrrhic Dance is extremely well illustrated by M le Beau in the Academic des Inscriptions tom xxxv p c That learned academician in a series of memoirs has collected all the passages of the ancients that relate to the Roman legion  In the midst of peace the Roman troops familiarised themselves with the practice of war and it is prettily remarked by an ancient historian who had fought against them that the effusion of blood was the  only circumstance which distinguished a field of battle from a field of exercise  Joseph de Bell Judaico l iii c We are indebted to this Jew for some very curious details of Roman discipline  It was the policy of the ablest generals and even of the emperors themselves to encourage these military studies by their presence and example and we are informed that Hadrian as well as Trajan frequently condescended to instruct the unexperienced soldiers to reward the diligent and sometimes to dispute with them the prize of superior strength or dexterity  Plin Panegyr c Life of Hadrian in the Augustan History  Under the reigns of those princes the science of tactics was cultivated with success and as long as the empire retained any vigour their military instructions were respected as the most perfect model of Roman discipline  Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced  The legions under the emperors  into the service many alterations and improvements The legions as they are described by Polybius  See an admirable digression on the Roman discipline in the sixth book of his history  in the time of the Punic wars differed very materially from those which atchieved the victories of Caesar or defended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines The constitution of the Imperial legion may be described in a few words  Vegetius de Re Militari l ii c c Considerable part of his very perplexed abridgment was taken from the regulations of Trajan and Hadrian and the legion as he describes it cannot suit any other age of the Roman empire  The heavyarmed infantry  which composed its principal strength  Vegetius de Re Militari l ii c In the purer age of Caesar and Cicero the word  miles  was almost confined to the infantry Under the lower empire and in the times of chivalry it was appropriated almost as exclusively to the men at arms who fought on horseback  was divided into ten cohorts and fiftyfive companies under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions The first cohort which always claimed the post of honour and the custody of the eagle was formed of eleven hundred and five soldiers the most approved for valour and fidelity The remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five hundred and fiftyfive and the whole body of legionary infantry amounted to six thousand one hundred men Their arms were uniform and admirably  Arms  adapted to the nature of their service an open helmet with a lofty crest a breastplate or coat of mail greaves on their legs and an ample buckler on their left arm The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure four feet in length and two and an half in breadth framed of a light wood covered with a bull's hide and strongly guarded with plates of brass Besides a lighter spear the legionary soldier grasped in his right hand the formidable  pilum  a ponderous javelin whose utmost length was about six feet and which was terminated by a massy triangular point of steel of eighteen inches  In the time of Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus l v c the steel point of the  pilum  seems to have been much longer In the time of Vegetius it was reduced to a foot or even nine inches I have chosen a medium  This instrument was indeed much inferior to our modern firearms  since it was exhausted by a single discharge at the distance of only ten or twelve paces Yet when it was launched by a firm and skilful hand there was not any cavalry that durst venture within its reach nor any shield or corslet that could sustain the impetuosity of its weight As soon as the Roman had darted his  pilum  he drew his sword and rushed forwards to close with the enemy His sword was a short welltempered Spanish blade that carried a double edge and was alike suited to the purpose of striking or of pushing but the soldier was always instructed to prefer the latter use of his weapon as his own body remained less exposed whilst he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his adversary  For the legionary arms see Lipsius de MilitiÃ¢ RomanÃ¢ l iii c  The legion was usually drawn up eight deep and the regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well as ranks  See the beautiful comparison of Virgil Georgic ii v  A body of troops habituated to preserve this open order in a long front and a rapid charge found themselves prepared to execute every disposition which the circumstances of war or the skill of their leader might suggest The soldier possessed a free space for his arms and motions and sufficient intervals were allowed through which seasonable reinforcements might be introduced to the relief of the exhausted combatants  M Guichard Memoires Militaires tom i c and Nouveaux Memoires tom i p has treated the subject like a scholar and an officer  The tactics of the Greeks and Macedonians  were formed on very different principles The strength of the phalanx depended on sixteen ranks of long pikes wedged together in the closest array  See Arrian's Tactics With the true partiality of a Greek Arrian rather chose to describe the phalanx of which he had read than the legions which he had commanded  But it was soon discovered by reflection as well as by the event that the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend with the activity of the legion  Polyb l xvii    The cavalry without which the force of the  Cavalry  legion would have remained imperfect was divided into ten troops or squadrons the first as the companion of the first cohort consisted of an hundred and thirtytwo men whilst each of the other nine amounted only to sixtysix The entire establishment formed a regiment if we may use the modern expression of seven hundred and twentysix horse naturally connected with its respective legion but occasionally separated to act in the line and to compose a part of the wings of the army  Veget de Re Militari l ii c His positive testimony which might be supported by circumstantial evidence ought surely to silence those critics who refuse the Imperial legion its proper body of cavalry  The cavalry of the emperors was no longer composed like that of the ancient republic of the noblest youths of Rome and Italy who by performing their military service on horseback prepared themselves for the offices of senator and consul and solicited by deeds of valour the future suffrages of their countrymen  See Livy almost throughout particularly xlii  Since the alteration of manners  and government the most wealthy of the equestrian order were engaged in the administration of justice and of the revenue  Plin Hist Natur xxxiii The true sense of that very curious passage was first discovered and illustrated by M de Beaufort Republique Romaine l ii c  and whenever they embraced the profession of arms they were immediately intrusted with a troop of horse or a cohort of foot  As in the instance of Horace and Agricola This appears to have been a defect in the Roman discipline which Hadrian endeavoured to remedy by ascertaining the legal age of a tribune  Trajan and Hadrian formed their cavalry from the same provinces and the same class of their subjects which recruited the ranks of the legion The horses were bred for the most part in Spain or Cappadocia The Roman troopers despised the complete armour with which the cavalry of the East was encumbered  Their  more useful arms consisted in a helmet an oblong shield light boots and a coat of mail A javelin and a long broad sword were their principal weapons of offence The use of lances and of iron maces they seem to have borrowed from the barbarians  See Arrian's Tactics    The safety and honour of the empire was principally  Auxiliaries  intrusted to the legions but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every useful instrument of war Considerable levies were regularly made among the provincials who had not yet deserved the honourable distinction of Romans Many dependant princes and communities dispersed round the frontiers were permitted for a while to hold their freedom and security by the  tenure of military service  Such in particular was the state of the Batavians Tacit Germania c  Even select troops of hostile barbarians were frequently compelled or persuaded to consume their dangerous valour in remote climates and for the benefit of the state  Marcus Antoninus obliged the vanquished Quadi and Marcomanni to supply him with a large body of troops which he immediately sent into Britain Dion Cassius l lxxi  All these were included under the general name of auxiliaries and howsoever they might vary according to the difference of times and circumstances their numbers were seldom much inferior to those of the legions themselves  Tacit Annal iv Those who fix a regular proportion of as many foot and twice as many horse confound the auxiliaries of the emperors with the Italian allies of the republic  Among the auxiliaries the bravest and most faithful bands were placed under the command of praefects and centurions and severely trained in the arts of Roman discipline but the far greater part retained those arms to which the nature of their country or their early habits of life more peculiarly adapted them By this institution each legion to whom a certain proportion of auxiliaries was allotted contained within itself every species of lighter troops and of missile weapons and was capable of encountering every nation with the advantages of its respective arms and discipline  Vegetius ii Arrian in his order of march and battle against the Alani  Nor was the legion  Artillery  destitute of what in modern language would be styled a train of artillery It consisted in ten military engines of the largest and fiftyfive of  a smaller size but all of which either in an oblique or horizontal manner discharged stones and darts with irresistible violence  The subject of the ancient machines is treated with great knowledge and ingenuity by the Chevalier Folard Polybe tom ii p He prefers them in many respects to our modern cannon and mortars We may observe that the use of them in the field gradually became more prevalent in proportion as personal valour and military skill declined with the Roman empire When men were no longer found their place was supplied by machines See Vegetius ii Arrian    The camp of a Roman legion presented the  Encampment  appearance of a fortified city  Vegetius finishes his second book and the description of the legion with the following emphatic words  Universa quae in quoque belli genere necessaria esse creduntur secum legio debet ubique portare ut in quovis loco fixerit castra armatam faciat civitatem  As soon as the space was marked out the pioneers carefully levelled the ground and removed every impediment that might interrupt its perfect regularity Its form was an exact quadrangle and we may calculate that a square of about seven hundred yards was sufficient for the encampment of twenty thousand Romans though a similar number of our own troops would expose to the enemy a front of more than treble that extent In the midst of the camp the praetorium or general's quarters rose above the others the cavalry the infantry and the auxiliaries occupied their respective stations the streets were broad and perfectly straight and a vacant space of two hundred feet was left on all sides between the tents and the rampart The rampart itself was usually twelve feet high armed with a line of strong and  intricate palisades and defended by a ditch of twelve feet in depth as well as in breadth This important labour was performed by the hands of the legionaries themselves to whom the use of the spade and the pickaxe was no less familiar than that of the sword or  pilum  Active valour may often be the present of nature but such patient diligence can be the fruit only of habit and discipline  For the Roman Castremetation see Polybius l vi with Lipsius de Militia Romana Joseph de Bell Jud l iii c Vegetius i iii and Memoires de Guichard tom i c    Whenever the trumpet gave the signal of departure  March  the camp was almost instantly broke up and the troops fell into their ranks without delay or confusion Besides their arms which the legionaries scarcely considered as an encumbrance they were laden with their kitchen furniture the instruments of fortification and the provision of many days  Cicero in Tusculan ii Joseph de Bell Jud l iii Frontinus iv  Under this weight which would oppress the delicacy of a modern soldier they were trained by a regular step to advance in about six hours near twenty miles  Vegetius i See Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxv p  On the appearance of an enemy they threw aside their baggage and by easy and rapid evolutions converted the column of march into an order of battle  See those evolutions admirably well explained by M Guichard Nouveaux Memoires tom i p  The slingers and archers skirmished in the front the auxiliaries formed the first line and were seconded or sustained by the strength of the  legions the cavalry covered the flanks and the military engines were placed in the rear  Such were the arts of war by which the Roman  Number and disposition of the legions  emperors defended their extensive conquests and preserved a military spirit at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and despotism If in the consideration of their armies we pass from their discipline to their numbers we shall not find it easy to define them with any tolerable accuracy We may compute however that the legion which was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and thirtyone Romans might with its attendant auxiliaries amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men The peace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades and most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and seventyfive thousand men Instead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities which the Romans considered as the refuge of weakness or pusillanimity the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers and along the frontiers of the barbarians As their stations for the most part remained fixed and permanent we may venture to describe the distribution of the troops Three legions were sufficient for Britain The principal strength lay upon the Rhine and Danube and consisted of sixteen legions in the following proportions two in the Lower and three in the Upper Germany one in Rhaetia one in Noricum four in Pannonia three in Maesia and two in Dacia The defence of the Euphrates was  entrusted to eight legions six of whom were planted in Syria and the other two in Cappadocia With regard to Egypt Africa and Spain as they were far removed from any important scene of war a single legion maintained the domestic tranquillity of each of those great provinces Even Italy was not left destitute of a military force Above twenty thousand chosen soldiers distinguished by the titles of City Cohorts and Praetorian Guards watched over the safety of the monarch and the capital As the authors of almost every revolution that distracted the empire the Praetorians will very soon and very loudly demand our attention but in their arms and institutions we cannot find any circumstance which discriminated them from the legions unless it were a more splendid appearance and a less rigid discipline  Tacitus Annal iv has given us a state of the legions under Tiberius and Dion Cassius l lv p under Alexander Severus I have endeavoured to fix on the proper medium between these two periods See likewise Lipsius de Magnitudine RomanÃ¢ l i c    The navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to their greatness but it was  Navy  fully sufficient for every useful purpose of government The ambition of the Romans was confined to the land nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the enterprising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre of Carthage and even of Marseilles to enlarge the bounds of the world and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean To the Romans the ocean remained  an object of terror rather than of curiosity  The Romans tried to disguise by the pretence of religious awe their ignorance and terror See Tacit Germania c  the whole extent of the Mediterranean after the destruction of Carthage and the extirpation of the pirates was included within their provinces The policy of the emperors was directed only to preserve the peaceful dominion of that sea and to protect the commerce of their subjects With these moderate views Augustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most convenient ports of Italy the one at Ravenna on the Adriatic the other at Misenum in the bay of Naples Experience seems at length to have convinced the ancients that as soon as their gallies exceeded two or at the most three ranks of oars they were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service Augustus himself in the victory of Actium had seen the superiority of his own light frigates they were called Liburnians over the lofty but unwieldy castles of his rival  Plutarch in Marc Anton And yet if we may credit Orosius these monstrous castles were no more than ten feet above the water vi  Of these Liburnians he composed the two fleets of Ravenna and Misenum destined to command the one the eastern the other the western division of the Mediterranean and to each of the squadrons he attached a body of several thousand marines Besides these two ports which may be considered as the principal seats of the Roman navy a very considerable force was stationed at Frejus on the coast of Provence and the Euxine was guarded  by forty ships and three thousand soldiers To all these we add the fleet which preserved the communication between Gaul and Britain and a great number of vessels constantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube to harass the country or to intercept the passage of the barbarians  See Lipsius de Magnitud Rom l i c The sixteen last chapters of Vegetius relate to naval affairs  If we review this general state of the Imperial forces of the cavalry as well as infantry of the legions the

present divided into so many independent and hostile states  Spain the western extremity of the empire  Spain  of Europe and of the ancient world has in every age invariably preserved the same natural limits the Pyrenaean mountains the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean That great peninsula at present so unequally divided between  two sovereigns was distributed by Augustus into three provinces Lusitania Baetica and Tarraconensis The kingdom of Portugal now fills the place of the warlike country of the Lusitanians and the loss sustained by the former on the side of the East is compensated by an accession of territory towards the North The confines of Grenada and Andalusia correspond with those of ancient Baetica The remainder of Spain Gallicia and the Asturias Biscay and Navarre Leon and the two Castilles Murcia Valencia Catalonia and Arragon all contributed to form the third and most considerable of the Roman governments which from the name of its capital was styled the province of Tarragona  See Strabo l ii It is natural enough to suppose that Arragon is derived from Tarraconensis and several moderns who have written in Latin use those words as synonymous It is however certain that the Arragon a little stream which falls from the Pyrenees into the Ebro first gave its name to a country and gradually to a kingdom See d'Anville Geographie du Moyen Age p  Of the native

Loire The country between the Loire and the Seine was styled the Celtic Gaul and soon borrowed a new denomination from the celebrated colony of Lugdunum or Lyons The Belgic lay beyond the Seine and in more ancient times had been bounded only by the Rhine but a little before the age of Caesar the Germans abusing their superiority of valour had occupied a considerable portion of the Belgic territory The Roman conquerors very eagerly embraced so flattering a circumstance and the Gallic frontier of the Rhine from Basil to Leyden received the pompous names of the Upper and the Lower Germany

submission they constituted the western division of the European provinces which extended from the columns of Hercules to the wall of Antoninus and from the mouth of the Tagus to the sources of the Rhine and Danube  Before the Roman conquest the country which  Italy  is now called Lombardy was not considered as a part of Italy It had been occupied by a powerful colony of Gauls who settling themselves along the banks of the Po from Piedmont to Romagna carried their arms and diffused their name from the Alps to the Apennine The  Ligurians dwelt on the rocky coast which now forms the republic of Genoa Venice was yet unborn but the territories of that state which lie to the east of the Adige were inhabited by the Venetians  The Italian Veneti though often confounded with the Gauls were more probably of Illyrian origin See M Freret Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xviii  The middle part of the peninsula that now composes the dutchy of Tuscany and the ecclesiastical

collects the tribute of sixty navigable rivers and is at length through six mouths received into the Euxine which appears scarcely equal to such an accession of waters  Tournefort Voyages en GrÃ¨ce et Asie Mineure lettre xviii  The provinces of the Danube soon acquired the general appellation of Illyricum or the Illyrian frontier  The name of Illyricum originally belonged to the seacoast of the Hadriatic and was gradually extended by the Romans from the Alps to the Euxine Sea See Severini Pannonia l i c  and were esteemed the most warlike of the empire but they deserve to be more particularly considered under the names of Rhaetia Noricum Pannonia Dalmatia Dacia Maesia Thrace Macedonia and Greece  The province of Rhaetia which soon extinguished  Rhaetia  the name of the Vindelicians extended from the summit of the Alps to the banks of the Danube from its source as far as its conflux with the Inn The greatest part of the flat country is subject to the elector of Bavaria the city of Augsburg is protected by the constitution of the German empire the Grisons are safe in their mountains and the country of Tirol is ranked among the numerous provinces of the house of Austria  The wide extent of territory which is included between the Inn the Danube and the Save Austria Styria Carinthia Carniola the Lower  Noricum and Pannonia  Hungary and Sclavonia was known to the ancients under the names of Noricum and Pannonia In their original state of independence their fierce inhabitants were intimately connected Under the Roman government they were frequently united and they still remain the patrimony of a single family They now contain the residence of a German prince who stiles himself Emperor of the Romans and form the center as well as strength of the Austrian power It may not be improper to observe that if we except Bohemia Moravia the northern skirts of Austria and a part of Hungary between the Teyss and the Danube all the other dominions of the House of Austria were comprised within the limits of the Roman empire  Dalmatia to which the name of Illyricum  Dalmatia  more properly belonged was a long but narrow tract between the Save and the Adriatic The best part of the seacoast which still retains its ancient appellation is a province of the Venetian state and the seat of the little republic of Ragusa The inland parts have assumed the Sclavonian names of Croatia and Bosnia the former obeys an Austrian governor the latter a Turkish pasha but the whole country is still infested by tribes of barbarians whose savage independence irregularly marks the doubtful limit of the Christian and Mahometan power  A Venetian traveller the Abbate Fortis has lately given us some account of those very obscure countries But the geography and antiquities of the western Illyricum can be expected only from the munificence of the emperor its sovereign    After the Danube had received the waters of the Teyss and the Save it acquired at least among the Greeks the name of Ister  The Save rises near the confines of  Istria  and was considered by the more early Greeks as the principal stream of the Danube  It formerly  Maesia and Dacia  divided Maesia and Dacia the latter of which as we have already seen was a conquest of Trajan and the only province beyond the river If we inquire into the present state of those countries we shall find that on the left hand of the Danube Temeswar and Transylvania have been annexed after many revolutions to the crown of Hungary whilst the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia acknowledge the supremacy of the Ottoman Porte On the right hand of the Danube Maesia which during the middle ages was broken into the barbarian kingdoms of Servia and Bulgaria is again united in Turkish slavery  The appellation of Roumelia which is still  Thrace Macedonia and Greece  bestowed by the Turks on the extensive countries of Thrace Macedonia and Greece preserves the memory of their ancient state under the Roman empire In the time of the Antonines the martial regions of Thrace from the mountains of Haemus and Rhodope to the Bosphorus and the Hellespont had assumed the form of a province Notwithstanding the change of masters and of religion the new city of Rome founded by Constantine on the banks of the Bosphorus has ever since remained the capital of a great monarchy The kingdom of Macedonia which  under the reign of Alexander gave laws to Asia derived more solid advantages from the policy of the two Philips and with its dependencies of Epirus and Thessaly extended from the Aegean to the Ionian sea When we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos of Sparta and Athens we can scarcely persuade ourselves that so many immortal republics of antient Greece were lost in a single province of the Roman empire which from the superior influence of the Achaean league was usually denominated the province of Achaia  Such was the state of Europe under the Roman  Asia Minor  emperors The provinces of Asia without excepting the transient conquests of Trajan are all comprehended within the limits of the Turkish power But instead of following the arbitrary divisions of despotism and ignorance it will be safer for us as well as more agreeable to observe the indelible characters of nature The name of Asia Minor is attributed with some propriety to the peninsula which confined between the Euxine and the Mediterranean advances from the Euphrates towards Europe The most extensive and flourishing district westward of mount Taurus and the river Halys was dignified by the Romans with the exclusive title of Asia The jurisdiction of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of Troy Lydia and Phrygia the maritime countries of the Pamphylians Lycians and Carians and the Grecian colonies of Ionia which equalled in arts though not in arms the glory of their parent The kingdoms of Bithynia and Pontus possessed the northern side  of the peninsula from Constantinople to Trebizond On the opposite side the province of Cilicia was terminated by the mountains of Syria the inland country separated from the Roman Asia by the river Halys and from Armenia by the Euphrates had once formed the independent kingdom of Cappadocia In this place we may observe that the northern shores of the Euxine beyond Trebizond in Asia and beyond the Danube in Europe acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperors and received at their hands either tributary princes or Roman garrisons Budzak Crim Tartary Circassia and Mingrelia are the modern appellations of those savage countries  See the Periplus of Arrian He examined the coasts of the Euxine when he was governor of Cappadocia    Under the successors of Alexander Syria was  Syria Phoenicia and Palestine  the seat of the Seleucidae who reigned over Upper Asia till the successful revolt of the Parthians confined their dominions between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean When Syria became subject to the Romans it formed the eastern frontier of their empire nor did that province in its utmost latitude know any other bounds than the mountains of Cappadocia to the north and towards the south the confines of Egypt and the Red Sea Phoenicia and Palestine were sometimes annexed to and sometimes separated from the jurisdiction of Syria The former of these was a narrow and rocky coast the latter was a territory scarcely superior to  Wales either in fertility or extent Yet Phoenicia and Palestine will for ever live in the memory of mankind since America as well as Europe has received letters from the one and religion from the other  The progress of religion is well known The use of letters was introduced among the savages of Europe about fifteen hundred years before Christ and the Europeans carried them to America about fifteen centuries after the Christian aera But in a period of three thousand years the Phoenician alphabet received considerable alterations as it passed through the hands of the Greeks and Romans  A sandy desert alike destitute of wood and water skirts along the doubtful confine of Syria from the Euphrates to the Red Sea The wandering life of the Arabs was inseparably connected with their independence and wherever on some spots less barren than the rest they ventured to form any settled habitations they soon became subjects to the Roman empire  Dion Cassius lib

Suez as the boundary of Asia and Africa Dionysius Mela Pliny Sallust Hirtius and Solinus have preferred for that purpose the western branch of the Nile or even the great Catabathmus or descent which last would assign to Asia not only Egypt but part of Libya  By its situation that celebrated kingdom is included within the immense peninsula of Africa but it is accessible only on the side of Asia

The eastern division was considered by the Romans as the more peculiar and proper province of Africa Till the arrival of the Phoenician colonies that fertile country was inhabited by the Libyans the

Tripoli and Tunis The military government of Algiers oppresses the wide extent of Numidia as it was once united under Massinissa and Jugurtha but in the time of Augustus the limits of Numidia were contracted and at least two thirds of the country acquiesced in the name of Mauritania with the epithet of Caesariensis The genuine Mauritania or country of the Moors which from the ancient city of Tingi or Tangier  was distinguished by the appellation of Tingitana is represented by the modern kingdom of Fez SallÃ¨ on the Ocean so infamous at present for its piratical depredations was noticed by

finished the circuit of the Roman empire we may observe that Africa is divided  The Mediterranean with its islands  from Spain by a narrow strait of about twelve miles through which the Atlantic flows

sway the irresistible strength and the real or affected moderation of the emperors they permitted themselves to despise and sometimes to forget the outlying countries which had been left in the enjoyment of a barbarous independence and they gradually usurped the licence of confounding the Roman monarchy with the globe of the earth  Bergier Hist des Grands Chemins l iii c a very useful collection  But the  temper as well as knowledge of a modern historian require a more sober and accurate language He may impress a juster image of the greatness of Rome by observing that the empire was above two thousand miles in breadth from the wall of Antoninus and the northern limits of Dacia to mount Atlas and the tropic of Cancer that it extended in length more than three thousand miles from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates that it was situated in the finest part of the Temperate Zone between the twentyfourth and fiftysixth degrees of northern latitude and that it was supposed to contain above sixteen hundred thousand square miles for the most part of fertile and well cultivated land  See Templeman's Survey of the Globe but I distrust both the doctor's learning and his maps    CHAP II  Of the Union and internal Prosperity of the Roman Empire in the Age of the Antonines  IT is not alone by the rapidity or extent of conquest that we should estimate the greatness of Rome The sovereign of the Russian  Principles of government  deserts commands a larger portion of the globe In the seventh summer after his passage of the Hellespont Alexander erected the Macedonian trophies on the banks of the Hyphasis  They were erected about the midway between Lahor and Dehli The conquests of Alexander in Hindostan were confined to the Punjah a country watered by the five great streams of the Indus  Within less than a century the irresistible Zingis and the Mogul princes of his race spread their cruel devastations and transient empire from the sea of China to the confines of Egypt and Germany  See M de Guignes Histoire des Huns l xv xvi and xvii  But the firm edifice of Roman power was raised and preserved by the wisdom of ages The obedient provinces of Trajan and the Antonines were united by laws and adorned by arts They might occasionally suffer from the partial abuse of delegated authority but the general principle of government was wise simple and beneficent They enjoyed the religion of their ancestors whilst in civil honours and advantages they were exalted by just degrees to an equality with their conquerors  I The policy of the emperors and the senate as far as it concerned religion was happily seconded by the reflections of the enlightened and  Universal spirit of toleration  by the habits of the superstitious part of their subjects The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true by the philosopher as equally false and by the magistrate as equally useful And thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence but even religious concord  The superstition of the people was not embittered  Of the people  by any mixture of theological rancour nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative system The devout polytheist though fondly attached to his national rites admitted with implicit faith the different religions of the earth  There is not any writer who describes in so lively a manner as Herodotus the true genius of Polytheism The best commentary may be found in Mr Hume's Natural History of Religion and the best contrast in Boussuet's Universal History Some obscure traces of an intolerant spirit appear in the conduct of the Egyptians see Juvenal Sat xv and the Christians as well as Jews who lived under the Roman empire formed a very important exception so important indeed that the discussion will require a distinct chapter of this work  Fear gratitude and curiosity a dream or an omen a singular disorder or a distant journey perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his belief and to enlarge the list of his protectors The thin texture of the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not discordant materials As soon as it was allowed that sages and heroes who had lived or  who had died for the benefit of their country were exalted to a state of power and immortality it was universally confessed that they deserved if not the adoration at least the reverence of all mankind The deities of a thousand groves and a thousand streams possessed in peace their local and respective influence nor could the Roman who deprecated the wrath of the Tiber deride the Egyptian who presented his offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile The visible powers of Nature the planets and the elements were the same throughout the universe The invisible governors of the moral world were inevitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory Every virtue and even vice acquired its divine representative every art and profession its patron whose attributes in the most distant ages and countries were uniformly derived from the character of their peculiar votaries A republic of gods of such opposite tempers and interest required in every system the moderating hand of a supreme magistrate who by the progress of knowledge and flattery was gradually invested with the sublime perfections of an Eternal Parent and an Omnipotent Monarch  The rights powers and pretensions of the sovereign of Olympus are very clearly described in the xvth book of the Iliad in the Greek original I mean for Mr Pope without perceiving it has improved the theology of Homer  Such was the mild spirit of antiquity that the nations were less attentive to the difference than to the resemblance of their religious worship The Greek the Roman and the Barbarian as  they met before their respective altars easily persuaded themselves that under various names and with various ceremonies they adored the same deities The elegant mythology of Homer gave a beautiful and almost a regular form to the polytheism of the ancient world  See for instance Caesar de Bell Gall vi Within a century or two the Gauls themselves applied to their gods the names of Mercury Mars Apollo c    The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals  Of philosophers  from the nature of man rather than from that of God They meditated however on the Divine Nature as a very curious and important speculation and in the profound inquiry they displayed the strength and weakness of the human understanding  The admirable work of Cicero de NaturÃ¢ Deorum is she best clue we have to guide us through the dark and profound abyss He represents with candour and confutes with subtlety the opinions of the philosophers  Of the four most celebrated schools the Stoics and the Platonists endeavoured to reconcile the jarring interests of reason and piety They have left us the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections of the first cause but as it was impossible for them to conceive the creation of matter the workman in the Stoic philosophy was not sufficiently distinguished from the work whilst on the contrary the spiritual God of Plato and his disciples resembled an idea rather than a substance The opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less religious cast but whilst the modest science of the former induced them to doubt the positive ignorance  of the latter urged them to deny the providence of a Supreme Ruler The spirit of inquiry prompted by emulation and supported by freedom had divided the public teachers of philosophy into a variety of contending sects but the ingenuous youth who from every part resorted to Athens and the other seats of learning in the Roman empire were alike instructed in every school to reject and to despise the religion of the multitude How indeed was it possible that a philosopher should accept as divine truths the idle tales of the poets and the incoherent traditions of antiquity or that he should adore as gods those imperfect beings whom he must have despised as men Against such unworthy adversaries Cicero condescended to employ the arms of reason and eloquence but the satire of Lucian was a much more adequate as well as more efficacious weapon We may be well assured that a writer conversant with the world would never have ventured to expose the gods of his country to public ridicule had they not already been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and enlightened orders of society  I do not pretend to assert that in this irreligious age the natural terrors of superstition dreams omens apparitions c had lost their efficacy    Notwithstanding the fashionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of the Antonines both the interests of the priests and the credulity of the people were sufficiently respected In their writings and conversation the philosophers of  antiquity asserted the independent dignity of reason but they resigned their actions to the commands of law and of custom Viewing with a smile of pity and indulgence the various errors of the vulgar they diligently practised the ceremonies of their fathers devoutly frequented the temples of the gods and sometimes condescending to act a part on the theatre of superstition they concealed the sentiments of an Atheist under the sacerdotal robes Reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about their respective modes of faith or of worship It was indifferent to them what shape the folly of the multitude might chuse to assume and they approached with the same inward contempt and the same external reverence the altars of the Lybian the Olympian or the Capitoline Jupiter  Socrates Epicurus Cicero and Plutarch always inculcated a decent reverence for the religion of their own country and of mankind The devotion of Epicurus was assiduous and exemplary Diogen Laert x    It is not easy to conceive from what motives a  Of the magistrate  spirit of persecution could introduce itself into the Roman councils The magistrates could not be actuated by a blind though honest bigotry since the magistrates were themselves philosophers and the schools of Athens had given laws to the senate They could not be impelled by ambition or avarice as the temporal and ecclesiastical powers were united in the same hands The pontiffs were chosen among the most illustrious of the senators and the office of Supreme  Pontiff was constantly exercised by the emperors themselves They knew and valued the advantages of religion as it is connected with civil government They encouraged the public festivals which humanize the manners of the people They managed the arts of divination as a convenient instrument of policy and they respected as the firmest bond of society the useful persuasion that either in this or in a future life the crime of perjury is most assuredly punished by the avenging gods  Polybius l vi c Juvenal Sat xiii laments that in his time this apprehension had lost much of its effect  But whilst they acknowledged the general advantages of religion they were convinced that the various modes of worship contributed alike to the same salutary purposes and that in every country the form of superstition which had received the sanction of time and experience was the best adapted to the climate and to its inhabitants Avarice and  In the provinces  taste very

abused and afterwards lost if they are committed to an unwieldy multitude But when the popular assemblies had been suppressed by the administration of the emperors the conquerors were distinguished from the vanquished nations only as the first and most honourable order of subjects and their increase however rapid was no longer exposed to the same dangers  Yet the wisest princes who adopted the maxims of Augustus guarded with the strictest care the dignity of the Roman name and diffused the freedom of the city with a prudent liberality  Maecenas had advised him to declare by one edict all his subjects citizens But we may justly suspect that the historian Dion was the author of a counsel so much adapted to the practice of his own age and so little to that of Augustus    Till the privileges of Romans had been progressively  Italy  extended to all the inhabitants of the empire an important distinction was preserved between Italy and the provinces The former was esteemed the centre of public unity and the firm basis of the constitution Italy claimed the birth or at least the residence of the emperors and the senate  The senators were obliged to have onethird of their own landed property in Italy See Plin l vi ep The qualification was reduced by Marcus to onefourth Since the reign of Trajan Italy had sunk nearer to the level of the provinces  The estates of the Italians were exempt from taxes their persons from the arbitrary jurisdiction of governors Their municipal corporations formed after the perfect model of the capital were intrusted under the immediate eye of the supreme power with the execution of the laws From the foot of the Alps to the extremity of Calabria all the natives of Italy were born citizens of Rome Their partial distinctions were obliterated and they insensibly coalesced into one great nation united by language manners and civil institutions and equal to the weight of a powerful empire The republic gloried in her generous policy and was frequently rewarded by the merit and services of  her adopted sons Had she always confined the distinction of Romans to the ancient families within the walls of the city that immortal name would have been deprived of some of its noblest ornaments Virgil was a native of Mantua Horace was inclined to doubt whether he should call himself an Apulian or a Lucanian it was in Padua that

dissolve those dangerous consederacies which taught mankind that as the Roman arms prevailed by division  they might be resisted by union Those princes whom the ostentation of gratitude or generosity permitted for a while to hold a precarious sceptre were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations The free states and cities which had embraced the cause of Rome were rewarded with a nominal alliance and insensibly sunk into real servitude The public authority was every where exercised by the ministers of the senate and of the emperors and that authority was absolute and without control But the same salutary maxims of government which had secured the peace and obedience of Italy were extended to the most distant conquests A nation of Romans was gradually formed in the provinces by the double expedient of introducing colonies and of admitting the most faithful and deserving of the provincials to the freedom of Rome  Wheresoever the Roman conquers he inhabits  Colonies and municipal towns  is a very just observation of Seneca  Seneca in Consolat ad Helviam c  confirmed by history and experience The natives of Italy allured by pleasure or by interest hastened to enjoy the advantages of victory and we may remark that about forty years after the reduction of Asia eighty thousand Romans were massacred in one day by the cruel orders of Mithridates  Memnon apud Photium c Valer Maxim ix Plutarch and Dion Cassius swell the massacre to citizens but I should esteem the smaller number to be more than sufficient  These voluntary exiles were engaged  for the most part in the occupations of commerce agriculture and the farm of the revenue But after the legions were rendered permanent by the emperors the provinces were peopled by a race of soldiers and the veterans whether they received the reward of their service in land or in money usually settled with their families in the country where they had honourably spent their youth Throughout the empire but more particularly in the western parts the most fertile districts and the most convenient situations were reserved for the establishment of colonies some of which were of a civil and others of a military nature In their manners and internal policy the colonies formed a perfect representation of their great parent and they were soon endeared to the natives by the ties of friendship and alliance they effectually diffused a reverence for the Roman name and a desire which was seldom disappointed of sharing in due time its honours and advantages  Twentyfive colonies were settled in Spain see Plin Hist Natur iii iv and nine in Britain of which London Colchester Lincoln Chester Gloucester and Bath still remain considerable cities see Richard of Cirencester p and Whitaker's History of Manchester l i c  The municipal cities insensibly equalled the rank and splendour of the colonies and in the reign of Hadrian

who performed any public service or displayed any personal talents were rewarded with a present whose value was continually diminished by the increasing liberality of the emperors Yet even in the age of the Antonines when the freedom of the city had been bestowed on the greater number of their subjects it was still accompanied with very solid advantages The bulk of the people acquired with that title the benefit of the Roman laws particularly in the interesting articles of marriage testaments and inheritances and the road of fortune was open to those whose pretensions were seconded by favour or merit The grandsons of the Gauls who had besieged Julius Caesar in Alesia commanded legions governed provinces and were admitted into the senate of Rome  Tacit Annal xi Hist iv  Their ambition

Lipsius de pronunciatione Linguae Latinae c  The ancient dialects of Italy the Sabine the Etruscan and the Venetian sunk into oblivion but in the provinces the east was less docile than the west to the voice of its victorious preceptors This obvious difference marked the two portions of the empire with a distinction of colours which though it was in some degree concealed during the meridian splendor of prosperity became gradually more visible as the shades of night descended upon the Roman world The western countries were civilized by the same hands which subdued them As soon as the barbarians were reconciled to obedience their minds were opened to any new impressions of knowledge and politeness The language of Virgil and Cicero though with some inevitable mixture of corruption was so universally adopted in Africa Spain Gaul Britain and Pannonia  Apuleius and Augustin will answer for Africa Strabo for Spain and Gaul Tacitus in the life of Agricola for Britain and Velleius Paterculus for Pannonia To them we may add the language of the Inscriptions  that the faint traces of the Punic or Celtic idioms were preserved only in the mountains or among the peasants  The Celtic was preserved in the mountains of Wales Cornwall and Armorica We may observe that Apuleius reproaches an African youth who lived among the populace with the use of the Punic whilst he had almost forgot Greek and neither could nor would speak Latin Apolog p The greater part of St Austin's congregations were strangers to the Punic  Education and study insensibly  inspired the natives of those countries with the sentiments of Romans and Italy gave fashions as well as laws to her Latin provincials They solicited with more ardour and obtained with more facility the freedom and honours of the

Scipios would not have disowned for their countryman The situation of the Greeks was very different from that of the barbarians The former had been long since civilized and corrupted They had too much taste to relinquish their language and too much vanity to adopt any foreign institutions Still preserving the prejudices after they had lost the virtues of their ancestors they affected to despise the unpolished manners of the Roman conquerors whilst they were compelled to respect their superior wisdom and power  There is not I believe from Dionysius to Libanius a single Greek critic who mentions Virgil or Horace They seem ignorant that the Romans had any good writers  Nor was the influence of the Grecian language and sentiments confined to the narrow limits of that once celebrated country Their empire by the progress of colonies and conquest had been diffused from the Hadriatic to the Euphrates and the Nile Asia  was covered with Greek cities and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had introduced a silent revolution into Syria and Egypt In their pompous courts those princes united the elegance of Athens with the luxury of the East and the example of the court was imitated at an humble distance by the higher ranks of their subjects Such was the general division of the Roman empire into the Latin and Greek languages To these we may add a third distinction for the body of the natives in Syria and especially in Egypt The use of their ancient dialects by secluding them from the commerce of mankind checked the improvements of those barbarians  The curious reader may see in Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom xix p c how much the use of the Syriac and Egyptian languages was still preserved  The slothful effeminacy of the former exposed them to the contempt the sullen ferociousness of the latter excited the aversion of the conquerors  See Juvenal Sat iii and xv Ammian Marcellin xxii  Those nations had submitted to the Roman power but they seldom desired or deserved the freedom of the city and it was remarked that more than two hundred and thirty years elapsed after the ruin of the Ptolemies before an Egyptian was admitted into the senate of Rome  Dion Cassius l

amusements of the Romans were not suffered to interfere with their sound maxims of policy Whilst they acknowledged the charms of the Greek they asserted the dignity of the Latin tongue and the exclusive use of the latter was inflexibly maintained in the administration of civil as well as military government  See Valerius Maximus l ii c n The emperor Claudius disfranchised an eminent Grecian for not understanding Latin He was probably in some public office Suetonius in Claud c  The two languages exercised at the same time their separate jurisdiction throughout the empire the former as the natural idiom of science the latter as the legal dialect of public transactions Those who united letters with business were equally conversant with both and it was almost impossible in any province to find a Roman subject of a liberal education who was at once a stranger to the Greek and to the Latin language  It was by such institutions that the nations of  Slaves  the empire insensibly melted

of severity in Cicero in Verrem v  and the most cruel treatment seemed almost justified by the great law of selfpreservation But when the principal nations of Europe Asia and Africa were united under the laws of one sovereign the source of foreign supplies flowed with much less abundance and the Romans were reduced to the milder but more tedious method of propagation In their numerous families and particularly in their country estates they encouraged the marriage of their slaves The sentiments of nature the habits of education and the possession of a dependent species of property contributed to alleviate the hardships of servitude  See in Gruter and the other collectors a great number of inscriptions addressed by slaves to their wives children fellowservants masters c They are all most probably of the Imperial age  The existence of a slave became an object of greater value and though his happiness still depended on the temper and circumstances of the master the humanity of the latter instead of being restrained by  fear was encouraged by the sense of his own interest The progress of manners was accelerated by the virtue or policy of the emperors and by the edicts of Hadrian and the Antonines the protection of the laws was extended to the most abject part of mankind The jurisdiction of life and death over the slaves a power long exercised and often abused was taken out of private hands and reserved to the magistrates alone The subterraneous prisons were abolished and upon a just complaint of intolerable treatment the injured slave obtained either his deliverance or a less cruel master  See the Augustan History and a Dissertation of M de Burigny in the xxxvth volume of the Academy of Inscriptions upon the Roman slaves    Hope the best comfort of our imperfect condition  Enfranchisement  was not denied to the Roman slave and if he had any opportunity of rendering himself either useful or agreeable he might very naturally expect that the diligence and fidelity of a few years would be rewarded with the inestimable gift of freedom The benevolence of the master was so frequently prompted by the meaner suggestions of vanity and avarice that the laws found it more necessary to restrain than to encourage a profuse and undistinguishing liberality which might degenerate into a very dangerous abuse  See another Dissertation of M de Burigny in the xxxviith volume on the Roman freedmen  It was a maxim of antient jurisprudence that a slave had not any country of his own he acquired with his liberty an admission into the political  society of which his patron was a member The consequences of this maxim would have prostituted the privileges of the Roman city to a mean and promiscuous multitude Some seasonable exceptions were therefore provided and the honourable distinction was confined to such slaves only as for just causes and with the approbation of the magistrate should receive a solemn and legal manumission Even these chosen freedmen obtained no more than the private rights of citizens and were rigorously excluded from civil or military honours Whatever might be the merit or fortune of their sons  they  likewise were esteemed unworthy of a seat in the senate nor were the traces of a servile origin allowed to be completely obliterated till the third or fourth generation  Spanheim Orbis Roman l i c p c  Without destroying the distinction of ranks a distant prospect of freedom and honours was presented even to those whom pride and prejudice almost disdained to number among the human species  It was once

manufacturer to purchase than to hire his workmen and in the country slaves were employed as the cheapest and most laborious instruments of agriculture To confirm the general observation and to display the multitude of slaves we might allege a variety of particular instances It was discovered on a very melancholy occasion that four hundred slaves were maintained in a single palace of Rome  Tacit Annal xiv They were all executed for not preventing their master's murder  The same number of four hundred belonged to an estate which an African widow of a very private  condition resigned to her son whilst she reserved for herself a much larger share of her property  Apuleius in Apolog p Edit Delphin  A freedman under the reign of Augustus though his fortune had suffered great losses in the civil wars left behind him three thousand six hundred yoke of oxen two hundred and fifty thousand head of smaller cattle and what was almost included in the description of cattle four thousand one hundred and sixteen slaves  Plin Hist Natur l xxxiii    The number of subjects who acknowledged the  Populousness of the Roman empire  laws of Rome of citizens of provincials and of slaves cannot now be fixed with such a degree of accuracy as the importance of the object would deserve We are informed that when the emperor Claudius exercised the office of censor he took an account of six millions nine hundred and fortyfive thousand Roman citizens who with the proportion of women and children must have amounted to about twenty millions of souls The multitude of subjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating But after weighing with attention every circumstance which could influence the balance it seems probable that there existed in the time of Claudius about twice as many provincials as there were citizens of either sex and of every age and that the slaves were at least equal in number to the free inhabitants of the Roman world The total amount of this imperfect calculation would rise to about one hundred and twenty millions of persons a degree of population  which possibly exceeds that of modern Europe  Compute twenty millions in France twentytwo in Germany four in Hungary ten in Italy with its islands eight in Great Britain and Ireland eight in Spain and Portugal ten or twelve in the European Russia six in Poland six in Greece and Turkey four in Sweden

incapable of freedom But the obedience of the Roman world was uniform voluntary and permanent The vanquished nations blended into one great people resigned the hope nay even the wish of resuming their

and was exercised with the same facility on the banks of the Thames or of the Nile as on those of the Tyber The  legions were destined to serve against the public enemy and the civil magistrate seldom required the aid of a military force  Joseph de Bell Judaico l ii c The oration of Agrippa or rather of the historian is a fine picture of the Roman empire  In this state of general security the leisure as well as opulence both of the prince and people were devoted to improve and to adorn the Roman empire  Among the innumerable monuments of architecture  Roman monuments  constructed by the Romans how many have escaped the notice of history how few have resisted the ravages of time and barbarism And yet even the majestic ruins that are still scattered over Italy and the provinces would be sufficient to prove that those countries were once the seat of a polite and powerful empire Their greatness alone or their beauty might deserve our attention but they are rendered more interesting by two important circumstances which connect the agreeable history of the arts with the more useful history of human manners Many of those works were erected at private expence and almost all were intended for public benefit  It is natural to suppose that the greatest number  Many of them erected at private expence  as well as the most considerable of the Roman edifices were raised by the emperors who possessed so unbounded a command both of men and money Augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found his capital of brick and that he had left it of marble  Sueton in August c Augustus built in Rome the temple and forum of Mars the Avenger the temple of Jupiter Tonans in the Capitol that of Apollo Palatine with public libraries the portico and basilica of Caius and Lucius the porticoes of Livia and Octavia and the theatre of Marcellus The example of the sovereign was imitated by his ministers and generals and his friend Agrippa left behind him the immortal monument of the Pantheon  The strict oeconomy  of Vespasian was the source of his magnificence The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius The public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of the empire were executed not only by his orders but under his immediate inspection He was himself an artist and he loved the arts as they conduced to the glory of the monarch They were encouraged by the Antonines as they contributed to the happiness of the people But if the emperors were the first they were not the only architects of their dominions Their example was universally imitated by their principal subjects who were not afraid of declaring to the world that they had spirit to conceive and wealth to accomplish the noblest undertakings Scarcely had the proud structure of the Coliseum been dedicated at Rome before the edifices of a smaller scale indeed but of the same design and materials were erected for the use and at the expence of the cities of Capua and Verona  See Maffei Verona illustrata l iv p  The inscription of the stupendous bridge of Alcantara attests that it was thrown over the Tagus by the contribution of a few Lusitanian communities When Pliny was intrusted with the government of Bithynia and Pontus provinces by no means the richest or most considerable of the empire he found the cities within his jurisdiction striving with each  other in every useful and ornamental work that might deserve the curiosity of strangers or the gratitude of their citizens It was the duty of the Proconsul to supply their deficiencies to direct their taste and sometimes to moderate their emulation  See the xth book of Pliny's Epistles He mentions the following works carried on at the expence of the cities At Nicomedia a new forum an aqueduct and a canal left unfinished by a king at Nice a Gymnasium and a theatre which had already cost near ninety thousand pounds baths at Prusa and Claudiopolis and an aqueduct of sixteen miles in length for the use of Sinope  The opulent senators of Rome and the provinces esteemed it an honour and almost an obligation to adorn the splendour of their age and country and the influence of fashion very frequently supplied the want of taste or generosity Among a crowd of these private benefactors we may select Herodes Atticus an Athenian citizen who lived in the age of the Antonines Whatever might be the motive of his conduct his magnificence would have been worthy of the greatest kings  The family of Herod at least after it had been  Example of Herodes Atticus  favoured by fortune was lineally descended from Cimon and Miltiades Theseus and Cecrops Aeacus and Jupiter But the posterity of so many gods and heroes was fallen into the most abject state His grandfather had suffered by the hands of justice and Julius Atticus his father must have ended his life in poverty and contempt had he not discovered an immense treasure buried under an old house the last remains of his patrimony According to the rigour of law the emperor might have asserted his claim and the  prudent Atticus prevented by a frank confession the officiousness of informers But the equitable Nerva who then filled the throne refused to accept any part of it and commanded him to use without scruple the present of fortune The cautious Athenian still insisted that the treasure was too considerable for a subject and that he knew not how to  use it Abuse it then  replied the monarch with a goodnatured peevishness for it is your own  Hadrian afterwards made a very equitable regulation which divided all treasuretrove between the right of property and that of discovery Hist August p  Many will be of opinion that Atticus literally obeyed the emperor's last instructions since he expended the greatest part of his fortune which was much increased by an advantageous marriage in the service of the Public He had obtained for his son Herod the prefecture of the free cities of Asia and the young magistrate observing that the town of Troas was indifferently supplied with water obtained from the munificence of Hadrian three hundred myriads of drachms about a hundred thousand pounds for the construction of a new

requesting that he might be permitted to take upon himself the whole additional expence  Philostrat in Vit Sophist l ii p    The ablest preceptors of Greece and Asia had been invited by liberal

wife Regilla he dedicated a theatre scarcely to be paralleled in the empire no wood except cedar very curiously carved was employed in any part of the building The Odeum designed by Pericles for musical performances and the rehearsal of new tragedies had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over Barbaric greatness as the timbers employed in the construction consisted chiefly of the masts of the Persian vessels Notwithstanding  the repairs bestowed on that ancient edifice by a king of Cappadocia it was again fallen to decay Herod restored its ancient beauty and magnificence Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen confined to the walls of Athens The most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple of Neptune in the Isthmus a theatre at Corinth a stadium at Delphi a bath at

pictures of Timanthes and of Protogenes are mentioned by Pliny as in the Temple of Peace and the Laocoon was found in the baths of Titus  These monuments of architecture the property of the Roman people were adorned with the most beautiful productions of Grecian painting and sculpture and in the temple of Peace a very curious library was open to the curiosity of the learned At a small distance from thence was situated the Forum of Trajan It was surrounded with a lofty portico in the form of a quadrangle into which four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrance in the centre arose a column of marble whose height of one hundred and ten feet denoted the elevation of the hill that had been cut away This column which still subsists in its ancient beauty exhibited an exact representation of the Dacian victories of its founder The veteran soldier contemplated the story of his own campaigns and by an easy illusion of national vanity the peaceful citizen associated himself to the honours of the triumph All the other quarters of the capital and all the provinces of the empire were embellished by the same liberal spirit of public magnificence and were filled with amphitheatres theatres temples porticos triumphal  arches baths and aqueducts all variously conducive to the health the devotion and the pleasures of the meanest citizen The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention The boldness of the enterprise the solidity of the execution and the uses to which they were subservient rank the aqueducts among the noblest monuments of Roman genius and power The aqueducts of the capital claim a just preeminence but the curious traveller who without the light of history should examine those of Spoleto of Metz or of Segovia would very naturally conclude that those provincial towns had formerly been the residence of some potent monarch The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered with flourishing cities whose populousness and even whose existence was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial stream of fresh water  Montfaucon l'AntiquitÃ© ExpliquÃ©e tom iv p l i c Fabretti has composed a very learned treatise on

to the southeast point of the empire was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty Roman miles  The following Itinerary may serve to convey some idea of the direction of the road and of the

some beneficial conse+quences to mankind and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices diffused  in the western countries of the empire  likewise the improvements of social life In the more remote ages of antiquity the world was unequally divided The east was in the immemorial possession of arts and luxury whilst the west was inhabited by rude and warlike barbarians who either disdained agriculture or to whom it was totally unknown Under the protection of an established government the productions of happier climates and the industry of more civilized nations were gradually introduced into the western countries of Europe and the natives were encouraged by an open and profitable commerce to multiply the former as well as to improve the latter It would be almost impossible to enumerate all the articles either of the animal or the vegetable reign which were successively imported into Europe from Asia and Egypt  It is not improbable that the Greeks and Phoenicians

favourites of fortune united every refinement of convenience of elegance and of splendour whatever could sooth their pride or gratify their sensuality Such refinements under the odious name of luxury have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue as well as happiness of mankind if all possessed the necessaries and none the superfluities of life But in the present imperfect condition of society luxury though it may proceed from vice or folly seems to be the only means that can correct the unequal distribution of property The diligent mechanic and the skilful artist who have obtained no share in the division of the earth receive a voluntary tax from the possessors of land and the latter are prompted by a sense of interest to improve those estates with whose produce they may purchase additional pleasures This operation the particular effects of which are felt in every society acted with much more diffusive energy in the Roman world The provinces would soon have been exhausted of their wealth if the manufactures and commerce of luxury had not insensibly restored to the industrious subjects the sums which  were exacted from them by the arms and authority of Rome As long as the circulation was confined within the bounds of the empire it impressed the political machine with a new degree of activity and its consequences sometimes beneficial could never become pernicious  But it is no easy task to confine luxury within  Foreign trade  the limits of an empire The most remote countries of the ancient world were ransacked to supply the pomp and delicacy of Rome The forest of Scythia afforded some valuable furs Amber was brought over land from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube and the barbarians were astonished at the price which they received in exchange for so useless a commodity  Tacit Germania c Plin Hist Nat xxxviii The latter observed with some humour that even fashion had not yet found out the use of amber Nero sent a Roman knight to purchase great quantities on the spot where it was produced the coast of modern Prussia  There was a considerable demand for Babylonian carpets and other manufactures of the East but the most important and unpopular branch of foreign trade was carried on with Arabia and India Every year about the time of the summer solstice a fleet of an hundred and twenty vessels sailed from Myoshormos a port of Egypt on the Red Sea By the periodical assistance of the Monsoons they traversed the ocean in about forty days The coast of Malabar or the island of Ceylon  Called Taprobana by the Romans and Screndib by the Arabs It was discovered under the reign of Claudius and gradually became the principal mart of the East  was the usual term of their navigation and it was in those markets that the  merchants from the more remote countries of Asia expected their arrival The return of the fleet of Egypt was fixed to the months of December or January and as soon as their rich cargo had been transported on the backs of camels from the Red Sea to the Nile and had descended that river as far as Alexandria it was poured without delay into the capital of the empire  Plin Hist Natur l vi Strabo l xvii  The objects of oriental traffic were splendid and trifling silk a pound of which was esteemed not inferior in value to a pound of gold  Hist August p A silk garment was considered as an ornament to a woman but as a disgrace to a man  precious stones among which the pearl claimed the first rank after the diamond  The two great pearl fisheries were the same as at present Ormuz and Cape Comorin As well as we can compare ancient with modern geography Rome was supplied with diamonds from the mine of Jumelpur in Bengal which is described in the Voyages de Tavernier tom ii p  and a variety of aromatics that were consumed in religious worship and the pomp of funerals The labour and risk of the voyage was rewarded with almost incredible profit but the profit was made upon Roman subjects and a few individuals were enriched at the expence of the Public As the natives of Arabia and India were  Gold and silver  contented with the productions and manufactures of their own country silver on the side of the Romans was the principal if not the only instrument of commerce It was a complaint worthy of the gravity of the senate that in the purchase of female ornaments the wealth of the state  was irrecoverably given away to foreign and hostile nations  Tacit Annal iii In a speech of Tiberius  The annual loss is computed by a writer of an inquisitive but censorious temper at upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling  Plin Hist Natur xii In another place he computes half that sum Quingenties H S for India exclusive of Arabia  Such was the style of discontent brooding over the dark prospect of approaching poverty And yet if we compare the proportion between gold and silver as it stood in the time of Pliny and as it was fixed in the reign of Constantine we shall discover within that period a very considerable increase  The proportion which was to and Â½ rose to â…– the legal regulation of Constantine See Arbuthnot's Tables of ancient Coins c v  There is not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce it is therefore evident that silver was grown more common that whatever might be the amount of the Indian and Arabian exports they were far from exhausting the wealth of the Roman world and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the demands of commerce  Notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to exalt the past and to depreciate the present the tranquil and prosperous state of the empire was warmly felt and honestly confessed by the provincials as well as Romans  They acknowledged  General felicity  that the true principles of social life laws agriculture and science which had been first invented by the wisdom of Athens were now firmly established by the power of Rome  under whose auspicious influence the fiercest barbarians were united by an equal government and common language They affirm that with the improvement of arts the human species was visibly multiplied They celebrate the increasing splendour of the cities the beautiful face of the country cultivated and adorned like an immense garden and the long festival of peace which was enjoyed by so many nations forgetful of their ancient animosities and delivered from the apprehension of future danger  Among many other passages see Pliny Hist Natur iii Aristides de Urbe RomÃ¢ and Tertullian de AnimÃ¢ c    Whatever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and declamation which seems to prevail in these passages the substance of them is perfectly agreeable to historic truth  It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries  Decline of courage  should discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and corruption This long peace and the uniform government of the Romans introduced a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire The minds of men were gradually reduced to the same level the fire of genius was extinguished and even the military spirit evaporated The natives of Europe were brave and robust Spain Gaul Britain and Illyricum supplied the legions with excellent soldiers and constituted the real strength of the monarchy Their personal valour remained but they no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence  the sense of national honour the presence of danger and the habit of command They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army The posterity of their boldest leaders was contented with the rank of citizens and subjects The most aspiring spirits resorted to the court or standard of the emperors and the deserted provinces deprived of political strength or union insensibly sunk into the languid indifference of private life  The love of letters almost inseparable from  of genius  peace and refinement was fashionable among the subjects of Hadrian and the Antonines who were themselves men of learning and curiosity It was diffused over the whole extent of their empire the most northern tribes of Britons had acquired a taste for rhetoric Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and studied on the banks of the Rhine and Danube and the most liberal rewards sought out the faintest glimmerings of literar merit  Herodes Atticus gave the sophist Polemo above eight thousand pounds for three declamations See Philostrat l i p The Antonines founded a school at Athens in which professors of grammar rhetoric politics and the four great sects of philosophy were maintained at the public expence for the instruction of youth The salary of a philosopher was ten thousand drachmae between three and four hundred pounds a year Similar establishments were formed in the other great cities of the empire See Lucian in Eunuch tom ii p edit Reitz Philostrat l ii p Hist August p Dion Cassius l lxxi p Juvenal himself in a morose satire which in every line betrays his own disappointment and envy is obliged however to say  O Juvenes circumspicit et agitat vos  Materiamque sibi Ducis indulgentia quaerit  Satir vii  The sciences of physic and astronomy  were successfully cultivated by the Greeks the observations of Ptolemy and the writings of Galen are studied by those who have improved their discoveries and corrected their errors but if we except the inimitable Lucian this age of indolence passed away without having produced a single writer of original genius or who excelled in the arts of elegant composition The authority of Plato and Aristotle of Zerno and Epicurus still reigned in the schools and their systems transmitted with blind deference from one generation of disciples to another precluded every generous attempt to exercise the powers or enlarge the limits of the human mind The beauties of the poets and orators instead of kindling a fire like their own inspired only cold and servile imitations or if any ventured to deviate from those models they deviated at the same time from good sense and propriety On the revival of letters the youthful vigour of the imagination after a long repose national emulation a new religion new languages and a new world called forth the genius of Europe But the provincials of Rome trained by a uniform artificial foreign education were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients who by expressing their genuine feelings in their native tongue had already occupied every place of honour The name of Poet was almost forgotten that of Orator was usurped by the sophists A cloud of critics of compilers of commentators darkened the face of learning and the decline of genius was soon followed by the corruption of taste  The sublime Longinus who in somewhat a later period and in the court of a Syrian queen preserved the spirit of ancient Athens observes  Degeneracy  and laments this degeneracy of his contemporaries which debased their sentiments enervated their courage and depressed their talents  In the same manner says he as some children always remain pigmies whose infant limbs have been too closely confined thus our tender minds fettered by the prejudices and habits of a just servitude are unable to expand themselves or to attain that wellproportioned greatness which we admire in the ancients who living under a popular government wrote with the same freedom as they acted  Longin de Sublim c p edit Toll Here too we may say of Longinus  his own example strengthens all his laws  Instead of proposing his sentiments with a manly boldness he insinuates them with the most guarded caution puts them into the mouth of a friend and as far as we can collect from a corrupted text makes a shew of refuting them himself    This diminutive stature of mankind if we pursue the metaphor was daily sinking below the old standard and the Roman world was indeed peopled by a race of pygmies when the fierce giants of the north broke in and mended the puny breed They restored a manly spirit of freedom and after the revolution of ten centuries freedom became the happy parent of taste and science  CHAP III  Of the Constitution of the Roman Empire in the Age of the Antonines  THE obvious definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a state in which a single person by whatsoever name he may be distinguished  Idea of a monarchy  is intrusted with the execution of the laws the management of the revenue and the command of the army But unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon degenerate into despotism The influence of the clergy in an age of superstition might be usefully employed to assert the rights of mankind but so intimate is the connexion between the throne and the altar that the banner of the church has very seldom been seen on the side of the people A martial nobility and stubborn commons possessed of arms tenacious of property and collected into constitutional assemblies form the only balance capable of preserving a free constitution against enterprises of an aspiring prince  Every barrier of the Roman constitution had  Situation of Augustus  been levelled by the vast ambition of the dictator every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the Triumvir After the victory of Actium the fate of the Roman world depended on the will of Octavianus surnamed Caesar by his uncle's adoption and afterwards Augustus  by the flattery of the senate The conqueror was at the head of fortyfour veteran legions  Orosius vi  conscious of their own strength and of the weakness of the constitution habituated during twenty years civil war to every act of blood and violence and passionately devoted to the house of Caesar from whence alone they had received and expected the most lavish rewards The provinces long oppressed by the ministers of the republic sighed for the government of a single person who would be the master not the accomplice of those petty tyrants The people of Rome viewing with a secret pleasure the humiliation of the aristocracy demanded only bread and public shows and were supplied with both by the liberal hand of Augustus The rich and polite Italians who had almost universally embraced the philosophy of Epicurus enjoyed the present blessings of ease and tranquillity and suffered not the pleasing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom With its power the senate had lost its dignity many of the most noble families were extinct The republicans of spirit and ability had perished in the field of battle or in the proscription The door of the assembly had been designedly left open for a mixed multitude of more than a thousand persons who reflected disgrace upon their rank instead of deriving honour from it  Julius Caesar introduced soldiers strangers and halfbarbarians into the senate Sueton in Caesar c The abuse became still more scandalous after his death    The reformation of the senate was one of the first steps in which Augustus laid aside the tyrant and professed himself the father of his  He reforms the senate  country He was elected censor and in concert with his faithful Agrippa he examined the list of the senators expelled a few members whose vices or whose obstinacy required a public example persuaded near two hundred to prevent the shame of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat raised the qualification of a senator to about ten thousand pounds created a sufficient number of Patrician families and accepted for himself the honourable title of Prince of the Senate which had always been bestowed by the censors on the citizen the most eminent for his honours and services  Dion Cassius l iii p Suetonius in August c  But whilst he thus restored the dignity he destroyed the independence of the senate The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost when the legislative power is nominated by the executive  Before an assembly thus modelled and prepared  Resigns his usurped power  Augustus pronounced a studied oration which displayed his patriotism and disguised his ambition  He lamented yet excused his past conduct Filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of his father's murder the humanity of his own nature had sometimes given way to the stern laws of necessity and to a forced connexion with two unworthy colleagues as long as Antony lived the republic  forbad him to abandon her to a degenerate Roman and a barbarian queen He was now at liberty to satisfy his duty and his inclination He solemnly restored the senate and people to all their ancient rights and wished only to mingle with the crowd of his fellowcitizens and to share the blessings which he had obtained for his country  Dion l liii p gives us a prolix and bombast speech on this great occasion I have borrowed from Suetonius and Tacitus the general language of Augustus    It would require the pen of Tacitus if Tacitus  Is prevailed upon to resume it under the title of Emperor or General  had assisted at this assembly to describe the various emotions of the senate those that were suppressed and those that were affected It was dangerous to trust the sincerity of Augustus to seem to distrust it was still more dangerous The respective advantages of monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers the present greatness of the Roman state the corruption of manners and the licence of the soldiers supplied new arguments to the advocates of monarchy and these general views of government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each individual Amidst this confusion of sentiments the answer of the senate was unanimous and decisive They refused to accept the resignation of Augustus they conjured him not to desert the republic which he had saved After a decent resistance the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate and consented to receive the government of the provinces  and the general command of the Roman armies under the wellknown names of PROCONSUL and IMPERATOR  Imperator  from which we have derived Emperor signified under the republic no more than  general  and was emphatically bestowed by the soldiers when on the field of battle they proclaimed their victorious leader worthy of that title When the Roman  emperors  assumed it in that sense they placed it after their name and marked how often they had taken it  But he would receive them only for ten years Even before the expiration of that period he hoped that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed and that the republic restored to its pristine health and vigour would no longer require the dangerous interposition of so extraordinary a magistrate The memory of this comedy repeated several times during the life of Augustus was preserved to the last ages of the empire by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of Rome always solemnized the tenth years of their reign  Dion l liii p c    Without any violation of the principles of the  Power of the Roman generals  constitution the general of the Roman armies might receive and exercise an authority almost despotic over the soldiers the enemies and the subjects of the republic With regard to the soldiers the jealousy of freedom had even from the earliest ages of Rome given way to the hopes of conquest and a just sense of military discipline The dictator or consul had a right to command the service of the Roman youth and to punish an obstinate or cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious penalties  by striking the offender out of the list of citizens by confiscating his property and by selling his person into slavery  Livy Epitom l xiv Valer Maxim vi  The most sacred rights of freedom confirmed by the Porcian and Sempronian laws were suspended by the military engagement In his camp the general exercised an absolute power of life and death his jurisdiction was not confined by any forms of trial or rules of proceeding and the execution of the sentence was immediate and without appeal  See in the viiith book of Livy the conduct of Manlius Torquatus and Papirius Cursor They violated the laws of nature and humanity but they asserted those of military discipline and the people who abhorred the action was obliged to respect the principle  The choice of the enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legislative authority The most important resolutions of peace and war were seriously debated in the senate and solemnly ratified by the people But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great distance from Italy the generals assumed the liberty of directing them against whatever people and in whatever manner they judged most advantageous for the public service It was from the success not from the justice of their enterprises that they expected the honours of a triumph In the use of victory especially after they were no longer controlled by the commissioners of the senate they exercised the most unbounded despotism When Pompey commanded in the east he rewarded his soldiers and allies dethroned princes  divided kingdoms founded colonies and distributed the treasures of Mithridates On his return to Rome he obtained by a single act of the senate and people the universal ratification of all his proceedings  By the lavish but unconstrained suffrages of the people Pompey had obtained a military command scarcely inferior to that of Augustus Among the extraordinary acts of power executed by the former we may remark the foundation of twentynine cities and the distribution of three or four millions sterling to his troops The ratification of his acts met with some opposition and delays in the senate See Plutarch Appian Dion Cassius and the first book of the epistles to Atticus  Such was the power over the soldiers and over the enemies of Rome which was either granted to or assumed by the generals of the republic They were at the same time the governors or rather monarchs of the conquered provinces united the civil with the military character administered justice as well as the finances and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the state  From what has been already observed in the  Lieutenants of the emperor  first chapter of this work some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus intrusted to the ruling hand of Augustus But as it was impossible that he could personally command the legions of so many distant frontiers he was indulged by the senate as Pompey had already been in the permission of devolving the execution of his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants In rank and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient proconsuls but their station was dependent and precarious They received and held their commissions at  the will of a superior to whose  auspicious  influence the merit of their action was legally attributed  Under the commonwealth a triumph could only be claimed by the general who was authorised to take the Auspices in the name of the people By an exact consequence drawn from this principle of policy and religion the triumph was reserved to the emperor and his most successful lieutenants were satisfied with some marks of distinction which under the name of triumphal honours were invented in their favour  They were the representatives of the emperor The emperor alone was the general of the republic and his jurisdiction civil as well as military extended over all the conquests of Rome It was some satisfaction however to the senate that he always delegated his power to the members of their body The Imperial lieutenants were of consular or praetorian dignity the legions were commanded by senators and the praefecture of Egypt was the only important trust committed to a Roman knight  Within six days after Augustus had been compelled  Division of the provinces between the emperor and the senate  to accept so very liberal a grant he resolved to gratify the pride of the senate by an easy sacrifice He represented to them that they had enlarged his powers even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy condition of the times They had not permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and the frontiers but he must insist on being allowed to restore the more peaceful and secure provinces to the mild administration of the civil magistrate In the division of the provinces Augustus provided for his own power  and for the dignity of the republic The proconsuls of the senate particularly those of Asia Greece and Africa enjoyed a more honourable character than the lieutenants of the emperor who commanded in Gaul or Syria The former were attended by lictors the latter by soldiers A law was passed that wherever the emperor was present his extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary jurisdiction of the governor a custom was introduced that the new conquests belonged to the Imperial portion and it was soon discovered that the authority of the  Prince  the favourite epithet of Augustus was the same in every part of the empire  In return for this imaginary concession Augustus  The former preserves his military command and guards in Rome itself  obtained an important privilege which rendered him master of Rome and Italy By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims he was authorized to preserve his military command supported by a numerous body of guards even in time of peace and in the heart of the capital His command indeed was confined to those citizens who were engaged in the service by the military oath but such was the propensity of the Romans to servitude that the oath was voluntarily taken by the magistrates the senators and the equestrian order till the homage of flattery was insensibly converted into an annual and solemn protestation of fidelity  Although Augustus considered a military force  Consular and tribunitian powers  as the firmest foundation he wisely rejected it as a very odious instrument of government It was more agreeable to his temper as well as to his  policy to reign under the venerable names of ancient magistracy and artfully to collect in his own person all the scattered rays of civil jurisdiction With this view he permitted the senate to confer upon him for his life the powers of the consular  Cicero de Legibus iii gives the consular office the name of  Regia potestas  and Polybius l vi c observes three powers in the Roman constitution The monarchical was represented and exercised by the Consuls  and tribunitian offices  As the tribunitian power distinct from the annual office was first invented for the dictator Caesar Dion l xliv p we may easily conceive that it was given as a reward for having so nobly asserted by arms the sacred rights of the tribunes and people See his own Commentaries de Bell Civil l i  which were in the same manner continued to all his successors The consuls had succeeded to the kings of Rome and represented the dignity of the state They superintended the ceremonies of religion levied and commanded the legions gave audience to foreign ambassadors and presided in the assemblies both of the senate and people The general control of the finances was intrusted to their care and though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person they were considered as the supreme guardians of law equity and the public peace Such was their ordinary jurisdiction but whenever the senate empowered the first magistrate to consult the safety of the commonwealth he was raised by that degree above the laws and exercised in the defence of liberty a temporary despotism  Augustus exercised nine annual consulships without interruption He then most artfully refused that magistracy as well as the dictatorship absented himself from Rome and waited till the fatal effects of tumult and faction forced the senate to invest him with a perpetual consulship Augustus as well as his successors affected however to conceal so invidious a title    The character of the tribunes was in every respect different from that of the consuls The appearance of the former was modest and humble but their persons were sacred and inviolable Their force was suited rather for opposition than for action They were instituted to defend the oppressed to pardon offences to arraign the enemies of the people and when they judged it necessary to stop by a single word the whole machine of government As long as the republic subsisted the dangerous influence which either the consul or the tribune might derive from their respective jurisdiction was diminished by several important restrictions Their authority expired with the year in which they were elected the former office was divided between two the latter among ten persons and as both in their private and public interest they were averse to each other their mutual conflicts contributed for the most part to strengthen rather than to destroy the balance of the constitution But when the consular and tribunitian powers were united when they were vested for life in a single person when the general of the army was at the same time the minister of the senate and the representative of the Roman people it was impossible to resist the exercise nor was it easy to define the limits of his Imperial prerogative  To these accumulated honours the policy of Augustus soon added the splendid as well as important dignities of supreme pontiff and of censor  Imperial prerogatives  By the former he acquired the management of the religion and by the latter a legal inspection over the manners and fortunes of the Roman people If so many distinct and independent powers did not exactly unite with each other the complaisance of the senate was prepared to supply every deficiency by the most ample and extraordinary concessions The emperors as the first ministers of the republic were exempted from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws they were authorized to convoke the senate to make several motions in the same day to recommend candidates for the honours of the state to enlarge the bounds of the city to employ the revenue at their discretion to declare peace and war to ratify treaties and by a most comprehensive clause they were empowered to execute whatsoever they should judge advantageous to the empire and agreeable to the majesty of things private or public human or divine  See a fragment of a Decree of the Senate conferring on the emperor Vespasian all the powers granted to his predecessors Augustus Tiberius and Claudius This curious and important monument is published in Gruter's Inscriptions No ccxlii    When all the various powers of executive government  The magistrates  were committed to the  Imperial magistrate  the ordinary magistrates of the commonwealth languished in obscurity without vigour and almost without business The names and  forms of the ancient administration were preserved by Augustus with the most anxious care The usual number of consuls praetors and tribunes  Two consuls were created on the Calends of January but in the course of the year others were substituted in their places till the annual number seems to have amounted to no less than twelve The praetors were usually sixteen or eighteen Lipsius in Excurs Dad Tacit Annal l i I have not mentioned the Aediles or Quaestors Officers of the police or revenue easily adapt themselves to any form of government In the time of Nero the tribunes legally possessed the right of  intercession  though it might be dangerous to exercise it Tacit Annal xvi In the time of Trajan it was doubtful whether the tribuneship was an office or a name Plin Epist i  were annually invested with their respective ensigns of office and continued to discharge some of their least important functions Those honours still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans and the emperors themselves though invested for life with the powers of the consulship frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity which they condescended to share with the most illustrious of their fellowcitizens  The tyrants themselves were ambitious of the consulship The virtuous princes were moderate in the pursuit and exact in the discharge of it Trajan revived the ancient oath and swore before the consul's tribunal that he would observe the laws Plin Panegyric c  In the election of these magistrates the people during the reign of Augustus were permitted to expose all the inconveniences of a wild democracy That artful prince instead of discovering the least symptom of impatience humbly solicited their suffrages for himself or his friends and scrupulously practised all the duties  of an ordinary candidate  Quoties Magistratuum Comitiis interesset Tribus cum candidatis suis circuibat supplicabatque more solemni Ferebat et ipse suffragium in tribubus ut unus e populo Suetonius in August c  But we may venture to ascribe to his councils the first measure of the succeeding reign by which the elections were transferred to the senate  Tum primum Comitia e campo ad patres translata sunt Tacit Annal i The word  primum  seems to allude to some faint and unsuccessful efforts which were made towards restoring them to the people  The assemblies of the people were for ever abolished and the emperors were delivered from a dangerous multitude who without restoring liberty might have disturbed and perhaps endangered the established government  By declaring themselves the protectors of the  The senate  people Marius and Caesar had subverted the constitution of their country But as soon as the senate had been humbled and disarmed such an assembly consisting of five or six hundred persons was found a much more tractable and useful instrument of dominion It was on the dignity of the senate that Augustus and his successors founded their new empire and they affected on every occasion to adopt the language and principles of Patricians In the administration of their own powers they frequently consulted the great national council and  seemed  to refer to its decision the most important concerns of peace and war Rome Italy and the internal provinces were subject to the immediate jurisdiction of the senate With regard to civil objects  it was the supreme court of appeal with regard to criminal matters a tribunal constituted for the trial of all offences that were committed by men in any public station or that affected the peace and majesty of the Roman people The exercise of the judicial power became the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate and the important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence As a council of state and as a court of justice the senate possessed very considerable prerogatives but in its legislative capacity in which it was supposed virtually to represent the people the rights of sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly Every power was derived from their authority every law was ratified by their sanction Their regular meetings were held on three stated days in every month the Calends the Nones and the Ides The debates were conducted with decent freedom and the emperors themselves who gloried in the name of senators sat voted and divided with their equals  To resume in a few words the system of the  General idea of the Imperial system  Imperial government as it was instituted by Augustus and maintained by those princes who understood their own interest and that of the people it may be defined an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth The masters of the Roman world surrounded their throne with darkness concealed their irresistible strength and humbly prosessed themselves  the accountable ministers of the senate whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed  Dion Cassius l liii p has given a very loose and partial sketch of the Imperial system To illustrate and often to correct him I have meditated Tacitus examined Suetonius and consulted the following moderns the AbbÃ© de la Bleterie in the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions

Verona Illustrata p i p c    The face of the court corresponded with the  Court of the emperors  forms of the administration The emperors if we except those tyrants whose capricious folly violated every law of nature and decency difdained that pomp and ceremony which might offend their countrymen but could add nothing to their real power In all the offices of life they affected to confound themselves with their subjects and maintained with them an equal intercourse of visits and entertainments Their habit their palace their table were suited only to the rank of an opulent senator Their family however numerous or splendid was composed entirely of their domestic slaves and freedmen  A weak prince will always be governed by his domestics The power of slaves aggravated the shame of the Romans and the senate paid court to a Pallas or a Narcissus There is a chance that a modern favourite may be a gentleman  Augustus or Trajan would have blushed at employing the meanest of the Romans in those menial offices which in the household and bedchamber of a limited monarch are so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of Britain  The deification of the emperors  See a treatise of Vandale de Consecratione Principium It would be easier for me to copy than it has been to verify the quotations of that learned Dutchman  is the only instance in which they departed from their accustomed prudence and modesty The Asiatic  Deification  Greeks were the first inventors the successors of Alexander the first objects of this servile and impious mode of adulation It was easily transferred from the kings to the governors of Asia and the Roman magistrates very frequently were adored as provincial deities with the pomp of altars and temples of festivals and sacrifices  See a dissertation of the AbbÃ© Mongault in the first volume of the Academy of Inscriptions  It was natural that the emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted and the divine honours which both the one and the other received from the provinces attested rather the despotism than the servitude of Rome But the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations in the arts of flattery and the imperious spirit of the first Caesar too easily consented to assume during his lifetime a place among the tutelar deities of Rome The milder temper of his successor declined so dangerous an ambition which was never afterwards revived except by the madness of Caligula and Domitian Augustus permitted indeed some of the provincial cities to erect temples to his honour on condition that they should associate the worship of Rome with that of the sovereign he tolerated private superstition  of which he might be the object  Jurandasque tuum per nomen ponimus  aras  says Horace to the emperor himself and Horace was well acquainted with the court of Augustus  but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and people in his human character and wisely left to his successor the care of his public deification A regular custom was introduced that on the decease of every emperor who had neither lived nor died like a tyrant the senate by a solemn decree should place him in the number of the gods and the ceremonies of his Apotheosis were blended with those of his funeral This legal and as it should seem injudicious profanation so abhorrent to our stricter principles was received with a very faint murmur  See Cicero in Philippic i Julian in Caesaribus Inque DeÃ»m templis jurabit Roma per umbras is the indignant expression of Lucan but it is a patriotic rather than a devout indignation  by the easy nature of Polytheism but it was received as an institution not of religion but of policy We should disgrace the virtues of the Antonines by comparing them with the vices of Hercules or Jupiter Even the character of Caesar or Augustus were far superior to those of the popular deities But it was the misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened age and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a mixture of fable and mystery as the devotion of the vulgar requires As soon as their divinity was established by law it sunk into oblivion without contributing either to their own fame or to the dignity of succeeding princes  In the consideration of the Imperial government we have frequently mentioned the artful founder under his wellknown title of Augustus  Titles of  Augustus  and  Caesar  which was not however conferred upon him till the edifice was almost completed The obscure name of Octavianus he derived from a mean family in the little town of Aricia It was stained with the blood of the proscription and he was desirous had it been possible to erase all memory of his former life The illustrious surname of Caesar he had assumed as the adopted son of the dictator but he had too much good sense either to hope to be confounded or to wish to be compared with that extraordinary man It was proposed in the senate to dignify their minister with a new appellation and after a very serious discussion that of Augustus was chosen among several others as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity which he uniformly affected  Dion Cassius l liii p with the curious Annotations of Reymar    Augustus  was therefore a personal  Caesar  a family distinction The former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed and however the latter was diffused by adoption and female alliance Nero was the last prince who could allege any hereditary claim to the honours of the Julian line But at the time of his death the practice of a century had inseparably connected those appellations with the Imperial dignity and they have been preserved by a long succession of  emperors Romans Greeks Franks and Germans from the fall of the republic to the present time A distinction was however soon introduced The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the monarch whilst the name of Caesar was more freely communicated to his relations and from the reign of Hadrian at least was appropriated to the second person in the state who was considered as the presumptive heir of the empire  The tender respect of Augustus for a free constitution  Character and policy of Augustus  which he had destroyed can only be explained by an attentive consideration of the character of that subtle tyrant A cool head an unfeeling heart and a cowardly disposition prompted him at the age of nineteen to assume the mask of hypocrisy which he never afterwards laid aside With the same hand and probably with the same temper he signed the proscription of Cicero and the pardon of Cinna His virtues and even his vices were artificial and according to the various dictates of his interest he was at first the enemy and at last the father of the Roman world  As Octavianus advanced to the banquet of the Caesars his colour changed like that of the Camelion pale at first then red afterwards black he at last assumed the mild livery of Venus and the graces Caesars p This image employed by Julian in his ingenious fiction is just and elegant but when he considers this change of character as real and ascribes it to the power of philosophy he does too much honour to philosophy and to Octavianus  When he framed the artful system of the Imperial authority his moderation was inspired by his fears He wished to  deceive the people by an image of civil liberty and the armies by an image of civil government  I The death of Caesar was ever before his  Image of liberty for the people  eyes He had lavished wealth and honours on his adherents but the most favoured friends of his uncle were in the number of the conspirators The fidelity of the legions might defend his authority against open rebellion but their vigilance could not secure his person from the dagger of a determined republican and the Romans who revered the memory of Brutus  Two centuries after the establishment of monarchy the emperor Marcus Antoninus recommends the character of Brutus as a perfect model of Roman virtue  would applaud the imitation of his virtue Caesar had provoked his fate as much by the ostentation of his power as by his power itself The consul or the tribune might have reigned in peace The title of king had armed the Romans against his life Augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom A feeble senate and enervated people cheerfully acquiesced in the pleasing illusion as long as it was supported by the virtue or even by the prudence of the successors of Augustus It was a motive of selfpreservation not a principle of liberty that animated the conspirators against Caligula Nero and Domitian They attacked  the person of the tyrant without aiming their blow at the authority of the emperor  There appears indeed  one  memorable occasion  Attempt of the senate after the death of Caligula  in which the senate after seventy years of patience made an ineffectual attempt to reassume its long forgotten rights When the throne was vacant by the murder of Caligula the consuls convoked that assembly in the Capitol condemned the memory of the Caesars gave the watchword  liberty  to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to their standard and during eight and forty hours acted as the independent chiefs of a free commonwealth But while they deliberated the Praetorian guards had resolved The stupid Claudius brother of Germanicus was already in their camp invested with the Imperial purple and prepared to support his election by arms The dream of liberty was at an end and the senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude Deserted by the people and threatened by a military force that feeble assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the Praetorians and to embrace the benefit of an amnesty which Claudius had the prudence to offer and the generosity to observe  It is much to be regretted that we have lost the part of Tacitus which treated of that transaction We are forced to content ourselves with the popular rumours of Josephus and the imperfect hints of Dion and Sueton    II The insolence of the armies inspired Augustus  Image of government for the armies  with fears of a still more alarming nature The despair of the citizens could only attempt what the power of the soldiers was at any time  able to execute How precarious was his own authority over men whom he had taught to violate every social duty He had heard their seditious clamours he dreaded their calmer moments of reflection One revolution had been purchased by immense rewards but a second revolution might double those rewards The troops professed the fondest attachment to the house of Caesar but the attachments of the multitude are capricious and inconstant Augustus summoned to his aid whatever remained in those fierce minds of Roman prejudices enforced the rigour of discipline by the sanction of law and interposing the majesty of the senate between the emperor and the army boldly claimed their allegiance as the first magistrate of the republic  Augustus restored the ancient severity of discipline After the civil wars he dropped the endearing name of FellowSoldiers and called them only Soldiers Sueton in August c See the use Tiberius made of the senate in the mutiny of the Pannonian legions Tacit Annal i    During a long period of two hundred and  Their obedience  twenty years from the establishment of this artful system to the death of Commodus the dangers inherent to a military government were in a great measure suspended The soldiers were seldom roused to that fatal sense of their own strength and of the weakness of the civil authority which was before and afterwards productive of such dreadful calamities Caligula and Domitian were assassinated in their palace by their own domestics the convulsions which agitated Rome on the death of the former were confined to the walls of the city But Nero involved the  whole empire in his ruin In the space of eighteen months four princes perished by the sword and the Roman world was shaken by the fury of the contending armies Excepting only this short though violent eruption of military licence the two centuries from Augustus to Commodus passed away unstained with civil blood and undisturbed by revolutions The emperor was elected by  the authority of the senate  and  the consent of the soldiers  These words seem to have been the constitutional language See Tacit Annal xiii  The legions respected their oath of fidelity and it requires a minute inspection of the Roman annals to discover three inconsiderable rebellions which were all suppressed in a few months and without even the hazard of a battle  The first was Camillus Scribonianus who took up arms in Dalmatia against Claudius and was deserted by his own troops in five days The second L Antonius in Germany who rebelled against Domitian and the third Avidius Cassius in the reign of M Antoninus The two last reigned but a few months and were cut off by their own adherents We may observe that both Camillus and Cassius coloured their ambition with the design of restoring the republic a task said Cassius peculiarly reserved for his name and family    In elective monarchies the vacancy of the  Designation of a successor  throne is a moment big with danger and mischief The Roman emperors desirous to spare the legions that interval of suspense and the temptation of an irregular choice invested their designed successor with so large a share of present power as should enable him after their decease to assume the remainder without suffering the empire to perceive the change of masters Thus  Augustus after all his fairer prospects had been snatched from him by untimely deaths rested his last hopes on Tiberius obtained for his adopted  Of Tiberius

Sueton in Tiber c  Thus Vespasian  Of Titus  subdued the generous mind of his eldest son Titus was adored by the eastern legions which under his command had recently atchieved the conquest of Judaea His power was dreaded and as his virtues were clouded by the intemperance of youth his designs were suspected Instead of listening to such unworthy suspicions the prudent monarch associated Titus to the full powers of the Imperial dignity and the grateful son ever approved himself the humble and faithful minister of so indulgent a father  Sueton in Tit c Plin in Praefat Hist Natur    The good sense of Vespasian engaged him indeed  The race of the Caesars and the Flavian family  to embrace every measure that might confirm his recent and precarious elevation The military oath and the fidelity of the troops had been consecrated by the habits of an hundred years to the name and family of the Caesars and although that family had been continued only by the fictitious rite of adoption the Romans still revered in the person of Nero the grandson of Germanicus and the lineal successor of Augustus It was not without reluctance and remorse that the Praetorian guards had been  persuaded to abandon the cause of the tyrant  This idea is frequently and strongly inculcated by Tacitus See Hist i ii  The rapid downfal of Galba Otho and Vitellius taught the armies to consider the emperors as the creatures of  their  will and the instruments of  their  licence The birth of Vespasian was mean his grandfather had been a private soldier his father a petty officer of the revenue  The emperor Vespasian with his usual good sense laughed at the Genealogists who deduced his family from Flavius the founder of Reate his native country and one of the companions of Hercules Suet in Vespasian c  his own merit had raised him in an advanced age to the empire but his merit was rather useful than shining and his virtues were disgraced by a strict and even forbid parsimony Such a prince consulted his true interest by the association of a son whose more splendid and amiable character might turn the public attention from the obscure origin to the future glories of the Flavian house Under the mild administration of Titus the Roman world enjoyed a transient felicity and his beloved memory served to protect above fifteen years the vices of his brother Domitian  Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from  A D  the assassins of Domitian before he discovered  Adoption and character of Trajan  that his feeble age was unable to stem the torrent of public disorders which had multiplied under the long tyranny of his predecessor His mild disposition was respected by the good but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous character whose justice should strike terror

immediately by a decree of the senate declared him his colleague and successor in the empire  Dion l lxviii p Plin Secund in Panegyric  It is sincerely to be lamented that  A D  whilst we are fatigued with the disgustful relation of Nero's crimes and follies we are reduced to collect the actions of Trajan from the glimmerings of an abridgment or the doubtful light of a panegyric There remains however one panegyric far removed beyond the suspicion of flattery Above two hundred and fifty years after the death of Trajan the senate in pouring out the customary acclamations on the accession of a new emperor wished that he might surpass the felicity of Augustus and the virtue of Trajan  Felicior Augusto MELIOR TRAJANO Eutrop viii    We may readily believe that the father of his  A D  country hesitated whether he ought to intrust the  Of Hadrian  various and doubtful character of his kinsman Hadrian with sovereign power In his last moments the arts of the empress Plotina either fixed the irresolution of Trajan or boldly supposed a fictitious adoption  Dion l lxix p affirms the whole to have been a fiction on the authority of his father who being governor of the province where Trajan died had very good opportunities of sifting this mysterious transaction Yet Dodwell Praelect Camden xvii has maintained that Hadrian was called to the certain hope of the empire during the lifetime of Trajan  the truth of which could not be safely disputed and Hadrian was  peaceably acknowledged as his lawful successor Under his reign as has been already mentioned the empire flourished in peace and prosperity He encouraged the arts reformed the laws asserted military discipline and visited all his provinces in person His vast and active genius was equally suited to the most enlarged views and the minute details of civil policy But the ruling passions of his soul were curiosity and vanity As they prevailed and as they were attracted by different objects Hadrian was by turns an excellent prince a ridiculous sophist and a jealous tyrant The general tenor of his conduct deserved praise for its equity and moderation Yet in the first days of his reign he put to death four consular senators his personal enemies and men who had been judged worthy of empire and the tediousness of a painful illness rendered him at last peevish and cruel The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a god or a tyrant and the honours decreed to his memory were granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus  Dion l lxx p Aurel Victor    The caprice of Hadrian influenced his choice  Adoption of the elder and younger Verus  of a successor After revolving in his mind several men of distinguished merit whom he esteemed and hated he adopted Aelius Verus a gay and voluptuous nobleman recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover of Antinous  The deification of Antinous his medals statues temples city oracles and constellation are well known and still dishonour the memory of Hadrian Yet we may remark that of the first fifteen emperors Claudius was the only one whose taste in love was entirely correct For the honours of Antinous see Spanheim Commentaire sur les Caesars de Julien p    But while Hadrian was delighting himself with his own applause and the acclamations of the soldiers whose consent had been secured by an immense donative the new Caesar  Hist August p Aurelius Victor in Epitom  was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death He left only one son Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the Antonines He was adopted by Pius and on the accession of Marcus was invested with an equal share of sovereign power Among the many vices of this younger Verus he possessed one virtue a dutiful reverence for his wiser colleague to whom he willingly abandoned the ruder cares of empire The philosophic emperor dissembled his follies lamented his early death and cast a decent veil over his memory  As soon as Hadrian's passion was either gratified  Adoption of the two Antonines  or disappointed he resolved to deserve the thanks of posterity by placing the most exalted merit on the Roman throne His discerning eye easily discovered a senator about fifty years of age blameless in all the offices of life and a youth of about seventeen whose riper years opened the fair prospect of every virtue the elder of these was declared the son and successor of Hadrian on condition however that he himself should immediately adopt the younger The two Antonines for it is of them that we are now speaking governed the Roman world fortytwo  A D  years with the same

twentythree years of Pius's reign Marcus was only two nights absent from the palace and even those were at different times Hist August p  and after he was no more regulated his own administration by the example and maxims of his predecessor Their united reigns are possibly the only period of history in which the happiness of a great people was the sole object of government  Titus Antoninus Pius has been justly denominated  Character and reign of Pius  a second Numa The same love of religion justice and peace was the distinguishing characteristic of both princes But the situation of the latter opened a much larger field for the exercise of those virtues Numa could only prevent a few neighbouring villages from plundering each other's harvests Antoninus diffused order and tranquillity over the greatest part of the earth His reign is marked by the rare advantage of furnishing very few materials for history which is indeed little more than the  register of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind In private life he was an amiable as well as a good man The native simplicity of his virtue was a stranger to vanity or affectation He enjoyed with moderation the conveniencies of his fortune and the innocent pleasures of society  He was fond of the theatre and not insensible to the charms of the fair sex Marcus Antoninus i Hist August p Julian in Caesar  and the benevolence of his soul displayed itself in a cheerful serenity of temper  The virtue of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was  Of Marcus  of a severer and more laborious kind  The enemies of Marcus charged him with hypocrisy and with a want of that simplicity which distinguished Pius and even Verus Hist August This suspicion unjust as it was may serve to account for the superior applause bestowed upon personal qualifications in preference to the social virtues Even Marcus Antoninus has been called a hypocrite but the wildest scepticism never insinuated that Caesar might possibly be a coward or Tully a fool Wit and valour are qualifications more easily ascertained than humanity or the love of justice  It was the wellearned harvest of many a learned conference of many a patient lecture and many a midnight lucubration At the age of twelve years he embraced the rigid system of the Stoicks which taught him to submit his body to his mind his passions to his reason to consider virtue as the only good vice as the only evil all things external as things indifferent  Tacitus has characterized in a few words the principles of the portico Doctores sapientiae secutus est qui sola bona quae honesta mala tantum quae turpia potentiam nobilitatem caeteraque extra animum neque bonis neque malis adnumerant Tacit Hist iv  His  meditations composed in the tumult of a camp are still extant and he even condescended to give lessons of philosophy in a more public manner than was perhaps consistent with the modesty of a sage or the dignity of an emperor  Before he went on the second expedition against the Germans he read lectures of philosophy to the Roman people during three days He had already done the same in the cities of Greece and Asia Hist August in Cassio c  But his life was the noblest commentary on the precepts of Zeno He was severe to himself indulgent to the imperfection of others just and beneficent to all mankind He regretted that Avidius Cassius who excited a rebellion in Syria had disappointed him by a voluntary death of the pleasure of converting an enemy into a friend and he justified the sincerity of that sentiment by moderating the zeal of the senate against the adherents of the traitor  Dion l lxxi p Hist August in Avid Cassio  War he detested as the disgrace and calamity of human nature but when the necessity of a just defence called upon him to take up arms he readily exposed his person to eight winter campaigns on the frozen banks of the Danube the severity of which was at last fatal to the weakness of his constitution His memory was revered by a grateful posterity and above a century after his death many persons preserved the image of Marcus Antoninus among those of their household gods  Hist August in Marc Antonin c    If a man were called to fix the period in the  Happiness of the Romans  history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperrous  he would without hesitation name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus The vast extent of the Roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four successive emperors whose characters and authority commanded involuntary respect The forms of the civil administration were carefully preserved by Nerva Trajan Hadrian and the Antonines who delighted in the image of liberty and were pleased with considering themselves as the accountable ministers of the laws Such princes deserved the honour of restoring the republic had the Romans of their days been capable of enjoying a rational freedom  The labours of these monarchs were overpaid  Its precarious nature  by the immense reward that inseparably waited on their success by the honest pride of virtue and by the exquisite delight of beholding the general happiness of which they were the authors A just but melancholy reflection embittered however the noblest of human enjoyments They must often have recollected the instability of a happiness which depended on the character of a single man The fatal moment was perhaps approaching when some licentious youth or some jealous tyrant would abuse to the destruction that absolute power which they had exerted for the benefit of their people The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws might serve  to display the virtues but could never correct the vices of the emperor The military force was a blind and irresistible instrument of oppression and the corruption of Roman manners would always supply flatteres

of modern history In the conduct of those monarchs we may trace the utmost lines of vice and virtue the most exalted perfection and the meanest degeneracy of our own species The golden age of Trajan and the Antonines had been preceded by an age of iron It is almost superfluous to enumerate the unworthy successors of Augustus Their unparalleled vices and the splendid theatre on which they were

The minds of the Romans were very differently  Knowledge and free spirit of the Romans  prepared for slavery Oppressed beneath the weight of their own corruption and of military violence they for a long while preserved the  sentiments or at least the ideas of their freeborn ancestors The education of Helvidius and Thrasea of Tacitus and Pliny was the same as that of Cato and Cicero From Grecian philosophy they had imbibed the justest and most liberal notions of the dignity of human nature and the origin of civil society The history of their own country had taught them to revere a free a virtuous and a victorious commonwealth to abhor the successful crimes of Caesar and Augustus and inwardly to despise those tyrants whom they adored with the most abject flattery As magistrates and senators they were admitted into the great council which had once dictated laws to the earth whose name still gave a sanction to the acts of the monarch and whose authority was so often prostituted to the vilest purposes of tyranny Tiberius and those emperors who adopted his maxims attempted to disguise their murders by the formalities of justice and perhaps enjoyed a secret pleasure in rendering the senate their accomplice as well as their victim By this assembly the last of the Romans were condemned for imaginary crimes and real virtues Their infamous accusers assumed the language of independent patriots who arraigned a dangerous citizen before the tribunal of his country and the public service was rewarded by riches and honours  They alleged the example of Scipio and Cato Tacit

husband He promoted several of her lovers to posts of honour and profit  Hist August p  and during a connexion of thirty years invariably gave her proofs of the most tender confidence and of a respect

should pay their vows before the altar of their chaste patroness  Dion Cassius l lxxi p Hist August p Commentaire de Spanheim sur les Cesars de Julien p The deification of Faustina is the only defect which Julian's criticism is able to discover in the allaccomplished character of Marcus    The monstrous vices of the son have cast a shade on the purity of the father's virtues It has been objected to Marcus that he sacrificed  to his son Commodus  the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a worthless boy and that he chose a successor in his own family rather than in the republic Nothing however was neglected by the anxious father and by the men of virtue and learning whom he summoned to his assistance to expand the narrow mind of young Commodus to correct his growing vices and to render him worthy of the throne for which he was designed But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous The distasteful lesson of a grave philosopher was in a moment obliterated by the whisper of a profligate favourite and Marcus himself blasted the fruits of this laboured education by admitting his son at the age of fourteen or fifteen to a full participation of the Imperial power He lived but four years afterwards but he lived long enough to repent a rash measure which raised the impetuous youth above the restraint of reason and authority  Most of the crimes which disturb the internal  Accession of the emperor Commodus  peace of society are produced by the restraints which the necessary but unequal laws of property have imposed on the appetites of mankind by confining to a few the possession of those objects that are coveted by many Of all our passions and appetites the love of power is of the most imperious and unsociable nature since the pride of one man requires the submission of  the multitude In the tumult of civil discord the laws of society lose their force and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity The ardor of contention the pride of victory the despair of success the memory of past injuries and the fear of future dangers all contribute to inflame the mind and to silence the voice of pity From such motives almost every page of history has been stained with civil blood but these motives will not account for the unprovoked cruelties of Commodus who had nothing to wish and every thing to enjoy The beloved son of Marcus succeeded to his father amidst  A D  the acclamations of the senate and armies  Commodus was the first  Porphyrogenetus  born since his

and when he ascended the throne the happy youth saw round him neither competitor to remove nor enemies to punish In this calm elevated station it was surely natural that he should prefer the love of mankind to their detestation the mild glories of his five predecessors to the ignominious fate of Nero and Domitian  Yet Commodus was not as he has been represented  Character of Commodus  a tiger

and timidity rendered him the slave of his attendants who gradually corrupted his  mind His cruelty which at first obeyed the dictates of others degenerated into habit and at length became the ruling passion of his soul  Dion Cassius l lxxii p    Upon the death of his father Commodus  He returns to Rome  found himself embarrassed with the command of a great army and the conduct of a difficult war against the Quadi and Marcomanni  According to Tertullian Apolog c he died at Sirmium But the situation of Vindobona or Vienna where both the Victors place his death is better adapted to the operations of the war against the Marcomanni and Quadi  The servile and profligate youths whom Marcus had banished soon regained their station and influence about the new emperor They exaggerated the hardships and dangers of a campaign in the wild countries beyond the Danube and they assured the indolent prince that the terror of his name and the arms of his lieutenants would be sufficient to complete the conquest of the dismayed barbarians or to impose such conditions as were more advantageous than any conquest By a dextrous application to his sensual appetites they compared the tranquillity the splendour the refined pleasures of Rome with the tumult of a Pannonian camp which afforded neither leisure nor materials for luxury  Herodian l i p  Commodus listened to the pleasing advice but whilst he hesitated between his own inclination and the awe which he still retained for his father's counsellors the summer insensibly elapsed and his triumphal entry into the capital was deferred till the autumn His graceful person  Herodian l i p  popular address and imagined  virtues attracted the public favour the honourable peace which he had recently granted to the barbarians diffused an universal joy  This universal joy is well described from the medals as well as historians by Mr Wotton Hist of Rome p  his impatience to revisit Rome was fondly ascribed to the love of his country and his dissolute course of amusements was faintly condemned in a prince of nineteen years of age  During the three first years of his reign the forms and even the spirit of the old administration were maintained by those faithful counsellors to whom Marcus had recommended his son and for whose wisdom and integrity Commodus still entertained a reluctant esteem The young prince and his profligate favourites revelled in all the licence of sovereign power but his hands were yet unstained with blood and he had even displayed a generosity of sentiment which might perhaps have ripened into solid virtue  Manilius the confidential secretary of Avidius Cassius was discovered after he had lain concealed several years The emperor nobly relieved the public anxiety by refusing to

walls of the palace Lucilla the emperor's sister and widow of Lucius Verus impatient of the second rank and jealous of the reigning empress had armed the murderer against her brother's life She had not ventured to communicate the black design to her second husband Claudius Pompeianus a senator of distinguished merit and unshaken loyalty but among the crowd of her lovers for she imitated the manners of Faustina she found men of desperate fortunes and wild ambition who were prepared to serve her more violent as well as her tender passions The conspirators experienced the rigor of justice and the abandoned princess was punished first with exile and afterwards with death  Dion l lxxii p Herodian l i p Hist August p    But the words of the assassin sunk deep into the  Hatred and cruelty of Commodus towards the senate  mind of Commodus and left an indelible impression of fear and hatred against the whole body of the senate Those whom he had dreaded as importunate ministers he now suspected as secret enemies The Delators a race of men discouraged and almost extinguished under the former reigns again became formidable as soon as they discovered that the emperor was desirous of finding disaffection and treason in the senate That assembly whom Marcus had ever considered as the great council of the nation was composed of the most distinguished of the Romans and distinction of every kind soon became criminal  The possession of wealth stimulated the diligence of the informers rigid virtue implied a tacit censure of the irregularities of Commodus important services implied a dangerous superiority of merit and the friendship of the father always ensured the aversion of the son Suspicion was equivalent to proof Trial to condemnation The execution of a considerable senator was attended with the death of all who might lament or revenge his fate and when Commodus had once tasted human blood he became incapable of pity or remorse  Of these innocent victims of tyranny none  The Quintilian brothers  died more lamented than the two brothers of the Quintilian family Maximus and Condianus whose fraternal love has saved their names from oblivion and endeared their memory to posterity Their studies and their occupations their pursuits and their pleasures were still the same In the enjoyment of a great estate they never admitted the idea of a separate interest some fragments are now extant of a treatise which they composed in common and in every action of life it was observed that their two bodies were animated by one soul The Antonines who valued their virtues and delighted in their union raised them in the same year to the consulship and Marcus afterwards intrusted to their joint care the civil administration of Greece and a great military command in which they obtained a signal victory over the Germans The  kind cruelty of Commodus united them in death  In a note upon the Augustan History Casaubon has collected a number of particulars concerning these celebrated brothers See p of his learned commentary    The tyrant's rage after having shed the noblest  The minister Perennis  blood of the senate at length recoiled on the principal instrument of his cruelty Whilst Commodus was immersed in blood and luxury he devolved the detail of the public business on Perennis a servile and ambitious minister who had obtained his post by the murder of his predecessor but who possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability By acts of extortion and the forfeited estates of the nobles sacrificed to his avarice he had accumulated an immense treasure The Praetorian guards were under his immediate command and his son who already discovered a military genius was at the head of the Illyrian legions Perennis aspired to the empire or what in the eyes of Commodus amounted to the same crime he was capable of aspiring to it had he not been prevented surprised and put to death The fall of a minister  A D  is a very trifling incident in the general history of the empire but it was hastened by an extraordinary circumstance which proved how much the nerves of discipline were already relaxed The legions of Britain discontented with the administration of Perennis formed a deputation of fifteen hundred select men with instructions to march to Rome and lay their complaints before the emperor These military petitioners  by their own determined behaviour by inflaming the divisions of the guards by exaggerating the strength of the British army and by alarming the fears of Commodus exacted and obtained the minister's death as the only redress of their grievances  Dion l lxxii p Herodian l i p Hist August p Dion gives a much less odious character of Perennis than the other historians His moderation is almost a pledge of his veracity  This presumption of a distant army and their discovery of the weakness of government was a sure presage of the most dreadful convulsions  The negligence of the public administration  Revolt of Maternus  was betrayed soon afterwards by a new disorder which arose from the smallest beginnings A spirit of desertion began to prevail among the troops and the deserters instead of seeking their safety in flight or concealment infested the highways Maternus a private soldier of a daring boldness above his station collected these bands of robbers into a little army set open the prisons invited the slaves to assert their freedom and plundered with impunity the rich and defenceless cities of Gaul and Spain The governors of the provinces who had long been the spectators and perhaps the partners of his depredations were at length roused from their supine indolence by the threatening commands of the emperor Maternus found that he was encompassed and foresaw that he must be overpowered A great effort of despair was his last resource He ordered his followers to disperse  to pass the Alps in small parties and various disguises and to assemble at Rome during the licentious tumult of the festival of Cybele  During the second Punic war the Romans imported from Asia the worship of the mother of the gods Her festival the  Megalesia  began on the fourth of April and lasted six days The streets were crowded with mad processions the theatres with spectators and the public tables with unbidden guests Order and police were suspended and pleasure was the only serious business of the city See Ovid de Fastis l iv c  To murder Commodus and to ascend the vacant throne was the ambition of no vulgar robber His measures were so ably concerted that his concealed troops already filled the streets of Rome The envy of an accomplice discovered and ruined this singular enterprise in the moment when it was ripe for execution  Herodian l i p    Suspicious princes often promote the last of  The minister Cleander  mankind from a vain persuasion that those who have no dependence except on their favour will have no attachment except to the person of their benefactor Cleander the successor of Perennis was a Phrygian by birth of a nation over whose stubborn but servile temper blows only could prevail  Cicero pro Flacco c  He had been sent from his native country to Rome in the capacity of a slave As a slave he entered the Imperial palace rendered himself useful to his master's passions and rapidly ascended to the most exalted station which a subject could enjoy His influence over the mind of Commodus was much greater than that of his predecessor for Cleander was devoid of  any ability or virtue which could inspire the emperor with envy or distrust Avarice was the reigning passion of his soul and the great principle  His avarice and cruelty  of his administration The rank of Consul of Patrician of Senator was exposed to public sale and it would have been considered as disaffection if any one had refused to purchase these empty and disgraceful honours with the greatest part of his fortune  One of these dearbought promotions occasioned a current bon mot that Julius Solon was  banished  into the senate  In the lucrative provincial employments the minister shared with the governor the spoils of the people The execution of the laws was venal and arbitrary A wealthy criminal might obtain not only the reversal of the sentence by which he was justly condemned but might likewise inflict whatever punishment he pleased on the accuser the witnesses and the judge  By these means Cleander in the space of three years had accumulated more wealth than had ever yet been possessed by any freedman  Dion l lxxii p observes that no freedman had possessed riches equal to those of Cleander The fortune of Pallas amounted however to upwards of five and twenty hundred thousand pounds  Ter millies  Commodus was perfectly satisfied with the magnificent presents which the artful courtier laid at his feet in the most seasonable moments To divert the public envy Cleander under the emperor's name erected baths porticos and places of exercise for the use of the people  Dion l lxxii p Herodian l i p Hist August p These baths were situated near the  Porta Capena  See Nardini Roma Antica p  He  flattered himself that the Romans dazzled and amused by this apparent liberality would be less affected by the bloody scenes which were daily exhibited that they would forget the death of Byrrhus a senator to whose superior merit the late emperor had granted one of his daughters and that they would forgive the execution of Arrius Antoninus the last representative of the name and virtues of the Antonines The former with more integrity than prudence had attempted to disclose to his brotherinlaw the true character of Cleander An equitable sentence pronounced by the latter when Proconsul of Asia against a worthless creature of the favourite proved fatal to him  Hist August p  After the fall of Perennis the terrors of Commodus had for a short time assumed the appearance of a return to virtue He repealed the most odious of his acts loaded his memory with the public execration and ascribed to the pernicious counsels of that wicked minister all the errors of his inexperienced youth But his repentance lasted only thirty days and under Cleander's tyranny the administration of Perennis was often regretted  Pestilence and famine contributed to fill up the  Sedition and death of Cleander  measure of the calamities of Rome  Herodian l i p Dion l lxxii p The

people quitted their favourite amusements for the more delicious pleasure of revenge rushed in crowds towards a palace in the suburbs one of the emperor's retirements and demanded with angry clamours the head of the public enemy Cleander who commanded the Praetorian guards  Tuncque primum tres praefecti praetorio fuere inter quos libertinus From some remains of modesty Cleander declined the title

the defence of his master's person Salmasius and Casaubon seem to have talked very idly upon this passage  ordered a body of cavalry to sally forth and disperse the seditious multitude The multitude fled with precipitation towards the city several were slain and many more were trampled to death but when the cavalry entered the streets their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and darts from the roofs and windows of the houses The foot guards  Herodian l i p It is doubtful whether he means the Praetorian infantry or the cohortes urbanae a body of six thousand men but whose rank and discipline were not equal to their numbers Neither Tillemont nor Wotton chuse to decide this question  who had been long jealous of the prerogatives and insolence of the Praetorian cavalry embraced the party of the people The tumult became a regular engagement and threatened a general massacre The Praetorians at length gave way oppressed with numbers and the tide of popular fury returned  with redoubled violence against the gates of the palace where Commodus lay dissolved in luxury and alone unconscious of the civil war It was death to approach his person with the unwelcome news He would have perished in this supine security had not two women his elder sister Fadilla and Marcia the most favoured of his concubines ventured to break into his presence Bathed in tears and with dishevelled hair they threw themselves at his feet and with all the pressing eloquence of fear discovered to the affrighted emperor the crimes of the minister the rage of the people and the impending ruin which in a few minutes would burst over his palace and person Commodus started from his dream of pleasure and commanded that the head of Cleander should be thrown out to the people The desired spectacle instantly appeased the tumult and the son of Marcus might even yet have regained the affection and confidence of his subjects  Dion Cassius l lxxii p Herodian l i p Hist August p    But every sentiment of virtue and humanity  Dissolute pleasures of Commodus  was extinct in the mind of Commodus Whilst he thus abandoned the reins of empire to these unworthy favourites he valued nothing in sovereign power except the unbounded licence of indulging his sensual appetites His hours were spent in a seraglio of three hundred beautiful women and as many boys of every rank and of every province and wherever the arts of seduction proved ineffectual the brutal lover had  recourse to violence The ancient historians  Sororibus suis constupratis Ipsas concubinas suas sub oculis suis stuprari jubebat Nec irruentium in se juvenum carebat infamiÃ¢ omni parte corporis atque ore in sexum utrumque pollutus Hist Aug p  have expatiated on these abandoned scenes of prostitution which scorned every restraint of nature or modesty but it would not be easy to translate their too faithful descriptions into the decency of modern language The intervals of lust were filled up with the basest amusements The influence of a polite age and the labour of  His ignorance and low sports  an attentive education had never been able to infuse into his rude and brutish mind the least tincture of learning and he was the first of the Roman emperors totally devoid of taste for the pleasures of the understanding Nero himself excelled or affected to excel in the elegant arts of music and poetry nor should we despise his pursuits had he not converted the pleasing relaxation of a leisure hour into the serious business and ambition of his life But Commodus from his earliest infancy discovered an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal and a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace the sports of the circus and amphitheatre the combats of gladiators and the hunting of wild beasts The masters in every branch of learning whom Marcus provided for his son were heard with inattention and disgust whilst the Moors and Parthians who taught him to dart the javelin and to shoot with the bow found a disciple who delighted in his application and soon equalled  the most skilful of his instructors in the steadiness of the eye and the dexterity of the hand  The servile crowd whose fortune depended on  Hunting of wild beasts  their master's vices applauded these ignoble pursuits The perfidious voice of flattery reminded him that by exploits of the same nature by the defeat of the Nemaean lion and the slaughter of the wild boar of Erymanthus the Grecian Hercules had acquired a place among the gods and an immortal memory among men They only forgot to observe that in the first ages of society when the fiercer animals often dispute with man the possession of an unsettled country a successful war against those savages is one of the most innocent and beneficial labours of heroism In the civilized state of the Roman empire the wild beasts had long since retired from the face of man and the neighbourhood of populous cities To surprise them in their solitary haunts and to transport them to Rome that they might be slain in pomp by the hand of an emperor was an enterprise equally ridiculous for the prince and oppressive for the people  The African lions when pressed by hunger infested the open villages and cultivated country and they infested them with impunity The royal beast was reserved for the pleasures of the emperor and the capital and the unfortunate peasant who killed one of them though in his own defence incurred a very heavy penalty This extraordinary  gamelaw  was mitigated by Honorius and finally repealed by Justinian Codex Theodos tom v p et Comment Gothofred  Ignorant of these distinctions Commodus eagerly embraced the glorious resemblance and stiled himself as we  still read on his medals  Spanheim de Numismat Dissertat xii tom ii p  the  Roman Hercules  The club and the lion's hide were placed by the side of the throne amongst the ensigns of sovereignty and statues were erected in which Commodus was represented in the character and with the attributes of the god whose valour and dexterity he endeavoured to emulate in the daily course of his ferocious amusements  Dion l lxxii p Hist August p    Elated with these praises which gradually  Commodus displays his skill in the amphitheatre  extinguished the innate sense of shame Commodus resolved to exhibit before the eyes of the Roman people those exercises which till then he had decently confined within the walls of his palace and to the presence of a few favourites On the appointed day the various motives of flattery fear and curiosity attracted to the amphitheatre an innumerable multitude of spectators and some degree of applause was deservedly bestowed on the uncommon skill of the Imperial performer Whether he aimed at the head or heart of the animal the wound was alike certain and mortal With arrows whose point was shaped into the form of a crescent Commodus often intercepted the rapid career and cut asunder the long bony neck of the ostrich  The ostrich's neck is three feet long and composed of seventeen vertebrae See Buffon Hist Naturelle  A panther was let loose and the archer waited till he had leaped upon a trembling malefactor In the same instant the shaft flew the beast dropt dead and the man remained unhurt The dens of the  amphitheatre disgorged at once a hundred lions a hundred darts from the unerring hand of Commodus laid them dead as they ran raging round the  Arena  Neither the huge bulk of the elephant nor the scaly hide of the rhinoceros could defend them from his stroke Aethiopia and India yielded their most extraordinary productions and several animals were slain in the amphitheatre which had been seen only in the representations of art or perhaps of fancy  Commodus killed a camelopardalis or Giraffe Dion l lxxii p the tallest the most gentle and the most useless of the large quadrupeds This singular animal a native only of the interior parts of Africa has not been seen in Europe since the revival of letters and though M de Buffon Hist Naturelle tom xiii has endeavoured to describe he has not ventured to delineate the Giraffe  In all these exhibitions the securest precautions were used to protect the person of the Roman Hercules from the desperate spring of any savage who might possibly disregard the dignity of the emperor and the sanctity of the god  Herodian l i p Hist August p    But the meanest of the populace were affected  Acts as a gladiator  with shame and indignation when they beheld their sovereign enter the lists as a gladiator and glory in a profession which the laws and manners of the Romans had branded with the justest note of infamy  The virtuous and even the wise princes forbade the senators and knights to embrace this scandalous profession under pain of infamy or what was more dreaded by those profligate wretches of exile The tyrants allured them to dishonour by threats and rewards Nero once produced in the Arena forty senators and sixty knights See Lipsius Saturnalia l ii c He has happily corrected a passage of Suetonius in Nerone c  He chose the habit and arms of  the  Secutor  whose combat with the  Retiarius  formed one of the most lively scenes in the bloody sports of the amphitheatre The  Secutor  was armed with an helmet sword and buckler his naked antagonist had only a large net and a trident with the one he endeavoured to entangle with the other to dispatch his enemy If he missed the first throw he was obliged to fly from the pursuit of the  Secutor  till he had prepared his net for a second cast  Lipsius l ii c Juvenal in the eighth satire gives a picturesque description of this combat  The emperor fought in this character seven hundred and thirtyfive several times These glorious atchievements were carefully recorded in the public acts of the empire and that he might omit no circumstance of infamy he received from the common fund of gladiators a stipend so exorbitant that it became a new and most ignominious tax upon the Roman people  Hist August p Dion l lxxii p He received for each time  decies  about l sterling  It may be easily supposed that in these engagements the master of the world was always successful in the amphitheatre his victories were not often sanguinary but when he exercised his skill in the school of gladiators or his own palace his wretched antagonists were frequently honoured with a mortal wound from the hand of Commodus and obliged to seal their flattery with their blood  Victor tells us that Commodus only allowed his antagonists a leaden weapon dreading most probably the consequences of their despair  He now disdained  His infamy and extravagance  the appellation of Hercules The name of Paulus a celebrated Secutor was the only one which  delighted his ear It was inscribed on his colossal statues and repeated in the redoubled acclamations  They were obliged to repeat six hundred and twentysix times  Paulus first of the Secutors  c  of the mournful and applauding senate  Dion l lxxii p He speaks of his own baseness and danger  Claudius Pompeianus the virtuous husband of Lucilla was the only senator who asserted the honour of his rank As a father he permitted his sons to consult their safety by attending the amphitheatre As a Roman he declared that his own life was in the emperor's hands but that he would never behold the son of Marcus prostituting his person and dignity Notwithstanding his manly resolution Pompeianus escaped the resentment of the tyrant and with his honour had the good fortune to preserve his life  He mixed however some prudence with his courage and passed the greatest part of his time in a country retirement alleging his advanced age and the weakness of his eyes  I never saw him in the senate says Dion except during the short reign of Pertinax  All his infirmities had suddenly left him and they returned as suddenly upon the murder of that excellent prince Dion l lxxiii p    Commodus had now attained the summit of vice and infamy Amidst the acclamations of a flattering court he was unable to disguise from himself that he had deserved the contempt and hatred of every man of sense and virtue in his empire His ferocious spirit was irritated by the consciousness of that hatred by the envy of every kind of merit by the just apprehension of danger and by the habit of slaughter which he contracted in his daily amusements History  has preserved a long list of consular senators sacrificed to his wanton suspicion which sought out with peculiar anxiety those unfortunate persons  Conspiracy of his domestics  connected however remotely with the family of the Antonines without sparing even the ministers of his crimes or pleasures  The praefects were changed almost hourly or daily and the caprice of Commodus was often fatal to his most favourite chamberlains Hist August p  His cruelty proved at last fatal to himself He had shed with impunity the noblest blood of Rome he perished as soon as he was dreaded by his own domestics Marcia his favourite concubine Eclectus his chamberlain and Laetus his Praetorian praefect alarmed by the fate of their companions and predecessors resolved to prevent the destruction which every hour hung

with hunting some wild beasts Commodus retired to sleep but whilst he was labouring with the  Death of Commodus  effects of poison and drunkenness a robust youth  A D st December  by profession a wrestler entered his chamber and strangled him without resistance The body was secretly conveyed out of the palace before the least suspicion was entertained in the city or even in the court of the emperor's death Such was the fate of the son of Marcus and so easy was it to destroy a hated tyrant who by the artificial powers of government had oppressed during thirteen years so many millions of subjects  each of whom was equal to their master in personal strength and personal abilities  Dion l lxxii p Herodian l i p Hist August p    The measures of the conspirators were conducted  Choice of Pertinax for emperor  with the deliberate coolness and celerity which the greatness of the occasion required They resolved instantly to fill the vacant throne with an emperor whose character would justify and maintain the action that had been committed They fixed on Pertinax praefect of the city an ancient senator of consular rank whose conspicuous merit had broke through the obscurity of his birth and raised him to the first honours of the state He had successively governed most of the provinces of the empire and in all his great employments military as well as civil he had uniformly distinguished himself by the firmness the prudence and the integrity of his conduct  Pertinax was a native of Alba Pompeia in Piedmont and son of a timbermerchant The order of his employments it is marked by Capitolinus well deserves to be set down as expressive of the form of government and manners of the age He was a centurion Praefect of a cohort in Syria in the Parthian war and in Britain He obtained an  Ala  or squadron of horse in Maesia He was commissary of provisions on the Aemilian way He commanded the fleet upon the Rhine He was procurator of Dacia with a salary of about l a year He commanded the Veterans of a legion He obtained the rank of senator Of praetor With the command of the first legion in Rhaetia and Noricum He was consul about the year He attended Marcus into the east He commanded an army on the Danube He was consular legate of Maesia Of Dacia Of Syria Of Britain He had the care of the public provisions at Rome He was proconsul of Africa Praefect of the city Herodian l i p does justice to his disinterested spirit but Capitolinus who collected every popular rumour charges him with a great fortune acquired by bribery and corruption  He now remained almost alone of  the friends and ministers of Marcus and when at a late hour of the night he was awakened with the news that the chamberlain and the praefect were at his door he received them with intrepid resignation and desired they would execute their master's orders Instead of death they offered him the throne of the Roman world During some moments he distrusted their intentions and assurances Convinced at length of the death of Commodus he accepted the purple with a sincere reluctance the natural effect of his knowledge both of the duties and of the dangers of the supreme rank  Julian in the Caesars taxes him with being accessary to the death of Commodus    Laetus conducted without delay his new emperor  He is acknowledgeed by the Praetorian guards  to the camp of the Praetorians diffusing at the same time through the city a seasonable report that Commodus died suddenly of an apoplexty and that the virtuous Pertinax had  already  succeeded to the throne The guards were rather surprised than pleased with the suspicious death of a prince whose indulgence and liberality they alone had experienced but the emergency of the occasion the authority of their praefect the reputation of Pertinax and the clamours of the people obliged them to stifle their secret discontents to accept the donative promised of the new emperor to swear allegiance to him and with joyful acclamations and laurels in their hands to  conduct him to the senatehouse that the military consent might be ratified by the civil authority  This important night was now far spent with  and by the senate  the dawn of day and the commencement of the  A D st January  new year the senators expected a summons to attend an ignominious ceremony In spite of all remonstrances even of those of his creatures who yet preserved any regard for prudence or decency Commodus had resolved to pass the night in the gladiator's school and from thence to take possession of the consulship in the habit and with the attendance of that infamous crew On a sudden before the break of day the senate was called together in the temple of Concord to meet the guards and to ratify the election of a new emperor For a few minutes they sat in silent suspence doubtful of their unexpected deliverance and suspicious of the cruel artifices of Commodus but when at length they were assured that the tyrant was no more they resigned themselves to all the transports of joy and indignation Pertinax who modestly represented the meanness of his extraction and pointed out several noble senators more deserving than himself of the empire was constrained by their dutiful violence to ascend the throne and received all the titles of Imperial power confirmed by the most sincere vows of fidelity The memory of Commodus  The memory of Commodus declared infamous  was branded with eternal infamy The names of tyrant of gladiator of public enemy resounded in every corner of the house They decreed in tumultuous votes that his honours  should be reversed his titles erased from the public monuments his statues thrown down his body dragged with a hook into the strippingroom of the gladiators to satiate the public fury and they expressed some indignation against those officious servants who had already presumed to screen his remains from the justice of the senate But Pertinax could not refuse those last rites to the memory of Marcus and the tears of his first protector Claudius Pompeianus who lamented the cruel fate of his brotherinlaw and lamented still more that he had deserved it  Capitolinus gives us the particulars of these tumultuary votes which were moved by one senator and repeated or rather chanted by the whole body Hist August p    These effusions of impotent rage against a dead  Legal jurisdiction of the senate over the emperors  emperor whom the senate had flattered when alive with the most abject servility betrayed a just but ungenerous spirit of revenge The legality of these decrees was however supported by the principles of the Imperial constitution To censure to depose or to punish with death the first magistrate of the republic who had abused his delegated trust was the ancient and undoubted prerogative of the Roman senate  The senate condemned Nero to be put to death  more majorum  Sueton c  but that feeble assembly was obliged to content itself with inflicting on a fallen tyrant that public justice from which during his life and reign he had been shielded by the strong arm of military despotism  Pertinax found a nobler way of condemning his predecessor's memory by the contrast of his own virtues with the vices of Commodus On  Virtues of Pertinax  the day of his accession he resigned over to his wife and son his whole private fortune that they might have no pretence to solicit favours at the expence of the state He refused to flatter the vanity of the former with the title of Augusta or to corrupt the inexperienced youth of the latter by the rank of Caesar Accurately distinguishing between the duties of a parent and those of a sovereign he educated his son with a severe simplicity which while it gave him no assured prospect of the throne might in time have rendered him worthy of it In public the behaviour of Pertinax was grave and affable He lived with the virtuous part of the senate and in a private station he had been acquainted with the true character of each individual without either pride or jealousy considered them as friends and companions with whom he had shared the dangers of the tyranny and with whom he wished to enjoy the security of the present time He very frequently invited them to familiar entertainments the frugality of which was ridiculed by those who remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of Commodus  Dion l lxxiii p speaks of these entertainments as a senator who had supped with the emperor Capitolinus Hist August p like a slave who had received his intelligence from one of the scullions    To heal as far as it was possible the wounds inflicted by the hand of tyranny was the pleasing but melancholy task of Pertinax The  He endeavours to reform the state  innocent victims who yet survived were recalled from exile released from prison and restored to the full possession of their honours and fortunes The unburied bodies of murdered senators for the cruelty of Commodus endeavoured to extend itself beyond death were deposited in the sepulchres of their ancestors their memory was justified and every consolation was bestowed on their ruined and afflicted families Among these consolations one of the most grateful was the punishment of the Delators the common enemies of their master of virtue and of their country Yet even in the inquisition of these legal assassins Pertinax proceeded with a steady temper which gave every thing to justice and nothing to popular prejudice and resentment  The finances of the state demanded the most  His regulations  vigilant care of the emperor Though every measure of injustice and extortion had been adopted which could collect the property of the subject into the coffers of the prince the rapaciousness of Commodus had been so very inadequate to his extravagance that upon his death no more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted treasury  Decies  The blameless oeconomy of Pius left his successors a treasure of  vicies septies millies  above two and twenty millions sterling Dion l lxxiii p  to defray the current expences of government and to discharge the pressing demand of a liberal donative which  the new emperor had been obliged to promise to the Praetorian guards Yet under these distressed circumstances Pertinax had the generous firmness to remit all the oppressive taxes invented by Commodus and to cancel all the unjust claims of the treasury declaring in a decree of the senate  that he was better satisfied to administer a poor republic with innocence than to acquire riches by the ways of tyranny and dishonour  Oeconomy and industry he considered as the pure and genuine sources of wealth and from them he soon derived a copious supply for the public necessities The expence of the household was immediately reduced to one half All the instruments of luxury Pertinax exposed to public auction  Besides the design of converting these useless ornaments into money Dion l lxxiii p assigns two secret motives of Pertinax He wished to expose the vices of Commodus and to discover by the purchasers those who most resembled him  gold and silver plate chariots of a singular construction a superfluous wardrobe of silk and embroidery and a great number of beautiful slaves of both sexes excepting only with attentive humanity those who were born in a state of freedom and had been ravished from the arms of their weeping parents At the same time that he obliged the worthless favourites of the tyrant to resign a part of their illgotten wealth he satisfied the just creditors of the state and unexpectedly discharged the long arrears of honest services He removed the oppressive restrictions which had been laid upon commerce and granted all the uncultivated  lands in Italy and the provinces to those who would improve them with an exemption from tribute during the term of ten years  Though Capitolinus has picked up many idle tales of the private life of Pertinax he joins with Dion and Herodian in admiring his public conduct    Such an uniform conduct had already secured  and popularity  to Pertinax the noblest reward of a sovereign the love and esteem of his people Those who remembered the virtues of Marcus were happy to contemplate in their new emperor the features of that bright original and flattered themselves that they should long enjoy the benign influence of his administration A hasty zeal to reform the corrupted state accompanied with less prudence than might have been expected from the years and experience of Pertinax proved fatal to himself and to his country His honest indiscretion united against him the servile crowd who found their private benefit in the public disorders and who preferred the favour of a tyrant to the inexorable equality of the laws  Leges rem surdam inexorabilem esse T Liv ii    Amidst the general joy the sullen and angry  Discontent of the Praetorians  countenance of the Praetorian guards betrayed their inward dissatisfaction They had reluctantly submitted to Pertinax they dreaded the strictness of the ancient discipline which he was preparing to restore and they regretted the licence of the former reign Their discontents were secretly somented by Laetus their praefect who found when it was too late that his new emperor would reward a servant but would not  be ruled by a favourite On the third day of

resolute behaviour Falco was on the point of being justly condemned to death as a public enemy had he not been saved by the earnest and sincere entreaties of the injured emperor who conjured the

ablest politicians that no state without being soon exhausted can maintain above the hundredth part of its members in arms and idleness But although this relative proportion may be uniform the influence of the army over the rest of the society will vary according to the degree of its positive strength The advantages of military science and discipline cannot be exerted unless a proper number of soldiers are united into one body and actuated by one soul With a handful of men such an union would be ineffectual with an unwieldy host it would be impracticable and the powers of the machine would be alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness or the excessive weight of its springs To illustrate this observation we need only reflect that there is no superiority of natural strength artificial weapons or acquired skill which could  enable one man to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his fellowcreatures the tyrant of a single town or a small district would soon discover that an hundred armed followers were a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or citizens but an hundred thousand welldisciplined soldiers will command with despotic sway ten millions of subjects and a body of ten or fifteen thousand guards will strike terror into the most numerous populace that ever crowded the streets of an immense capital  The Praetorian bands whose licentious fury  The Praetorian guards  was the first symptom and cause of the decline of the Roman empire scarcely amounted to the last mentioned number  They were originally nine or ten thousand men for Tacitus and Dion are not agreed upon the subject divided into as many cohorts Vitellius increased them to sixteen thousand and as far as we can learn from inscriptions they never afterwards sunk much below that number See Lipsius de magnitudine RomanÃ¢ i  They derived their institution  Their institution  from Augustus That crafty tyrant sensible that laws might colour but that arms alone could maintain his usurped dominion had gradually formed this powerful body of guards in constant readiness to protect his person to awe the senate and either to prevent or to crush the first motions of rebellion He distinguished these favoured troops by a double pay and superior privileges but as their formidable aspect would at once have alarmed and irritated the Roman people three cohorts only were stationed

to the throne of despotism By thus introducing the Praetorian guards as it were into the palace and the senate the emperors taught them to perceive their own strength and the weakness of the civil government to view the vices of their masters with familiar contempt and to lay aside that reverential awe which distance only and mystery can preserve towards an imaginary power In the luxurious idleness of an opulent city their pride was nourished by the sense of their irresistible weight nor was it possible to conceal from them that the person of the sovereign the authority of the senate the public treasure and the seat of empire were all  in their hands To divert the Praetorian bands from these dangerous reflections the firmest and best established princes were obliged to mix blandishments with commands rewards with punishments to flatter their pride indulge their pleasures connive at their irregularities and to purchase their precarious faith by a liberal donative which since the elevation of Claudius was exacted as a legal claim on the accession of every new emperor  Claudius raised by the soldiers to the empire was the first who gave a donative He gave  quina dena

appointment of an emperor The election of consuls of generals and of magistrates however it had been recently usurped by the senate was the ancient and undoubted right of the Roman people  Cicero de

Sulpicianus the emperor's fatherinlaw and governor of the city who had been sent to the camp on the first alarm of mutiny was endeavouring to calm the fury of the multitude when he was silenced by the clamorous return of the murderers bearing on a lance the head of Pertinax Though history has accustomed us to observe every principle and every passion yielding to the imperious dictates of ambition it is scarcely credible that in these moments of horror Sulpicianus should have aspired to ascend a throne polluted with the  recent blood of so near a relation and so excellent a prince He had already begun to use the only effectual argument and to treat for the Imperial dignity but the more prudent of the Praetorians apprehensive that in this private contract they should not obtain a just price for so valuable a commodity ran out upon the ramparts and with a loud voice proclaimed that the Roman world was to be disposed of to the best bidder by public auction  Dion l lxxiii p Herodian l ii p Hist August p Though the three historians agree that it was in fact an auction Herodian alone affirms that it was proclaimed as such by the soldiers    This infamous offer the most insolent excess  It is purchased by Julian  of military licence diffused an universal grief shame and indignation throughout the city It  A D March th  reached at length the ears of Didius Julianus a wealthy senator who regardless of the public calamities was indulging himself in the luxury of the table  Spartianus softens the most odious parts of the character and elevation of Julian  His wife and his daughter his freedmen and his parasites easily convinced him that he deserved the throne and earnestly conjured him to embrace so fortunate an opportunity The vain old man hastened to the Praetorian camp where Sulpicianus was still in treaty with the guards and began to bid against him from the foot of the rampart The unworthy negociation was transacted by faithful emissaries who passed alternately from one candidate to the other and acquainted each of them with the  offers of his rival Sulpicianus had already promised a donative of five thousand drachms above one hundred and sixty pounds to each soldier when Julian eager for the prize rose at once to the sum of six thousand two hundred and fifty drachms or upwards of two hundred pounds sterling The gates of the camp were instantly thrown open to the purchaser he was declared emperor and received an oath of allegiance from the soldiers who retained humanity enough to stipulate that he should pardon and forget the competition of Sulpicianus  It was now incumbent on the Praetorians to  Julian is acknowledged by the senate  fulfil the conditions of the sale They placed their new sovereign whom they served and despised in the centre of their ranks surrounded him on every side with their shields and conducted him in close order of battle through the deserted streets of the city The senate was commanded to assemble and those who had been the distinguished friends of Pertinax or the personal enemies of Julian found it necessary to affect a more than common share of satisfaction at this happy revolution  Dion Cassius at that time praetor had been a personal enemy to Julian l lxxiii p  After Julian had filled the senatehouse with armed soldiers he expatiated on the freedom of his election his own eminent virtues and his full assurance of the affections of the senate The obsequious assembly congratulated their own and the public felicity engaged their allegiance and conferred on him all the several branches of the Imperial  power  Hist August p We learn from thence one curious circumstance that the new emperor whatever had been his birth was immediately aggregated to the number of Patrician families  From the senate Julian was conducted by the same military procession to take possession of the palace The first objects that struck  Takes possession of the palace  his eyes were the abandoned trunk of Pertinax and the frugal entertainment prepared for his supper The one he viewed with indifference the other with contempt A magnificent feast was prepared by his order and he amused himself till a very late hour with dice and the performances of Pylades a celebrated dancer Yet it was observed that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed and left him to darkness solitude and terrible reflection he passed a sleepless night revolving most probably in his mind his own rash folly the fate of his virtuous predecessor and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire which had not been acquired by merit but purchased by money  Dion l lxxiii p Hist August p I have endeavoured to blend into one consistent story the seeming contradictions of the two writers    He had reason to tremble On the throne of  The public discontent  the world he found himself without a friend and even without an adherent The guards themselves were ashamed of the prince whom their avarice had persuaded them to accept nor was there a citizen who did not consider his elevation with horror as the last insult on the Roman name The nobility whose conspicuous station and ample possessions exacted the strictest caution dissembled their sentiments and met the affected  civility of the emperor with smiles of complacency and professions of duty But the people secure in their numbers and obscurity gave a free vent to their passions The streets and public places of Rome resounded with clamours and imprecations The enraged multitude affronted the person of Julian rejected his liberality and conscious of the impotence of their own resentment they called aloud on the legions of the frontiers to assert the violated majesty of the Roman empire  The public discontent was soon diffused from  The armies of Britain Syria and Pannonia declare against Julian  the centre to the frontiers of the empire The armies of Britain of Syria and of Illyricum lamented the death of Pertinax in whose company or under whose command they had so often fought and conquered They received with surprise with indignation and perhaps with envy the extraordinary intelligence that the Praetorians had disposed of the empire by public auction and they sternly refused to ratify the ignominious bargain Their immediate and unanimous revolt was fatal to Julian but it was fatal at the same time to the public peace as the generals of the respective armies Clodius Albinus Pescennius Niger and Septimius Severus were still more anxious to succeed than to revenge the murdered Pertinax Their forces were exactly balanced Each of them was at the head of three legions  Dion l lxxiii p  with a numerous train of auxiliaries and however different in their  characters they were all soldiers of experience and capacity  Clodius Albinus governor of Britain surpassed  Clodius Albinus in Britain  both his competitors in the nobility of his extraction which he derived from some of the most illustrious names of the old republic  The Posthumian and the Cejonian the former of whom was raised to the consulship in the fifth year after its institution  But the branch from whence he claimed his descent was sunk into mean circumstances and transplanted into a remote province It is difficult to form a just idea of his true character Under the philosophic cloak of austerity he stands accused of concealing most of the vices which degrade human nature  Spartianus in his undigested collections mixes up all the virtues and all the vices that enter into the human composition and bestows them on the same object Such indeed are many of the characters in the Augustan History  But his accusers are those venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus and trampled on the ashes of an unsuccessful rival Virtue or the appearances of virtue recommended Albinus to the confidence and good opinion of Marcus and his preserving with the son the same interest which he had acquired with the father is a proof at least that he was possessed of a very flexible disposition The favour of a tyrant does not always suppose a want of merit in the object of it he may without intending it reward a man of worth and ability or he may find such a man useful to his own service It does not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus either as the minister of his cruelties or even as the associate of his pleasures  He was employed in a distant honourable command when he received a confidential letter from the emperor acquainting him of the treasonable designs of some discontented generals and authorizing him to declare himself the guardian and successor of the throne by assuming the title and ensigns of Caesar  Hist August p  The governor of Britain wisely declined the dangerous honour which would have marked him for the jealousy or involved him in the approaching ruin of Commodus He courted power by nobler or at least by more specious arts On a premature report of the death of the emperor he assembled his troops and in an eloquent discourse deplored the inevitable mischiefs of despotism described the happiness and glory which their ancestors had enjoyed under the consular government and declared his firm resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal authority This popular harangue was answered by the loud acclamations of the British legions and received at Rome with a secret murmur of applause Safe in the possession of this little world and in the command of an army less distinguished indeed for discipline than for numbers and valour  Pertinax who governed Britain a few years before had been left for dead in a mutiny of the soldiers Hist August p Yet they loved and regretted him admirantibus eam virtutem cui irascebantur  Albinus braved the menaces of Commodus maintained towards Pertinax a stately ambiguous reserve and instantly declared against  the usurpation of Julian The convulsions of the capital added new weight to his sentiments or rather to his professions of patriotism A regard to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus and Emperor and he imitated perhaps the example of Galba who on a similar occasion had styled himself the Lieutenant of the senate and people  Sueton in Galb c    Personal merit alone had raised Pescennius  Pescennius Niger in Syria  Niger from an obscure birth and station to the government of Syria a lucrative and important command which in times of civil confusion gave him a near prospect of the throne Yet his parts seem to have been better suited to the second than to the first rank he was an unequal rival though he might have approved himself an excellent lieutenant to Severus who afterwards displayed the greatness of his mind by adopting several useful institutions from a vanquished enemy  Hist August p  In his government Niger acquired the esteem of the soldiers and the love of the provincials His rigid discipline fortified the valour and confirmed the obedience of the former whilst the voluptuous Syrians were less delighted with the mild firmness of his administration than with the affability of his manners and the apparent pleasure with which he attended their frequent and pompous festivals  Herod l ii p The chronicle of John Malala of Antioch shews the zealous attachment of his countrymen to these festivals which at once gratified their superstition and their love of pleasure  As soon as the intelligence  of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached Antioch the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial purple and revenge his death The legions of the eastern frontier embraced his cause the opulent but unarmed provinces from the frontiers of Aethiopia  A king of Thebes in Egypt is mentioned in the Augustan History as an ally and indeed as a personal friend of Niger If Spartianus is not as I strongly suspect mistaken he has brought to light a dynasty of tributary princes totally unknown to history  to the Hadriatic cheerfully submitted to his power and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates congratulated his election and offered him their homage and services The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this sudden tide of fortune he flattered himself that his accession would be undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood and whilst he enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph he neglected to secure the means of victory Instead of entering into an effectual negociation with the powerful armies of the west whose resolution might decide or at least must balance the mighty contest instead of advancing without delay towards Rome and Italy where his presence was impatiently expected  Dion l lxxiii p Herod l ii p A verse in every one's mouth at that time seems to express the general opinion of the three rivals Optimus est  Niger  bonus  Afer

countenance of Roman provincials the hardy features of the natives were still to be discerned Their warlike youth afforded an inexhaustible supply of recruits to the legions stationed on the banks of the Danube and which from a perpetual warfare against the Germans and Sarmatians were deservedly esteemed the best troops in the service  The Pannonian army was at this time commanded  Septimius Severus  by Septimius Severus a native of Africa who in the gradual ascent of private honours had concealed his daring ambition which was  never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of pleasure the apprehension of danger or the feelings of humanity  In the letter to Albinus already mentioned Commodus accuses Severus as one of the ambitious generals who censured his conduct and wished to occupy his place Hist August p  On the first news of the murder of Pertinax he assembled his troops painted in the most lively colours the crime the insolence and the weakness of the Praetorian guards and animated the legions to arms and to revenge He concluded and the peroration was thought extremely eloquent with promising every soldier about four hundred pounds an honourable donative double in value to the infamous bribe with which Julian had purchased the empire  Pannonia was too poor to supply such a sum It was probably promised in the camp and paid at Rome after the victory In fixing the sum I have adopted the conjecture of Casaubon See Hist August p Comment p  The acclamations of  declared emperor by the Pannonian legions  the army immediately saluted Severus

transaction with his usual accuracy Essay on the original contract    The new candidate for empire saw and improved the peculiar advantage of his situation His province extended to the Julian Alps which  gave an easy access into Italy and he remembered the saying of Augustus That a Pannonian army might in ten days appear in sight of Rome  Velleius Paterculus l ii c We must reckon the march from the nearest verge of Pannonia and extend the sight of the city as far as two hundred miles  By a celerity proportioned to the greatness of  Marches into Italy  the occasion he might reasonably hope to revenge Pertinax punish Julian and receive the homage of the senate and people as their lawful emperor before his competitors separated from Italy by an immense tract of sea and land were apprized of his success or even of his election During the whole expedition he scarcely allowed himself any moments for sleep or food marching on foot and in complete armour at the head of his columns he insinuated himself into the confidence and affection of his troops pressed their diligence revived their spirits animated their hopes and was well satisfied to share the hardships of the meanest soldier whilst he kept in view the infinite superiority of his reward  The wretched Julian had expected and thought  Advances towards Rome  himself prepared to dispute the empire with the governor of Syria but in the invincible and rapid approach of the Pannonian legions he saw his inevitable ruin The hasty arrival of every messenger increased his just apprehensions He was successively informed that Severus had passed the Alps that the Italian cities unwilling or unable to oppose his progress had received him with the warmest professions of joy and duty that the  important place of Ravenna had surrendered without resistance and that the Hadriatic fleet was in the hands of the conqueror The enemy was now within two hundred and fifty miles of Rome and every moment diminished the narrow span of life and empire allotted to Julian  He attempted however to prevent or at least  Distress of Julian  to protract his ruin He implored the venal faith of the Praetorians filled the city with unavailing preparations for war drew lines round the suburbs and even strengthened the fortifications of the palace as if those last intrenchments could be defended without hope of relief against a victorious invader Fear and shame prevented the guards from deserting his standard but they trembled at the name of the Pannonian legions commanded by an experienced general and accustomed to vanquish the barbarians on the frozen Danube  This is not a puerile figure of rhetoric but an allusion to a real fact recorded by Dion l lxxi p It probably happened more than once  They quitted with a sigh the pleasures of the baths and theatres to put on arms whose use they had almost forgotten and beneath the weight of which they were oppressed The unpractised elephants whose uncouth appearance it was hoped would strike terror into the army of the north threw their unskilful riders and the awkward evolutions of the marines drawn from the fleet of Misenum were an object of ridicule to the populace whilst the senate enjoyed  with secret pleasure the distress and weakness of the usurper  Dion l lxxiii p Herodian l ii p There is no surer proof of the military skill of the Romans than their first surmounting the idle terror and afterwards disdaining the dangerous use of elephants in war    Every motion of Julian betrayed his trembling  His uncertain conduct  perplexity He insisted that Severus should be declared a public enemy by the senate He intreated that the Pannonian general might be associated to the empire He sent public ambassadors of consular rank to negociate with his rival he dispatched private assassins to take away his life He designed that the Vestal virgins and all the colleges of priests in their sacerdotal habits and bearing before them the sacred pledges of the Roman religion should advance in solemn procession to meet the Pannonian legions and at the same time he vainly tried to interrogate or to appease the fates by magic ceremonies and unlawful sacrifices  Hist August p    Severus who dreaded neither his arms nor his  Is deserted by the Praetorians  enchantments guarded himself from the only danger of secret conspiracy by the faithful attendance of six hundred chosen men who never quitted his person or their cuirasses either by night or by day during the whole march Advancing with a steady and rapid course he passed without difficulty the defiles of the Appennine received into his party the troops and ambassadors sent to retard his progress and made a short halt at Interamnia about seventy miles from  Rome His victory was already secure but the despair of the Praetorians might have rendered it bloody and Severus had the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing the sword  Victor and Eutropius viii mention a combat near the Milvian bridge the Ponte Molle unknown to the better and more ancient writers  His emissaries dispersed in the capital assured the guards that provided they would abandon their worthless prince and the perpetrators of the murder of Pertinax to the justice of the conqueror he would no longer consider that melancholy event as the act of the whole body The faithless Praetorians whose resistance was supported only by sullen obstinacy gladly complied with the easy conditions seized the greatest part of the assassins and signified to the senate that they no longer defended the cause of Julian That

of the senate  death against his unfortunate successor Julian was conducted into a private apartment of the baths of the palace and beheaded as a common criminal after having purchased with an immense  A D June  treasure an anxious and precarious reign of only sixtysix days  Dion l lxxiii p Herodian l ii p Hist August p  The almost incredible expedition of Severus who in so short a space of time conducted a numerous army from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber  proves at once the plenty of provisions produced by agriculture and commerce the goodness of the roads the discipline of the legions and the indolent subdued temper of the provinces  From these sixtysix days we must first deduct sixteen as Pertinax was murdered on the th of March and Severus most probably elected on the th of April see Hist August p and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iii p Note We cannot allow less than ten days after his election to put a numerous army in motion Forty days remain for this rapid march and as we may compute about eight hundred miles from Rome to the neighbourhood of Vienna the army of Severus marched twenty miles every day without halt or intermission    The first cares of Severus were bestowed on  Disgrace of the Praetorian guards  two measures the one dictated by policy the other by decency the revenge and the honours due to the memory of Pertinax Before the new emperor entered Rome he issued his commands to the Praetorian guards directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the city without arms but in the habits of ceremony in which they were accustomed to attend their sovereign He was obeyed by those haughty troops whose contrition was the effect of their just terrors A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with levelled spears Incapable of flight or resistance they expected their fate in silent consternation Severus mounted the tribunal sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice dismissed them with ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed despoiled them of their splendid ornaments and banished them on pain of death to the distance of an hundred miles from the capital During the transaction another  detachment had been sent to seize their arms occupy their camp and prevent the hasty consequences of their despair  Dion l lxxiv p Herodian l ii p    The funeral and consecration of Pertinax was  Funeral and apotheosis of Pertinax  next solemnized with every circumstances of sad magnificence  Dion l lxxiv p who assisted at the ceremony as a senator gives a most pompous description of it  The senate with a melancholy pleasure performed the last rites to that excellent prince whom they had loved and still regretted The concern of his successor was probably less sincere He esteemed the virtues of Pertinax but those virtues would for ever have confined his ambition to a private station Severus pronounced his funeral oration with studied eloquence inward satisfaction and wellacted sorrow and by this pious regard to his memory convinced the credulous multitude that  he alone  was worthy to supply his place Sensible however that arms not ceremonies must assert his claim to the empire he left Rome at the end of thirty days and without suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals  The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus  Success of Severus against Niger and against Albinus  have induced an elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the Caesars  Herodian l iii p  The parallel is at least imperfect Where shall we find in the character of Severus the commanding superiority of soul the generous clemency and the various genius which could  reconcile and unite the love of pleasure the thirst of knowledge and the fire of ambition  Though it is not most assuredly the intention of Lucan to exalt the character of Caesar yet the idea he gives of that hero in the tenth book of the Pharsalia where he describes him at the same time making love to Cleopatra sustaining a siege against the power of Egypt and conversing with the sages of the country is in reality the noblest panegyric  In one instance only they may be compared with some degree of propriety in the celerity of their motions and their civil victories In less than four years  Reckoning from his election April to the death of Albinus February See Tillemont's Chronology  Severus subdued the riches of the east and the valour of the west He vanquished  A D  two competitors of reputation and ability and defeated numerous armies provided with weapons and discipline equal to his own In that age the art of fortification and the principles of tactics were well understood by all the Roman generals and the constant superiority of Severus was that of an artist who uses the same instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals I shall not however enter into a minute narrative of these military operations but as the two civil wars against Niger and against Albinus were almost the same in their conduct event and consequences I shall collect into one point of view the most striking circumstances tending to develope the character of the conqueror and the state of the empire  Falsehood and insincerity unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of public transactions offend  Conduct of the two civil wars  us with a less degrading idea of meanness than when they are found in the intercourse of private life In the latter they discover a want of courage in the other only a defect of power and as it is impossible for the most able statesman to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength the world under the name of policy seems to have granted them a very liberal indulgence of craft and dissimulation Yet  Arts of Severus  the arts of Severus cannot be justified by the most ample privileges of state reason He promised only to betray he flattered only to ruin and however he might occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties his conscience obsequious to his interest always released him from the inconvenient obligation  Herodian l ii p    If his two competitors reconciled by their  towards Niger  common danger had advanced upon him without delay perhaps Severus would have sunk under their united effort Had they even attacked him at the same time with separate views and separate armies the contest might have been long and doubtful But they fell singly and successively an easy prey to the arts as well as arms of their subtle enemy lulled into security by the moderation of his professions and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action He first marched against Niger whose reputation and power he the most dreaded but he declined any hostile declarations suppressed the name of his antagonist and only signified to the senate and people  his intention of regulating the eastern provinces In private he spoke of Niger his old friend and intended successor  Whilst Severus was very dangerously ill it was industriously given out that he intended to appoint Niger and Albinus his successors As he could not be sincere with respect to both he might not be so with regard to either Yet Severus carried his hypocrisy so far as to profess that intention in the memoirs of his own life  with the most affectionate regard and highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of Pertinax To punish the vile usurper of the throne was the duty of every Roman general To persevere in arms and to resist a lawful emperor acknowledged by the senate would alone render him criminal  Hist August p  The sons of Niger had fallen into his hands among the children of the provincial governors detained at Rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents  This practice invented by Commodus proved very useful to Severus He found at Rome the children of many of the principal adherents of his rivals and he employed them more than once to intimidate or seduce the parents  As long as the power of Niger inspired terror or even respect they were educated with the most tender care with the children of Severus himself but they were soon involved in their father's ruin and removed first by exile and afterwards by death from the eye of public compassion  Herodian l iii p Hist August p    Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war  towards Albinus  he had reason to apprehend that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the Alps occupy the vacant seat of empire and oppose his return  with the authority of the senate and the forces of the west The ambiguous conduct of Albinus in not assuming the Imperial title left room for negotiation Forgetting at once his professions of patriotism and the jealousy of sovereign power he accepted the precarious rank of Caesar as a reward for his fatal neutrality Till the first contest was decided Severus treated the man whom he had doomed to destruction with every mark of esteem and regard Even in the letter in which he announced his victory over Niger he styles Albinus the brother of his soul and empire sends him the affectionate salutations of his wife Julia and his young family and intreats him to preserve the armies and the republic faithful to their common interest The messengers charged with this letter were instructed to accost the Caesar with respect to desire a private audience and to plunge their daggers into his heart  Hist August p Spartianus has inserted this curious letter at full length  The conspiracy was discovered and the too credulous Albinus at length passed over to the continent and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival who rushed upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army  The military labours of Severus seem inadequate  Event of the civil wars  to the importance of his conquests Two engagements the one near the Hellespont the other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia decided the fate of his Syrian competitor and the troops of Europe asserted their usual ascendant over the effeminate  natives of Asia  Consult the third book of Herodian and the seventyfourth book of Dion Cassius  The battle of Lyons where one hundred and fifty thousand  Dion l lxxv p  Romans were engaged was equally fatal to Albinus The valour of the British army maintained indeed a sharp and doubtful contest with the hardy discipline of the Illyrian legions The fame and person of Severus appeared during a few moments irrecoverably lost till that warlike prince rallied his fainting troops and led them on to a decisive victory  Dion l lxxv p Herodian l iii p Hist August p The battle was fought in the plain of Trevoux three or four leagues from Lyons See Tillemont tom iii p Note  The war was finished by that memorable day  The civil wars of modern Europe have been  decided by one or two battles  distinguished not only by the fierce animosity but likewise by the obstinate perseverance of the contending factions They have generally been justified by some principle or at least coloured by some pretext of religion freedom or loyalty The leaders were nobles of independent property and hereditary influence The troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused throughout the whole community a vanquished chief was immediately supplied with new adherents eager to shed their blood in the same cause But the Romans after the fall of the republic combated only for the choice of masters  Under the standard of a popular candidate for empire a few enlisted from affection some from fear many from interest none from principle The legions uninflamed by party zeal were allured into civil war by liberal donatives and still more liberal promises A defeat by disabling the chief from the performance of his engagements dissolved the mercenary allegiance of his followers and left them to consult their own safety by a timely desertion of an unsuccessful cause It was of little moment to the provinces under whose name they were oppressed or governed they were driven by the impulsion of the present power and as soon as that power yielded to a superior force they hastened to implore the clemency of the conqueror who as he had an immense debt to discharge was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers In the vast extent of the Roman empire there were few fortified cities capable of protecting a routed army nor was there any person or family or order of men whose natural interest unsupported by the powers of government was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party  Montesquieu Considerations sur la Grandeur et la Decadence des Romains c xii    Yet in the contest between Niger and Severus  Siege of Byzantium  a single city deserves an honourable exception As Byzantium was one of the greatest passages from Europe into Asia it had been provided with a strong garrison and a fleet of five  hundred vessels was anchored in the harbour  Most of these as may be supposed were small open vessels some however were gallies of two and a few of three ranks of oars  The impetuosity of Severus disappointed this prudent scheme of defence he left to his generals the siege of Byzantium forced the less guarded passage of the Hellespont and impatient of a meaner enemy pressed forward to encounter his rival Byzantium attacked by a numerous and increasing army and afterwards by the whole naval power of the empire sustained a siege of three years and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger The citizens and soldiers we know not from what cause were animated with equal fury several of the principal officers of Niger who despaired of or who disdained a pardon had thrown themselves into this last refuge the fortifications were esteemed impregnable and in the defence of the place a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic powers known to the ancients  The engineer's name was Priscus His skill saved his life and he was taken into the service of the conqueror For the particular facts of the siege consult Dion Cassius l lxxv p and Herodian l iii p for the theory of it the fanciful chevalier de Folard may be looked into See Polybe tom i p  Byzantium at length surrendered to famine The magistrates and soldiers were put to the sword the walls demolished the privileges suppressed and the destined capital of the east subsisted only as an open village subject to the insulting jurisdiction of Perinthus The historian Dion who had admired the flourishing and lamented the desolate  state of Byzantium accused the revenge of Severus for depriving the Roman people of the strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia  Notwithstanding the authority of Spartianus and some modern Greeks we may be assured from Dion and Herodian that Byzantium many years after the death of Severus lay in ruins  The truth of this observation was but too well justified in the succeeding age when the Gothic fleets covered the Euxine and passed through the undefended Bosphorus into the centre of the Mediterranean  Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and  Deaths of Niger and Albinus  put to death in their flight from the field of battle Their fate excited neither surprise nor compassion  Cruel consequences of the civil wars  They had staked their lives against the chance of empire and suffered what they would have inflicted nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a private station But his unforgiving temper stimulated by avarice indulged a spirit of revenge where there was no room for apprehension The most considerable of the provincials who without any dislike to the fortunate candidate had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were accidentally placed were punished by death exile and especially by the confiscation of their estates Many cities of the east were stript of their ancient honours and obliged to pay into the treasury of Severus four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for the service of Niger  Dion l lxxiv p    Till the final decision of the war the cruelty of Severus was in some measure restrained by the uncertainty of the event and his pretended  Animosity of Severus against the senate  reverence for the senate The head of Albinus accompanied with a menacing letter announced to the Romans that he was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate competitors He was irritated by the just suspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the senate and he concealed his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some treasonable correspondences Thirtyfive senators however accused of having favoured the party of Albinus he freely pardoned and by his subsequent behaviour endeavoured to convince them that he had forgotten as well as forgiven their supposed offences But at the same time he condemned fortyone  Dion l lxxv p only senators are mentioned by him but are named in the Augustan History p among whom were six of the name of Pescennius Herodian l iii p speaks in general of the cruelties of Severus  other senators whose names history has recorded their wives children and clients attended them in death and the noblest provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in the same ruin Such rigid justice for so he termed it was in the opinion of Severus the only conduct capable of ensuring peace to the people or stability to the prince and he condescended slightly to lament that to be mild it was necessary that he should first be cruel  Aurelius Victor    The true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with that of his people Their numbers their wealth their order and their security  The wisdom and justice of his government  are the best and only foundations of his real greatness and were he totally devoid of virtue prudence might supply its place and would dictate the same rule of conduct Severus considered the Roman empire as his property and had no sooner secured the possession than he bestowed his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition Salutary laws executed with inflexible firmness soon corrected most of the abuses with which since the death of Marcus every part of the government had been infected In the administration of justice the judgments of the emperor were characterized by attention discernment and impartiality and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity it was generally in favour of the poor and oppressed not so much indeed from any sense of humanity as from the natural propensity of a despot to humble the pride of greatness and to sink all his subjects to the same common level of absolute dependence His expensive taste for building magnificent shows and above all a constant and liberal distribution of corn and provisions were the surest means of captivating the affection of the Roman people  Dion l lxxvi p Hist August p Severus celebrated the secular games with extraordinary magnificence and he left in the public granaries a provision of corn for seven years at the rate of modii or about quarters per day I am persuaded that the granaries of Severus were supplied for a long term but I am not less persuaded that policy on one hand and admiration on the other magnified the hoard far beyond its true contents    The misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated The calm of peace and prosperity was once more experienced in the provinces and many cities  General peace and prosperity  restored by the munificence of Severus assumed the title of his colonies and attested by public monuments their gratitude and felicity  See Spanheim's treatise of ancient medals the inscriptions and our learned travellers Spon and Wheeler Shaw Pocock c who in Africa Greece and Asia have found more monuments of Severus than of any other Roman emperor whatsoever  The fame of the Roman arms was revived by that warlike and successful emperor  He carried his victorious arms to Seleucia and Ctesiphon the capitals of the Parthian monarchy I shall have occasion to mention this war in its proper place  and he boasted with a just pride that having received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic wars he left it established in profound universal and honourable peace  Etiam in Britannis  was his own just and emphatic expression Hist August    Although the wounds of civil war appeared  Relaxation of military discipline  completely healed its mortal poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution Severus possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability but the daring soul of the first Caesar or the deep policy of Augustus were scarcely equal to the task of curbing the insolence of the victorious legions By gratitude by misguided policy by seeming necessity Severus was induced to relax the nerves of discipline  Herodian l iii p Hist August p  The vanity of his  soldiers was flattered with the honour of wearing gold rings their ease was indulged in the permission of living with their wives in the idleness of quarters He increased their pay beyond the example of former times and taught them to expect and soon to claim extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or festivity Elated by success enervated by luxury and raised above the level of subjects by their dangerous privileges  Upon the insolence and privileges of the soldiers the th satire falsely ascribed to Juvenal may be consulted the style and circumstances of it would induce me to believe that it was composed under the reign of Severus or that of his son  they soon became incapable of military fatigue oppressive to the country and impatient of a just subordination Their officers asserted the superiority of rank by a more profuse and elegant luxury There is still extant a letter of Severus lamenting the licentious state of the army and exhorting one of his generals to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes themselves since as he justly observes the officer who has forfeited the esteem will never command the obedience of his soldiers  Hist August p  Had the emperor pursued the train of reflection he would have discovered that the primary cause of this general corruption might be ascribed not indeed to the example but to the pernicious indulgence however of the commander in chief  The Praetorians who murdered their emperor  New establishment of the Praetorian guards  and sold the empire had received the just punishment of their treason but the necessary  though dangerous institution of guards was soon restored on a new model by Severus and increased to four times the ancient number  Herodian l iii p  Formerly these troops had been recruited in Italy and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the softer manners of Rome the levies were extended to Macedonia Noricum and Spain In the room of these elegant troops better adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war it was established by Severus that from all the legions of the frontiers the soldiers most distinguished for strength valour and fidelity should be occasionally draughted and promoted as an honour and reward into the more eligible service of the guards  Dion l lxxiv p  By this new institution the Italian youth were diverted from the exercise of arms and the capital was terrified by the strange aspect and manners of a multitude of barbarians But Severus flattered himself that the legions would consider these chosen Praetorians as the representatives of the whole military order and that the present aid of fifty thousand men superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be brought into the field against them would for ever crush the hopes of rebellion and secure the empire to himself and his posterity  The command of these favoured and formidable  The office of Praetorian Praefect  troops soon became the first office of the empire As the government degenerated into military despotism the Praetorian Praefect who  in his origin had been a simple captain of the guards was placed not only at the head of the army but of the finances and even of the law In every department of administration he represented the person and exercised the authority of the emperor The first Praefect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus the favourjte minister of Severus His reign lasted above ten years till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the emperor which seemed to assure his fortune proved the occasion of his ruin  One of his most daring and wanton acts of power was the castration of an hundred free Romans some of them married men and even fathers of families merely that his daughter on her marriage with the young emperor might be attended by a train of eunuchs worthy of an Eastern queen Dion l lxxvi p  The animosities of the palace by irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus threatened to produce a revolution and obliged the emperor who still loved him to consent with reluctance to his death  Dion l lxxvi p Herodian l iii p The grammarian of Alexandria seems as it is not unusual much better acquainted with this mysterious transaction and more assured of the guilt of Plautianus than the Roman senator ventures to be  After the fall of Plautianus an eminent lawyer the celebrated Papinian was appointed to execute the motley office of Praetorian Praefect  Till the reign of Severus the virtue and even  The senate oppressed by military despotism  the good sense of the emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected reverence for the senate and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil policy instituted by Augustus But the youth of Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps and his riper years spent in  the despotism of military command His haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover or would not acknowledge the advantage of preserving an intermediate power however imaginary between the emperor and the army He disdained to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his person and trembled at his frown he issued his commands where his request would have proved as effectual assumed the conduct and style of a sovereign and a conqueror and exercised without disguise the whole legislative as well as the executive power  The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious  New maxims of the Imperial prerogative  Every eye and every passion were directed to the supreme magistrate who possessed the arms and treasure of the state whilst the senate neither elected by the people nor guarded by military force nor animated by public spirit rested its declining authority on the frail and crumbling basis of ancient opinion The fine theory of a republic insensibly vanished and made way for the more natural and substantial feelings of monarchy As the freedom and honours of Rome were successively communicated to the provinces in which the old government had been either unknown or was remembered with abhorrence the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obliterated The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines  Appian in Proem  observe with a malicious pleasure that although the sovereign of Rome in compliance with an obsolete prejudice abstained from the name of king he possessed the  full measure of regal power In the reign of Severus the senate was filled with polished and eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces who justified personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude These new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the court and with patience by the people when they inculcated the duty of passive obedience and descanted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom The lawyers and the historians concurred in teaching that the Imperial authority was held not by the delegated commission but by the irrevocable resignation of the senate that the emperor was freed from the restraint of civil laws could command by his arbitrary will the lives and fortunes of his subjects and might dispose of the empire as of his private patrimony  Dion Cassius seems to have written with no other view than to form these opinions into an historical system The Pandects will shew how assiduously the lawyers on their side laboured in the cause of prerogative  The most eminent of the civil lawyers and particularly Papinian Paulus and Ulpian flourished under the house of Severus and the Roman jurisprudence having closely united itself with the system of monarchy was supposed to have attained its full maturity and perfection  The contemporaries of Severus in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of his reign forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced Posterity who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire  CHAP VI  The Death of ServerusTyranny of CaracallaUsurpation of MacrinusFollies of ElagabalusVirtues of

power all his prospects of life were closed The desire of perpetuating the greatness of his family was the only remaining wish of his ambition and paternal tenderness  Like most of the Africans Severus was passionately  His wife the empress Julia  addicted to the vain studies of magic and divination deeply versed in the interpretation  of dreams and omens and perfectly acquainted with the science of judicial astrology which in almost every age except the present has maintained its dominion over the mind of man He had lost his first wife whilst he was governor of the Lionnese Gaul

most splendid  reputation She was the patroness of every art and the friend of every man of genius  See a Dissertation of Menage at the end of his edition of Diogenes Laertius de Foeminis Philosophis  The grateful flattery of the learned has celebrated her virtues but if we may credit the scandal of ancient history chastity was very far from being the most conspicuous virtue of the empress Julia  Dion l lxxvi p Aurelius Victor    Two sons Caracalla  Bassianus was his first name as it had been that of his maternal grandfather During his reign he assumed the appellation of Antoninus which is employed by lawyers and ancient historians After his death the public indignation loaded him with the nicknames of Tarantus and Caracalla The first was borrowed from a celebrated Gladiator the second from a long Gallic gown which he distributed to the people of Rome  and Geta were the fruit  Their two sons Caracalla and Geta  of this marriage and the destined heirs of the empire The fond hopes of the father and of the Roman world were soon disappointed by these vain youths who displayed the indolent security of hereditary princes and a presumption that fortune would supply the place of merit and application Without any emulation of virtue or talents they discovered almost from their infancy a fixed and implacable antipathy for each other Their aversion confirmed by years and  Their mutual aversion to each other  fomented by the arts of their interested favourites broke out in childish and gradually in more serious competitions and at length divided the theatre the circus and the court into two factions actuated by the hopes and fears of their respective leaders The prudent emperor endeavoured by every expedient of advice and  authority to allay this growing animosity The unhappy discord of his sons clouded all his prospects and threatened to overturn a throne raised with so much labour cemented with so much blood and guarded with every defence of arms and treasure With an impartial hand he maintained between them an exact balance of favour conferred on both the rank of Augustus with the revered name of Antoninus and for the first time the Roman world beheld three emperors  The elevation of Caracalla is fixed by the accurate M de Tillemont to the year the association of Geta to the year    Three emperors  Yet even this equal conduct served only to inflame the contest whilst the fierce Caracalla asserted the right of primogeniture and the milder Geta courted the affections of the people and the soldiers In the anguish of a disappointed father Severus foretold that the weaker of his sons would fall a sacrifice to the stronger who in his turn would be ruined by his own vices  Herodian l iii p The lives of Caracalla and Geta in the Augustan History    In these circumstances the intelligence of a war  The Caledonian war  in Britain and of an invasion of the province by the barbarians of the North was received  A D  with pleasure by Severus Though the vigilance of his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant enemy he resolved to embrace the honourable pretext of withdrawing his sons from the luxury of Rome which enervated their minds and irritated their passions and of inuring their youth to the toils of war and government Notwithstanding his advanced age for  he was above threescore and his gout which obliged him to be carried in a litter he transported himself in person into that remote island attended by his two sons his whole court and a formidable army He immediately passed the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus and entered the enemy's country with a design of completing the long attempted conquest of Britain He penetrated to the northern extremity of the island without meeting an enemy But the concealed ambuscades of the Caledonians who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army the coldness of the climate and the severity of a winter march across the hills and morasses of Scotland are reported to have cost the Romans above fifty thousand men The Caledonians at length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack sued for peace and surrendered a part of their arms and a large tract of territory But their apparent submission lasted no longer than the present terror As soon as the Roman legions had retired they resumed their hostile independence Their restless spirit provoked Severus to send a new army into Caledonia with the most bloody orders not to subdue but to extirpate the natives They were saved by the death of their haughty enemy  Dion l lxxvi p c Herodian l iii p c    This Caledonian war neither marked by decisive  Fingal and his heroes  events nor attended with any important consequences would ill deserve our attention but it is supposed not without a considerable  degree of probability that the invasion of Severus is connected with the most shining period of the British history or fable Fingal whose fame with that of his heroes and bards has been revived in our language by a recent publication is said to have commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture to have eluded the power of Severus and to have obtained a signal victory on the banks of the Carun in which the son of  the King of the World  Caracul fled from his arms along the fields of his pride  Ossian's Poems vol i p  Something of a doubtful mist still hangs over these Highland traditions nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most ingenious researches of modern criticism  That the Caracul of Ossian is the Caracalla of the Roman History is perhaps the only point of British antiquity in which Mr Macpherson and Mr Whitaker are of the same opinion and yet the opinion is not without difficulty In the Caledonian war the son of Severus was known only by the appellation of Antoninus and it may seem strange that the Highland bard should describe him by a nickname invented four years afterwards scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor and seldom employed by the most ancient historians See Dion l lxxvii p Hist August p Aurel Victor Euseb in Chron ad ann  but if we could with safety indulge  Contrast of the Caledonians and the Romans  the pleasing supposition that Fingal lived and that Ossian sung the striking contrast of the situation and manners of the contending nations might amuse a philosophic mind The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more civilized people if we compared the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla  with the bravery the tenderness the elegant genius of Ossian the mercenary chiefs who from motives of fear or interest served under the Imperial standard with the freeborn warriors who started to arms at the voice of the king of Morven if in a word we contemplated the untutored Caledonians glowing with the warm virtues of nature and the degenerate Romans polluted with the mean vices of wealth and slavery  The declining health and last illness of Severus  Ambition of Caracalla  inflamed the wild ambition and black passions of Caracalla's soul Impatient of any delay or division of empire he attempted more than once to shorten the small remainder of his father's days and endeavoured but without success to excite a mutiny among the troops  Dion l lxxvi p Hist August p Aurel Victor  The old emperor had often censured the misguided lenity of Marcus who by a single act of justice might have saved the Romans from the tyranny of his worthless son Placed in the same situation he experienced how easily the rigour of a judge dissolves away in the tenderness of a parent He deliberated he threatened but he could not punish and this last and only instance of mercy was more fatal to the empire than a long series of cruelty  Dion l lxxvi p Hist August p  The disorder of his mind  Death of Severus and accession of his two sons  irritated the pains of his body he wished impatiently for death and hastened the instant of it by his impatience He expired at York in  A D th February  the sixtyfifth year of his life and in the eighteenth of a glorious and successful reign In his last moments he recommended concord to his sons and his sons to the army The salutary advice never reached the heart or even the understanding of the impetuous youths but the more obedient troops mindful of their oath of allegiance and of the authority of their deceased master resisted the solicitations of Caracalla and proclaimed both brothers emperors of Rome The new princes soon left the Caledonians in peace returned to the capital celebrated their father's funeral with divine honours and were cheerfully acknowledged as lawful sovereigns by the senate the people and the provinces Some preeminence of rank seems to have been allowed to the elder brother but they both administered the empire with equal and independent power  Dion l lxxvi p Herodian l iii p    Such a divided form of government would have  Jealousy and hatred of the two emperors  proved a source of discord between the most affectionate brothers It was impossible that it could long subsist between two implacable enemies who neither desired nor could trust a reconciliation It was visible that one only could reign and that the other must fall and each of them judging of his rival's designs by his own guarded his life with the most jealous vigilance from the repeated attacks of poison or the sword Their rapid journey through Gaul and Italy  during which they never eat at the same table or slept in the same house displayed to the provinces the odious spectacle of fraternal discord On their arrival at Rome they immediately divided the vast extent of the Imperial palace  Mr Hume is justly surprised at a passage of Herodian l iv p who on this occasion represents the Imperial palace as equal in extent to the rest of Rome The whole region of the Palatine Mount on which it was built occupied at most a circumference of eleven or twelve thousand feet See the Notitia and Victor in Nardini's Roma Antica But we should recollect that the opulent senators had almost surrounded the city with their extensive gardens and suburb palaces the greatest part of which had been gradually confiscated by the emperors If Geta resided in the gardens that bore his name on the Janiculum and if Caracalla inhabited the gardens of Maecenas on the Esqueline the rival brothers were separated from each other by the distance of several miles and yet the intermediate space was filled by the Imperial gardens of Sallust of Lucullus of Agrippa of Domitian of Caius c all skirting round the city and all connected with each other and with the palace by bridges thrown over the Tiber and the streets But this explanation of Herodian would require though it ill deserves a particular dissertation illustrated by a map of ancient Rome  No communication was allowed between their apartments the doors and passages were diligently fortified and guards posted and relieved with the same strictness as in a besieged place The emperors met only in public in the presence of their afflicted mother and each surrounded by a numerous train of armed followers Even on these occasions of ceremony the dissimulation of courts could ill disguise the rancour of their hearts  Herodian l iv p    This latent civil war already distracted the  Fruitless negociation for dividing the empire between them  whole government when a scheme was suggested that seemed of mutual benefit to the hostile brothers  It was proposed that since it was impossible to reconcile their minds they should separate their interest and divide the empire between them The conditions of the treaty were already drawn with some accuracy It was agreed that Caracalla as the elder brother should remain in possession of Europe and the western Africa and that he should relinquish the sovereignty of Asia and Egypt to Geta who might fix his residence at Alexandria or Antioch cities little inferior to Rome itself in wealth and greatness that numerous armies should be constantly encamped on either side of the Thracian Bosphorus to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies and that the senators of European extraction should acknowledge the sovereign of Rome whilst the natives of Asia followed the emperor of the East The tears of the empress Julia interrupted the negociation the first idea of which had filled every Roman breast with surprise and indignation The mighty mass of conquest was so intimately united by the hand of time and policy that it required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder The Romans had reason to dread that the disjointed members would soon be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of one master but if the separation was permanent the division of the provinces must terminate in the dissolution of an empire whose unity had hitherto remained inviolate  Herodian l iv p    Had the treaty been carried into execution the sovereign of Europe might soon have been the conqueror of Asia but Caracalla obtained an  Murder of Geta  easier though a more guilty victory He artfully  A D th February  listened to his mother's entreaties and

the deed was perpetrated Caracalla with hasty steps and horror in his countenance ran towards the Praetorian camp as his only refuge and threw himself on the ground before the statues of the tutelar deities  Herodian l iv p In every Roman camp there was a small chapel near the headquarters in which the statues of the tutelar deities were preserved and adored and we may remark that the eagles and other military ensigns were in the first rank of these deities an excellent institution which confirmed discipline by the sanction of religion See Lipsius de Militia Romana iv v  The soldiers attempted to raise and comfort him In broken and disordered words he informed them of his imminent danger and fortunate escape insinuating that he had prevented the designs of his enemy and declared his resolution to live and die with his faithful  troops Geta had been the favourite of the soldiers but complaint was useless revenge was dangerous and they still reverenced the son of Severus Their discontent died away in idle murmurs and Caracalla soon convinced them of the justice of his cause by distributing in one lavish donative the accumulated treasures of his father's reign  Herodian l iv p Dion l lxxvii p  The real  sentiments  of the soldiers alone were of importance to his power or safety Their declaration in his favour commanded the dutiful  professions  of the senate The obsequious assembly was always prepared to ratify the decision of fortune but as Caracalla wished to assuage the first emotions of public indignation the name of Geta was mentioned with decency and he received the funeral honours of a Roman emperor  Geta was placed among the gods Sit  divus  dum non sit  vivus  said his brother Hist August p Some marks of Geta's consecration are still found upon medals  Posterity in pity to his misfortune has cast a veil over his vices We consider that young prince as the innocent victim of his brother's ambition without recollecting that he himself wanted power rather than inclination to consummate the same attempts of revenge and murder  The crime went not unpunished Neither  Remorse and cruelty of Caracalla  business nor pleasure nor flattery could defend Caracalla from the stings of a guilty conscience and he confessed in the anguish of a tortured mind that his disordered fancy often beheld the angry forms of his father and his brother rising  into life to threaten and upbraid him  Dion l lxxvii p  The consciousness of his crime should have induced him to convince mankind by the virtues of his reign that the bloody deed had been the involuntary effect of fatal necessity But the repentance of Caracalla only prompted him to remove from the world whatever could remind him of his guilt or recal the memory of his murdered brother On his return from the senate to the palace he found his mother in the company of several noble matrons weeping over the untimely fate of her younger son The jealous emperor threatened them with instant death the sentence was executed against Fadilla the last remaining daughter of the emperor Marcus and even the afflicted Julia was obliged to silence her lamentations to suppress her sighs and to receive the assassin with smiles of joy and approbation It was computed that under the vague appellation of the friends of Geta above twenty thousand persons of both sexes suffered death His guards and freedmen the ministers of his serious business and the companions of his looser hours those who by his interest had been promoted to any commands in the army or provinces with the longconnected

a family in which the love of liberty seemed an hereditary quality  Dion l lxxvii p He was probably descended from Helvidius Priscus and Thrasea Paetus those patriots whose firm but useless and unseasonable virtue has been immortalized by Tacitus  The particular causes of calumny and suspicion were at length exhausted and when a senator was accused of being a secret enemy to the government the emperor was satisfied with the general proof that he was a man of property and virtue From this wellgrounded principle he frequently drew the most bloody inferences  The execution of so many innocent citizens  Death of Papinian  was bewailed by the secret tears of their friends and families The death of Papinian the Praetorian praefect was lamented as a public calamity During the last seven years of Severus he had exercised the most important offices of the state and by his salutary influence guided the emperor's steps in the paths of justice and moderation In full assurance of his virtues and abilities Severus on his deathbed had conjured him to watch over the prosperity and union  of the Imperial family  It is said that Papinian was himself a relation of the empress Julia  The honest labours of Papinian served only to inflame the hatred which Caracalla had already conceived against his father's minister After the murder of Geta the Praefect was commanded to exert the powers of his skill and eloquence in a studied apology for that atrocious deed The philosophic Seneca had condescended to compose a similar epistle to the senate in the name of the son and assassin of Agrippina  Tacit Annal xiv ii    That it was easier to commit than to justify a parricide  was the glorious reply of Papinian  Hist August p  who did not hesitate between the loss of life and that of honour Such intrepid virtue which had escaped pure and unsullied from the intrigues of courts the habits of business and the arts of his profession reflects more lustre on the memory of Papinian than all his great employments his numerous writings and the superior reputation as a lawyer which he has preserved through every age of the Roman jurisprudence  With regard to Papinian see Heineccius's Historia Juris Romani l c    It had hitherto been the peculiar felicity of the Romans and in the worst of times their consolation  His tyranny extended over the whole empire  that the virtue of the emperors was active and their vice indolent Augustus Trajan Hadrian and Marcus visited their extensive dominions in person and their progress was marked by acts of wisdom and beneficence  The tyranny of Tiberius Nero and Domitian who resided almost constantly at Rome or in the adjacent villas was confined to the senatorial and equestrian orders  Tiberius and Domitian never moved from the neighbourhood of Rome Nero made a short journey into Greece  Et laudatorum Principum usus ex aequo quamvis procul agentibus Saevi proximis ingruunt  Tacit Hist iv  But Caracalla was the common enemy of mankind He left the capital and he never returned to it about a year  A D  after the murder of Geta The rest of his reign was spent in the several provinces of the empire particularly those of the East and every province was by turns the scene of his rapine and cruelty The senators compelled by fear to attend his capricious motions were obliged to provide daily entertainments at an immense expence which he abandoned with contempt to his guards and to erect in every city magnificent palaces and theatres which he either disdained to visit or ordered to be immediately thrown down The most wealthy families were ruined by partial fines and consiscations and the great body of his subjects oppressed by ingenious and aggravated taxes  Dion l lxxvii p  In the midst of peace and upon the slightest provocation he issued his commands at Alexandria in Egypt for a general massacre From a secure post in the temple of Serapis he viewed and directed the slaughter of many thousand citizens as well as strangers without distinguishing either the number or the crime of the sufferers since as he coolly informed  the senate  all  the Alexandrians those who had perished and those who had escaped were alike guilty  Dion l lxxvii p Herodian l iv p The former represents it as a cruel massacre the latter as a perfidious one too It seems probable that the Alexandrians had irritated the tyrant by their railleries and perhaps by their tumults    The wise instructions of Severus never made  Relaxation of discipline  any lasting impression on the mind of his son who although not destitute of imagination and eloquence was equally devoid of judgment and humanity  Dion l lxxvii p  One dangerous maxim worthy of a tyrant was remembered and abused by Caracalla  To secure the affections of the army and to esteem the rest of his subjects as of little moment  Dion l lxxvi p Mr Wotton Hist of Rome p suspects that this maxim was invented by Caracalla himself and attributed to his father    But the liberality of the father had been restrained by prudence and his indulgence to the troops was tempered by firmness and authority The careless profusion of the son was the policy of one reign and the inevitable ruin both of the army and of the empire The vigour of the soldiers instead of being confirmed by the severe discipline of camps melted away in the luxury of cities The excessive increase of their pay and donatives  Dion l lxxviii p informs us that the extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to the army amounted annually to seventy millions of drachmae about two millions three hundred and fifty thousand pounds There is another passage in Dion concerning the military pay infinitely curious were it not obscure imperfect and probably corrupt The best sense seems to be that the Praetorian received twelve hundred and fifty drachmae forty pounds a year Dion l lxxvii p Under the reign of Augustus they were paid at the rate of two drachmae or denarii per day a year Tacit Annal i Domitian who increased the soldiers pay one fourth must have raised the Praetorians to drachmae Gronovius de PecuniÃ¢ Veteri l iii c These successive augmentations ruined the empire for with the soldiers pay their numbers too were increased We have seen the Praetorians alone increased from to men  exhaustguards  ed the state to enrich the military order whose modesty in peace and service in war is best secured by an honourable poverty The demeanor of Caracalla was haughty and full of pride but with the troops he forgot even the proper dignity of his rank encouraged their insolent familiarity and neglecting the essential duties of a general affected to imitate the dress and manners of a common soldier  It was impossible that such a character and  Murder of Caracalla A D th March  such a conduct as that of Caracalla could inspire either love or esteem but as long as his vices were beneficial to the armies he was secure from the danger of rebellion A secret conspiracy provoked by his own jealousy was fatal to the tyrant The Praetorian praefecture was divided between two ministers The military department was intrusted to Adventus an experienced rather than an able soldier and the civil affairs were transacted by Opilius Macrinus who by his dexterity in business had raised himself with a fair character to that high office But his favour varied with the caprice of the emperor and his life might depend on the slightest suspicion or the most casual circumstance Malice or fanaticism had suggested to an African deeply  skilled in the knowledge of futurity a very dangerous prediction that Macrinus and his son were destined to reign over the empire The report was soon diffused through the province and when the man was sent in chains to Rome he still asserted in the presence of the Praefect of the city the faith of his prophecy That magistrate who had received the most pressing instructions to inform himself of the  successors  of Caracalla immediately communicated the examination of the African to the Imperial court which at that time resided in Syria But notwithstanding the diligence of the public messengers a friend of Macrinus found means to apprize him of the approaching danger The emperor received the letters from Rome and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot race he delivered them unopened to the Praetorian Praefect directing him to dispatch the ordinary affairs and to report the more important business that might be contained in them Macrinus read his fate and resolved to prevent it He inflamed the discontents of some inferior officers and employed the hand of Martialis a desperate soldier who had been refused the rank of centurion The devotion of Caracalla prompted him to make a pilgrimage from Edessa to the celebrated temple of the Moon at Carrhae He was attended by a body of cavalry but having stopped on the road for some necessary occasion his guards preserved a respectful distance and Martialis approaching his person under a pretence of duty stabbed him with a dagger The bold  assassin was instantly killed by a Scythian archer of the Imperial guard Such was the end of a monster whose life disgraced human nature and whose reign accused the patience of the Romans  Dion l lxxviii p Herodian l iv p  The grateful soldiers forgot his vices remembered only his partial liberality and obliged the senate to prostitute their own dignity and that of religion by granting him a place among the gods Whilst he was upon earth Alexander  Imitation of Alexander  the Great was the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration He assumed the name and ensigns of Alexander formed a Macedonian phalanx of guards persecuted the disciples of Aristotle and displayed with a puerile enthusiasm the only sentiment by which he discovered any regard for virtue or glory We can easily conceive that after the battle of Narva and the conquest of Poland Charles the Twelfth though he still wanted the more elegant accomplishments of the son of Philip might boast of having rivalled his valour and magnanimity but in no one action of his life did Caracalla express the faintest resemblance of the Macedonian hero except in the murder of a great number of his own and of his father's friends  The fondness of Caracalla for the name and ensigns of Alexander is still preserved on the medals of that emperor See Spanheim de Usu Numismatum Dissertat xii Herodian l iv p had seen very ridiculous pictures in which a figure was drawn with one side of the face like Alexander and the other like Caracalla    After the extinction of the house of Severus  Election and character of Macrinus  the Roman world remained three days without a  master The choice of the army for the authority of a distant and feeble senate was little regarded hung in an anxious suspense as no candidate presented himself whose distinguished birth and merit could engage their attachment and unite their suffrages The decisive weight of the Praetorian guards elevated the hopes of their praefects and these powerful ministers began to assert their  legal  claim to fill the vacancy of the Imperial throne Adventus however the senior praefect conscious of his age and infirmities of his small reputation and his smaller abilities resigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his colleague Macrinus whose welldissembled grief removed all suspicion of his being accessary to his master's death  Herodian l iv p Hist August p  The troops neither loved nor esteemed his character They cast their eyes around in search of a competitor and at last yielded with reluctance to his promises of unbounded liberality and indulgence A short time after his accession he conferred on  A D March  his son Diadumenianus at the age of only ten years the Imperial title and the popular name of Antoninus The beautiful figure of the youth assisted by an additional donative for which the ceremony furnished a pretext might attract it was hoped the favour of the army and secure the doubtful throne of Macrinus  The authority of the new sovereign had been  Discontent of the senate  ratified by the cheerful submission of the senate and provinces They exulted in their unexpected  deliverance from a hated tyrant and it seemed of little consequence to examine into the virtues of the successor of Caracalla But as soon as the first transports of joy and surprise had subsided they began to scrutinize the merits of Macrinus with a critical severity and to arraign the hasty choice of the army It had hitherto been considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitution that the emperor must be always chosen in the senate and the sovereign power no longer exercised by the whole body was always delegated to one of its members But Macrinus was not a senator  Dion l lxxxviii p Elagabalus reproached his predecessor with daring to seat himself on the throne though as Praetorian Praefect he could not have been admitted into the senate after the voice of the cryer had cleared the house The personal favour of Plautianus and Sejanus had broke through the established rule They rose indeed from the equestrian order but they preserved the praesecture with the rank of senator and even with the consulship  The sudden elevation of the Praetorian praesects betrayed the meanness of their origin and the equestrian order was still in possession of that great office which commanded with arbitrary sway the lives and fortunes of the senate A murmur of indignation was heard that a man whose obscure  He

of the last age  extraction had never been illustrated by any signal service should dare to invest himself with the purple instead of bestowing it on some distinguished senator equal  in birth and dignity to the splendour of the Imperial station As soon as the character of Macrinus was surveyed by the sharp eye of discontent some vices and many defects were easily discovered The choice of his ministers was in many instances justly censured and the dissatisfied people with their usual candour accused at once his indolent tameness and his excessive severity  Both Dion and Herodian speak of the virtues and vices of Macrinus with candour and impartiality but the author of his life in the Augustan History seems to have implicitly copied some of the venal writers employed by Elagabalus to blacken the memory of his predecessor    His rash ambition had climbed a height where it was difficult to stand with firmness and impossible  and the army  to fall without instant destruction Trained in the arts of courts and the forms of civil business he trembled in the presence of the fierce and undisciplined multitude over whom he had assumed the command his military talents were despised and his personal courage suspected a whisper that circulated in the camp disclosed the fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy and heightened contempt by detestation To alienate the soldiers and to provoke inevitable ruin the character of a reformer was only wanting and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate that Macrinus was compelled to exercise that invidious office The prodigality of Caracalla had left behind it a long train of ruin and disorder and if that worthless  tyrant had been capable of reflecting on the sure consequences of his own conduct he would perhaps have enjoyed the dark prospect of the distress and calamities which he bequeathed to his successors  In the management of this necessary reformation  Macrinus attempts a reformation of the army  Macrinus proceeded with a cautious prudence which would have restored health and vigour to the Roman army in an easy and almost imperceptible manner To the soldiers already engaged in the service he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and extravagant pay given by Caracalla but the new recruits were received on the more moderate though liberal establishment of Severus and gradually formed to modesty and obedience  Dion l lxxxiii p The sense of the author is as clear as the intention of the emperor but M Wotton has mistaken both by understanding the distinction not of veterans and recruits but of old and new legions History of Rome p  One fatal error destroyed the salutary effects of this judicious plan The numerous army assembled in the East by the late emperor instead of being immediately dispersed by Macrinus through the several provinces was suffered to remain united in Syria during the winter that followed his elevation In the luxurious idleness of their quarters the troops viewed their strength and numbers communicated their complaints and revolved in their minds the advantages of another revolution The veterans instead of being flattered by the advantageous distinction were alarmed by the first steps of the emperor which they  considered as the presage of his future intentions The recruits with sullen reluctance entered on a service whose labours were increased while its rewards were diminished by a covetous and unwarlike sovereign The murmurs of the army swelled with impunity into seditious clamours and the partial mutinies betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection that waited only for the slightest occasion to break out on every side into a general rebellion To minds thus disposed the occasion soon presented itself  The empress Julia had experienced all the vicissitudes  Death of the empress Julia Education pretensions and revolt of Elagabalus called at

of her sons and over the life of the other The cruel fate of Caracalla though her good sense must have long taught her to expect it awakened the feelings of a mother and of an empress Notwithstanding the respectful civility expressed by the usurper towards the widow of Severus she descended with a painful struggle into the condition of a subject and soon withdrew herself by a voluntary death from the anxious and humiliating dependence  Dion l lxxviii p The abridgment of Xiphilin though less particular is in this place clearer than the original  Julia Maesa her sister was ordered to leave the

Bassianus for that was the name of the son of Soaemias was consecrated to the honourable ministry of high priest of the Sun and this holy vocation embraced either from prudence or superstition contributed to raise the Syrian youth to the empire of Rome A numerous body of troops was stationed at Emesa and as the severe discipline of Macrinus had constrained them to pass the winter encamped they were eager to revenge the cruelty of such unaccustomed hardships The soldiers who resorted in crowds to the temple of the Sun beheld with veneration and delight the elegant dress and figure of a young pontiff they recognised or they thought that they recognised the features of Caracalla whose memory they now adored The artful Maesa saw and cherished their rising partiality and readily sacrificing her daughter's reputation to the fortune of her grandson she insinuated that Bassianus was the natural son of their murdered sovereign The sums distributed by her emissaries with a lavish hand silenced every objection and the profusion sufficiently proved the affinity or at least the resemblance of Bassianus with the great original The young Antoninus for he had assumed and polluted

was killed March he was born December and was consequently about this time thirteen years old as his elder cousin might be about seventeen This computation suits much better the history of the young princes than that of Herodian l v p who represents them as three years younger whilst by an opposite error of chronology he lengthens the reign of Elagabalus two years beyond its real duration For the particulars of the conspiracy see Dion l lxxviii p Herodian l v p    Whilst a conspiracy of women and eunuchs was  Defeat and death of Macrinus  concerted with prudence and conducted with rapid vigour Macrinus who by a decisive motion might have crushed his infant enemy floated between the opposite extremes of terror and security which alike fixed him inactive at Antioch A spirit of rebellion diffused itself through all the camps and garrisons of Syria successive detachments murdered their officers  By a most dangerous proclamation of the pretended Antoninus every soldier who brought in his officer's head became entitled to his private estate as well as to his military commission  and joined the party of the rebels and the tardy restitution of military pay and privileges was imputed to the acknowledged weakness of Macrinus At length he marched out of Antioch to meet the increasing and zealous army of the young pretender His own troops seemed to take the field with faintness and reluctance but in the heat of the battle  Dion l lxxviii p Herodian l v p The battle was fought near the village of Immae about two and twenty miles from Antioch  the Praetorian guards  A D th June  almost by an involuntary impulse asserted the  superiority of their valour and discipline The rebel ranks were broken when the mother and grandmother of the Syrian prince who according to their eastern custom had attended the army threw themselves from their covered chariots and by exciting the compassion of the soldiers endeavoured to animate their drooping courage Antoninus himself who in the rest of his life never acted like a man in this important crisis of his fate approved himself a hero mounted his horse and at the head of his rallied troops charged sword in hand among the thickest of the enemy whilst the eunuch Gannys whose occupations had been confined to female cares and the soft luxury of Asia displayed the talents of an able and experienced general The battle still raged with doubtful violence and Macrinus might have obtained the victory had he not betrayed his own cause by a shameful and precipitate flight His cowardice served only to protract his life a few days and to stamp deserved ignominy on his misfortunes It is scarcely necessary to add that his son Diadumenianus was involved in the same fate As soon as the stubborn Praetorians could be convinced that they fought for a prince who had basely deserted them they surrendered to the conqueror the contending parties of the Roman army mingling tears of joy and tenderness united under the banners of the imagined son of Caracalla and the East acknowledged with pleasure the first emperor of Asiatic extraction  The letters of Macrinus had condescended to inform the senate of the slight disturbance occasioned by an impostor in Syria and a decree immediately  Elagabalus writes to the senate  passed declaring the rebel and his family public enemies with a promise of pardon however to such of his deluded adherents as should merit it by an immediate return to their duty During the twenty days that elapsed from the declaration to the victory of Antoninus for in so short an interval was the fate of the Roman world decided the capital and the provinces more especially those of the East were distracted with hopes and fears agitated with tumult and stained with a useless effusion of civil blood since whosoever of the rivals prevailed in Syria must reign over the empire The specious letters in which the young conqueror announced his victory to the obedient senate were filled with professions of virtue and moderation the shining examples of Marcus and Augustus he should ever consider as the great rule of his administration and he affected to dwell with pride on the striking resemblance of his own age and fortunes with those of Augustus who in the earliest youth had revenged by a successful war the murder of his father By adopting the style of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus son of Antoninus and grandson of Severus he tacitly asserted his hereditary claim to the empire but by assuming the tribunitian and proconsular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree of the senate he offended the delicacy of Roman prejudice This new and injudicious violation of the constitution  was probably dictated either by the ignorance of his Syrian courtiers or the fierce disdain of his military followers  Dion l lxxix p    As the attention of the new emperor was diverted  Picture of Elagabalus A D  by the most trifling amusements he wasted many months in his luxurious progress from

elevation to the throne The display of superstitious gratitude was the only serious business of his reign The triumph of the god of Emesa over all the religions of the earth was the great object of his zeal and vanity and the appellation of Elagabalus for he presumed as pontiff and favourite to adopt that sacred name was dearer to him than all the titles of Imperial greatness In a solemn procession through the streets of Rome the way was strewed with gold dust the black stone set in precious gems was placed on a chariot drawn by six milkwhite horses richly caparisoned The pious emperor held the reins and supported by his ministers moved slowly backwards that he might perpetually enjoy the felicity of the divine presence In a magnificent temple raised on the Palatine Mount the sacrifices of the god Elagabalus were celebrated with every circumstance of cost and solemnity The richest wines the most extraordinary victims and the rarest aromatics were profusely consumed on his altar Around the altar a chorus of Syrian damsels performed their lascivious dances to the sound of barbarian music whilst the gravest personages of the state and army clothed in long Phoenician tunics officiated in the meanest functions with affected zeal and secret indignation  Herodian l v p    To this temple as to the common centre of religious worship the Imperial fanatic attempted to

Roman tyrants  Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy and blackened by prejudice  Even the credulous compiler of his life in the Augustan history p is inclined to suspect that his vices may have been exaggerated  Yet confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people and attested by grave and contemporary historians their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country The licence of an eastern monarch is secluded from the eye of curiosity by the inaccessible walls of his seraglio The sentiments of honour and gallantry have introduced a refinement of pleasure a regard for decency and a respect for the public opinion into the modern courts of Europe but  the corrupt and opulent nobles of Rome gratified every vice that could be collected from the mighty conflux of nations and manners Secure of impunity careless of censure they lived without restraint in the patient and humble society of their slaves and parasites The emperor in his turn viewing every rank of his subjects with the same contemptuous indifference asserted without control his sovereign privilege of lust and luxury  The most worthless of mankind are not afraid  Discontents of the army  to condemn in others the same disorders which they allow in themselves and can readily discover some nice difference of age character or station to justify the partial distinction The licentious soldiers who had raised to the throne the dissolute son of Caracalla blushed at their ignominious choice and turned with disgust from that monster to contemplate with pleasure the opening virtues of his cousin Alexander the son of Mamaea The crafty Maesa sensible that her grandson Elagabalus must inevitably destroy himself by his own vices had provided another and surer support of her family Embracing a favourable moment of fondness and devotion she had persuaded the young emperor to adopt Alexander  Alexander Severus declared Caesar A D  and to invest him with the title of Caesar that his own divine occupations might be no longer interrupted by the care of the earth In the second rank that amiable prince soon acquired the affections of the public and excited the tyrant's jealousy who resolved to terminate the dangerous competition either by corrupting the manners or by taking away the life of his rival  His arts proved unsuccessful his vain designs were constantly discovered by his own loquacious folly and disappointed by those virtuous and faithful servants whom the prudence of Mamaea had placed about the person of her son In a hasty sally of passion Elagabalus resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to compass by fraud and by a despotic sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and honours of Caesar The message was received in the senate with silence and in the camp with fury The Praetorian guards swore to protect Alexander and to revenge the dishonoured majesty of the throne The tears and promises of the trembling Elagabalus who only begged them to spare his life and to leave him in the possession of his beloved Hierocles diverted their just indignation and they contented themselves with empowering their praefects to watch over the safety of Alexander and the conduct of the emperor  Dion l lxxix p Herodian l v p Hist August p The last of the three historians seems to have followed the best

instance of their affection for his cousin and their contempt for his person the emperor ventured to punish some of the leaders of the mutiny His unseasonable severity proved instantly fatal to his minions his mother and himself Elagabalus was massacred by the indignant Praetorians his mutilated corpse dragged through the streets of the city and thrown into the Tyber His memory was branded with eternal infamy by the senate the justice of whose decree has been ratified by posterity  The aera of the death of Elagabalus and of the accession of Alexander has employed the learning and ingenuity of Pagi Tillemont Valsecchi Vignoli and Torre bishop of Adria The question is most assuredly intricate but I still adhere to the authority of Dion the truth of whose calculations is undeniable and the purity of whose text is justified by the agreement of Xiphilin Zonaras and Cedrenus Elagabalus reigned three years nine months and four days from his victory over Macrinus and was killed March But what shall we reply to the medals undoubtedly genuine which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power We shall reply with tho learned Valsecchi that the usurpation of Macrinus was annihilated and that the son of Caracalla dated his reign from his father's death After resolving this great difficulty the smaller knots of this question may be easily untied or cut asunder    In the room of Elagabalus his cousin Alexander  Accession of Alexander Severus  was raised to the throne by the Praetorian guards His relation to the family of Severus whose name he assumed was the same as that of his predecessor his virtue and his danger had already endeared him to the Romans and the eager liberality of the senate conferred upon him in one day the various titles and powers of the  Imperial dignity  Hist August p By this unusual precipitation the senate meant to confound the hopes of pretenders and prevent the factions of the armies  But as Alexander was a modest and dutiful youth of only seventeen years of age the reins of government were in the hands of two women of his mother Mamaea and of Maesa his grandmother After the death of the latter who survived but a short time the elevation of Alexander Mamaea remained the sole regent of her son and of the empire  In every age and country the wiser or at least  Power of his mother Mamaea  the stronger of the two sexes has usurped the powers of the state and confined the other to the cares and pleasures of domestic life In hereditary monarchies however and especially in those of modern Europe the gallant spirit of chivalry and the law of succession have accustomed us to allow a singular exception and a woman is often acknowledged the absolute sovereign of a great kingdom in which she would be deemed incapable of exercising the smallest employment civil or military But as the Roman emperors were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the republic their wives and mothers although distinguished

the honours of the empire which she had conferred on her son but her mad ambition detested by every citizen who felt for the dignity of Rome was disappointed by the artful firmness of Seneca and Burrhus  Tacit Annal xiii  The good sense or the indifference of succeeding princes restrained them from offending the prejudices of their subjects and it was reserved for the profligate Elagabalus to discharge the acts of the senate with the name of his mother Soaemias who was placed by the side of the consuls and subscribed as a regular member the decrees of the legislative assembly Her more prudent sister Mamaea declined the useless and odious prerogative and a solemn law was enacted excluding women for ever from the senate and devoting to the infernal gods the head of the wretch by whom this sanction should be violated  Hist August p  The substance not the pageantry of power was the object of Mamaea's manly ambition She maintained an absolute and lasting empire over the mind of her son and in his affection the mother could not brook a rival Alexander with her consent married the daughter of a Patrician but his respect for his fatherinlaw and love for the empress were inconsistent with the tenderness or interest of Mamaea The Patrician was executed on the ready accusation  of treason and the wife of Alexander driven with ignominy from the palace and banished into Africa  Dion l lxxx p Herodian l vi p Hist August p Herodian represents the Patricians as innocent The Augustan History on the authority of Dexippus condemns him as guilty of a conspiracy against the life of Alexander It is impossible to pronounce between them but Dion is an irreproachable witness of the jealousy and cruelty of Mamaea toward the young empress whose hard fate Alexander lamented but durst not oppose    Notwithstanding this act of jealous cruelty as  Wise and moderate administration  well as some instances of avarice with which Mamaea is charged the general tenour of her administration was equally for the benefit of her son and of the empire With the approbation of the senate she chose sixteen of the wisest and most virtuous senators as a perpetual council of state before whom every public business of moment was debated and determined The celebrated Ulpian equally distinguished by his knowledge of and his respect for the laws of Rome was at their head and the prudent firmness of this aristocracy restored order and authority to the government As soon as they had purged the city from foreign superstition and luxury the remains of the capricious tyranny of Elagabalus they applied themselves to remove his worthless creatures from every department of public administration and to supply their places with men of virtue and ability Learning and the love of justice became the only recommendations for civil offices Valour and the love of discipline  the only qualifications for military employments  Herodian l vi p Hist August p The latter insinuates that when any law was to be passed the council was assisted by a number of able lawyers and experienced senators whose opinions were separately given and taken down in writing    But the most important care of Mamaea and  Education and virtuous temper of Alexander  her wise counsellors was to form the character of the young emperor on whose personal qualities the happiness or misery of the Roman world must ultimately depend The fortunate soil assisted and even prevented the hand of cultivation An excellent understanding soon convinced Alexander of the advantages of virtue the pleasure of knowledge and the necessity of labour A natural mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the assaults of passion and the allurements of vice His unalterable regard for his mother and his esteem for the wise Ulpian guarded his unexperienced youth from the poison of flattery  The simple journal of his ordinary occupations  Journal of his ordinary life  exhibits a pleasing picture of an accomplished emperor  See his life in the Augustan History The undistinguishing compiler has buried these interesting anecdotes under a load of tririal and unmeaning circumstances  and with some allowance for the difference of manners might well deserve the imitation of modern princes Alexander rose early the first moments of the day were consecrated to private devotion and his domestic chapel was filled with the images of those heroes who by improving or reforming human life had deserved the grateful reverence of posterity But as he  deemed the service of mankind the most acceptable worship of the gods the greatest part of his morning hours was employed in his council where he discussed public affairs and determined private causes with a patience and discretion above his years The dryness of business was relieved by the charms of literature and a portion of time was always set apart for his favourite studies of poetry history and philosophy The works of Virgil and Horace the republics of Plato and Cicero formed his taste enlarged his understanding and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government The exercises of the body succeeded to those of the mind and Alexander who was tall active and robust surpassed most of his equals in the gymnastic arts Refreshed by the use of the bath and a slight dinner he resumed with new vigour the business of the day and till the hour of supper the principal meal of the Romans he was attended by his secretaries with whom he read and answered the multitude of letters memorials and petitions that must have been addressed to the master of the greatest part of the world His table was served with the most frugal simplicity and whenever he was at liberty to consult his own inclination the company consisted of a few select friends men of learning and virtue amongst whom Ulpian was constantly invited Their conversation was familiar and instructive and the pauses were occasionally enlivened by the recital of some pleasing composition which supplied the place of the dancers comedians and even gladiators  so frequently summoned to the tables of the rich and luxurious Romans  See the th Satire of Juvenal  The dress of Alexander was plain and modest his demeanor courteous and affable at the proper hours his palace was open to all his subjects but the voice of a crier was heard as in the Eleusinian mysteries pronouncing the same salutary admonition  Let none enter those holy walls unless he is conscious of a pure and innocent mind  Hist August p    Such an uniform tenour of life which left  General happiness of the Roman world A D  not a moment for vice or folly is a better proof of the wisdom and justice of Alexander's government than all the trifling details preserved in the compilation of Lampridius Since the accession of Commodus the Roman world had experienced during a term of forty years the successive and various vices of four tyrants From the death of Elagabalus it enjoyed an auspicious calm of thirteen years The provinces relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by Caracalla and his pretended son flourished in peace and prosperity under the administration of magistrates who were convinced by experience that to deserve the love of the subjects was their best and only method of obtaining the favour of their sovereign While some gentle restraints were imposed on the innocent luxury of the Roman people the price of provisions and the interest of money were reduced  by the paternal care of Alexander whose prudent liberality without distressing the industrious supplied the wants and amusements of the populace The dignity the freedom the authority of the senate were restored and every virtuous senator might approach the person of the emperor without fear and without a blush  The name of Antoninus ennobled by the virtues  Alexander refuses the name of Antoninus  of Pius and Marcus had been communicated by adoption to the dissolute Verus and by descent to the cruel Commodus It became the honourable appellation of the sons of Severus was bestowed on young Diadumenianus and at length prostituted to the infamy of the high priest of Emesa Alexander though pressed by the studied and perhaps sincere importunity of the senate nobly refused the borrowed lustre of a name whilst in his whole conduct he laboured to restore the glories and felicity of the age of the genuine Antonines  See in the Hist August p the whole contest between Alexander and the senate extracted from the journals of that assembly It happened on the sixth of March probably of the year when the Romans had enjoyed almost a twelvemonth the blessings of his reign Before the appellation of Antoninus was offered him as a title of honour the senate waited to see whether Alexander would not assume it as a family name    In the civil administration of Alexander wisdom  He attempts to reform the army  was enforced by power and the people sensible of the public felicity repaid their benefactor with their love and gratitude There still remained a greater a more necessary but a more difficult enterprise the reformation of the military order whose interest and temper confirmed  by long impunity rendered them impatient of the restraints of discipline and careless of the blessings of public tranquility In the execution of his design the emperor affected to display his love and to conceal his fear of the army The most rigid oeconomy in every other branch of the administration supplied a fund of gold and silver for the ordinary pay and the extraordinary rewards of the troops In their marches he relaxed the severe obligation of carrying seventeen days provision on their shoulders Ample magazines were formed along the public roads and as soon as they entered the enemy's country a numerous train of mules and camels waited on their haughty laziness As Alexander despaired of correcting the luxury of his soldiers he attempted at least to direct it to objects of martial pomp and ornament fine horses splendid armour and shield enriched with silver and gold He shared whatever fatigues he was obliged to impose visited in person the sick and wounded preserved an exact register of their services and his own gratitude and expressed on every occasion the warmest regard for a body of men whose welfare as he affected to declare was so closely connected with that of the state  It was a favourite saying of the emperor's Se milites magis servare quam seipsum quod salus publica in his esset Hist August p  By the most gentle arts he laboured to inspire the fierce multitude with a sense of duty and to restore at least a faint image of that discipline to which the Romans owed their empire over so  many other nations as warlike and more powerful than themselves But his prudence was vain his courage fatal and the attempt towards a reformation served only to inflame the ills it was meant to cure  The Praetorian guards were attached to the  Seditions of the Praetorian guards and murder of Ulpian  youth of Alexander They loved him as a tender pupil whom they had saved from a tyrant's fury and placed on the Imperial throne That amiable prince was sensible of the obligation but as his gratitude was restrained within the limits of reason and justice they soon were more dissatisfied with the virtues of Alexander than they had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus Their praefect the wise Ulpian was the friend of the laws and of the people he was considered as the enemy of the soldiers and to his pernicious counsels every scheme of reformation was imputed Some trifling accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny and a civil war raged during three days in Rome whilst the life of that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people Terrified at length by the sight of some houses in flames and by the threats of a general conflagration the people yielded with a sigh and left the virtuous but unfortunate Ulpian to his fate He was pursued into the Imperial palace and massacred at the feet of his master who vainly strove to cover him with the purple and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers Such was the deplorable weakness of government that the emperor was unable to revenge his murdered  friend and his insulted dignity without stooping to the arts of patience and dissimulation Epagathus the principal leader of the mutiny was removed from Rome by the honourable employment of praefect of Egypt from that high rank he was gently degraded to the government of Crete and when at length his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and absence Alexander ventured to inflict the tardy but deserved punishment of his crimes  Though the author of the life of Alexander Hist August p mentions the sedition raised against Ulpian by the soldiers he conceals the catastrophe as it might discover a weakness in the administration of his hero From this designed omission we may judge of the weight and candour of that author  Under the reign of a just and virtuous prince the tyranny of the army threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers who were suspected of an intention to correct their intolerable disorders The historian Dion Cassius had commanded the  Danger of Dion Cassius  Pannonian legions with the spirit of ancient discipline Their brethren of Rome embracing the common cause of military licence demanded the head of the reformer Alexander however instead of yielding to their seditious clamours shewed a just sense of his merit and services by appointing him his colleague in the consulship and defraying from his own treasury the expence of that vain dignity but as it was justly apprehended that if the soldiers beheld him with the ensigns of his office they would revenge the insult in his blood the nominal first magistrate of the state retired by the emperor's advice from  the city and spent the greatest part of his confulship at his villas in Campania  For an account of Ulpian's fate and his own danger see the mutilated conclusion of Dion's History l lxxx p    The lenity of the emperor confirmed the insolence  Tumults of the legions  of the troops the legions imitated the example of the guards and defended their prerogative of licentiousness with the same furious obstinacy The administration of Alexander

authority was insulted and his life at last sacrificed to the fierce discontents of the army  Annot Reimar ad Dion Cassius l lxxx p  One particular fact well deserves to  Firmness of the emperor  be recorded as it illustrates the manners of the troops and exhibits a singular instance of their return to a sense of duty and obedience Whilst the emperor lay at Antioch in his Persian expedition the particulars of which we shall hereafter relate the punishment of some soldiers who had been discovered in the baths of women excited a sedition in the legion to which they belonged Alexander ascended his tribunal and with a modest firmness represented to the armed multitude the absolute necessity as well as his inflexible resolution of correcting the vices introduced by his impure predecessor and of maintaining the discipline which could not be relaxed without the ruin of the Roman name and empire Their clamours interrupted his mild expostulation  Reserve your shouts said the undaunted emperor

and shame silently confessed the justice of their punishment and the power of discipline yielded up their arms and military ensigns and retired in confusion not to their camp but to the several inns of the city Alexander enjoyed during thirty days the edifying spectacle  of their repentance nor did he restore them to their former rank in the army till he had punished with death those tribunes whose connivance had occasioned the mutiny The grateful legion served the emperor whilst living and revenged him when dead  Hist August p    The resolutions of the multitude generally depend  Defects of his reign and character  on a moment and the caprice of passion might equally determine the seditious legion to lay down their arms at the emperor's feet or to plunge them into his breast Perhaps if the singular transaction had been investigated by the penetration of a philosopher we should discover the secret causes which on that occasion authorized the boldness of the prince and commanded the obedience of the troops and perhaps if it had been related by a judicious historian we should find this action worthy of Caesar himself reduced nearer to the level of probability and the common standard of the character of Alexander Severus The abilities of that amiable prince seem to have been inadequate to the difficulties of his situation the firmness of his conduct inferior to the purity of his intentions His virtues as well as the vices of Elagabalus contracted a tincture of weakness and effeminacy from the soft climate of Syria of which he was a native though he blushed at his foreign origin and listened with a vain complacency to the flattering genealogists who derived his race from  the ancient stock of Roman nobility  From the Metelli Hist August p The choice was

greater number of our modern writers abuse Herodian and copy the Augustan History See Mess de Tillemont and Wotton From the opposite prejudice the emperor Julian in Caesarib p dwells with a visible satisfaction on the effeminate weakness of the  Syrian  and the ridiculous avarice of his mother  The fatigues of the Persian war irritated the military discontent the unsuccessful event degraded the reputation of the emperor as a general and even as a soldier Every cause prepared and every circumstance hastened a revolution which distracted the Roman empire with a long series of intestine calamities  The dissolute tyranny of Commodus the civil wars occasioned by his death and the new maxims  Digression on the finances of the empire  of policy introduced by the house of Severus had all contributed to increase the dangerous power of the army and to obliterate the faint image of laws and liberty that was still impressed  on the minds of the Romans This internal change which undermined the foundations of the empire we have endeavoured to explain with some degree of order and perspicuity The personal characters of the emperors their victories laws follies and fortunes can interest us no farther than as they are connected with the general history of the Decline and Fall of the monarchy Our constant attention to that great object will not suffer us to overlook a most important edict of Antoninus Caracalla which communicated to all the free inhabitants of the empire the name and privileges of Roman citizens His unbounded liberality flowed not however from the sentiments of a generous mind it was the forbid result of avarice and will naturally be illustrated by some observations on the finances of that state from the victorious ages of the commonwealth to the reign of

senate wisely prevented  the clamours of the people by the institution of a regular pay for the soldiers which was levied by a general tribute assessed according to an equitable proportion on the property of the citizens  See the th and th books of Livy In the Roman Census property power and taxation were commensurate with each other  During more than two hundred years after the conquest of Veii the victories of the republic added less to the wealth than to the power of Rome The states of Italy paid their tribute in military service only and the vast force both by sea and land which was exerted in the Punic wars was maintained at the expence of the Romans themselves That highspirited people such is often the generous enthusiasm of freedom cheerfully submitted to the most excessive but voluntary burdens in the just confidence that they should speedily enjoy the rich harvest of their labours Their expectations were not disappointed In the course of a few years the riches of Syracuse of Carthage of Macedonia and of Asia were brought in triumph to Rome The treasures of Perseus alone amounted to near  and abolition of the tribute on Roman citizens  two millions sterling and the Roman people the sovereign of so many nations was for ever delivered from the weight of taxes  Plin Hist Natur l xxxiii c Cicero de Offic ii Plutarch in P Aemil p  The increasing revenue of the

more irreparable injury than in the loss of the curious register bequeathed by Augustus to the senate in which that experienced prince so accurately balanced the revenues and expences of the Roman empire  Tacit in Annal i It seems to have existed in the time of Appian  Deprived of this clear and comprehensive estimate we are reduced to collect a few imperfect hints from such of the ancients as have accidentally turned aside from the splendid to the more useful parts of history We are informed that by the conquests of Pompey the tributes of Asia were raised from fifty to  of Asia  one hundred and thirtyfive millions of drachms or about four millions and a half sterling  Plutarch in Pompeio p    of Egypt  Under the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies the revenue of Egypt is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five hundred talents a sum equivalent to more than two millions and a half of our money but which was afterwards considerably improved by the more exact oeconomy of

silver or about three hundred thousand pounds a year  Strabo l iii p  Twenty thousand pound weight of gold was annually received from the provinces of Asturia Gallicia and Lusitania  Plin Hist Natur l xxxiii c He mentions likewise a silver mine in Dalmatia that yielded every day fifty pounds to the state    We want both leisure and materials to pursue  of the isle of Gyarus  this curious inquiry through the many potent states that were annihilated in the Roman empire Some notion however may be formed of the revenue of the provinces where considerable wealth had been deposited by nature or collected by man if we observe the severe attention that was directed to the abodes of solitude and sterility Augustus once received a petition from the inhabitants of Gyarus humbly praying that they might be relieved from onethird of their excessive impositions Their whole tax amounted indeed to no more than one hundred and fifty drachms or about five pounds but Gyarus was a little island or rather a rock of the Aegean sea destitute of fresh water and every necessary of life and inhabited only by a few wretched fishermen  Strabo l x p Tacit Annal iii and iv See in Tournefort Voyages au Levant Lettre viii a very lively picture of the actual misery of Gyarus    From the saint glimmerings of such doubtful  Amount of the revenue  and scattered lights we should be inclined to believe st That with every fair allowance for  the difference of times and circumstances the general income of the Roman provinces could seldom amount to less than fifteen or twenty millions of our money  Lipsius de magnitudine RomanÃ¢ l ii c computes the revenue at one hundred and fifty millions of gold crowns but his whole book though learned and ingenious betrays a very heated imagination  and dly That so ample a revenue must have been fully adequate to all the expences of the moderate government instituted by Augustus whose court was the modest family of a private senator and whose military establishment was calculated for the defence of the frontiers without any aspiring views of conquest or any serious apprehension of a foreign invasion  Notwithstanding the seeming probability of  Taxes on Roman citizens instituted by Augustus  both these conclusions the latter of them at least is positively disowned by the language and conduct of Augustus It is not easy to determine whether on this occasion he acted as the common father of the Roman world or as the oppressor of liberty whether he wished to relieve the provinces or to impoverish the senate and the equestrian order But no sooner had he assumed the reins of government than he frequently intimated the insufficiency of the tributes and the necessity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon Rome and Italy In the prosecution of this unpopular design he advanced however by cautious and wellweighed steps The introduction of customs was followed by the establishment of an excise  and the scheme of taxation was completed by an artful assessment on the real and personal property of the Roman citizens who had been exempted from any kind of contribution above a century and a half  I In a great empire like that of Rome a  The customs  natural balance of money must have gradually established itself It has been already observed that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the strong hand of conquest and power so a considerable part of it was restored to the industrious provinces by the gentle influence of commerce and arts In the reign of Augustus and his successors duties were imposed on every kind of merchandise which through a thousand channels flowed to the great centre of opulence and luxury and in whatsoever manner the law was expressed it was the Roman purchaser and not the provincial merchant who paid the tax  Tacit Annal xiii  The rate of the customs varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity and we have a right to suppose that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those of necessity and that the productions raised or manufactured by the labour of the subjects of the empire were treated with more indulgence than was shewn to the pernicious or at least the unpopular commerce of Arabia and  India  See Pliny Hist Natur l vi c l xii c His observation that the Indian commodities were sold at Rome at a hundred times their original price may give us some notion of the produce of the customs since that original price amounted to more than eight hundred thousand pounds  There is still extant a long but imperfect catalogue of eastern commodities which about the time of Alexander Severus were subject to the payment of duties cinnamon myrrh pepper ginger and the whole tribe of aromatics a great variety of precious stones among which the diamond was the most remarkable for its price and the emerald for its beauty  The ancients were unacquainted with the art of cutting diamonds  Parthian and Babylonian leather cottons silks both raw and manufactured ebony ivory and eunuchs  M Bouchaud in his treatise de l'Impot chez les Romains has transcribed this catalogue from the Digest and attempts to illustrate it by a very prolix commentary  We may observe that the use and value of those effeminate slaves gradually rose with the decline of the empire  II The excise introduced by Augustus after the civil wars was extremely moderate but it  The excise  was general It seldom exceeded one  per cent  but it comprehended whatever was sold in the markets or by public auction from the most considerable purchases of lands and houses to those minute objects which can only derive a value from their infinite multitude and daily consumption Such a tax as it affects the body of the people has ever been the occasion of clamour and discontent An emperor well acquainted  with the wants and resources of the state was obliged to declare by a public edict that the support of the army depended in a great measure on the produce of the excise  Tacit Annal i Two years afterwards the reduction of the poor kingdom of Cappadocia gave Tiberius a pretence for diminishing the excise to one half but the relief was of very short duration    III When Augustus resolved to establish a  Tax on legacies and inheritances  permanent military force for the defence of his government against foreign and domestic enemies he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay of the soldiers the rewards of the veterans and the extraordinary expences of war The ample revenue of the excise though peculiarly appropriated to those uses was found inadequate To supply the deficiency the emperor suggested a new tax of five  per cent  on all legacies and inheritances But the nobles of Rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom Their indignant murmurs were received by Augustus with his usual temper He candidly referred the whole business to the senate and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other expedient of a less odious nature They were divided and perplexed He insinuated to them that their obstinacy would oblige him to  propose  a general landtax and capitation They acquiesced in silence  Dion Cassius l lv p l lvi p  The new imposition on legacies and inheritances was however mitigated by some restrictions It did not take place unless the object was of a certain value  most probably of fifty or an hundred pieces of gold  The sum is only fixed by conjecture  nor could it be exacted from the nearest of kin on the father's side  As the Roman law subsisted for many ages the  Cognati  or relations on the mother's side were not called to the succession This harsh institution was gradually undermined by humanity and finally abolished by Justinian  When the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured it seemed reasonable that a stranger or a distant relation who acquired an unexpected accession of fortune should cheerfully resign a twentieth part of it for the benefit of the state  Plin Panegyric c    Such a tax plentiful as it must prove in every  Suited to the laws and manners  wealthy community was most happily suited to the situation of the Romans who could frame their arbitrary wills according to the dictates of reason or caprice without any restraint from the modern fetters of entails and settlements From various causes the partiality of paternal affection often lost its influence over the stern patriots of the commonwealth and the dissolute nobles of the empire and if the father bequeathed to his son the fourth part of his estate he removed all ground of legal complaint  See Heineccius in the Antiquit Juris Romani l ii  But a rich childless old man was a domestic tyrant and his power increased with his years and infirmities A servile crowd in which he frequently reckoned praetors and consuls courted his smiles pampered his avarice applauded his follies served his passions and waited with impatience for his  death The arts of attendance and flattery were formed into a most lucrative science those who professed it acquired a peculiar appellation and the whole city according to the lively descriptions of satire was divided between two parties the hunters and their game  Horat l ii Sat v Petron c c Plin l ii Epist  Yet while so many unjust and extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning and subscribed by folly a few were the result of rational esteem and virtuous gratitude Cicero who had so often defended the lives and fortunes of his fellowcitizens was rewarded with legacies to the amount of an hundred and seventy thousand pounds  Cicero in Philipp ii c  nor do the friends of the younger Pliny seem to have been less generous to that amiable orator  See his epistles Every such will gave him an occasion of displaying his reverence to the dead and his justice to the living He reconciled both in his behaviour to a son who had been disinherited by his mother v  Whatever was the motive of the testator the treasury claimed without distinction the twentieth part of his estate and in the course of two or three generations the whole property of the subject must have gradually passed through the coffers of the state  In the first and golden years of the reign of Nero  Regulations of the emperors  that prince from a desire of popularity and perhaps from a blind impulse of benevolence conceived a wish of abolishing the oppression of the customs and excise The wisest senators applauded his magnanimity but they diverted him  from the execution of a design which would have dissolved the strength and resources of the republic  Tacit Annal xiii Esprit des Loix l xii c  Had it indeed been possible to realize this dream of fancy such princes as Trajan and the Antonines would surely have embraced with ardour the glorious opportunity of conferring so signal an obligation on mankind Satisfied however with alleviating the public burden they attempted not to remove it The mildness and precision of their laws ascertained the rule and measure of taxation and protected the subject of every rank against arbitrary interpretations antiquated claims and the insolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue  See Pliny's Panegyric the Augustan History and Burman de Vectigal passim  For it is somewhat singular that in every age the best and wisest of the Roman governors persevered in this pernicious method of collecting the principal branches at least of the excise and customs  The tributes properly so called were not farmed since the good princes often remitted many millions of arrears    The sentiments and indeed the situation of  Edict of Caracalla  Caracalla were very different from those of the Antonines Inattentive or rather averse to the welfare of his people he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the insatiate avarice which he had excited in the army Of the several impositions introduced by Augustus the twentieth on inheritances and legacies was the most fruitful as well as the most comprehensive As its  influence was not confined to Rome or Italy the produce continually increased with the gradual extension of the ROMAN CITY The new citizens though charged on equal terms  The situation of the new citizens is minutely described by Pliny Panegyric c Trajan published a law very much in their favour  with the payment of new taxes which had not affected them as subjects derived an ample compensation from the rank they obtained the privileges they acquired and the fair prospect of honours and fortune that was thrown open to their ambition But the favour which implied a distinction  The freedom of the city given to all the provincials for the purpose of taxation  was lost in the prodigality of Caracalla and the reluctant provincials were compelled to assume the vain title and the real obligations of Roman citizens Nor was the rapacious son of Severus contented with such a measure of taxation as had appeared sufficient to his moderate predecessors Instead of a twentieth he exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances and during his reign for the ancient proportion was restored after his death he crushed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his iron sceptre  Dion l lxxvii p    When all the provincials became liable

Such were not the maxims of government adopted by Caracalla and his pretended son The old as well as the new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces  It was reserved for the virtue of Alexander to relieve them in a great measure from this intolerable grievance by reducing the tributes to a thirtieth part of the sum exacted at the time of his accession  He who paid ten  aurei  the

impossible to conjecture the motive that engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil but the noxious weed which had not been totally eradicated again sprang up with the most luxuriant growth and in the succeeding age darkened the Roman world with its deadly shade In the course of this history we shall be too often summoned to explain the landtax the capitation and the

who had received a liberal education were well instructed in the advantages of laws and letters and who had risen by equal steps through the regular succession of civil and military honours  See the lives of Agricola Vespasian Trajan Severus and his three competitors and indeed of all the eminent men of those times  To their influence and example we may partly ascribe the modest obedience of the legions during the two first centuries of the Imperial history  But when the last enclosure of the Roman constitution was trampled down by Caracalla the separation of professions gradually succeeded to the distinction of ranks The more polished citizens of the internal provinces were alone qualified to act as lawyers and magistrates The rougher trade of arms was abandoned to the peasants and barbarians of the frontiers who knew no country but their camp no science but that of war no civil laws and scarcely those of military discipline With bloody hands savage manners and desperate

decease the property of a nation like that of a drove of oxen descends to his infant son as yet unknown to mankind and to himself and that the bravest warriors and the wisest statesmen relinquishing their natural right to empire approach the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of inviolable fidelity Satire and declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colours but our more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice that establishes a rule of succession independent of the passions of mankind and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous and indeed the ideal power of giving themselves a master  In the cool shade of retirement we may easily  and solid advantages of hereditary succession  devise imaginary forms of government in which  the sceptre shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy by the free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community Experience overturns these airy fabrics and teaches us that in a large society the election of a monarch can never devolve to the wisest or to the most numerous part of the people The army is the only order of men sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments and powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their fellowcitizens but the temper of soldiers habituated at once to violence and to slavery renders them very unfit guardians of a legal or even a civil constitution Justice humanity or political wisdom are qualities they are too little acquainted with in themselves to appreciate them in others Valour will acquire their esteem and liberality will purchase their suffrage but the first of these merits is often lodged in the most savage breasts the latter can only exert itself at the expence of the public and both may be turned against the possessor of the throne by the ambition of a daring rival  The superior prerogative of birth when it has  Want of it in the Roman empire productive of the greatest calamities  obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among mankind The acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction and the conscious security disarms the cruelty of the monarch To the firm establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and mild administration of European monarchies To the defect of it we must attribute the frequent civil  wars through which an Asiatic Despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers Yet even in the East the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the reigning house and as soon as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the sword and the bowstring he no longer entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjects But the Roman empire after the authority of the senate had sunk into contempt was a vast scene of confusion The royal and even noble families of the provinces had long since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans The ancient families of Rome had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Caesars and whilst those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth and disappointed by the repeated failure of their posterity  There had been no example of three successive generations on the throne only three instances of sons who succeeded their fathers The marriages of the Caesars notwithstanding the permission and the frequent practice of divorces were generally unfruitful  it was impossible that any idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds of their subjects The right to the throne which none could claim from birth every one assumed from merit The daring hopes of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law and prejudice and the meanest of mankind might without folly entertain a hope of being raised by valour and fortune to a rank in the army in which a single crime would enable him to wrest the sceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular master After the murder  of Alexander Severus and the elevation of Maximin no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne and every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that august but dangerous station  About thirtytwo years before that event the  Birth and fortunes of Maximin  emperor Severus returning from an eastern expedition halted in Thrace to celebrate with military games the birthday of his younger son Geta The country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited in his rude dialect that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wrestling As the pride of discipline would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thracian peasant he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground His victory was rewarded by some trifling gifts and a permission to inlist in the troops The next day the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits dancing and exulting after the fashion of his country As soon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor's notice he instantly ran up to his horse and followed him on foot without the least appearance of fatigue in a long and rapid career  Thracian said Severus with astonishment art thou disposed to wrestle after thy race  Most willingly Sir replied the unwearied youth and almost in a breath overthrew seven of the strongest soldiers in the army A gold collar was  the prize of his matchless vigour and activity and he was immediately appointed to serve in the horseguards who always attended on the person of the sovereign  Hist August p    Maximin for that was his name though born on the territories of the empire descended from  His military service and honours  a mixed race of barbarians His father was a Goth and his mother of the nation of the Alani He displayed on every occasion a valour equal to his strength and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the knowledge of the world Under the reign of Severus and his son he obtained the rank of centurion with the favour and esteem of both those princes the former of whom was an excellent judge of merit Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the assassin of Caracalla Honour taught him to decline the effeminate insults of Elagabalus On the accession of Alexander he returned to court and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service and honourable to himself The fourth legion to which he was appointed tribune soon became under his care the best disciplined of the whole army With the general applause of the soldiers who bestowed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and Hercules he was successively promoted to the first military command  Hist August p Herodian l vi p Aurelius Victor By comparing these authors it should seem that Maximin had the particular command of the Triballian horse with the general commission of disciplining the recruits of the whole army His Biographer ought to have marked with more care his exploits and the successive steps of his military promotions  and had not he still retained too much  of his savage origin the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in marriage to the son of Maximin  See the original letter of Alexander Severus Hist August    Instead of securing his fidelity these favours  Conspiracy of Maximin  served only to inflame the ambition of the Thracian peasant who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit as long as he was constrained to acknowledge a superior Though a stranger to real wisdom he was not devoid of a selfish cunning which shewed him that the emperor had lost the affection of the army and taught him to improve their discontent to his own advantage It is easy for faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of the best of princes and to accuse even their virtues by artfully confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of Maximin They blushed at their own ignominious patience which during thirteen years had supported the vexatious discipline imposed by an effeminate Syrian the timid slave of his mother and of the senate It was time they cried to cast away that useless phantom of the civil power and to elect for their prince and general a real soldier educated in camps exercised in war who would assert the glory and distribute among his companions the treasures of the empire A great  army was at that time assembled on the banks of the Rhine under the command of the emperor himself who almost immediately after his return from the Persian war had been obliged to march against the barbarians of Germany The important care of training and reviewing the new levies was intrusted to Maximin One day as he entered the field of exercise the troops either from a sudden impulse or a formed conspiracy saluted him emperor silenced by their loud acclamations his obstinate refusal and hastened to consummate their rebellion by the murder of  A D March  Alexander Severus  The circumstances of his death are variously  Murder of Alexander Severus  related The writers who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of Maximin affirm that after taking a frugal repast in the sight of the army he retired to sleep and that about the seventh hour of the day a part of his own guards broke into the Imperial tent and with many wounds assassinated their virtuous and unsuspecting prince  Hist August p I have softened some of the most improbable circumstances of this wretched biographer From this illworded narration it should seem that the prince's buffoon having accidentally entered the tent and awakened the slumbering monarch the fear of punishment urged him to persuade the disaffected soldiers to commit the murder  If we credit another and indeed a more probable account Maximin was invested with the purple by a numerous detachment at the distance of several miles from the headquarters and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than to the  public declarations of the great army Alexander had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among his troops but their reluctant professions of fidelity quickly vanished on the appearance of Maximin who declared himself the friend and advocate of the military order and was unanimously acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding legions The son of Mamaea betrayed and deserted withdrew into his tent desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multitude He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions the ministers of death but instead of receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke his unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his life and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire His mother Mamaea whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of his ruin perished with her son The most faithful of his friends were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers Others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper and those who experienced the mildest treatment were stripped of their employments and ignominiously driven from the court and army  Herodian l vi p    The former tyrants Caligula and Nero Commodus  Tyranny of Maximin  and Caracalla were all dissolute and unexperienced youths  Caligula the eldest of the four was only twentyfive years of age when he ascended the throne Caracalla was twentythree Commodus nineteen and Nero no more than seventeen  educated in the purple and  corrupted by the pride of empire the luxury of Rome and the perfidious voice of flattery The cruelty of Maximin was derived from a different source the fear of contempt Though he depended on the attachment of the soldiers who loved him for virtues like their own he was conscious that his mean and barbarian origin his savage appearance and his total ignorance of the arts and institutions of civil life  It appears that he was totally ignorant of the Greek language which from its universal use in conversation and letters was an essential part of every liberal education  formed a very unfavourable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander He remembered that in his humbler fortune he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome and had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves He recollected too the friendship of a few who had relieved his poverty and assisted his rising hopes But those who had spurned and those who had protected the Thracian were guilty of the same crime the knowledge of his original obscurity For this crime many were put to death and by the execution of several of his benefactors Maximin published in characters of blood the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude  Hist August p Herodian l vii p The latter of these historians has been most unjustly censured for sparing the vices of Maximin    The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most distinguished by their birth or merit Whenever he was alarmed  with the sound of treason his cruelty was unbounded and unrelenting A conspiracy against his life was either discovered or imagined and Magnus a consular senator was named as the principal author of it Without a witness without a trial and without an opportunity of defence Magnus with four thousand of his supposed accomplices were put to death Italy and the whole empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers On the slightest accusation the first of the Roman nobles who had governed provinces commanded armies and been adorned with the consular and triumphal ornaments were chained on the public carriages and hurried away to the emperor's presence Confiscation exile or simple death were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity Some of the unfortunate sufferers he ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaughtered animals others to be exposed to wild beasts others again to be beaten to death with clubs During the three years of his reign he disdained to visit either Rome or Italy His camp occasionally removed from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Danube was the seat of his stern despotism which trampled on every principle of law and justice and was supported by the avowed power of the sword  The wife of Maximin by insinuating wise counsels with female gentleness sometimes brought back the tyrant to the way of truth and humanity See Ammianus Marcellinus l xiv c where he alludes to the fact which he had more fully related under the reign of the Gordians We may collect from the medals that Paullina was the name of this benevolent empress and from the title of  Diva  that she died before Maximin Valesius ad loc cit Ammian Spanheim de U et P N tom ii p  No man  of noble birth elegant accomplishments or knowledge of civil business was

the court or army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune the body of the people viewed their sufferings with indifference or perhaps with pleasure But the tyrant's avarice stimulated by the insatiate desires of the soldiers at length attacked the public property Every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue destined to purchase corn for the multitude and to supply the expences of the games and entertainments By a single act of authority the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for the use of the Imperial treasury The temples were stripped of their most valuable offerings of gold and silver and the statues of gods heroes and emperors were melted down and coined into money These impious orders could not be executed without tumults and massacres as in many places the people chose rather to die in the defence of their altars than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the rapine and cruelty of war The soldiers themselves among whom this sacrilegious plunder was distributed received it with a  blush and hardened as they were in acts of violence they dreaded the just reproaches of their friends and relations Throughout the Roman world a general cry of indignation was heard imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind and at length by an act of private oppression a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against him  Herodian l vii p Zosim l i p    The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy  Revolt in Africa A D April  of such a master who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one of the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue An iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that country the execution of which would have stripped them

the rapacious treasurer was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes The leaders of the conspiracy as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments and by the assistance of their tumultuary train seized on the little town of Thysdrus  In the fertile territory of Byzacium one hundred and fifty miles to the south of Carthage This city was decorated probably by the Gordians with the title of colony and with a fine amphitheatre which is still in a very perfect state See Itinerar Wesseling p and Shaw's Travels p  and erected the standard  of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman empire They rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against Maximin and they judiciously resolved to oppose to that detested tyrant an emperor whose mild virtues had already acquired the love and esteem of the Romans and whose authority over the province would give weight and stability to the enterprise Gordianus their proconsul and the object of their choice refused with unfeigned reluctance the dangerous honour and begged with tears that they would suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life without staining his feeble age with civil blood Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of Maximin since according to the reasoning of tyrants those who have been esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death and those who deliberate have already rebelled  Herodian l vii p Hist August p    The family of Gordianus was one of the most  Character and elevation of the two Gordians  illustrious of the Roman senate On the father's side he was descended from the Gracchi on his mother's from the emperor Trajan A great estate enabled him to support the dignity of his birth and in the enjoyment of it he displayed an

celebrated house of Pompey  in carinis  was usurped by Marc Antony and consequently became after the Triumvir's death a part of the Imperial domain The emperor Trajan allowed and even encouraged the rich senators to purchase those magnificent and useless places Plin Panegyric c and it may seem probable that on this occasion Pompey's house came into the possession of Gordian's great grandfather

extended during his consulship to the principal  cities of Italy He was twice elevated to the last mentioned dignity by Caracalla and by Alexander for he possessed the uncommon talent of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes without alarming the jealousy of tyrants His long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peaceful honours of Rome and till he was named proconsul of Africa by the voice of the senate and the approbation of Alexander  See the original letter in the Augustan History p which at once shews Alexander's respect for the authority of the senate and his esteem for the proconsul appointed by that assembly  he appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the government of provinces As long as that emperor lived Africa was happy under the administration of his worthy representative after the barbarous Maximin had usurped the throne Gordianus alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent When he reluctantly accepted the purple he was above fourscore years old a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines whose virtues he revived in his own conduct and celebrated in an elegant poem of thirty books With the venerable proconsul his son who had accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant was likewise declared emperor His manners were less pure but his character was equally amiable with that of his father Twentytwo acknowledged concubines and a library of sixtytwo thousand volumes attested the variety of his inclinations and from the productions which he left behind  him it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation  By each of his concubines the younger Gordian left three or four children His literary productions though less numerous were by no means contemptible  The Roman people acknowledged in the features of the younger Gordian the resemblance of Scipio Africanus recollected with pleasure that his mother was the granddaughter of Antoninus Pius and rested the public hope on those latent virtues which had hitherto as they fondly imagined lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of a private life  As soon as the Gordians had

were induced by principle as well as interest to solicit the approbation of the senate and a deputation of the noblest provincials was sent without delay to Rome to relate and justify the conduct of their countrymen who having long suffered with patience were at length resolved to act with vigour The letters of the new princes were modest and respectful excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the Imperial title but submitting their election  and their fate to the supreme judgment of the senate  Herodian l vii p Hist August p    The inclinations of the senate were neither

fortune had created many dependants in that assembly their merit had acquired many friends Their mild administration opened the flattering prospect of the restoration not only of the civil but even of the republican government The terror of military violence which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder of Alexander and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant  Quod tamen patres dum periculosum existimant inermes armato resistere approbaverunt  Aurelius Victor  now produced a contrary effect and provoked them to assert the injured rights of freedom and humanity The hatred of Maximin towards the senate was declared and implacable the tamest submission had not appeased his fury the most cautious innocence would not remove his suspicions and even the care of their own safety urged them to share the fortune of an enterprise of which if unsuccessful they were sure to be the first victims These considerations and perhaps others of a more private nature were debated in a previous conference of the consuls and the magistrates As soon as their resolution was decided they convoked in the temple of Castor the whole body of the senate  according to an ancient form of

authority of the senate and the lives of the senators from a state of danger and suspence Before their resolves had transpired a quaestor and some tribunes were commissioned to take his devoted life They executed the order with equal boldness and success and with their bloody daggers in their hands ran through the streets proclaiming to the people and the soldiers the news of the happy revolution

provinces earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of their country and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of friendship with the Roman senate and people The general respect with which these deputies were received and the zeal of Italy and the provinces in favour of the senate sufficiently prove that the subjects of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon distress in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression than from resistance The consciousness of that melancholy truth inspires a degree of persevering fury seldom to be found in those civil wars which

cautious dilatory measures had been long since out of their power that Maximin implacable by nature  and exasperated by injuries was advancing towards Italy at the head of the military force of the empire and that their only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the field or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful rebellion  We have lost

eloquence of Cicero see Orat pro Cornel Balbo The friendship of Caesar to whom he rendered the most important secret services in the civil war raised him to the consulship and the pontificate honours

multitude neither loved the rigid Maximus nor did they sufficiently fear the mild and humane Balbinus Their increasing numbers surrounded the temple of Jupiter with obstinate clamours they asserted their inherent right of consenting to the election of their sovereign and demanded with an apparent moderation that besides the two emperors chosen by the senate a third should be added of the family of the Gordians as a just return of gratitude to those princes who had sacrificed their lives for the republic At the head of the cityguards and the youth of the equestrian order Maximus and Balbinus

issue of it must be fatal to both parties A boy only thirteen years of age the grandson of the elder and nephew of the younger Gordian was produced to the people invested with the ornaments and title

itself on the distant senate threatened the life of his son of his friends and of all who ventured to approach his person The grateful intelligence of the death of the Gordians was quickly followed by the assurance that the senate laying aside all hopes of pardon or accommodation had substituted in their room two emperors with whose merit he could not be unacquainted Revenge was the only consolation left to Maximin and revenge could only be obtained by arms The strength of the legions had been assembled by Alexander  from all parts of the empire Three successful campaigns against the Germans and the Sarmatians had raised their fame confirmed their discipline and even increased their numbers by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian youth The life of Maximin had been

several orations of Maximin to his army on the rebellion of Africa and Rome M de Tillemont has very justly observed that they neither agree with each other nor with truth Histoire des Empereurs tom iii p  It might naturally be expected that a prince of such a character instead of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay should immediately have marched from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber and that his victorious army instigated by contempt for the senate and eager to gather the spoils of Italy should have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative conquest Yet as far as we can trust to the obscure chronology of that period  The carelessness of the writers of that age leaves us in a singular perplexity We know that Maximus and Balbinus were killed during the Capitoline games Herodian l viii p The authority of Censorinus de Die Natali c enables us to fix those games with certainty to the year but leaves us in ignorance of the month or day The election of Gordian by the senate is fixed with equal certainty to the th of May but we are at a loss to discover whether it was in the same or the preceding year Tillemont and Muratori who maintain the two opposite opinions bring into the field a desultory troop of authorities conjectures and probabilities The one seems to draw out the other to contract the series of events between those periods more than can be well reconciled to reason and history Yet it is necessary to chuse between them  it appears that  the operations of some foreign war deferred the Italian expedition till the ensuing spring From the prudent conduct of Maximin we may learn that the savage features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of party that his passions however impetuous submitted to the force of reason and that the barbarian possessed something of the generous spirit of Sylla who subdued the enemies of Rome before he suffered himself to revenge his private injuries  Velleius Paterculus l ii c The president de Montesquieu in his dialogue between Sylla and Eucrates expresses the sentiments of the dictator in a spirited and even a sublime manner    When the troops of Maximin advancing in  Marches into Italy A D February  excellent order arrived at the foot of the Julian Alps they were terrified by the silence and desolation that reigned on the frontiers of Italy The villages and open towns had been abandoned on their approach by the inhabitants the cattle was driven away the provisions removed or destroyed the bridges broke down nor was any thing left which could afford either shelter or subsistence to an invader Such had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate whose design was to protract the war to ruin the army of Maximin by the slow operation of famine and to consume his strength in the sieges of the principal cities of Italy which they had plentifully stored with men and provisions from the deserted country Aquileia received and withstood the  Siege of Aquileia  first shock of the invasion The streams that issue from the head of the Hadriatic gulf swelled  by the melting of the winter snows  Muratori Annali d'Italia tom ii p thinks the melting of the snows suits better with the months of June or July than with those of February The opinion of a man who passed his life between the Alps and the Appennines is undoubtedly of great weight yet I observe That the long winter of which Muratori takes advantage is to be found only in the Latin version and not in the Greek text of Herodian That the vicissitude of suns and rains to which the soldiers of Maximin were exposed Herodian l viii p denotes the spring rather than the summer We may observe likewise that these several streams as they melted into one composed the Timavus so poetically in every sense of the word described by Virgil They are about twelve miles to the east of Aquileia See Cluyer Italia Antiqua tom i p c  opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms of Maximin At length on a singular bridge constructed with art and difficulty of large hogsheads he transported his army to the opposite bank rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neighbourhood of Aquileia demolished the suburbs and employed the timber of the buildings in the engines and towers with which on every side he attacked the city The walls fallen to decay during the security of a long peace had been hastily repaired on this sudden emergency but the firmest defence of Aquileia consisted in the constancy of the citizens all ranks of whom instead of being dismayed were animated by the extreme danger and their knowledge of the tyrant's unrelenting temper Their courage was supported and directed by Crispinus and Menophilus two of the twenty lieutenants of the senate who with a small body of regular troops had thrown themselves into the besieged place The army of Maximin was repulsed on repeated attacks his machines  destroyed by showers of artificial fire and the generous enthusiasm of the Aquileians was exalted into a confidence of success by the opinion that Belenus their tutelar deity combated in person in the defence of his distressed worshippers  Herodian l viii p The Celtic deity was supposed to be Apollo and received under that name the thanks of the senate A temple was likewise built to Venus the bald in honour of the women of Aquileia who had given up their hair to make ropes for the military engines    The emperor Maximus who had advanced as  Conduct of Maximus  far as Ravenna to secure that important place and to hasten the military preparations beheld the event of the war in the more faithful mirror of reason and policy He was too sensible that a single town could not resist the persevering efforts of a great army and he dreaded lest the enemy tired with the obstinate resistance of Aquileia should on a sudden relinquish the fruitless siege and march directly towards Rome The fate of the empire and the cause of freedom must then be committed to the chance of a battle and what arms could he oppose to the veteran legions of the Rhine and Danube Some troops newly levied among the generous but enervated youth of Italy and a body of German auxiliaries on whose firmness in the hour of trial it was dangerous to depend In the midst of these just alarms the stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes of Maximin and delivered Rome and the senate from the calamities that would surely have attended the victory of an enraged barbarian  The people of Aquileia had scarcely experienced any of the common miseries of a siege their magazines were plentifully supplied and  Murder of Maximin and his son A D April  several fountains within the walls assured them of an inexhaustible resource of fresh water The soldiers of Maximin were on the contrary exposed to the inclemency of the season the contagion of disease and the horrors of famine The open country was ruined the rivers filled with the slain and polluted with blood A spirit of despair and disaffection began to diffuse itself among the troops and as they were cut off from all intelligence they easily believed that the whole empire had embraced the cause of the senate and that they were left as devoted victims to perish under the impregnable walls of Aquileia The fierce temper of the tyrant was exasperated by disappointments which he imputed to the cowardice of his army and his wanton and illtimed cruelty instead of striking terror inspired hatred and a just desire of revenge A party of Praetorian guards who trembled for their wives and children in the camp of Alba near Rome executed the sentence of the senate Maximin abandoned by his guards was slain in his tent with his son whom he had associated to the honours of the purple Anulinus the praefect and the principal ministers of his tyranny  Herodian l viii p Hist August p The duration of Maximin's reign has not been defined with much accuracy except by Eutropius who allows him three years and a few days l ix we may depend on the integrity of the text as the Latin original is checked by the Greek version of Paeanius  The sight of their heads borne  on the point of spears convinced the citizens of Aquileia that the siege was at an end the gates of the city were thrown open a liberal market was provided for the hungry troops of Maximin and the whole army joined in solemn protestations of fidelity to the senate and the people of Rome and to their lawful emperors Maximus and Balbinus Such was the deserved fate of  His portrait  a brutal savage destitute as he has generally been represented of every sentiment that distinguishes a civilized or even a human being The body was suited to the soul The stature of Maximin exceeded the measure of eight feet and circumstances almost incredible are related of his matchless strength and appetite  Eight Roman feet and one third which are equal to above eight English feet as the two measures are to each other in the proportion of to See Graves's discourse on the Roman foot We are told that Maximin could drink in a day an amphora or about seven gallons of wine and eat thirty or forty pounds of meat He could move a loaded waggon break a horse's leg with his fist crumble stones in his hand and tear up small trees by the roots See his life in the Augustan History  Had he lived in a less enlightened age tradition and poetry might well have described him as one of those monstrous giants whose supernatural power was constantly exerted for the destruction of mankind  It is easier to conceive than to describe the  Joy of the Roman world  universal joy of the Roman world on the fall of the tyrant the news of which is said to have been carried in four days from Aquileia to Rome The return of Maximus was a triumphal procession  his colleague and young Gordian went out to meet him and the three princes made their entry into the capital attended by the ambassadors of almost all the cities of Italy saluted with the splendid offerings of gratitude and superstition and received with the unfeigned acclamations of the senate and people who persuaded themselves that a golden age would succeed to an age of iron  See the congratulatory letter of Claudius Julianus the consul to the two emperors in the Augustan History  The conduct of the two emperors corresponded with these expectations They administered justice in person and the rigour of the one was tempered by the other's clemency The oppressive taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and succession were repealed or at least moderated Discipline was revived and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were enacted by their imperial ministers who endeavoured to restore a civil constitution on the ruins of military tyranny  What reward may we expect for delivering Rome from a monster  was the question asked by Maximus in a moment of freedom and confidence Balbinus answered it without hesitation  The love of the senate of the people and of all mankind  Alas replied his more penetrating colleague Alas I dread the hatred of the soldiers and the fatal effects of their resentment  Hist August p    His apprehensions were but too well justified by the event  Whilst Maximus was preparing to defend Italy against the common foe Balbinus who remained  Sedition at Rome  at Rome had been engaged in scenes of blood and intestine discord Distrust and jealousy reigned in the senate and even in the temples where they assembled every senator carried either open or concealed arms In the midst of their deliberations two veterans of the guards actuated either by curiosity or a sinister motive audaciously thrust themselves into the house and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of Victory Gallicanus a consular and Maecenas a Praetorian senator viewed with indignation their insolent intrusion drawing their daggers they laid the spies for such they deemed them dead at the foot of the altar and then advancing to the door of the senate imprudently exhorted the multitude to massacre the Praetorians as the secret adherents of the tyrant Those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp which they defended with superior advantage against the reiterated attacks of the people assisted by the numerous bands of gladiators the property of opulent nobles The civil war lasted many days with infinite loss and confusion on both sides When the pipes were broken that supplied the camp with water the Praetorians were reduced to intolerable distress but in their turn they made desperate sallies into the city set fire to a great number of houses and filled the streets with the blood of the inhabitants The emperor Balbinus attempted by ineffectual edicts and precarious truces to reconcile  the factions at Rome But their animosity though smothered for a while burnt with redoubled violence The soldiers detesting the senate and the people despised the weakness of a prince who wanted either the spirit or the power to command the obedience of his subjects  Herodian l viii p    After the tyrant's death his formidable army  Discontent of the Praetorian guards  had acknowledged from necessity rather than from choice the authority of Maximus who transported himself without delay to the camp before Aquileia As soon as he had received their oath of fidelity he addressed them in terms full of mildness and moderation lamented rather than arraigned the wild disorders of the times and assured the soldiers that of all their past conduct the senate would remember only their generous desertion of the tyrant and their voluntary return to their duty Maximus enforced his exhortations by a liberal donative purified the camp by a solemn sacrifice of expiation and then dismissed the legions to their several provinces impressed as he hoped with a lively sense of gratitude and obedience  Herodian l viii p  But nothing could reconcile the haughty spirit of the Praetorians They attended the emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into Rome but amidst the general acclamations the sullen dejected countenance of the guards sufficiently declared that they considered themselves as the object rather than the partners of the triumph When the whole body was united in their camp those who had served under Maximin and those  who had remained at Rome insensibly communicated to each other their complaints and apprehensions The emperors chosen by the army had perished with ignominy those elected by the senate were seated on the throne  The observation had been made imprudently enough in the acclamations of the senate and with regard to the soldiers it carried the appearance of a wanton insult Hist August p  The long discord between the civil and military powers was decided by a war in which the former had obtained a complete victory The soldiers must now learn a new doctrine of submission to the senate and whatever clemency was affected by that politic assembly they dreaded a slow revenge coloured by the name of discipline and justified by fair pretences of the public good But their fate was still in their own hands and if they had courage to despise the vain terrors of an impotent republic it was easy to convince the world that those who were masters of the arms were masters of the authority of the state  When the senate elected two princes it is  Massacre of Maximus and Balbinus  probable that besides the declared reason of providing for the various emergencies of peace and war they were actuated by the secret desire of weakening by division the despotism of the supreme magistrate Their policy was effectual but it proved fatal both to their emperors and to themselves The jealousy of power was soon exasperated by the difference of character Maximus despised Balbinus as a luxurious noble and was in his turn disdained by his colleague as an  obscure soldier Their silent discord was understood rather than seen  Discordiae tacitae et quae intelligerentur potius quam viderentur  Hist August  p This wellchosen expression is probably stolen from some better writer  but the mutual consciousness prevented them from uniting in any vigorous measures of defence against their common enemies of the Praetorian camp The whole city was employed in the Capitoline games and the emperors were left almost alone in the palace On a sudden they were alarmed  A D July  by the approach of a troop of desperate assassins Ignorant of each other's situation or designs for they already occupied very distant apartments afraid to give or to receive assistance they wasted the important moments in idle debates and fruitless recriminations The arrival of the guards put an end to the vain strife They seized on these emperors of the senate for such they called them with malicious contempt stripped them of their garments and dragged them in insolent triumph through the streets of Rome with a design of inflicting a slow and cruel death on these unfortunate princes The fear of a rescue from the faithful Germans of the Imperial guards shortened their tortures and their bodies mangled with a

expression of the Augustan History  They carried him to the camp and unanimously saluted him Augustus and Emperor His name was dear to the senate and people his tender age promised a long impunity of military licence and the submission of Rome and the provinces to the choice of the Praetorian guards saved the republic at the expence indeed of its freedom and dignity from the horrors of a new civil war in the heart of the capital  Quintus Curtius l x c pays an elegant compliment to the emperor of the day for having by his happy accession extinguished so many firebrands sheathed so many swords and put an end to the evils of a divided government After weighing with attention every word of the passage I am of opinion that it suits better with the elevation of Gordian than with any other period of the Roman History In that case it may serve to decide the age of Quintus Curtius Those who place him under the first Caesars argue from the purity of his style but are embarrassed by the silence of Quintilian in his accurate list of Roman historians    As the third Gordian was only nineteen years  Innocence and virtues of Gordian  of age at the time of his death the history of his life were it known to us with greater accuracy than it really is would contain little more than the account of his education and the conduct of the ministers who by turns abused or guided the simplicity of his unexperienced youth Immediately after his accession he fell into the hands of  his mother's eunuchs that pernicious vermin of the East who since the days of Elagabalus had infested the Roman palace By the artful conspiracy of these wretches an impenetrable veil was drawn between an innocent prince and his oppressed subjects the virtuous disposition of Gordian was deceived and the honours of the empire sold without his knowledge though in a very public manner to the most worthless of mankind We are ignorant by what fortunate accident the emperor escaped from this ignominious slavery and devolved his confidence on a minister whose wise counsels had no object except the glory of his sovereign and the happiness of the people It should seem that love and learning  A D Administration of Misitheus  introduced Misitheus to the favour of Gordian The young prince married the daughter of his master of rhetoric and promoted his fatherinlaw to the first offices of the empire Two admirable letters that passed between them are still extant The minister with the conscious dignity of virtue congratulates Gordian that he is delivered from the tyranny of the eunuchs  Hist August p From some hints in the two letters I should expect that the eunuchs were not expelled the palace without some degree of gentle violence and that young Gordian rather approved of than consented to their disgrace  and still more that he is sensible of his deliverance The emperor acknowledges with an amiable confusion the errors of his past conduct and laments with singular propriety the misfortune of a monarch from whom a venal tribe of  courtiers perpetually labour to conceal the truth  Duxit uxorem filiam Misithei quem causÃ¢ eloquentiae dignum parentela suÃ¢ putavit et

was the versatile genius of that great man that when he was appointed Praetorian Praefect he discharged the military duties of his place with vigour and ability The Persians had invaded Mesopotamia and threatened Antioch By the persuasion of his fatherinlaw the young emperor quitted the luxury of Rome opened for the last time recorded in history the temple of Janus and marched in person into the East On his approach with a great army the Persians withdrew their garrisons from the cities which they had already taken and retired from the Euphrates to the Tigris Gordian enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the senate the first success of his arms which he ascribed with a becoming modesty and gratitude to the wisdom of his father and Praefect During the whole expedition Misitheus watched over the safety and discipline of the army whilst he prevented their dangerous murmurs by maintaining a regular plenty in the camp and by establishing ample magazines of vinegar bacon straw barley and wheat in all the cities of the frontier  Hist August p Aurelius Victor Porphyrius in Vit Plotin ap Fabricium Biblioth Graec l iv c The philosopher Plotinus accompanied the army prompted by the love of knowledge and by the hope of penetrating as far as India  But the prosperity  of Gordian expired with Misitheus who died of a flux not without very strong suspicions of poison Philip his successor in the praefecture was  A D Arts of Philip  an Arab by birth and consequently in the earlier part of his life a robber by profession His rise from so obscure a station to the first dignities of the empire seems to prove that he was a bold and able leader But his boldness prompted him to aspire to the throne and his abilities were employed to supplant not to serve his indulgent master The minds of the soldiers were irritated by an artificial scarcity created by his contrivance in the camp and the distress of the army was attributed to the youth and incapacity of the prince It is not in our

Aurelius Victor Eutrop ix Orosius vii Ammianus Marcellinus xxiii Zosimus l i p Philip who was a native of Bostra was about forty years of age    We cannot forbear transcribing the ingenious  Form of a military republic  though somewhat fanciful description which a  celebrated writer of our own times has traced of the military government of the Roman empire  What in that age was called the Roman empire was only an irregular republic not unlike the Aristocracy  Can the epithet of  Aristocracy  be applied with any propriety to the government of Algiers Every military government floats between the extremes of absolute monarchy and wild democracy  of Algiers  The military republic of the Mamalukes in Egypt would have afforded M de Montesquieu see Considerations sur la Grandeur et la Decadence des Romains c a juster and more noble parallel  where the militia possessed of the sovereignty creates and deposes a magistrate who is styled a Dey Perhaps indeed it may be laid down as a general rule that a military government is in some respects more republican than monarchical Nor can it be said that the soldiers only partook of the government by their disobedience and rebellions The speeches made to them by the emperors were they not at length of the same nature as those formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the tribunes And although the armies had no regular place or forms of assembly though their debates were short their action sudden and their resolves seldom the result of cool reflection did they not dispose with absolute sway of the public fortune What was the emperor except the minister of a violent government elected for the private benefit of the soldiers  When the army had elected Philip who was Praetorian praefect to the third Gordian the  latter demanded that he might remain sole emperor he was unable to obtain it He requested that the power might be equally divided between them the army would not listen to his speech He consented to be degraded to the rank of Caesar the favour was refused him He desired at least he might be appointed Praetorian praefect his prayer was rejected Finally he pleaded for his life The army in these several judgments exercised the supreme magistracy  According to the historian whose doubtful narrative the president De Montesquieu has adopted Philip who during the whole transaction had preserved a sullen silence was inclined to spare the innocent life of his benefactor till recollecting that his innocence might excite a dangerous compassion in the Roman world he commanded without regard to his suppliant cries that he should be seized stript and led away to instant death After a moment's pause the inhuman sentence was executed  The Augustan History p cannot in this instance be reconciled with itself or with probability How could Philip condemn his predecessor and yet consecrate his memory How could he order his public execution and yet in his letters to the senate exculpate himself from the guilt of his death Philip though an ambitious usurper was by no means a mad tyrant Some chronological difficulties have likewise been discovered by the nice eyes of Tillemont and Muratori in this supposed association of Philip to the empire    On his return from the east to Rome Philip  Reign of Philip  desirous of obliterating the memory of his crimes and of captivating the affections of the people  solemnized the secular games with infinite pomp and magnificence Since their institution or revival by Augustus  The account of the last supposed celebration though in an enlightened period of history was so very doubtful and obscure that the alternative seems not doubtful When the popish jubilees the copy of the secular games were invented by Boniface VIII the crafty pope pretended that he only revived an ancient institution See M le Chais Lettres sur les JubilÃ¨s  they had been celebrated by Claudius by Domitian and by Severus and were now renewed the fifth time on the accomplishment of the full period of a thousand years from the foundation of Rome Every circumstance  Secular games A D April  of the secular games was skilfully adapted to inspire the superstitious mind with deep and solemn reverence The long interval between them  Either of a hundred or a hundred and ten years Varro and Livy adopted the former opinion but the infallible authority of the Sibyl consecrated the latter Censorinus de Die Natal c The emperors Claudius and Philip however did not treat the oracle with implicit respect  exceeded the term of human life and as none of the spectators had already seen them none could flatter themselves with the expectation of beholding them a second time The mystic sacrifices were performed during three nights on the banks of the Tyber and the Campus Martius resounded with music and dances and was illuminated with innumerable lamps and torches Slaves and strangers were excluded from any participation in these national ceremonies A chorus of twentyseven youths and as many virgins of noble families and whose parents were both alive implored the propitious gods in favour of the present and for the hope  of the rising generation requesting in religious hymns that according to the faith of their ancient oracles they would still maintain the virtue the felicity and the empire of the Roman people  The idea of the secular games is best understood from the poem of Horace and the description of Zosimus l ii p c  The magnificence of Philip's shows and entertainments dazzled the eyes of the multitude The devout were employed in the rites of superstition whilst the reflecting few revolved in their anxious minds the past history and the future fate of the empire  Since Romulus with a small band of shepherds  Decline of the Roman empire  and outlaws fortified himself on the hills near the Tiber ten centuries had already elapsed  The received calculation of Varro assigns to the foundation of Rome an aera that corresponds with the th year before Christ But so little is the chronology of Rome to be depended on in the more early ages that Sir Isaac Newton has brought the same event as low as the year  During the four first ages the Romans in the laborious school of poverty had acquired the virtues of war and government By the vigorous exertion of those virtues and by the assistance of fortune they had obtained in the course of the three succeeding centuries an absolute empire over many countries of Europe Asia and Africa The last three hundred years had been consumed in apparent prosperity and internal decline The nation of soldiers magistrates and legislators who composed the thrityfive tribes of the Roman people was dissolved into the common mass of mankind and confounded with the millions of servile provincials who had received the name  without adopting the spirit of Romans A mercenary army levied among the subjects and barbarians of the frontier was the only order of men who preserved and abused their independence By their tumultuary election a Syrian a Goth or an Arab was exalted to the throne of Rome and invested with despotic power over the conquests and over the country of the Scipios  The limits of the Roman empire still extended from the Western Ocean to the Tigris and from Mount Atlas to the Rhine and the Danube To the undiscerning eye of the vulgar Philip appeared a monarch no less powerful than Hadrian or Augustus had formerly been The form was still the same but the animating health and vigour were fled The industry of the people was discouraged and exhausted by a long series of oppression The discipline of the legions which alone after the extinction of every other virtue had propped the greatness of the state was corrupted by the ambition or relaxed by the weakness of the emperors The strength of the frontiers which had always consisted in arms rather than in fortifications was insensibly undermined and the fairest provinces were left exposed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbarians who soon discovered the decline of the Roman empire  CHAP VIII  Of the State of Persia after the Restoration of the Monarchy by Artaxerxes  WHENEVER Tacitus indulges himself in those beautiful episodes in which he relates some domestic transaction of the Germans  The barbarians of the East and of the North  or of the Parthians his principal object is to relieve the attention of the reader from a uniform scene of vice and misery From the reign of Augustus to the time of Alexander Severus the enemies of Rome were in her bosom the tyrants and the soldiers and her prosperity had a very distant and feeble interest in the revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates But when the military order had levelled in wild anarchy the power of the prince the laws of the senate and even the discipline of the camp the barbarians of the north and of the east who had long hovered on the frontier boldly attacked the provinces of a declining monarchy Their vexatious inroads were changed into formidable irruptions and after a long vicissitude of mutual calamities many tribes of the victorious invaders established themselves in the provinces of the Roman empire To obtain a clearer knowledge of these great events we shall endeavour to form a previous idea of the character forces and designs of those nations who avenged the cause of Hannibal and Mithridates  In the more early ages of the world whilst the forest that covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages the inhabitants of Asia  Revolutions of Asia  were already collected into populous cities and reduced under extensive empires the seat of the arts of luxury and of despotism The Assyrians reigned over the east  An ancient chronologist quoted by Velleius Paterculus l i c observes that the Assyrians the Medes the Persians and the Macedonians reigned over Asia one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive years from the accession of Ninus to the defeat of Antiochus by the Romans As the latter of these great events happened years before Christ the former may be placed years before the same aera The Astronomical Observations found at Babylon by Alexander went fifty years higher  till the sceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropt from the hands of their enervated successors The Medes and the Babylonians divided their power and were themselves swallowed up in the monarchy of the Persians whose arms could not be confined within the narrow limits of Asia Followed as it is said by two millions of  men  Xerxes the descendant of Cyrus invaded Greece Thirty thousand  soldiers  under the command of Alexander the son of Philip who was intrusted by the Greeks with their glory and revenge were sufficient to subdue Persia The princes of the house of Seleucus usurped and lost the Macedonian command over the East About the same time that by an ignominious treaty they resigned to the Romans the country on this side Mount Taurus they were driven by the Parthians an obscure horde of Scythian origin from all the provinces of Upper Asia The formidable power of the Parthians  which spread from India to the frontiers of Syria was in its turn subverted by Ardshir or Artaxerxes the founder of a new dynasty which under the name of Sassanides governed Persia till the invasion of the Arabs This great revolution whose fatal influence was soon experienced by the Romans happened in the fourth year of Alexander Severus two hundred and twentysix years after the Christian aera  In the five hundred and thirtyeighth year of the aera of Seleucus See Agathias l ii p This great event such is the carelessness of the Orientals is placed by Eutychius as high as the tenth year of Commodus and by Moses of

of Europe and Asia had mutually adopted  and corrupted each other's superstitions The Arsacides indeed practised the worship of the Magi but they disgraced and polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry The memory of Zoroaster the ancient prophet and philosopher of the Persians  Hyde and Prideaux working up the Persian legends and their own conjectures into a very agreeable story represent Zoroaster as a contemporary of Darius Hystaspes But it is sufficient to observe that the Greek writers who lived almost in the age of Darius agree in placing the aera of Zoroaster many hundred or even thousand years before their own time The judicious criticism of Mr Moyle perceived and maintained against his uncle Dr Prideaux the antiquity of the Persian prophet See his work vol ii  was still revered in the East but the obsolete and mysterious language in which the Zendavesta was composed  That ancient idiom was called the  Zend  The language of the commentary the Pehlvi though much more modern has ceased many ages ago to be a living tongue This fact alone if it is allowed as authentic sufficiently warrants the antiquity of those writings which M d'Anquetil has brought into

but holy prelate received from the hands of his brethren three cups of soporiferous wine He drank them off and instantly fell into a long and profound sleep As soon as he waked he related to the king and to the believing multitude his journey to Heaven and his intimate conferences with the Deity Every doubt was silenced by this supernatural evidence and the articles of the faith of Zoroaster were fixed with equal authority and precision  Hyde de Religione veterum Pers c  A short delineation of that celebrated system will be found useful not only to display the character of the Persian nation but to illustrate many of their most important transactions both in peace and war with the Roman empire  I have principally drawn this account from the Zendavesta of M d'Anquetil and the Sadder subjoined to Dr Hyde's treatise It must however be confessed that the studied obscurity of a prophet the figurative style of the East and the deceitful medium of a French or Latin version may have betrayed us into error and heresy in this abridgement of Persian theology    The great and fundamental article of the system  Persian theology two principles  was the celebrated doctrine of the two principles a bold and injudicious attempt of Eastern philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral  and physical evil with the attributes of a beneficent Creator and Governor of the world The first and original Being in whom or by whom the universe exists is denominated in the writings of Zoroaster  Time without bounds  but it must be confessed that this infinite substance seems rather a metaphysical abstraction of the mind than a real object endowed with selfconsciousness or possessed of moral perfections From either the blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite Time which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the Greeks the two secondary but active principles of the universe were from all eternity produced Ormusd and Ahriman each of them possessed of the powers of creation but each disposed by his invariable nature to exercise them with different designs The principle of good is eternally absorbed in light the principle of evil eternally buried in darkness The wise benevolence of Ormusd formed man capable of virtue and abundantly provided his fair habitation with the materials of happiness By his vigilant providence the motion of the planets the order of the seasons and the temperate mixture of the elements are preserved But the malice of Ahriman has long since pierced  Ormusd's egg  or in other words has violated the harmony of his works Since that fatal irruption the most minute articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated together the rankest poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants deluges earthquakes and  conflagrations attest the conflict of Nature and the little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune Whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chains of their infernal enemy the faithful Persian alone reserves his religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd and fights under his banner of light in the full confidence that he shall in the last day share the glory of his triumph At that decisive period the enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power of Ormusd superior to the furious malice of his rival Ahriman and his followers disarmed and subdued will sink into their native darkness and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the universe  The modern Persees and in some degree the Sadder exalt Ormusd into the first and omnipotent cause whilst they degrade Ahriman into an inferior but rebellious spirit Their desire of pleasing the Mahometans may have contributed to refine their theological system    The theology of Zoroaster was darkly comprehended  Religious worship  by foreigners and even by the far greater number of his disciples but the most careless observers were struck with the philosophic simplicity of the Persian worship  That people says Herodotus  Herodotus l i c But Dr Prideaux thinks with reason that the use of temples was afterwards permitted in the Magian religion  rejects the use of temples of altars and of statues and smiles at the folly of those nations who imagine that the gods are sprung from or bear any affinity with the human nature The tops of the highest mountains  are the places chosen for sacrifices Hymns and prayers are the principal worship the Supreme God who fills the wide circle of Heaven is the object to whom they are addressed  Yet at the same time in the true spirit of a polytheist he accuses them of adoring Earth Water Fire the Winds and the Sun and Moon But the Persians of every age have denied the charge and explained the equivocal conduct which might appear to give a colour to it The elements and more particularly Fire Light and the Sun whom they called Mithra were the objects of their religious reverence because they considered them as the purest symbols the noblest productions and the most powerful agents of the Divine Power and Nature  Hyde de Relig Pers c Notwithstanding all their distinctions and protestations which seem sincere enough their tyrants the Mahometans have constantly stigmatised them as idolatrous worshippers of the Fire    Every mode of religion to make a deep and lasting impression on the human mind must exercise  Ceremonies and moral precepts  our obedience by enjoining practices of devotion for which we can assign no reason and must acquire our esteem by inculcating moral duties analogous to the dictates of our own hearts The religion of Zoroaster was abundantly provided with the former and possessed a sufficient portion of the latter At the age of puberty the faithful Persian was invested with a mysterious girdle the badge of the divine protection and from that moment all the actions of his life even the most indifferent or the most necessary  were sanctified by their peculiar prayers ejaculations or genuflexions the omission of which under any circumstances was a grievous sin not inferior in guilt to the violation of the moral duties The moral duties however of justice mercy liberality c were in their turn required of the disciple of Zoroaster who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman and to live with Ormusd in a blissful eternity where the degree of felicity will be exactly proportioned to the degree of virtue and piety  See the Sadder the smallest part of which consists of moral precepts The ceremonies enjoined are infinite and trifling Fifteen genuflexions prayers c were required whenever the devout Persian cut his nails or made water or as often as he put on the sacred girdle Sadder Art    But there are some remarkable instances in  Encouragement of agriculture  which Zoroaster lays aside the prophet assumes the legislator and discovers a liberal concern for private and public happiness seldom to be found among the groveling or visionary schemes of superstition Fasting and celibacy the common means of purchasing the Divine favour he condemns with abhorrence as a criminal rejection of the best gifts of Providence The saint in the Magian religion is obliged to beget children to plant useful trees to destroy noxious animals to convey water to the dry lands of Persia and to work out his salvation by pursuing all the labours of agriculture We may quote from the Zendavesta a wise and benevolent maxim which compensates for many an absurdity  He who sows the ground with  care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers  Zendavesta tom i p and Precis du Systeme de Zoroastre tom iii    In the spring of every year a festival was celebrated destined to represent the primitive equality and the present connexion of mankind The stately kings of Persia exchanging their vain pomp for more genuine greatness freely mingled with the humblest but most useful of their subjects On that day the husbandmen were admitted without distinction to the table of the king and his satraps The monarch accepted their petitions inquired into their grievances and conversed with them on the most equal terms  From your labours was he accustomed to say and to say with truth if not with sincerity from your labours we receive our subsistence you derive your tranquility from our vigilance since therefore we are mutually necessary to each other let us live together like brothers in concord and love  Religione Persarum c    Such a festival must indeed have degenerated in a wealthy and despotic empire into a theatrical representation but it was at least a comedy well worthy of a royal audience and which might sometimes imprint a salutary lesson on the mind of a young prince  Had Zoroaster in all his institutions invariably  Power of the Magi  supported this exalted character his name would deserve a place with those of Numa and  Confucius and his system would be justly entitled to all the applause which it has pleased some of our Divines and even some of our philosophers to bestow on it But in that motley composition dictated by reason and passion by enthusiasm and by selfish motives some useful and sublime truths were disgraced by a mixture of the most abject and dangerous superstition The Magi or sacerdotal order were extremely numerous since as we have already seen fourscore thousand of them were convened in a general council Their forces were multiplied by discipline A regular hierarchy was diffused through all the provinces of Persia and the Archimagus who resided at Balch was respected as the visible head of the church and the lawful successor of Zoroaster  Hyde de Religione Persarum c Both Hyde and Prideaux affect to apply to the Magian the terms consecrated to the Christian hierarchy  The property of the Magi was very considerable Besides the less invidious possession of a large tract of the most fertile lands of Media  Ammian Marcellin xxiii He informs us as far as we may credit him of two curious particulars that the Magi derived some of their most secret doctrines from the Indian Brachmans and that they were a tribe or family as well as order  they levied a general tax on the fortunes and the industry of the Persians  The divine institution of tythes exhibits a singular instance of conformity between the law of Zoroaster and that of Moses Those who cannot otherwise account for it may suppose if they please that the Magi of the latter times inserted so useful an interpolation into the writings of their prophet    Though your good works says the interested prophet exceed in number the leaves of the  trees the drops of rain the stars in the heaven or the sands on the seashore they will all be unprofitable to you unless they are accepted by the  destour  or priest To obtain the acceptation of this guide to salvation you must faithfully pay him  tythes  of all you possess of your goods of your lands and of your money If the destour be satisfied your soul will escape hell tortures you will secure praise in this world and happiness in the next For the destours are the teachers of religion they know all things and they deliver all men  Sadder Art    These convenient maxims of reverence and implicit faith were doubtless imprinted with care on the tender minds of youth since the Magi were the masters of education in Persia and to their hands the children even of the royal family were intrusted  Plato in Alcibiad  The Persian priests who were of a speculative genius preserved and investigated the secrets of Oriental philosophy and acquired either by superior knowledge or superior art the reputation of being well versed in some occult sciences which have derived their appellation from the Magi  Pliny Hist Natur l xxx c observes that magic held mankind by the triple chain of religion of physic and of astronomy  Those of more active dispositions mixed with the world in courts and cities and it is observed that the administration of Artaxerxes was in a great measure directed by the counsels of the sacerdotal order whose dignity either from policy or devotion that prince restored to its ancient splendour  Agathias l iv p    The first counsel of the Magi was agreeable to the unsociable genius of their faith  Mr Hume in the Natural History of Religion sagaciously remarks that the most refined and philosophic sects are constantly the most intolerant  to the practice of ancient kings  Cicero de Legibus ii Xerxes by the advice of the Magi destroyed the temples of Greece  and even to the example  Spirit of persecution  of their legislator who had fallen a victim to a religious war excited by his own intolerant zeal

make use of these passages  The sword of Aristotle such was the name given by the Orientals to the polytheism and philosophy of the Greeks was easily broken  Rabbi Abraham in the Tarikh Schickard p

as a Christian heretic  nor did they spare the heretics of their own nation and religion The majesty of Ormusd who was jealous of a rival was seconded by the despotism of Artaxerxes who could not suffer a rebel and the schismatics within his vast empire were soon reduced to the inconsiderable number of eighty thousand  Hyde de Religione Persar c  This spirit  of persecution reflects dishonour on the religion of Zoroaster but as it was not productive of any civil commotion it served to strengthen the new monarchy by uniting all the various inhabitants of Persia in the bands of religious zeal  II Artaxerxes by his valour and conduct  Establishment of the royal authority in the provinces  had wrested the sceptre of the East from the ancient royal family of Parthia There still remained the more difficult task of establishing throughout the vast extent of Persia a uniform and vigorous administration The weak indulgence of the Arsacides had resigned to their sons and brothers the principal provinces and the greatest offices of the kingdom in the nature of hereditary possessions The  vitaxae  or eighteen most powerful satraps were permitted to assume the regal title and the vain pride of the monarch was delighted with a nominal dominion over so many vassal kings Even tribes of barbarians in their mountains and the Greek cities of Upper Asia  These colonies were extremely numerous Seleucus Nicator founded thirtynine cities all named from himself or some of his relations see Appian in Syriac p The aera of Seleucus still in use among the Eastern Christians appears as late as the year of Christ on the medals of the Greek cities within the Parthian empire See Moyle's works vol i p c and M Freret Mem de l'Academie tom xix  within their walls scarcely acknowledged or seldom obeyed any superior and the Parthian empire exhibited under other names a lively image of the feudal system  The modern Persians distinguish that period as the dynasty of the kings of the

boldest rebels and the reduction of the strongest fortifications  Eutychius tom i p relates the siege of the island of Mesene in the Tigris with some circumstances not unlike the story of Nisus and Scylla  diffused the terror of his arms and prepared the way for the peaceful reception of his authority An obstinate resistance was fatal to the chiefs but their followers were treated with lenity  Agathias ii The princes of Segestan defended their independence during many years As romances generally transport to an ancient period the events of their own time it is not impossible that the fabulous exploits of Rustan prince of Segestan may have been grafted on this real history  A cheerful submission was rewarded with honours and riches but the prudent Artaxerxes suffering no person except himself to assume the title of king abolished every intermediate power between the throne and the people His kingdom nearly  Extent and population of Persia  equal in extent to modern Persia was on every side bounded by the sea or by great rivers by the Euphrates the Tigris the Araxes the Oxus and the Indus by the Caspian Sea and the Gulph of Persia  We can scarcely attribute to the Persian monarchy the sea coast of Gedrosia or Macran which extends along the Indian Ocean from Cape Jask the promontory Capella to Cape Goadel In the time of Alexander and probably many ages afterwards it was thinly inhabited by a savage people of Icthyophagi or Fishermen who knew no arts who acknowledged no master and who were divided by inhospitable deserts from the rest of the world See Arrian de Reb Indicis In the twelfth century the little town of Taiz supposed by M d'Anville to be the Tesa of Ptolemy was peopled and enriched by the resort of the Arabian merchants See Geographie Nubiens p and d'Anville Geographie Ancienne tom ii p In the last age the whole country was divided between three princes one Mahometan and two Idolaters who maintained their independence against the successors of Shaw Abbas Voyages de Tavernier part i l v p  That country was computed  to contain in the last century five hundred and fiftyfour cities sixty thousand villages and about forty millions of souls  Chardin tom iii c  If we compare the administration of the house of Sassan with that of the house of Sefi the political influence of the Magian with that of the Mahometan religion we shall probably infer that the kingdom of Artaxerxes contained at least as great a number of cities villages and inhabitants But it must likewise be confessed that in every age the want of harbours on the seacoast and the scarcity of fresh water in the inland provinces have been very unfavourable to the commerce and agriculture of the Persians who in the calculation of their numbers seem to have indulged one of the meanest though most common articles of national vanity  As soon as the ambitious mind of Artaxerxes  Recapitulation of the war between the Parthian and Roman empire  had triumphed over the resistance of his vassals he began to threaten the neighbouring states who during the long slumber of his predecessors had insulted Persia with impunity He obtained some easy victories over the wild Scythians and the effeminate Indians but the Romans were an enemy who by their past injuries and present power deserved the utmost efforts of his arms A forty years tranquillity the fruit of valour and  moderation had succeeded the victories of Trajan During the period that elapsed from the accession of Marcus to the reign of Alexander the Roman and the Parthian empires were twice engaged in war and although the whole strength of the Arsacides contended with a part only of the forces of Rome the event was most commonly in favour of the latter Macrinus indeed prompted by his precarious situation and pusillanimous temper purchased a peace at the expence of near two millions of our money  Dion l xxviii p  but the generals of Marcus the emperor Severus and his son erected many trophies in Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria Among their exploits the imperfect relation of which would have unseasonably interrupted the more important series of domestic revolutions we shall only mention the repeated calamities of the two great cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon  Seleucia on the western bank of the Tigris  Cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon  about fortyfive miles to the north of ancient Babylon was the capital of the Macedonian conquests in Upper Asia  For the precise situation of Babylon Seleucia Ctesiphon Modain and Bagdad cities often confounded with each other see an excellent Geographical Tract of M d'Anville in Mem de l'Academie tom xxx  Many ages after the fall of their empire Seleucia retained the genuine characters of a Grecian colony arts military virtue and the love of freedom The independent republic was governed by a senate of three hundred nobles the people consisted of  six hundred thousand citizens the walls were strong and as long as concord prevailed among the several orders of the state they viewed with contempt the power of the Parthian but the madness of faction was sometimes provoked to implore the dangerous aid of the common enemy who was posted almost at the gates of the colony  Tacit Annal xi Plin Hist Nat vi  The Parthian monarchs like the Mogul sovereigns of Hindostan delighted in the pastoral life of their Scythian ancestors and the Imperial camp was frequently pitched in the plain of Ctesiphon on the eastern bank of the Tigris at the distance of only three miles from Seleucia  This may be inferred from Strabo l xvi p  The innumerable attendants on luxury and despotism resorted to the court and the little village of Ctesiphon insensibly swelled into a great city  That most curious traveller Bernier who followed the camp of Aurengzebe from Dehli to Cashmir describes with great accuracy the immense moving city The guard of cavalry consisted of men that of infantry of It was computed that the camp contained horses mules and elephants camels oxen and between and persons Almost all Dehli followed the court whose magnificence supported its industry  Under the reign of Marcus the Roman generals penetrated as far as Ctesiphon and Seleucia They were received as friends  A D  by the Greek colony they attacked as enemies the seat of the Parthian kings yet both cities experienced the same treatment The sack and conflagration of Seleucia with the massacre of three hundred thousand of the inhabitants tarnished  the glory of the Roman triumph  Dion l lxxi p Hist August p Eutrop viii Euseb in Chronic Quadratus quoted in the Augustan History attempted to vindicate the Romans by alleging that the citizens of Seleucia had first violated their faith  Seleucia already exhausted by the neighbourhood of a too powerful rival sunk under the fatal blow but Ctesiphon in about thirtythree years  A D  had sufficiently recovered its strength to maintain an obstinate siege against the emperor Severus The city was however taken by assault the king who defended it in person escaped with precipitation an hundred thousand captives and a rich booty rewarded the fatigues of the Roman soldiers  Dion l lxxv p Herodian l iii p Hist August p  Notwithstanding these misfortunes Ctesiphon succeeded to Babylon and to Seleucia as one of the great capitals of the East In summer the monarch of Persia enjoyed at Ecbatana the cool breezes of the mountains of Media but the mildness of the climate engaged him to prefer Ctesiphon for his winterresidence  From these successful inroads the Romans derived  Conquest of Osrhoene by the Romans  no real or lasting benefit nor did they attempt to preserve such distant conquests separated from the provinces of the empire by a large tract of intermediate desert The reduction of the kingdom of Osrhoene was an acquisition of less splendour indeed but of a far more solid advantage That little state occupied the northern and most fertile part of Mesopotamia between the Euphrates and the Tigris Edessa  its capital was situated about twenty miles beyond the former of those rivers and the inhabitants since the time of Alexander were a mixed race of Greeks Arabs Syrians and Armenians  The polished citizens of Antioch called those of Edessa mixed barbarians It was however some praise that of the three dialects of the Syriac the purest and most elegant the Aramaean was spoke at Edessa This remark M Bayer Hist Edess p has borrowed from George of Malatia a Syrian writer  The feeble sovereigns of Osrhoene placed on the dangerous verge of two contending empires were attached from inclination to the Parthian cause but the superior power of Rome exacted from them a reluctant homage which is still attested by their medals After the conclusion of the Parthian war under Marcus it was judged prudent to secure some substantial pledges of their doubtful fidelity Forts were constructed in several parts of the country and a Roman garrison was fixed in the strong town of Nisibis During the troubles that followed the death of Commodus the princes of Osrhoene attempted to shake off the yoke but the stern policy of Severus confirmed their dependance  Dion l lxxv p M Bayer has neglected to use this most important passage  and the perfidy of Caracalla completed the easy conquest Abgarus the last king of Edessa was sent in  A D  chains to Rome his dominions reduced into a province and his capital dignified with the rank of colony and thus the Romans about ten years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy obtained  a firm and permanent establishment beyond the Euphrates  This kingdom from Osrhoes who gave a new name to the country to the last Abgarus had lasted years See the learned work of M Bayer Historia Osrhoena et Edessena    Prudence as well as glory might have justified  Artaxerxes claims the provinces of Asia and declares war against the Romans A D  a war on the side of Artaxerxes had his views been confined to the defence or the acquisition of a useful frontier But the ambitious Persian openly avowed a far more extensive design of conquest and he thought himself able to support his lofty pretensions by the arms of reason as well as by those of power Cyrus he alleged had first subdued and his successors had for a long time possessed the whole extent of Asia as far as the Propontis and the Aegaean Sea the provinces of Caria and Ionia under their empire had been governed by Persian satraps and all Egypt to the confines of Aethiopia had acknowledged their sovereignty  Xenophon in the preface to the Cyropaedia gives a clear and magnificent idea of the extent of the empire of Cyrus Herodotus l iii c c enters into a curious and particular description of the twenty great  Satrapies  into which the Persian empire was divided by Darius Hystaspes  Their rights had been suspended but not destroyed by a long usurpation and as soon as he received the Persian diadem which birth and successful valour had placed upon his head the first great duty of his station called upon him to restore the ancient limits and splendour of the monarchy The Great King therefore such was the haughty style of his embassies to the emperor Alexander commanded the Romans instantly to depart from  all the provinces of his ancestors and yielding to the Persians the empire of Asia to content themselves with the undisturbed possession of Europe This haughty mandate was delivered by four hundred of the tallest and most beautiful of the Persians who by their fine horses splendid arms and rich apparel displayed the pride and greatness of their master  Herodian vi  Such an embassy was much less an offer of negociation than a declaration of war Both Alexander Severus and Artaxerxes collecting the military force of the Roman and Persian monarchies resolved in this important contest to lead their armies in person  If we credit what should seem the most authentic  Pretended victory of Alexander Severus A D  of all records an oration still extant and delivered by the emperor himself to the senate we must allow that the victory of Alexander Severus was not inferior to any of those formerly obtained over the Persians by the son of Philip The army of the Great King consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand horse clothed in complete armour of steel of seven hundred elephants with towers filled with archers on their backs and of eighteen hundred chariots armed with scythes This formidable host the like of which is not to be found in eastern history and has scarcely been imagined in eastern romance  There were two hundred scythed chariots at the battle of Arbela in the host of Darius In the vast army of Tigranes which was vanquished by Lucullus seventeen thousand horse only were completely armed Antiochus brought fiftyfour elephants into the field against the Romans by his frequent wars and negociations with the princes of India he had once collected an hundred and fifty of those great animals but it may be questioned whether the most powerful monarch of Hindostan ever formed a line of battle of seven hundred elephants Instead of three or four thousand elephants which the Great Mogul was supposed to possess Tavernier Voyages part ii l i p discovered by a more accurate inquiry that he had only five hundred for his baggage and eighty or ninety for the service of war The Greeks have varied with regard to the number which Porus brought into the field but Quintus Curtius viii in this instance judicious and moderate is contented with eightyfive elephants distinguished by their size and strength In Siam where these animals are the most numerous and the most esteemed eighteen elephants are allowed as a sufficient proportion for each of the nine brigades into which a just army is divided The whole number of one hundred and sixtytwo elephants of war may sometimes be doubled Hist des Voyages tom ix p    was discomfited in a great battle in which the Roman Alexander approved himself an intrepid soldier and a skilful general The Great King fled before his valour an immense booty and the conquest of Mesopotamia were the immediate fruits of this signal victory Such are the circumstances of this ostentatious and improbable relation dictated as it too plainly appears by the vanity of the monarch adorned by the unblushing servility of his flatterers and received without contradiction by a distant and obsequious senate  Hist August p  Far from being inclined to believe that the arms of Alexander obtained any memorable advantage over the Persians we are induced to suspect that all this blaze of imaginary glory was designed to conceal some real disgrace  Our suspicions are confirmed by the authority of a contemporary historian who mentions the virtues of Alexander with respect and his faults  More probable account of the war  with candour He describes the judicious plan which had been formed for the conduct of the war Three Roman armies were destined to invade Persia at the same time and by different roads But the operations of the campaign though wisely concerted were not executed either with ability or success The first of these armies as soon as it had entered the marshy plains of Babylon towards the artificial conflux of the Euphrates and the Tigris  M de Tillemont has already observed that Herodian's geography is somewhat confused  was encompassed by the superior numbers and destroyed by the arrows of the enemy The alliance of Chosroes king of Armenia  Moses of Chorene Hist Armen l ii c illustrates this invasion of Media by asserting that Chosroes king of Armenia defeated Artaxerxes and pursued him to the confines of India The exploits of Chosroes have been magnified and he acted as a dependent ally to the Romans  and the long tract of mountainous country in which the Persian cavalry was of little service opened a secure entrance into the heart of Media to the second of the Roman armies These brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces and by several successful actions against Artaxerxes gave a faint colour to the emperor's vanity But the retreat of this victorious army was imprudent or at least unfortunate In repassing the mountains great numbers of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads and  the severity of the winter season It had been resolved that whilst these two great detachments penetrated into the opposite extremes of the Persian dominions the main body under the command of Alexander himself should support their attack by invading the centre of the kingdom But the unexperienced youth influenced by his mother's counsels and perhaps by his own fears deserted the bravest troops and the fairest prospect of victory and after consuming in Mesopotamia an inactive and inglorious summer he led back to Antioch an army diminished by sickness and provoked by disappointment The behaviour of Artaxerxes had been very different Flying with rapidity from the hills of Media to the marshes of the Euphrates he had every where opposed the invaders in person and in either fortune had united with the ablest conduct the most undaunted resolution But in several obstinate engagements against the veteran legions of Rome the Persian monarch had lost the flower of his troops Even his victories had weakened his power The favourable opportunities of the absence of Alexander and of the confusions that followed that emperor's death presented themselves in vain to his ambition Instead of expelling the Romans as he pretended from the continent of Asia he found himself unable to wrest from their hands the little province of Mesopotamia  For the account of this war see Herodian l vi p The old abbreviators and modern compilers have blindly followed the Augustan History    The reign of Artaxerxes which from the last defeat of the Parthians lasted only fourteen years forms a memorable aera in the history of the East  Character and maxims of Artaxerxes A D  and even in that of Rome His character seems to have been marked by those bold and commanding features that generally distinguish the princes who conquer from those who inherit an empire Till the last period of the Persian monarchy his code of laws was respected as the groundwork of their civil and religious policy  Eutychius tom ii p vers Pocock The great Chosroes Noushirwan sent the Code of Artaxerxes to all his Satraps as the invariable rule of their conduct  Several of his sayings are preserved One of them in particular discovers a deep insight into the constitution of government  The authority of the princesaid Artaxerxes must be defended by a military force that force can only be maintained by taxes all taxes must at last fall upon agriculture and agriculture can never flourish except under the protection of justice and moderation  D'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale au mot  Ardshir  We may observe that after an ancient period of fables and a long interval of darkness the modern histories of Persia begin to assume an air of truth with the dynasty of the Sassanides    Artaxerxes bequeathed his new empire and his ambitious designs against the Romans to Sapor a son not unworthy of his great father but those designs were too extensive for the power of Persia and served only to involve both nations in a long series of destructive wars and reciprocal calamities  The Persians long since civilized and corrupted were very far from possessing the martial independence and the intrepid hardiness both of  Military power of the Persians  mind and body which have rendered the northern barbarians masters of the world The science of war that constituted the more rational force of Greece and Rome as it now does of Europe never made any considerable progress in the East Those disciplined evolutions which harmonize and animate a confused multitude were unknown to the Persians They were equally unskilled in the arts of constructing besieging or defending regular fortifications They trusted more to their numbers than to their courage more to their courage than to their discipline The infantry was a halfarmed spiritless crowd of peasants levied in haste by the  Their infantry contemptible  allurements of plunder and as easily dispersed by a victory as by a defeat The monarch and his nobles transported into the camp the pride and luxury of the seraglio Their military operations were impeded by a useless train of women eunuchs horses and camels and in the midst of a successful campaign the Persian host was often separated or destroyed by an unexpected famine  Herodian l vi p Ammianus Marcellinus l xxiii c Some differences may be observed between the two historians the natural effects of the changes produced by a century and a half    But the nobles of Persia in the bosom of luxury  Their cavalry excellent  and despotism preserved a strong sense of personal gallantry and national honour From  the age of seven years they were taught to speak truth to shoot with the bow and to ride and it was universally confessed that in the two last of these arts they had made a more than common proficiency  The Persians are still the most skilful horsemen and their horses the finest in the East  The most distinguished youth were educated under the monarch's eye practised their exercises in the gate of his palace and were severely trained up to the habits of temperance and obedience in their long and laborious parties of hunting In every province the satrap maintained a like school of military virtue The Persian nobles so natural is the idea of feudal tenures received from the king's bounty lands and houses on the condition of their service in war They were ready on the first summons to mount on horseback with a martial and splendid train of followers and to join the numerous bodies of guards who were carefully selected from amongst the most robust slaves and the bravest adventurers of Asia These armies both of light and of heavy cavalry equally formidable by the impetuosity of their charge and the rapidity of their motions threatened as an impending cloud the eastern provinces of the declining empire of Rome  From Herodotus Xenophon Herodian Ammianus Chardin c I have extracted such  probable  accounts of the Persian nobility as seem either common to every age or particular to that of the Sassanides    CHAP IX  The State of Germany till the Invasion of the Barbarians in the Time of the Emperor Decius  THE government and religion of Persia have deserved some notice from their connexion with the decline and fall of the Roman empire We shall occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian tribes which with their arms and horses their flocks and herds their wives and families wandered over the immense plains which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula from the confines of Persia to those of Germany But the warlike Germans who first resisted then invaded and at length overturned the western monarchy of Rome will occupy a much more important place in this history and possess a stronger and if we may use the expression a more domestic claim to our attention and regard The most civilized nations of modern Europe issued from the woods of Germany and in the rude institutions of those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles of our present laws and manners In their primitive state of simplicity and independence the Germans were surveyed by the discerning eye and delineated by the masterly pencil of Tacitus the first of historians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts The expressive conciseness of his descriptions has deserved to exercise  the diligence of innumerable antiquarians and to excite the genius and penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times The subject however various and important has already been so frequently so ably and so successfully discussed that it is now grown familiar to the reader and difficult to the writer We shall therefore content ourselves with observing and indeed with repeating some of the most important circumstances of climate of manners and of institutions which rendered the wild barbarians of Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power  Ancient Germany excluding from its independent  Extent of Germany  limits the province westward of the Rhine which had submitted to the Roman yoke extended itself over a third part of Europe Almost the whole of modern Germany Denmark Norway Sweden Finland Livonia Prussia and the greater part of Poland were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation whose complexion manners and language denoted a common origin and preserved a striking resemblance On the west ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallic and on the south by the Danube from the Illyrian provinces of the empire A ridge of hills rising from the Danube and called the Carpathian Mountains covered Germany on the side of Dacia or Hungary The eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the Sarmatians and was often confounded by the mixture of warring and confederating tribes of the two nations  In the remote darkness of the north the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea and beyond the Peninsula or islands  The modern philosophers of Sweden seem agreed that the waters of the Baltic gradually sink in a regular proportion which they have ventured to estimate at half an inch every year Twenty centuries ago the flat country of Scandinavia must have been covered by the sea while the high lands rose above the waters as so many islands of various forms and dimensions Such indeed is the notion given us by Mela Pliny and Tacitus of the vast countries round the Baltic See in the Bibliotheque RaisonnÃ©c tom xl and xlv a large abstract of Dalin's History of Sweden composed in the Swedish language  of Scandinavia  Some ingenious writers  In particular Mr Hume the AbbÃ© du Bos and M Pelloutier Hist des Celtes tom i  have suspected that Europe was much colder formerly than it is at  Climate  present and the most ancient descriptions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to confirm their theory The general complaints of intense frost and eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded since we have no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the thermometer the feelings or the expressions of an orator born in the happier regions of Greece or Asia But I shall select two remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature The great rivers which covered the Roman provinces the Rhine and the Danube were frequently frozen over and capable of supporting the most enormous weights The barbarians who often chose that severe season for their inroads transported without apprehension or danger their numerous armies their  cavalry and their heavy waggons over a vast and solid bridge of ice  Diodorus Siculus l v p Edit Wessel Herodian l vi p Jornandes c On the banks of the Danube the wine when brought to table was frequently frozen into great lumps  frusta vini  Ovid Epist ex Ponto l iv Virgil Georgic l iii The fact is confirmed by a soldier and a philosopher who had experienced the intense cold of Thrace See Xenophon Anabasis l vii p Edit Hutchinson  Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phaenomenon The rein deer that useful animal from whom the savage of the North derives the best comforts of his dreary life is of a constitution that supports and even requires the most intense cold He is found on the rock of Spitzberg within ten degrees of the Pole he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and Siberia but at present he cannot subsist much less multiply in any country to the south of the Baltic  Buffon Histoire Naturelle tom xii p  In the time of Caesar the rein deer as well as the elk and the wild bull was a native of the Hercynian forest which then overshadowed a great part of Germany and Poland  Caesar de Bell Gallic vi c The most inquisitive of the Germans were ignorant of its utmost limits although some of them had travelled in it more than sixty days journey  The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes of the diminution of the cold These immense woods have been gradually cleared which intercepted from the earth the rays of the sun  Cluverius Germania Antiqua l iii c investigates the small and scattered remains of the Hercynian wood  The morasses have been drained and in proportion as the soil has been cultivated the air has become more temperate Canada at this  day is an exact picture of ancient Germany Although situated in the same parallel with the finest provinces of France and England that country experiences the most rigorous cold The rein deer are very numerous the ground is covered with deep and lasting snow and the great river of St Lawrence is regularly frozen in a season when the waters of the Seine and the Thames are usually free from ice  Charlevoix Histoire du Canada    It is difficult to ascertain and easy to exaggerate the influence of the climate of ancient Germany  Its effects on the natives  over the minds and bodies of the natives Many writers have supposed and most have allowed though as it should seem without any adequate proof that the rigorous cold of the North was favourable to long life and generative vigour that the women were more fruitful and the human species more prolific than in warmer or more temperate climates  Olaus Rudbeck asserts that the Swedish women often bear ten or twelve children and not uncommonly twenty or thirty but the authority of Rudbeck is much to be suspected  We may assert with greater confidence that the keen air of Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives who were in general of a more lofty stature than the people of the South  In hos artus in haec corpora quae miramur excrescunt Tacit Germania Cluver l i c  gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent exertions than to patient labour and inspired them with constitutional bravery which is the result of nerves and spirits The severity of a winter campaign  that chilled the courage of the Roman troops was scarcely felt by these hardy children of the North  Plutarch in Mario The Cimbri by way of amusement often slid down mountains of snow on their broad shields  who in their turn were unable to resist the summer heats and dissolved away in languor and sickness under the beams of an Italian sun  The Romans made war in all climates and by their excellent discipline were in a great measure preserved in health and vigour It may be remarked that man is the only animal which can live and multiply in every country from the equator to the poles The hog seems to approach the nearest to our species in that privilege    There is not any where upon the globe a large  Origin of the Germans  tract of country which we have discovered destitute of inhabitants or whose first population can be fixed with any degree of historical certainty And yet as the most philosophic minds can seldom refrain from investigating the infancy of great nations our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed efforts When Tacitus considered the purity of the German blood and the forbidding aspect of the country he was disposed to pronounce those barbarians  Indigenae  or natives of the soil We may allow with safety and perhaps with truth that ancient Germany was not originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a political society  Tacit German c The emigration of the Gauls followed the course of the Danube and discharged itself on Greece and Asia Tacitus could discover only one inconsiderable tribe that retained any traces of a Gallic origin  but that the name and nation received their existence from the gradual union of some wandering  savages of the Hercynian woods To assert those savages to have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be a rash inference condemned by religion and unwarranted by reason  Such rational doubt is but illsuited with the  Fables and conjectures  genius of popular vanity Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of the world the ark of Noah has been of the same use as was formerly to the Greeks and Romans the siege of Troy On a narrow basis of acknowledged truth an immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected and the wild Irishman  According to Dr Keating History of Ireland p the giant Partholanus who was the son of Seara the son of Esra the son of Sru the son of Framant the son of Fathaclan the son of Magog the son of Japhet the son of Noah landed on the coast of Munster the th day of May in the year of the world one thousand nine hundred and seventyeight Though he succeeded in his great enterprise the loose behaviour of his wife rendered his domestic life very unhappy and provoked him to such a degree that he killedher favourite greyhound This as the learned historian very properly observes was the  first  instance of female falsehood and infidelity ever known in Ireland  as well as the wild Tartar  Genealogical History of the Tartars by Abulghazi Bahadur Khan  could point out the individual son of Japhet from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended The last century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy faith who by the dim light of legends and traditions of conjectures and etymologies conducted the great grandchildren of Noah from the Tower of Babel to the extremities of the globe Of these judicious critics one of the most entertaining  was Olaus Rudbeck professor in the university of Upsal  His work entitled Atlantica is uncommonly scarce Bayle has given two most curious extracts from it Republique des Lettres Janvier et Fevrier  Whatever is celebrated either in history or fable this zealous patriot ascribes to his country From Sweden which formed so considerable a part of ancient Germany the Greeks themselves derived their alphabetical characters their astronomy and their religion Of that delightful region for such it appeared to the eyes of a native the Atlantis of Plato the country of the Hyperboreans the gardens of the Hesperides the Fortunate Islands and even the Elysian Fields were all but faint and imperfect transcripts A clime so profusely favoured by Nature could not long remain desert after the flood The learned Rudbeck allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to about twenty thousand persons He then disperses them into small colonies to replenish the earth and to propagate the human species The German or Swedish detachment which marched if I am not mistaken under the command of Askenaz the son of Gomer the son of Japhet distinguished itself by a more than common diligence in the prosecution of this great work The northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe Africa and Asia and to use the author's metaphor the blood circulated from the extremities to the heart  But all this welllaboured system of German antiquities is annihilated by a single fact too well  The Germans ignorant of letters  attested to admit of any doubt and of too decisive a nature to leave room for any reply The Germans in the age of Tacitus were unacquainted with the use of letters  Tacit Germ ii Literarum secreta viri pariter ac foeminae ignorant We may rest contented with this decisive authority without entering into the obscure disputes concerning the antiquity of the Runic characters The learned Celsius a Swede a scholar and a philosopher was of opinion that they were nothing more than the Roman letters with the curves changed into straight lines for the ease of engraving See Pelloutier Histoire des Celtes l ii c Dictionnaire Diplomatique tom i p We may add that the oldest Runic inscriptions are supposed to be of the third century and the most ancient writer who mentions the Runic characters is Venantius Fortunatus Carm vii who lived towards the end of the sixth century Barbara fraxineis pingatur RUNA tabellis  and the use of letters is the principal circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd of savages incapable of knowledge or reflection Without that artificial help the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted to her charge and the nobler faculties of the mind no longer supplied with models or with materials gradually forget their powers the judgment becomes feeble and lethargic the imagination languid or irregular Fully to apprehend this important truth let us attempt in an improved society to calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and the  illiterate  peasant The former by reading and reflection multiplies his own experience and lives in distant ages and remote countries whilst the latter rooted to a single spot and confined to a few years of existence surpasses but very little his fellowlabourer  the ox in the exercise of his mental faculties The same and even a greater difference will be found between nations than between individuals and we may safely pronounce that without some species of writing no people has ever preserved the faithful annals of their history ever made any considerable progress in the abstract sciences or ever possessed in any tolerable degree of perfection the useful and agreeable arts of life  Of these arts the ancient Germans were wretchedly  of arts and agriculture  destitute They passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty which it has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of virtuous simplicity Modern Germany is said to contain about two thousand three hundred walled towns  Recherches Philosophiques sur les Americains tom iii p The author of that very curious work is if I am not misinformed a German by birth  In a much wider extent of country the geographer Ptolemy could discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the name of cities  The Alexandrian Geographer is often criticised by the accurate Cluverius  though according to our ideas they would but ill deserve that splendid title We can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications constructed in the centre of the woods and designed to secure the women children and cattle whilst the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion  See Caesar and the learned Mr Whitaker in his History of Manchester vol i    But Tacitus asserts as a wellknown fact that the Germans in his time had  no  cities  Tacit Germ  and that they affected to despise the works of Roman industry as places of confinement rather than of security  When the Germans commanded the Ubii of Cologne to cast off the Roman yoke and with their new freedom to resume their ancient manners they insisted on the immediate demolition of the walls of the colony  Postulamus a vobis muros coloniae munimenta servitii detrahatis etiam fera animalia si clausa teneas virtutis obliviscuntur  Tacit Hist iv  Their edifices were not even contiguous or formed into regular villas  The straggling villages of Silesia are several miles in length See Cluver l i c  each barbarian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain a wood or a stream of fresh water had induced him to give the preference Neither stone nor brick nor tiles were employed in these slight habitations  One hundred and forty years after Tacitus a few more regular structures were erected near the Rhine and Danube Herodian l vii p  They were indeed no more than low huts of a circular figure built of rough timber thatched with straw and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke In the most inclement winter the hardy German was satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal The nations who dwelt towards the North clothed themselves in furs and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse kind of linen  Tacit Germ  The game of various sorts with which the forests of Germany were plentifully stocked supplied its inhabitants  with food and exercise  Tacit Germ  Their monstrous herds of cattle less remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility  Caesar de Bell Gall vi  formed the principal object of their wealth A small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the earth the use of orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the Germans nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people whose property every year experienced a general change by a new division of the arable lands and who in that strange operation avoided disputes by suffering a great part of their territory to lie waste and without tillage  Tacit Germ Caesar vi    Gold silver and iron were extremely scarce in Germany Its barbarous inhabitants wanted  and of the use of metals  both skill and patience to investigate those rich veins of silver which have so liberally rewarded the attention of the princes of Brunswick and Saxony Sweden which now supplies Europe with iron was equally ignorant of its own riches and the appearance of the arms of the Germans furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal The various transactions of peace and war had introduced some Roman coins chiefly silver among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the use of money carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities and  prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases the presents of Rome to their princes and ambassadors  Tacit Germ  To a mind capable of reflection such leading facts convey more instruction than a tedious detail of subordinate circumstances The value of money has been settled by general consent to express our wants and our property as letters were invented to express our ideas and both these institutions by giving a more active energy to the powers and passions of human nature have contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to represent The use of gold and silver is in a great measure factitious but it would be impossible to enumerate the important and various services which agriculture and all the arts have received from iron when tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire and the dexterous hand of man Money in a word is the most universal incitement iron the most powerful instrument of human industry and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people neither actuated by the one nor seconded by the other could emerge from the grossest barbarism  It is said that the Mexicans and Peruvians without the use of either money or iron had made a very great progress in the arts Those arts and the monuments they produced have been strangely magnified See Recherches sur les Americains tom ii p c    If we contemplate a savage nation in any part  Their indolence  of the globe a supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to constitute their general character In a civilized state every faculty  of man is expanded and exercised and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of society The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant and useful labour The select few placed by fortune above that necessity can however fill up their time by the pursuits of interest or glory by the improvement of their estate or of their understanding by the duties the pleasures and even the follies of social life The Germans were not possessed of these varied resources The care of the house and family the management of the land and cattle were delegated to the old and the infirm to women and slaves The lazy warrior destitute of every art that might employ his leisure hours consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of sleep and food And yet by a wonderful diversity of Nature according to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses the same barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless of mankind They delight in sloth they detest tranquillity  Tacit Germ  The languid soul oppressed with its own weight anxiously required some new and powerful sensation and war and danger were the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper The sound that summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy gave him an active pursuit and by strong exercise of the body and violent emotions of the mind restored him to a  more lively sense of his existence In the dull intervals of peace these barbarians were immoderately addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking both of which by different means the one by inflaming their passions the other by extinguishing their reason alike relieved them from the pain of thinking They gloried in passing whole days and nights at table and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous and drunken assemblies  Tacit Germ  Their debts of honour for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play they discharged with the most romantic fidelity The desperate gamester who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice patiently submitted to the decision of fortune and suffered himself to be bound chastised and sold into remote slavery by his weaker but more lucky antagonist  Id The Germans might borrow the  arts  of play from the Romans but the  passion  is wonderfully inherent in the human species    Strong beer a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley and  corrupted  as it is  Their taste for strong liquors  strongly expressed by Tacitus into a certain semblance of wine was sufficient for the gross purposes of German debauchery But those who had tasted the rich wines of Italy and afterwards of Gaul sighed for that more delicious species of intoxication They attempted not however as has since been executed with so much success to naturalize the vine on the banks of the Rhine and Danube nor did they endeavour to procure  by industry the materials of an advantageous commerce To solicit by labour what might be ravished by arms was esteemed unworthy of the German spirit  Tacit Germ  The intemperate thirst of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied presents The Tuscan who betrayed his country to the Celtic nations attracted them into Italy by the prospect of the rich fruits and delicious wines the productions of a happier climate  Plutarch in Camillo T Liv v  And in the same manner the German auxiliaries invited into France during the civil wars of the sixteenth century were allured by the promise of plenteous quarters in the the provinces of Champaigne and Burgundy  Dubos Hist de la Monarchie FranÃ§oise tom i p  Drunkenness the most illiberal but not the most dangerous of  our  vices was sometimes capable in a less civilized state of mankind of occasioning a battle a war or a revolution  The climate of ancient Germany has been mollified  State of population  and the soil fertilized by the labour of ten centuries from the time of Charlemagne The same extent of ground which at present maintains in ease and plenty a million of husbandmen and artificers was unable to supply an hundred thousand lazy warriors with the simple necessaries of life  The Helvetian nation which issued from the country called Switzerland contained of every age and sex persons Caesar de Bell Gall i At present the number of people in the Pays de Vaud a small district on the banks of the Leman Lake much more distinguished for politeness than for industry amounts to See an excellent Tract of M Muret in the Memoires de la SocietÃ© de Bern  The Germans abandoned their  immense forests to the exercise of hunting employed in pasturage the most considerable part of their lands bestowed on the small remainder a rude and careless cultivation and then accused the scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to maintain the multitude of its inhabitants When the return of famine severely admonished them of the importance of the arts the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration of a third perhaps or a fourth part of their youth  Paul Diaconus c Machiavel Davila and the rest of Paul's followers represent these emigrations too much as regular and concerted measures  The possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which bind a civilized people to an improved country But the Germans who carried with them what they most valued their arms their cattle and their women cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest The innumerable swarms that issued or seemed to issue from the great storehouse of nations were multiplied by the fears of the vanquished and by the credulity of succeeding ages And from facts thus exaggerated an opinion was gradually established and has been supported by writers of distinguished reputation that in the age of Caesar and Tacitus the inhabitants of the North were far more numerous than they are in  our days  Sir William Temple and Montesquieu have indulged on this subject the usual liveliness of their fancy  A more serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have convinced modern philosophers of the falsehood and indeed the impossibility of the supposition To the names of Mariana and of Machiavel  Machiavel Hist di Firenze l i Mariana Hist Hispan l v c  we can oppose the equal names of Robertson and Hume  Robertson's Cha V Hume's Political Essays    A warlike nation like the Germans without  German freedom  either cities letters arts or money found some compensation for this savage state in the enjoyment of liberty Their poverty secured their freedom since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism  Among the Suiones says Tacitus riches are held in honour They are  therefore  subject to an absolute monarch who instead of intrusting his people with the free use of arms as is practised in the rest of Germany commits them to the safe custody not of a citizen or even of a freedman but of a slave The neighbours of the Suiones the Sitones are sunk even below servitude they obey a woman  Tacit German Frenshemius who dedicated his supplement to Livy to Christina of Sweden thinks proper to be very angry with the Roman who expressed so very little reverence for Northern queens    In the mention of these exceptions the great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of government We are only at a loss to conceive  by what means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the North and extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the Roman provinces or how the ancestors of those Danes and Norwegians so distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit could thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty  May we not suspect that superstition was the parent of despotism The descendants of Odin whose race was not extinct till the year are said to have reigned in Sweden above a thousand years The temple of Upsal was the ancient seat of religion and empire In the year I find a singular law prohibiting the use and profession of arms to any except the king's guards It is not probable that it was coloured by the pretence of reviving an old institution See Dallin's History of Sweden in the BibliothÃ©que RaisonnÃ©e tom xl and xl v  Some tribes however on the coast of the Baltic acknowledged the authority of kings though without relinquishing the rights of men  Tacit Germ c  but in the far greater part of Germany the form of government was a democracy tempered indeed and controlled not so much by general and positive laws as by the occasional ascendant of birth or valour of eloquence or superstition  Id c c    Civil governments in their first institutions are  Assemblies of the people  voluntary associations for mutual defence To obtain the desired end it is absolutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself obliged to submit his private opinion and actions to the judgment of the greater number of his associates The German tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of political society As soon as a youth born of free parents had attained the age of manhood he was  introduced into the general council of his countrymen solemnly invested with a shield and spear and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth The assembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at stated seasons or on sudden emergencies The trial of public offences the election of magistrates and the great business of peace and war were determined by its independent voice Sometimes indeed these important questions were previously considered and prepared in a more select council of the principal chieftains  Grotius changes an expression of Tacitus  pertractantur  into  praetractantur  The correction is equally just and ingenious  The magistrates might deliberate and persuade the people only could resolve and execute and the resolutions of the Germans were for the most part hasty and violent Barbarians accustomed to place their freedom in gratifying the present passion and their courage in overlooking all future consequences turned away with indignant contempt from the remonstrances of justice and policy and it was the practice to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid counsels But whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury whenever he called upon his fellowcountrymen to assert the national honour or to pursue some enterprise full of danger and glory a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the eager applause of the assembly For the Germans always met  in arms and it was constantly to be dreaded lest an irregular multitude inflamed with faction and strong liquors should use those arms to enforce as well as to declare their furious resolves We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have been polluted with blood and the more numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious  Even in  our  ancient parliament the barons often carried a question not so much by the number of votes as by that of their armed followers    A general of the tribe was elected on occasions  Authority of the princes and magistrates  of danger and if the danger was pressing and extensive several tribes concurred in the choice of the same general The bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field by his example rather than by his commands But this power however limited was still invidious It expired with the war and in time of peace the German tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief  Caesar de Bell Gall vi    Princes  were however appointed in the general assembly to administer justice or rather to compose differences  Minuunt controversias is a very happy expression of Caesar's  in their respective districts In the choice of these magistrates as much regard was shewn to birth as to merit  Reges ex nobilitate duces ex virtute sumunt Tacit Germ  To each was assigned by the public a guard and a council of an hundred persons and the first of the princes appears to have enjoyed a preeminence of rank and honour  which sometimes tempted the Romans to compliment him with the regal title  Cluver Germ Ant l i c    The comparative view of the powers of the  more absolute over the property than over the persons of the Germans  magistrates in two remarkable instances is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of German manners The disposal of the landed property within their district was absolutely vested in their hands and they distributed it every year according to a new division  Caesar vi Tacit Germ  At the same time they were not authorized to punish with death to imprison or even to strike a private citizen  Tacit Germ  A people thus jealous of their persons and careless of their possessions must have been totally destitute of industry and the arts but animated with a high sense of honour and independence  The Germans respected only those duties which  Voluntary engagements  they imposed on themselves The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the magistrates  The noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chief to whom they devoted their arms and service A noble emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief amongst the chiefs to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions To be ever surrounded by a band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs their ornament in peace their defence in war The  glory of such distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe Presents and embassies solicited their friendship and the fame of their arms often ensured victory to the party which they espoused In the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valour by his companions shameful for the companions not to equal the valour of their chief To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy To protect his person and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits were the most sacred of their duties The chiefs combated for victory the companions for the chief The noblest warriors whenever their native country was sunk in the laziness of peace maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action to exercise their restless spirit and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers Gifts worthy of soldiers the warlike steed the bloody and ever victorious lance were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief The rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that  he  could bestow or  they  would accept War rapine and the freewill offerings of his friends supplied the materials of this munificence  Tacit Germ    This institution however it might accidentally weaken the several republics invigorated the general character of the Germans and even ripened amongst  them all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible the faith and valour the hospitality and the courtesy so conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry The honourable gifts bestowed by the chief on his brave companions have been supposed by an ingenious writer to contain the first rudiments of the fiefs distributed after the conquest of the Roman provinces by the barbarian lords among their vassals with a similar duty of homage and military service  Esprit des Loix l xxx c The brilliant imagination of Montesquieu is corrected however by the dry cold reason of the AbbÃ© de Mably Observations sur l'Histoire de France tom i p  These conditions are however very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient Germans who delighted in mutual presents but without either imposing or accepting the weight of obligations  Gaudent muneribus sed nec data imputant nec acceptis obligantur Tacit Germ c    In the days of chivalry or more properly of  German chastity  romance all the men were brave and all the women were chaste  and notwithstanding the latter of these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the former it is ascribed almost without exception to the wives of the ancient Germans Polygamy was not in use except among the princes and among them only for the sake of multiplying their alliances Divorces were prohibited by manners rather than by laws Adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable crimes nor was  seduction justified by example and fashion  The adulteress was whipped through the village Neither wealth nor beauty could inspire compassion or procure her a second husband  We may easily discover that Tacitus indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the Roman ladies yet there are some striking circumstances that give an air of truth or at least of probability to the conjugal faith and chastity of the Germans  Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly  Its probable causes  contributed to assuage the fiercer passions of human nature it seems to have been less favourable to the virtue of chastity whose most dangerous enemy is the softness of the mind The refinements of life corrupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes The gross appetite of love becomes most dangerous when it is elevated or rather indeed disguised by sentimental passion The elegance of dress of motion and of manners gives a lustre to beauty and inflames the senses through the imagination Luxurious entertainments midnight dances and licentious spectacles present at once temptation and opportunity to female frailty  Ovid employs two hundred lines in the research of places the most favourable to love Above all he considers the theatre as the best adapted to collect the beauties of Rome and to melt them into tenderness and sensuality  From such dangers the unpolished wives of the barbarians were secured by poverty solitude and the painful cares of a domestic life The German huts open on every side to the eye of indiscretion or  jealousy were a better safeguard of conjugal fidelity than the walls the bolts and the eunuchs of a Persian haram To this reason another may be added of a more honourable nature The Germans treated their women with esteem and confidence consulted them on every occasion of importance and fondly believed that in their breasts resided a sanctity and wisdom more than human Some of these interpreters of fate such as Velleda in the Batavian war governed in the name of the deity the fiercest nations of Germany  Tacit Hist iv  The rest of the sex without being adored as goddesses were respected as the free and equal companions of soldiers associated even by the marriage ceremony to a life of toil of danger and of glory  The marriage present was a yoke of oxen horses and arms See Germ c Tacitus is somewhat too florid on the subject  In their great invasions the camps of the barbarians were filled with a multitude of women who remained firm and undaunted amidst the sound of arms the various forms of destruction and the honourable wounds of their sons and husbands  The change of  exigere  into  exugere  is a most excellent correction  Fainting armies of Germans have more than once been driven back upon the enemy by the generous despair of the women who dreaded death much less than servitude If the day was irrecoverably lost they well knew how to deliver themselves and their children with their own hands from  an insulting victor  Tacit Germ c Plutarch in Mario Before the wives of the Teutones destroyed themselves and their children they had offered to surrender on condition that they should be received as the slaves of the vestal virgins  Heroines of such a cast may claim our admiration but they were most assuredly neither lovely nor very susceptible of love Whilst they affected to emulate the stern virtues of  man  they must have resigned that attractive softness in which principally consist the charm and weakness of  woman  Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress every tender emotion that stood in competition with honour and the first honour of the sex has ever been that of chastity The sentiments and conduct of these highspirited matrons may at once be considered as a cause as an effect and as a proof of the general character of the nation Female courage however it may be raised by fanaticism or confirmed by habit can be only a faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valour that distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found  The religious system of the Germans if the  Religion  wild opinions of savages can deserve that name was dictated by their wants their fears and their ignorance  Tacitus has employed a few lines and Cluverius one hundred and twentyfour pages on this obscure subject The former discovers in Germany the gods of Greece and Rome The latter is positive that under the emblems of the sun the moon and the fire his pious ancestors worshipped the Trinity in unity  They adored the great visible objects and agents of Nature the Sun and the  Moon the Fire and the Earth together with those imaginary deities who were supposed to preside over the most important occupations of human life They were persuaded that by some ridiculous arts of divination they could discover the will of the superior beings and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering to their altars Some applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion entertained by that people of the Deity whom they neither confined within the walls of a temple nor represented by any human figure but when we recollect that the Germans were unskilled in architecture and totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture we shall readily assign the true reason of a scruple which arose not so much from a superiority of reason as from a want of ingenuity The only temples in Germany were dark and ancient groves consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations Their secret gloom the imagined residence of an invisible power by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror  The sacred wood described with such sublime horror by Lucan was in the neighbourhood of Marseilles but there were many of the same kind in Germany  and the priests rude and illiterate as they were had been taught by experience the use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest  The same ignorance which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving or embracing the useful restraints of laws exposes them naked and unarmed  Its effects in peace  to the blind terrors of superstition The German priests improving this favourable temper of their countrymen had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns which the magistrate could not venture to exercise and the haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction when it was inflicted not by any human power but by the immediate order of the god of war  Tacit Germania c  The defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority The latter was constantly exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular assemblies and was sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare A solemn procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries of Mecklenburg and Pomerania The unknown symbol of the  Earth  covered with a thick veil was placed on a carriage drawn by cows and in this manner the goddess whose common residence was in the isle of Rugen visited several adjacent tribes of her worshippers During her progress the sound of war was hushed quarrels were suspended arms laid aside and the restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and harmony  Tacit Germania c  The  truce of God  so often and so ineffectually proclaimed by the  clergy of the eleventh century was an obvious imitation of this ancient custom  See Dr Robertson's History of Charles V vol i note    But the influence of religion was far more  in war  powerful to inflame than to moderate the fierce passions of the Germans Interest and fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most daring and the most unjust enterprises by the approbation of Heaven and full assurances of success The consecrated standards long revered in the groves of superstition were placed in the front of the battle  Tacit Germ c These standards were only the heads of wild beasts  and the hostile army was devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder  See an instance of this custom Tacit Annal xiii  In the faith of soldiers and such were the Germans cowardice is the most unpardonable of sins A brave man was the worthy favourite of their martial deities the wretch who had lost his shield was alike banished from the religious and the civil assemblies of his countrymen Some tribes of the north seem to have embraced the doctrine of transmigration  Caesar Diodorus and Lucan seem to ascribe this doctrine to the Gauls but M Pelloutier Histoire des Celtes l iii c labours to reduce their expressions to a more orthodox sense  others imagined a gross paradise of immortal drunkenness  Concerning this gross but alluring doctrine of the Edda see Fable xx in the curious version of that book published by M Mallet in his Introduction to the History of Denmark  All agreed that a life spent in arms and a glorious death in battle were the best preparations for a happy futurity either in this or in another world  The immortality so vainly promised by the priests was in some degree conferred by the bards That singular order of men has most  The bards  deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to investigate the antiquities of the Celts the Scandinavians and the Germans Their genius and character as well as the reverence paid to that important office have been sufficiently illustrated But we cannot so easily express or even conceive the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breast of their audience Among a polished people a taste for poetry is rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul And yet when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by Homer or Tasso we are insensibly seduced by the fiction and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour But how faint how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary study It was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but animated strains The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song and the passions which it tended to excite the desire of fame and the contempt of death were the habitual sentiments of a German mind  See Tacit Germ c Diodor Sicul l v Strabo l iv p The classical reader may remember the rank of Demodocus in the Phaeacian court and the ardour infused by Tyrtaeus into the fainting Spartans Yet there is little probability that the Greeks and the Germans were the same people Much learned trifling might be spared if our antiquarians would condescend to reflect that similar manners will naturally be produced by similar situations    Such was the situation and such were the manners of the ancient Germans Their climate their want of learning of arts and of  Causes which checked the progress of the Germans  laws their notions of honour of gallantry and of religion their sense of freedom impatience of peace and thirst of enterprise all contributed to form a people of military heroes And yet we find that during more than two hundred and fifty years that elapsed from the defeat of Varus to the reign of Decius these formidable barbarians made few considerable attempts and not any material impression on the luxurious and enslaved provinces of the empire Their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline and their fury was diverted by the intestine divisions of ancient Germany  I It has been observed with ingenuity and  Want of arms  not without truth that the command of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold But the rude tribes of Germany alike destitute of both those valuable metals were reduced slowly to acquire by their unassisted strength the possession of the one as well as the other The face of a German army displayed their poverty of iron Swords and the longer kind of lances they could seldom use Their  frameae  as they called them in their own language were long spears headed with a sharp but narrow iron point  and which as occasion required they either darted from a distance or pushed in close onset With this spear and with a shield their cavalry was contented A multitude of darts scattered  Missilia spargunt Tacit Germ c Either that historian used a vague expression or he meant that they were thrown at random  with incredible force were an additional resource of the infantry Their military dress when they wore any was nothing more than a loose mantle A variety of colours was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses scarce any by helmets Though the horses of Germany were neither beautiful swift nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the Roman manage several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry but in general the principal strength of the Germans consisted in their infantry  It was their principal distinction from the Sarmatians who generally fought on horseback  which was drawn up in several deep columns according to the distinction of tribes and families Impatient of fatigue or delay these  and of discipline  halfarmed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks and sometimes by the effort of native valour prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of the Roman mercenaries But as the barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the first onset they knew not how to rally or to retire A repulse was a sure defeat and a defeat was most commonly total destruction When we  recollect the complete armour of the Roman soldiers their discipline exercises evolutions fortified camps and military engines it appears a just matter of surprise how the naked and unassisted valour of the barbarians could dare to encounter in the field the strength of the legions and the various troops of the auxiliaries which seconded their operations The contest was too unequal till the introduction of luxury had enervated the vigour and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the discipline of the Roman armies The introduction of barbarian auxiliaries into those armies was a measure attended with very obvious dangers as it might gradually instruct the Germans in the arts of war and of policy Although they were admitted in small numbers and with the strictest precaution the example of Civilis was proper to convince the Romans that the danger was not imaginary and that their precautions were not always sufficient  The relation of this enterprise occupies a great part of the fourth and fifth books of the History of Tacitus and is more remarkable for its eloquence than perspicuity Sir Henry Saville has observed several inaccuracies  During the civil wars that followed the death of Nero that artful and intrepid Batavian whom his enemies condescended to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius  Tacit Hist iv Like them he had lost an eye  formed a great design of freedom and ambition Eight Batavian cohorts renowned in the wars of Britain and Italy repaired to his standard He introduced an army of Germans into Gaul prevailed  on the powerful cities of Treves and Langres to embrace his cause defeated the legions destroyed their fortified camps and employed against the Romans the military knowledge which he had acquired in their service When at length after an obstinate struggle he yielded to the power of the empire Civilis secured himself and his country by an honourable treaty The Batavians still continued to occupy the islands of the Rhine  It was contained between the two branches of the old Rhine as they subsisted before the face of the country was changed by art and nature See Cluver German Antiq l iii c  the allies not the servants of the Roman monarchy  II The strength of ancient Germany appears  Civil dissentions of Germany  formidable when we consider the effects that might have been produced by its united effort The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a million of warriors as all who were of age to bear arms were of a temper to use them But this fierce multitude incapable of concerting or executing any plan of national greatness was agitated by various and often hostile intentions Germany was divided into more than forty independent states and even in each state the union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious The barbarians were easily provoked they knew not how to forgive an injury much less an insult their resentments were bloody and implacable The casual disputes that so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking were sufficient to  inflame the minds of whole nations the private feud of any considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and allies To chastise the insolent or to plunder the defenceless were alike causes of war The most formidable states of Germany affected to encompass their territories with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation The awful distance preserved by their neighbours attested the terror of their arms and in some measure defended them from the danger of unexpected incursions  Caesar de Bell Gall l vi    The Bructeri it is Tacitus who now speaks  fomented by the policy of Rome  were totally exterminated by the neighbouring tribes  They are mentioned however in the ivth and

deities of the empire Above sixty thousand barbarians were destroyed not by the Roman arms but in our sight and for our entertainment May the nations enemies of Rome ever preserve this enmity to each other We have now attained the utmost verge of prosperity  Urgentibus  is the common reading but good sense Lipsius and some MSS declare for  Vergentibus  and have nothing left to demand of Fortune except the discord of these barbarians  Tacit Germania c The pious AbbÃ© de la Bleterie is very angry with Tacitus talks of the devil who was a murderer from the beginning c c    These sentiments less  worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of Tacitus express the invariable maxims of the policy of his countrymen They deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to combat the barbarians from whose defeat they could derive neither honour nor advantage The money and negociations of Rome insinuated themselves into the heart of Germany and every art of seduction was used with dignity to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the Rhine or Danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most troublesome enemies Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most trifling presents which they received either as marks of distinction or as the instruments of luxury In civil dissentions the weaker faction endeavoured to strengthen its interest by entering into secret connexions with the governors of the frontier provinces Every quarrel among the Germans was fomented by the intrigues of Rome and every plan of union and public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy and interest  Many traces of this policy may be discovered in Tacitus and Dion and many more may be inferred from the principles of human nature    The general conspiracy which terrified the  Transient union against Marcus Antoninus  Romans under the reign of Marcus Antoninus comprehended almost all the nations of Germany and even Sarmatia from the mouth of the Rhine  to that of the Danube  Hist August p Ammian Marcellin l xxxi c Aurel Victor The emperor Marcus was reduced to sell the rich furniture of the palace and to inlist slaves and robbers  It is impossible for us to determine whether this hasty confederation was formed by necessity by reason or by passion but we may rest assured that the barbarians were neither allured by the indolence or provoked by the ambition of the Roman monarch This dangerous invasion required all the firmness and vigilance of Marcus He fixed generals of ability in the several stations of attack and assumed in person the conduct of the most important province on the Upper Danube After a long and doubtful conflict the spirit of the barbarians was subdued The Quadi and the Marcomanni  The Marcomanni a colony who from the banks of the Rhine occupied Bohemia and Moravia had once erected a great and formidable monarchy under their king Maroboduus See Strabo l vii Vell Pat ii Tacit Annal ii  who had taken the lead in the war were the most severely punished in its catastrophe They were commanded to retire five miles  Mr Wotton History of Rome p increases the prohibition to ten times the distance His reasoning is specious but not conclusive Five miles were sufficient for a fortified barrier  from their own banks of the Danube and to deliver up the flower of the youth who were immediately sent into Britain a remote island where they might be secure as hostages and useful as soldiers  Dion l lxxi and lxxii  On the frequent rebellions of the Quadi and Marcomanni the irritated emperor resolved to reduce their country  into the form of a province His designs were disappointed by death This formidable league however the only one that appears in the two first centuries of the Imperial history was entirely dissipated without leaving any traces behind in Germany  In the course of this introductory chapter we  Distinction of the German tribes  have confined ourselves to the general outlines of the manners of Germany without attempting to describe or to distinguish the various tribes which filled that great country in the time of Caesar of Tacitus or of Ptolemy As the ancient or as new tribes successively present themselves in the series of this history we shall concisely mention their origin their situation and their particular character Modern nations are fixed and permanent societies connected among themselves by laws and government bound to their native soil by arts and agriculture The German tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers almost of savages The same territory often changed its inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration The same communities uniting in a plan of defence or invasion bestowed a new title on their new confederacy The dissolution of an ancient confederacy restored to the independent tribes their peculiar but long forgotten appellation A victorious state often communicated its own name to a vanquished people Sometimes crowds of volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favourite leader his camp became their country and some circumstance of the enterprise soon gave a common  denomination to the mixed multitude The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were perpetually varied by themselves and confounded by the astonished subjects of the Roman empire  See an excellent dissertation on the origin and migrations of nations in the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xviii p It is seldom that the antiquarian and the philosopher are so happily blended    Wars and the administration of public affairs  Numbers  are the principal subjects of history but the number of persons interested in these busy scenes is very different according to the different condition of mankind In great monarchies millions of obedient subjects pursue their useful occupations in peace and obscurity The attention of the Writer as well as of the Reader is solely confined to a court a capital a regular army and the districts which happen to be the occasional scene of military operations But a state of freedom and barbarism the season of civil commotions or the situation of petty republics  Should we suspect that Athens contained only citizens and Sparta no more than See Hume and Wallace on the number of mankind in ancient and modern times  raises almost every member of the community into action and consequently into notice The irregular divisions and the restless motions of the people of Germany dazzle our imagination and seem to multiply their numbers The profuse enumeration of kings and warriors of armies and nations inclines us to forget that the same objects are continually repeated under a variety of appellations and that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished on the most inconsiderable objects  CHAP X  The Emperors Decius Gallus Aemilianus Valerian and GallienusThe general Irruption of the BarbariansThe thirty Tyrants  FROM

every instant of time was marked every province of the Roman world was afflicted by barbarous invaders and military tyrants and the ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution The confusion of the times and the scarcity of authentic memorials oppose equal difficulties to the historian who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration Surrounded with imperfect fragments always concise often obscure and sometimes contradictory he is reduced to collect to compare and to conjecture and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts yet the knowledge of human nature and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions might on some occasions supply the want of historical materials  There is not for instance any difficulty in conceiving that the successive murders of so  The emperor Philip  many emperors had loosened all the ties of allegiance between the prince and people that all  the generals of Philip were disposed to imitate the example of their master and that the caprice of armies long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions might every day raise to the throne the most obscure of their fellowsoldiers History can only add that the rebellion against the emperor Philip broke out in the summer of the year two hundred and fortynine among the legions of Maesia and that a subaltern officer  The expression used by Zosimus and Zonaras may signify that Marinus commanded a century a cohort or a legion  named Marinus was the object of their seditious choice Philip was alarmed He dreaded lest the treason of the Maesian army should prove the first spark of a general conflagration Distracted with the consciousness of his guilt and of his danger he communicated the intelligence to the senate A gloomy silence prevailed the effect of fear and perhaps of disaffection till at length  Services revolt victory and reign of the emperor Decius A D  Decius one of the assembly assuming a spirit worthy of his noble extraction ventured to discover more intrepidity than the emperor seemed to possess He treated the whole business with contempt as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult and Philip's rival as a phantom of royalty who in a very few days would be destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him The speedy completion of the prophecy inspired Philip with a just esteem for so able a counsellor and Decius appeared to him the only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately  subside after the murder of Marinus Decius who long resisted his own nomination seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the soldiers and his prediction was again confirmed by the event The legions of Maesia forced their judge to become their accomplice They left him only the alternative of death or the purple His subsequent conduct after that decisive measure was unavoidable He conducted or followed his army to the confines of Italy whither Philip collecting all his force to repel the formidable competitor whom he had raised up advanced to meet him The Imperial troops were superior in number  His birth at Bubalia a little village in Pannonia Eutrop ix Victor in Caesarib et Epitom seems to contradict unless it was merely accidental his supposed

Philip was either killed in the battle or put to death a few days afterwards at Verona His son and associate in the empire was massacred at Rome by the Praetorian guards and the victorious Decius with more favourable circumstances than the ambition of that age can usually plead was universally acknowledged by the senate and provinces It is reported that immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of Augustus  he had assured Philip by a private message of his innocence and loyalty solemnly protesting that on his arrival in Italy he would resign the Imperial ornaments and return to the condition of an obedient subject His professions might be sincere But in the situation where fortune had placed him it was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be forgiven  Zosimus l i p

of the Danube by the invasion of the GOTHS This is the first considerable occasion in which history mentions that great people who afterwards broke the Roman power sacked the Capitol and reigned in Gaul Spain and Italy So memorable was the part which they acted in the subversion of the Western empire that the name of GOTHS is frequently but improperly used as a general appellation of rude and warlike barbarism  In the beginning of the sixth century and after  Origin of the Goths from Scandinavia  the conquest of Italy the Goths in possession of present greatness very naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of future glory They wished to preserve the memory of their ancestors and to transmit to posterity their own atchievements The principal minister of the court of Ravenna the learned Cassiodorus gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a Gothic history which consisted of twelve books now reduced to  the imperfect abridgment of Jornandes  See the prefaces of Cassiodorus and Jornandes it is surprising that the latter should be omitted in the excellent edition published by Grotius of the Gothic writers  These writers passed with the most artful conciseness over the misfortunes of the nation celebrated its successful valour and adorned the triumph with many Asiatic trophies that more properly belonged to the people of Scythia On the faith of ancient songs the uncertain but the only memorials of barbarians they deduced the first origin of the Goths from the vast island or peninsula of Scandinavia  On the authority of Ablavius Jornandes quotes some old Gothic chronicles in verse De Reb Geticis c  That extreme country of the North was not unknown to the conquerors of Italy the ties of ancient consanguinity had been strengthened by recent offices of friendship and a Scandinavian king had cheerfully abdicated his savage greatness that he might pass the remainder of his days in the peaceful and polished court of Ravenna  Jornandes c  Many vestiges which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity attest the ancient residence of the Goths in the countries beyond the Baltic From the time of the geographer Ptolemy the southern part of Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of the less enterprising remnant of the nation and a large territory is even at present divided into east and west Gothland During the middle ages from the ninth to the twelfth century whilst Christianity was advancing with a slow progress into the north the Goths and the Swedes composed  two distinct and sometimes hostile members of the same monarchy  See in the Prolegomena of Grotius some large extracts from Adam of Bremen and SaxoGrammaticus The former wrote in the year the latter flourished about the year  The latter of these two names has prevailed without extinguishing the former The Swedes who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms have in every age claimed the kindred glory of the Goths In a moment of discontent against the court of Rome Charles the Twelfth insinuated that his victorious troops were not degenerated from their brave ancestors who had already subdued the mistress of the world

Harte's History of Gustavus vol ii p    Till the end of the eleventh century a celebrated  Religion of the Goths  temple subsisted at Upsal the most considerable town of the Swedes and Goths It was enriched with the gold which the Scandinavians had acquired in their piratical adventures and sanctified by the uncouth representations of the three principal deities the god of war the goddess of generation and the god of thunder In the general festival that was solemnized every ninth year nine animals of every species without excepting the human were sacrificed and their bleeding bodies suspended in the sacred grove adjacent to the temple  See Adam of Bremen in Grotii Prolegomenis p The temple of Upsal was destroyed by Ingo king of Sweden who began his reign in the year and about fourscore years afterwards a Christian cathedral was erected on its ruins See Dalin's History of Sweden in the Bibliotheque RaisonnÃ¨e  The only traces  that now subsist of this barbaric superstition are contained in the Edda a system of mythology compiled in Iceland about the thirteenth century and studied by the learned of Denmark and Sweden as the most valuable remains of their ancient traditions  Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity of  Institutions and death of Odin  the Edda we can easily distinguish two persons confounded under the name of Odin the god of war and the great legislator of Scandinavia The latter the Mahomet of the north instituted a religion adapted to the climate and to the people Numerous tribes on either side of the Baltic were subdued by the invincible valour of Odin by his persuasive eloquence and by the fame which he acquired of a most skilful magician The faith that he had propagated during a long and prosperous life he confirmed by a voluntary death Apprehensive of the ignominious approach of disease and infirmity he resolved to expire as became a warrior In a solemn assembly of the Swedes and Goths he wounded himself in nine mortal places hastening away as he asserted with his dying voice to prepare the feast of heroes in the palace of the god of war  Mallet Introduction Ã  l'Histoire du Dannemarc    The native and proper habitation of Odin is  Agreeable but uncertain hypothesis concerning Odin  distinguished by the appellation of Asgard The happy resemblance of that name with Asburg  or Asof  Mallet c iv p has collected from Strabo Pliny Ptolemy and Stephanus Byzantinus the vestiges of such a city and people  words of a similar signification has given rise to an historical system of so pleasing a contexture that we could almost wish to persuade ourselves of its truth It is supposed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake Maeotis till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with servitude That Odin yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden with the great design of forming in that inaccessible retreat of freedom a religion and a people which in some remote age might be subservient to his immortal revenge when his invincible Goths armed with martial fanaticism should issue in numerous swarms from the neighbourhood of the Polar circle to chastise the oppressors of mankind  This wonderful expedition of Odin which by deducing the enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a cause might supply the noble groundwork of an Epic poem cannot safely be received as authentic history According to the obvious sense of the Edda and the interpretation of the most skilful critics Asgard instead of denoting a real city of the Asiatic Sarmatia is the fictitious appellation of the mystic abode of the gods the Olympus of Scandinavia from whence the prophet was supposed to descend when he announced his new religion to the Gothic nations who were already seated in the southern parts of Sweden    If so many successive generations of Goths were  Emigration of the Goths from Scandinavia into Prussia  capable of preserving a faint tradition of their Scandinavian origin we must not expect from  such unlettered barbarians any distinct account of the time and circumstances of their emigration To cross the Baltic was an easy and natural attempt The inhabitants of Sweden were masters of a sufficient number of large vessels with oars  Tacit Germania c  and the distance is little more than one hundred miles from Carlscroon to the nearest ports of Pomerania and Prussia Here at length we land on firm and historic ground At least as early as the Christian aera  Tacit Annal ii If we could yield a firm assent to the navigations of Pytheas of Marseilles we must allow that the Goths had passed the Baltic at least three hundred years before Christ  and as late as the age of the Antonines  Ptolemy l ii  the Goths were established towards the mouth of the Vistula and in that fertile province where the commercial cities of Thorn Elbing Koningsberg and Dantzick were long afterwards founded  By the German colonies who followed the arms of the Teutonic knights The conquest and conversion of Prussia were completed by those adventurers in the xiiith century  Westward of the Goths the numerous tribes of the Vandals were spread along the banks of the Oder and the seacoast of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh A striking resemblance of manners complexion religion and language seemed to indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally one great people  Pliny Hist Natur iv and Procopius in Bell Vandal  i c agree in this opinion They lived in distant ages and possessed different means of investigating the truth  The latter appear to have been subdivided  into Ostrogoths Visigoths and Gepidae  The  Ostro  and  Visi  the eastern and western Goths obtained those denominations from their original seats in Scandinavia In all their future marches and settlements they preserved with their names the same relative situation When they first departed from Sweden the infant colony was contained in three vessels The third being a heavy sailer lagged behind and the crew which afterwards swelled into a nation received from that circumstance the appellation of Gepidae or Loiterers Jornandes c  The distinction among the Vandals was more strongly marked by the independent names of Heruli Burgundians Lombards and a variety of other petty states many of which in a future age expanded themselves into powerful monarchies  In the age of the Antonines the Goths were  From Prussia to the Ukraine  still seated in Prussia About the reign of Alexander Severus the Roman province of Dacia had already experienced their proximity by frequent and destructive inroads  See a fragment of Peter Patricius in the Excerpta Legationum and with regard to its probable date see Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iii p  In this interval therefore of about seventy years we must place the second migration of the Goths from the Baltic to the Euxine but the cause that produced it lies concealed among the various motives which actuate the conduct of unsettled barbarians Either a pestilence or a famine a victory or a defeat an oracle of the Gods or the eloquence of a daring leader were sufficient to impel the Gothic arms on the milder climates of the south Besides the influence of a martial religion the numbers and spirit of the Goths were equal to  the most dangerous adventures The use of round bucklers and short swords rendered them formidable in a close engagement the manly obedience which they yielded to hereditary kings gave uncommon union and stability to their councils  Omnium harum gentium insigne rotunda scuta breves gladii et erga reges obsequium Tacit Germania c The Goths probably acquired their iron by

states of Germany many of whom are seen a few years afterwards combating under the common standard of the Goths  The Heruli and the Uregundi or Burgundi are particularly mentioned See Mascou's History of the Germans l v A passage in the Augustan History p seems to allude to this great emigration The Marcomannic war was partly occasioned by the pressure of barbarous tribes who fled before the arms of more northern barbarians  The first motions of the emigrants carried them to the banks of the Prypec a river universally conceived by the ancients to be the southern branch of the Borysthenes  D'Anville Geographie Ancienne and the third part of his incomparable map of Europe  The windings of that great stream through the plains of Poland and Russia gave a direction to their line of march and a constant supply of fresh water and pasturage to their numerous herds of  cattle They followed the unknown course of the river confident in their valour and careless of whatever power might oppose their progress The Bastarnae and the Venedi were the first who presented themselves and the flower of their youth either from choice or compulsion increased the Gothic army The Bastarnae dwelt on the northern side of the Carpathian mountains the immense tract of land that separated the Bastarnae from the savages of Finland was possessed or rather wasted by the Venedi  Tacit Germania c  we have some reason to believe that the first of these nations which distinguished itself in the Macedonian war  Cluver Germ Antiqua l iii c  and was afterwards divided into the formidable tribes of the Peucini the Borani the Carpi c derived its origin from the Germans With better authority a Sarmatian extraction may be assigned to the Venedi who rendered themselves so famous in the middle ages  The Venedi the  Slavi  and the Antes were the three great tribes of the same people Jornandes c  But  Distinction of Germans and Sarmatians  the confusion of blood and manners on that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers  Tacitus most assuredly deserves that title and even his cautious suspense is a proof of his dilligent inquiries  As the Goths advanced near the Euxine sea they encountered a purer race of Sarmatians the Jazyges the Alani and the Roxolani and they were probably the first Germans who saw the mouths of the Borysthenes and of the Tanais If we inquire into the characteristic  marks of the people of Germany and of Sarmatia we shall discover that those two great portions of human kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or moveable tents by a close dress or flowing garments by the marriage of one or of several wives by a military force consisting for the most part either of infantry or cavalry and above all by the use of the Teutonic or of the Sclavonian language the last of which has been diffused by conquest from the confines of Italy to the neighbourhood of Japan  The Goths were now in possession of the Ukraine  Description of the Ukraine  a country of considerable extent and uncommon fertility intersected with navigable rivers which from either side discharge themselves into the Borysthenes and interspersed with large and lofty forests of oaks The plenty of game and fish the innumerable beehives deposited in the hollow of old trees and in the cavities of rocks and forming even in that rude age a valuable branch of commerce the size of the cattle the temperature of the air the aptness of the soil for every species of grain and the luxuriancy of the vegetation all displayed the liberality of Nature and tempted the industry of man  Genealogical History of the Tartars p Mr Bell vol ii p traversed the Ukraine in his journey from Petersburgh to Constantinople The modern face of the country is a just representation of the ancient since in the hands of the Cossacks it still remains in a state of nature  But the Goths withstood all these temptations and still adhered to a life of idleness of poverty and of rapine  The Scythian hords which towards the east bordered on the new settlements of the Goths presented nothing to their arms except the doubtful  The Goths invade the Roman provinces  chance of an unprofitable victory But the prospect of the Roman territories was far more alluring and the fields of Dacia were covered with rich harvests sown by the hands of an industrious and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike people It is probable that the conquests of Trajan maintained by his successors less for any real advantage than for ideal dignity had contributed to weaken the empire on that side The new and unsettled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to resist nor rich enough to satiate the rapaciousness of the barbarians As long as the remote banks of the Niester were considered as the boundary of the Roman power the fortifications of the Lower Danube were more carelessly guarded and the inhabitants of Maesia lived in supine security fondly conceiving themselves at an inaccessible distance from any barbarian invaders The irruptions of the Goths under the reign of Philip fatally convinced them of their mistake The king or leader of that sierce nation traversed with contempt the province of Dacia and passed both the Niester and the Danube without encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops betrayed the most important posts where they were stationed and the fear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to inlist  under the Gothic standard The various multitude of barbarians appeared

this palpable error of the scribe could escape the judicious correction of Grotius  The inhabitants consented to ransom their lives and property by the payment of a large sum of money and the invaders retreated back into their deserts animated rather than satisfied with the first success of their arms against an opulent but feeble country Intelligence was soon transmitted to the emperor Decius that Cniva king of the Goths had passed the Danube a second time with more considerable forces that his numerous detachments scattered devastation over the province of Maesia whilst the main body of the army consisting of seventy thousand Germans and Sarmatians a force equal to the most daring atchievements required the presence of the Roman monarch and the exertion of his military power  Decius

the same time when Decius was struggling  Decius revives the office of censor in the person of Valerian  with the violence of the tempest his mind calm and deliberate amidst the tumult of war investigated the more general causes that since the age of the Antonines had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman greatness He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace that greatness on a permanent basis without restoring public virtue ancient principles and manners and the oppressed majesty of the laws To execute this noble but arduous design he first resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor an office which as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity had so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state  Montesquieu Grandeur et Decadence des Romains c viii He illustrates the nature and use of the censorship with his usual ingenuity and with uncommon precision  till it was usurped and gradually neglected  by the Caesars  Vespasian and Titus were the last censors Pliny Hist Natur vii Censorinus de Die Natali The modesty of Trajan refused an honour which he deserved and his example became a law to the Antonines See Pliny's Panegyric c and  Conscious that the favour of the sovereign may confer power but that the esteem of the people can alone bestow authority he submitted the choice of the censor to the unbiassed voice of the senate By their unanimous  A D th October  votes or rather acclamations Valerian who was afterwards emperor and who then served with distinction in the army of Decius was declared the most worthy of that exalted honour As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the emperor he assembled a great council in his camp and before the investiture of the censor elect he apprized him of the difficulty and importance of his great office  Happy Valerian said the prince to his distinguished subject happy in the general approbation of the senate and of the Roman republic Accept the censorship of mankind and judge of our manners You will select those who deserve to continue members of the senate you will restore the equestrian order to its ancient splendour you will improve the revenue yet moderate the public burdens You will distinguish into regular classes the various and infinite multitude of citizens and accurately review the military strength the wealth the virtue and the resources of Rome Your decisions shall obtain the force of laws The army the palace the ministers of justice  and the great officers of the empire are all subject to your tribunal None are exempted excepting only the ordinary consuls  Yet in spite of this exemption Pompey appeared before that tribunal during his consulship The occasion indeed was equally singular and honourable Plutarch in Pomp p  the prefect of the city the king of the sacrifices and as long as she preserves her chastity inviolate the eldest of the vestal virgins Even these few who may not dread the severity will anxiously solicit the esteem of the Roman censor  See the original speech in the Augustan Hist p    A magistrate invested with such extensive  The design impracticable and without effect  powers would have appeared not so much the minister as the colleague of his sovereign  This transaction might deceive Zonaras who supposes that Valerian was actually declared the colleague of Decius l xii p  Valerian justly dreaded an elevation so full of envy and of suspicion He modestly urged the alarming greatness of the trust his own insusficiency and the incurable corruption of the times He artfully insinuated that the office of censor was inseparable from the Imperial dignity and that the feebel hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense weight of cares and of power  Hist August p The emperor's reply is omitted  The approaching event of war soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious but so impracticable and whilst it preserved Valerian from the danger saved the emperor Decius from the disappointment which would most probably have attended  it A censor may maintain he can never restore the morals of a state It is impossible for such a magistrate to exert his authority with benefit or even with effect unless he is supported by a quick sense of honour and virtue in the minds of the people by a decent reverence for the public opinion and by a train of useful prejudices combating on the side of national manners In a period when these principles are annihilated the censorial jurisdiction must either sink into empty pageantry or be converted into a partial instrument of vexatious oppression  Such as the attempts of Augustus towards a reformation of manners Tacit Annal iii  It was easier to vanquish the Goths than to eradicate the public vices yet even in the first of these enterprises Decius lost his army and his life  The Goths were now on every side surrounded  Defeat and death of Decius and his son  and pursued by the Roman arms The flower of their troops had perished in the long siege of Philippopolis and the exhausted country could no longer afford subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious barbarians Reduced to this extremity the Goths would gladly have purchased by the surrender of all their booty and prisoners the permission of an undisturbed retreat But the emperor confident of victory and resolving by the chastisement of these invaders to strike a salutary terror into the nations of the North refused to listen to any terms of accommodation The highspirited barbarians preferred death to slavery An obscure  town of Maesia called Forum Terebronii  Tillemont Histoire des Empereurs tom iii p As Zosimus and some of his followers mistake the Danube for the Tanais they place the field of battle in the plains of Scythia  was the scene of the battle The Gothic army was drawn up in three lines and either from choice or accident the front of the third line was covered by a morass In the beginning of the action the son of Decius a youth of the fairest hopes and already associated to the honours of the purple was slain by an arrow in the sight of his afflicted father who summoning all his fortitude admonished the dismayed troops that the loss of a single soldier was of little importance to the republic  Aurelius Victor allows two distinct actions for the deaths of the two Decii but I have preferred the account of Jornandes  The conflict was terrible it was the combat of despair against grief and rage The first line of the Goths at length gave way in disorder the second advancing to sustain it shared its fate and the third only remained entire prepared to dispute the passage of the morass which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the enemy  Here the fortune of the day turned and all things became adverse to the Romans the place deep with ooze sinking under those who stood slippery to such as advanced their armour heavy the waters deep nor could they wield in that uneasy situation their weighty javelins The barbarians on the contrary were enured to encounters in the bogs their persons tall their spears long such as could wound at a  distance  I have ventured to copy from Tacitus Annal i the picture of a similar engagement between a Roman army and a German tribe    In this morass the Roman army after an ineffectual struggle was irrecoverably lost nor could the body of the emperor ever be found  Jornandes c Zosimus l i p Zonaras l xii p Aurelius Victor  Such was the fate of Decius in the fiftieth year of his age an accomplished prince active in war and

wealth of nations had centred in Rome the emperors displayed their greatness and even their policy by the regular exercise of a steady and moderate liberality towards the allies of the state They relieved the poverty of the barbarians honoured their merit and recompensed their fidelity These voluntary marks of bounty were understood to flow not from the fears but merely from the generosity  or the gratitude of the Romans and whilst presents and subsidies were liberally distributed among friends and suppliants they were sternly refused to such as claimed them as a debt  See the firmness of a

disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed to accept such unequal laws from a tribe of barbarians and the prince who by a necessary concession had

Imperial purple as the reward of military merit But instead of making a judicious choice which would have confirmed his reign and endeared his memory Valerian consulting only the dictates of affection or vanity immediately invested with the supreme honours his son Gallienus a youth whose effeminate vices had been hitherto concealed by the obscurity of a private station The joint government of the father and the son subsisted about seven and the sole administration of Gallienus continued about eight years But the whole period was one uninterrupted series of confusion and calamity As the Roman empire was at the same time and on every side attacked by the blind fury of foreign invaders and the wild ambition of domestic  usurpers we shall consult order and perspicuity by pursuing not so much

their wars and conquests  One of the Victors calls him King of the MÃ¡rcomanni the other of the Germans  To the father as the price of his alliance he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia The native charms of unpolished beauty seem to have fixed the daughter in the affections of the inconstant emperor and the bands of policy were more firmly connected by those of love But the haughty

the just result of knowledge and experience Warriors of such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the cowardice of their guides who required the strongest assurances of a settled calm

and populous a double enclosure of walls seemed to defy the fury of the Goths and the usual garrison had been strengthened by a reinforcement of ten thousand men But there are not any advantages capable of supplying the absence of discipline and vigilance The numerous garrison of Trebizond dissolved in riot and luxury disdained to guard their impregnable fortifications The Goths soon discovered the supine negligence of the besieged erected a lofty pile of fascines ascended the walls in the silence of the night and entered the defenceless city sword in hand A general massacre of the people ensued whilst the affrighted soldiers escaped through the opposite gates of the town The most holy temples and the most splendid edifices were involved in a common destruction The booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was immense the wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in Trebizond as in a secure place of refuge The number of captives was incredible as the victorious barbarians ranged without opposition through the extensive province of Pontus  See an epistle of Gregory Thaumaturgus bishop of NeoCaesarea quoted by Mascou v  The rich spoils of Trebizond filled a great fleet of ships that had been found in the port The robust youth of the  seacoast were chained to the oar and the Goths satisfied with the success of their first naval expedition

Niester and the Danube and increasing their fleet by the capture of a great number of fishing barks they approached the narrow outlet through which the Euxine sea pours its waters into the

The season was rainy and the lake Apolloniates the reservoir of all the springs of Mount Olympus rose to an uncommon height The little river of Rhyndacus which issues from the lake swelled into a broad and rapid stream and stopped the progress of the Goths Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea where the fleet had probably been stationed was attended by a long train of waggons laden with the spoils of Bithynia and was marked by the flames of Nice and Nicodemia which they wantonly burnt  Zosimus l i p  Some obscure hints are mentioned of a doubtful combat that secured their retreat  Syncellus tells an unintelligible story of Prince  Odenathus  who defeated the Goths and who was killed by Prince  Odenathus  But even a complete victory would have been of little moment as

not capable of containing more than twentyfive or thirty men we may safely affirm that fifteen thousand warriors at the most embarked in this great expedition Impatient of the limits of the Euxine

They pass the Bosphorus and the Hellespont  a favourable wind springing up the next day carried them in a few hours into the placid sea or rather lake of the Propontis Their landing on the little island of Cyzicus was attended with the ruin of that ancient and noble city From thence issuing again through the narrow passage of the Hellespont they pursued their winding navigation amidst the numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago or the Aegean Sea The assistance of captives and deserters must have been very necessary to pilot their vessels and to direct their various incursions as well on the coast of Greece as on that of Asia At length the Gothic fleet anchored in the port of Piraeus five miles distant from Athens  Plin Hist Natur iii  which had attempted to make some preparations for a vigorous defence Cleodamus one of the engineers employed by the emperor's orders to fortify the maritime cities against the Goths had already begun to repair the ancient walls fallen to decay since the time of  Sylla The efforts of his skill were ineffectual and the barbarians became masters of the native seat of the muses and the arts But while the conquerors abandoned themselves to the license of plunder and intemperance their fleet that lay with a slender guard in the harbour of Piraeus was unexpectedly attacked by the brave Dexippus who flying with the engineer Cleodamus from the sack of Athens collected a hasty band of volunteers peasants as well as soldiers and in some measure avenged the calamities of his country  Hist August p Victor c Orosius vii Zofimus l i p Zonaras l xii Syncellus p It is not without some attention that we can explain and conciliate their imperfect hints We can still discover some traces of the partiality of Dexippus in the relation of his own and his countrymen's exploits    But this exploit whatever lustre it might shed on the declining age of Athens served rather to  ravage Greece and threaten Italy  irritate than to subdue the undaunted spirit of the northern invaders A general conflagration blazed out at the same time in every district of Greece Thebes and Argos Corinth and Sparta which had formerly waged such memorable wars against each other were now unable to bring an army into the field or even to defend their ruined fortifications The rage of war both by land and by sea spread from the eastern point of Sunium to the western coast of Epirus The Goths had already advanced within sight of Italy when the approach of such imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of pleasure The emperor appeared in arms  and his presence seems to have checked the ardour and to have divided the strength of the enemy Naulobatus a chief of the Heruli accepted  Their divisions and retreat  an honourable capitulation entered with a large body of his countrymen into the service of Rome and was invested with the ornaments of the consular dignity which had never before been profaned by the hands of a barbarian  Syncellus p This body of Heruli was for a long time faithful and famous  Great numbers of the Goths disgusted with the perils and hardships of a tedious voyage broke into Maesia with a design of forcing their way over the Danube to their settlements in the Ukraine The wild attempt would have proved inevitable destruction if the discord of the Roman generals had not opened to the barbarians the means of an escape  Claudius who commanded on the Danube thought with propriety and acted with spirit His colleague was jealous of his fame Hist August p  The small remainder of this destroying host returned on board their vessels and measuring back their way through the Hellespont and the Bosphorus ravaged in their passage the shores of Troy whose fame immortalized by Homer will probably survive the memory of the Gothic conquests As soon as they found themselves in safety within the bason of the Euxine they landed at Anchialus in Thrace near the foot of Mount Haemus and after all their toils indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths What remained  of the voyage was a short and easy navigation  Jornandes c  Such was the various fate of this third and greatest of their naval enterprises It may seem difficult to conceive how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure But as their numbers were gradually wasted by the sword by shipwrecks and by the influence of a warm climate they were pepetually renewed by troops of banditti and deserters who flocked to the standard of plunder and by a crowd of fugitive slaves often of German or Sarmatian extraction who eagerly seized the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge In these expeditions the Gothic nation claimed a superior share of honour and danger but the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners are sometimes distinguished and sometimes confounded in the imperfect histories of that age and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from the mouth of the Tanais the vague but familiar appellation of Scythians was frequently bestowed on the mixt multitude  Zosimus and the Greeks as the author of the Philopatris give the name of Scythians to those whom Jornandes and the Latin writers constantly represent as Goths    In the general calamities of mankind the death  Ruin of the temple of Ephesus  of an individual however exalted the ruin of an edifice however famous are passed over with careless inattention Yet we cannot forget that the temple of Diana at Ephesus after having risen with increasing splendour from seven repeated  misfortunes  Hist August p Jornandes c  was finally burnt by the Goths in their third naval invasion The arts of Greece and the wealth of Asia had conspired to erect that sacred and magnificent structure It was supported by an hundred and twentyseven marble columns of the Ionic order They were the gifts of devout monarchs and each was sixty feet high The altar was adorned with the masterly sculptures of Praxiteles who had perhaps selected from the favourite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona the concealment of Apollo after the slaughter of the Cyclops and the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons  Strabo l xiv p Vitruvius l i c praefat l vii Tacit Annal iii Plin Hist Nat xxxvi  Yet the length of the temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twentyfive feet about twothirds of the measure of the church of St Peter's at Rome  The length of St Peter's is Roman palms each palm is very little short of nine English inches See Greaves's Miscellanies vol i p On the Roman foot  In the other dimensions it was still more inferior to that sublime production of modern architecture The spreading arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth than the oblong temples of the Pagans and the boldest artists of antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raising in the air a dome of the size and proportions of the pantheon The temple of Diana was however admired as one of the wonders of the world Successive empires the Persian the  Macedonian and the Roman had revered its sanctity and enriched its splendour  The policy however of the Romans induced them to abridge the extent of the sanctuary or asylum which by successive privileges had spread itself two stadia round the temple Strabo l xiv p Tacit Annal iii c  But the rude savages of the Baltic were destitute of a taste for the elegant arts and they despised the ideal terrors of a foreign superstition  They offered no

suspected as the fanciful conceit of a recent sophist We are told that in the sack of Athens the Goths had collected all the libraries and were on the point of setting fire to this funeral pile of Grecian learning had not one of their chiefs of more refined policy than his brethren dissuaded them from the design by the profound observation that as long as the Greeks were addicted to the study of books they would never apply themselves to the exercise of arms  Zonaras l xii p Such an anecdote was perfectly suited to the taste of Montaigne He makes use of it in his agreeable Essay on Pedantry l i c  The sagacious counsellor should the truth of the fact be admitted reasoned like an ignorant barbarian In the most polite and powerful nations genius of every kind has displayed itself about the same period and the age of science has generally been the age of military virtue and success  IV The new sovereigns of Persia Artaxerxes and his son Sapor had triumphed as we have already seen over the house of Arsaces Of the  Conquest of Armenia by the Persians  many princes of that ancient race Chosroes king of Armenia had alone preserved both his life and his independence He defended himself by the natural strength of his country by the perpetual resort of fugitives and malecontents by the alliance of the Romans and above all by his own courage Invincible in arms during a thirty years war he was at length assassinated by the emissaries of Sapor king of Persia The patriotic satraps of Armenia who asserted the freedom and dignity of the crown implored the protection of Rome in favour of Tiridates the lawful heir But the son of Chosroes was an infant the allies were at a distance and the Persian monarch advanced towards the frontier at the head of an irresistible force Young Tiridates the future hope of his country was saved by the fidelity of a servant and Armenia continued above twentyseven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy of Persia  Moses Chorenensis l ii c Zonaras l xii p The authentic relation of the Armenian historian serves to rectify the confused account of the Greek The latter talks of the children of Tiridates who at that time was himself an infant  Elated with this easy conquest and presuming on the distresses or the degeneracy of the Romans Sapor obliged the strong garrisons of Carrhae and Nisibis to surrender and spread devastation and terror on either side of the Euphrates  The loss of an important frontier the ruin of a faithful and natural ally and the rapid success of Sapor's ambition affected Rome with a deep  Valerian marches into the East  sense of the insult as well as of the danger Valerian flattered himself that the vigilance of his lieutenants would sufficiently provide for the safety of the Rhine and of the Danube but he resolved notwithstanding his advanced age to march in person to the defence of the Euphrates During his progress through Asia Minor the naval enterprises of the Goths were suspended and the afflicted province enjoyed a transient and fallacious calm He passed the Euphrates encountered the Persian monarch near the walls of Edessa was vanquished and taken prisoner by Sapor The particulars of this great event are  Is defeated and taken prisoner by Sapor king of Persia A D  darkly and imperfectly represented yet by the glimmering light which is afforded us we may discover a long series of imprudence of error and of deserved misfortunes on the side of the Roman emperor He reposed an implicit confidence in Macrianus his Praetorian praefect  Hist August p As Macrianus was an enemy to the Christians they charged him with being a magician  That worthless minister rendered his master formidable only to the oppressed subjects and contemptible to the enemies of Rome  Zosimus l i p  By his weak or wicked counsels the Imperial army was betrayed into a situation where valour and military skill were equally unavailing  Hist August p  The vigorous attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the Persian host was repulsed with great  slaughter  Victor in Caesar Eutropius ix  and Sapor who encompassed the camp with superior numbers patiently waited till the increasing rage of famine and pestilence had ensured his victory The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused Valerian as the cause of their calamities their seditious clamours demanded an instant capitulation An immense sum of gold was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat But the Persian conscious of his superiority refused the money with disdain and detaining the deputies advanced in order of battle to the foot of the Roman rampart and insisted on a personal conference with the emperor Valerian was reduced to the necessity of intrusting his life and dignity to the faith of an enemy The interview ended as it was natural to expect The emperor was made a prisoner and his astonished troops laid down their arms  Zosimus l i p Zonarus l xii p Peter Patricius in the Excerpta Legat p  In such a moment of triumph the pride and policy of Sapor prompted him to fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on his pleasure Cyriades an obscure fugitive of Antioch stained with every vice was chosen to dishonour the Roman purple and the will of the Persian victor could not fail of being ratified by the acclamations however reluctant of the captive army  Hist August p The reign of Cyriades appears in that collection prior to the death of Valerian but I have preferred a probable series of events to the doubtful chronology of a most in  ccurate writer    The imperial slave was eager to secure the favour of his master by an act of treason to his native country He conducted Sapor over the  Sapor overruns Syria Cilicia and Cappadocia  Euphrates and by the way of Chalcis to the metropolis of the East So rapid were the motions of the Persian cavalry that if we may credit a very judicious historian  The sack of Antioch anticipated by some historians is assigned by the decisive testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus to the reign of Gallienus xxiii  the city of Antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amusements of the theatre The splendid buildings of Antioch private as well as public were either pillaged or destroyed and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword or led away into captivity  Zosimus l i p  The tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes he appeared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants armed only with slings and defended his god and his property from the sacrilegious hands of the followers of Zoroaster  John Malala tom i p He corrupts this probable event by some fabulous circumstances  But the ruin of Tarsus and of many other cities furnishes a melancholy proof that except in this singular instance the conquest of Syria and Cilicia scarcely interrupted the progress of the Persian arms The advantages of the narrow passes of mount Taurus were abandoned in which an invader whose principal force consisted in his cavalry would have been engaged in a very unequal combat  and Sapor was permitted to form the sie geof Caesarea the capital of Cappadocia a city though of the second rank which was supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants Demosthenes commanded in the place not so much by the commission of the emperor as in the voluntary defence of his country For a long time he deferred its fate and when at last Caesarea was betrayed by the perfidy of a physician he cut his way through the Persians who had been ordered to exert their utmost diligence to take him alive This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who might either have honoured or punished his obstinate valour but many thousands of his fellowcitizens were involved in a general massacre and Sapor is accused of treating his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cruelty  Zonaras l xii p Deep vallies were filled up with the slain Crowds of prisoners were driven to water like beasts and many perished for want of food  Much should undoubtedly be allowed for national animosity much for humbled pride and impotent revenge yet upon the whole it is certain that the same prince who in Armenia had displayed the mild aspect of a legislator shewed himself to the Romans under the stern features of a conqueror He despaired of making any permanent establishment in the empire and sought only to leave behind him a wasted desert whilst he transported into Persia the people and the treasures of the provinces  Zosimus l i p asserts that Sapor had he not preferred spoil to conquest might have remained master of Asia    At the time when the East trembled at the name of Sapor he received a present not unworthy of the greatest kings a long train of camels  Boldness and success of Odenathus against Sapor  laden with the most rare and valuable merchandises The rich offering was accompanied with an epistle respectful but not servile from Odenathus one of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra  Who is this Odenathus said the haughty Victor and he commanded that the presents should be cast into the Euphrates that he thus insolently presumes to write to his lord If he entertains a hope of mitigating his punishment let him fall prostrate before the foot of our throne with his hands bound behind his back Should he hesitate swift destruction shall be poured on his head on his whole race and on his country  Peter Patricius in Excerpt Leg p

Arab of Palmyra  The voice of history which is often little  Treatment of Valerian  more than the organ of hatred or flattery reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the rights of conquest We are told that Valerian in chains but invested with the Imperial purple was exposed to the multitude a constant spectacle of fallen greatness and that whenever the Persian monarch mounted on horseback he placed his foot on the neck of a Roman emperor Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his allies who repeatedly advised him to remember the vicissitude of fortune to dread the returning power of Rome and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of peace not the object of insult Sapor still remained inflexible When Valerian sunk under the weight of shame and grief his skin stuffed with straw and formed into the likeness of a human figure was preserved for ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia a more real monument of triumph than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so often erected by Roman vanity  The Pagan writers lament the Christian insult the misfortunes of Valerian Their various testimonies are accurately collected by Tillemont tom iii p c So little has been preserved of eastern history before Mahomet that the modern Persians are totally ignorant of the victory of Sapor an event so glorious to their nation See Bibliotheque Orientale  The tale is moral and  pathetic but the truth of it may very fairly be called in question The letters still extant from the princes of the East to Sapor are manifest forgeries  One of these epistles is from Artavasdes king of Armenia since Armenia was then a province in Persia the king the kingdom and the epistle must be fictitious  nor is it natural to suppose that a jealous monarch should even in the person of a rival thus publicly degrade the majesty of kings Whatever treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia it is at least certain that the only emperor of Rome who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy languished away his life in hopeless captivity  The emperor Gallienus who had long supported  Character and administration of Gallienus  with impatience the censorial severity of

every art that he attempted his lively genius  enabled him to succeed and as his genius was destitute of judgment he attempted every art except the important ones of war and government He was a master of several curious but useless sciences a ready orator and elegant poet  There is still extant a very pretty Epithalamium composed by Gallienus for the nuptials of his nephews  Ite ait O Juvenes

title of Augusta On a medal in the French king's collection we read a similar inscription of  Faustina Augusta  round the head of Marcus Aurelius With regard to the  Ubique Pax  it is easily explained by the vanity of Gallienus who seized perhaps the occasion of some momentary calm See Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres Janvier p  The  repeated intelligence of invasions defeats and rebellions he received with a careless smile and singling out with affected contempt some particular production of the lost province he carelessly asked whether Rome must be ruined unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt and Arras cloth from Gaul There were however a few short moments in the life of Gallienus when exasperated by some recent injury he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant till satiated with blood or fatigued by resistance he insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his character  This singular character has I believe been fairly transmitted to us The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus    At a time when the reins of government were  The thirty tyrants  held with so loose a hand it is not surprising that a crowd of usurpers should start up in every province of the empire against the son of Valerian It was probably some ingenious fancy of comparing the thirty tyrants of Rome with the thirty tyrants of Athens that induced the writers of the Augustan history to select that celebrated number which has been gradually received into a popular appellation  Pollio expresses the most minute anxiety to complete the number  But in every light the parallel is idle and defective What resemblance can we discover between a council  of thirty persons the united oppressors of a single city and an uncertain list of independent rivals who rose and fell in irregular succession through the extent of a vast empire Nor can the number of thirty be completed unless we include in the account the women and children who were honoured with the Imperial title The reign of Gallienus distracted as it was produced only nineteen pretenders to the throne Cyriades  Their real number was no more than nineteen  Macrianus Balista Odenathus and Zenobia in the east in Gaul and the western provinces Posthumus Lollianus Victorinus and his mother Victoria Marius and Tetricus In Illyricum and the confines of the Danube Ingenuus Regillianus and Aureolus in

in Achaia Aemilianus in Egypt and Celsus in Africa To illustrate the obscure monuments of the life and death of each individual would prove a laborious task alike barren of instruction and of amusement We may content ourselves with investigating some general characters that most strongly mark the condition of the times and the manners of the men their pretensions their motives their fate and the destructive consequences of their usurpation  Tillemont tom iii p reckons them somewhat differently    It is sufficiently known that the odious appellation  Character and merit of the tyrants  of  Tyrant  was often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of supreme  power without any reference to the abuse of it Several of the pretenders who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor Gallienus were shining models of virtue and almost all possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability Their merit had recommended them to the favour of Valerian and gradually promoted them to the most important commands of the empire The generals who assumed the title of Augustus were either respected by their troops for their able conduct and severe discipline or admired for valour and success in war or beloved for frankness and generosity The field of victory was often the scene of their election and even the armourer Marius the most contemptible of all the candidates for the purple was distinguished however by intrepid courage matchless strength and blunt honesty  See the speech of Marius in the Augustan History p The accidental identity of names was

even an enemy ought to have respected the sanctity of Piso and although he died in arms against Gallienus the senate with the emperor's generous permission decreed the triumphal ornaments to the

rebellion by their fears than urged to it by their ambition They dreaded the cruel suspicions of Gallienus they equally dreaded the capricious violence of their troops If the dangerous favour of the army had imprudently declared them deserving of the purple they were marked for sure destruction and even prudence would counsel them to secure a short enjoyment of empire and rather to try the

were justified  Their violent deaths  by the repeated experience of revolutions Of the nineteen tyrants who started up under the reign of Gallienus there was not one who enjoyed a life of peace or a natural death As soon as they were invested with the bloody purple they inspired their adherents with the same fears and ambition which had occasioned their own revolt Encompassed with domestic conspiracy military sedition and civil war they trembled on the edge of precipices in which after a longer or shorter term of anxiety they were inevitably lost These precarious monarchs  received however such honours as the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could bestow but their claim founded on rebellion could never obtain the sanction of law or history Italy Rome and the senate constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus and he alone was considered as the sovereign of the empire That prince condescended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus who deserved the honourable distinction by the respectful conduct which he always maintained towards the son of Valerian With the general applause of the Romans and the consent of Gallienus the senate conferred the title of Augustus on the brave Palmyrenian and seemed to intrust him with the government of the East which he already possessed in so independent a manner that like a private succession he bequeathed it to his illustrious widow Zenobia  The association of the brave Palmyrenian was the most popular act of the whole reign of Gallienus Hist August p    The rapid and perpetual

remain indifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind The election of these precarious emperors their power and their death were equally destructive to their subjects and adherents The price of their fatal elevation was instantly discharged to the troops by an immense donative drawn from the bowels of the exhausted  people However virtuous was their character however pure their intentions they found themselves reduced to the hard necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty When they fell they involved armies and provinces in their fall There is still extant a most savage mandate from Gallienus to one of his ministers after the suppression of Ingenuus who had assumed the purple in Illyricum  It is not enough says that soft but inhuman prince that you exterminate such as have appeared in arms the chance of battle might have served me as effectually The male sex of every age must be extirpated provided that in the execution of the children and

feelings  Hist August p    Whilst the public forces of the state were dissipated in private quarrels  the defenceless provinces lay exposed to every invader The bravest usurpers were compelled by the perplexity of their situation to conclude ignominious treaties with the common enemy to purchase with oppressive tributes the neutrality or services of the barbarians and to introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the Roman monarchy  Regillianus had some bands of Roxolani in his service Posthumus a body of Franks It was perhaps in the character of auxiliaries that the latter introduced themselves into Spain    Such were the barbarians and such the tyrants who under the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus dismembered the provinces and reduced the empire to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin from whence it seemed impossible that it should ever emerge As far as the barrenness of materials would permit we have attempted to trace with order and perspicuity the general events of that calamitous period There still remain some particular facts I The disorders of Sicily II The tumults of Alexandria and III The rebellion of the Isaurians which may serve to reflect a strong light on the horrid picture  I Whenever numerous troops of banditti  Disorders of Sicily  multiplied by success and impunity publicly defy instead of eluding the justice of their country we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the community The situation of Sicily preserved it from the barbarians nor could the disarmed province have supported an usurper The sufferings of that  once flourishing and still fertile island were inflicted by baser hands A licentious crowd of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered country and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more ancient times  The Augustan History p calls it  servile bellum  See Diodor Sicul l xxxiv  Devastations of which the husbandman was either the victim or the accomplice must have ruined the agriculture of Sicily and as the principal estates were the property of the opulent senators of Rome who often enclosed within a farm the territory of an old republic it is not improbable that this private injury might affect the capital more deeply than all the conquests of the Goths or the Persians  II The foundation of

This long and terrible sedition was first occasioned by a dispute between a soldier and a townsman about a pair of shoes  After the captivity of Valerian and the insolence of his son had relaxed the authority of the laws the Alexandrians abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage of their passions and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil war which continued with a few short and suspicious truces above twelve years  Dionysius apud Euseb Hist Eccles vol vii p Ammian xxii  All intercourse was cut off between the several quarters of the afflicted city every street was polluted with blood every building of strength converted into a citadel nor did the tumults subside till a considerable part of Alexandria was irretrievably ruined The spacious and magnificent district of

petty province of Asia Minor was attended with strange and memorable consequences The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an officer of Gallienus but his followers despairing of mercy resolved to

heart of the Roman monarchy the Isaurians long continued a nation of wild barbarians Succeeding princes unable to reduce them to obedience either by arms or policy were compelled to acknowledge their

prodigies fictitious or exaggerated  Hist August p  But a long and general famine was a calamity of a more serious kind It was the inevitable consequence of rapine and oppression which extirpated the produce of the present and the hope of future harvests Famine is almost always followed by epidemical diseases the effect of scanty and unwholesome food Other causes must however have contributed to the furious plague which from the year two hundred and fifty to the year two hundred and sixtyfive raged without interruption in every province every city and almost every family of the Roman empire During some time five thousand persons died daily in Rome and many towns that had escaped the hands of the barbarians were entirely depopulated  Hist Angust p Zosimus l i p Zonaras l xii p Euseb

fact is taken from the Letters of Dionysius who in the time of those troubles was bishop of Alexandria  Applying this authentic fact to the most correct tables of mortality it evidently proves that above half the people of Alexandria had perished and could we venture to extend the analogy to the other provinces we might suspect that war pestilence and famine had consumed in a few years the
