 NIGHT AN EPISTLE TO ROBERT LLOYD BY THE AUTHOR  CONTRARIUS EVEHOR ORBI  OVID  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Gate Holborn M DCC LXI  Price ONE SHILLING  NIGHT  _WHEN foes insult and  prudent  friends dispense  In pity's strains the worst of insolence  Oft with thee LLOYD I steal an hour from grief  And in thy social converse find relief  The mind of solitude impatient grown  Loves any sorrows rather than her own  LET slaves to business bodies without soul  Important blanks in Nature's mighty roll  Solemnize nonsense in the day's broad glare  We NIGHT prefer which heals or hides our care  ROGUES justified and by success made bold  Dull fools and coxcombs sanctified by Gold  Freely may bask in fortune's partial ray  And spread their feathers op'ning to the day  But  threadbare  Merit dares not shew the head  'Till vain Prosperity retires to bed  Missortunes like the Owl avoid the light  The sons of CARE are always sons of NIGHT  THE Wretch bred up in Method's drowsy school  Whose only merit is to err by rule  Who ne'er thro' heat of blood was tripping caught  Nor guilty deem'd of one eccentric thought  Whose soul directed to no use is seen  Unless to move the body's dull Machine  Which clockwork like with the same equal pace  Still travels on thro' life's insipid space  Turns up his eyes to think that there should be  Among God's creatures too such things as  we  Then for his nightcap calls and thanks the pow'rs  Which kindly give him grace to keep  good hours  Good hours  Fine wordsbut was it ever seen  That all men could agree in what they mean  FLORIO who many years a course hath run  In downright opposition to the sun  Expatiates on  good hours  their cause defends  With as much vigour as our PRUDENT FRIENDS  Th' uncertain term no settled notion brings  But still in diff'rent mouths mean diff'rent things  Each takes the phrase in his own private view  With PRUDENCE it is ten with FLORIO two  Go on ye fools who talk for talking sake  Without distinguishing distinctions make  Shine forth in native folly native pride  Make yourselves rules to all the world beside  Reason collected in herself disdains  The slavish yoke of arbitrary chains  Steady and true each circumstance she weighs  Nor to bare  words  inglorious tribute pays  Men of sense live exempt from vulgar awe  And Reason to herself alone is law  That freedom she enjoys with lib'ral mind  Which she as freely grants to all mankind  No idol titled name her rev'rence stirs  No hour she blindly to the rest prefers  All are alike if they're alike employ'd  And all are good if  virtuously  enjoy'd  LET the sage DOCTOR think him one we know  With scraps of antient learning overflow  In all the dignity of  wig  declare  The fatal consequence of midnight air  How damps and vapours as it were by stealth  Undermine life and sap the walls of health  For me let GALEN moulder on the shelf  I'll live and be physician to myself  Whilst soul is join'd to body whether fate  Allot a longer or a shorter date  I'll make them live as brother should with brother  And keep them in good humour with each other  THE surest road to health say what they will  Is never to suppose we shall be ill  Most of those evils we poor mortals know  From doctors and imagination flow  Hence to old women with your boasted rules  Stale traps and only sacred now to fools  As well may sons of physic hope to find  One medicine as one hour for all mankind  IF RUPERT after ten is out of bed  The fool next morning can't hold up his head  What reason this which  me  to bed must call  Whose head thank heaven never aches at all  In diff'rent courses diff'rent tempers run  He hates the Moon I sicken at the sun  Wound up at twelve at noon  his  clock goes right  Mine  better goes wound up at twelve at night  THEN in Oblivion's grateful cup I drown  The galling sneer the supercilious frown  The strange reserve the proud affected state  Of upstart knaves grown rich and fools grown great  No more that abject wretch disturbs my rest  Who meanly overlooks a friend distrest  Purblind to poverty the Worldling goes  And scarce sees rags an inch beyond his nose  But from a croud can single out his grace  And cringe and creep to fools who strut in lace  WHETHER those classic regions are survey'd  Where we in earliest youth together stray'd  Where hand in hand we trod the flow'ry shore  Tho' now thy happier genius runs before  When we conspir'd a thankless wretch to raise  And taught a  stump  to shoot with pilser'd praise  Who once for  Rev'rend  merit famous grown  Gratefully strove to kick his MAKER down  Or if more gen'ral arguments engage  The court or camp the pulpit bar or stage  If halfbred surgeons whom men doctors call  And lawyers who were never bred at all  Those mightyletter'd monsters of the earth  Our pity move or exercise our mirth  Or if in tittletattle toothpick way  Our rambling thoughts with easy freedom stray  A gainer still thy friend himself must find  His grief suspended and improv'd his mind  WHILST peaceful slumbers bless the homely bed  Where virtue selfapprov'd reclines her head  Whilst vice beneath imagin'd horrors mourns  And conscience plants the villains couch with thorns  Impatient of restraint the active mind  No more by servile prejudice confin'd  Leaps from her seat as wak'ned from a trance  And darts through Nature at a single glance  Then we our friends our foes ourselves survey  And see by NIGHT what fools we are by DAY  STRIPT of her gaudy plumes and vain disguise  See where Ambition mean and loathsome lies  Reflexion with relentless hand pulls down  The tyrant's bloody wreath and ravish'd crown  In vain he tells of battles bravely won  Of nations conquer'd and of Worlds undone  Triumphs like these but ill with Manhood suit  And sink the conqueror beneath the brute  But if in searching round the world we find  Some gen'rous youth the Friend of all mankind  Whose anger like the bolt of JOVE is sped  In terrors only at the guilty head  Whose mercies like Heav'n's dew refreshing fall  In gen'ral love and charity to all  Pleas'd we behold such worth on any throne  And doubly pleas'd we find it on our own  THROUGH a false medium things are shewn by day  Pomp wealth and titles judgment lead astray  How many from appearance borrow state  Whom NIGHT disdains to number with the Great  Must not we laugh to see you  lordling  proud  Snuff up vile incense from a fawning croud  Whilst in his beam surrounding clients play  Like insects in the sun's enliv'ning ray  Whilst JEHU like he drives at furious rate  And seems the only charioteer of state  Talking himself into a little God  And ruling empires with a single nod  Who would not think to hear him law dispense  That he had Int'rest and that they had sense  Injurious thought beneath NIGHT's honest shade  When pomp is buried and false colours fade  Plainly we see at that impartial hour  Them  dupes to pride and  him  the tool of pow'r  GOD help the man condemn'd by cruel fate  To court the seeming or the real great  Much sorrow shall he feel and suffer more  Than any slave who labours at the oar  By slavish methods must he learn to please  By smoothtongu'd flatt'ry that curst  courtdisease  Supple to ev'ry wayward mood strike sail  And shift with shifting humour's peevish gale  To Nature dead he must adopt vile art  And wear a smile with anguish in his heart  A sense of honour would destroy his schemes  And conscience ne'er must speak unless in dreams  When he hath tamely borne for many years  Cold looks forbidding frowns contemptuous sneers  When he at last expects good easy man  To reap the profits of his labour'd plan  Some cringing LACQUEY or rapacious WHORE  To favours of the great the surest door  Some CATAMITE or PIMP in credit grown  Who tempts another's wife or sells his own  Steps cross his hopes the promis'd boon denies  And for some MINION'S MINION claims the prize  FOE to restraint unpractis'd in deceir  Too resolute from Nature's active heat  To brook affronts and tamely pass them by  Too proud to flatter too sincere to lie  Too plain to please too honest to be great  Give me kind Heaven an humbler happier state  Far from the place where men with pride deceive  Where rascals promise and where fools believe  Far from the walk of folly vice and strife  Calm independent let me steal thro life  Nor one vain wish my steady thoughts beguile  To fear his lordship's frown or court his smile  Unfit for greatness I her snares defy  And look on riches with untainted eye  To others let the glitt'ring bawbles fall  Content shall place  us  far above them all  SPECTATORS only on this bustling stage  We see what vain designs mankind engage  Vice after vice with ardour they pursue  And one old folly brings forth twenty new  Perplex'd with trifles thro' the vale of life  Man strives 'gainst man without a cause for strife  Armies embattled meet and thousands bleed  For some vile spot which cannot fifty feed  Squirrels for nuts contend and wrong or right  For the world's empire kings ambitious fight  What odds  to us  'tis all the selfsame thing  A NUT a WORLD a SQUIRREL and a KING  BRITONS like Roman spirits fam'd of old  Are cast by Nature in a PATRIOT mould  No private joy no private grief they know  Their soul's engross'd by public weal or woe  Inglorious ease like ours they greatly scorn  Let care with nobler wreaths their brows adorn  Gladly they toil beneath the statesman's pains  Give them but credit for a statesman's brains  All would be deem'd e'en from the cradle fit  To rule in politics as well as wit  The grave the gay the fopling and the dunce  Start up God bless us statesmen all at once  HIS mighty charge of souls the priest forgets  The courtbred lord his promises and debts  Soldiers their same misers forget their pelf  The rake his mistress and the fop himself  Whilst thoughts of higher moment claim their care  And their wife heads the weight of kingdoms bear  FEMALES themselves the glorious ardour feel  And boast an equal or a greater zeal  From nymph to nymph the state infection flies  Swells in her breast and sparkles in her eyes  O'er whelm'd by politics lye malice pride  Envy and twenty other faults beside  No more their little flutt'ring hearts confess  A passion for applause or rage for dress  No more they pant for PUBLIC RAREESHOWS  Or lose one thought on monkeys or on beaux  Coquettes no more pursue the jilting plan  And lustful prudes forget to rail at man  The darling theme CAECILIA's self will chuse  Nor thinks of scandal whilst she talks of news  The CIT a COMMONCOUNCILMAN by place  Ten thousand mighty nothings in his face  By situation as by nature great  With nice precision parcels out the state  Proves and disproves affirms and then denies  Objects himself and to himself replies  Wielding aloft the Politician rod  Makes Pby turns a devil and a god  Maintains e'en to the very teeth of pow'r  The same thing right and wrong in half an hour  Now all is well now he suspects a plot  And plainly proves WHATEVER IS IS NOT  Fearfully wise he shakes his empty head  And deals out empires as he deals out thread  His useless scales are in a corner flung  And Europe's balance hangs upon his tongue  PEACE to such triflers be our happier plan  To pass thro' life as easy as we can  Who's in or out who moves this grand machine  Nor stirs my curiosity nor spleen  Secrets of state no more I wish to know  Than secret movements of a PUPPETSHEW  Let but the puppets move I've my desire  Unseen the hand which  guides  the MASTERWIRE  WHAT is't to us if taxes rise or fall  Thanks to our fortune  we  pay none at all  Let muckworms who in dirty acres deal  Lament those hardships which  we  cannot feel  His GRACE who smarts may bellow if he please  But must I bellow too who sit at ease  By custom safe the poet's numbers flow  Free as the light and air some years ago  No statesman e'er will find it worth his pains  To tax our labours and excise our brains  Burthens like these vile earthly buildings bear  No tribute's laid on  Castles  in the  Air  LET then the flames of war destructive reign  And ENGLAND's terrors awe  imperious  SPAIN  Let ev'ry  venal clan  and  neutral  tribe  Learn to receive conditions not prescribe  Let each newyear call loud for new supplies  And tax on tax with doubled burthen rise  Exempt  we  sit by no rude cares opprest  And having little are with little blest  All real ills in dark oblivion lye  And joys by fancy form'd their place supply  NIGHT's laughing hours unheeded slip away  Nor one dull thought foretells approach of DAY  THUS have we liv'd and whilst the fates afford  Plain Plenty to supply the frugal board  Whilst MIRTH with DECENCY his lovely bride  And Wine's gay GOD with TEMP'RANCE by his side  Their welcome visit pay whilst HEALTH attends  The narrow circle of our chosen Friends  Whilst frank GOODHUMOUR consecrates the treat  Andmakes society complete  Thus WILL we live tho' in our teeth are hurl'd  Those  Hackney Strumpets  PRUDENCE and the WORLD  PRUDENCE of old a sacred term imply'd  Virtue with godlike wisdom for her guide  But now in gen'ral use is known to mean  The stalkinghorse of vice and folly's screen  The sense perverted we retain the name  Hypocrisy and Prudence are the same  A TUTOR once more read in men than books  A kind of crafty knowledge in his looks  Demurely sly with high preferment blest  His fav'rite Pupil in these words addrest  WOULD'ST thou my son be wise and virtuous deem'd  By all mankind a prodigy esteem'd  Be this thy rule be what men  prudent  call  PRUDENCE almighty PRUDENCE gives thee all  Keep up appearances there lies the test  The world will give thee credit for the rest  Outward be fair however foul within  Sin if thou wilt but then in secret sin  This maxim's into common favour grown  Vice is no longer vice unless 'tis known  Virtue indeed may barefac'd take the field  But vice is virtue when 'tis well conceal'd  Should raging passions drive thee to a whore  Let PRUDENCE lead thee to a  postern  door  Stay out all night but take especial care  That PRUDENCE bring thee back to early prayer  As one with watching and with study faint  Reel in a drunkard and reel out a saint  WITH joy the youth this useful lesson heard  And in his mem'ry stor'd each precious word  Successfully pursued the plan and  now  "Room for my LORDVIRTUE stand by and bow"  And is this allis this the worldlings art  To mask but not amend a vicious heart  Shall lukewarm caution and demeanour grave  For wise and good stamp ev'ry supple knave  Shall wretches whom no real virtue warms  Gild fair their names and states with empty forms  Whilst VIRTUE seeks in vain the wish'dfor prize  Because disdaining ill she hates disguise  Because she frankly pours forth all her store  Seems  what she  is  and scorns to pass for more  Wellbe it solet vile dissemblers hold  Unenvy'd pow'r and boast their dearbought gold  Me  neither pow'r shall tempt nor thirst of pelf  To flatter others or deny myself  Might the whole world be plac'd within my span  I would not be  that  THING  that  PRUDENT MAN  WHAT cries Sir PLIANT would you then oppose  Yourself alone against an host of foes  Let not conceit and peevish lust to rail  Above all sense of interest prevail  Throw off for shame this petulance of wit  Be wise be modest and for  once  submit  Too hard the task 'gainst multitudes to fight  You  must be wrong the WORLD is in the right  WHAT is this WORLD a term which men have got  To signify not one in ten knows what  A term which with no more precision passes  To point out herds of  men  than herds of  asses  In common use no more it means we find  Than many fools in same opinions join'd  CAN numbers then change Nature's stated laws  Can numbers make the worse the better cause  Vice must be vice virtue be virtue still  Tho' thousands rail at good and practise ill  Wouldst thou defend the Gaul's destructive rage  Because vast nations on his part engage  Tho' to support the rebel CAESAR's cause  Tumultuous legions arm against the laws  Tho' Scandal would OUR PATRIOT's name impeach  And rails at virtues which she cannot reach  What honest man but would with joy submit  To bleed with CATO and retire with PITT  STEDFAST and true to virtue's sacred laws  Unmov'd by vulgar censure or applause  Let the WORLD talk my Friend that WORLD we know  Which calls us guilty cannot make us so  Unaw'd by numbers follow Nature's plan  Assert the rights or quit the name of man  Consider well weigh strictly right and wrong  Resolve not quick but once resolv'd be strong  In spite of Dullness and in spite of Wit  If to thyself thou canst thyself acquit  Rather stand up assur'd with conscious pride  Alone than err with millions on thy side  FINIS
