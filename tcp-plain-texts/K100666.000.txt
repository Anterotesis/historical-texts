 ACCOMMODATION A POETICAL EPISTLE  c  ACCOMMODATION A POETICAL EPISTLE TO JOHN ASHBY  Esq  BY  ROWLEY THOMAS  QUI MORES HOMINUM MULTORUM VIDIT  HOR  SHREWSBURY  Printed by J EDDOWES for the AUTHOR MDCCLXXV  ACCOMMODATION  c  CONDESCENSION  in the muse  Severest critics  will excuse  Condescension  in the man  Is the  skilful winning  plan  By condescension here I mean  Accommodation in the scene  Of life  Will  Ay  condescend  To view the trifler in the friend  That friend who ever has and will  Protect his character from ill  Give up lifeall  fancy's power  To cheer his every anxious hour  Then surely  Ay  can't refuse  The  whimseys  of a  flighty muse  A  bland goodnatur'd muse  that must  Protect the goodthe greatthe just  Protect the wiseprotect the brave  AllAllbut  coward fool  and  knave  And cowards fools and knaves shall be  The objects of  her charity  Then  Ay  surely will excuse  An  idle truant laughing muse  A muse that ever will incline  To favour  Ay  with a line  His  gentleness  can ne'er refuse  The fondlyoverweening muse  That oft  in person  will attend him  And  counsel quaint  will freely lend him  Then  Ay  never can refuse  The  gambols  of this  frolic  muse  Howsays  Sir critic  not to brand  With infamy the murdering hand  And every character that can  Sink to the  brute  from  reasoning man  Avaunt rash criticism  Learn ye  He serv'd his time to vile attorney  And  vile attorneys  ne'er can be  Fit subjects for  a lash from thee  We then  should  too much  condescend  WhatGive our satire for no end  NoLet him canter o'er the hill  Of  wild Parnassus with his quill  And stumble on without a note  From us who  think  and  write by  rote  The conscious muse in native charms  Laughs'till she burstsat such alarms  Dares  every critic to defiance  She never wishes  such alliance  Dares  every critic with a frown  To laud her  up  to blast her  down  With indignation now she burns  And gladly to that friend returns  Who gave her with a  gentle hand  And  feeling heart  each sweet command  What to  embrace  and what to  fly  During her term of slavery  Kindgentle spirityet e'en he  Can scarce escape severity  Whose  noble mind  and  swelling heart  Their virtues  cheerfully impart  TO MAN AT LARGE  without a dream  Of  self  's attractivedarling theme  That  lusciousdearengaging thing  Which sways alike  the clownthe king  At every placeat every hour  Gives  strange exemplars  of it's power  The  cheerful reader  too 'll excuse  The  queer digressions  of the muse  And give her credit for awhile  For every laughfor every smile  Which she engages to exert  Neither too timorousnor pert  As opportunity permits  And she can strike some lucky hits  Her first essayand all her own  Sir critic  fysuppress that frown  Solicits favor from  A FRIEND  And if she meet with his applause  Will lengthen out her  little cause  By daring  in some future plan  Analysis  of the human characterbegun by the author of this little performanceshowing  POPE's Essay on man  unintelligible  as a finishedphilosophical piece  but  largely subscribing  to the  inimitable beauties of it  as a  merely poetical one  To analyze that creature man  Whether in poetry or prose  Is insignificant to those  Who thinkwho act  from  nature's school  And never idly play the fool  As whilom  THOMAS  often did  Without his ever being chid  Except by suchas never knew  Skilful  to give the  finespun clew  To mild conversion's calm retreat  Where all the  musesgraces  meet  And every  ghost  and every  shade  Of  GODLIKE MAN  that  GOD  has made  Midst scenes of  wildest dissipation  lost  His  sensibility too often crost  Thro' the  kindliest warmth of blood  Deserting every  social good  This and that perverse vexation  Springing all from circulation  Of  boiling blood  thro' every vein  Quicktrembling to it's source again  The heart  whence every rapture flows  For every good which it bestows  On kindred manwithout a thought  Of being ask'd forbeing sought  Spite of  all the rage of fashion  Spite of  every wayward passion  Spite of nature's opposition  He means to make a strange transition  From  bad  to  goodoffhand  reclaim  Each  immoral  youthful aim  And stranger stillfor  quirking seats  Barter the  muse's green retreats  Holdcries  dame prudence  hold your hand  And listen to this sage command  Beware young man  with caution rove  O'er  legal bank  thro'  quibbling grove  Let  law  and  reasonPRUDENCE  join  Then then  you strike a good design  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Curse on  your tameyour frigid notions  And all such  quackcathartic potions  The  GOD OF NATURE  gave us passions  To  grace us with  on all occasions  And gave us  reason  to control  The  frantic sallies  of the soul  Past folliesNature  ought to bear  And think  him highly worth  her care  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  With all his faultsand all his folly  He's freed at length from  MELANCHOLY  And her attendant  APATHY  Dull  cynic apathy  whose boast  And blunted praise is always lost  By  seldom thinkingnever acting  And yet it ever  seems transacting  A mere machine  we use at will  And keep it  going onor still  As fancy leads  a  moping jade  A piece of clockwork  only made  For  keenest cuts  of  comic wit  Just when  my lady  's in the fit  To flourish o'er  wild nature  's page  And  stamp the wretch  of every age  The cruel critics still abuse  The  whimsicalmeandrous muse  Without one social feeling dare  To blast  my firstmy only care  And dully criticising say  The pillars when they artless lay  The superstructure must betray  Quickly the  castle  's undermin'd  And by a  trifling gale of wind  So fare the laurel and the bays  Of such a rhymester's  jingling lays  His  cantingpulinglukewarm  The  brawling brats  of  coldest climes  The  laurel  claim and  blooming bays  Without the least pretence to praise  Let gentlest breezes gently come  They shake his  highaspiring plume  Which trembling dropswithout a tear  From us who give him  every fear  And now  AERIAL GENIUS  now  Stoop to my museshe'll teach you how  To sweep the skilfulwinning bow  Bend  genius  bendaccept this  new  This grandaccommodating clew  Nobly defend the muse's claim  A  mirthful muse  's honest aim  And when dull apathists perceive  That you the  mystic muse  can believe  They'll  crawl it onin faith with you  And own themselves  highhonoured  too  Let but the lower ranks comply  You'll have the  muse's leave  to fly  And  soar it to  your native sky  First  let the  towering genius  dare  To make  high worth  his  constant care  Next  let the towering genius bend  To make each  honest hearthis friend  And never think it worth his part  To court  the head without the heart  We grant  that where they kindly meet  The union  forms  an higher treat  But a good heartthe deity will own  Farfar excelsthe merely laurel'd crown
