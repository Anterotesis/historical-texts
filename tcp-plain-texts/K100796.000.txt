 A WIFE IN THE RIGHT A COMEDY  BY MRS GRIFFITH  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR And sold by Mess E and C DILLY in the Poultry J ROBSON New Bondstreet and J WALTER at Charing Cross MDCCLXXII  PREFACE  THE Author of this Address is so perfectly sensible of how little consequence such writings are to the public that she would most willingly have declined troubling them on this occasion were she not impelled to it by two very strong motives a desire of vindicating herself from some of the charges brought against the following comedy from the interpolations thrown into one of the principal parts on the night of performance and the earnest wish of expressing the sincere gratitude she is sensible of to the public in general and to her friends in particular for the generous patronage they have shewn towards the publication of this little piece which with true humility and diffidence she now submits to their candor and indulgence  The author certainly had no reason to have apprehended the unlucky event of this comedy after the very favourable opinion which Mr Colman who is undoubtedly a competent judge of dramatic compositions had expressed of it  all along from the time he received it in July when he pronounced it  to bid fairer both for same and profit than any of her theatrical writings  to the day of its representation in March last on the morning of which he offered  to underwrite its success for half a crown  However she confesses that for some time before the exhibition she had sufficient cause to be alarmed on account of Mr Shuter who had a long and principal part in the comedy seldom attending the rehearsals and when he did being found to be extremely imperfect The author remonstrated upon this occasion and the manager indeed lamented the difficulty along with her but redressed it not  At length though late a day was appointed for the representation and on that morning Mr Shuter appeared at rehearsal pretty much in the same state as before and confessed himself incapable of performing his part that night Upon which the play was obliged to be further postponed and handbills were sent about at noon to advertise the town of the disappointment  This was a most unlucky circumstance for the author The curiosity of the public palls upon such delays and many of her friends who had waited in London to attend the performance went into the country concluding from the uncertainty of the performer joined  to the lateness of the season that the comedy could not be exhibited this year  A further and final day was afterwards determined on but the audience being out of humour at their former disappointment called Mr Shuter to account for it on his first appearance which threw him into such a confusion that he was not able to get the better of it throughout the whole performance  This untoward incident occasioned two very considerable disadvantages to the piece In the hurry of his spirits the actor not only forgot his part the deficiency of which he endeavoured to supply with his own dialect but also seemed to lose all idea of the character he was to perform and made the Governor appear in a light which the author never intended that of a mean ridiculous buffoon This unlucky failure in the performer was by some unfortunately imputed to the writer and appeared to be a sufficient reason for condemning the piece  Yet notwithstanding these almost insuperable disadvantages the play was suffered to proceed without any sort of reprehension except in the instance abovementioned and the Epilogue concluding with these lines  The author for your passport trembling stands  And hopes you'll grant it  under all your hands    received the fullest approbation from the audience without one single dissenting voice  Many of her friends immediately quitted the theatre in perfect assurance of the favourable event and came to wish her joy that the comedy had been sufficiently strong to struggle thro' such hazardous circumstances as before recited But the pleasure she received on this occasion was extremely transient for she was in a few minutes after informed that when the play was going to be given out for the next night some obscure persons in a corner of the gallery objected to it who were opposed by a considerable majority in all parts of the house but that after this kind of altercation had been continued for some minutes the council behind the curtain taking alarm at an apple being flung from the upper gallery and striking a branch of one of the chandeliers thought proper to obey the malicious who are ever the most active rather than the friendly part of the audience and withdrew the play  Whether this opposition arose from illnature or illtemper cannot be now determined tho' the latter cause is full sufficient to account for the effect as every one knows how dangerous a thing it must always be to suffer an audience to be out of humour at a first representation of any dramatic performance and on this account it would certainly have been prudent to have brought Mr Shuter before them in some of his more perfect characters between the night of the first and  second  disappointment in order to have palliated  the resentment of the public so as to have prevented any interruption to the performance on that account at least  By the advice of those friends who were present the author went that night to Mr Colman's house to confer with him upon this unexpected ebb of fortune He seemed to be much affected with it himself expressed a friendly concern at her disappointment and promised to consult with the rest of the proprietors upon what compensation or redress it might be reasonable to make her upon this occasion But the next morning he sent her a letter to acquaint her that  all her prospects from that quarter must be at an end for that she was to expect nothing farther from the theatre  The author happened to receive this severe sentence in the midst of a large circle of her friends who were then with her offering their services for that night to bring on the comedy again engaging to prove the positive part of the audience superior to the negative one upon that trial But this kind and wellintentioned offer she declined  She adhered to the same moderation also the next day when the same offer was again repeated and seconded by several persons before unknown to her but who seemed to consider hers as a common cause against oppression and declared a full confidence of carrying  the point against any opposition that might be attempted  The author does not deny that she felt resentment and was sensible of injustice all the while but she feared the consequence of a riot to the manager's property choosing to suffer an injury rather than to do one  All this temper and conduct was then calmly represented to the manager both by letter and the interposition of friends but no notice was taken of it The author confesses that she then made a claim of right to some compensation upon the late occasion but not till after it had been refused her as a matter of favour She founded her demand upon the usage which is the only law of theatres and quoted many precedents of the same kind some of them in circumstances too far more unfavourable to the client but neither  custom  nor  courtesy  it seems were to be allowed sufficient pleas in her most singular case  The author does not mean by any thing the situation of this affair has obliged her to say here to charge Mr Colman with the least design to her injury by any part of his conduct throughout She believes him to have been perfectly sincere in his professions and ingenuous in his purposes towards her and has seen him mortified and concerned to the last degree at the delays and disappointments she met with tho' he did not sufficiently exert his authority to prevent or remedy them  The author's friends upon finding that she would not avail herself in the way they had first recommended advised her to publish the comedy by subscription as well to vindicate her writing from the misrepresentation of the night of performance as to make herself some small amends for the considerable loss and mortification she had sustained from its failure  This kind proposal she has most gratefully accepted of and after repeating here her acknowledgments to the public and her friends for the liberal encouragement they have shewn her upon this and every occasion she takes this opportunity also of returning her thanks to the other performers in her comedy who took the pains to be perfect in their several parts and so well endeavoured to support the spirit of their respective characters amidst the hurry and confusion which so unhappily interrupted the course of the performance  She now begs leave to make an apology for having presumed to claim so much of the public attention on a subject relative merely to herself and with the sincerest gratitude has the honour to subscribe herself their much obliged and most obedient servant  THE AUTHOR  THE LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS  HER Grace the Dutchess of Ancaster  Countess of Andover  Right Hon Francis Andrews PTCD  James Agar  Esq  Hon Mrs Agar

the way  Among the Chronicles of modern fame  Who has not read of gentle Frances' name  Henry and Frances a fond tender pair  Whose soft epistles still amuse the fair  Some nights ago our couple all alone  A fireside  têteàtête  Darby and Joan  Frances said Henry give up writing men  And men alone should dare to wield the pen  Your sex of late all decency confounds  And breaks 'twixt us and them the modest bounds  Whether from passion love of pow'r or riches  Women we see all like to wear the breeches  At sea some madcaps enter volunteers  Some in the army list as grenadiers  Others write hist'ries stateintrigues unriddle  Ride the great horse and play upon the fiddle  Gently cries Frances truce with your reproaches  And mark which sex on t'other most encroaches  Soft silky coxcombs full of nice punctilio  All paste pomatum essence and pulvilio  With huge boaupots like boughpots daily go  Trick'd out like dolls to pace in Rottenrow  Thus flies the morning and the day to crown  To quinze and faro ev'ry fop sits down  Each coat so trim lest any speck fall on it  An apron guardseach forehead a strawbonnet  Nay lest rouleaus themselves should soil their ruffles  A muffatee each pretty master muffles  Women in vain to keep their place have striven  From ev'ry trade from each profession driven  Menmidwives swarm men mantuas make make stays  Dress hair dress meatlet women then write plays  While narrow prejudice deform'd the age  No actress play'd no female trod the stage  Some smooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd  And Kings sat waiting till the Queen was shav'd  But woman once brought forward on the scene  By man like Eve was lik'd as soon as seen  Let females then compose as well as play  And strive to please you in the noblest way  No sulky critic to the playhouse drawn  Whom modern comedy provokes to yawn  But marks of authors past the valu'd file  And owns Centlivre tempted him to smile  Why may not Ladies too in future plays  Strike  a Bold Stroke  and anxious for the bays  New  Busy Bodies  form new  Wonders  raise  Thus Frances spoke and bid her dear good night  And Henry own'd  his Wife was in the Right    Dramatis Personae  MEN  Lord SEATON

Gardner  SCENE London  A WIFE IN THE RIGHT  ACT I  SCENE A DRESSING ROOM  Lady  SEATON  and Mrs  MARKAM  Lady  SEATON  I TELL you Markam 'tis impossible I neither can nor will believe it What Charlotte Melville The companion of my youth the confidant of my heart could she form a connection so unworthy of herself I say again it must be impossible  Mark  To be sure Ma'am if you don't chuse to believe it I can't undertake to convince your Ladyship but I think the proofs are sufficiently strong on my side of the questionand if I had such a husband  Lady Sea  Learn to speak with more respect of Lord Seaton Markam  Mark  I beg pardon Ma'am but I was in a little sort of flurry to think of your Ladyship's being so ungratefully used by  Lady Sea  Stop I command you  Mark  Why Ma'am if your Ladyship won't hear what one has to say you can never expect to come at the truth surely  Lady Sea  That however I wish to learn therefore now tell me upon what circumstances you ground your suspicions  Mark  In the first place Ma'am did not Miss Melville elope as it were from this house without so much as letting  me  know where she was going to just a few days before you were married  Lady Sea  I can account for Charlotte's quitting me at that time but too well Markam  Mark  May be Ma'am you can account for her clandestine correspondence with my Lord also  Lady Sea  A clandestine correspondence with Lord Seaton What do you mean Markam  Mark  Mean I mean what I say Ma'am These very eyes saw her receive a letter from him  Lady Sea  Not from  my  LordFrom Lord Seaton Markam  Mark  Yes Ma'am from  your  Ladyship's LordLord Seaton  Lady Sea  Now you indeed amaze me  Mark  She was sitting in the very next room just there at the harpsichordand sweetly she does play to be sureI happened to be standing in this very spot settling the toilette Ma'amI love a little music dearly and I did stop to listen I own but without thinking any sort of harm  heaven knowsfor I then took her to be as innocent as the child unbornwhen  Lady Sea  So I still wish to think her But proceed  Mark  When as I was saying Ma'am in steps my Lord and with the very same sort of bow that he used to make to your Ladyshipfor you know he was courting at that timeMiss Melville said he I have long languishedyes  languished  was the word Ma'am for an opportunity of speaking to you upon a subject of the utmost importance to my happiness  Lady Sea  What subject  Mark  Why that indeed he did not directly say Ma'ambut really I don't think it so very difficult to guess But you shall hear Ma'amWhereabouts was I O where he  languished for an opportunity  but despairing to find one continued he I have taken the liberty of conveying my sentiments to you in writing So saying he laid a letter down upon the harpsichord and I made the best of my way out of this room for fear of being seen  Lady Sea  Grant all this to be true it does not prove her guilty  Mark  She had no need to blush then if she was innocent and I warrant your Ladyship that her face was as red as your Morro satin all the while my Lord was talking to her though it is naturally pure and pale you know at any other time I never was deceived in looks in my life and it was by Dolly Sly the housemaid's blushing that I found out the affair between her and George the groom last summer  Lady Sea  Drop your absurd comparisons and tell me Markam why you did not mention this  circumstance to me before I was married It might have served me then    Sighs    Mark  Why really Ma'am it would have been a very indiscreet thing in me and contrary to my own interest as well as your Ladyship's to have made mischief between my Lord and you before you were married It might have broken off the match perhaps and then every servant in the house would have been a loser as well as I Ma'am But when once the wedding should be over and all secured I resolved to watch her closely and if I saw any thing wrong to acquaint your Ladyship with it then when it could do no harm But they have been too cunning for us this trip For to be sure and certain she is now with my Lord at his house in the country  Lady Sea  Impossible I will not listen to this idle tale spun out of your own imagination without a single proof or even probable conclusion to support it Again I tell you that you are deceived and that Miss Melville's tenderness for me admits of no dispute  Mark  Her tenderness indeed A plague on all such tenderness I say  Lady Sea  You grow intemperate Markam Leave me and order Thomas to try at every stand in London to find out the chair that carried Miss Melville from this house  Mark  It is above a month ago since she left us and I mightily doubt whether Thomas will be able to recollect either the chairmen or their number at this distance  Lady Sea  Do as I direct without surmises  Mark  I'll send Thomas instantly Ma'am A pretty sort of wild goose chace truly  Aside    Exit  Lady Sea  This affair of the letter has tended but too much to convince me of my Lord's attachment to Charlottebut how is she to blame Did she take advantage of his passion for her or strive to supplant me in his heart O no I only am in faultMy illtimed coldness and reserve banished my friend and has deprived me of that more than sisterly affection which had ever subsisted between us I will not rest till I atone my conduct towards her for in spite of all that Markam says my heart by sympathy assures me of her innocence  Enter  MARKAM  Mark  My Lord Ma'am is just arrived I hope she'll be in a better humour now since he is returned  Aside    Lady Sea  And how does he look pray He has been absent I think these ten days  Mark  Look Ma'amWhy just as he used to do to be sureTen days Why what is that in a gentleman's life Ma'am Though truly your Ladyship has moped yourself pale again in that time with fretting about him and that plaguy Miss Melville  Lady Sea  Be silent I command you  Mark  What the duce makes her so cross of late one had as good be dumb if they are not allowed to speak  Aside    Lady Sea  And where is my Lord did he ask for me  Mark  He was following me up to wait on you Ma'am when Colonel Ramsay just arrived from abroad came into the house  Lady Sea  Colonel Ramsay what shall I say to him or how account for Charlotte's abrupt departure from my house  Mark  In truth Ma'am if I was you I'd throw all the blame on Miss Melville for I am sure that your Ladyship never used her ill in the least but was as civil and distant to her latterly as if she had been a duchess  Lady Sea  That was the worst of usage Markam but retire  Exit Markam  Enter Lord  SEATON  and Colonel  RAMSAY  Lady Sea  My dearest Lord  Advancing towards him  Lord Sea  My dear your most obedient  Bows gravely  Lady Sea  So cold and distant  Aside  Col  Though my congratulations come late I hope you will permit me to give you joy Madam and accept my best wishes for your Ladyship's happiness  Lady Sea  I am much obliged to you Colonel  Col  Pray Madam how does our fair friend After so long an absence may I not be permitted the pleasure of seeing Miss Melville  Lady Sea  I wish Sir both for your sake and hers that this was in my power but  Col  You alarm me Madam Where is Miss Melville  Lady Sea  Indeed Sir I know not but much wish I did for my own sake  Col  Surely Madam if she hath withdrawn herself from your protection she must have had some very extraordinary reasons for it  Lord Sea  Female friendships you know Charles are not among the perennials of life  Col  That is a mere commonplace reflection my Lord adapted only to the very triflers of the sex I have been acquainted with Miss Melville even from her infancy and never knew any person more intirely governed by sense prudence and proper affections  Lord Sea  Why Colonel you are entering into a serious defence of one whom I had not the least design of accusingThere are two ladies in the question you know and if either was to blame mine might  possibly  be the one in fault for I have not been able to discover any symptoms of infallibility in her Ladyship yet  Lady Sea  I pretend not to perfection my Lord but hope I am incapable of acting  Lord Sea  WrongDoubtless Madam But errors in judgment I suppose you'l admit to be the common lot of frail mortality  Lady Sea  I feel it severely in myself my Lord but cannot however avoid thinking it cruel to add to the distress I am already sensible of on Miss Melville's account  Lord Sea  Quite barbarous I confess Madam but husbands are savages it seems  Lady Sea  I neither said nor thought so my Lord but I have done  Lord Sea  Charles you'l dine with us today  Lady Sea  I join in the request Sir  Col  I shall attend your Ladyship  Lord Sea  Are there any letters for me Lady Seaton  Lady Sea  There are some my Lord shall I send them to you  Lord Sea  Yes if you please  Exit Lady Seaton  Col  May I presume my Lord upon the privilege of former friendship to speak my sentiments freely to you on the present occasion  Lord Sea  Why I think Charles that this same former friendship you hint at has rendered us so thoroughly acquainted with each other that I am not to expect any thing very new in the sentimental dialect I suppose at present But proceeda story may be good though 'tis an old one  Col  Why then my Lord I will frankly confess to you that I feel myself hurt at your behaviour to Lady Seaton just now  Lord Sea  Why that is pretty concise truly Colonel  Col  Remember my Lord the condition stipulated and then suffer me to tell you that there is something so unmanly in treating a woman ill especially one within our power that had I not been a witness to the  unpoliteness  I shall only say of your speech and manner toward Lady Seaton I could never have given credit to it  Lord Sea  Well well Charles I believe I might have behaved a little too harshly to her Ladyship upon this occasion but I own I was displeased at her seeming to cast the blame of her quitting the house upon the dear girl  Col  What girl my Lord You do not speak of Miss Melville sure  Lord Sea  Miss Melville O no nomy wife'twas her I meantdear foolish girl I say to quarrel with her friend  Col  So then my Lord you think that she did quarrel with her  Lord Sea  Why you can't suppose Colonel that there could possibly have been any other reason for Miss Melville's quitting Lady Seaton's house For my own part  Col  Nay my Lord I know not what to think but as there appears to be some sort of mystery in this affair I shall write to my sister Mrs Freeman this night between whom and Lady Seaton her affections were equally divided and with whom I hope she is at present Two years absence have left me scarce any other clue to trace her by But I shall never cease from the pursuit till I have recovered my lost treasure the lovely Charlotte  Lord Sea  Tho' you should find her Colonel she may possibly be lost to youTwo years constancy to an absent lover Charles How can you be so unconscionable to expect it  Col  I have not the least doubt of it my Lord nor shall I ever suspect my mistress of inconstancy or my friend of infidelity 'till I detect a failure in my own heart that may warrant theirs I neither love nor like lightly my Lord and of course do not lightly change  Lord Sea  I am glad to hear it Charles as I think I may now venture to introduce you this evening to a very fine woman who may possibly put your boasted constancy to the trial  Col  I wish both for Lady Seaton's sake and your own my Lord that your heart was as much proof against the allurements of profligate beauty as mine is But I have no leisure to make the experiment you mention at present as every moment of my time shall be devoted to my search after Miss Melville  Lord Sea  I rather fancy you doubt your own strength Colonel and would not afford me the triumph of discovering your weakness But 'tis worth the hazard believe me Charles  Col  Your Lordship must excuse me I have better purposes for my love and youth than to sacrifice them on Circe's altar  Lord Sea  You must certainly have struck out some very unmodern tour for yourself Charles to have brought home such an antique moral as this from your travels  Col  In this my Lord  The  GOVERNOR  behind the scenes    Gov  I tell you 'tis a much finer hand that ever you wrote even before you wore spectacles  Lord Sea  Not a word more on this subject CharlesHere comes the Governor my wife's uncle and for your entertainment I hope his umbra his secretary his valet de chambre or whatever else he pleases to call him is with him for I really think he is as great a curiosity as has ever been imported from the coast of Cor  mandel  Col  There must certainly be something extraordinary in a person who has contrived to unite in a single individual such a plurality of characters a  I should be glad to know something more of him  Lord Sea  He was originally a country schoolmaster whom the Governor carried with him to India and there used him as his private secretary but on his return to England having no further occasion for him in that capacity he has now degraded him to the state of his valet de chambre  while the mortified pride of poor  propria quae maribus  makes him affect to shew his learning upon all occasions to vindicate a superiority over his master  Enter the  GOVERNOR  in a loose Indian habit    Gov  I am glad your Lordship is come home again Here has been as much sighing and groaning as if you had gone an India voyage to take a tiltingbout with HeyderAllyDo you know that fellow Captain He's a stout buck I assure you  Col  No Sir I have only heard of his fame  Gov  I have some letters for you NephewI took them from Mrs Markam as she was bringing them hither about a quarter of an hour ago being impatient to know if your Lordship had any accounts from Madrass or BombayEarly Intelligence is of the last consequence to us poor piddlers in the StocksA man may make some thousands by it in a morning you know Captain  Col  I am utterly unacquainted with the business of the Alley Sir  Gov  Then I would not give a single rupee for your knowledge  Aside    Lord Sea  But where are my letters Governor  Gov  Safe enough I'll warrant you  Takes them out of his pocket  Look at that hand Nephew I'll be hang'd if any of your correspondents write such another Pray observe the  ll  's and the  rr  's of itCurious indeed  Lord Sea  I am only curious about the matter and not the manner of writing therefore pray Sir give me my letters  Gov  Well it may be so but I think now that a fine hand  looks at one of the letters  by the way if I guess right this is a female scrawl  Lord Sea  Suppose it should Governor you have no reason to be jealous as you have no wife living  Gov  No heaven be praisedpoor dear Bab's at peace But as you have one my Lord she may perhaps think she has a right to be jealous of your receiving billetdoux'sI used to have a sad time of it with her aunt upon that score I'll assure you We have had twenty squabbles aday sometimes  Lord Sea  'Tis from my charming widow Charles  Aside  Col  Your female correspondents must have been very numerous I presume Sir  Gov  Pretty well that way you may suppose Sir for before my last trip to India I was called Handsome Ned Anderson d'ye see Am I much altered think you  Col  I had not the pleasure of knowing you then Sir  Gov  This fellow knows nothing  Aside  But even then Sir I don't take upon me to say that I used to receive a score of loveletters every day I am no boaster Captain tho' I have been a favourite in my time let me tell you But what with her jealousy and other slight causes my poor dear wife and I used to contrive a wranglingbout for every hour in the day You can't imagine how much I missed her for the first two or three months after she died But timetime Captain gets the better of every thing  Col  Doubtless SirI fancy my Lord the hour of dressing draws nigh and as the Governor  seems to have a good deal to do in that way I think it but fair to allow him leisure for it  Lord Sea  We shall meet at four Colonel  Col  Certainly  Exit  Gov  DressWhat silly fops you Europeans areWhy can't a man sit down and eat his victuals in a comfortable easy habit instead of being cased up in a strait waistcoat like a madman d'ye see But my Lady my niece don't like it I presume  Lord Sea  Why really Governor tho' your apparel may be perfectly convenient to yourself I should think it rather too easy and familiar a garb for the company of ladies  Gov  Why there now what a pragmatical world do we live in your wife is my niece and yet I must suffer myself to be bound up to my good behaviour forsooth before I can be allowed to sit down to table with her more than if I was to dine with the Sultana of Persia  Lord Sea  We are all too much bound up in forms and fashions I confess Governor  Gov  Confound the fashion I say but if we must adopt the customs of other countries why not chuse the bestRather than ape your  Mounseers  and  Maccaroni's  why not follow the manners of the East where a man may sit at his ease in spite of the fashion  Lord Sea  I think we seem rather too much inclined to relish the eastern luxury and effeminacy already Sir  Gov  So much the better Nephew d'ye see and as soon as ever I get into parliament I will endeavour to have an act passed that curry and pellow shall be the common food and that there shan't be a button worn in all England  Enter  NICHOLAS  Nich  Your Excellency's commercial agent Mr Samuel Bull attends upon your leisure  Gov  I think that is as much as to say in plain English that Bull the broker is below and now I desire you to bid him walk up  Nich  I shall observe your Excellency's behest  Exit  Gov  Behest now what does that word mean my Lord but no matter the fellow is constantly puzzling me from morning to night with one  outlandish  phrase or another But here comes my little Bull that I can always understand and a very understanding man he is I can assure your Lordship  Lord Sea  I don't in the least doubt it Sir and shall therefore leave you to profit by his conversation  Exit  Gov  It is unlucky that honest Bull is not as clever at jobbing in boroughs as he is at the same work at Jonathan's for then I might save my money a little but a man can't have all perfections so I must e'en be content to purchase a seat on the best terms I can for what is wealth without honours to a person of my consequence d'ye see  Enter  BULL  Gov  Your servant my good friend How go things in the Alley today and how does the fair widow your niece I pray  Bull  Badvery bad  Gov  Badvery bad What has she got a fever  Bull  Devilish tumble  Gov  Not much hurt I hope  Bull  Lame very lameAll sellersno buyersTwelve per cent at leastBad news from Bombay  Gov  What is there an Indiaman arrived from thence  Bull  Private advice  Gov  Pshaw pshaw I don't mind that a dollarprivate advices are generally contrived for private purposes Tho' I was actually thinking of selling out before you came  Bull  Right very right  Gov  By your leave Mr Bull I should rather think it wrong very wrongWhat to lose twelve per cent man  Bull  May repenttwenty lower tomorrow  Gov  Well then I'll stay till they are got up againBut come tell me how does your fair niece Not very bad I hope  Bull  Much afflictedgreatly grieved  Gov  Why what's the matter with the dear girl Eh  Bull  Vexatious lawsuitComes on tomorrow  Gov  Well so much the better I think Every one would be glad to have a lawsuit over I fancy  Bull  Will certainly lose it Wants money to fee lawyers  Gov  Why now man you speak a little sense and I begin to understand youLet's see let's see Thirty gold rupees make about fifty pounds  that will do the thing handsomely I supposeThe girl shan't lose her cause for that article friend Bull  Bull  Won't do  Gov  Not do  Bull  Not less than five hundred sterling  Gov  Zounds and furies manWhat give five hundred pounds in a morning to lawyers I'd see the whole Temple in a blaze first d'ye see  Bull  Bid me not askSaid didn't love her well enough to lend itTho' able to pay less than a year out of jointure Six hundred ayear tells well on the change Governor  Gov  Not love her Why that's not the matter in hand Mr Bullbut five hundred is a large sum to sell out at loss you know as well as any manIf s  ock was high now I'd shew my affection d'ye see I wish this account from Bombay had not  Won't the lawyers wait a few days f  r their sees Stocks ebb and flow you know  Bu  l  Lawyers wait No delay in that branch of their practice Governor Must have it this very day  Gov  Twelve per cent Didn't you say twelve per cent  Bull  Twelve three eighths  Gov  'Twill be a great lossa considerable loss indeed Mr BullBut she has six hundred ayear you say  Bull  Six hundred per annum  Gov  Why that is one pretty thing and she is another so I give you leave to sell out the five hundred and carry it to her directly my honest Sam BullWe'll meet at Garraway's at eight  Bull  At Garraway's  Exit  Gov  This lie or truth for 'tis all one for that about Bombay has been extremely unlucky just at this timeThis Bull's a devilish honest fellow trulyI might have lost her but for him what a misfortune would that have been but I think the five hundred has secured her for the present and as soon as ever stocks get up again I'll release a few thousands purchase a seat in the house build another on the banks of the Thames marry the dear girl I doat upon sit in my nightcap and nightgown all day and then a fig for their dress and their fashions say I  Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  A table with a deed pen and ink  The  GOVERNOR  Mr  SQUEEZEM  and  NICHOLAS  discovered    GOVERNOR  AND so Mr Squeezem you are of opinion that the voters of Bartertown  Squeez  Of opinion Nay positively certain Sir you shall hear  reads  Upon the aforesaid conditions made stipulated and agreed upon by and between you the aforesaid Edward Anderson  Esq  and myself Bartholomew Squeezem who am the contracting party for the aforesaid freemen and burgesses of the aforesaid potwalloping true antient and loyal corporation of Bartertown that they will return you the aforesaid Edward Anderson to be their true and legal representative in parliament provided that you the said Edward Anderson do pay or cause to be paid into the hands of me the said Barthomew Squeezem on or before the day of election the full sum of five hundred pounds more than their former representative Sir William Wealthy is willing to give for the same  Gov  Softly softly good Mr Squeezem you have run yourself out of breath and taken mine away too with that last article What five hundred  more than Sir William may be willing to give Why he may bid three thousand for aught I know  Squeez  Not unlikely Sir though as yet he has offered but two But Sir William is a man of spirit and honour honour Sir cannot be bought too dear  Gov  Let me tell you Sir that honours that are bought are not very honourable  Nich  They are doubtless of more value when derived from personal worth  Squeez  Which is exactly the case in point Mr Nicholas for if his Excellency was not  worth  the aforesaid sum of three thousand five hundred pounds he would not have the honour conferred upon him of representing the antient and loyal corporation of BartertownErgol it is his worth or what he is worth which is the same thing that obtains him that honour  Nich  I deny your major and will prove your postulatum false  Gov  Why heyday do you think that I shall sit here to hear you disputing about worth and honour and such nonsense  Nich  Henceforth I am dumb  Gov  So much the better Now to the purpose Mr Squeezem Suppose then that this same gentlemanSir William Wealthy I think you call him  Squeez  Why that Sir is his real name and title His father was Sir John Wealthy his grandfather Sir Robert and his great grandfather who was the first Baronet of the family  Gov  Why what the plague man have I to do with his father or grandfather  Squeez  Nay Sir if you are in a passion about the matter there is no harm done I don't want  to persuade you to be a member of parliament against your inclination though I must needs own that I know no person who would make a better figure in the house than your Excellency Such a presence such a sweet toned voice I think I hear the people ask who is that honourable gentleman who spoke last Governor Anderson says one O he's a charming man and a true patriot says another  Gov  Why ay Mr Squeezem if I do come into the house I shall be a true patriot you may rely on itI'll get their streets paved and their lamps lighted for them I warrant me  Squeez  Why so I have already told them Sir Governor Anderson says I is as rich as forty Jews and no more values money than dirt he'd scorn to do a mean thing for filthy lucre but will let his cash fly amongst ye like dust my boys For you know Sir▪ they always think him the best patriot that spends most money and let little Squeezem alone for disposing of it  Gov  That is the very thing I would be at the laying out my money to the best advantage and therefore d'ye hear I would be glad to know supposing the worst should happen and that Sir William should outbid me how much I may be likely to lose by the disappointment  Squeez  That is a calculation intirely out of my way Sir But to cut the matter short Sir if you will please to sign this article and give me a bill on your ba  i  er for fifteen hundred or a couple of thousands I'll promise you to make it go as far as any man in England Sir  Gov  Why truly stocks are so confounded low at present that I can't bear the thoughts of selling  out to a disadvantage But you may pass your word to them Mr Squeezem  Squeez  Pass my word Governor Such coin will not pass current in that quarter I assure you Sterling cash and nothing else will do But if it is so very inconvenient to you to raise the money there are gentlemen enough ready to leap at the offer There has not been so cheap a borough to be sold these seven years nor won't be during this session I'll warrant you Why Sir every man of property in the kingdom wants to get into parliament now and you gentlemen Nabobs have raised the price of boroughs as well as of every other commodity throughout the nation  Gov  Well well since it must be so we'll see what's to be done I shall meet Bull presently and he shall carry you a thousand That will be two and I won't go a shilling farther remember Mr Squeezem  Squeez  I shall do my best Sir but two will never do the thing handsomely I fear  Gov  So it be done at all I care not a farthing for the handsomness of the matter d'ye see  Squeez  I can venture to say that neither Sir William his father or grandfather  Gov  What the plague are you going to draw down the Wealthy's upon us againCome along Nicholas get me my hat and my goldheaded bamboo I mean the best of them  Nich  I obey your Excellency  Exit  Squeez  I must set out with the sun tomorrow morning to fix our friends for I hear that Sir William went down this day with his coach full of money but no matter leave it to me to outpromise all that he can perform so that if your Excellency will be pleased but to sign this bond  you shall have a good account of the borough by the very next post  Gov  We have no bonds in India and a man is unworthy to live in any quarter of the globe whose word requires a countersecurityBull shall carry you the money tonight  Exit  Squeez  It would be a bad thing for us practitioners in the law if such customs were to obtain in Europe But 'tis our certain maxim that any man's money is as good as his bond whatever his word may be  Exit  Second Scene changes to Mrs FRANKLY's house  A dressingroom and toilette  Mrs  FRANKLY  and  LUCY  Lucy  Lord Madam how charmingly you look today Never sure was any thing so becoming as your dress and if we could but get your jewels now out of Mr Cheatall's hands I think you might really pass for a queen Madam  Mrs Frank  As to the jewels Lucy I fear I shall never see them more However give me the paste earrings for the present they'll pass on the Governor for his own brilliants  Lucy  I hope they may Madam for as they were a lovetoken from his Excellency you should not have parted with them at least till after you were married  Mrs Frank  Lovetoken nonsense Lucy for such a creature to think of love  Lucy  And yet Madam if it was not for that same nonsense you would not have had the earrings  and I wish Mr Bull and his nonsense had been far enough before he wheedled you out of them for I tell you again Madam that if the Governor should miss them we are all blown up at once  Mrs Frank  I know it Lucy but there was no resisting Mr Bull's importunities unless one had a heart as hard  Lucy  As his own Madam But I hope when you are married you'll cast him off intirely for I am sure if you don't his necessities will always keep you poor and then no body else will ever be a farthing the better for you  Mrs Frank  Ay Lucy there's the rub with youAnd so you would have me seriously think of becoming a kind and faithful spouse and devoting my whole affections to the love of my great grandfather for your advantage truly  Lucy  No really Madam I am not quite so unreasonable for I know it is as good to be out of the world as out of the fashion and since you must have a lover why there's my Lord Seaton that admires you so much and a fine gentleman he is and rich too into the bargain I'll warrant me  Mrs Frank  There you have touched the master string of all my misery I love him Lucy and know myself unworthy of his passion  Lucy  O for goodness sake dear Madam don't sigh and look so melancholyyou frighten me out of my wits I shall dream of the Magdalen as sure as a gun tonight You ought not to let such thoughts come into your head  Mrs Frank  A sincere passion makes us humble Lucy It is impossible that Lord Seaton should return my affection  Lucy  Now I can't see that for my life and if you would but look in the glass there I fancy you would soon be of another opinion yourself too If I was but half as handsome I know what I should think Why there's that Miss Melville now that our John says is such a beauty  Mrs Frank  Why indeed I must confess that I have some personal advantages over her But then how many others has she above me I almost hate her at the thought  A knocking at the door  Run Lucy see who it is My spirits take alarm at every motion  Lucy  And reason enough indeed Madam So many duns and nothing to satisfy them My patience is almost as much worn out as theirs and if it were not for my hopes of being well rewarded when she's married to the Governor I'd e'en leave her to answer them herself  Aside  Exit  Mrs Frank  Into what scenes of misery has my thoughtless vanity plunged me Could I have been but contented with the safe though humble state of life in which my fortune had placed me I should not now have been the wretch I am  Enter  LUCY  Lucy  Don't be frightened Madam it was no body but the postman with a letter to Miss Melville I left her reading it in the parlour She asked me if you were dressed and I fancy she is just coming up I wish Miss would not be so prying as to sit so much below stairs for there can't be a hand's turn done in the house without her knowing it  Mrs Frank  I wish she was fairly out of it with all my heart I beg Lucy that you will contrive  to keep every thing quiet here for a few days lest any untoward circumstance should marr all our projects  Lucy  Never fear we'll manage matters I warrant you till you are the Governor's Lady Madam and then you know  Exit Lucy  Mrs Frank  Yes I know that I shall be completely wretchedTo have nothing further to hope for without enjoyment in our present possessions is a miserable state surely  Enter Miss  MELVILLE  with a letter    So my dear you have just received a  billetdoux  I presume  Charl  No really Madam the contents of this letter have nothing either sweet or soft in them 'Tis from my aunt Lady Walton who declines receiving me under her protection from a ridiculous apprehension that her son Sir William now just coming of age might possibly take it into his head to fall in love with his cousen  Mrs Frank  Why I think that to be no unlikely surmise Miss Melville and I must suppose it to be with such an idea at least that the burying yourself alive in Northamptonshire could ever have come into your head  Charl  Indeed Mrs Frankly you are much mistakenI could never have thought of soliciting a favour with an intention of repaying it with ingratitude  Mrs Frank  Well then if that was not the case I think I have reason to congratulate you on being as it were compelled to follow your own inclinations by remaining still in this dear delightful city  Charl  London I confess to be a charming place Maria to those who may innocently indulge themselves in its gaieties but a young woman without fortune or friends  Mrs Frank  Friends what an antique expression But you were ever romantic my dear and began even at school I remember to speculate upon morals sentiment and such notions but believe me there is no such thing on earth as a friend except money child Youth and beauty are bills of exchange and therefore you may be a friend to yourself if you please my dear  Hums a tune  Charl  This is a strange wild way of talking Mrs Frankly  Mrs Frankly  Nothing but the way of the world and plain common sense child But bytheby Charlotte I think the story you told me about your quitting your  friend  as you affect to call her has something in it bordering nearly upon absurdity And then your concealing the names of the parties even from me my dear has somewhat in it so very childish mysterious and pretty  Charl  I have said too much of their respective situations ever to reveal their names We may make confidants in our own secrets but have no right over those of others nor can I be said to be absurd in sacrificing my own interest and convenience to the peace and happiness of a person whom notwithstanding your sad opinion of the world I truly believe to have been my friend  Mrs Frank  Your conduct I grant it was heroic Charlotte and might have made a notable figure in a romance some centuries ago but epic virtue my dear is by no means the  ton  of modern times The present world is not near so difficult as  it was formerly and the utmost that is required of feeble nature nowadays is barely to conceal the vices we have under the affectation of those virtues we are deficient in  Charl  Hypocrisy they say is the homage that vice pays to virtue but I consider it rather as an aggravation of iniquity  Mrs Frank  Nay prithee Miss Melville do not preach against prudence It is certainly a very necessary quality at least and one that I would as  a friend  most seriously recommend to your own practice But as I am really not yet old enough to set up for a Duenna we'll change the subject if you pleaseWhat think you of Ranelagh tonight  Charl  I must beg to be excused from appearing in public Mrs Frankly 'till my situation and circumstances in life shall be in some degree more ascertained  Mrs Frank  Why absolutely child you amaze me your fortune is small your relations seem to have cut you off then what measure is left you now but  to ascertain your situation and circumstances  as you say by the means of your personal advantages Had I staid moping and moralizing in a corner I should never have made the figure in life I do at present  Charl  Our spirit and talents are of quite different natures Maria  Mrs Frank  I must confess indeed that there is something rather more striking in my form and features than in yours but tastes differ you know my dear and as in pictures some like the busy others the still life so there may perhaps be certain virtuosos who might possibly give you the preference  Charl  Upon my word Mrs Frankly I shall never pretend to rival you There is but one man in the world I ever wished to please and he is to my misfortune far distant at present  Mrs Frank  Bravo Miss Charlotte And who is this dear man I pray you  Charl  There again you must excuse my silence Maria Two years of absence may have changed his sentiments and tho' mine for him can never vary the world is apt to think our being the first to receive and the last to retain a passion to be a I reach of that kind of prudence you have just now recommended to me You see I can profit by advice Maria  Enter a Servant  Ser  Mr Bull Madam is below and is come to wait on you  Mrs Frank  Desire my uncle to walk up  Exit servant  Believe me Miss Melville I have not the least curiosity about your swain unless it might be to assist you But I have rather more business of this sort of my own on my hands already than I know well how to manage But softly here comes my unclenot a word more on this subject for the present  Enter  BULL  with a large bag of money in his hand    Bull  I hope I am welcome Now my dear Maria  Starts at seeing Miss Melville  Servant niece  Puts up the money  Mrs Frank  How unguarded  Aside  Miss Melville my uncle and I have a little business  about money matters to transact together and I hope therefore that you'll excuse my requesting you to retire a while  Charl  I was just going to beg the favour of one of your servants to attend me a few doors off to inquire whether a friend of mine Mrs Freeman be come to town  Mrs Frank  O by all means go and inquire after your  friend  I wish she had been gone an hour ago  Aside  You'll come back to dinner I suppose  Charl  I shall attend you  Exit  Bull  Looking after her  Who is that charming girl Maria and how came you acquainted with her  Mrs Frank  We were bred at the same boardingschool together but had not seen one another these eight years till about a month ago I met her by chance at my milleners who happened to be her's also She was inquiring for lodgings for a short time that she purposed staying in London and I foolishly invited her to my house in hopes of an agreeable companion at home but I find her such a canting Methodist that I shall lay hold on the first fair pretence that offers of ridding myself of so stupid an incumbrance  Bull  She looks far from being stupid Maria and if I might advise I would not have you let the Governor see her I think I never saw more lively eyes in my life  Mrs Frank  And they have set your heart of tinder in a blaze I suppose  Bull  No Mariatho' if you had not been by I know not what might have been the case  Mrs Frank  Stuff this is nothing to the purpose at present But where is the money you shewed me just now  Bull  Here it is a round five hundred in cash and paper There never was any thing so lucky as my getting it from the Governor to see your lawyers Maria Ha ha haBut I hope it will keep me out of their talons at least for a little while longer till something better happens  Mrs Frank  You astonish me Mr Bull Why you do not mean to convert it to your own use surely  Bull  I must confess I really do thou most astonished fair  Mrs Frank  What while my jewels lie pledged for your necessities  Bull  And who was the cause of your getting those jewels Mrs Frankly Whose credit has hitherto supported you in affluence and grandeur Mrs Frankly And what has involved Samuel Bull in difficulties and ruin but the necessities of Mrs Frankly  Mrs Frank  Upbraiding cancels every obligationI shall let the Governor know how you have behaved both to him and me  Bull  Then you'll let him know that you are a fool Maria and choose to put back to sea in a storm when you were got within sight of the port Won't underwrite the vessel for a shilling  Mrs Frank  No 'tis you that mean to destroy my hopes of fortune and your own too by robbing me thus  Bull  Have a careinjure the credit of a man of businessheavy action will lie must assure you  Mrs Frank  What are you puting on your canting face and set phrases to me I will expose you to the world tho' I should be ruined with you  Bull  Weather hotpassion dangerousmay bring on a fever  Mrs Frank  Insulting monster  Bull  No monster Maria Wellbuilt tight little man as you'd see upon 'Change on a summer's dayWill bring the Governor in the eveningmust acknowledge the receipt of the five hundred  Mrs Frank  Then let me have it to release my earringsyou know if he misses them we are undone and you can have them again in a day or two if your occasions should require it  Bull  Some sense and reason in that must confess  Mrs Frank  Do you think i  is for the mere vanity of such toys that I  distress you  Bull  Here take the money then and release your jewelsBut remember Maria that if we still continue to act on the family compact we may both of us thrive But if you attempt to play me false your own ruin must be the consequence  Gives the money  Mrs Frank  Fear me not Mr Bull but I cannot stay to make professions now I am all impatience till I release the dear little sparklers  Goes to the side of the scene  Get me a chair directly How mean and dull these paste baubles appear at the very idea of brilliants  Looking in the glass  Bull  You don't seem to think them such  vain toys  as you did just now Maria  Mrs Frank  Don't you know that it is the very perfection of philosophy to seem to despise  what we doat on when it is out of our reach But to shew you that I can be indifferent even to finery I positively assure you that I will not wear them this whole daythere's resolution for you  Bull  A whole day amazing effort of philosophy truly  Enter a Servant  Ser  The chair is ready Madam  Bull  I'll hand you into it and direct the men  Exeunt  Enter Miss  MELVILLE  Char  How fortunate have I been in meeting with Mrs Freeman even in the very moment when I began so severely to be sensible of my indiscretion in having too lightly accepted of Mrs Frankly's invitation The freedom of those sentiments she expressed just now has both shocked and surprized me My happy inexperience did not suffer me to suspect that a few years commerce with the world could have produced so absolute a change in a heart that formerly appeared as innocent and artless as my own Nor could I have believed that the widow Frankly launched into the world at large might become a very different sort of character from what she first appeared in as my schoolfellow and friend  Enter  VARNISH  followed by  LUCY  Varn  Don't tell me Mrs Lucy I will have my money  Lucy  For goodness sake my dear sweet Mr Varnish have patience but for a few days longer  I give you my honour that my lady is to be married directly and then all her debts will be duly paid Miss Melville here then we are blown indeed  Aside    Varn  I tell you my dear sweet Mrs Lucy that I will not have patience for an hour longer and that I would not give a cast coachwheel for yours and your Lady's honour into the bargain Married quotha why that may be Mrs Lucy but matrimony nowadays is more apt to create new debts than to discharge old ones and therefore I am resolved not to stir out of this house Mrs Lucy 'till I get satisfaction for my demand  Lucy  Sure never was any thing so unlucky  Aside  Charl  Pray what is the matter Mrs Lucy  Lucy  Why Madam this honest gentleman a cheating rogue  Aside  is come to demand a trifling sum  Varn  A trifle do you call it Well then pay me my good hundred and thirty pounds and I shall thank you for the trifle I assure you  Lucy  Dear Mr Varnish what is a paltry hundred and thirty pounds to a man of your substance when you consider how many more hundreds you may get by my Lady Why she must have three new carriages at least for herself when she is married besides a most superb palanquin for his Excellency such as your Nabobs use and she has promised to buy me a timwhiskey for myself and I have ever found her as good as her word she is not one of your court promisers I assure you  Varn  I wish I could say so with all my heart but she has promised to pay me my  paltry sum  as  you call it any time these six months and her memory has failed her plaguily Mrs Lucy  Lucy  Lord man how can a woman think of any thing when she is going to be married but of Almack's Cornely's the Pantheon or the Coterie  Charl  I think Mrs Lucy that you had better acquaint your Lady with this gentleman's impatience at present as I left her uncle with her just now and he would most probably satisfy him  Lucy  Dear Madam he is gone and my Mistress out too but if he were with her a thousand times I dare not do so Mr Bull to be sure is a very rich man but a very penurious one and might perhaps disinherit his niece if he knew that she ventured to run a shilling in debt  Varn  Why it is not to him she is going to be married Eh Lucy He has debts enough of his own to pay I can tell you  Lucy  O dear no Mr Varnish she is to be married to a great rich Nabob worth six millions the least farthing  Varn  Why that's a good round sum truly if one could be certain of the matter'Tis worth trying however  Aside  Eh Mrs Lucy and may I depend on her dealing with me afterwards for I have been fobbed off in that way before now When the quality get so far in our debt that they don't choose to pay they often quit us and then do as much for some other of the trade  Lucy  But my Lady has too much honour to serve any one so believe me  Varn  Not overstocked with that commodity I dare say  Aside  Well Mrs Lucy to shew you now what a reasonable man I am I will take your  word for my debt 'till your Lady is married And then either the Nabob's purse or person shall be my security  Aside  But you are certain she will want three carriages  Lucy  Ay as sure as there is truth in my words Mr Varnish  Varn  Well then good Mrs Lucy we will not disturb this gentlewoman any further Your servant Madam  Lucy  Let me wait on you down stairs good Mr Varnish  Varn  You'd have the whisky green I suppose  Lucy  A bright peagreen certainly  Exeunt Varnish and Lucy  Charl  I am alarmed even to terror at my situation here Every thing I see or hear confirms my apprehensions and suspicions with regard to Mrs Frankly's conduct It seems an age till I quit her houseUnder the protection of my dear Mrs Freeman how safe and happy shall I feel myself The consciousness of one's own virtue becomes doubly pleasing from the concurring testimony of an amiable and worthy friend  Enter  LUCY  Lucy  Lord Madam I beg your pardon but that vile blundering coachmaker man has put it quite out of my head to tell you that just as you came into the door a servant in livery followed you and asked our John if you lived here and the fool only answered simply yes without inquiring his business or calling me to sift him But if he should come again I shall be able to give a good account of his errand I warrant me  Charl  I am obliged to you Mrs Lucy but would not have you give yourself the least trouble in the matter as I shall quit this house in the evening and know no person who can have any manner of business to enquire after me  Lucy  Dear Madam why my Lady will be so lonesome without you  Charl  I fancy not Mrs Lucy But pray is she visible at present for I am impatient to acquaint her with my good fortune in meeting with the friend I went in quest of  Lucy  I am sure she will rejoice at it But pray Madam where does your friend live I should be glad to know in case the servant should call again with a letter to you I'll lay my life on't you have made some new conquest Madam tho' the fellow was cunning enough to pretend that he belonged to some Lady when he asked the question  Charl  'Tis never worth a woman's while Lucy to trouble herself about any chance admirerif he be really one he will soon find out some method or other of declaring himself so Too much anxiety about such matters always renders us contemptible  Lucy  I find Madam that you don't chuse to trust me with your secrets  Charl  Indeed Lucy I have none Innocence disdains mystery Nor is there a single action of my life that I need wish to be concealed  Lucy  That's an extraordinary declaration truly in these days for a young Lady turned of eighteen And now if you please Madam I'll see if my Lady be come in and let her know that you desire to speak with her  Charl  I shall be obliged to you  Exit  Lucy  Unhappy Maria how sincerely do I pity her  situation yet let me hope that indiscretions rather than vice have misled her steps from the sole paths of happiness and peace But do they not alas in our sex almost equally involve their wretched victims in misery and lead them on to ruin Were it possible for me to awaken her to a sense of her danger I should then have most amply repaid her civilities to me by an act of the most real kindness and friendship  Exit  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE Lord SEATON's house  Lord  SEATON  and Colonel  RAMSAY  at table with bottles glasses  c  COLONEL  YOU must excuse me my Lord I don't choose to drink any more    Rising    Lord Sea  Why thou art such a sober fellow Charles that if I did not know you well I should imagine you had a design upon some rich Dowager and were to pass your evening at picquet with her  Rises  Col  Why even that my Lord though by no means my choice I should prefer to the unmanly practice of stupefying my senses and inflaming my blood with wine  Lord Sea  You'll certainly be a vast favourite with the Ladies Colonel  Col  Then I shall as certainly think myself a very happy man my Lord for I look upon the company of agreeable women to be the most charming society in the world  Lord Sea  'Ware poaching Charles keep out of my purlieus and the rest of the field lies open before you  Enter  WATERS  with a Card to the  COLONEL  Wat  From my Lady Sir  Lord Sea  I think I spoke just in time Colonel What answer from Mrs Frankly Waters  Wat  Her compliments and she will be glad to see your Lordship this evening  Lord Sea  Order the coach in half an hour  Col  My respects to her Ladyship and I shall obey her commands  Exit Waters  Lord Sea  And pray Colonel if it be no mystery what are her Ladyship's commands  Col  As she has not restrained me from communicating them you shall be informed my Lord  Gives him the card  Lord Sea  Lady Seaton's compliments to Colonel Ramsay and desires the honour of his company to supper this evening on a very particular occasion  What can this particular invitation mean There seems to be something odd in this business Colonel Perhaps her Ladyship designs to raise my jealousy I have heard of such arts put in practice upon lukewarm husbands heretofore  Col  She has gone one step towards it my Lord at least by raising your curiosity But where our affections are not much interested I should think it unnatural for any such passion to be moved  Lord Sea  You'll pardon me Colonel for though I am not romantically in love with my wife I could perhaps be as outrageously jealous of her honour on the least alarm as the most amorous coxcomb breathing But to do her justice her conduct through life has been so irreproachable that I dare say her sense and virtue will never suffer her to render me uneasy that way at least  Col  I should be better pleased at hearing you make your wife's encomium if it did not so strongly  reflect upon yourself my Lord How is it possible that you can allow her those merits which are to be the basis of your security and peace and yet withhold from her the just reward of them your tenderness and esteem  Lord Sea  Do not press me upon this subject Ramsay for even to you I cannot unfold the secret of my heart but will so far confess to you that I have acted and still continue to do so against the fullest conviction both of my honour and reason But perhaps if I could happen to discover a few failings in my wife's character her presence would be less uneasy to me for in short Charles we cannot love any one cordially who constantly reproaches us though ever so silently  Col  What a perverse fate is Lady Seaton doomed to whose very merits are imputed to her as faults but I hope for your own sake as well as hers that this delirium will soon have an end for no rational person can ever taste of happiness who is conscious of pursuing it by improper means  Lord Sea  Though I feel the full force of your argument Charles you must permit me to tell you  Col  What I know already my Lord that passion is often too strong for reason and while Mrs Frankly's charms retain their dominion over your heart you will continue still blind and insensible to those of Lady Seaton  Lord Sea  You are mistaken Colonel my heart is no way concerned in my attachment to Mrs Franklyfor though she is handsome lively and as far as I can judge has nothing of the prude about her she can only amuse but not infatuate and 'tis merely in hopes of triumphing over a more serious passion that I sometimes trifle away an hour or two with her  Col  This is an extraordinary declaration indeed my Lord and leaves me still more at a loss for the clue to your labyrinth  Enter  WATERS  Wat  The coach is ready my Lord  Lord Sea  Get me my hat and sword  Exit Waters  Will you accompany me Colonel or shall I set you down any where else  Col  No my Lord I shall return to my search after Miss Melville and shall then do myself the honour to obey Lady Seaton's summons to supper I hope we shall meet then  Lord Sea  I know not whether I should obtrude on your  tête à tête  or shall have resolution enough to quit mine with my little widow so soon But success attend your pursuit  Col  Au revoir  Exit  Lord Sea  I most sincerely wish that he may be able to discover Miss Melville's retreat which I have so much in vain attempted But then should she reveal the cause of her quitting this house will not Ramsay think I have acted unworthily But of what consequence are his thoughts to the secret upbraidings of my own Could I but recal a few short weeks I should be happy because I should be blameless But that indissoluble knot which has rendered an amiable woman as wretched as myself can never be untied Then hang reflection success to dissipation and now for a little flirt with my lively widow for the rest of the evening  Exit  SCENE Mrs FRANKLY's house  Enter Mrs  FRANKLY  and Miss  MELVILLE  You are upon the wing I find Miss Melville I shall be vastly dull without you But before you set out pray let me a little into your present scheme and first tell me about what age may your friend Mrs Freeman be Immensely rich extremely old I suppose and you mean kindly to assist in making her will  Char  How wildly you talk Maria Mrs Freeman is in the prime of life and likely I hope to live long She has been a widow about five years and though universally admired has chosen to pass the greatest part of that time at her seat in Somersetshire amidst her own and her late husband's friends and neighbours There I first had the happiness of her acquaintance and there is she idolized for her goodness  Mrs Frank  And so your hopeful scheme is to be as good as she till you both fall into a lethargy together Do you know Charlotte that there is nothing on earth so tiresome as your good sort of people They constantly set me a yawning and will at any time serve to procure me as sound a slumber as a dose of opium  Char  They have a very different effect on me Mrs Frankly they rather rouse my slumbering virtue Emulation is the strongest incentive to  Mrs Frank  O pray Miss Melville keep all this canting stuff for your good Mrs Freeman and do not stupify my senses with any more of your homiliesI am in an agony till she is out of the house  Aside  Char  I shall not trespass on your patience much longer Madam Mrs Freeman said she would send her chariot for me at six o'clock and I believe it is now near that hour  Mrs Frank  Looking at her watch  Six yes really Madam 'tis extremely six  Char  I think I hear the chariot stop and now give me leave to assure you Madam that I shall ever think myself much obliged to you for your kindness and hospitality  Mrs Frank  Nay prithee my dear spare your acknowledgments I most heartily wish you a good evening and a world of happiness with your  good  Mrs Freeman  Enter Lord  SEATON  Lord Sea  My dear Mrs Frankly  On seeing Miss Melville  Miss Melville here O Madam what an happiness is mine to have met with you  Mrs Frank  Why this is vastly pretty sure What can it mean  Lord Sea  Nay do not turn from me Miss Melville for be assured that I have suffered more on your account than words can express and that my utmost purpose will be accomplished in restoring you to the society of your friends again  Char  It is impossible my Lord  Mrs Frank  This is rather too much Miss Melville you should have made your appointments at your  good  Mrs Freeman's and not under my roof Madam  Lord Sea  Let me implore you on my knees to hear mefor Lady Seaton's for Ramsay's sake  Char  Pray rise my LordColonel Ramsay did you say Is he in England then  Enter Lady  SEATON  Lady Sea  Where is my friend my dearest Charlotte  Sees Lord Seaton at her feet  Can I believe my sight    Starts    It is it is too true    Sinks into a chair    Char  My dearest Lady Seaton hear me  Lady Sea  No Miss MelvilleNo you cannot clear yourself nor should I wish to hear you criminate my Lord  Lord Sea  I am astonishedWhat can have brought her hither    Aside    I shall not bend to your tribunal MadamYou are my wife but not my judge and I must tell you Madam that I shall not easily pardon your acting in a manner so unbecoming either of your own character or my rank in life  Char  Let me turn suppliant now to you my LordDo not distress my best my dearest friend Indeed Lady Seaton I am perfectly innocent notwithstanding these unlucky appearances  Mrs Frank  O yes a mighty innocent creature truly to make your assignations here with a married man and bring a scandal on my house Little did I think I had harboured such a serpent in my bosom I am sure her Ladyship is much to be pitied between ye and to let her see that I have no improper connections with such persons I desire my pretty innocent Miss that you will leave my house directly  Char  You need not fear any further intrusion from me Madam Suffer me but to speak a few words to Lady Seaton  Lord Sea  These are your doings Madam    To Lady Seaton    Char  Would I had died before I became the unhappy cause of this dissension But be assured my dearest Lady Seaton however this incident may have raised your suspicions a time will shortly come when you shall be convinced that I as well as you have been grossly injured  Exit  Mrs Frank  O yes vastly injured I dare say in being interruptedI think you had better go after your friend my Lord and see her safe to her new lodgings that you may not be at a loss to find her again Base inconstant man  Aside  Lord Sea  I shall not incumber your apartment longer Madam than just to see that Lady out of it for as she bears my name I do not chuse to have it joined with yours  Mrs Frank  Insolent to a degree beyond bearing    Aside    Lady Sea  I am extremely sorry Madam for the confusion I have occasioned in your house but be assured that I did not expect to have met with such a scene when I entered it I have been much deceived  Mrs Frank  Yes indeed Madam Miss Melville has deceived you most extremely  Lady Sea  I fear she has unhappily deceived herself even more than meBut I shall not trespass longer on your time and patience Madam and again beg your excuse for my intrusionI am ready my Lord to attend you  To Lord Seaton  Exit  Lord Sea  I follow you Madam    As he is going Mrs Frankly opposes him    Mrs Frankly  Pray my Lord let me speak a word to you  Lord Sea  You must pardon me Madam if after what has happened just now I should wish to shorten our conversation as much as possible  Mrs Frank  Nay then I am convinced that what I said in order to remove Lady Seaton's suspicions of myself and turn them on Miss Melville was but too true Cruel ungrateful man But yet you shall not go  Lord Sea  By your leave Madam this is no time for trifling    Breaks from her    Enter the  GOVERNOR  Gov  Hey dey What have we here Lord Seaton running away from a fair lady and she laying violent hands on his garments  Mrs Frank  O Sir I am glad you are come to my assistance that you may help me to detain this infatuated man for his wife's sake from flying after a vile creature that he followed here just now I am sure I would not for a thousand guineas that it happened in my house and I pity his poor Lady of all things  Lord Sea  This is a master stroke indeed Mrs Frankly    Aside    Gov  Why really if this be the case I do think his poor Lady is to be pitiedWhy man the honeymoon is hardly over yet and I declare that I was constant to my wife for near a year after we were marriedBut then I was in love mightily in love d'ye seeHowever I don't think that either you or I have any right to interfere in his Lordship's amours Mrs Frankly and a forcible detainer is contrary to lawBesides I have a small matter of business to confer with you upon myself at present  Lord Sea  Which I will by no means interrupt Governor and heartily wish you may settle it to your mutual satisfaction  Exit  Gov  I shall be home to supper my Lord I  have bespoke a couple of little plates to be dressed after our India fashion My Lady has ordered the rest I suppose I make bold to hope my dear little widow that you understand something of cookeryfor they absolutely know nothing of seasoning their meat in England I have some excellent receipts of poor Bab's by me  Mrs Frank  How could I be so weak a wretch as to imagine I could retain Lord Seaton's affections He is alas gone from me for ever    Aside    Gov  You seem mightily disturbed I think I wonder she does not say any thing of the five hundred pounds    Aside    No bad news I hope from your lawyers  Enter  BULL  Mrs Frank  Here comes another of my plagues    Aside    Gov  Your servant Mr Bull Now my little widow speak to Sammy therehe'll make your mind easy I believe He is certain of your success and tells me that the suit will be determined tomorrow  Bull  Trial put off till next term  Gov  Never the worse for that Master Bull Stocks may rise by that time perhaps You did not sell out  Bull  Before dinner  Gov  How unlucky But however it don't much signify as it happens as I shall want that and another five hundred for Squeezem this very night  Bull  Money disposed of to lawyers Did not know of the delay till it was expended Won't refund Must be  refreshed  again first day of term  Gov  Refreshed  I actually believe you invent words only to put me in a passion This refreshment has almost thrown me into a fever  Bull  Don't be obstinatespeak to him or we shall be undone Maria    Aside to Mrs Frankly    Mrs Frank  No matterI care not what becomes of you myself or all the world  Gov  Nay prithee don't take on so neither Though delays are dangerous to be sure as well as mortifying  Bull  Wants comfort mightily  Gov  And she shall have it Sammy eh But let's seeWhy the term don't sit till November nextThat's a plaguy long day to be sureI thought to have been married directlyand if one was certain that this same law suit d'ye see was quite a hollow thing  Bull  Quite hollow  Gov  Say you so Why then if my pretty widow pleases we'll be married tomorrow and dine at the London Tavern or the Crown and Anchor or wherever else she pleasesYou shall have your choice d'ye see  Mrs Frank  All places upon earth are equal now to mefor none can quiet my distracted mind    Half aside    Gov    To Bull    Why I don't rightly understand that nowDidn't she whisper something about distractions eh There's no madness in the family I hope  Bull  Madness No no noDistracted with joy on her weddingday that's allPretty compliment if rightly takenHas wit at her fingers endRecover yourself or we are ruined    Aside to Mrs Frankly    Gov  Why that is witty to be sure but it did  not strike me I own at first    To Mrs Frankly    Well but compose yourself d'ye see for too much joy may sometimes be hurtful  Mrs Frank  Mine will not be immoderate Sir I promise you  Gov  That's very discreetly said now I am impatient for tomorrow I'll go directly to bespeak the dinner and get the licence ready Come Mr Bull you shall go with me But won't your niece give me one kiss  Bull  May command it  Gov  D'ye tell me so by your leave then    Kisses her    Her breath smells like Otto of roses By the way you shall have a bottle of the best that ever was made in Persia tomorrow morning The Great Mogul has not as good But come along Master Bull I have many matters and money matters to talk to you about but those little twinklers put every thing out of my head I shall want a thousand pounds for the good of the nation this very night d'ye see I have promised to send it to Squeezem and Ned Anderson never yet broke his word and that's a bold expression for one of my age let me tell you I am not a man of words but of deeds my little widow and I hope you'll like me the better thereforeeh and so adieu  My pretty pretty Poll      Singing    Exeunt Governor and Bull  Mrs Frank  I am glad they are goneI could not conquer my confusion Detested be the hour I tried the art to wear a smile upon my cheek while rage and grief tear my distracted soul  Enter  LUCY  Lucy  Lord Madam what a sad bustle has been here this afternoon I am afraid we are all blown up with the Governor as I hear he was by at some part of it  Mrs Frank  Lucy I am undone for ever I have lost Lord Seaton's heart and all other misery is equal to me  Lucy  I wish you had no other misfortune to complain of Madam Hearts are soon won and soon lost It is not love but money that should take up your thoughts at present In short all your creditors are alarmed and you had much better think of the only way you have to quiet them by becoming the Governor's lawful wife immediately  Mrs Frank  I do not want your advice but your pity Lucy  Lucy  Pity Charity begins at home Madam and for that matter I think myself as much to be pitied as other people  Mrs Frank    Pausing    Get me a pen and ink I'll write to Lord Seaton directly  Lucy  If you have lost his heart a pen and ink will hardly bring it back again but they are on your table in the dressing room and if I might advise it would be for the present at least to drop a connection which by ruining you may injure my own interests    Carelessly    Mrs Frank  And pray Mrs Lucy how came your interests to be any way connected in this matter  Lucy  Why really Madam to tell you the truth I apprehend that if any unlucky circumstance  should break off your match with the Governor it would then be out of your power to reward my many long and faithful services  Mrs Frank  Insolent wretch needed there this addition to my misfortunes  Lucy  People who bring on their own misfortunes Madam  Mrs Frank  Are to be insulted by their servants it seemsBut I will no longer bear your insolence  Lucy  Nor I your distresses Madam  Mrs Frank  My affability has been mistaken I find or you had not dared to insult me thus But as for the extraordinary merits you boast of I shall think it not the least injustice to leave such virtues to their own reward Prepare your accounts instantly nor dare appear before me again but to give them in Ungrateful woman  Exit  Lucy  Prepare your accounts  Yes that's easily done I have them pretty well by heart already I'll give them in tomorrow morning to the Governor and leave you two to cast them up together at your next meeting  Ungrateful woman  too I am called 'Tis fine talking truly about gratitude and such stuff because one won't spend their whole life in poverty with herand that I foresee will be her fate at last In love with my Lord forsooth and every thing must be sacrificed to that girlish passion Why if the Governor should marry her tomorrow 'tis ten to one but she'd be in the heighth of the mode in a week in Doctor's Commons in a fortnight and a beggar before the honeymoon was over But I'll prevent that mischief at least by exposing her to his Excellency and if he is bent upon matrimony right or wrong  there are people who think me handsomer than my mistress and if he has but half as much sense as money he may possibly be of the same opinion too  Exit  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE Lord SEATON's house  Enter Colonel  RAMSAY  COLONEL  MY search has hitherto been vain but I have just now heard that my sister Freeman is expected soon in town and if female friendships are not as Lord Seaton says an empty name she will probably know something of my dear Charlotte's situation or abode My engagement here for this evening puts it out of my power to enquire about her tonight but to morrow early I shall call at her houseMrs Markam  Enter Mrs  MARKAM  Mark  You are welcome to England Sir but am sorry to acquaint you that my Lady happens to be so much indisposed at present that she must deny herself the pleasure of seeing you for this evening  Col  I am extremely sorry for your Lady's illness Mrs Markam This sudden attack alarms me for her  Mark  O by no means sudden Sir My Lady has been ill of the same disorder ever since she has been married I wonder for my part how she has been able to bear it so patiently but she is convinced at last and I hope she'll pluck up a  spirit now and not suffer herself to be imposed upon any longer  Col  I do not understand you She seemed to be in perfect health at dinner  Mark  Well Sir and if she was she has had enough in conscience to have made her sick since then She'll believe me another time I fancy I am not apt to be mistaken whatever she may be I am sure it is a scandalous thing for him that has such a charming Lady of his own and has not been married quite two months yetAnd that pretty demure Miss too that my Lady was so fond ofBut I never liked her for my part and always said that smooth water  Col  Prithee Mrs Markam explain yourself You alarm me extremely  Mark  I beg your honour's pardonI forgot that you were in love with Miss Melville formerly or to be sure I would not have said a word against her before you but then I was so enraged with my Lord for slighting his good Lady that I could not command myselfThough for certain it is no affair of mine after all and I must beg Sir that you would not mention any thing I have said for the world for my Lady would never forgive me if she knew that I spoke of it to any one  Col  I am on the rack  Aside  The only way then to insure my secrecy Mrs Markam is by making me a thorough confidant for as yet I do not comprehend what Miss Melville has to do with either your Lady's illness or your Lord's unkindness She quitted this house I have been informed before they were married and they have both assured me they have neither of them seen her since  Mark  Does my Lord say so  Col  He most certainly did  Mark  Why then great folks have a patent I suppose for as sure as I stand here my Lady detected his Lordship and Miss Melville together this very afternoonAnd was that their first tête à tête think you  Col  By heaven I cannot give credit to this storyI should still think it impossible though Lord Seaton and Miss Melville themselves were both to confess it  Mark  O Lord Sir I am frightened out of my witsIt mayn't be true as you say after all I could bite my tongue off for being so nimble I wish heartily I had been dumb  Col  If you have idly slandered Miss Melville you deserve to be so for life But I will have this matter explained immediatelyWhere is Lord Seaton  Mark  O dear good Colonel for heaven's sake don't be in a passionthere might be no harm done to be surehe was only kneeling at her feet when my Lady happened to come into the room  Col  Insidious base dissembler  Mark  Why to be sure he has a dissembling tongue and every one thought that he was in love with my Lady before he married her except herselfBut she it seems had her suspicions that he liked Miss better and that made my Lady so cold to her that she hardly opened her lips to her for a great while before she left the house    A rapping at the door    Here's my Lord a coming I fear  Col  I hope so  Mark  O dear merciful Colonel have compassion and don't betray me now Consider I am but a poor servant Sir and indeed Miss Melville was always very kind to me and if your honour  will but forgive me this once I promise never to speak another word against her while I have breath But I must run Sir  Exit  Col  And well you have rewarded her kindness But when persons of rank and education set an example of meanness and ingratitude we are not to expect to meet with their opposite virtues in an inferior class  Enter Lord  SEATON  Lord Sea  O Charles I am glad to meet you I have a perfect novel of extraordinary incidents to communicate to you  Col  And I am glad my Lord that we are met and that you are in such a communicative disposition as I have a question to ask you that must be answered  Lord Sea  Must Colonel  Col  Yes my Lord it must be resolvedWhere is Miss Melville  Lord Sea  That question Colonel neither must nor can be resolved by meI know not where she is  Col  Can it be possible you should be mean enough to attempt to screen an act of perfidy and baseness beneath the flimsy subterfuge of falsehood But 'twill not do my Lord we must not part till you inform me where Miss Melville is and from her lips which used to be the oracles of truth I will learn all the rest  Lord Sea  You really astonish me Sir with a language as little becoming you to use as for me to bear  Col  The man who has deserved such language ought to bear it Courage and falsehood never  dwelt together and when the mind is so far debased as to forge a tale to impose upon a friend all pretence to bravery is but a jesta madman's phrenzy or a coward's rage  Lord Sea  I can endure this insolence no longer This roof is your protection for the present Sir but quit it instantly and let us quickly meet where the vile term you have now used may light on him who most deserves it  Col  Unworthy as I think your Lordship's conduct I cannot yet refuse your appointmentTomorrow morning I shall call upon youtill then farewel my Lord  Exit  Lord Sea  You shall find me ready Sir How was it possible for him to know that I had seen Miss Melville When I came in the servant told me my wife was ill and had not seen the Colonel She could not therefore nay she would not tell himBut it matters not at present who informed him I never meant to injure him I did not know of his passion for Charlotte till after I was married and had I on his return acknowledged each circumstance that ever passed between us he could not have condemned me How weak and culpable is want of frankness This alone has involved me in all my difficulties  Enter  WATERS  with a letter    Wat  From Mrs Frankly my Lord  Exit  Lord Sea    Reads    Notwithstanding inhumanity unkind treatment of mefondness triumphedstill weak enoughPossibly hazard breaking offadvantageous matchA man I detestBut what is worldly interest c  Mary Frankly  Despicable yet unhappy woman The artful meanness of her conduct this evening has sunk her below my pity This marriage that she hints at is thrown out merely to draw me to her lureBut 'tis in vain for I shall never see or think of her again Indeed I have something more material to take up my thoughts at presentThis hasty conduct of Ramsay's distresses me extremelyBut 'tis first necessary that I should clear Miss Melville's conduct to my wifeThey must be mutual sufferers by the continuance of Lady Seaton's mistake and she at least deserves all my endeavours to restore her peace Though I cannot account for her following me to Mrs Frankly's this evening But grant it were a fault 'tis her first to me and mine I confess to have been manifold against herWho's there  Enter  WATERS  Ask Markam if her Lady be in her dressingroom and let her know that I desire to speak with her    Exit Waters    In what different points of view do the same objects present themselves at different times before us The seriousness of my present situation has removed the veil which the false notions and loose manners of the present world had spread over my thoughts and actions I see now the impropriety nay the inhumanity of my whole conduct to Lady Seaton and wish though perhaps too late that it may yet be in my power to make her every atonement  Enter Lady  SEATON  in confusion    You seem alarmed Madam but lay aside your fearsYou have nothing to apprehend  Lady Sea  The consciousness my Lord of having offended you though most inadvertently must certainly render me unhappy  Lord Sea  The extraordinary step you took this evening Madam appears to be but little consistent with the delicacy of the sentiment you now express  Lady Sea  If you will condescend to hear my motives for it my Lord you will not judge so hardly of me I then thought Miss Melville innocent  Lord Sea  And so by heaven she is  Lady Sea  My Lord  Lord Sea  Yes Madam I repeat it and though to support my assertion I shall be obliged to accuse myself yet will I do her merit the justice it deserves On my return from Italy at the same moment I beheld ye both  Lady Sea  Stop there my Lordtoo well alas I know who then won the preference in your affections  Lord Sea  Passion is involuntary Madam but I had hopes that reason which directed my addresses to you would have conquered that partiality  Lady Sea  Impossible my Lord I fear and blushing own that though I perceived your attachment to my rival I yet nourished in my breast the same to youBy vain selflove misled I fondly thought I might perhaps inspire the tenderness I feltMy weakness has been punished as it ought  Lord Sea  You judge yourself too severely Madam'Tis I alone am culpable  Lady Sea  We both deceived ourselves my Lord and both have been to blame  Lord Sea  I would not wish Madam to involve you in my errors and am sincerely sorry you should have suffered by themLet me now proceed  After some unsuccessful struggles with myself I at length determined to confess my prepossession for Miss Melville and break off the treaty with you I wrote to her accordingly on the subjectHer answer was consistent with that worth which dignifies her whole conduct She owned ingenuously that her heart had been preingaged but also generously assured me that were it perfectly free she could never have availed herself of my preference in her favour to your prejudice  Lady Sea  Generous charming girl how have I injured her  Lord Sea  I have reason to believe that she left this house in hopes her absence might efface my passion and suffer your beauty and merits Madam to produce the effect they must naturally have had upon a disengaged heart From that moment till this evening and that by accident merely I declare I never saw or heard from her and was at that instant only intreating her return to you again If therefore you have conceived one doubt to her dishonour banish it for ever from your mind  Lady Sea  I never had a doubt my Lord of Charlotte's worth nor was it jealousy but friendship that brought me to be a witness of that scene which first disturbed my confidence in herBut you have now restored it and if I knew where to direct my course I would this moment fly to intreat her pardon as I do yours for I have injured you beyond the hope of an atonement'Twas selfish vanity inspired the cruel wish of being yours without the power of paying back the happiness I received  Lord Sea  Nay Madam do not speak so humblyThe polite attentions which I paid you joined to your own personal charms and merits might  without vanity have made you think that you possessed my love whilst I false to your happiness as well as to my own knew but too well I had not then a heart to give  Lady Sea  In vain my Lord you kindly strive to set my mind at peace and reconcile me to an error that has been fatal to us both I fear  Lord Sea  I am too sensible how far I have wronged you to bear this generous contest but may I hope the frankness I have shewn in thus discovering to you the weakness of my conduct will at least assure you of my confidence and esteem  Lady Sea  I ask no more my Lord and shall ever study to deserve them  Lord Sea  The kindness and condescension of that speech Lady Seaton merits much more and has awaked my tendernessBut is that worthy your acceptance now  Lady Sea  The world were well exchanged for such a treasure  Lord Sea  Accept then thou most deserving of thy sex a heart more surely thine than if it had first been led to you by passion only for that is liable to change but kindness and worth like yours must naturally inspire unfading love  Lady Sea  My tears alone can speak my joy my gratitude  Lord Sea  Thus let me wipe away the precious drops and with them all remembrance of my past follies    Embraces her    Enter the  GOVERNOR  Gov  Why hey dey what wind blows now but no matter this at least is as it should be and  just so I hope little spousey and I will spend our time together I have a business of consequence to communicate to your LordshipI do all above board d'ye see and as I thought you were dull and alone I came up to discourse you a littleI am glad to see you recovered niece they told me you were sick and kept your chamber  Lady Sea  I am much better Sir and now may truly say that I am well and happy  Gov  And I am truly glad of both my dear niece  Lord Sea    To Lady Seaton    Can it be possible my dear that generous as your nature is a woman can sincerely pardon a preference once shewn to another  Lady Sea  The doubt's unkindbut ask yourself my Lord Can there be any thing in nature more pleasing to a generous mind than to have something to forgive  Gov  Why this is downright making love my Lord and renders me the more impatient to talk of my own affairs d'ye see  Lord Sea  Retire my dear and rest assured that all my future life shall be devoted to the continuance of our present happiness  Lady Sea  Your kind intentions have secured its permanence and made my bliss complete  Exit  Lord Sea    Lord Seaton looking after her    How little do we foresee the evils that await us the apprehensions of what that amiable woman may have yet to suffer on my account disturb me much  Gov  Why for that matter my Lord I am a little disturbed myself d'ye see or else I would not have troubled youYou must know then that I am going to be married out of hand directly and  my friend Bull who was to have given away the bride writes me word that he can't attend my weddingbut if your Lordship will be so good to supply his place d'ye see  Lord Sea  I heartily wish you joy Governor and will readily accept the office but pray who is our aunt to be  Gov  One that you have seen very lately my Lord but you don't know half her good qualities perhaps she is the modestest most reserved little rogueand a man at my time of life you know and in these times too has no business with a fine gay flaunting Lady d'ye see  Lord Sea  Not much truly Sir  Gov  No no Ned Anderson is no such simpleton I have chosen a sober discreet young creature very handsome withalthat will mind family matters and be proud of her husband's company d'ye seeCan't you guess now my Lord there are but few in these days that can answer such a description I fancy  Lord Sea  Very few I believe Governor and I happen to be wholly unacquainted with any of that small number  Gov  Why then not to puzzle you farther my Lord the first letter of her name is Frankly  Lord Sea  Frankly  Gov  Why yes my Lord the pretty widow at whose house we happened to meet this evening she was mightily concerned for my niece I assure you for she is very strict and was greatly out of sorts at your behaviour And by the way you ought to be a little more cautious in your conduct and not expose yourself by pursuing a girl into a strange house d'ye see  Lord Sea  I am much obliged to you for your advice Sir But pray will you give me leave to ask you by what means you became acquainted with this same paragon of virtue  Gov  Why my good friend honest Sam Bull the broker having in the course of our business together conceived a particular regard for me introduced me to his niece some time agoshe has a jointure of six hundred  per annum  and he was plaguily afraid that some young fop might run away with her and use her ill he therefore recommended me as one that would be a kind of a father to her d'ye see  Lord Sea  Yes that I do see very plainly indeedBut pray is your good friend Mr Bull a broker for marriages as well as stocks Sir  Gov  No no my Lord he made no matter of business of it in the least for tho' he understands making a bargain as well as any man in the Alley he never once talked of a settlementall all is left to my own honourbut he knows his man that's pretty plain I think  Lord Sea  Very apparent truly  Gov  Do you think your Lordship can be ready to attend upon us to church by nine tomorrow morning  Lord Sea  Tomorrow Governor  Gov  Yes tomorrow is to be the happy day nephew  Lord Sea  As circumstances are drawing so near a conclusion Sir I will be free enough to tell you that you must not think of Mrs Frankly for a wife  Gov  Why that is frank and free enough to be sure my Lord but I must have some better reason than a mere  ipse dixit  as Nicholas calls it I  have always been a man of honour to the ladies my Lord  Lord Sea  I approve your chivalry Governor but with this reserve that you are sure your Ladies be also Ladies of honour on their part lest your knighterrantry should be dishonoured by your galantry and as it is happily not yet too late I may venture to tell you that your present Dulcinea is totally devoid of such a character  Gov  Not too late Ay truly but it is tho' for I have not even so much as an acknowledgment under her hand for five hundred pounds I lent her this very morning to fee her lawyers and I gave her a pair of earrings not a month ago that cost me five hundred pounds more But if she has no honour 'tis well she has some land at least Bull assures me that her jointure is a good six hundred  per annum    Lord Sea  What upon his estate Governor  Gov  I never heard he had one  Lord Sea  Nor I either I promise you and I rather doubt his having a foot of ground to stand upon in the Alley much longer  Gov  Don't say so my Lord you'll break my heart If Bull has waddled out a lame duck I may be an undone man for aught I see  Lord Sea  Matters may not be so bad as you apprehend but at any rate I think you have reason to rejoice at having escaped being Mrs Frankly's dupe at least  Gov  Rejoice at what that I have been deceived and disappointed in the woman I had set my heart upon when it is too late in life to think of mending myself elsewhere But I'll have my money and my jewels from her if they are to be had d'ye see before we part  Lord Sea  You'll find it rather a difficult matter I fancy to recover your property out of such hands but I wish you success and a good night with all my heart Governor  Exit  Gov  A good night fine talking truly after you have broke my rest I don't believe I shall be able to get a wink of sleep this month to come I think I am even more disturbed now than when my poor Bab died and I remember that I lay awake that night almost three hours tho' I had not lost a farthing neither  Enter a Servant  Pomp  A young Lady desires to see you Sir  Gov  What a young Lady did you say  Pomp  Here she is herself Sir  Exit  Enter  LUCY  Gov  So Mrs Lucy what does your mistress want another five hundred to refresh her lawyers tomorrow and has sent you to wheedle me out of it Eh  Lucy  No really Sir I am not the person you take me for I would scorn to join in imposing on so worthy a gentleman as your Excellency  Gov  Worthy me no worthies Mrs Abigail it won't do I can tell youshe has mistaken her man d'ye seeI am not so easily imposed upon as she may imagine  Lucy  I am sure Sir it has broke my heart to see how you have been cheated and deceived both by Mr Bull and Mrs Frankly  Gov  You acknowledge it then But I'll shew them the difference immediately and Bull may look  out for some fitter dupe to repair the honour and fortune of his family by marrying his niece  Lucy  His niece why that indeed sounds well Sir  Gov  Why is not Bull her uncle girl  Lucy  No more related to her Sir than you are The very jewels you gave her Sir are gone past redemption Sold Sir to supply  her uncle  's necessities and will never more be heard of believe me  Gov  I am struck dumb with amazement But if Bull be not her uncle why should she bestow him her jewels d'ye see  Lucy  Lord Sir there may be closer connections than relations I suppose in the world  Gov  I shall be petrified Why he is not her galant sure is he  Lucy  I scorn to speak scandal Sir but if he be he is not her only one I can assure you for Lord Seaton is anotherTho' the passion happens unluckily to be all on the wrong side there I can answer for it  Gov  My hair stands an end at her wickedness As for you girl there take my purse as a reward for your honesty d'ye seebut never let me see you or any thing that belongs to your mistress more  Lucy  So then the best part of my scheme is disappointed I findI don't believe that he has even looked at me  Aside  I thank your Excellency and wish you a good night Sir  Gov  Goodbye to ye Goodbye to ye Get you out Get you out  Pushing her off  In love with Lord Seaton O the devil the devil what now in nature can make people such rogues one  hears every day here of such pranks as would taint the very air of India and breed a pestilence there I'll go back I'll go back again in the first ship that sails and spend the remainder of my life among men whose words are bonds and where the ties of honour require no laws to bind themBut first I'll go maul my happyI'll break her night's rest for her and her heart too if I can The intriguing gipsey  Exit  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  The  GOVERNOR  and  NICHOLAS  GOVERNOR  I HAVE had a devilish bad night of it If I had vented my rage I might have got some sleep perhapsbut she was in bed and would not see me forsoothPlaguy modest to be sure But I'll make bold to break her morning slumbers I'll rouse her that I will Get me my breakfast quicklyThere's no good in fasting d'ye see Dispatch I say or I shall go without itMy rage will burst me  Nich  I grieve to see your Excellency so much inflated with cholerbut I obey  Exit  Enter  SQUEEZEM  Gov  Why how now Mr Squeezem  Squeez  O Sir you have made a fine hand of your affairs with your boasted punctuality  We have no bonds in India  forsooth Commend me to the persons who are not ashamed to set their names to a piece of stamped paper They are the men to do business with  Gov  Why what can be the meaning of all this Did not Bull carry you the money last night  And were you not to set out with the sun this morning  Squeez  No really Sir Mr Bull did not bring me a farthing but I believe he has carried that and himself off together by the light of the moon for he was not to be found at his own house at daybreak when I called there and I fancy that neither sun or moon will ever see him in England again  Gov  So then 'tis pretty plain that I have been completely gulled jilted bulled and beared by a professing scoundrel and a pretty face  Squeez  What signifies all this to your seat in the house Honours Sir don't spring up like mushrooms in a nightThey are not to be had when where and how you please  Gov  No Sir nothing is to be had as I please All's lostall's goneI see itI know itI'm an object of pity Mr Squeezem So if you'l please to refund me the thousand I advanced to you  Squeez  Why surely Sir you are not in earnest Refund quotha Why Sir it was all gone swallowed eaten and drank up in one day Electioneering is your only true  sinking fund  Governor Potwallopers refund  Enter  NICHOLAS  Nich  Sir your Excellency's meal is prepared within  Gov  Go eat it thenI have no appetite left Potwalloppers a thousand pounds potwalloped in a day impossible I'll cram them with turtle 'till they burst d'ye see and defy them to do it  Nich  It is reported that Anthony and Cleopatra expended at one supper  Gov  Choke them with their supper impertinentI shall run mad with vexation What a thousand pounds in a day and not to have either my money or myself returned after all  Squeez  Lord Sir how impatiently you talk Why many and many an honest gentleman has spent ten thousand in the same way and had no more for his money than you have  Gov  Get out of my sight I advise you while I can yet command my temper A thousand pounds at a meal  Squeez  As you seem a little indisposed at present Sir I shall take your advice and retire but if any other snug convenient seat should offer in futuro Sir you may freely command the services of your most obedient Bartholomew Squeezem  Exit  Gov  You and your disservices may go to the vengeance together I have got enough of electioning and of courting too for life I think I'll see Mrs Frankly this instant and have justice on that villain Bull if 'tis to be had in the land Was there ever so unfortunate a man as I am disappointed in every thingplundered by every body What a pack of troubles have I brought upon myself without designing the least manner of mischief to any one alive  Exit  Mrs  FRANKLY  's House    Mrs  FRANKLY  alone    Bull's absconding and Lucy's deserting me in so critical a situation have happened most unluckily  What excuse can I make for Bull's absence to the Governor He was here late last night and raving at being refused admittance▪ Fear of detection what a curse art thou O could the young and artless mind but know the agonies that dwell with guilt it would prefer the humblest lot with peace to all that splendid vice can e'er bestowBut what have I to do with such reflections now No reply yet from Seatonhis cold unkindness stabs me to the heartMy dear Governor  Enter the  GOVERNOR  in a passion    Gov  Thou worse than a vulture or a kite thou cruellest and most ungrateful of women I know not where to begin nor in what language to speak of you  Mrs Frank  What can this mean Lucy has betrayed me I fear  Aside    Gov  I am thoroughly acquainted with your arts I know all your history at full length d'ye see  Mrs Frank  I hope it has entertained you Sir for you seem to be much engaged with it  Gov  Don't offer to interrupt meLet me speak I say That villain Bull that fellow that passed for your uncle is no more related to you than the Great Mogul He is your galant it seems and you meant to marry me merely to make his fortune  Mrs Frank  Mr Bull of all creatures my galant This is too ridiculous Sir  Gov  'Tis true for all that as honest Lucy has assured meand the very jewels I gave you  nay perhaps the money I advanced to see your lawyers ungenerous woman have been all sacrificed to him  Mrs Frank  Lucy and so honest Mrs Lucy is your informer Sir I give you joy of your authority  Gov  Don't answer me I say thou harpyI have not brought half my charges against you yet  Mrs Frank  I shall not attempt to answer you indeed Sir as you really appear to be quite out of your reason at present and there is no arguing with a madman  Gov  If I am mad 'tis you that have made me sobut your insolence shall not defend you I will expose you and  your good uncle Bull  to the whole world I won't confine myself to one quarter of itall India shall know how you have used me Where are the earrings I gave you Where are my jewels I say shew them to me this instant I insist upon seeing them at least  Mrs Frank  How is that possible pray if I have already given them to Mr BullDelirious  Gov  Her assurance amazes meI thought she would have fallen at my feet and implored my pardon  Mrs Frank  No really Sirinjured innocence has a right to resent  Gov  Injured innocencethat word has almost choked meThis is too muchThen Madam  Injured Innocence  I have accused you wrongfully it seems  Mrs Frank  So you may possibly find Sir when perhaps it may be too late to repent of it  Gov  And why the plague don't you justify yourself then  Mrs Frank  So I would Sir if you were in a condition to hear reason  Gov  Well wellspeakspeak freelyI am perfectly coolquite calm Madam  Mrs Frank  Hear me then All this rage of yours proceeds from Lucy's having trumped up a false story  Gov  A false story Hell and the furies then prove it so Madam  Mrs Frank  Don't swear Sirremember you are  perfectly coolquite calm  you know  Gov  Well well I am so I had forgotGo on Madam now without interruption  Mrs Frank  Then first Sir give me leave to ask you if you are acquainted with the reason of Lucy's quitting my service  Gov  Yes Madam because she could not bear to be a witness of your imposing on me  Mrs Frank  Just the reverse SirI turned her out of my house last night for abusing you ungenerous as you are  Gov  Abusing me Why what could the minx find to say against me  Mrs Frank  How can you think said she of burying your youth beauty and fortune in the arms of your grandfather when there are so many  Gov  Grandfather confound the jadeLet me hear no more of her impertinence but come to the point Madam Where is  your uncle  and where are my diamonds d'ye see  Mrs Frank  Mr Bull Sir is gone into Wiltshire to bring up a witness to prove my dear Mr Frankly's last willand as to the diamonds Sir  Lucy you say has given you a full account of them  Gov  Yes yes and a receipt in full too Madamyour pretended uncle has carried them into Wiltshire to bribe your evidence I suppose  Mrs Frank  Mr Bull has them then mighty well Sir And if I was to produce them now what would you say then Sir  Gov  Say why really in such a case Madam I should sayhang me if I know what I should saybut 'tis absolutely impossible  Mrs Frank  Then not to satisfy but to shock you look there  opening a casket He starts    Now take them back again Sir for as I prized them more as a token than a gift they have lost their value with your unkindness  Weeps  Gov  I am confounded I am dead the very jewels I gave her that's certain That vile jade Lucy I see you are innocent Madam and must implore your pardon for having doubted it  Mrs Frank  You ought not to have doubted it Sir nor have ventured to insult a woman of honour upon the testimony of a wretch whom common sense might have informed you I should not have discarded had it been in her power to have hurt me  Gov  Why to be sure I might have thought of that Madam but you can't conceive what a pack of plausible lies she told meShe said you were in love too with Lord Seaton who despised you nay his Lordship spoke to your disadvantage himself also and first cautioned me against marrying you  Mrs Frank  But surely now any person of common sense Sir would have considered his endeavour to prevent it as a proof rather of love  than of hateI soon perceived he had gained Lucy over to his interest which was the chief reason of my discharging her in revenge for which she invented all those abominable stories and you were weak enough to believe them  Gov  I have been weak enough to be sure but you shall find now that I am perfectly satisfied  Mrs Frank  You allow then that you have been in the wrong Sir  Gov  Exceedingly  Mrs Frank  And that you have been duped by a woman  Gov  ShamefullyI see it nowI feel it Yes yes I have been duped indeed with a vengeance  Mrs Frank  And you really do repent of your credulity  Gov  Repent shall hang myself if you do not forgive me  Mrs Frank  Well well then I do forgive you Sir  Gov  And I ask your pardon again and again So now let us kiss and friendskiss and friends for life d'ye see I shall think every minute an age 'till we are onewe'll be married this very day Let's lose no time d'ye see I'll step home and bring Nicholas directly to give you away and do you run in and prepare so that there may be no waiting when we call on you  Mrs Frank  You trespass on my fondness which pleads your cause so strongly for had you less love you would have had less jealousy and the excess of one should ever atone for the vio  ce of the other And so I shall be ready to attend you Sir  Exit  Gov  Why that's very goodnatured and very true too Yes indeed I do love her monstrously or I should not have been so jealous But for all this I shall discourse my Lord Seaton a little before I am married for I neither can nor will be satisfied till I have made him recant his calumny  Exit  SCENE Mrs FREEMAN's House  Enter Miss  MELVILLE  Char  The hurry and agitation I passed thro' yesterday evening have discomposed my spirits so much that I find it impossible to rest Mrs Freeman is not yet up so that I have sufficient leisure to reflect on the extraordinary adventures of yesterday which I confess appear to me now more like a vision than a fact I am impatient till all this mistery is explained that I may have an opportunity of clearing my conduct to my amiable friend If the weight only of an imputed crime be so hard to bear what a burden must real guilt be Lord Seaton said something I think of Colonel Ramsay I dare not flatter my hopes about his arrival as Mrs Freeman knows nothing of it yet But see beyond a doubt my wishes are accomplished  Enter Colonel  RAMSAY  You are welcome to England Sir  Col  I have been so long absent Madam that I own myself rather surprized at your recollection of a person whom I hoped for your own sake  you had totally forgotten and you must pardon me if I also add that my wonder is a good deal increased by seeing you at present in Mrs Freeman's house  Char  What can this mean Surely 'tis you Sir who have forgotten both yourself and me or after two tedious years of absence it were not possible we should meet thus  Col  I fancy Madam that the absence of an injured lover does not appear tedious to those who enjoy the presence of a favoured one Lord Seaton Madam has sufficiently consoled you for my loss  Char  Lord Seaton  Col  You seem surprized but I am too well informed of your connection However Madam I did not mean to upbraid or intrude upon you now I came here only to see my sister and have but a short time to spare to her from a very particular and pressing engagement  Char  Be your engagements what they may Sir I have a right to expect you should explain the meaning of your present conduct towards me as far at least as it respects my character  Col  You speak Madam as if you thought you still retained the power you once had over me but you have forfeited it and I am no longer now the dupe of my own weakness or of your deceit  Char  O Ramsay how have I deserved this treatment  Col  I cannot bear her tears  Aside  I wish not Madam to offend or wound youyou are mistress of your own actions and all I shall further say upon this subject is that had your new engagement  been more for your own honour your perfidy might have been more pardonable to one who respected your character as much as he admired your person  Char  I do not comprehend you Sir What engagements have I entered into inconsistent with that preference I had too hastily I fear confessed for you  Col  The ties of hearts like mine are formed by honour only Madam nor could I ever take advantage of a woman's fondness to hurt her innocence or wound her fame Lord Seaton is a more modern kind of lover Madam  Char  Lord Seaton again What can you mean by him Is he not married Sir  Col  For his unhappy lady's sake as well as yours I would he were not The woman I once loved might then have had some excuse  Char  I can sustain this injury no longerHave you not known me from my earliest youth  Col  No Madam 'tis plain I did not My fond imagination had indeed conceived a fair idea from Miss Melville's forma heart replete with honour love and constancy virtues too seldom found in your frail sex and it was vanity in me to hope I should engross so rare a treasure  Char  What have I done to forfeit your opinion But I will condescend to waive the pride of injured virtue and tell you Sir that you are much deceived  Col  I have been so I own but the delirium's fled My time is precious nowI came hither on other purpose Madam and neither thought or wished to have met you here  Char  Can it be possible the time should come when Ramsay should not wish to see me  Col  Too many hours have I alas devoted to the fond impatience of seeing her I loved'Twas the reward I promised to myself for toil for danger for the still greater pangs of absenceand how have you repaid my anxious hope  Char  If the most constant unabated tenderness and esteem could have repaid the sufferings you pretend I should not now be deemed your debtor nor would a lover such as you would seem have listened to a tale invented by some fiend to blast my honour O Ramsay 'tis now alas too plain you never loved  Col  I know not what to thinkshe speaks with confidence and looks with innocenceyet Lady Seaton surely could not invent a falshood Perhaps I have been too rash and yet I have not time to repair my error now My honour is elsewhere too far engaged at present and the time draws near  Aside  If ever we should meet again Miss Melville you will be then convinced that I have loved  Char  What do you say If ever we should meet Do not distract me Siryou must not leave me till this riddle is explained and you convinced both of my truth and love  Col  You must excuse me Madam for the present Tho' 'tis a subject of the dearest import I cannot now attend the explication    Going    Enter a Servant  Serv  Lord Seaton Madam  Exit  Char  Lord Seaton What can his visit mean  Col  O fair dissembler my doubts are all explained  Enter Lord  SEATON  Lord Sea  I come Madam to make my apology for having been tho' inadvertently the cause of any anxiety or distress to you  Char  Indeed my Lord I know not how I have deserved it but you have been the source of most mortifying difficulties and distresses to me but surely you will now be candid and generous enough to undeceive this gentleman my friendI know not what to stile himColonel Ramsay with regard to me  Col  O spare yourself and him the trouble Madam you are mistaken I am not deceived I know Lord Seaton well and know Miss Melville too  Lord Sea  Blind and ungrateful as you are to love and friendship yet for Miss Melville's sake  Col  O Sir I doubt not but for her dear sake your Lordship may generously condescend to vouch her honour with the loss of yours But my Lord you know there is another mode of satisfying me  Aside to Lord Seaton    Enter Lady  SEATON  who runs to Miss Melville and embraces her    Lady Sea  My dear my injured Charlotte I have not words to atone the wrong I have done you but hope in Colonel Ramsay to obtain an advocate more powerful than myself for your forgiveness  Col  This surely must be illusion all my feet are rooted to the spot I stand upon with wonder  Aside    Char  My dear Lady Seaton this is too good too condescending and too kind I meant to have gone to you  Lady Sea  No my friend nothing can be too much from one who has injured innocence and worth like yours by doubting of your virtue for a moment  Char  I cannot comprehend this misteryit is impossible that you should wrong me Some spell has surely been cast round me for Ramsay too has doubted of my truth and love  Lady Sea  I only I who formed the charm can break it My weak unjust suspicions have betrayed you into error your censure and resentment therefore should light on me alone  To the Colonel      Char  I am perplexedWhat can all this mean  Col  It means my Charlotte that my too hasty credulity has hurried me into a fault which I can never hope you should forgive the suspecting truth and virtue such as yours  Char  To doubt of pardon on repentance aggravates the crime for who that pretends not to perfection in themselves shall dare to be implacable to another's sailings But still I am in the dark and on the rack to know how all this strange confusion has been conjured up  Lady Sea  It arose intirely from my indiscretion in letting drop to Markam my having met you at Mrs Frankly's She happened to see the Colonel immediately after and informed him of all and perhaps more than she knew  Col  At Mrs Frankly's  Char  Yes at Mrs Frankly's Take care Colonel relapses are dangerous to susceptible constitutionsbut I shall at more leisure account to you for so extraordinary an incident  Col  And I shall most patiently wait 'till you think proper to gratify merely my curiosity in that particular  Char  But mine is not to be satisfied 'till I know how Lady Seaton should come there  Lady Sea  And I am ready to indulge you Unhappy at your absence my dear Charlotte I ordered my servant to make every possible inquiry to find you outHe saw you by chance going into Mrs Frankly's and was informed you lived there I immediately flew to request your company in hopes of agreeably surprising both you and the Colonel with an unexpected interview at my house You know the unhappy mistake occasioned then by Mrs Frankly's behaviour for which I again ask both my Lord's pardon and yours  Lord Sea  The nobleness of your behaviour upon that occasion my dear has fully entitled you to the warmest gratitude of every person present tho' you yet know not how highly meritorious your conduct has been to us all  Col  I blush to think how I have injured your Lordship by my rashness and here throw myself on your generosity for forgiveness  Lord Sea  You shall not stoop to ask it Colonelforgiveness we bestow upon our enemies but we are now and ever shall be friends  Enter a Servant  Ser  A gentleman seeing your Lordship's carriage at the door inquired if you were here and desires to speak with you  Lord Sea  I shall attend him    Exit Servant    By the degree of familiarity he uses I fancy it must be the Governor  Char  If it be my Lord pray desire him to walk up  Lord Sea  You see Madam he introduces himself without a gentlemanusher  Enter the  GOVERNOR  Gov  I have been at your house to look for you my Lord  Lord Sea  Well Governor and now you have found me what are your commands  Gov  Why my Lord I have both questions and commands to propose to you d'ye see tho' I think you have been more inclined to a game of crosspurposes than any thing else lately But in plain English I think you have behaved very ungenerously in this affair of my marriage let me tell you  Char  His marriage bless us with whom  Lord Sea  Your charge is severe Governor but prithee explain yourself for at present I don't understand you  Gov  I shall make it plain enough I warrant youI mean my Lord that you have traduced  the character of a woman whose honour I am bound to support by every principle of a man and I never yet put up with an affront nor ever will d'ye see  Lord Sea  Spoken like a champion stout and strong Governor  Gov  I don't mean to act the bravo my Lord tho' I have faced a Nabob at the head of his forces before now but all I desire of you at present is that as a man of honour you will come with me and ask Mrs Frankly's pardon before we go to church together  Lord Sea  Indeed Governor you must excuse me from going through such a ceremony and also for endeavouring to prevent your going through a more serious one with a woman who is  Gov  Don't venture to say a word against her beauty or her virtue my Lord or I may not be able to command myself perhaps  Lord Sea  The goodness and generosity of your own heart Governor render you too liable to imposition 'Tis the nature of man to impute their own principles to others be they good or bad  Gov  Why I am not apt to be suspicious that's certain and when I met you at my pretty widow's yesterday evening I little thought that we had been rivals d'ye see  Lord Sea  To convince you Sir as well as the rest of this company that I have no farther designs upon that lady I here resign into your hands the last favour I received from hers Read that Governor    Gives him Mrs Frankly's letter    Gov  Putting on his spectacles  Hey day What's this a billet to you She has been very nimble in sending it trulyI thought I had made  tolerable haste in finding you myself but my legs are none of the best to be sure  Opens the letter and reads  Notwithstanding the inhumanity of your unkind treatment of me  You see my Lord she resents your behaviour mightily  My fondness has triumphed over my resentment and I am still weak enough to desire another interview  Why what can all this mean This letter should have been directed to me  Lord Sea  Proceed Sir and the mistery will soon vanish  Gov  Tho' by seeing you again I may possibly hazard the breaking off an advantageous match with a man I detest  Hell and the furies what is this Does she mean me the crocodile of the Nile and the shark of the Ganges Had she nobody to play off her monkey tricks upon but me Detest me  Lord Sea  Compose your rage good Governor and finish the epistle  Gov  Compose the devil my Lord Why I can't see a word more of itI am struck blind with passionthis comes of my falling in love forsooth and wanting to be married to a young girl truly  Lord Sea  You are cheaply off Governor at the expence only of a little laughing and I think I have a right to my share of thatHa ha ha  Gov  Cheaply off now I think that what between money and mortification I have paid plaguy dear for my experimentbut I'll have my revenge d'ye see and shall go this moment in pursuit of it  Lord Sea  I must stop you Sir 'till your passion has subsided a little and then I will venture to trust to your good nature  Gov  Don't tell me of good nature my Lord she has made my heart as hard as a rock  Enter a Servant with a Letter to the Governor  Serv  The messenger waits for an answer Sir  Exit  Gov  What's this another billetdoux from the traitress  Char  He's in a horrid passion my Lord  Lord Sea  Not without reason I assure you Madam  Gov  Reading  I shall burst with rage There never was such a villainous proceeding A rascally coachmaker a varnishing Scoundrel I think that's his name my Lord threatens to arrest me for a debt I never contracted because the fellow thought I had been married this morning d'ye seeIt would have been a pretty sort of incident truly to have happened on one's weddingday  Lord Sea  I apprehend Governor that this would not have been the only circumstance of the kind you would have had to celebrate your nuptials if you had married that lady  Gov  No no I did not fight Gentoos Marattoes Seapoys and climates d'ye see to be bamboozled out of my money at home  Lord Sea  Except by a pretty woman Governor  Gov  Nor by her neither when I find her false and so Mr Vanish may arrest Mrs Frankly as soon as he pleases for me  Lord Sea  No Sir that debt I shall take upon myself with pleasure for the happiness I have received through Mrs Frankly's means of knowing and esteeming Lady Seaton as I ought Besides a woman in distress however incurred is always intitled to the compassion and protection of a man of honour  Gov  Nay for that matter my Lord let me have but a little of my own way d'ye see and I can be as liberal as the best of you I am passionate but not severe and so I forgive the injury and shall discharge that debt for methinks a man's mind and his means must be miserably poor indeed who cannot afford to give and forgive too  Col  Nobly said SirI find you have brought over not only the wealth but the humanity of the East Indians along with you  Lord Sea  His tastes and manners may be foreign perhaps Colonel but his goodnature and generosity are true English staple A Briton need never go a trafficking for principles  Gov  Well take me as I amI have bought some wisdom for myself at present for I shall not so readily believe that the women are in love with me now as they might have been some thirty years ago And so I shall think no more about a wife for some time at least d'ye see unless I should renew my courtship to my old passion Miss Melville here  Char  Take care of that Governor lest you should make the Colonel jealous  Gov  Nay if you are inclined to list with him d'ye see I'll keep clear of you for 'tis dangerous meddling with other men's wives nowadays I hear  Col  If our modern marriages Sir were contracted upon the same principles I flatter myself ours is likely to be a thorough love and esteem for each other we should neither have so many libertine husbands or faithless wives  True worth alone can form the charm that binds  And rivet beauty's chains upon the mind  END OF THE FIFTH ACT  EPILOGUE  BY A FRIEND Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  'TIS very fine indeed all match'd I see  All happy all provided for but me  Blown up and ruin'd here'tis a strange notion  You'll say but I'm resolv'd to

face would charm they say  Amongst the copper beauties of Bombay  And she who in a croud would scarcely pass  With us would be a Venus at Madrass  Pantheon Opera Playhouse Fantoccini  FarewelI'll go and be a Nabobini  Or if that scheme perchance should not succeed  E'en wed a Seapoy chief and mend the breed  What if one's husband is a little frightful  Where every thing besides is so delightful  'Twill be so charming on a summer's day  For forty slaves to fan me as I lay  Or on rich carpets free from noise and hurry  Sit crosslegg'd with my spouse and feast on Cury  If I've a taste for baubles my good man  Will load me with old China and Japan  Diamonds on diamonds heap'd and pearly rows  For hair ears neck and breast perhaps my nose  No filthy hackneys there so poor and mean  Give me twelve Seapoys and a palanqui    I'll keep a little squadron at my call  And make my first grand visit in a shaul  But must I leave my little Bull behind  No hang it after all 'twould be unkind  The fellow may be useful he shall go  For he can write or  underwrite  you know  And many a worse I heard a sweet bird sing  Goes out a writer and comes home a king  A writer here is quite another thing  So says our female author of tonight  Poor soul I hear she's in a horrid fright  She has sent her little vessel off to sea  And I am factor for the company  Grant her ye Critics a few prosperous gales  Let your applause but fill our swelling sails  Do you insure her cargo safe and sound  And Bull shall underwrite five hundred pound  The author for your passport trembling stands  And hopes you'll grant it  under all your hands    FINIS
