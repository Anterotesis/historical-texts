CANDIDATE  ENOUGH of  Actors  let them play the play'r  And free from censure fret sweat strut and stare  GARRICK abroad what motives can engage  To waste one couplet on a barren stage  Ungrateful GARRICK when these  tasty  days  In justice to themselves allow'd thee praise  When at thy bidding Sense for twenty years  Indulg'd in laughter or dissolv'd in tears  When in return for labour time and health  The Town had giv'n some little share of wealth  Could'st Thou repine at being still a slave  Dar'st Thou presume t' enjoy that wealth She gave  Could'st Thou repine at laws ordain'd by Those  Whom nothing but thy merit made thy foes  Whom too refin'd for honesty and trade  By need made tradesmen Pride had Bankrupts made  Whom Fear made Drunkards and by modern rules  Whom Drink made Wits tho' Nature made them Fools  With Such beyond all pardon is thy crime  In such a manner and at such a time  To quit the stage but Men of real Sense  Who neither lightly give nor take offence  Shall own Thee clear or pass an act of grace  Since Thou hast left a POWELL in thy place  Enough of  Authors  why when Scribblers fail  Must other Scribblers spread the hateful tale  Why must they pity why contempt express  And why insult a Brother in distress  Let Those who boast th' uncommon gift of brains  The Laurel pluck and wear it for their pains  Fresh on their brows for ages let It bloom  And ages past still flourish round their tomb  Let Those who without Genius write and write  Versemen or Prosemen all in Nature's spite  The Pen laid down their course of Folly run  In peace unread unmention'd be undone  Why should I tell to cross the will of fate  That FRANCIS once endeavour'd to translate  Why sweet Oblivion winding round his head  Should I recall poor MURPHY from the dead  Why may not LANGHORNE simple in his lay  Effusion  on  Effusion  pour away  With  Friendship  and with  Fancy  trifle here  Or sleep in  Pastoral  at BELVIDERE  Sleep let them all with DULLNESS on her throne  Secure from any malice but their own  Enough of  Critics  let them if they please  Fond of new pomp each month pass new decrees  Wide and extensive be their infant State  Their Subjects many and those Subjects great  Whilst all their mandates as sound Law succeed  With Fools who write and greater fools who read  What tho' they lay the realms of Genius waste  Fetter the Fancy and debauch the Taste  Tho' They like Doctors to approve their skill  Consult not how to cure but how to kill  Tho' by whim envy or resentment led  They damn those authors whom they never read  Tho' other rules unknown one rule they hold  To deal out so much praise for to much gold  Tho'  Scot  with  Scot  in damned close intrigues  Against the Commonwealth of Letters leagues  Uncensur'd let them Pilot at the helm  And rule in Letters as they rul'd the realm  Ours be the curse the mean tame Coward's curse  Nor could Ingenious Malice make a worse  To do our Sense and Honour deep despite  To credit what They say read what They write  Enough of  Scotland  let her rest in peace  The cause remov'd effects of course should cease  Why should I tell how  Tweed  too mighty grown  And proudly swell'd with waters not his own  Burst o'er his banks and by destruction led  O'er our fair ENGLAND desolation spread  Whilst riding on his waves Ambition plum'd  In tenfold pride the port of BUTE assum'd  Now that the River God convinc'd tho' late  And yielding tho' reluctantly to fate  Holds his fair course and with more humble tides  In tribute to the sea as usual glides  Enough of  States  and such like trifling things  Enough of Kinglings and enough of Kings  Henceforth secure let ambush'd Statesmen lie  Spread the Court web and catch the Patriot fly  Henceforth unwhipt of Justice uncontroul'd  By fear or shame let Vice secure and bold  Lord it with all her sons whilst Virtue's groan  Meets with compassion only from the Throne  Enough of  Patriots  all I ask of man  Is only to be honest as he can  Some have deceiv'd and some may still deceive  'Tis the Fool's curse at random to believe  Would those who by Opinion plac'd on high  Stand fair and perfect in their Country's eye  Maintain that honour let me in their ear  Hint this essential doctrine  Persevere    Should They which Heav'n forbid to win the grace  Of some proud Courtier or to gain a place  Their King and Country Sell with endless shame  Th' avenging Muse shall mark each trait'rous name  But if to Honour true they scorn to bend  And proudly honest hold out to the end  Their grateful Country shall their fame record  And I Myself descend to praise a Lord  Enough of  Wilkes  with good and honest men  His actions speak much stronger than my pen  And future ages shall his name adore  When he can act and I can write no more  ENGLAND may prove ungrateful and unjust  But fost'ring FRANCE shall ne'er betray her trust  'Tis a brave debt which Gods on men impose  To pay with praise the merit e'en of foes  When the great Warriour of Amilcar's race  Made ROME's wide Empire tremble to her base  To prove her Virtue tho' it gall'd her pride  ROME gave that fame which CARTHAGE had denied  Enough of  Self  that darling luscious theme  O'er which Philosophers in raptures dream  On which with seeming disregard they write  Then prizing most when most they seem to slight  Vain proof of Folly tinctur'd strong with pride  What Man can from himself himself divide  For Me nor dare I lie my leading aim  Conscience first satisfied is love of Fame  Some little Fame deriv'd from some brave few  Who prizing Honour prize her Vot'ries too  Let All nor shall resentment flush my cheek  Who know me well what they know freely speak  So Those the greatest curse I meet below  Who know me not may not pretend to know  Let none of Those whom bless'd with parts above  My feeble Genius still I dare to love  Doing more mischief than a thousand foes  Posthumous  nonsense to the world expose  And call it mine for mine tho' never known  Or which if mine I living blush'd to own  Know all the World  no greedy heir shall find  Die when I will one couplet left behind  Let none of Those whom I despise tho' great  Pretending Friendship to give malice weight  Publish my life let no false sneaking peer  Some such there are to win the public ear  Hand me to shame with some vile anecdote  Nor soulgall'd Bishop damn me with a note  Let one poor sprig of Bay around my head  Bloom whilst I live and point me out when dead  Let It may Heav'n indulgent grant that pray'r  Be planted on my grave nor wither there  And when on travel bound some riming guest  Roams thro' the Churchyard whilst his Dinner's dress'd  Let It hold up this Comment to his eyes  Life to the last enjoy'd  here  Churchill lies  Whilst O what joy that pleasing flatt'ry gives  Reading my Works he cries  here  Churchill lives  Enough of  Satire  in less harden'd times  Great was her force and mighty were her rimes  I've read of Men beyond Man's daring brave  Who yet have trembled at the strokes she gave  Whose souls have felt more terrible alarms  From her one line than from a world in arms  When in her faithful and immortal page  They saw transmitted down from age to age  Recorded Villains and each spotted name  Branded with marks of everlasting shame  Succeeding Villains sought her as a friend  And if not really mended feign'd to mend  But in an age when actions are allow'd  Which strike all Honour dead and crimes avow'd  Too terrible to suffer the report  Avow'd and prais'd by men who stain a Court  Propp'd by the arm of Pow'r when Vice highborn  Highbred highstation'd holds rebuke in scorn  When She is lost to ev'ry thought of fame  And to all Virtue dead is dead to shame  When Prudence a much easier task must hold  To make a new World than reform the old  SATIRE throws by her arrows on the ground  And if She cannot cure She will not wound  Come PANEGYRICKtho' the MUSE disdains  Founded on Truth to prostitute her strains  At the base instance of those men who hold  No argument but pow'r no God but Gold  Yet mindful that from heav'n She drew her birth  She scorns the narrow maxims of this earth  Virtuous herself brings Virtue forth to view  And loves to praise where praise is justly due  Come PANEGYRICKin a former hour  My soul with pleasure yielding to thy pow'r  Thy shrine I sought I pray'dbut wanton air  Before it reach'd thy ears dispers'd my pray'r  E'en at thy altars whilst I took my stand  The pen of Truth and Honour in my hand  Fate meditating wrath 'gainst me and mine  Chid my fond zeal and thwarted my design  Whilst HAYTER brought too quickly to his end  I lost a Subject and Mankind a friend  Come PANEGYRICKbending at thy throne  Thee and thy Pow'r my soul is proud to own  Be Thou my kind Protector Thou my Guide  And lead me safe thro' passes yet untry'd  Broad is the road nor difficult to find  Which to the house of  Satire  leads mankind  Narrow and unfrequented are the ways  Scarce found out in an age which lead to Praise  What tho' no theme I chuse of vulgar note  Nor wish to write as Brother Bards have wrote  So mild so meek in praising that they seem  Afraid to wake their Patrons from a dream  What tho' a theme I chuse which might demand  The nicest touches of a Master's hand  Yet if the inward workings of my soul  Deceive me not I shall attain the goal  And Envy shall behold in triumph rais'd  The Poet praising and the Patron prais'd  What Patron shall I chuse shall public voice  Or private knowledge influence my choice  Shall I prefer the grand retreat of STOWE  Or seeking Patriots to friend WILDMAN's go  To WILDMAN's cried DISCRETION who had heard  Closestanding at my elbow ev'ry word  To WILDMAN's art Thou mad can'st Thou be sure  One moment there to have thy head secure  Are they not All let observation tell  All mark'd in Characters as black as Hell  In  Doomsday  book by Ministers set down  Who stile their pride the honour of the crown  Make no replylet Reason stand aloof  Presumptions here must pass as solemn proof  That settled Faith that Love which ever springs  In the best Subjects for the best of Kings  Must not be measur'd now by what Men think  Or say or doby what They eat and drink  Where and with whom that Question's to be try'd  And Statesmen are the Judges to decide  No Juries call'd or if call'd kept in awe  They facts confest in themselves vest the law  Each dish at WILDMAN's of sedition smacks  Blasphemy may be Gospel at ALMACK's  Peace good DISCRETION peacethy fears are vain  Ne'er will I herd with WILDMAN's factious train  Never the vengeance of the great incur  Nor without might against the mighty stir  If from long proof my temper you distrust  Weigh my profession to my gown be just  Dost Thou one Parson know so void of grace  To pay his court to Patrons out of place  If still you doubt tho' scarce a doubt remains  Search thro' my alter'd heart and try my reins  There searching find nor deem me now in sport  A Convert made by SANDWICH to the Court  Let Madmen follow error to the end  I of mistakes convinc'd and proud to mend  Strive to act better being better taught  Nor blush to own that change which Reason wrought▪  For such a change as this must Justice speak  My heart was honest but my head was weak  Bigot to no one Man or set of Men  Without one selfish view I drew my pen  My Country ask'd or seem'd to ask my aid  Obedient to that call I left off trade  A side I chose and on that side was strong  'Till time hath fairly prov'd me in the wrong  Convinc'd I change can any Man do more  And have not greater Patriots chang'd before  Chang'd I at once can any man do less  Without a single blush that change confess  Confess it with a manly kind of Pride  And quit the losing for the winning side  Granting whilst virtuous SANDWICH holds the rein  What BUTE for ages might have sought in vain  Hail  SANDWICHnor shall WILKES resentment shew  Hearing the praises of so brave a foe  Hail  SANDWICHnor thro' pride shalt Thou refuse  The grateful tribute of so mean a Muse  SANDWICH  All Hail  when BUTE with foreign hand  Grown wanton with ambition scourg'd the land  When  Scots  or slaves to  Scotsmen  steer'd the helm  When Peace inglorious Peace disgrac'd the realm  Distrust and gen'ral discontent prevail'd  But when he best knows why his spirits fail'd  When with a sudden panic struck he fled  Sneak'd out of pow'r and hid his recreant head  When like a MARS fear order'd to retreat  We saw Thee nimbly vault into his seat  Into the seat of pow'r atone bold leap  A perfect Connoisseur in Statemanship  When like another MACHIAVEL we saw  Thy fingers twisting and untwisting law  Straining where godlike Reason bade and where  She warranted thy Mercy pleas'd to spare  Saw Thee resolv'd and fix'd come what come might  To do thy God thy King thy Country right  All things were chang'd suspence remain'd no more  Certainty reign'd where doubt had reign'd before  All felt thy virtues and all knew their use  What Virtues such as thine must needs produce  Thy Foes for Honour ever meets with foes  Too mean to praise too fearful to oppose  In sullen silence sit thy Friends some Few  Who friends to Thee are Friends to Honour too  Plaud thy brave bearing and the Commonweal  Expects her safety from thy stubborn zeal  A place amongst the rest the Muses claim  And bring this freewill off'ring to thy fame  To prove their virtue make thy virtues known  And holding up thy fame secure their own  From his youth upwards to the present day  When Vices more than years have mark'd him grey  When riotous excess with wasteful hand  Shakes life's frail glass and hastes each ebbing sand  Unmindful from what stock he drew his birth  Untainted with one deed of real worth  LOTHARIO holding Honour at no price  Folly to Folly added Vice to Vice  Wrought sin with greediness and sought for shame  With greater zeal than good men seek for fame  Where Reason left without the least defence  Laughter was Mirth Obscenity was Sense  Where Impudence made Decency submit  Where Noise was Humour and where Whim was Wit  Where rude untemper'd License had the merit  Of Liberty and Lunacy was Spirit  Where the best things were ever held the worst  LOTHARIO was with justice always first  To whip a Top to knuckle down at Taw  To swing upon a gate to ride a straw  To play at PushPin with dull brother Peers  To belch out Catches in a Porter's ears  To reign the monarch of a midnight cell  To be the gaping Chairman's Oracle  Whilst in most blessed union rogue and whore  Clap hands huzza and hiccup out Encore  Whilst  grey  Authority who slumbers there  In robes of Watchman's fur gives up his chair  With midnight howl to bay th' affrighted Moon  To walk with torches thro' the streets at noon  To force plain nature from her usual way  Each night a vigil and a blank each day  To match for speed one Feather 'gainst another  To make one leg run races with his brother  'Gainst all the rest to take the northern wind  BUTE to ride first and He to ride behind  To coin newfangled wagers and to lay 'em  Laying to lose and losing not to pay 'em  LOTHARIO on that stock which Nature gives  Without a rival stands tho' MARCH yet lives  When FOLLY at that name in duty bound  Let subject Myriads kneel and kiss the ground  Whilst They who in the presence upright stand  Are held as rebels thro' the loyal land  Queen ev'ry where but most a Queen in Courts  Sent forth her heralds and proclaim'd her sports  Bade fool with fool on her behalf engage  And prove her right to reign from age to age  LOTHARIO great above the common size  With all engag'd and won from all the prize  Her Cap he wears which from his Youth he wore  And ev'ry day deserves it more and more  Nor in such limits rests his soul confin'd  Folly may share but can't engross his mind  Vice bold substantial Vice puts in her claim  And stamps him perfect in the books of shame  Observe his Follies well and You would swear  Folly had been his first his only care  Observe his Vices You'll that oath disown  And swear that he was born for Vice alone  Is the soft Nature of some easy Maid  Fond easy full of faith to be betray'd  Must She to Virtue lost be lost to fame  And He who wrought her guilt declare her shame  Is some brave Friend who men but little known  Deems ev'ry heart as honest as his own  And free himself in others fears no guile  To be ensnar'd and ruin'd with a smile  Is Law to be perverted from her course  Is abject fraud to league with brutal force  Is Freedom to be crush'd and ev'ry son  Who dares maintain her cause to be undone  Is base Corruption creeping thro' the land  To plan and work her ruin underhand  With regular approaches sure tho' slow  Or must she perish by a single blow  Are Kings who trust to servants and depend  In servants fond vain thought to find a friend  To be abus'd and made to draw their breath  In darkness thicker than the shades of death  Is God's most holy name to be profan'd  His word rejected and his laws arraign'd  His servants scorn'd as men who idly dream'd  His service laugh'd at and his Son blasphem'd  Are Debauchees in Morals to preside  Is Faith to take an Atheist for her guide  Is Science by a Blockhead to be led  Are States to totter on a Drunkard's head  To answer all these purposes and more  More black than ever Villain plann'd before  Search Earth search Hell the Devil cannot find  An Agent like LOTHARIO to his mind  Is this Nobility which sprung from Kings  Was meant to swell the pow'r from whence it springs  Is this the glorious produce this the fruit  Which Nature hop'd for from so rich a root  Were there but two search all the world around  Were there but two such Nobles to be found  The very name would sink into a term  Of scorn and Man would rather be a worm  Than be a Lord but Nature full of grace  Nor meaning birth and titles to debase  Made only One and having made him swore  In mercy to mankind to make no more  Nor stopp'd She there but like a gen'rous friend  The ills which Error caus'd She strove to mend  And having brought LOTHARIO forth to view  To save her credit brought forth SANDWICH too  Gods with what joy what honest joy of heart  Blunt as I am and void of ev'ry art  Of ev'ry art which great Ones in the state  Practice on knaves they fear and fools they hate  To Titles with reluctance taught to bend  Nor prone to think that Virtues can descend  Do I behold a sight alas more rare  Than honesty could wish the Noble wear  His Father's honours when his life makes known  They're his by Virtue not by birth alone  When he recalls his Father from the grave  And pays with int'rest back that fame he gave  Cur'd of her splenetic and sullen fits  To such a Peer my willing soul submits  And to such virtue is more proud to yield  Than 'gainst ten titled rogues to keep the field  Such for that Truth e'en Envy shall allow  Such WYNDHAM was and such is SANDWICH now  O gentle MONTAGUE in blessed hour  Didst thou start up and climb the stairs of pow'r  ENGLAND of all her fears at once was eas'd  Nor 'mongst her many foes was One displeas'd  FRANCE heard the news and told it  Cousin  SPAIN  SPAIN heard and told it  Cousin  FRANCE again  The HOLLANDER relinquish'd his design  Of adding spice to spice and mine to mine  Of Indian villainies he thought no more  Content to rob us on our native shore  Aw'd by thy fame which winds with open mouth  Shall blow from East to West from North to South  The western world shall yield us her increase  And her wild Sons be soften'd into peace  Rich Eastern Monarchs shall exhaust their stores  And pour unbounded wealth on Albion's shores  Unbounded wealth which from those golden scenes  And  all acquir'd by honourable means    Some  honourable Chief  shall hither steer  To pay our debts and set the nation clear  NABOBS themselves allur'd by thy renown  Shall pay due homage to the English crown  Shall freely as their King our King receive  PROVIDED  the Directors give them leave    Union at home shall mark each rising year  Nor taxes be complain'd of tho' severe  Envy her own destroyer shall become  And Faction with her thousand mouths be dumb  With the meek man thy Meekness shall prevail  Nor with the spirited thy spirit fail  Some to thy force of reason shall submit  And some be converts to thy princely Wit  Rev'rence for Thee shall still a Nation's cries  A grand concurrence crown a grand excise  And Unbelievers of the first degree  Who have no faith in God have faith in Thee  When a strange jumble whimsical and vain  Possess'd the region of each heated brain  When some were fools to censure some to praise  And all were mad but mad in diff'rent ways  When Commonwealth'smen starting at the shade  Which in their own wild fancy had been made  Of Tyrants dream'd who wore a thorny crown  And with StateBloodhounds hunted Freedom down  When Others struck with Fancies not less vain  Saw mighty Kings by their own subjects slain  And in each friend of Liberty and Law  With horrour big a future CROMWELL saw  Thy manly zeal stepp'd forth bade discord cease  And sung each jarring atom into peace  LIBERTY chear'd by thy allchearing eye  Shall waking from her trance live and not die  And patroniz'd by Thee PREROGATIVE  Shall striding forth at large not die but live  Whilst PRIVILEGE hung betwixt earth and sky  Shall not well know whether to live or die  When on a rock which overhung the flood  And seem'd to totter COMMERCE shiv'ring stood  When CREDIT building on a sandy shore  Saw the sea swell and heard the Tempest roar  Heard death in ev'ry blast and in each wave  Or saw or fancied that She saw her grave  When PROPERTY transferr'd from hand to hand  Weak'ned by change crawl'd sickly thro' the land  When mutual Confidence was at an end  And Man no longer could on Man depend  Oppress'd with debts of more than common weight  When all men fear'd a bankruptcy of state  When certain death to honour and to trade  A Sponge was talk'd of as our only aid  That to be sav'd we must be more undone  And pay off all our debts by paying none  Like England's better Genius born to bless  And snatch his sinking country from distress  Did'st Thou step forth and without sail or oar  Pilot the shatter'd vessel safe to shore  Nor shalt Thou quit till anchor'd firm and fast  She rides secure and mocks the threat'ning blast  Born in thy house and in thy service bred  Nurs'd in thy arms and at thy table fed  By thy sage counsels to reflection brought  Yet more by pattern than by precept taught  OECONOMY her needful aid shall join  To forward and compleat thy grand design  And warm to save but yet with Spirit warm  Shall her own conduct from thy conduct form  Let Friends of Prodigals say what they will  Spendthrifts at home abroad are Spendthrifts still  In vain have sly and subtle Sophists tried  Private from public Justice to divide  For Credit on each other they rely  They live together and together die  'Gainst all experience 'tis a rank offence  High Treason in the eye of Common Sense  To think a Statesman ever can be known  To pay our debts who will not pay his own  But now tho' late now may we hope to see  Our debts discharg'd our Credit fair and free  Since rigid Honesty fair fall that hour  Sits at the helm and SANDWICH is in pow'r  With what delight I view the wond'rous Man  With what delight survey thy sterling plan  That plan which All with wonder must behold  And stamp thy age the only age of gold  Nor rest thy triumphs hereThat Discord fled  And sought with grief the hell where She was bred  That Faction 'gainst her Nature forc'd to yield  Saw her rude rabble scatter'd o'er the field  Saw her best friends a standing jest become  Her Fools turn'd speakers and her Wits struck dumb  That our most bitter Foes so much depends  On Men of name are turn'd to cordial friends  That our offended Friends such terrour flows  From Men of name dare not appear our foes  That Credit gasping in the jaws of death  And ready to expire with ev'ry breath  Grows stronger from disease that Thou hast sav'd  Thy drooping Country that thy name engrav'd  On plates of brass defies the rage of time  Than plates of brass more firm that sacred Rime  Embalms thy mem'ry bids thy glories live  And gives Thee what the Muse alone can give  These heights of virtue these rewards of Fame  With Thee in common other Patriots claim  But that poor sickly SCIENCE who had laid  And droop'd for years beneath neglect's cold shade  By those who knew her purposely forgot  And made the jest of those who knew her not  Whilst Ignorance in pow'r and Pamper'd Pride  Clad like a Priest pass'd by on t'other side  Recover'd from her wretched state at length  Puts on new health and cloathes herself with strength  To Thee we owe and to thy friendly hand  Which rais'd and gave her to possess the land  This praise tho' in a court and near a throne  This praise is thine and thine alas alone  With what fond rapture did the Goddess smile  What blessings did she promise to this Isle  What honour to herself and length of reign  Soon as She heard that Thou did'st not disdain  To be her Steward but what grief what shame  What rage what disappointment shook her frame  When her proud children dar'd her will dispute  When Youth was insolent and Age was mute  That Young Men should be fools and some wild few  To Wisdom deaf be deaf to int'rest too  Mov'd not her wonder but that Men grown grey  In search of Wisdom Men who own'd the sway  Of Reason Men who stubbornly kept down  Each rising passion Men who wore the gown  That They should cross her will That They should dare  Against the cause of int'rest to declare  That They should be so abject and unwise  Having no fear of loss before their eyes  Nor hopes of gain scorning the ready means  Of being Vicars Rectors Canons Deans  With all those honours which on Mitres wait  And mark the virtuous favourites of state  That They should dare a HARDWICK to support  And talk within the hearing of a Court  Of that vile beggar Conscience who undone  And starv'd herself starves ev'ry wretched son  This turn'd her blood to gall This made her swear  No more to throw away her time and care  On wayward Sons who scorn'd her love no more  To hold her courts on CAM's ungrateful shore  Rather than bear such insults which disgrace  Her royalty of Nature birth and place  Tho' DULLNESS there unrivall'd State  doth  keep  Would She at WINCHESTER with BURTON sleep  Or to exchange the mortifying scene  For something still more dull and still more mean  Rather than bear such insults She would fly  Far far beyond the search of  English  eye  And reign amongst the SCOTS to be a Queen  Is worth ambition tho' in ABERDEEN  O stay thy flight fair SCIENCE what tho' some  Some baseborn children Rebels are become  All are not Rebels some are duteous still  Attend thy precepts and obey thy will  Thy int'rest is oppos'd by those alone  Who either know not or oppose their own  Of Stubborn Virtue marching to thy aid  Behold in black the liv'ry of their trade  Marshall'd by form and by Discretion led  A grave grave troop and SMITH is at their head  Black SMITH of TRINITY on Christian ground  For Faith in Mysteries none more renown'd  Next for the best of causes now and then  Must beg assistance from the worst of men  Next if old Story lies not sprung from Greece  Comes PANDARUS but comes without his Niece  Her wretched Maid committed to his trust  To a rank Letcher's

Smuggled from JERSEY and the ISLE of MAN  Are there not PHILOMATHS of high degree  Who always dumb before shall speak for thee  Are there not PROCTORS faithful to thy will  One of full growth others in Embryo still  Who may perhaps in some ten years or more  Be ascertain'd that Two and Two make four  Or may a still more happy method find  And taking One from too leave none behind  With such a mighty pow'r on foot to yield  Were death to Manhood better in the field  To leave our Carcases and die with fame  Than fly and purchase life on terms of shame▪  SACKVILLES alone anticipate defeat  And e're they dare the battle sound retreat  But if Persuasions ineffectual prove  If Arguments are vain nor Pray'rs can move  Yet in thy bitterness of frantic woe  Why talk of BURTON why to SCOTLAND go  Is there not OXFORD She with open arms  Shall meet thy wish and yield up all her charms  Shall for thy love her former loves resign  And jilt the banish'd STUARTS to be thine  Bow'd to the yoke and soon as she could read  Tutor'd to get by heart the Despot's Creed  She of subjection proud shall knee thy throne  And have no principles but thine alone  She shall thy will implicitely receive  Nor act or speak or think without thy leave  Where is the glory of imperial sway  If subjects none but just commands obey  Then and then only is obedience seen  When by command they dare do all that's

Shall hail his SANDWICH with that virtuous zeal  That glorious ardour for the Commonweal  Which warm'd his loyal heart and bless'd his tongue  When on his lips the cause of Rebels hung  Whilst Womanhood in habit of a Nun  At M lies by backward Monks undone  A nation's reck'ning like an alehouse score  Whilst PAUL  the aged  chalks behind a door  Compell'd to hire a foe to cast it up  shall

Curs'd in herself by her own thoughts undone  Where She sees all but can be seen by none  Where She no longer Mistress of the schools  Hears Praise loud pealing from the mouth of fools  Or hears it at

It serves twelve hours tho' not enough for one  KING shall arise and bursting from the dead  Shall hurl his  piebald  Latin at thy head▪  BURTON whilst awkward Affectation's hung  In quaint and labour'd accents on his tongue  Who 'gainst their will makes Junior Blockheads speak  Ign'rant of both new Latin and new Greek  Not such as was in Greece and Latium known  But of a modern cut and all

Thoughts all so dull so pliant in their growth  They're Verse They're Prose They're Neither and They're Both  Shall tho' by Nature ever loth to praise  Thy curious worth set sorth in curious phrase  Obscurely stiff shall press poor Sense to death  Or in long periods run her out of breath  Shall make a babe for which with all his fame  ADAM could not have found a proper name  Whilst beating out his features to a smile  He hugs the bastard brat and calls it STILE  Hush'd be all Nature as the land of Death  Let each Stream sleep and each wind hold his breath  Be the Bells muffled nor one sound of care  Pressing for Audience wake the slumb'ring air  BROWNE comes behold how cautiously he creeps  How slow he walks and yet how fast he sleeps  But to thy praise in sleep he shall agree  He cannot wake but he shall dream of Thee  PHYSICK her head with opiate Poppies crown'd  Her loins by the chaste matron Camphire bound  PHYSICK obtaining succour from the pen  Of her soft son her gentle HEBERDEN  If there are Men who can thy virtue know  Yet spite of Virtue treat Thee as a foe  Shall like a  Scholar  stop their rebel breath  And in each RECIPE send  Classic  death  So deep in knowledge that few lines can sound  And plumb the bottom of that vast profound  Few grave ones with such gravity can think  Or follow half so fast as he can sink  With nice distinctions glossing o'er the text  Obscure with meaning and in words perplext  With subtleties on subtleties refin'd  Meant to divide and subdivide the mind  Keeping the forwardness of Youth in awe  The Scowling BLACKISTON bears the train of LAW  DIVINITY enrob'd in College fur  In her right hand a  New Court Calendar    Bound like a Book of Pray'r thy coming waits  With all her pack to hymn Thee in the gates  LOYALTY fix'd on ISIS' alter'd shore  A stranger long but stranger now no more  Shall pitch her tabernacle and with eyes  Brimfull of rapture view her new allies  Shall with much pleasure and more wonder view  Men great at Court and great at Oxford too  O Sacred LOYALTY accurs'd be those  Who seeming friends turn out thy deadliest foes  Who prostitute to Kings thy honour'd name  And soothe their passions to betray their fame  Nor prais'd be those to whose proud Nature clings  Contempt of government and hate of Kings  Who willing to be free not knowing how  A strange intemperance of zeal avow  And start at LOYALTY as at a word  Which without danger FREEDOM never heard  Vain errors of vain menwild both extremes  And to the State not wholesome like the dreams  Children of night of indigestion bred  Which Reason clouded seize and turn the head  LOYALTY without FREEDOM is a chain  Which Men of lib'ral notice can't sustain  And FREEDOM without LOYALTY a name  Which nothing means or means licentious shame  Thine be the art my SANDWICH thine the toil  In OXFORD's stubborn and untoward stile  To rear this plant of Union till at length  Rooted by time and foster'd into strength  Shooting aloft all danger It defies  And proudly lifts its branches to the skies  Whilst Wisdom's happy son but not her slave  Gay with the gay and with the grave ones grave  Free from the dull impertinence of thought  Beneath that shade which thy own labours Wrought  And fashion'd into strength shalt Thou repose  Secure of lib'ral praise since ISIS flows  True to her TAME as duty hath decreed  Nor longer like a harlot lust for TWEED  And those old wreaths which OXFORD once dar'd twine  To grace a STUART brow she plants on thine  THE END
