advisable to retain it  This Moth is uncommonly scarce in Great Britain The larva is of a pale or greenish white colour with three longitudinal stripes of brown and a few black bars across It feeds on the Willow and Alder Four of those larvae were taken in the wood of Darent and one of them was reared to the winged state  FIG II PHALAENA ALNI  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  AND  SYNONYMS  Thorax crested

the English Aurelian though the Moth itself is in the possession of few The larva  was figured and described by Albin and collectors about the middle of the last century occasionally met with it in the woods near Lon∣don which have been since destroyed At that time it was however scarce and being difficult to rear the Moth has always been deemed one of the most valuable British species of the Lepidoptera tribe  An old collector at Hoxton once informed us that the larva of this Insect was called the BREECHES Caterpillar about fifty years ago that it was in great request by most collectors of his time and that he deemed himself fortunate in finding two specimens of it in the course of his life though he had not reared either Those were taken on some Chestnut trees which grew at that time in St George's fields The late Mr Bentley found it once on the Beech and Mr Francillon has a specimen of it in his cabinet which he met with himself Our figures are copied from Mr Francillon's

not more remarkable for its singularity than rarity for we have ventured to introduce it as an English Insect on one authority onlyA specimen of it was lately taken by the Rev James Coyte of Ipswich

The late Duchess of Portland it is reported once found a muti∣lated wing of some Phalaena hanging in a cobweb which it was conjectured had belonged to this species but on such slender au∣thority few were disposed to consider it as a British Insect and thence it remained a subject of dispute till the summer of when our worthy friend W Jones Esq met with a charming specimen of it alive in his own garden at Chelsea and thereby removed every doubt respecting it as a British Species  The larva feeds on the Larkspur and is figured by Roesel toge∣ther with the eggs and pupa those figures we have copied in the annexed plate as they render the history of this interesting Insect more complete than our limited information would otherwise permit The larva seems to bear some resemblance to those of Phalaena Verbasci or Water Betony Moth the colours are nearly the same but the black spots in the former are more numerous  PLATE CCCXXXII BLATTA LAPPONICA HEMIPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Head inflected

wings which Linnaeus describes It has since been discovered in the neighbourhood of Battersea and we deem it too interesting to be omitted  The yellow colour of the wings can by no means induce us to think it a distinct species from the variety with wings perfectly transparent especially as the same variation is observed in most other species of the same tribe and particularly amongst the English species in flaveola virgo and puella The marks and colours of the abdomen and thorax are still more liable to variation and can scarcely furnish any precise character for a specific difference  PLATE

the superior wings To the first he assigns twenty and to the latter fifty on each wing  Those who have attended particularly to those species are aware that the number of spots are by no means constant and may have frequently observed even more spots on one wing than the other in the same individual as occurs in the specimen we have figured This has occasioned some confusion between the two species and we ex∣pressed some doubts respecting them in the description of one of the  earliest plates in this work Since that time we have had more op∣portunities of ascertaining the two kinds and have no hesitation in admitting them as two species Not that the variation in the number of spots will allow us to admit the definition of Linnaeus uncondi∣tionally It may be said that those on the P Padella are about twenty and those on the P Evonymella sometimes amount to fifty or more and the colour of the superior wings is lighter in the latter than the former  In admitting this the name Evonymella adopted in the ninth plate must be changed to Padella and the Insect before us be considered as the true Evonymella  FIG V PHALAENA FALCATELLA TRIANGLEMARKED LIGHT HOOKTIP  SPECIFIC
