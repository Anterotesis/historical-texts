HIGHNESS  MADAM  _SINCE I am allow'd the honour and Privilege of so easy Access to Your Royal Highness I dare say I shall not be the worse receiv'd for bringing  Ovid  along with me He comes from Banishment to the Fautress of Liberty from the Barbarous to the Polite and has this to recommend him which never fails with a Clemency like Your's He is Unfortunate  Your Royal Highness who feels for every one has lately been the mournful Occasion of a like Sensibility in many Others Scarce an Eye that did not tell the Danger You were in Even Parties tho'different in Principles united at that time in their grief and affectionate concern for an event of so much consequence to the Interest of Humanity and Virtue whilst Your Self was the only Person Then unmov'd  It was remarkable That She who with a Manner most engaging taught the innocent Pleasures to appear more desirable than the criminal who was every day the Life of some new agreeable Diversion should behave Her Self upon that cruel Tryal with a Magnanimity so unshaken that those who were Witnesses might have imagin'd She scarce ever had done any thing but study how to Dye  It is the greatest Happiness can attend an Age under a long depravation of Morals to be blest with Examples where Virtue is set off by the advantage of Birth Such Qualifications when united do not only persuade an Imitation but Command it Humane Nature is always more affected by what it sees than what it hears of And as those Ideas which enter by the Eye find the surest passage to the Heart so the more the Object whatever it be seems desirable to the One the longer it continues in the Other  There are Perfections so shining that one must be the very Worst of Mortals or the very Best not to admire in all Those who possess them To be blest with a disposition to Charity not confin'd by any other Limits than the Modesty of those who ask It To know and be ready  to excuse Faults yet so strict in Life as not to want the like Indulgence To have a Superiority of Genius capable of judging of the highest Affairs and an Application so observant as to penetrate into the most Minute To be easy to lay down Grandeur upon familiar Occasions and discerning to take It up when Dignity of Station requires To know the politer Languages of the present Age as a Native and the greater Occurrences and Periods of the Past as an Historian make up a Character which is so obvious that Every one will know where to apply it except the Person whose it really is and if in this Your Royal Highness be at a Loss I think it is the only thing within the Province of Your Sex You are ignorant of  I shall take up no more of Your time in this Dedication because to do every thing that may be most acceptable to You shall always be the Endeavour of  MADAM  Your  ROYAL HIGHNESS  's most Humble and most Obedient Servant  S GARTH  PREFACE  _THE Method I propose in writing this Preface is to take Notice of some of the Beauties of the  Metamorphoses  and also of the Faults and particular Affectations After which I shall proceed to hint at some Rules for Translation in general and shall give a short Account of the following Version  I shall not pretend to impose my Opinion on others with the magisterial Authority of a Critic but only take the Liberty of discovering my own Taste I shall endeavour to show our Poet's Redundance of Wit Justness of Comparisons Elegance of Descriptions and peculiar Delicacy in touching every Circumstance relating to the Passions and Affections and with the same Impartiality and Frankness I shall confess the too frequent Puerilities of his luxuriant Fancy and the too great Negligence of his sometimes unlabour'd Versification  I am not of an Opinion too common to Translators to think that One is under an Obligation to extoll every thing he finds in the Author he undertakes I am sure one is no more oblig'd to do so than a Painter is to make every Face that sits to him handsome 'Tis enough if he sets the best Features he finds in their full and most advantageous Light But if the Poet has private Deformities tho' Goodbreeding will not allow to expose him naked yet surely there can be no Reason to recommend him as the most finish'd Model of Harmony and Proportion  Whoever has this undistinguishing Complaisance will not fail to vitiate the Taste of the Readers and misguide many of them in their Judgment where to Approve and where to Censure  It must be granted that where there appears an infinite Variety of inimitable Excellencies it would be too harsh and disingenuous to be severe on such Faults as have escap'd rather thro' want of Leisure and Opportunity to correct than thro' the erroneous Turn of a deprav'd Judgment How sensible  Ovid  himself was of the Uncorrectness of the  Metamorphoses  appears from these Lines prefix'd before some of the Editions by the Care of his Commentators  Trist El vi  Orba parente suo quicunque Volumina tangis  His saltem veslrâ detur in urbe locus  Quò{que} magis saveas non sunt haec edita ab Illo  Sed quasi de domini funere rapta sui  Quicquid in his igitur vilii rude carmen habebit  Emendaturus si licuisses erat  Since therefore the Readers are not solemnly invited to an Entertainment but come accidentally they ought to be contented with what they find And pray what have they to complain of but too great Variety where tho' some of the Dishes be not serv'd in the exactest Order and Politeness but hash'd up in haste there are a great many accommodated to every particular Palate  To like every thing shows too little Delicacy and to like nothing too much Difficulty So great is the Variety of this Poem that the Reader who is never pleas'd will appear as monstrous as he that is always so Here are the Hurries of Battles for the Heroe tender Emotions of Soul for the Lover a Search and Penetration into Nature for the Philosopher Fluency of Numbers and most expressive Figures for the Poet Morals for the Serious and Plaisantries for Admirers of Points of Wit  'Tis certain a Poet is more to be suspected for saying too much than too little To add is often hazardous but to retrench commonly judicious If our Author instead of saying all he could had only said all he should  Daphne  had done well to fly from the God of Wit in order to crown his Poet Thus  Ovid  had been more honour'd and ador'd in his Exile than  Augustus  in his Triumphs  I shall now attempt to give some Instances of the Happiness and vast Extent of our Author's Imagination I shall not proceed according to the Order of the Poem but rather transcribe some Lines here and there as my Reflection shall suggest  Nec circumsuso pendebat in aere tellus  Ponderibus librata suis  Thus was the State of Nature before the Creation And here it is obvious that  Ovid  had a discerning Notion of the Gravitation of Bodies 'Tis now demonstrated that every Part of Matter tends to every Part of Matter with a Force which is always in a direct simple Proportion of the Quantity of the Matter and an inverse duplicate Proportion of the Distance which Tendency or Gravitating is constant and universal This Power whatever it be acting always proportionably to the solid Content of Bodies and never in any Proportion to their Superficies cannot be explain'd by any material Impulse For the Laws of Impulse are physically necessary There can be no  or arbitrary Principle in meer Matter its Parts cannot move unless they be mov'd and cannot do otherwise when press'd on by other Parts in Motion and therefore 'tis evident from the following Lines that  Ovid  strictly adher'd to the Opinion of the most discerning Philosophers who taught that all things were form'd by a wise and intelligent Mind  Jussit extendi campos subsidere valles  Fronde tegi sylvas  The  Fiat  of the  Hebrew  Lawgiver is not more sublime than the  Jussit  of the  Latin  Poet who goes on in the same Elevated and Philosophical Style  His super imposuit liquidum gravitate carentem  Aethera  Here the Author spreads a thin Veil of  Aether  over his Infant Creation and tho' his asserting the upper Region to be void of Gravitation may not in a Mathematical Rigour be true yet 'tis found from the Natural Enquities made since and especially from the learned Dr  Hally  's Discourse on the  Barometer  that if on the Surface of the Earth an Inch of Quicksilver in the Tube be equal to a Cylinder of Air of Foot it will be at a Mile's height equal to a Cylinder of Air of and therefore the Air at so great a Distance from the Earth must be rarify'd to so great a Degree that the Space it fills must bear a very small Proportion to that which is entirely void of Matter  I think we may be confident from what already appears as well as from what our Author has writ on the  Roman  Feasts that he cou'd not be totally ignorant of Astronomy Some of the Criticks wou'd insinuate from the following Lines that he mistook the annual Motion of the Sun for the Diurnal  Met B  Sectus in obliquum  Tho' the Sun be always in one or other of the Signs of the  Zodiack  and never goes by either Motion more Northward or Southward than is here describ'd Yet  Phaeton  being design'd to drive the Chariot but one Day ought to have been directed in the  Aequator  or a Circle Parallel to it and not round the other Oblique one of the Ecliptick a Degree of which and that by a Motion contrary to the Diurnal he was obliged to go in that length of Time  I am inclin'd to think that  Ovid  had so great an Attention to Poetical Embelishments that he voluntarily declin'd a strict Observance of any Astronomical System For tho' that Science was far from being neglected in former Ages yet the Progress which was made in it by no means equall'd that of our present Time  Lucretius  tho' in other things most penetrating describes the Sun scarce bigger than he appears to the Eye  Nec nimio solis major rota nec minor ardor  Esse potest nostris quam sensibus esse videtur  And  Homer  imagining the Seats of the Gods above the fix'd Stars represents the falling of  Vulcan  from thence to the Isle of  Lemnos  to continue during a whole Day  B    The  Greek  Poet aims here to give a surprising Idea of the height of the Celestial Mansions but if the Computation of a modern Astronomer be  true they are at so much a greater Distance that  Vulcan  wou'd have been more Years in falling than he was Minutes  But least I shou'd exceed the usual Length of a Preface I shall now give some Instances of the Propriety of our Author's Similes and Epithets the Perspicuity of his Allegories the Instructive Excellence of the Morals the peculiar happy Turn of his Fancy and shall begin with the Elegance of his Descriptions  Met B  Madidis Notus evolat alis  Terribilem piceâ tectus caligine vultum  Barba gravis nimbis canis fluit unda capillis  Fronte sedent nebulae rorant pennaeque sinusque    Sternuntur segetes deplorata coloni  Vota jacent longique labor perit irritus anni  These Lines introduce those of the Deluge which are also very Poetical and worthy to be compar'd with the next concerning the Golden Age  Sine militis usu  Mollia securae peragebant otia gentes  Ipsa quoque immunis rastroque intacta nec ullis  Saucia vomeribus per se dabat omnia tellus  Contentique cibis nullo cogente creatis  Arbuteos foetus montanaque sraga legebant  Et quae deciderant patulâ Jovis arbore glandes  Ver erat aeternum placidique tepentibus auris  Mulcebant Zephyri natos sine semine flores  Virgil  has also touch'd upon the same Subject in the end of the Second  Georgick  Aureus hanc vitam in terris Saturnus agebat  Nec dum etiam audierant inflari classica nec dum  Impositos duris crepitare incudibus enses  And again  Aen B S l  Primus ab aetherio venit Saturnus Olympo    Aurea quae perhibent illo sub rege suerunt  Saecula sic placidà populos in pace regebat  Some of the Lines a little foreign to the present Subject are omitted but I shall make the most admirable Author amends by transcribing at length his next Description 'Tis of a Stag which gave the first Occasion to the War betwixt the  Trojans  and the  Rutulians  I chuse this because my Design is to have these two great Poets seen together where the Subject happens to be almost the same tho' the Nature of the Poems be very different  Aen B l  Cervus erat sormâ praestanti cornibus ingens  Tyrreidae pueri quem matris ab ubere raptum  Nutribant Tyrrheusque pater cui regia parent  Armenta latè custodia credita campi  Assuetum imperiis soror omni Sylvia curâ  Mollibus intexens ornabat cornua sertis  Pectebatque ferum puroque in fonte lavabat  Ille manûm patiens mensaeque assuetus herili  Errabat sylvis  The Image which  Ovid  gives of the Favourite Stag slain accidentally by  Cyparissus  seems not of less Dignity  Ingens cervus erat latéque patentibus altas  Ipse suo capiti praebebat cornibus umbras  Cornua fulgebant auro demissaque in armos  Pendebant tereti gemmata monilia collo  Bulla super frontem parvis argentea loris  Vincta movebatur parilique ex aere nitebant  Auribus in geminis circum cava tempora baccae  Isque metu vacuus naturalique pavore  Deposito celebrare domos mulcendaque colla  Quamlibet ignotis manibus praebere solebat  Gratus erat Cyparisse tibi Tu pabula cervum  Ad nova tu liquidi ducebas fontis ad undam    Tu modo texebas varios per cornua flores  Nunc eques in tergo residens huc latus illuc  Mollia purpureis fraenabas ora capistris  In the following Lines  Ovid  describes the watry Court of the River  Peneus  which the Reader may compare with  Virgil  's Subterranean Grott of  Cyrene  the  Naïad  Mother to  Aristaeus  Met B r  Est nemus Haemoniae praerupta quod undique claudit  Silva vocant Tempe per quae Penëus ab imo  Effusus Pindo spumosis volvitur undis  Dejectuque gravi tenues agitantia sumos  Nubila conducit summasque aspergine sylvas  Impluit sonitu plus quam vicina fatigat  Haec domus hae sedes haec sunt penetralia magni  Amnis in hoc residens sacto de cautibus antro  Undis jura dabat Nymphisque colentibus undas  Conveniunt illuc popularia slumina primum  Nescia gratentur consolenturvé parentem  Populiser Spercheos irrequietus Enipeus  Eridanusque senex lenisque Amphrysos Aeas  Moxque amnes alii qui quà tulit impetus illes  In mare deducunt sesas erroribus undas  G B  Tristis Aristaeus Penei genitoris ad undam  Stat lacrymans    Jamque domum mirans genetricis humida regna  Speluncisque lacus clausos lucosque sonantes  Ibat ingenti motu stupefactus aquarum  Omnia sub magnâ labentia flumina terrâ  Spectabat diversa locis Phasimque Lycumque  Et caput unde altus primum se erumpit Enipeus  Unde pater Tiberinus unde Aniena fluenta  Et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu  Eridanus quo non alius per pinguia culta  In mare purpureum violentior influit amnis  The Divine Poet goes on in Pomp of Numbers and easy Magnificence of Words till he introduces the Story of  Orpheus  and  Euridice  in the Narration of which he is as much superior to  Ovid  as the Reeds of his own  Mantuan  Shepherds are less Musical than the Lyre of  Orpheus  That I may not be too long on this Article I shall recommend to the Reader  Ovid  's admirable Description of Sleep  Est prope Cimmerios    Met B  That of Hunger  Est locus extremis Scythiae    B  That of the Plague  Dira lues    B  That of Fame  Orbe locus medio est    B  Virgil  has also touch'd on the two last in the one he had  Lucretius  in View in the other  Homer  and I think it will not be to the Disadvantage of our Author to appear at the same time  There are many other Descriptions scatter'd in the  Metamorphoses  which for just Expression of Nature and Majestick Modulation of Words are only Inferior to those already transcrib'd as they are shorter which makes the Objection that his Diction is commonly loytring into Prose a great deal too severe  The  Metamorphoses  must be consider'd as is observ'd before very uncorrect and  Virgil  's Works as finish'd tho' his own Modesty wou'd not allow the  Aeneids  to be so It seems it was harder for him to please himself than his Readers His Judgment was certainly great nor was his Vivacity of Imagination less for the first without the last is too heavy and like a Dress without Fancy and the last without the first is too gay and but all Trimming  Our Author's Similitudes are next to be consider'd which are always remarkably short and convey some pleasing Idea to the Imagination 'Tis in this Branch of the Poem that he has discover'd as just a Judgement as any of the Classicks whatever Poets to give a Loose to a warm Fancy are generally too apt not only to expatiate in their Simile's but introduce them too frequently by doing the first they detain the Attention too long from the principal Narration and by the latter they make too frequent Breaches in the Unity of the Poem  Those two Errors  Ovid  has most discerningly avoided How short and significant are generally his Comparisons he fails not in these to keep a stiff Rein on a Highmettled  Pegasus  and takes care not to surfeit here as he has done on other Heads by an erroneous Abundance  His Simile's are thicker sown by much in the Fable of  Salmacis  and  Hermaphroditus  than in any other Book but always short  The Nymph clasps the Youth close to her Breast and both insensibly grow one  Met B  Velut si quis conducto cortice ramos  Crescendo jungi pariterque adolescere cernat  Again as  Atlanta  reddens in the Race with  H  ppomenes    Met B  Inque puellari corpus candore ruborem  Traxerat haud aliter quam cum super atria velum  Candida purpureum simulatas inficit umbras  Philomela  's Tongue seem'd to move after it was cut out by  Tereus  B  Utque salire solet mutilatae cauda colubrae  Palpitat  Cadmus  sows the Dragons Teeth and the Sons of the Earth rise gradually  B  Inde fide majus glebae cepêre moveri  Primaque de sulcis acies apparuit hastae  Tegmina mox capitum picto nutantia cono  Mox humeri pectusque  Sic ubi tolluntur festis aulaea theatris  Surgere signa solent primumque ostendere vultum  Caetera paulatim placidoque educta tenore  Tota patent imoque pedes in margine ponunt  The Objection to  Ovid  that he never knows when to give over is too manifest Tho' he frequently expatiates on the same Thought in different Words yet in his Simile's that Exuberance is avoided There is in them all a Simplicity and a Confinement to the present Object always a Fecundity of Fancy but rarely an Intemperance nor do I remember he has err'd above once by an illjudg'd Superfluity After he has describ'd the Labyrinth built by  Daedalus  he compares it thus  B  Non secus ac liquidus Phrygiis Maenandros in arvis  Ludit ambiguo lapsu refluitque sluitque  Et nunc ad sontes nunc ad mare versus apertum  Incertas exercet aquas  He should have ended at the close of the Second Line as  Virgil  should have done at the end of the Fourth in his noble Similè where  Dido  proceeds to the Temple with her Court about her  Aen B  Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per juga Cynthi  Exercet Diana choros quam mille secutae  Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Orëades illa pharetram  Fert humero gradiensque deas supereminet omnes  Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus  I see no Reason for the last Line Tho' the Poet be justly celebrated for a most consummate Judgment yet by an Endeavour to imitate  Homer  's Simile's he is not only very long but by introducing several Circumstances he fails of an applicable Relation betwixt the principal Subject and his new Ideas He sometimes thinks fit to work into the Piece some differing Embroidery which tho' very rich yet makes at best but glorious Patchwork I really believe his excellent Poem had not been the less so if in this Article he had thought fit to have walk'd on in his own regular and Majestick Grace rather than have been hurry'd forward through broken Byways by his blind Guide  I shall transcribe one of his Simile's which is not cull'd out but exactly of the same Texture with all the rest in the four last Books of the  Aeneids  Turnus  leaps in Fury from his Chariot  Aen B L  Ac veluti montis saxum de vertice praeceps  Cum ruit avulsum vento seu turbidus imber  Proluit aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas  Fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu  Exultatque solo sylvas armenta virosque  Involvens secum  It does not seem to be at all Material whether the Rock was blown or wash'd down by Wind or Rain or undermin'd by Time  But to return to  Ovid  the Reader may take Notice how unforc'd his Compliments and how natural his Transitions generally are With how much Ease does he slide into some new Circumstance without any Violation of the Unity of the Story The Texture is so artful that it may be compar'd to the Work of his own  Arachne  where the Shade dyes so gradually and the Light revives so imperceptibly that it is hard to tell where the one ceases and the other begins  When he is going off from the Story of  Apollo  and  Daphne  how happily does he introduce a Compliment to the  Roman  Conquerors  Met B  Et conjux quoniam mea non potes esse  Arbor eris certè  Tu Ducibus laetis aderis cum laeta triumphum  Vox canet longae visent Capitolia pompae  Postibus Augustis eadem fidissima custos  Ante sores stabis mediamque tuebere quercum  He compliments  Augustus  upon the Assassination of  Julius  and by way of Similè takes the Opportunity from the Horror that the Barbarity of  Lycaon  gave  Sic cum manus impia saevit  Sanguine Caesareo Romanum extinguere nomen c  Julius  is deify'd and looks down on his adopted Son  B  Natique videns benesacta fatetur  Esse suis majora vinci gaudet ab illo  And immediately follows  Hic sua praeferri quanquam vetat acta paternis  Libera fama tamen nullisque obnoxia jussis  Invitum praefert  The Author in the two first Lines shows the Affectionate Condescention of the Father in the three last the pious Gratitude of the Son  The Compliments to  Augustus  are very frequent in the last Book of the  Metamorphoses  as those to the same Emperor are in the  Georgicks  of  Virgil  which also strike the Imagination by their agreeable Flattery  G  Haec super arvorum cultu pecorumque canebam  Et super arboribus Caesar dum magnus ad altum  Fulminat Euphratem bello victorque volentes  Per populos dat jura viamque affectat Olympo  Again on  Julius    Aen B  Imperium Oceano famam qui terminet astris  Julius  The Compliments have a great Sublimity and worthy of the Grandeur of the Heroes and the Wit of the Poet  Ovid  as much deserves Praise for saying a great deal in a little as Censure for saying a little in a great deal None of the Classick Poets had the Talent of expressing himself with more Force and Perspicuity  Phaeton  desires some Pledge of his Father's Tenderness and asks to be trusted with his Chariot He answers  B  Pignora certa petis do pignora certa timendo  However the latter complies with his Importunity the Consequence is fatal the World is set on Fire even the Rivers feel the force of the Conflagration The  Tagus  boyls  Fluit ignibus Aurum  The  Nile  retreats  Occuluit que caput quod adhuc latet  Zanthus  is parch'd up  Arsurusque iterum Zanthus  The Poet's Fancy is here full of Energy as well as in the following Lines  Apollo  courts  Daphne  and promises himself Success but is disappointed  Quodque cupit sperat suaque illum Oracula sallunt  And again  The River  Achelous  combats  Hercules  and assumes several Shapes in vain then puts on at last that of a Snake the Heroe smiles in Contempt  Cunarum labor est angues superare mearum  Ovid  never excells himself so much as when he takes Occasion to touch upon the Passion of Love all Hearts are in a manner sensible of the same Emotions and like Instruments tun'd Unisons if a String of any one of them be struck the rest by consent vibrate  Procris  is jealous of  Cephalus  she endeavours to be confirm'd in her Fears but hopes the contrary  Speratque miserrima falli  The next is not less Natural  Sed cuncta timemus amantes  Biblis  is in love with  Caunus  The Struggle is betwixt her unlawful Flame and her Honour  She's all Confusion at the Thoughts of discovering her Passion  miserere fatentis amorem  She attempts to write  Incipit dubitat scribit damnatque tabellas  Et notat delet mutat culpatque probatque  In the End Inclination as it does always gets the better of Discretion  This last Fable shows how touchingly the Poet argues in Love Affairs as well as those of  Medea  and  Scylla  The two last are left by their Heroes and their Reflections are very Natural and Affecting  Ovid  seem'd here to have had  Virgil  's Passion of  Dido  in his Eye but with this difference the one had convers'd much with Ladies and knew they lov'd to talk a great deal The other consider'd no less what was natural for them to say than what became them to say  Virgil  has through the whole Management of this Rencounter discover'd a most finish'd Judgment  Aeneas  like other Men likes for Convenience and leaves for greater  Dido  like other Ladies resents the Neglect enumerates the Obligations the Lover is under upbraids him with Ingratitude threatens him with Revenge then by and by submits begs for Compassion and has recourse to Tears  It appears from this Piece that  Virgil  was a discerning Master in the Passion of Love And they that consider the Spirit and Turn of that inimitable Line  Qui Bavium non odit  cannot doubt but he had an equal Talent for Satyr  Nor does the Genius of  Ovid  more exert on the Subject of Love than on all others In the Contention of  Ajax    Ulysses  his Elocution is most nervous and perswading Where he endeavours to disswade Mankind from indulging carnivorous Appetites in his Pythagorean Philosophy how emphatical is his Reasoning  B  Quid meruêre hoves animal sine srande dolisque  Innocuum simplex natum tolerare laborem  Immemor est demum nec srugum munere dignus  Qui potuit curvi dempto modò pondere aratri  Ruricolam mactare suum  I think  Agricolam  had been stronger but the Authority of Manuscripts does not warrant that Emendation  Through the whole Texture of this Work  Ovid  discovers the highest Humanity and a most exceeding good Nature The Virtuous in Distress are always his Concern and his Wit contrives to give them an Immortality with himself  He seems to have taken the most Pains in the first and second Book of the  Metamorphoses  tho' the Thirteenth abounds with Sentiments most moving and with calamitous Incidents introduc'd with great Art The Poet had here in View the Tragedy of  Hecuba  in  Euripides  and 'tis a wonder it has never been attempted in our own Tongue The House of  Priam  is destroy'd his Royal Daughter a Sacrifice to the  Manes  of him that occasion'd it She is forc'd from the Arms of her unhappy Friends and hurryd to the Altar where she behaves herself with a Decency becoming her Sex and a Magnanimity equal to her Blood and so very affecting that even the Priest wept  Ipse etiam flens invitusque sacerdos c  She shows no Concern at approaching Death but on the Account of her old unfortunate Mother  Mors tantum vellem matrem mea fallere possit  Mater obest minuitque necis mea gaudia quamvis  Non mea mors illi verum sua vita gemenda est  Then begs her Body may be deliver'd to her without Ransom  Genetrici corpus inemptum  Reddite néve auro redimat jus triste sepulchri  Sed lacrymis tunc cum poterat redimebat auro  The unhappy Queen laments she is not able to give her Daughter royal Burial  Non haec est fortuna domûs  Then takes the Body in her decrepid Arms and halts to the Sea to wash off the Blood  Ad littus passu processit anili  Albentes laniata comas  The animated Thoughts and lively Images of this Poem are numerous None ever painted more to the Life than our Author tho' several Grotesque Figures are now and then seen in the same Groupe The most plentiful Season that gives Birth to the finest Flowers produces also the rankest Weeds  Ovid  has shown in one Line the brightest Fancy sometimes and in the next the poorest Affectation  Venus  makes Court to  Adonis    B l  Et ecce  Opportuna suâ blanditur Populus umbrâ  Et requievit humo pressitque gramen ipsum  Phoebus  requests  Phaeton  to desist from his Request  Consiliis non curribus utere nostris  Caeneus  in the Battle of the  Centaurs  wounds  Latreus  in several Places  Vulnusque in vulnere fecit  These are some of our Poet's Boyisms There is another Affectation call'd by  Quintil  or a witty Folly which wou'd not have appear'd quite so trifling had it been less frequent  Medea  persuades the Daughters of  Pelias  to kill their Father in order to have his Youth renew'd She that loves him best gives the first Wound  B  Et ne sit scelerata facit scelus  Althea  is enrag'd at her Son  Meleager  and to do Justice to the  Manes  of his Brothers destroys him  Impietate pia est  Envy enters  Athens  and beholds the flourishing Condition of the City  Vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile cernit  Ovid  was much too fond of such Witticisms which are more to be wonder'd at because they were not the Fashion of that Age as Punns and Quibbles are of this  Virgil  as I remember is not found trifling in this Manner above once or twice  Deucalion vacuum lapides jactavit in orbem  Unde homines nati durum genus  Juno  is in Indignation at  Aeneas  upon his Arrival in  Italy  Num capti potuere capi num incensa cremavit  Troja viros  The Poet is so far from Affecting this sort of Wit that he rarely ventures on so spirited a Turn of Fancy as in these following Instances  Juno  upbraids  Venus  and  Cupid  Ironically that two Deities cou'd be able to get the better of one weak Woman  Memorabile nomen  Una dolo Divûm si saemina victa duorum est  Euryalus  going upon an Enterprise expresses his Concern for his surviving Mother if he shou'd fall and recommends her to the Care of  Ascanius  who Answers  Namque erit ista mihi genitrix nomenque Creûsae  Solum desuerit  Venus  is importunate in her Sollicitations to  Vulcan  to make Armour  her Son He Answers  Absiste precando  Viribus indubitare tuis  At the first kindling of  Dido  's Passion he has this most natural Thought  Illum absens absentem auditque videtque  But to return to  Ovid  tho' I cannot vindicate him for his Points I shall endeavour to mollify his Criticks when they give him no quarter for his Diction and attack him so inflexibly for ending his Lines with Monosyllables as  si quissi non    c  and as I think he cannot be excus'd more advantagiously than by affirming that where he has done it once  Virgil  has twenty times  Et cum    Si quis    Nec dum      Si quam    Si quis      Jam bos    Nunc nunc    c  G G G Aen Aen Aen  There are a great many Endings of Lines in this manner and more indeed than seems consistent with the Majesty of Heroick Verse When Lines are design'd to be  sermoni propiores  this Liberty may be allowable but not so when the Subject requires more sonorous Numbers  Virgil  seems to endeavour to keep up his Versification to an Harmonious Dignity and therefore when fit Words do not offer with some  ase he'll rather break off in an Hemistick than that the Line shou'd be lazy and languid He well knew how essential it was in Poetry to flatter the Ear and at the same time was sensible that this Organ grows tir'd by a constant Attention to the same Harmony and therefore he endeavour'd now and then to relieve it by a Cadence of Pauses and a Variation of Measures  Ecl  Amphion Dircaeus in Actaeo Aracyntho  This Line seems not tuneful at the first hearing but by Repetition it reconciles it self and has the same Effect with some Compositions of Musick which are at the first Performance tiresome and afterward Entertaining  The Commentators and Criticks are of Opinion that whenever  Virgil  is less Musical it is where he endeavours at an Agreement of the Sound with the Sense as  Procumbit humi bos  It wou'd show as much Singularity to deny this as it does a fanciful Facility to affirm it because it is obvious in many Places he had no such view  Aen l  Inventa sub ilicibus sus  G l  Dentesque sabellicus exacuit sus  Aen l  Jam setis obsita jam bos  Aen l  Furor additus inde Lupi ceu c  The Places which favour most the first Opinion are  G l  Saxa per scopulos depressas convalles  G  Sepe exiguus mus  Omnia sub magnâ labentia flumina terrâ  The last Line is the only Instance I remember except one in  Ecl  where the Words terminate in the same Vowel and seem to represent the constant and uniform sound of a sliding Stream  Those that are most conversant in Classick Poetry must be sensible that  Virgil  has been much more solicitous than  Ovid  to keep up his Lines to an easy and a Musical Flow but tho' the Criticks charge the latter with breaking through  Prosody  and  Grammar  and allowing himself too often the Licence of Graecisms I take this Censure to be only an arrogant Pedantry in the Grammarians and groundless in it self but tho' it were true I dare be confident it is full as just upon  Virgil    Ec l  Curru subjungere

that tho' there be several short Vowels made long in  Homer  yet there is no Instance on the contrary of a long Vowel such as the first Syllable of    and the like made short except in such a Case as that I have cited where the next Word begins with a Vowel which shows that there is no such thing as a  Poetica licentia  properly so call'd  Certainly no body can imagine but these two celebrated Authors understood their own Tongue better than the scrupulous Grammarians of Afterages who are too Dogmatical and Selfsufficient when they presume to censure Either of them for not attending strictly enough to Syntax and the Measure of Verse The  Latin  Tongue is a dead Language and none can decide with Confidence on the Harmony or Disonance of the Numbers of these Times unless they were thoroughly acquainted with their Pauses and Cadence They may indeed pronounce with much more Assurance on their Diction and distinguish where they have been negligent and where more finish'd There are certainly many Lines in  Ovid  where he has been downright Lazy and where he might have avoided the Appearance of being obviously so by a very little application In recording the Succession of the  Alban  Kings thus  Epitus ex illo est post hunc Capetusque Capysque  Sed Capys ante suit  There are also several Lines in  Virgil  which are not altogether tunable to a modern Ear and which appear unfinish'd  G l  Scilicet omnibus est labor impendendus omnes  Cogendae in sulcum  G l  Praesertim si tempestas a vertice sylvis  Incubuit  Aen l  Quasve referre parem sed nunc est omnia quando  Iste animus supra  Aen l  Ista quidem quia nota mihi tua magne voluntas  Jupiter  But the Sun has its Spots and if amongst Thousands of inimitable Lines there shou'd be some found of an unequal Dignity with the rest nothing can be said for their Vindication more than if they be Faults they are the Faults of  Virgil  As I ought to be on this Occasion an Advocate for  Ovid  whom I think is too much run down at present by the critical Spirit of this Nation I dare say I cannot be more effectually so than by comparing him in many Places with his admir'd Contemporary  Virgil  and tho' the last certainly deserves the Palm I shall make use of  Ovid  's own Lines in the tryal of Strength betwixt  Achelous  and  Hercules  to show how much he is honour'd by the Contention  Met B  Non tam  Turpe fuit vinci quam contendisse decorum  I shall finish my Remarks on our Author by taking Notice of the Justness and Perspicuity of his Allegories which are either Physical or Natural Moral or Historical Of the first Kind is the Fable of  Apollo  and  Python  in the Explanation of this all the  Mythologists  agree Exhalations and Mists being the constant Effects of Inundations are here dissipated by the Rays of the Sun  Of the Second Kind are  Acteon  torn to Pieces by his own Pack of Dogs and  Erisicthon  starv'd by the Disease of Hunger These two Allegories seem to signify that Extravagance and Luxury end in Want  Of the Third is the Story of the Rape of  Europa  History says she was Daughter to  Agenor  and carry'd by the  Candians  in a Gally bearing a Bull in the Stern in order to be marry'd to one of their Kings nam'd  Jupiter  This Explanation gives an Occasion for a Digression which is not altogether foreign to the present purpose because it will be of Use to justify  Ovid  on some other Occasions where he is censur'd for being too free with the Characters of the Gods I was once representing the  Metamorphoses  as an excellent System of Morality but an illustrious Lady whose least Advantage above her Sex is that of being one of the greatest Princesses in  Europe  objected that the loose and immodest Sallys of  Jupiter  did by no means confirm my Assertion  One must consider that what appear'd an Absurdity in  Ovid  is not so much his own Fault as that of the Times before him The Characters of the Gods of the old Heroick Age represented them unjust in their Actions mutable in their Designs partial in their Favours ignorant of Events scurrilous in their Language Some of the superior Hierarchy treating one another  with injurious Brutalities and are often guilty of such Indecencies and Misbehaviour as the lowest of Mortals would blush to own  Juno  calls  Diana  the Goddess of Chastity  Brazenfac'd Bitch  Hom Il B l  Jupiter  insults his Daughter the Goddess of Wisdom for Rashness and Folly bids  Iris  tell her he'll maul her CoachHorses for her like a surly Bitch as she is    Il B S  from  I  to  I  then threatens in another Place to beat his Wife that divinc Vixon the immortal Partner of the Empyreal Throne    Il B l  The Commentators may endeavour to hide those Absurdities under the Veil of Allegories but the Reader that considers the whole Texture of the  Iliad  will find that the Author's Meaning and their Interpretation are often as unlike as the imaginary Heroes of his time are to the real ones of Ours  Allegories should be obvious and not like Meteors in the Air which represent a different Figure to every different Eye Now they are Armies of Soldiers now Flocks of Sheep and by and by nothing  Perhaps the Criticks of a more exalted Taste may discover such Beauties in the antient Poetry as may escape the Comprehension of us Pigmies of a more limited Genius They may be able to fathom the Divine Sense of the Pagan Theology whist we aim at no more than to judge of a little common Sense  It is and ever will be a Rule to a great many to applaud and condemn with the general Vogue tho' never so ill grounded The most are affraid of being Particular and rather than strive against the Stream are proud of being in the wrong with the Many rather than desirous of being in the right with the Few and tho' they be convinc'd of the Reasonableness of dissenting from the common Cry yet out of a poor fear of Censure they contribute to establish it and thus become an Authority against others who in reality are but of their own Opinion  Ovid  was so far from paying a blind deference to the venerable Name of his  Grecian  Predecessor in the Character of his Gods that when  Jupiter  punishes  Andromeda  for the Crimes of her Mother he calls him  injustus Ammon    Met B  and takes commonly an honourable care of the Decorum of the Godhead when their Actions are consistent with the Divinity of their Character His Allegories include some Religious or instructive Moral wrap'd up in a peculiar Perspicuity The Fable of  Proserpina  being sometimes in Hell and sometimes with  Ceres  her Mother can scarce mean any thing else than the sowing and coming up of Corn The various Dresses that  Vertumnus  the God of Seasons puts on in his Courtship of  Pomona  the Garden Goddess seem plainly to express the different and most proper times for Digging Planting Pruning and gathering the Increase I shall be shorter on this Head because our Countryman Mr  Sands  has by a laborious Search amongst the Mythologists been very full He has annex'd his Explanations to the end of each Book which deserve to be recommended to those that are Curious in this figurative Learning  The Reader cannot fail of observing how many excellent Lessons of Morality  Ovid  has given us in the course of his Fables  The Story of  Deucalion  and  Pyrrba  teaches that Piety and Innocence cannot miss of the divine Protection and that the only Loss irreparable is that of our Probity and Justice  That of  Phaeton  how the too great tenderness of the Parent proves a cruelty to the Child and that he who wou'd climb to the Seat of  Jupiter  generally meets with his Bolt by the way  The Tale of  Baucis  and  Philemon  is most inimitably told He omits not the minutest Circumstance of a Cottage Life and is much fuller than  Virgil  where he brings in his contented old Man  Corycius  G  Ovid  represents a good old Couple happy and satisfy'd in a cleanly Poverty hospitable and free of the few things that Fortune had given them moderate in Desires affectionate in their conjugal Relation so religious in Life that when they observ'd their homely Cabbin rising to a Temple all the Bounty they ask'd of the Gods they had entertain'd was that they might do the Office of Priesthood there and at their Death not survive one another  The Stories of  Lycaon  and  Pentheus  not only deter from Infidelity and Irreverence to the Gods but the last also shows that too great Zeal produces the same Effects as none at all and that Enthusiasm is often more cruel than Atheism  The Story of  Minos  and  Scylla  represents the Infamy of selling our Country and teaches that even they who love the Crime abhor the Criminal  In  Cippus  we find a noble Magnanimity and Heavenly Selfdenial he prefer'd the Good of the Republick to his own private Grandeur and chose with an exemplary Generosity rather to live a private FreeMan out of  Rome  than to command Numbers of Slaves in it  From the Story of  Hercules  we learn that Glory is a Lady who like many others loves to have her Admirers suffer a great deal for her The Poet enumerates the Labours of the Heroe shows how he conquer'd every thing for Others but nothing for himself Then does him the Poetical Justice of an Apotheosis thinking it most fit that one who had born the Celestial Orbs on his Shoulders shou'd have a Mansion amongst them  From the Assumption of  Romulus  that when War is at an end the chief Business of Peace should be the enacting good Laws that after a People are preserv'd from the Enemy the next care shou'd be to preserve them from themselves and therefore the best Legislators deserve a Place amongst Heroes and Deities  From  Ariadne  being inhumanly deserted by  Theseus  and generously receiv'd by  Bacchus  we find that as there is nothing we can be sure of so there is nothing we ought to despair of  From  Althea  burning the Brand that we shou'd take care least under the Notion of Justice we shou'd do a Cruelty for they that are set upon Revenge only endeavour to imitate the Injury  From  Polyphemus  making Love to  Galatea  one may observe that the most deform'd can find something to like in thier own Person He examines his Face in the Stream combs his ruful Locks with a Rake grows more exact and studious of his Dress and discovers the first Sign of being in Love by endeavouring at a more than usual Care to please  The Fable of  Cephalus  and  Procrys  confirms that every Trifle contributes to heighten the Disease of Jealousy and that the most convincing Proofs can scarce cure it  From that of  Hippomenes  and  Atalanta  we may discover that a generous Present helps to persuade as well as an agreeable Person  From  Medea  's flying from  Pelias  's Court that the offer'd Favours of the Impious should be always suspected and that they who design to make every one fear them are afraid of every one  From  Myrrha  that Shame is sometimes hard to be overcome but if the Sex once gets the better of it it gives them afterwards no more Trouble  From  Cenis  that Effeminacy in Youth may change to Valour in Manhood and that as Fame perishes so does Censure  From  Tereus  that one Crime lays the Foundation of many and that the same Person who begins with Lust may conclude with Murther  From  Midas  that no Body can punish a Covetous Man worse than he punishes himself that scarce any thing wou'd sometimes prove more fatal to us than the Completion of our own Wishes and that he who has the most Desires will certainly meet with the most Disappointments  From the  Pythagorean  Philosophy it may be observ'd that Man is the only Animal who kills his FellowCreature without being angry  From  Proteus  we have this Lesson that a Statesman can put on any Shape can be a Spaniel to the Lyon and a Lyon to the Spaniel and that he knows not to be an Enemy who knows not how to seem a Friend that if all Crowns shou'd change their Ministry as often as they please tho' they may be call'd other Ministers they are still the same Men  The Legend of  Aesculapiu  's Voyage to  Rome  in form of a Snake seems to express the necessary Sagacity requir'd in Professors of that Art for the readier Insight into Distempers This Reptile being celebrated by the ancient Naturalists for a quick Sight  Hor Sat L  Cur in amicorum vitium tam cernis acutum  Quam aut aquilae aut serpens Epidaurius  The venerable  Epidaurian  assum'd the figure of an Animal without Hands to take Fees and therefore grateful Posterity honour'd him with a Temple In this manner shou'd wealthy Physitians upon proper Occasions practise and thus their surviving Patients reward  If the  Metamorphoses  be attended to with a just Application and without Prepossession One will be the less surpriz'd at the Author's Prophetick Spirit relating to the Duration and Success of the Work  Jamque opus exegi c  This Prediction has so far prov'd true that this Poem has been ever since the Magazine which has furnish'd the greatest Poets of the following Ages with Fancy and Allusions and the most celebrated Painters with Subjects and Designs Nor has his Poetical Predecessors and Contemporaries paid less Regard to their own Performances  Luer B  Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam  Unde prius nulli velârint tempora Musae  Enn Frag  Nemo me lacrumeis decoret nec sunera sletu  Facsit quur volito viv  per ora

monumentum aere perennius  Regalique situ Pyramidum altius  Quod non imber edax non Aquilo impotens  Possit diruere aut innumerabilis  Annorum series fuga temporum  Non omnis moriar  The whole Ode is in a manner a continu'd Compliment to his own Writings nor in Imitation of this celebrated Author want we Poets of our present Age who have been pleas'd to rank themselves amongst their own Admirers  I have done with the Original and shall make no Excuse for the length of the Preface because it is in the power of the Reader to make is as short as he pleases I shall now conclude with a Word or two about the Version  Translation is commonly either Verbal or Paraphrase or Imitation of the first sort is Mr  Sands  's which I think the  Metamorphoses  can by no means allow of It is agreed the Author left it unfinish'd if it had undergone his last Hand it is more than probable that many Superfluities had been retrench'd Where a Poem is perfectly finish'd the Translation with regard to particular Idioms cannot be too exact by doing this the Sense of the Author is more entirely his own and the Cast of the Periods more faithfully preserv'd But where a Poem is tedious through Exuberance or dark through a hasty Brevity I think the Translator may be excus'd for doing what the Author upon revising wou'd have done himself  If Mr  Sands  had been of this Opinion perhaps other Translations of the  Metamorphoses  had not been attempted  A Critick has observ'd that in his Version of this Book he has scrupulously confin'd the Number of his Lines to those of the Original 'Tis fit I should take the Summ upon Content and be better bred than to count after him  The Manner that seems most suited for this present Undertaking is neither to follow the Author too close out of a Critical Timorousness nor abandon him too wantonly through a Poetick Boldness The Original should always be kept in View without too apparent a Deviation from the Sense Where it is otherwise it is not a Version but an Imitation The Translator ought to be as intent to keep up the Gracefulness of the Poem as artful to hide its Imperfections to copy its Beauties and to throw a Shade over its Blemishes to be faithful to an Idolatry where the Author excells and to take the Licence of a little Paraphrase where Penury of Fancy or Dryness of Expression seem to ask for it  The Ingenious Gentlemen concern'd in this Undertaking seem to be of this Opinion and therefore they have not only consulted the Reputation of the Author but their own also There is one of them has no other Share in this Compliment than by being the Occasion of engaging them that have in obliging the Publick He has also so just to the Memory  and Reputation of Mr  Dryden  as to give his incomparable Lines the Advantage of appearing so near his Own  I cannot pass by that Admirable  English  Poet without endeavouring to make his Country sensible of the Obligations they have to his Muse Whether they consider the flowing Grace of his Versification the vigorous Sallies of his Fancy or the peculiar Delicacy of his Periods they'll discover Excellencies never to be enough admir'd If they trace him from the first Productions of his Youth to the last Performances of his Age they'll find that as the Tyranny of Rhyme never impos'd on the Perspicuity of the Sense so a languid Sense never wanted to be set off by the Harmony of Rhyme And as his earlier Works wanted no Maturity so his latter wanted no Force or Spirit The falling off of his Hair had no other Consequence than to make his Lawrels be seen the more  As a Translator he was just as an Inventer he was rich His Versions of some parts of  Lucretius    Horace    Homer  and  Virgil  throughout gave him a just pretence to that Compliment which was made to  Monsieur d'Ablancourt  a celebrated  French  Translater  It is uncertain who have the greatest Obligations to Him the Dead or the Living  With all these wondrous Talents He was Libell'd in his Lifetime by the very Men who had no other Excellencies but as they were his Imitators Where he was allow'd to have Sentiments superior to all others they charged him with Theft But how did he Steal no otherwise than like those that steal Beggars Children only to cloath them the better  'Tis to be lamented that Gentlemen still continue this unfair Behaviour and treat one another every Day with most injurious Libels The Muses should be Ladies of a chaste and fair Behaviour when they are otherwise they are Furies 'Tis certain that  Parnassus  is at best but a barren Mountain and its Inhabitants contrive to make it more so by their unneighbourly Deportment the Authors are the only Corporation that endeavour at the Ruin of their own Society Every Day may convince them how much a rich Fool is respected above a poor Wit The only Talents in Esteem at present are those of  ExchangeAlly  one Tally is worth a Grove of Bays and 'tis of much more Consequence to be well read in the Tables of Interest and the Rise and Fall of Stocks than in the Revolution of Empires  Mr  Dryden  is still a sad and shameful Instance of this Truth The Man that cou'd make Kings immortal and raise triumphant Arches to Heroes now wants a poor square Foot of Stone to show where the Ashes of one of the greatest Poets that ever was upon Earth are deposited  CONTENTS  BOOK the FIRST  By Mr DRYDEN

my Numbers with Coelestial Heat  Till I my long laborious Work compleat  And add perpetual Tenour to my Rhimes  Deduc'd from Nature's Birth to  Caesar  's Times  Before the Seas and this Terrestrial Ball  And Heav'ns high Canopy that covers all  One was the Face of Nature if a Face  Rather a rude and indigested Mass  A lifeless Lump unfashion'd and unfram'd  Of jarring Seeds and justly  Chaos  nam'd  No Sun was lighted up the World to view  No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew  Nor yet was Earth suspended in the Sky  Nor pois'd did on her own Foundations lye  Nor Seas about the Shoars their Arms had thrown  But Earth and Air and Water were in one  Thus Air was void of Light and Earth unstable  And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable  No certain Form on any was imprest  All were confus'd and each disturb'd the rest  For hot and cold were in one Body fixt  And soft with hard and light with heavy mixt  But God or Nature while they thus contend  To these intestine Discords put an end  Then Earth from Air and Seas from Earth were driv'n  And grosser Air sunk from Aetherial Heav'n  Thus disembroil'd they take their proper place  The next of kin contiguously embrace  And foes are sunder'd by a larger space  The force of Fire ascended first on high  And took its dwelling in the vaulted Sky  Then Air succeeds in Lightness next to Fire  Whose Atoms from unactive Earth retire  Earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng  Of pondrous thick unwieldy Seeds along  About her Coasts unruly Waters roar  And rising on a ridge insult the Shoar  Thus when the God whatever God was he  Had form'd the whole and made the parts agree  That no unequal Portions might be found  He moulded Earth into a spacious Round  Then with a breath he gave the Winds to blow  And bad the congregated Waters flow  He adds the running Springs and standing Lakes  And bounding Banks for winding Rivers makes  Some part in Earth are swallow'd up the most  In ample Oceans disembogu'd are lost  He shades the Woods the Vallies he restrains  With Rocky Mountains and extends the Plains  And as five Zones th' Aetherial Regions bind  Five Correspondent are to Earth assign'd  The Sun with Rays directly darting down  Fires all beneath and fries the middle Zone  The two beneath the distant Poles complain  Of endless Winter and perpetual Rain  Betwixt th' extreams two happier Climates hold  The Temper that partakes of Hot and Cold  The Fields of liquid Air inclosing all  Surround the Compass of this Earthly Ball  The lighter parts lye next the Fires above  The grosser near the watry Surface move  Thick Clouds are spread and Storms engender there  And Thunder's Voice which wretched Mortals fear  And Winds that on their Wings cold Winter bear  Nor were those blustring Brethren left at large  On Seas and Shoars their fury to discharge  Bound as they are and circumscrib'd in place  They rend the World resistless where they pass  And mighty marks of mischief leave behind  Such is the Rage of their tempestuous kind  First  Eurus  to the rising Morn is sent  The Regions of the balmy Continent  And  Eastern  Realms where early  Persians  run  To greet the blest appearance of the Sun  Westward  the wanton  Zephyr  wings his flight  Pleas'd with the remnants of departing light  Fierce  Borcas  with his Offspring issues forth  T' invade the frozen Waggon of the  North  While frowning  Auster  seeks the  Southern  Sphere  And rots with endless Rain th' unwholsom Year  High o'er the Clouds and empty Realms of Wind  The God a clearer space for Heav'n design'd  Where Fields of Light and liquid Aether flow  Purg'd from the pondrous dregs of Earth below  Scarce had the Pow'r distinguish'd these when streight  The Stars no longer overlaid with weight  Exert their Heads from underneath the Mass  And upward shoot and kindle as they pass  And with diffusive Light adorn their heav'nly place  Then every void of Nature to supply  With forms of Gods he fills the vacant Sky  New Herds of Beasts he sends the Plains to share  New Colonies of Birds to people Air  And to their Oozy Beds the finny Fish repair  A Creature of a more exalted Kind  Was wanting yet and then was Man design'd  Conscious of Thought of more capacious Breast  For Empire form'd and fit to rule the rest  Whether with particles of heavenly Fire  The God of Nature did his Soul inspire  Or Earth but new divided from the Sky  And pliant still retain'd th' Aetherial Energy  Which wise  Prometheus  temper'd into paste  And mixt with living Streams the Godlike Image cast  Thus while the mute Creation downward bend  Their Sight and to their Earthy Mother tend  Man looks aloft and with erected Eyes  Beholds his own hereditary Skies  From such rude Principles our Form began  And Earth was Metamorphos'd into Man  The GOLDEN AGE  The Golden Age was first when Man yet New  No Rule but uncorrupted Reason knew  And with a Native bent did Good pursue  Unforc'd by Punishment unaw'd by Fear  His Words were simple and his Soul sincere  Needless was written Law where none opprest  The Law of Man was written in his Breast  No suppliant Crowds before the Judge appear'd  No Court erected yet nor Cause was heard  But all was safe for Conscience was their Guard  The MountainTrees in distant prospect please  E'er yet the Pine descended to the Seas  E'er Sails were spread new Oceans to explore  And happy Mortals unconcern'd for more  Confin'd their Wishes to their Native Shoar  No Walls were yet nor Fence nor Mote nor Mound  Nor Drum was heard nor Trumpet's angry sound  Nor Swords were forg'd but void of Care and Crime  The soft Creation slept away their time  The teeming Earth yet guiltless of the Plough  And unprovok'd did fruitful Stores allow  Content with Food which Nature freely bred  On Wildings and on Strawberries they fed  Cornels and Brambleberries gave the rest  And falling Acorns furnisht out a Feast  The Flow'rs unsown in Fields and Meadows reign'd  And  Western  Winds immortal Spring maintain'd  In following Years the bearded Corn ensu'd  From Earth unask'd nor was that Earth renew'd  From Veins of Vallies Milk and Nectar broke  And Honey sweating through the pores of Oak  The SILVER AGE  But when Good  Saturn  banish'd from above  Was driven to Hell the World was under  Jove  Succeeding times a Silver Age behold  Excelling Brass but more excell'd by Gold  Then Summer Autumn Winter did appear  And Spring was but a Season of the Year  The Sun his Annual Course obliquely made  Good days contracted and enlarg'd the bad  Then Air with sultry heats began to glow  The wings of Winds were clogg'd with Ice and Snow  And shivering Mortals into Houses driv'n  Sought shelter from th' inclemency of Heav'n  Those Houses then were Caves or homely Sheds  With twining Oziers fenc'd and Moss their Beds  Then Ploughs for Seed the fruitful Furrows broke  And Oxen labour'd first beneath the Yoke  The BRAZEN AGE  To this came next in course the Brazen Age  A Warlike Offspring prompt to Bloody Rage  Not Impious yet  The IRON AGE  Hard Steel succeeded then  And stubborn as the Mettal were the Men  Truth Modesty and Shame the World forsook  Fraud Avarice and Force their places took  Then Sails were spread to every Wind that blew  Raw were the Sailors and the Depths were new  Trees rudely hollow'd did the Waves sustain  E'er Ships in Triumph plough'd the watry Plain  Then Landmarks limited to each his Right  For all before was common as the Light  Nor was the Ground alone requir'd to bear  Her annual Income to the crooked Share  But greedy Mortals rummaging her Store  Digg'd from her Entrails first the precious Oar  Which next to Hell the prudent Gods had laid  And that alluring Ill to sight displaid  Thus cursed Steel and more accursed Gold  Gave mischief Birth and made that mischief bold  And double Death did wretched Man invade  By Steel assaulted and by Gold betray'd  Now brandish'd Weapons glittering in their Hands  Mankind is broken loose from moral Bands  No rights of Hospitality remain  The Guest by him who harbour'd him is slain  The Son in Law pursues the Father's Life  The Wife her Husband murders he the Wife  The Stepdame Poyson for the Son prepares  The Son inquires into his Father's years  Faith flies and Piety in Exile mourns  And Justice here opprest to Heav'n returns  The GYANTS WAR  Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above  Against beleaguer'd Heav'n the Gyants move  Hills pil'd on Hills on Mountains Mountains lie  To make their mad approaches to the Skie  Till  Jove  no longer patient took his time  T' avenge with Thunder their audacious Crime  Red Light'ning plaid along the Firmament  And their demolish'd Works to pieces rent  Sing'd with the Flames and with the Bolts transfixt  With Native Earth their Blood the Monsters mixt  The Blood indu'd with animating heat  Did in th' impregnant Earth new Sons beget  They like the Seed from which they sprung accurst  Against the Gods immortal Hatred nurst  An impious arrogant and cruel Brood  Expressing their Original from Blood  Which when the King of Gods beheld from high  Withal revolving in his Memory  What he himself had found on Earth of late  Lycaon  's Guilt and his inhumane Treat  He sigh'd nor longer with his Pity strove  But kindled to a Wrath becoming  Jove    Then call'd a General Council of the Gods  Who Summon'd issue from their Blest Abodes  And fill th' Assembly with a shining Train  A way there is in Heav'n's expanded Plain  Which when the Skies are clear is seen below  And Mortals by the Name of Milky know  The Groundwork is of Stars through which the Road  Lyes open to the Thunderer's Abode  The Gods of greater Nations dwell around  And on the Right and Left the Palace bound  The Commons where they can The Nobler sort  With Windingdoors wide open front the Court  This Place as far as Earth with Heav'n may vie  I dare to call the  Loovre  of the Skie  When all were plac'd in Seats distinctly known  And he their Father had assum'd the Throne  Upon his Iv'ry Sceptre first he leant  Then shook his Head that shook the Firmament  Air Earth and Seas obey'd th' Almighty Nod  And with a gen'ral Fear confess'd the God  At length with Indignation thus he broke  His awful silence and the Pow'rs bespoke  I was not more concern'd in that debate  Of Empire when our Universal State  Was put to hazard and the Giant Race  Our Captive Skies were ready to imbrace  For tho' the Foe was fierce the Seeds of all  Rebellion sprung from one Original  Now wheresoever ambient Waters glide  All are corrupt and all must be destroy'd  Let me this Holy Protestation make  By Hell and Hell's inviolable Lake  I try'd whatever in the GodHead lay  But gangren'd Members must be lopt away  Before the Nobler Parts are tainted to decay  There dwells below a Race of DemiGods  Of Nymphs in Waters and of Fawns in Woods  Who tho' not worthy yet in Heav'n to live  Let 'em at least enjoy that Earth we give  Can these be thought securely lodg'd below  When I my self who no Superior know  I who have Heav'n and Earth at my Command  Have been attempted by  Lycaon  's Hand  At this a Murmur through the Synod went  And with one Voice they vote his Punishment  Thus when conspiring Traytors dar'd to doom  The fall of  Caesar  and in him of  Rome    The Nations trembled with a pious fear  All anxious for their Earthly Thunderer  Nor was their Care O  Caesar  less esteem'd  By thee than that of Heav'n for  Jove  was deem'd  Who with his Hand and Voice did first restrain  Their Murmurs then resum'd his Speech again  The Gods to silence were compos'd and sate  With reverence due to his Superior State  Cancel your pious Cares already he  Has paid his Debt to Justice and to me  Yet what his Crimes and what my Judgments were  Remains for me thus briefly to declare  The Clamours of this vile degenerate Age  The Cries of Orphans and th' Oppressor's Rage  Had reach'd the Stars I will descend said I  In hope to prove this loud Complaint a Lye  Disguis'd in Humane Shape I travell'd round  The World and more than what I heard I found  O'er  Maenalus  I took my steepy way  By Caverns infamous for Beasts of Prey  Then cross'd  Cyllené  and the piny Shade  More infamous by curst  Lycaon  made  Dark Night had cover'd Heav'n and Earth before  I enter'd his Unhospitable Door  Just at my entrance I display'd the Sign  That somewhat was approaching of Divine  The prostrate People pray the Tyrant grins  And adding Prophanation to his Sins  I'll try said he and if a God appear  To prove his Deity shall cost him dear  Twas late the graceless Wretch my Death prepares  When I shou'd soundly sleep opprest with Cares  This dire Experiment he chose to prove  If I were Mortal or undoubted  Jove    But first he had resolv'd to taste my Pow'r  Not long before but in a luckless hour  Some Legates sent from the  Molossian  State  Were on a peaceful Errand come to treat  Of these he murders one he boils the Flesh  And lays the mangl'd Morsels in a Dish  Some part he roasts then serves it up so drest  And bids me welcome to this humane Feast  Mov'd with disdain the Table I o'erturn'd  And with avenging Flames the Palace burn'd  The Tyrant in a fright for shelter gains  The neighb'ring Fields and scours along the Plains  Howling he fled and fain he wou'd have spoke  But humane Voice his Brutal Tongue forsook  About his Lips the gather'd Foam he churns  And breathing slaughters still with rage he burns  But on the bleating Flock his fury turns  His Mantle now his Hide with rugged Pairs  Cleaves to his Back a famish'd Face he bears  His Arms descend his Shoulders sink away  To multiply his Legs for chace of Prey  He grows a Wolf his hoariness remains  And the same Rage in other members reigns  His Eyes still sparkle in a narr'wer space  His Jaws retain the grin and violence of his Face  This was a single ruin but not one  Deserves so just a Punishment alone  Mankind's a Monster and th' Ungodly times  Confed'rate into Guilt are sworn to Crimes  All are alike involv'd in ill and all  Must by the same relentless Fury fall  Thus ended he the greater Gods assent  By Clamours urging his severe intent  The less fill up the Cry for Punishment  Yet still with pity they remember Man  And mourn as much as heav'nly Spirits can  They ask when those were lost of humane Birth  What he wou'd do with all this waste of Earth  If his dispeopl'd World he would resign  To Beasts a mute and more ignoble Line  Neglected Altars must no longer smoke  If none were left to worship and invoke  To whom the Father of the Gods reply'd  Lay that unnecessary fear aside  Mine be the care new People to provide  I will from wondrous Principles ordain  A Race unlike the first and try my Skill again  Already had he toss'd the flaming Brand  And roll'd the Thunder in his spacious Hand  Preparing to discharge on Seas and Land  But stopt for fear thus violently driven  The Sparks should catch his Axletree of Heaven  Remembring in the Fates a time when Fire  Shou'd to the Battlements of Heav'n aspire  And all his blazing Worlds above shou'd burn  And all th' inferior Globe to Cinders turn  His dire Artill'ry thus dismist he bent  His thoughts to some securer Punishment  Concludes to pour a Watry Deluge down  And what he durst not burn resolves to drown  The Northern Breath that freezes Floods he binds  With all the race of Clouddispelling Winds  The South he loos'd who Night and Horror brings  And Foggs are shaken from his flaggy Wings  From his divided Beard two Streams he pours  His Head and rhumy Eyes distill in Showers  With Rain his Robe and heavy Mantle flow  And lazy Mists are lowring on his Brow  Still as he swept along with his clench'd Fist  He squeez'd the Clouds th' imprison'd Clouds resist  The Skies from Pole to Pole with peals resound  And Show'rs inlarg'd come pouring on the Ground  Then clad in Colours of a various Dye  Junonian Iris  breeds a new supply  To feed the Clouds Impetuous Rain descends  The bearded Corn beneath the Burden bends  Defrauded Clowns deplore their perish'd Grain  And the long Labours of the Year are vain  Nor from his Patrimonial Heaven alone  Is  Jove  content to pour his Vengeance down  Aid from his Brother of the Seas he craves  To help him with Auxiliary Waves  The watry Tyrant calls his Brooks and Floods  Who rowl from mossie Caves their moist abodes  And with perpetual Urns his Palace fill  To whom in brief he thus imparts his Will  Small Exhortation needs your Pow rs employ  And this bad World so  Jove  requires destroy  Let loose the Reins to all your watry Store  Bear down the Damms and open every door  The Floods by Nature Enemies to Land  And proudly swelling with their new Command  Remove the living Stones that stopt their way  And gushing from their Source augment the Sea  Then with his Mace their Monarch struck the Ground  With inward trembling Earth receiv'd the Wound  And rising Streams a ready passage found  Th' expanded Waters gather on the Plain  They float the Fields and overtop the Grain  Then rushing onwards with a sweepy sway  Bear Flocks and Folds and lab'ring Hinds away  Nor safe their Dwellings were for sap'd by Floods  Their Houses fell upon their Household Gods  The solid Piles too strongly built to fall  High o'er their Heads behold a watry Wall  Now Seas and Earth were in confusion lost  A World of Waters and without a Coast  One climbs a Cliff one in his Boat is born  And ploughs above where late he sow'd his Corn  Others o'er Chimneytops and Turrets row  And drop their Anchors on the Meads below  Or downward driv'n they bruise the tender Vine  Or tost aloft are knock'd against a Pine  And where of late the Kids had cropt the Grass  The Monsters of the deep now take their place  Insulting Nereids on the Cities ride  And wond'ring Dolphins o'er the Palace glide  On leaves and masts of mighty Oaks they brouze  And their broad Finns entangle in the Boughs  The frighted Wolf now swims amongst the Sheep  The yellow Lion wanders in the deep  His rapid force no longer helps the Boar  The Stag swims faster than he ran before  The Fowls long beating on their Wings in vain  Despair of Land and drop into the Main  Now Hills and Vales no more distinction know  And levell'd Nature lies oppress'd below  The most of Mortals perish in the Flood  The small remainder dies for want of Food  A Mountain of stupendous height there stands  Betwixt th'  Athenian  and  Boeotian  Lands  The bound of fruitful Fields while Fields they were  But then a Field of Waters did appear  Parnassus  is its name whose forky rise  Mounts through the Clouds and mates the lofty Skies  High on the Summet of this dubious Cliff  Deucalion  wafting moor'd his little Skiff  He with his Wife were only left behind  Of perish'd Man they two were human Kind  The Mountain Nymphs and  Themis  they adore  And from her Oracles relief implore  The most upright of Mortal Men was he  The most sincere and holy Woman she  When  Jupiter  surveying Earth from high  Beheld it in a Lake of Water lie  That where so many Millions lately liv'd  But two the best of either Sex surviv'd  He loos'd the Northern Wind fierce  Boreas  flies  To puff away the Clouds and purge the Skies  Serenely while he blows the Vapours driv'n  Discover Heav'uto Earth and Earth to Heav'n  The Billows fall while  Neptune  lays his Mace  On the rough Sea and smooths its furrow'd Face  Already  Triton  at his call appears  Above the Waves a  Tyrian  Robe he wears  And in his hand a crooked Trumpet bears  The Soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire  And give the Waves the signal to retire  His writhen Shell he takes whose narrow vent  Grows by degrees into a large extent  Then gives it breath the Blast with doubling sound  Runs the wide Circuit of the World around  The Sun first heard it in his early East  And met the rattling Eccho's in the West  The Waters listning to the Trumpet's roar  Obey the Summons and forsake the Shoar  A thin Circumference of Land appears  And Earth but not at once her Visage rears  And peeps upon the Seas from upper Grounds  The Streams but just contain'd within their bounds  By slow degrees into their Channels crawl  And Earth increases as the Waters fall  In longer time the tops of Trees appear  Which Mud on their dishonour'd Branches bear  At length the World was all restor'd to view  But desolate and of a sickly hue  Nature beheld her self and stood aghast  A dismal Desert and a silent Waste  Which when  Deucalton  with a piteous look  Beheld he wept and thus to  Pyrrha  spoke  Oh Wife oh Sister oh of all thy kind  The best and only Creature left behind  By Kindred Love and now by Dangers joyn'd  Of Multitudes who breath'd the common Air  We two remain a Species in a Pair  The rest the Seas have swallow'd nor have we  Ev'n of this wretched Life a certainty  The Clouds are still above and while I speak  A second Deluge o'er our heads may break  Shou'd I be snatch'd from hence and thou remain  Without relief or Partner of thy pain  How cou'dst thou such a wretched Life sustain  Shou'd I be left and thou be lost the Sea  That bury'd her I lov'd shou'd bury me  Oh cou'd our Father his old Arts inspire  And make me Heir of his informing Fire  That so I might abolisht Man retrieve  And perisht People in new Souls might live  But Heav'n is pleas'd nor ought we to complain  That we th' Examples of Mankind remain  He said the careful Couple joyn their Tears  And then invoke the Gods with pious Prayers  Thus in Devotion having eas'd their Grief  From sacred Oracles they seek Relief  And to  Cephysus  Brook their way pursue  The Stream was troubled but the Foord they knew  With living Waters in the Fountain bred  They sprinkle first their Garments and their Head  Then took the way which to the Temple led  The Roofs were all defil'd with Moss and Mire  The desart Altars void of Solemn Fire  Before the Gradual prostrate they ador'd  The Pavement kiss'd and thus the Saint implor'd  O Righteous  Themis  if the Pow'rs above  By Pray'rs are bent to pity and to love  If humane Miseries can move their Mind  If yet they can forgive and yet be kind  Tell how we may restore by second birth  Mankind and people desolated Earth  Then thus the gracious Goddess nodding said  Depart and with your Vestments veil your head  And stooping lowly down with loosen'd Zones  Throw each behind your backs your mighty Mother's Bones  Amaz'd the Pair and mute with wonder stand  Till  Pyrrha  first refus'd the dire Command  Forbid it Heav'n said she that I shou'd tear  Those Holy Reliques from the Sepulcher  They ponder'd the mysterious words again  For some new sense and long they sought in vain  At length  Deucalion  clear'd his cloudy brow  And said the dark  Aenigma  will allow  A meaning which if well I understand  From Sacrilege will free the God's Command  This Earth our mighty Mother is the Stones  In her capacious Body are her Bones  These we must cast behind With hope and fear  The Woman did the new Solution hear  The Man diffides in his own Augury  And doubts the Gods yet both resolve to try  Descending from the Mount they first unbind  Their Vests and veil'd they cast the Stones behind  The Stones a Miracle to Mortal View  But long Tradition makes it pass for true  Did first the Rigour of their Kind expel  And suppled into softness as they fell  Then swell'd and swelling by degrees grew warm  And took the Rudiments of Humane Form  Imperfect Shapes in Marble such are seen  When the rude Chizzel does the Man begin  While yet the roughness of the Stone remains  Without the rising Muscles and the Veins  The sappy parts and next resembling juice  Were turn'd to moisture for the Bodies use  Supplying humours blood and nourishment  The rest too solid to receive a bent  Converts to Bones and what was once a Vein  Its former Name and Nature did retain  By help of Pow'r Divine in little space  What the Man threw assum'd a Manly Face  And what the Wife renew'd the Female Race  Hence we derive our Nature born to bear  Laborious Life and harden'd into Care  The rest of Animals from teeming Earth  Produc'd in various forms receiv'd their birth  The native moisture in its close retreat  Digested by the Sun's Aetherial Heat  As in a kindly Womb began to breed  Then swell'd and quicken'd by the vital Seed  And some in less and some in longer space  Were ripen'd into form and took a sev'ral face  Thus when the  Nile  from  Pharian  Fields is fled  And seeks with Ebbing Tides his Ancient Bed  The fat Manure with Heav'nly Fire is warm'd  And crusted Creatures as in Wombs are form'd  These when they turn the Glebe the Peasants find  Some rude and yet unfinish'd in their kind  Short of their Limbs a lame imperfect Birth  One half alive and one of lifeless Earth  For heat and moisture when in Bodies joyn'd  The temper that results from either Kind  Conception makes and fighting till they mix  Their mingled Atoms in each other fix  Thus Nature's hand the Genial Bed prepares  With friendly Discord and with fruitful Wars  From hence the surface of the Ground with Mud  And Slime besmear'd the faeces of the Flood  Receiv'd the Rays of Heav'n and sucking in  The Seeds of Heat new Creatures did begin  Some were of sev'ral sorts produc'd before  But of new Monsters Earth created more  Unwillingly but yet she brought to light  Thee  Python  too the wondring World to fright  And the new Nations with so dire a sight  So monstrous was his bulk so large a space  Did his vast Body and long Train embrace  Whom  Phoebus  basking on a Bank espy'd  E'er now the God his Arrows had not try'd  But on the trembling Deer or Mountain Goat  At this new Quarry he prepares to shoot  Though every Shaft took place he spent the Store  Of his full Quiver and 'twas long before  Th' expiring Serpent wallow'd in his Gore  Then to preserve the Fame of such a deed  Python  slain he  Pythian  Games decreed  Where Noble Youths for Mastership shou'd strive  To Quoit to Run and Steeds and Chariots drive  The Prize was Fame In witness of Renown  An Oaken Garland did the Victor crown  The Lawrel was not yet for Triumphs born  But every Green alike by  Phoebus  worn  Did with promiscuous Grace his flowing Locks adorn  The Transformation of DAPHNE into a Lawrel  The first and fairest of his Loves was she  Whom not blind Fortune but the dire decree  Of angry  Cupid  forc'd him to desire  Daphne  her Name and  Peneus  was her Sire  Swell'd with the Pride that new Success attends  He sees the Stripling while his Bow he bends  And thus insults him Thou lascivious Boy  Are Arms like these for Children to employ  Know such Atchievements are my proper claim  Due to my vigour and unerring aim  Resistless are my Shafts and  Python  late  In such a feather'd Death has found his fate  Take up thy Torch and lay my Weapons by  With that the feeble Souls of Lovers fry  To whom the Son of  Venus  thus reply'd  Phoebus  thy Shafts are sure on all beside  But mine on  Phoebus  mine the Fame shall be  Of all thy Conquests when I conquer thee  He said and soaring swiftly wing'd his flight  Nor stopt but on  Parnassus  airy height  Two diff'rent Shafts he from his Quiver draws  One to repel Desire and one to cause  One Shaft is pointed with refulgent Gold  To bribe the Love and make the Lover bold  One blunt and tipt with Lead whose base allay  Provokes Disdain and drives Desire away  The blunted Bolt against the Nymph he drest  But with the sharp transfixt  Apollo  's Breast  Th' enamour'd Deity pursues the Chace  The scornful Damsel shuns his loath'd Embrace  In hunting Beasts of Prey her Youth employs  And  Phoebe  rivals in her rural Joys  With naked Neck she goes and Shoulders bare  And with a Fillet binds her flowing Hair  By many Suitors sought she mocks their pains  And still her vow'd Virginity maintains  Impatient of a Yoke the name of Bride  She shuns and hates the Joys she never try'd  On Wilds and Woods she fixes her desire  Nor knows what Youth and kindly Love inspire  Her Father chides her oft Thou ow'st says he  A Husband to thy self a Son to me  She like a Crime abhors the Nuptial Bed  She glows with Blushes and she hangs her Head  Then casting round his Neck her tender Arms  Sooths him with Blandishments and filial Charms  Give me my Lord she said to live and die  A spotless Maid without the Marriage Tye  'Tis but a small Request I beg no more  Than what  Diana  's Father gave before  The good old Sire was soften'd to consent  But said her Wish wou'd prove her Punishment  For so much Youth and so much Beauty joyn'd  Oppos'd the State which her desires design'd  The God of Light aspiring to her Bed  Hopes what he seeks with flattering Fancies fed  And is by his own Oracles misled  And as in empty Fields the Stubble burns  Or nightly Travellers when day returns  Their useless Torches on dry Hedges throw  That catch the Flames and kindle all the row  So burns the God consuming in desire  And feeding in his Breast a fruitless Fire  Her wellturn'd Neck he view'd her Neck was bare  And on her Shoulders her dishevel'd Hair  Oh were it comb'd said he with what a grace  Wou'd every waving Curl become her Face  He view'd her Eyes like Heavenly Lamps that shone  He view'd her Lips too sweet to view alone  Her taper Fingers and her panting Breast  He praises all he sees and for the rest  Believes the Beauties yet unseen are best  Swift as the Wind the Damsel fled away  Nor did for these alluring Speeches stay  Stay Nymph he cry'd I follow not a Foe  Thus from the Lyon trips the trembling Doe  Thus from the Wolf the frighten'd Lamb removes  And from pursuing Faulcons fearful Doves  Thou shunn'st a God and shunn'st a God that loves  Ah lest some Thorn shou'd pierce thy tender Foot  Or thou shou'dst fall in flying my pursuit  To sharp uneven Ways thy steps decline  Abate thy Speed and I will bate of mine  Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly  Nor basely born nor Shepherd's Swain am I  Perhaps thou know'st not my superior State  And from that Ignorance proceeds thy Hate  Me  Claros    Delphos    Tenedos  obey  These Hands the  Patareian  Scepter sway  The King of Gods begot me What shall be  Or is or ever was in Fate I see  Mine is th' invention of the charming Lyre  Sweet Notes and Heavenly Numbers I inspire  Sure is my Bow unerring is my Dart  But ah more deadly his who pierc'd my Heart  Med'cine is mine what Herbs and Simples grow  In Fields and Forrests all their pow'rs I know  And am the great Physician call'd below  Alas that Fields and Forrests can afford  No Remedies to heal their Lovesick Lord  To cure the pains of Love no Plant avails  And his own Physick the Physician fails  She heard not half so furiously she flies  And on her Ear th' imperfect Accent dies  Fear gave her Wings and as she fled the Wind  Increasing spread her flowing Hair behind  And left her Legs and Thighs expos'd to view  Which made the God more eager to pursue  The God was young and was too hotly bent  To lose his time in empty Compliment  But led by Love and fir'd with such a sight  Impetuously pursu'd his near delight  As when th' impatient Greyhound slipt from far  Bounds o'er the Glebe to course the fearful Hare  She in her speed does all her safety lay  And he with double speed pursues the Prey  O'erruns her at the sitting turn and licks  His Chaps in vain and blows upon the Flix  She scapes and for the neighb'ring Covert strives  And gaining shelter doubts if yet she lives  If little things with great we may compare  Such was the God and such the flying Fair  She urg'd by Fear her feet did swiftly move  But he more swiftly who was urg'd by Love  He gathers ground upon her in the chace  Now breaths upon her Hair with nearer pace  And just is fast'ning on the wish'd Embrace  The Nymph grew pale and in a mortal fright  Spent with the labour of so long a flight  And now despairing cast a mournful Look  Upon the Streams of her Paternal Brook  Oh help she cry'd in this extreamest need  If Water Gods are Deities indeed  Gape Earth and this unhappy Wretch intomb  Or change my form whence all my sorrows come  Scarce had she finish'd when her Feet she found  Benum'd with cold and fasten'd to the Ground  A filmy Rind about her Body grows  Her Hair to Leaves her Arms extend to Boughs  The Nymph is all into a Lawrel gone  The smoothness of her Skin remains alone  Yet  Phoebus  loves her still and casting round  Her Bole his Arms some little warmth he found  The Tree still panted in th' unfinish'd part  Not wholly vegetive and heav'd her Heart  He fixt his Lips upon the trembling Rind  It swerv'd aside and his Embrace declin'd  To whom the God Because thou canst not be  My Mistress I espouse thee for my Tree  Be thou the prize of Honour and Renown  The deathless Poet and the Poem crown  Thou shalt the  Roman  Festivals adorn  And after Poets be by Victors worn  Thou shalt returning  Caesar  's Triumph grace  When Pomps shall in a long Procession pass  Wreath'd on the Posts before his Palace wait  And be the sacred Guardian of the Gate  Secure from Thunder and unharm'd by  Jove    Unfading as th' immortal Pow'rs above  And as the locks of  Phoebus  are unshorn  So shall perpetual Green thy Boughs adorn  The grateful Tree was pleas'd with what he said  And shook the shady Honours of her Head  The Transformation of IO into a Heyfar  An ancient Forrest in  Thessalia  grows  Which  Tempe  's pleasing Valley does inclose  Through this the rapid  Peneus  takes his course  From  Pindus  rowling with impetuous force  Mists from the Rivers mighty fall arise  And deadly damps inclose the cloudy Skies  Perpetual Fogs are hanging o'er the Wood  And sounds of Waters deaf the Neighbourhood  Deep in a Rocky Cave he makes abode  A Mansion proper for a mourning God  Here he gives Audience issuing out Decrees  To Rivers his dependant Deities  On this occasion hither they resort  To pay their homage and to make their Court  All doubtful whether to congratulate  His Daughter's Honour or lament her Fate  Sperchaeus  crown'd with Poplar first appears  Then old  Apidanus  came crown'd with Years  Enipeus  turbulent  Amphrysos  tame  And  Aeas  last with lagging Waters came  Then of his Kindred Brooks a numerous throng  Condole his loss and bring their Urns along  Not one was wanting of the watry Train  That fill'd his Flood or mingled with the Main  But  Inachus  who in his Cave alone  Wept not another's Losses but his own  For his dear  Io  whether stray'd or dead  To him uncertain doubtful Tears he shed  He sought her through the World but sought in vain  And no where finding rather fear'd her slain  Her just returning from her Father's Brook  Jove  had beheld with a desiring look  And Oh fair Daughter of the Flood he said  Worthy alone of  Jove  's Imperial Bed  Happy whoever shall those Charms possess  The King of Gods nor is thy Lover less  Invites thee to yon cooler Shades to shun  The scorching Rays of the Meridian Sun  Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the Grove  Alone without a Guide thy Guide is  Jove  No puny Pow'r but he whose high Command  Is unconfin'd who rules the Seas and Land  And tempers Thunder in his awful hand  Oh fly not For she fled from his Embrace  O'er  Lerna  's Pastures he pursu'd the Chace  Along the Shades of the  Lyrcaean  Plain  At length the God who never asks in vain  Involv'd with Vapours imitating Night  Both Air and Earth and then suppress'd her flight  And mingling Force with Love enjoy'd the full delight  Mean time the jealous  Juno  from on high  Survey'd the fruitful Fields of  Arcady    And wonder'd that the Mist shou'd overrun  The face of Daylight and obscure the Sun  No Nat'ral Cause she found from Brooks or Bogs  Or marshy Lowlands to produce the Fogs  Then round the Skies she sought for  Jupiter    Her faithless Husband but no  Jove  was there  Suspecting now the worst Or I she said  Am much mistaken or am much betray'd  With fury she precipitates her flight  Dispels the shadows of dissembled Night  And to the Day restores his native Light  Th' Almighty  Leacher  careful to prevent  The consequence foreseeing her descent  Transforms his Mistress in a trice and now  In  Io  's place appears a lovely Cow  So sleek her Skin so faultless was her Make  Ev'n  Juno  did unwilling pleasure take  To see so fair a Rival of her Love  And what she was and whence enquir'd of  Jove    Of what fair Herd and from what Pedigree  The God half caught was forc'd upon a lye  And said she sprung from Earth She took the word  And begg'd the beauteous Heyfar of her Lord  What should he do 'twas equal shame to  Jove  Or to relinquish or betray his Love  Yet to refuse so slight a Gift wou'd be  But more t' increase his Consort's Jealousie  Thus fear and love by turns his heart assail'd  And stronger love had sure at length prevail'd  But some faint hope remain'd his jealous Queen  Had not the Mistress through the Heyfar seen  The cautious Goddess of her Gift possest  Yet harbour'd anxious thoughts within her Breast  As she who knew the falshood of her  Jove    And justly fear'd some new relapse of Love  Which to prevent and to secure her care  To trusty  Argus  she commits the fair  The head of  Argus  as with Stars the Skies  Was compass'd round and wore an hundred Eyes  But two by turns their Lids in Slumber steep  The rest on duty still their station keep  Nor cou'd the total Constellation sleep  Thus ever present to his Eyes and Mind  His Charge was still before him tho' behind  In Fields he suffer'd her to feed by Day  But when the setting Sun to Night gave way  The Captive Cow he summon'd with a call  And drove her back and ty'd her to the Stall  On Leaves of Trees and bitter Herbs she fed  Heav'n was her Canopy bare Earth her Bed  So hardly lodg'd and to digest her Food  She drank from troubled Streams defil'd with Mud  Her woeful Story fain she wou'd have told  With hands upheld but had no hands to hold  Her Head to her ungentle Keeper bow'd  She strove to speak she spoke not but she low'd  Affrighted with the Noise she look'd around  And seem'd t' inquire the Author of the Sound  Once on the Banks where often she had play'd  Her Father's Banks she came and there survey'd  Her alter'd Visage and her branching Head  And starting from her self she wou'd have fled  Her fellow Nymphs familiar to her Eyes  Beheld but knew her not in this disguise  Ev'n  Inachus  himself was ignorant  And in his Daughter did his Daughter want  She follow'd where her Fellows went as she  Were still a Partner of the Company  They stroak her Neck the gentle Heyfar stands  And her Neck offers to their stroaking Hands  Her Father gave her Grass the Grass she took  And lick'd his Palms and cast a piteous Look  And in the language of her Eyes she spoke  She wou'd have told her Name and ask'd relief  But wanting Words in Tears she tells her Grief  Which with her Foot she makes him understand  And prints the name of  Io  in the Sand  Ah wretched me her mournful Father cry'd  She with a sigh to wretched me reply'd  About her Milkwhite Neck his Arms he threw  And wept and then these tender Words ensue  And art thou she whom I have sought around  The World and have at length so sadly found  So found is worse than lost with mutual Words  Thou answer'st not no Voice thy Tongue affords  But Sighs are deeply drawn from out thy Breast  And Speech deny'd by Lowing is express'd  Unknowing I prepar'd thy Bridal Bed  With empty hopes of happy Issue fed  But now the Husband of a Herd must be  Thy Mate and bell'wing Sons thy Progeny  Oh were I mortal Death might bring relief  But now my Godhead but extends my Grief  Prolongs my Woes of which no end I see  And makes me curse my Immortality  More had he said but fearful of her stay  The Starry Guardian drove his Charge away  To some fresh Pasture on a hilly height  He sate himself and kept her still in sight  The Eyes of ARGUS Transform'd into a Peacock's Train  Now  Jove  no longer cou'd her suff'rings bear  But call'd in haste his airy Messenger  The Son of  Maïa  with severe decree  To kill the Keeper and to set her free  With all his Harness soon the God was sped  His flying Hat was fastned on his Head  Wings on his Heels were hung and in his Hand  He holds the Vertue of the Snaky Wand  The liquid Air his moving Pinions wound  And in the moment shoot him on the Ground  Before he came in sight the crafty God  His Wings dismiss'd but still retain'd his Rod  That Sleepprocuring Wand wise  Hermes  took  But made it seem to sight a Shepherd's Hook  With this he did a Herd of Goats controul  Which by the way he met and slily stole  Clad like a Country Swain he Pip'd and Sung  And playing drove his jolly Troop along  With pleasure  Argus  the Musician heeds  But wonders much at those new vocal Reeds  And whosoe'er thou art my Friend said he  Up hither drive thy Goats and play by me  This Hill has Browz for them and Shade for thee  The God who was with case induc'd to climb  Began Discourse to pass away the time  And still betwixt his Tuneful Pipe he plyes  And watch'd his Hour to close the Keeper's Eyes  With much ado he partly kept awake  Not suff'ring all his Eyes Repose to take  And ask'd the Stranger who did Reeds invent  And whence began so rare an Instrument  The Transformation of SYRINX into Reeds  Then  Hermes  thus A Nymph of late there was  Whose Heav'nly Form her Follows did surpass  The Pride and Joy of fair  Arcadia  's Plains  Belov'd by Deities ador'd by Swains  Syrinx  her Name by  Sylvans  oft pursu'd  As oft she did the Lustful Gods delude  The Rural and the Woodland Pow'rs disdain'd  With  Cynthia  hunted and her Rites maintain'd  Like  Phoebe  clad even  Phoebe  's self she seems  So Tall so Streight such wellproportion'd Limbs  The nicest Eye did no distinction know  But that the Goddess bore a Golden Bow  Distinguish'd thus the sight she cheated too  Descending from  Lycaeus    Pan  admires  The matchless Nymph and burns with new Desires  A Crown of Pine upon his Head he wore  And thus began her Pity to implore  But e'er he thus began she took her flight  So swift she was already out of sight  Nor stay'd to hear the Courtship of the God  But bent her course to  Ladon  's gentle Flood  There by the River stopt and tir'd before  Relief from Water Nymphs her Pray'rs implore  Now while the Lustful God with speedy pace  Just thought to strain her in a strict Embrace  He fill'd his Arms with Reeds new rising on the place  And while he sighs his ill success to find  The tender Canes were shaken by the Wind  And breath'd a mournful Air unheard before  That much surprizing  Pan  yet pleas'd him more  Admiring this new Musick Thou he said  Who canst not be the Partner of my Bed  At least shalt be the Consort of my Mind  And often often to my Lips be joyn'd  He form'd the Reeds proportion'd as they are  Unequal in their length and wax'd with Care  They still retain the Name of his Ungrateful Fair  While  Hermes  pip'd and sung and told his Tale  The Keeper's winking Eyes began to fail  And drowsie Slumber on the Lids to creep  Till all the Watchman was at length asleep  Then soon the God his Voice and Song supprest  And with his pow'rful Rod confirm'd his Rest  Without delay his crooked Faulchion drew  And at one fatal stroke the Keeper slew  Down from the Rock fell the dissever'd Head  Opening its Eyes in Death and falling bled  And mark'd the passage with a Crimson trail  Thus  Argus  lies in pieces cold and pale  And all his hundred Eyes with all their light  Are clos'd at once in one perpetual Night  These  Juno  takes that they no more may fail  And spreads them in her Peacock's gaudy Tail  Impatient to revenge her injur'd Bed  She wreaks her Anger on her Rival's head  With Furies frights her from her Native Home  And drives her gadding round the World to roam  Nor ceas'd her Madness and her Flight before  She touch'd the limits of the  Pharian  Shoar  At length arriving on the Banks of  Nile    Weary'd with length of ways and worn with toil  She laid her down and leaning on her Knees  Invok'd the Cause of all her Miseries  And cast her languishing regards above  For help from Heav'n and her ungrateful  Jove  She sigh'd she wept she low'd 'twas all she cou'd  And with Unkindness seem'd to tax the God  Last with an humble Pray'r she beg'd Repose  Or Death at least to finish all her Woes  Jove  heard her Vows and with a flatt'ring look  In her behalf to jealous  Juno  spoke  He cast his Arms about her Neck and said  Dame rest secure no more thy Nuptial Bed  This Nymph shall violate by  Styx  I swear  And every Oath that binds the Thunderer  The Goddess was appeas'd and at the word  Was  Io  to her former Shape restor'd  The rugged Hair began to fall away  The sweetness of her Eyes did only stay  Tho' not so large her crooked Horns decrease  The Wideness of her Jaws and Nostrils cease  Her Hoofs to Hands return in little space  The five long taper Fingers take their place  And nothing of the Heyfar now is seen  Beside the native whiteness of the Skin  Erected on her Feet she walks again  And Two the duty of the Four sustain  She tries her Tongue her Silence softly breaks  And fears her former Lowings when she speaks  A Goddess now through all th'  Aegyptian  State  And serv'd by Priests who in white Linnen wait  Her Son was  Epaphus  at length believ'd  The Son of  Jove  and as a God receiv'd  With Sacrifice ador'd and publick Pray'rs  He common Temples with his Mother shares  Equal in Years and Rival in Renown  With  Epaphus  the youthful  Phaeton  Like Honour claims and boasts his Sire the Sun  His haughty Looks and his assuming Air  The Son of  Isis  cou'd no longer bear  Thou tak'st thy Mother's word too far said he  And hast usurp'd thy boasted Pedigree  Go base Pretender to a borrow'd Name  Thus tax'd he blush'd with Anger and with Shame  But Shame repress'd his Rage The daunted Youth  Soon seeks his Mother and enquires the truth  Mother said he this Infamy was thrown  By  Epaphus  on you and me your Son  He spoke in publick told it to my Face  Nor durst I vindicate the dire Disgrace  Even I the bold the sensible of Wrong  Restrain'd by Shame was forc'd to hold my Tongue  To hear an open Slander is a Curse  But not to find an Answer is a worse  If I am Heav'nbegot assert your Son  By some sure Sign and make my Father known  To right my Honour and redeem your own  He said and saying cast his Arms about  Her Neck and begg'd her to resolve the Doubt  'Tis hard to judge if  Clymenè  were mov'd  More by his Pray'r whom she so dearly lov'd  Or more with Fury fir'd to find her Name  Traduc'd and made the sport of common Fame  She stretch'd her Arms to Heav'n and fix'd her Eyes  On that fair Planet that adorns the Skies  Now by those Beams said she whose holy Fires  Consume my Breast and kindle my Desires  By him who sees us both and chears our sight  By him the publick Minister of Light  I swear that  Sun  begot thee if I lye  Let him his chearful Influence deny  Let him no more this perjur'd Creature see  And shine on all the World but only me  If still you doubt your Mother's Innocence  His Eastern Mansion is not far from hence  With little pains you to his  Levè  go  And from himself your Parentage may know  With joy th' ambitious Youth his Mother heard  And eager for the Journey soon prepar'd  He longs the World beneath him to survey  To guide the Chariot and to give the Day  From  Meroe  's burning Sands he bends his Course  Nor less in  India  feels his Father's force  His Travel urging till he came in sight  And saw the Palace by the Purple Light  The End of the First Book  To Her Grace the Dutchess of Roxbu  OVID's METAMORPHOSES BOOK II  Translated by Mr ADDISON  The Story of PHAETON  _THE Sun's bright Palace on high Columns rais'd  With burnish'd Gold and flaming Jewels blaz'd  The FoldingGates diffus'd a Silver Light  And with a milder Gleam refresh'd the Sight  Of polish'd Iv'ry was the Cov'ring wrought  The Matter vied not with the Sculptor's Thought  For in the Portal was display'd on high  The Work of  Vulcan  a fictitious Sky  A waving Sea th' inferiour Earth embrac'd  And Gods and Goddesses the Waters grac'd  Aegeon  here a mighty Whale bestrode  Triton  and  Proteus  the deceiving God  With  Doris  here were carv'd and all her Train  Some loosely swimming in the figur'd Main  While some on Rocks their dropping Hair divide  And some on Fishes through the Waters glide  Tho' various Features did the Sisters grace  A Sister's Likeness was in ev'ry Face  On Earth a diff'rent Landskip courts the Eyes  Men Towns and Beasts in distant Prospects rise  And Nymphs and Streams and Woods and rural Deities  O'er all the Heav'ns refulgent Image shines  On either Gate were six engraven Signs  Here  Phaeton  still gaining on th' Ascent  To his suspected Father's Palace went  Till pressing forward through the bright Abode  He saw at Distance the illustrious God  He saw at Distance or the dazling Light  Had flash'd too strongly on his aking Sight  The God sits high exalted on a Throne  Of blazing Gems with Purple Garments on  The Hours in order rang'd on either Hand  And Days and Months and Years and Ages stand  Here Spring appears with flow'ry Chaplets bound  Here Summer in her wheaten Garland crown'd  Here Autumn the rich trodden Grapes besmear  And hoary Winter shivers in the Reer  Phoebus  beheld the Youth from off his Throne  That Eye which looks on All was fix'd in One  He saw the Boy's Confusion in his Face  Surpriz'd at all the Wonders of the Place  And cries aloud " What wants my Son for know  " My Son thou art and I must call thee so  " Light of the World the trembling Youth replies  " Illustrious Parent since you don't despise  " The Parent's Name some certain Token give  " That I may  Clymenè  's proud Boast believe  " Nor longer under false Reproaches grieve  The tender Sire was touch'd with what he said  And flung the Blaze of Glories from his Head  And bid the Youth advance " My Son said he  " Come to thy Father's Arms for  Clymenè  " Has told thee true a Parent's Name I own  " And deem thee worthy to be call'd my Son  " As a sure Proof make some Request and I  " Whate'er it be with that Request comply  " By  Styx  I swear whose Waves are hid in Night  " And roul impervious to My piercing Sight  The Youth transported asks without Delay  To guide the Sun's bright Chariot for a Day  The God repented of the Oath he took  For Anguish thrice his radiant Head he shook  " My Son says he some other Proof require  " Rash was my Promise rash is thy Desire  " I'd fain deny this Wish which thou hast made  " Or what I can't deny wou'd fain disswade  " Too vast and hazardous the Task appears  " Nor suited to thy Strength nor to thy Years  " Thy Lot is Mortal but thy Wishes fly  " Beyond the Province of Mortality  " There is not one of all the Gods that dares  " However skill'd in other great Affairs  " To mount the burning Axletree but I  " Not  Jove  himself the Ruler of the Sky  " That hurles the threefork'd Thunder from above  " Dares try his Strength yet who so strong as  Jove  " The Steeds climb up the first Ascent with Pain  " And when the middle Firmament they gain  " If downward from the Heav'ns my Head I bow  " And see the Earth and Ocean hang below  "Ev'n I am seiz'd with Horror and Affright  " And my own Heart misgives me at the Sight  " A mighty Downfal steeps the Ev'ning Stage  " And steddy Reins must curb the Horses Rage  "  Tethys  her self has fear'd to see me driv'n  " Down headlong from the Precipice of Heav'n  " Besides consider what impetuous Force  " Turns Stars and Planets in a diff'rent Course  " I steer against their Motions nor am I  " Born back by all the Current of the Sky  " But how cou'd you resist the Orbs that roul  " In adverse Whirls and stem the rapid Pole  " But you perhaps may hope for pleasing Woods  " And stately Domes and Cities fill'd with Gods  " While through a thousand Snares your Progress lies  " Where Forms of starry Monsters stock the Skies  " For shou'd you hit the doubtful Way aright  " The Bull with stooping Horns stands Opposite  " Next him the bright  Haemonian  Bow is strung  " And next the Lion's grinning Visage hung  " The Scorpion's Claws here clasp a wide Extent  " And here the Crab's in lesser Clasps are bent  " Nor wou'd you find it easie to compose  " The mettled Steeds when from their Nostrils flows  " The scorching Fire that in their Entrails glows  " Ev'n I their headstrong Fury scarce restrain  " When they grow warm and restif to the Rein  " Let not my Son a fatal Gift require  " But O in time recall your rash Desire  " You ask a Gift that may your Parent tell  " Let these my Fears your Parentage reveal  "And learn a Father from a Father's Care  " Look on my Face or if my Heart lay bare  " Cou'd you but look you'd read the Father there  " Chuse out a Gift from Seas or Earth or Skies  " For open to your Wish all Nature lies  " Only decline this one unequal Task  " For 'tis a Mischief not a Gift you ask  " You ask a real Mischief  Phaeton    " Nay hang not thus about my Neck my Son  " I grant your Wish and  Styx  has heard my Voice  " Chuse what you will but make a wiser Choice  Thus did the God th' unwary Youth advise  But he still longs to travel through the Skies  When the fond Father for in vain he pleads  At length to the  Vulcanian  Chariot leads  A Golden Axle did the Work uphold  Gold was the Beam the Wheels were orb'd with Gold  The Spokes in Rows of Silver pleas'd the Sight  The Seat with partycolour'd Gems was bright  Apollo  shin'd amid the Glare of Light  The Youth with secret Joy the Work surveys  When now the Morn disclos'd her purple Rays  The Stars were fled for  Lucifer  had chase't  The Stars away and fled himself at last  Soon as the Father saw the rosy Morn  And the Moon shining with a blunter Horn  He bid the nimble  Hours  without Delay  Bring forth the Steeds the nimble  Hours  obey  From their full Racks the gen'rous Steeds retire  Dropping ambrosial Foams and snorting Fire  Still anxious for his Son the God of Day  To make him Proof against the burning Ray  His Temples with Celestial Ointment wet  Of sov'raign Virtue to repel the Heat  Then fix'd the beamy Circle on his Head  And fetch'd a deep foreboding Sigh and said  " Take this at least this last Advice my Son  " Keep a stiff Rein and move but gently on  " The Coursers of themselves will run too fast  " Your Art must be to Moderate their Haste  " Drive 'em not on Directly through the Skies  " But where the  Zodiac  's Winding Circle lies  " Along the midmost  Zone  but sally forth  " Nor to the distant South nor stormy North  " The Horses Hoofs a beaten Track will show  " But neither mount too high nor sink too low  " That no new Fires or Heav'n or Earth infest  " Keep the mid Way the middle Way is best  " Nor where in radiant Folds the Serpent twines  " Direct your Course nor where the Altar shines  " Shun both Extreams the rest let Fortune guide  " And better for thee than thy self provide  " See while I speak the Shades disperse away  "  Aurora  gives the Promise of a Day  " I'm call'd nor can I make a longer Stay  " Snatch up the Reins or still th' Attempt forsake  " And not my Chariot but my Counsel take  " While yet securely on the Earth you stand  " Nor touch the Horses with too rash a Hand  " Let Me alone to light the World while You  " Enjoy those Beams which you may safely view  He spoke in vain the Youth with active Heat  And sprightly Vigour vaults into the Seat  And joys to hold the Reins and fondly gives  Those Thanks his Father with Remorse receives  Mean while the restless Horses neigh'd aloud  Breathing out Fire and pawing where they stood  Tethys  not knowing what had past gave way  And all the Waste of Heav'n before 'em lay  They spring together out and swiftly bear  The flying Youth through Clouds and yielding Air  With wingy Speed outstrip the Eastern Wind  And leave the Breezes of the Morn behind  The Youth was light nor cou'd he fill the Seat  Or poise the Chariot with its wonted Weight  But as at Sea th' unballass'd Vessel rides  Cast to and fro the Sport of Winds and Tides  So in the bounding Chariot toss'd on high  The Youth is hurry'd headlong through the Sky  Soon as the Steeds perceive it they forsake  Their stated Course and leave the beaten Track  The Youth was in a Maze nor did he know  Which way to turn the Reins or where to go  Nor wou'd the Horses had he known obey  Then the Sev'n Stars first felt  Apollo  's Ray  And wish'd to dip in the forbidden Sea  The folded Serpent next the frozen Pole  Stiff and benum'd before began to roll  And rag'd with inward Heat and threaten'd War  And shot a redder Light from ev'ry Star  Nay and 'tis said  Bootes  too that fain  Thou wou'd'st have fled tho' cumber'd with thy Wane  Th' unhappy Youth then bending down his Head  Saw Earth and Ocean far beneath him spread  His Colour chang'd he startled at the Sight  And his Eyes Darken'd by too great a Light  Now cou'd he wish the fiery Steeds untry'd  His Birth obscure and his Request deny'd  Now wou'd he  Merops  for his Father own  And quit his boasted Kindred to the Sun  So fares the Pilot when his Ship is tost  In troubled Seas and all its Steerage lost  He gives her to the Winds and in Despair  Seeks his last Refuge in the Gods and Pray'r  What cou'd he do his Eyes if backward cast  Find a long Path he had already past  If forward still a longer Path they find  Both he compares and measures in his Mind  And sometimes casts an Eye upon the East  And sometimes looks on the forbidden West  The Horses Names he knew not in the Fright  Nor wou'd he loose the Reins nor cou'd he hold 'em right  Now all the Horrors of the Heav'ns he spies  And monstrous Shadows of prodigious Size  That deck'd with Stars lye scatter'd o'er the Skies  There is a Place above where  Scorpio  bent  In Tail and Arms surrounds a vast Extent  In a wide Circuit of the Heav'ns he shines  And fills the Space of Two Coelestial Signs  Soon as the Youth beheld him vex'd with Heat  Brandish his Sting and in his Poison sweat  Half dead with sudden Fear he dropt the Reins  The Horses felt 'em loose upon their Mains  And flying out through all the Plains above  Ran uncontroul'd wheree'er their Fury drove  Rush'd on the Stars and through a pathless Way  Of unknown Regions hurry'd on the Day  And now above and now below they flew  And near the Earth the burning Chariot drew  The Clouds disperse in Fumes the wond'ring Moon  Beholds her Brother's Steeds beneath her own  The Highlands smoak cleft by the piercing Rays  Or clad with Woods in their own Fewel blaze  Next o'er the Plains where ripen'd Harvests grow  The running Conflagration spreads Below  But these are trivial Ills whole Cities burn  And peopled Kingdoms into Ashes turn  The Mountains kindle as the Car draws near  Athos  and  Tmolus  red with Fires appear  Oeagrian Haemus  then a single Name  And Virgin  Helicon  increase the Flame  Taurus  and  Oetè  glare amid the Sky  And  Ida  spight of all her Fountains Dry  Eryx  and  Othrys  and  Cithaeron  glow  And  Rhodopè  no longer cloath'd in Snow  High  Pindus    Mimas  and  Parnassus  sweat  And  Aetna  rages with redoubled Heat  Ev'n  Scythia  through her hoary Regions warm'd  In vain with all her native Frost was arm'd  Cover'd with Flames the tow'ring  Appennine    And  Caucasus  and proud  Olympus  shine  And where the longextended  Alpes  aspire  Now stands a huge continu'd Range of Fire  Th' astonisht Youth wheree'er his Eyes cou'd turn  Beheld the Universe around him burn  The World was in a Blaze nor cou'd he bear  The sultry Vapours and the scorching Air  Which from below as from a Furnace flow'd  And now the Axletree beneath him glow'd  Lost in the whirling Clouds that round him broke  And white with Ashes hov'ring in the Smoke  He flew wheree'er the Horses drove nor knew  Whither the Horses drove or where he flew  'Twas then they say the swarthy Moor begun  To change his Hue and Blacken in the Sun  Then  Libya  first of all her Moisture drain'd  Became a barren Waste a Wild of Sand  The WaterNymphs lament their empty Urns  Baeotia  robb'd of Silver  Dirce  mourns  Corinth Pyrene  's wasted Spring bewails  And  Argos  grieves whilst  Amymonè  fails  The Floods are drain'd from ev'ry distant Coast  Ev'n  Tanaïs  tho' fix'd in Ice was lost  Enrag'd  Caïcus  and  Lycormas  roar  And  Xanthus  fated to be burnt once more  The fam'd  Maeander  that unweary'd strays  Through mazy Windings smoaks in ev'ry Maze  From his lov'd  Babylon Euphrates  flies  The bigswoln  Ganges  and the  Danube  rise  In thick'ning Fumes and darken half the Skies  In Flames  Ismenos  and the  Phasis  roul'd  And  Tagus  floating in his melted Gold  The Swans that on  Caÿster  often try'd  Their tuneful Songs now sung their last and dy'd  The frighted  Nile  ran off and under Ground  Conceal'd his Head nor can it yet be found  His sev'n divided Currents all are dry  And where they roul'd sev'n Gaping Trenches lye  No more the  Rhine  or  Rhone  their Course maintain  Nor  Tiber  of his promis'd Empire vain  The Ground deepcleft admits the dazling Ray  And startles  Pluto  with the Flash of Day  The Seas shrink in and to the Sight disclose  Wide naked Plains where once their Billows rose  Their Rocks are all discover'd and increase  The Number of the scatter'd  Cyclades  The Fish in Sholes about the Bottom creep  Nor longer dares the crooked Dolphin leap  Gasping for Breath th' unshapen  Phocae  die  And on the boiling Wave extended lye  Nereus  and  Doris  with her Virgin Train  Seek out the last Recesses of the Main  Beneath unfathomable Depths they faint  And secret in their gloomy Caverns pant  Stern  Neptune  thrice above the Waves upheld  His Face and thrice was by the Flames repell'd  The Earth at length on ev'ry Side embrac'd  With scalding Seas that floated round her Waste  When now she felt the Springs and Rivers come  And crowd within the Hollow of her Womb  Uplifted to the Heav'ns her blasted Head  And clapt her Hand upon her Brows and said  But first impatient of the sultry Heat  Sunk deeper down and sought a cooler Seat  " If you great King of Gods my Death approve  " And I deserve it let me die by  Jove    " If I must perish by the Force of Fire  " Let me transfix'd with Thunderbolts expire  " See whilst I speak my Breath the Vapours choak  For now her Face lay wrapt in Clouds of Smoak  " See my singe'd Hair behold my faded Eye  " And wither'd Face where Heaps of Cinders lye  " And does the Plow for This my Body tear  " This the Reward for all the Fruits I bear  " Tortur'd with Rakes and harrass'd all the Year  " That Herbs for Cattle daily I renew  " And Food for Man and Frankincense for You  "But grant Me guilty what has  Neptune  done  " Why are his Waters boiling in the Sun  " The wavy Empire which by Lot was giv'n  " Why does it waste and further shrink from Heav'n  " If I nor He your Pity can provoke  " See your own Heav'ns the Heav'ns begin to smoke  " Shou'd once the Sparkles catch those bright Abodes  " Destruction seizes on the Heav'ns and Gods  "  Atlas  becomes unequal to his Freight  " And almost faints beneath the glowing Weight  " If Heavn'n and Earth and Sea together burn  " All must again into their Chaos turn  " Apply some speedy Cure prevent our Fate  " And succour Nature e'er it be too late  She ceas'd for choak'd with Vapours round her spread  Down to the deepest Shades she sunk her Head  Jove  call'd to witness ev'ry Pow'r above  And ev'n the God whose Son the Chariot drove  That what he acts he is compell'd to do  Or universal Ruin must ensue  Strait he ascends the high Aethereal Throne  From whence he us'd to dart his Thunder down  From whence his Show'rs and Storms he us'd to pour  But now cou'd meet with neither Storm nor Show'r  Then aiming at the Youth with lifted Hand  Full at his Head he hurl'd the forky Brand  In dreadful Thund'rings Thus th' Almighty Sire  Suppress'd the Raging of the Fires with Fire  At once from Life and from the Chariot driv'n  Th' ambitious Boy fell Thunderstruck from Heav'n  The Horses started with a sudden Bound  And flung the Reins and Chariot to the Ground  The studded Harness from their Necks they broke  Here fell a Wheel and here a Silver Spoke  Here were the Beam and Axle torn away  And scatter'd o'er the Earth the shining Fragments lay  The Breathless  Phaeton  with flaming Hair  Shot from the Chariot like a falling Star  That in a Summer's Ev'ning from the Top  Of Heav'n drops down or seems at least to drop  Till on the  Po  his Blasted Corps was hurl'd  Far from his Country in the Western World  PHAETON's Sisters transform'd into Trees  The  Latian  Nymphs came round him and amaz'd  On the dead Youth transfix'd with Thunder gaz'd  And whilst yet smoaking from the Bolt he lay  His shatter'd Body to a Tomb convey  And o'er the Tomb an Epitaph devise  " Here He who drove the Sun's bright Chariot lies  " His Father's fiery Steeds he cou'd not guide  " But in the glorious Enterprize he dy'd  Apollo  hid his Face and pin'd for Grief  And if the Story may deserve Belief  The Space of One whole Day is said to run  From Morn to wonted Ev'n without a Sun  The burning Ruins with a fainter Ray  Supply the Sun and counterfeit a Day  A Day that still did Nature's Face disclose  This Comfort from the mighty Mischief rose  But  Clymenè  enrag'd with Grief laments  And as her Grief inspires her Passion vents  Wild for her Son and frantick in her Woes  With Hair dishevel'd round the World she goes  To seek wheree'er his Body might be cast  Till on the Borders of the  Po  at last  The Name inscrib'd on the new Tomb appears  The dear dear Name she bathes in flowing Tears  Hangs o'er the Tomb unable to depart  And hugs the Marble to her throbbing Heart  Her Daughters too lament and sigh and mourn  A fruitless Tribute to their Brother's Urn  And beat their naked Bosoms and complain  And call aloud for  Phaeton  in vain  All the long Night their mournful Watch they keep  And all the Day stand round the Tomb and weep  Four times revolving the full Moon return'd  So long the Mother and the Daughters mourn'd  When now the Eldest  Phaethusa  strove  To rest her weary Limbs but cou'd not move  Lampetia  wou'd have help'd her but she found  Her self withheld and rooted to the Ground  A Third in wild Affliction as she grieves  Wou'd rend her Hair but fills her Hand with Leaves  One sees her Thighs transform'd Another views  Her Arms shot out and branching into Boughs  And now their Legs and Breasts and Bodies stood  Crusted with Bark and hard'ning into Wood  But still Above were Female Heads display'd  And Mouths that call'd the Mother to their Aid  What cou'd alas the weeping Mother do  From this to that with eager Haste she flew  And kiss'd her Sprouting Daughters as they grew  She tear's the Bark that to each Body cleaves  And from their verdant Fingers strips the Leaves  The Blood came trickling where she tore away  The Leaves and Bark The Maids were heard to say  " Forbear mistaken Parent Oh forbear  " A wounded Daughter in each Tree you tear  " Farewell for ever" Here the Bark encreas'd  Clos'd on their Faces and their Words suppress'd  The newmade Trees in Tears of Amber run  Which harden'd into Value by the Sun  Distill for ever on the Streams below  The limpid Streams their radiant Treasure show  Mixt in the Sand whence the rich Drops convey'd  Shine in the Dress of the bright  Latian  Maid  The Transformation of CYCNUS into a Swan  Cycnus  beheld the Nymphs transform'd ally'd  To their dead Brother on the Mortal Side  In Friendship and Affection nearer bound  He left the Cities and the Realms he own'd  Thro' pathless Fields and lonely Shores to range  And Woods made Thicker by the Sisters Change▪  Whilst here within the dismal Gloom alone  The melancholy Monarch made his Moan  His Voice was lessen'd as he try'd to speak  And issu'd through a long extended Neck  His Hair transforms to Down his Fingers meet  In skinny Films and shape his oary Feet  From both his Sides the Wings and Feathers break  And from his Mouth proceeds a blunted Beak  All  Cycnus  now into a Swan was turn'd  Who still remembring how his Kinsman burn'd  To solitary Pools and Lakes retires  And loves the Waters as oppos'd to Fires  Meanwhile  Apollo  in a gloomy Shade  The native Lustre of his Brows decay'd  Indulging Sorrow sickens at the Sight  Of his own Sunshine and abhors the Light  The hidden Griefs that in his Bosom rise  Sadden his Looks and overcast his Eyes  As when some dusky Orb obstructs his Ray  And sullies in a Dim Eclipse the Day  Now secretly with inward Griefs he pin'd  Now warm Resentments to his Griefs he joyn'd  And now renounc'd his Office to Mankind  " E'er since the Birth of Time said he I've born  " A long ungrateful Toil without Return  " Let now some Other manage if he dare  " The fiery Steeds and mount the burning Carr  " Of if none else let  Jove  his Fortune try  " And learn to lay his murd'ring Thunder by  " Then will he own perhaps but own too late  " My Son deserv'd not so severe a Fate  The Gods stand round him as he mourns and pray  He would resume the Conduct of the Day  Nor let the World be lost in endless Night  Jove  too himself descending from his Height  Excuses what had happen'd and intreats  Majestically mixing Pray'rs and Threats  Prevail'd upon at length again he took  The harness'd Steeds that still with Horror shook  And plies 'em with the Lash and whips 'em on  And as he whips upbraids 'em with his Son  The Story of CALISTO  The Day was settled in its Course and  Jove  Walk'd the wide Circuit of the Heav'ns above  To search if any Cracks or Flaws were made  But all was Safe The Earth he then survey'd  And cast an Eye on ev'ry diff'rent Coast  And ev'ry Land but on  Arcadia  most  Her Fields he cloath'd and chear'd her blasted Face  With running Fountains and with springing Grass  No Tracks of Heav'ns destructive Fire remain  The Fields and Woods revive and Nature smiles again  But as the God walk'd to and fro the Earth  And rais'd the Plants and gave the Spring its Birth  By Chance a fair  Arcadian  Nymph he view'd  And felt the lovely Charmer in his Blood  The Nymph nor Spun nor dress'd with artful Pride  Her Vest was gather'd up her Hair was ty'd  Now in her Hand a slender Spear she bore  Now a light Quiver on her Shoulders wore  To chaste  Diana  from her Youth inclin'd  The sprightly Warriors of the Wood she joyn'd  Diana  too the gentle Huntress lov'd  Nor was there One of all the Nymphs that rov'd  O'er  Maenalus  amid the Maiden Throng  More favour'd once but Favour lasts not long  The Sun now shone in all its Strength and drove  The heated Virgin panting to a Grove  The Grove around a grateful Shadow cast  She dropt her Arrows and her Bow unbrac'd  She flung her self on the cool grassy Bed  And on the painted Quiver rais'd her Head  Jove  saw the charming Huntress unprepar'd  Stretch'd on the verdant Turf without a Guard  " Here I am safe he cries from  Juno  's Eye  " Or shou'd my jealous Queen the Theft descry  " Yet wou'd I venture on a Theft like This  " And stand her Rage for such for such a Bliss  Diana  's Shape and Habit strait he took  Soften'd his Brows and smooth'd his awful Look  And mildly in a Female Accent spoke  " How fares my Girl How went the Morning Chase  To whom the Virgin starting from the Grass  " Allhail bright Deity whom I prefer  " To  Jove  himself tho'  Jove  himself were here  The God was nearer than she thought and heard  Wellpleas'd Himself before Himself prefer'd  He then salutes her with a warm Embrace  And e're she half had told the Morning Chase  With Love enflam'd and eager on his Bliss  Smother'd her Words and stop'd her with a Kiss  His Kisses with unwonted Ardour glow'd  Nor cou'd  Diana  's Shape conceal the God  The Virgin did whate'er a Virgin cou'd  Sure  Juno  must have pardon'd had she view'd  With all her Might against his Force she strove  But how can mortal Maids contend with  Jove  Possest at length of what his Heart desir'd  Back to his Heav'ns th' exulting God retir'd  The lovely Huntress rising from the Grass  With downcast Eyes and with a blushing Face  By Shame confounded and by Fear dismay'd  Flew from the Covert of the guilty Shade  And almost in the Tumult of her Mind  Lest her forgotten Bow and Shafts behind  But now  Diana  with a sprightly Train  Of quiver'd Virgins bounding o'er the Plain  Call'd to the Nymph the Nymph began to fear  A second Fraud a  Jove  disguis'd in Her  But when she saw the Sister Nymphs suppress'd  Her rising Fears and mingled with the rest  How in the Look does conscious Guilt appear  Slowly she mov'd and loiter'd in the Rear  Nor lightly tripp'd nor by the Goddess ran  As once she us'd the foremost of the Train  Her Looks were flush'd and sullen was her Mien  That sure the Virgin Goddess had she been  Aught but a Virgin must the Guilt have seen  'Tis said the Nymphs saw all and guess'd aright  And now the Moon had nine times lost her Light  When  Dian  fainting in the midday Beams  Found a cool Covert and refreshing Streams  That in soft Murmurs through the Forest flow'd  And a smooth Bed of shining Gravel show'd  A Covert so obscure and Streams so clear  The Goddess prais'd " And now no Spies are near  " Let's strip my gentle Maids and wash she cries  Pleas'd with the Motion ev'ry Maid complies  Only the blushing Huntress stood confus'd  And form'd Delays and her Delays excus'd  In vain excus'd her Fellows round her press'd  And the Reluctant Nymph by Force undress'd  The Naked Huntress all her Shame reveal'd  In vain her Hands the pregnant Womb conceal'd  " Begone the Goddess cries with stern Disdain  " Begone nor dare the hallow'd Stream to stain  She fled forever Banish'd from the Train  This  Juno  heard who long had watch'd her Time  To punish the detested Rival's Crime  The Time was come for to enrage her more  A lovely Boy the teeming Rival bore  The Goddess cast a furious Look and cry'd  " It is enough I'm Fully satisfy'd  " This Boy shall stand a living Mark to prove  " My Husband's Baseness and the Strumpet's Love  " But Vengeance shall Awake those guilty Charms  " That drew the Thunderer from  Juno  's Arms  " No longer shall their wonted Force retain  " Nor please the God nor make the Mortal vain  This said her Hand within her Hair she wound  Swung her to Earth and drag'd her on the Ground  The prostrate Wretch lifts up her Arms in Pray'r  Her Arms grow shaggy and deform'd with Hair  Her Nails are sharpen'd into pointed Claws  Her Hands bear Half her Weight and turn to Paws  Her Lips that once cou'd tempt a God begin  To grow distorted in an ugly Grin  And lest the supplicating Brute might reach  The Ears of  Jove  she was depriv'd of Speech  Her surly Voice thro' a hoarse Passage came  In savage Sounds her Mind was still the same  The Furry Monster fix'd her Eyes above  And heav'd her new unwieldy Paws to  Jove    And beg'd his Aid with inward Groans and tho'  She could not call him False she thought him so  How did she fear to lodge in Woods alone  And haunt the Fields and Meadows once her own  How often wou'd the deepmouth'd Dogs pursue  Whilst from her Hounds the frighted Huntress flew  How did she fear her FellowBrutes and shun  The shaggy Bear tho' now her self was one  How from the Sight of rugged Wolves retire  Although the grim  Lycaon  was her Sire  But now her Son had fifteen Summers told  Fierce at the Chase and in the Forest Bold  When as he beat the Woods in quest of Prey  He chanc'd to rouze his Mother where she lay  She knew her Son and kept him in her Sight  And fondly gaz'd The Boy was in a Fright  And aim'd a pointed Arrow at her Breast  And would have slain his Mother in the Beast  But  Jove  forbad and snatch'd 'em through the Air  In Whirlwinds up to Heav'n and fix'd 'em there  Where the new Constellations nightly rise  And add a Lustre to the Northern Skies  When  Juno  saw the Rival in her Height  Spangled with Stars and circled round with Light  She sought Old  Ocean  in his deep Abodes  And  Tethys  both Rever'd among the Gods  They ask what brings her there " Ne'er ask says she  " What brings me here Heav'n is no Place for Me  " You'll see when Night has cover'd all things o'er  "  Jove  's starry Bastard and triumphant Whore  " Usurp the Heav'ns You'll see 'em proudly roul  " In their new Orbs and brighten all the Pole  " And who shall now on  Juno  's Altars wait  " When Those she hates grow Greater by her Hate  " I on the Nymph a Brutal Form impress'd  "  Jove  to a Goddess has transform'd the Beast  " This This was all my weak Revenge could do  " But let the God his chaste Amours pursue  "And as he acted after  Io  's Rape  " Restore th' Adultress to her former Shape  " Then may he cast his  Juno  off and lead  " The great  Lycaon  's Offspring to his Bed  " But you ye venerable Pow'rs be kind  " And if my Wrongs a due Resentment find  " Receive not in your Waves their Setting Beams  " Nor let the glaring Strumpet taint your Streams  The Goddess ended and her Wish was giv'n  Back she return'd in Triumph up to Heav'n  Her gawdy Peacocks drew her through the Skies  Their Tails were Spotted with a thousand Eyes  The Eyes of  Argus  on their Tails were rang'd  At the same time the Raven's Colour chang'd  The Story of CORONIS and Birth of AESCULAPIUS  The Raven once in Snowy Plumes was drest  White as the whitest Dove's unsully'd Breast  Fair as the Guardian of the Capitol  Soft as the Swan a large and lovely Fowl  His Tongue his prating Tongue had chang'd him quite  To sooty Blackness from the purest White  The Story of his Change shall here be told  In  Thessaly  there liv'd a Nymph of old  Coronis  nam'd a peerless Maid she hins'd  Confest the Fairest of the fairer Kind  Apollo  lov'd her till her Guilt he knew  While true she was or whilst he thought her true  But his own Bird the Raven chanc'd to find  The false one with a secret Rival joyn'd  Coronis  begg'd him to suppress the Tale  But could not with repeated Pray'rs prevail  His milkwhite Pinions to the God he ply'd  The busy Daw flew with him Side by Side  And by a thousand teizing Questions drew  Th' important Secret from him as they flew  The Daw gave honest Counsel tho' despis'd  And tedious in her Tattle thus advis'd  " Stay silly Bird th'illnatur'd Task refuse  " Nor be the Bearer of unwelcome News  " Be warn'd by My Example you discern  " What now I am and what I was shall learn  " My foolish Honesty was all my Crime  " Then hear my Story Once upon a Time  " The twoshap'd  Ericthonius  had his Birth  " Without a Mother from the teeming Earth  "  Minerva  nurs'd him and the Infant laid  " Within a Chest of twining Osiers made  " The Daughters of King  Cecrops  undertook  " To guard the Chest commanded not to look  " On what was hid within I stood to see  " The Charge obey'd perch'd on a neighb'ring Tree  " The Sisters  Pandrosos  and  Hersè  keep  " This strict Command  Aglauros  needs would Peep  " And saw the monstrous Infant in a Fright  " And call'd her Sisters to the hideous Sight  " A Boy's soft Shape did to the Waste prevail  " But the Boy ended in a Dragon's Tail  " I told the stern  Minerva  all that pass'd  " But for my Pains discarded and disgrac'd  " The frowning Goddess drove me from her Sight  " And for her Fav'rite chose the Bird of Night  " Be then no TellTale for I think my Wrong  " Enough to teach a Bird to hold her Tongue  "But you perhaps may think I was remov'd  " As never by the heav'nly Maid belov'd  " But I was lov'd ask  Pallas  if I lye  " Tho'  Pallas  hate me now she won't deny  " For I whom in a feather'd Shape you view  " Was once a Maid by Heav'n the Story's true  " A blooming Maid and a King's Daughter too  " A Crowd of Lovers own'd my Beauty's Charms  " My Beauty was the Cause of all my Harms  "  Neptune  as on his Shores I wont to rove  " Observ'd me in my Walks and fell in Love  " He made his Courtship he confess'd his Pain  " And offer'd Force when all his Arts were vain  " Swift he pursu'd I ran along the Strand  " Till spent and weary'd on the sinking Sand  " I shriek'd aloud with Cries I fill'd the Air  " To Gods and Men nor God nor Man was there  " A Virgin Goddess heard a Virgin's Pray'r  " For as my Arms I lifted to the Skies  " I saw Black Feathers from my Fingers rise  " I strove to fling my Garment on the Ground  " My Garment turn'd to Plumes and girt me round  " My Hands to beat my naked Bosom try  " Nor naked Bosom now nor Hands had I  " Lightly I tript nor weary as before  " Sunk in the Sand but skim'd along the Shore  " Till rising on my Wings I was prefer'd  " To be the chaste  Minerva  's Virgin Bird  " Prefer'd in vain I now am in Disgrace  "  Nyctimene  the Owl enjoys my Place  " On Her incestuous Life I need not dwell  " In  Lesbos  still the horrid Tale they tell  "And of her dire Amours you must have heard  " For which she now does Penance in a Bird  " That conscious of her Shame avoids the Light  " And loves the gloomy Cov'ring of the Night  " The Birds wheree'er she flutters scare away  " The Hooting wretch and drive her from the Day  The Raven urg'd by such Impertinence  Grew Passionate it seems and took Offence  And curst the harmless Daw the Daw withdrew  The Raven to her injur'd Patron flew  And found him out and told the fatal Truth  Of false  Coronis  and the favour'd Youth  The God was wroth the Colour left his Look  The Wreath his Head the Harp his Hand forsook  His Silver Bow and feather'd Shafts he took  And lodg'd an Arrow in the tender Breast  That had so often to his own been prest  Down fell the wounded Nymph and sadly groan'd  And pull'd his Arrow reeking from the Wound  And weltring in her Blood thus faintly cry'd  " Ah cruel God tho' I have justly dy'd  " What has alas my unborn Infant done  " That He should fall and Two expire in One  This said in Agonies she fetch'd her Breath  The God dissolves in Pity at her Death  He hates the Bird that made her Falshood known  And hates himself for what himself had done  The feather'd Shaft that sent her to the Fates  And his own Hand that sent the Shaft he hates  Fain would he heal the Wound and case her Pain  And tries the Compass of his Art in vain  Soon as he saw the lovely Nymph expire  The Pile made ready and the kindling Fire  With Sighs and Groans her Obsequies he kept  And if a God could weep the God had wept  Her Corps he kiss'd and heav'nly Incense brought  And solemniz'd the Death Himself had wrought  But lest his Offspring should her Fate partake  Spight of th'Immortal Mixture in his Make  He ript her Womb and set the Child at large  And gave him to the Centaur  Chiron  's Charge  Then in his Fury Black'd the Raven o'er  And bid him Prate in his White plumes no more  OCYRRHOE transform'd to a Mare  Old  Chiron  took the Babe with secret Joy  Proud of the Charge of the Celestial Boy  His Daughter too whom on the sandy Shore  The Nymph  Chariclo  to the Centaur bore  With Hair dishevel'd on her Shoulders came  To see the Child  Ocyrrhoe  was her Name  She knew her Father's Arts and could rehearse  The Depths of Prophecy in sounding Verse  Once as the sacred Infant she survey'd  The God was kindled in the raving Maid  And thus she utter'd her Prophetick Tale  " Hail great Physician of the World Allhail  " Hail mighty Infant who in Years to come  " Shalt heal the Nations and defraud the Tomb  " Swift be thy Growth thy Triumphs unconfin'd  " Make Kingdoms thicker and increase Mankind  " Thy daring Art shall animate the Dead  " And draw the Thunder on thy guilty Head  "Then shalt thou dye but from the dark Abode  " Rise up Victorious and be Twice a God  " And Thou my Sire not destin'd by thy Birth  " To turn to Dust and mix with common Earth  " How wilt thou toss and rave and long to dye  " And quit thy Claim to Immortality  " When thou shalt feel enrag'd with inward Pains  " The  Hydra  's Venom rankling in thy Veins  " The Gods in Pity shall contract thy Date  " And give thee over to the Pow'r of Fate  Thus ent'ring into Destiny the Maid  The Secrets of offended  Jove  betray'd  More had she still to say but now appears  Oppress'd with Sobs and Sighs and drown'd in Tears  " My Voice says she is gone my Language fails  " Through ev'ry Limb my kindred Shape prevails  " Why did the God this fatal Gift impart  " And with prophetick Raptures swell my Heart  " What new Desires are these I long to pace  " O'er flow'ry Meadows and to feed on Grass  " I hasten to a Brute a Maid no more  " But why alas am I transform'd all o'er  " My Sire does Half a human Shape retain  " And in his upper Parts preserves the Man  Her Tongue no more distinct Complaints affords  But in shrill Accents and misshapen Words  Pours forth such hideous Wailings as declare  The Human Form confounded in the Mare  Till by degrees accomplish'd in the Beast  She neigh'd outright and all the Steed exprest  Her stooping Body on her Hands is born  Her Hands are turn'd to Hoofs and shod in Horn  Her yellow Tresses ruffle in a Mane  And in a flowing Tail she frisks her Train  The Mare was finish'd in her Voice and Look  And a new Name from the new Figure took  The Transformation of BATTUS to a Touchstone  Sore wept the Centaur and to  Phoebus  pray'd  But how could  Phoebus  give the Centaur Aid  Degraded of his Pow'r by angry  Jove    In  Elis  Then a Herd of Beeves he drove  And wielded in his Hand a Staff of Oak  And o'er his Shoulders threw the Shepherd's Cloak  On sev'n compacted Reeds he us'd to play  And on his Rural Pipe to waste the Day  As once attentive to his Pipe he play'd  The crafty  Hermes  from the God convey'd  A Drove that sep'rate from their Fellows stray'd  The Theft an old insidious Peasant view'd  They call'd him  Battus  in the Neighbourhood  Hir'd by a wealthy  Pylian  Prince to feed  His fav'rite Mares and watch the gen'rous Breed  The thievish God suspected him and took  The Hind aside and thus in Whispers spoke  " Discover not the Theft whoe'er thou be  " And take that milkwhite Heifer for thy Fee  " Go Stranger cries the Clown securely on  " That Stone shall sooner tell and show'd a Stone  The God withdrew but strait return'd again  In Speech and Habit like a Country Swain  And cries out " Neighbour hast thou seen a Stray  " Of Bullocks and of Heifers pass this Way  "In the Recov'ry of my Cattle join  " A Bullock and a Heifer shall be thine  The Peasant quick replies " You'll find 'em there  " In yon dark Vale and in the Vale they were  The Double Bribe had his false Heart beguil'd  The God successful in the Tryal smil'd  " And dost thou thus betray my self to Me  " Me to my self dost thou betray says he  Then to a  Touchstone  turns the faithless Spy  And in his Name records his Infamy  The Story of AGLAUROS transform'd into a Statue  This done the God flew up on high and pass'd  O'er lofty  Athens  by  Minerva  grac'd  And wide  Munichia  whilst his Eyes survey  All the vast Region that beneath him lay  'Twas now the Feast when each  Athenian  Maid  Her yearly Homage to  Minerva  paid  In Canisters with Garlands cover'd o'er  High on their Heads their mystick Gifts they bore  And now returning in a solemn Train  The Troop of shining Virgins fill'd the Plain  The God wellpleas'd beheld the pompous Show  And saw the bright Procession pass below  Then veer'd about and took a wheeling Flight  And hover'd o'er them As the spreading Kite  That smells the slaughter'd Victim from on high  Flies at a Distance if the Priests are nigh  And sails around and keeps it in her Eye  So kept the God the Virgin Quire in view  And in slow winding Circles round them flew  As  Lucifer  excells the meanest Star  Or as the fullorb'd  Phoebe Lucifer    So much did  Hersè  all the rest outvy  And gave a Grace to the Solemnity  Hermes  was fir'd as in the Clouds he hung  So the cold Bullet that with Fury slung  From  Balearick  Engines mounts on high  Glows in the Whirl and burns along the Sky  At length he pitch'd upon the Ground and show'd  The Form Divine the Features of a God  He knew their Vertue o'er a Female Heart  And yet he strives to better them by Art  He hangs his Mantle loose and sets to show  The golden Edging on the Seam below  Adjusts his flowing Curls and in his Hand  Waves with an Air the Sleepprocuring Wand  The glitt'ring Sandals to his Feet applies  And to each Heel the well trim'd Pinion ties  His Ornaments with nicest Art display'd  He seeks th' Apartment of the Royal Maid  The Roof was all with polish'd Iv'ry lin'd  That richly mix'd in Clouds of Tortoise shin'd  Three Rooms contiguous in a Range were plac'd  The Midmost by the beauteous  Hersè  grac'd  Her Virgin Sisters lodg'd on either Side  Aglauros  first th' approaching God descry'd  And as he cross'd her Chamber ask'd his Name  And what his Business was and whence he came  " I come reply'd the God from Heav'n to woo  " Your Sister and to make an Aunt of you  " I am the Son and Messenger of  Jove    " My Name is  Mercury  my Bus'ness Love  "Do you kind Damsel take a Lover's Part  " And gain Admittance to your Sister's Heart  She star'd him in the Face with Looks amaz'd  As when she on  Minerva  's Secret gaz'd  And asks a mighty Treasure for her Hire  And till he brings it makes the God retire  Minerva  griev'd to see the Nymph succeed  And now remembring the late impious Deed  When disobedient to her strict Command  She touch'd the Chest with an unhallow'd Hand  In bigswoln Sighs her inward Rage express'd  That heav'd the rising  Aegis  on her Breast  Then sought out  Envy  in her dark Abode  Defil'd with ropy Gore and Clots of Blood  Shut from the Winds and from the wholesome Skies  In a deep Vale the gloomy Dungeon lies  Dismal and Cold where not a Beam of Light  Invades the Winter or disturbs the Night  Directly to the Cave her Course she steer'd  Against the Gates her martial Lance she rear'd  The Gates flew open and the Fiend appear'd  A pois'nous Morsel in her Teeth she chew'd  And gorg'd the Flesh of Vipers for her Food  Minerva  loathing turn'd away her Eye  The hideous Monster rising Heavily  Came stalking forward with a sullen Pace  And left her mangled Offals on the Place  Soon as she saw the Goddess gay and bright  She fetch'd a Groan at such a chearful Sight  Livid and meagre were her Looks her Eye  In foul distorted Glances turn'd awry  A Hoard of Gall her inward Parts possess'd  And spread a Greenness o'er her canker'd Breast  Her Teeth were brown with Rust and from her Tongue  In dangling Drops the stringy Poison hung  She never smiles but when the Wretched weep  Nor lulls her Malice with a Moment's Sleep  Restless in Spite while watchful to destroy  She pines and sickens at Another's Joy  Foe to her self distressing and distrest  She bears her own Tormenter in her Breast  The Goddess gave for she abhorr'd her Sight  A short Command " To  Athens  speed thy Flight  " On curst  Aglauros  try thy utmost Art  " And fix thy rankest Venoms in her Heart  This said her Spear she push'd against the Ground  And mounting from it with an active Bound  Flew off to Heav'n The Hag with Eyes askew  Look'd up and mutter'd Curses as she flew  For sore she fretted and began to grieve  At the Success which she her self must give  Then takes her Staff hung round with Wreaths of Thorn  And sails along in a black Whirlwind born  O'er Fields and flow'ry Meadows Where she steers  Her banesul Course a mighty Blast appears  Mildews and Blights the Meadows are defac'd  The Fields the Flow'rs and the whole Year laid waste  On Mortals next and peopled Towns she falls  And breathes a burning Plague among their Walls  When  Athens  she beheld for Arts renown'd  With Peace made happy and with Plenty crown'd  Scarce could the hideous Fiend from Tears forbear  To find out nothing that Deserv'd a Tear  Th' Apartment now she enter'd where at rest  Aglauros  lay with gentle Sleep opprest  To execute  Minerva  's dire Command  She stroak'd the Virgin with her canker'd Hand  Then prickly Thorns into her Breast convey'd  That stung to Madness the devoted Maid  Her subtle Venom still improves the Smart  Frets in the Blood and festers in the Heart  To make the Work more sure a Scene she drew  And plac'd before the dreaming Virgin's View  Her Sister's Marriage and her glorious Fate  Th' imaginary Bride appears in State  The Bridegroom with unwonted Beauty glows  For Envy Magnifies whate'er she shows  Full of the Dream  Aglauros  pin'd away  In Tears all Night in Darkness all the Day  Consum'd like Ice that just Begins to run  When feebly smitten by the distant Sun  Or like unwholsome Weeds that set on Fire  Are slowly wasted and in Smoke expire  Giv'n up to Envy for in ev'ry Thought  The Thorns the Venom and the Vision wrought  Oft did she call on Death as oft decreed  Rather than see her Sister's Wish succeed  To tell her awfull Father what had past  At length before the Door her self she cast  And sitting on the Ground with sullen Pride  A Passage to the Lovesick God deny'd  The God caress'd and for Admission pray'd  And sooth'd in softest Words th' envenom'd Maid  In vain he sooth'd " Begone the Maid replies  " Or here I keep my Seat and never rise  " Then keep thy Seat for ever cries the God  And touch'd the Door wideop'ning to his Rod  Fain would she rise and stop him but she found  Her Trunk too heavy to forsake the Ground  Her Joynts are all benum'd her Hands are pale  And Marble now appears in ev'ry

taken Vengeance of the stubborn Maid  From where the bright  Athenian  Turrets rise  He mounts aloft and reascends the Skies  Jove  saw him enter the sublime Abodes  And as he mix'd among the Crowd of Gods  Beckon'd him out and drew him from the Rest  And in soft Whispers thus his Will exprest  " My trusty  Hermes  by who's Ready Aid  " Thy Sire's Commands are through the World convey'd  " Resume thy Wings exert their utmost Force  " And to the Walls of  Sidon  speed thy Course  " There find a Herd of Heifers wandring o'er  " The neighb'ring Hill and drive 'em to the Shore  Thus spoke the God concealing his Intent  The trusty  Hermes  on his Message went  And found the Herd of Heifers wandring o'er  A neighb'ring Hill and drove 'em to the Shore  Where the King's Daughter with a lovely

Daughter lost  He sent his Son to search on ev'ry Coast  And sternly bid him to his Arms restore  The Darling Maid or see his Face no more  But live an Exile in a foreign Clime  Thus was the Father Pious to a Crime  The restless Youth search'd all the World around  But how can  Jove  in his Amours be found  When tir'd at length with unsuccessful Toil  To shun his angry Sire and Native Soil  He goes a Suppliant to the  Delphick  Dome  There asks the God what newappointed Home  Should end his Wandrings and his Toils relieve  The  Delphick  Oracles this Answer give  " Behold among the Fields a lonely Cow  " Unworn with Yokes unbroken to the Plow  "Mark well the Place where first she lays her down  " There measure out thy Walls and build thy Town  " And from thy Guide  Baeotia  call the Land  " In which the destin'd Walls and Town shall stand  No sooner had he left the dark Abode  Big with the Promise of the  Delphick  God  When in the Fields the fatal Cow he view'd  Nor gall'd with Yokes nor worn with Servitude  Her gently at a Distance he pursu'd  And as he walk'd aloof in Silence pray'd  To the great Pow'r whose Counsels he obey'd  Her Way through flow'ry  Panopè  she took  And now  Cephisus  cross'd thy Silver Brook  When to the Heav'ns her spacious Front she rais'd  And bellow'd thrice then backward turning gaz'd  On those behind till on the destin'd Place  She stoop'd and couch'd amid the rising Grass  Cadmus  salutes the Soil and gladly hails  The newfound Mountains and the nameless Vales  And thanks the Gods and turns about his Eye  To see his new Dominions round him lye  Then sends his Servants to a neighb'ring Grove  For living Streams a Sacrifice to  Jove  O'er the wide Plain there rose a shady Wood  Of aged Trees in its dark Bosom stood  A bushy Thicket pathless and unworn  O'errun with Brambles and perplex'd with Thorn  Amidst the Brake a hollow Den was found  With Rocks and shelving Arches vaulted round  Deep in the dreary Den conceal'd from Day  Sacred to  Mars  a mighty Dragon lay  Bloated with Poison to a monstrous Size  Fire broke in Flashes when he glanc'd his Eyes  His tow'ring Crest was glorious to behold  His Shoulders and his Sides were scal'd with Gold  Three Tongues he brandish'd when he charg'd his Foes  His Teeth stood jaggy in Three dreadful Rows  The  Tyrians  in the Den for Water sought  And with their Urns explor'd the hollow Vault  From Side to Side their empty Urns rebound  And rowse the sleeping Serpent with the Sound  Strait he bestirs him and is seen to rise  And now with dreadful Hissings fills the Skies  And darts his forky Tongues and rouls his glareing Eyes  The  Tyrians  drop their Vessels in the Fright  All pale and trembling at the hideous Sight  Spire above Spire uprear'd in Air he stood  And gazing round him overlook'd the Wood  Then floating on the Ground in Circles rowl'd  Then leap'd upon them in a mighty Fold  Of such a Bulk and such a monst'rous Size  The Serpent in the Polar Circle lyes  That stretches over half the Northern Skies  In vain the  Tyrians  on their Arms rely  In vain attempt to fight in vain to fly  All their Endeavours and their Hopes are vain  Some die entangl'd in the winding Train  Some are devour'd or feel a loathsom Death  Swoln up with Blasts of Pestilential Breath  And now the scorching Sun was mounted high  In all its Lustre to the Noonday Sky  When anxious for his Friends and fill'd with Cares  To search the Woods th' impatient Chief prepares  A Lion's Hide around his Loins he wore  The wellpoiz'd Jav'lin to the Field he bore  Inur'd to Blood the fardestroying Dart  And the best Weapon an undaunted Heart  Soon as the Youth approach'd the fatal Place  He saw his Servants breathless on the Grass  The scaly Foe amid their Corps he view'd  Basking at Ease and feasting in their Blood  " Such Friends he cries deserv'd a longer Date  " But  Cadmus  will revenge or share their Fate  Then heav'd a Stone and rising to the Throw  He sent it in a Whirlwind at the Foe  A Tow'r assaulted by so rude a Stroke  With all its lofty Battlements had shook  But nothing here th' unweildy Rock avails  Rebounding harmless from the plaited Scales  That firmly join'd preserv'd him from a Wound  With native Armour crusted all around  The pointed Jav'lin more successful flew  Which at his Back the raging Warriour threw  Amid the plaited Scales it took its Course  And in the spinal Marrow spent its Force  The Monster hiss'd aloud and rag'd in vain  And writh'd his Body to and fro with Pain  And bit the Spear and wrench'd the Wood away  The Point still buried in the Marrow lay  And now his Rage increasing with his Pain  Reddens his Eyes and beats in ev'ry Vein  Churn'd in his Teeth the foamy Venom rose  Whilst from his Mouth a Blast of Vapours flows  Such as th' Infernal  Stygian  Waters cast  The Plants around him wither in the Blast  Now in a Maze of Rings he lies enrowl'd  Now all unravel'd and without a Fold  Now like a Torrent with a mighty Force  Bears down the Forest in his boist'rous Course  Cadmus  gave back and on the Lion's Spoil  Sustain'd the Shock then forc'd him to recoil  The pointed Jav'lin warded off his Rage  Mad with his Pains and furious to engage  The Serpent champs the Steel and bites the Spear  'Till Blood and Venom all the Point besmear  But still the Hurt he yet receiv'd was slight  For whilst the Champion with redoubled Might  Strikes home the Jav'lin his retiring Foe  Shrinks from the Wound and disappoints the Blow  The dauntless Heroe still pursues his Stroke  And presses forward 'till a knotty Oak  Retards his Foe and stops him in the Rear  Full in his Throat he plung'd the fatal Spear  That in th' extended Neck a Passage found  And pierc'd the solid Timber through the Wound  Fix'd to the reeling Trunk with many a Stroke  Of his huge Tail he lash'd the sturdy Oak  Till spent with Toil and lab'ring hard for Breath  He now lay twisting in the Pangs of Death  Cadmus  beheld him wallow in a Flood  Of swimming Poison intermix'd with Blood  When suddenly a Speech was heard from high  The Speech was heard nor was the Speaker nigh  " Why dost thou thus with secret Pleasure see  " Insulting Man what thou thy self shalt be  Astonish'd at the Voice he stood amaz'd  And all around with inward Horror gaz'd  When  Pallas  swift descending from the Skies  Pallas  the Guardian of the Bold and Wise  Bids him plow up the Field and scatter round  The Dragon's Teeth o'er all the furrow'd Ground  Then tells the Youth how to his wond'ring Eyes  Embattled Armies from the Field should rise  He sows the Teeth at  Pallas  's Command  And flings the future People from his Hand  The Clods grow warm and crumble where he sows  And now the pointed Spears advance in Rows  Now nodding Plumes appear and shining Crests  Now the broad Shoulders and the rising Breasts  O'er all the Field the breathing Harvest swarms  A growing Host a Crop of Men and Arms  So through the parting Stage a Figure rears  Its Body up and Limb by Limb appears  By just Degrees 'till all the Man arise  And in his full Proportion strikes the Eyes  Cadmus  surpriz'd and startled at the Sight  Of his new Foes prepar'd himself for Fight  When one cry'd out " Forbear fond Man forbear  " To mingle in a blind promiscuous War  This said he struck his Brother to the Ground  Himself expiring by another's Wound  Nor did the Third his Conquest long survive  Dying e'er scarce he had begun to live  The dire Example ran through all the Field  'Till Heaps of Brothers were by Brothers kill'd  The Furrows swam in Blood and only five  Of all the vast Increase were left alive  Echion  One at  Pallas  's Command  Let fall the guiltless Weapon from his Hand  And with the rest a peaceful Treaty makes  Whom  Cadmus  as his Friends and Partners takes  So founds a City on the promis'd Earth  And gives his new  Baeotian  Empire Birth  Here  Cadmus  reign'd and now one would have guess't  The Royal Founder in his Exile blest  Long did he live within his new Abodes  Ally'd by Marriage to the deathless Gods  And in a fruitful Wife's Embraces old  A long Increase of Children's Children told  But no frail Man however great or high  Can be concluded blest before he die  Actaeon  was the first of all his Race  Who griev'd his Grandsire in his borrow'd Face  Condemn'd by stern  Diana  to bemoan  The branching Horns and Visage not his own  To shun his oncelov'd Dogs to bound away  And from their Huntsman to become their Prey  And yet consider why the Change was wrought  You'll find it his Misfortune not his Fault  Or if a Fault it was the Fault of Chance  For how can Guilt proceed from Ignorance  The Transformation of ACTAEON into a Stag  In a fair Chace a shady Mountain stood  Well stor'd with Game and mark'd with Trails of Blood  Here did the Huntsmen 'till the Heat of Day  Pursue the Stag and load themselves with Prey  When thus  Actaeon  calling to the rest  " My Friends says he our Sport is at the best  " The Sun is high advanc'd and downward sheds  " His burning Beams directly on our Heads  " Then by Consent abstain from further Spoils  " Call off the Dogs and gather up the Toiles  "And e'er to Morrow's Sun begins his Race  " Take the cool Morning to renew the Chace  They all consent and in a chearful Train  The jolly Huntsmen loaden with the Slain  Return in Triumph from the sultry Plain  Down in a Vale with Pine and Cypress clad  Refresh'd with gentle Winds and brown with Shade  The chaste  Diana  's private Haunt there stood  Full in the Centre of the darksome Wood  A spacious Grotto all around o'ergrown  With hoary Moss and arch'd with Pumicestone  From out its rocky Clefts the Waters flow  And trickling swell into a Lake below  Nature had ev'ry where so plaid her Part  That ev'ry where she seem'd to vie with Art  Here the bright Goddess toil'd and chaf'd with Heat  Was wont to bathe her in the cool Retreat  Here did she now with all her Train resort  Panting with Heat and breathless from the Sport  Her Armourbearer laid her Bow aside  Some loos'd her Sandals some her Veil unty'd  Each busy Nymph her proper Part undrest  While  Crocale  more Handy than the rest  Gather'd her flowing Hair and in a Noose  Bound it together whilst her own hung loose  Five of the more ignoble sort by turns  Fetch up the Water and unlade their Urns  Now all undrest the shining Goddess stood  When young  Actaeon  wilder'd in the Wood  To the cool Grott by his hard Fate betray'd  The Fountains fill'd with naked Nymphs survey'd  The frighted Virgins shrick'd at the Surprize  The Forest echo'd with their piercing Cries  Then in a Huddle round their Goddess prest  She proudly eminent above the rest  With Blushes glow'd such Blushes as adorn  The ruddy Welkin or the purple Morn  And tho' the crowding Nymphs her Body hide  Half backward shrunk and view'd him from aside  Surpriz'd at first she would have snatch'd her Bow  But sees the circling Waters round her flow  These in the Hollow of her Hand she took  And dash'd 'em in his Face while thus she spoke  " Tell if thou can'st the wond'rous Sight disclos'd  " A Goddess naked to thy View expos'd  This said the Man begun to disappear  By slow Degrees and ended in a Deer  A rising Horn on either Brow he wears  And stretches out his Neck and pricks his Ears  Rough is his Skin with sudden Hairs o'ergrown  His Bosom pants with Fears before unknown  Transform'd at length he flies away in haste  And wonders why he flies away so fast  But as by Chance within a neighb'ring Brook  He saw his branching Horns and alter'd Look  Wretched  Actaeon  in a doleful Tone  He try'd to speak but only gave a Groan  And as he wept within the watry Glass  He saw the big round Drops with silent Pace  Run trickling down a savage hairy Face  What should he do Or seek his old Abodes  Or herd among the Deer and sculk in Woods  Here Shame dissuades him there his Fear prevails  And each by turns his aking Heart assails  As he thus ponders he behind him spies  His op'ning Hounds and now he hears their Cries  A gen'rous Pack or to maintain the Chace  Or snuff the Vapour from the scented Grass  He bounded off with Fear and swiftly ran  O'er craggy Mountains and the flow'ry Plain  Through Brakes and Thickets forc'd his Way and flew  Through many a Ring where once he did pursue  In vain he oft endeavour'd to proclaim  His new Misfortune and to tell his Name  Nor Voice nor Words the brutal Tongue supplies  From shouting Men and Horns and Dogs he flies  Deafen'd and stunn'd with their promiscuous Cries  When now the fleetest of the Pack that prest  Close at his Heels and sprung before the rest  Had fasten'd on him straight another Pair  Hung on his wounded Haunch and held him there  'Till all the Pack came up and ev'ry Hound  Tore the sad Huntsman grov'ling on the Ground  Who now appear'd but one continu'd Wound  With dropping Tears his bitter Fate he moans  And fills the Mountain with his dying Groans  His Servants with a piteous Look he spies  And turns about his supplicating Eyes  His Servants ignorant of what had chanc'd  With eager Haste and joyful Shouts advanc'd  And call'd their Lord  Actaeon  to the Game  He shook his Head in answer to the Name  He heard but wish'd he had indeed been gone  Or only to have stood a Looker on  But to his Grief he finds himself too near  And feels his rav'nous Dogs with Fury tear  Their wretched Master panting in a Deer  The Birth of BACCHUS  Actae  n  's Suff'rings and  Diana  's Rage  Did all the Thoughts of Men and Gods engage  Some call'd the Evils which  Diana  wrought  Too great and disproportion'd to the Fault  Others again esteem'd  Actaeon  's Woes  Fit for a Virgin Goddess to impose  The Hearers into diff'rent Parts divide  And Reasons are produc'd on either Side  Juno  alone of all that heard the News  Nor would condemn the Goddess nor excuse  She heeded not the Justice of the Deed  But joy'd to see the Race of  Cadmus  bleed  For still she kept  Europa  in her Mind  And for her sake detested all her Kind  Besides to aggravate her Hate she heard  How  Semele  to  Jove  's Embrace preferr'd  Was now grown big with an immortal Load  And carry'd in her Womb a future God  Thus terribly incens'd the Goddess broke  To sudden Fury and abruptly spoke  " Are my Reproaches of so small a Force  " 'Tis time I then pursue another Course  " It is decreed the guilty Wretch shall die  " If I'm indeed the Mistress of the Sky  " If rightly stil'd among the Pow'rs above  " The Wife and Sister of the thund'ring  Jove    " And none can sure a Sister's Right deny  " It is decreed the guilty Wretch shall die  " She boasts an Honour I can hardly claim  " Pregnant she rises to a Mother's Name  "While proud and vain she triumphs in her  Jove    " And shows the glorious Tokens of his Love  " But if I'm still the Mistress of the Skies  " By her own Lover the fond Beauty dies  This said descending in a yellow Cloud  Before the Gates of  Semele  she stood  Old  Beroe  's decrepit Shape she wears  Her wrinkled Visage and her hoary Hairs  Whilst in her trembling Gait she totters on  And learns to tattle in the Nurse's Tone  The Goddess thus disguis'd in Age beguil'd  With pleasing Stories her false FosterChild  Much did she talk of Love and when she came  To mention to the Nymph her Lover's Name  Fetching a Sigh and holding down her Head  " 'Tis well says she if all be true that's said  " But trust me Child I'm much inclin'd to fear  " Some Counterfeit in this your  Jupiter  " Many an honest welldesigning Maid  " Has been by these pretended Gods betray'd  " But if he be indeed the thund'ring  Jove    " Bid him when next he court the Rites of Love  " Descend triumphant from th' Etherial Sky  " In all the Pomp of his Divinity  " Encompas'd round by those Celestial Charms  " With which he fills th' immortal  Juno  's Arms  Th' unwary Nymph ensnar'd with what she said  Desir'd of  Jove  when next he sought her Bed  To grant a certain Gift which she would chuse  " Fear not reply'd the God that I'll refuse  " Whate'er you ask May  Styx  confirm my Voice  " Chuse what you will and you shall have your Choice  "Then says the Nymph when next you seek my Arms  " May you descend in those Celestial Charms  " With which your  Juno  's Bosom you enflame  " And fill with Transport Heav'n's Immortal Dame  The God surpriz'd would fain have stopp'd her Voice  But he had sworn and she had made her Choice  To keep his Promise he ascends and shrowds  His awful Brow in Whirlwinds and in Clouds  Whilst all around in terrible Array  His Thunders rattle and his Light'nings play  And yet the dazzling Lustre to abate  He set not out in all his Pomp and State  Clad in the mildest Light'ning of the Skies  And arm'd with Thunder of the smallest Size  Not those huge Bolts by which the Giants slain  Lay overthrown on the  Phlegrean  Plain  'Twas of a lesser Mould and lighter Weight  They call it Thunder of a SecondRate  For the rough  Cyclops  who by  Jove  's Command  Temper'd the Bolt and turn'd it to his Hand  Work'd up less Flame and Fury in its Make  And quench'd it sooner in the standing Lake  Thus dreadfully adorn'd with Horror bright  Th' illustrious God descending from his Height  Came rushing on her in a Storm of Light  The mortal Dame too feeble to engage  The Light'ning's Flashes and the Thunder's Rage  Consum'd amidst the Glories she desir'd  And in the Terrible Embrace expir'd  But to preserve his Offspring from the Tomb  Jove  took him smoaking from the blasted Womb  And if on ancient Tales we may rely  Inclos'd th' abortive Infant in his Thigh  Here when the Babe had all his Time fulfill'd  Ino  first took him for her FosterChild  Then the  Niseans  in their dark Abode  Nurs'd secretly with Milk the thriving God  The Transformation of TIRESIAS  'Twas now while these Transactions past on Earth  And  Bacchus  thus procur'd a second Birth  When  Jove  dispos'd to lay aside the Weight  Of Publick Empire and the Cares of State  As to his Queen in Nectar Bowls he quaff'd  " In troth says he and as he spoke he laugh'd  " The Sense of Pleasure in the Male is far  " More dull and dead than what you Females share  Juno  the Truth of what was said deny'd  Tiresias  therefore must the Cause decide  For he the Pleasure of each Sex had try'd  It happen'd once within a shady Wood  Two twisted Snakes he in Conjunction view'd  When with his Staff their slimy Folds he broke  And lost his Manhood at the fatal Stroke  But after sev'n revolving Years he view'd  The selfsame Serpents in the selfsame Wood  " And if says he such Virtue in you lye  " That he who dares your slimy Folds untie  " Must change his Kind a second Stroke I'll try  Again he struck the Snakes and stood again  NewSex'd and strait recover'd into Man  Him therefore both the Deities create  The Sov'raign Umpire in their grand Debate  And he declar'd for  Jove  When  Juno  fir'd  More than so trivial an Affair requir'd  Depriv'd him in her Fury of his Sight  And left him groping round in sudden Night  But  Jove  for so it is in Heav'n decree'd  That no one God repeal Another's Deed  Irradiates all his Soul with inward Light  And with the Prophet's Art relieves the want of Sight  The Transformation of ECHO  Fam'd far and near for knowing things to come  From him th' enquiring Nations sought their Doom  The fair  Liriope  his Answers try'd  And first th' unerring Prophet justify'd  This Nymph the God  Cephisus  had abus'd  With all his winding Waters circumfus'd  And on the  Nereid  got a lovely Boy  Whom the soft Maids ev'n then beheld with Joy  The tender Dame sollicitous to know  Whether her Child should reach old Age or no  Consults the Sage  Tiresias  who replies  " If e'er he knows himself he surely dies  Long liv'd the dubious Mother in Suspence  'Till Time unriddled all the Prophet's Sense  Narcissus  now his Sixteenth Year began  Just turn'd of Boy and on the Verge of Man  Many a Friend the blooming Youth caress'd  Many a Lovesick Maid her Flame confess'd  Such was his Pride in vain the Friend caress'd  The Lovesick Maid in vain her Flame confess'd  Once in the Woods as he pursu'd the Chace  The babbling  Echo  had descry'd his Face  She who in other's Words her Silence breaks  Nor speaks her self but when another speaks  Echo  was then a Maid of Speech bereft  Of wonted Speech for tho' her Voice was left  Juno  a Curse did on her Tongue impose  To sport with ev'ry Sentence in the Close  Full often when the Goddess might have caught  Jove  and her Rivals in the very Fault  This Nymph with subtle Stories would delay  Her Coming 'till the Lovers slipp'd away  The Goddess found out the Deceit in time  And then she cry'd " That Tongue for this thy Crime  " Which could so many subtle Tales produce  " Shall be hereafter but of little use  Hence 'tis she prattles in a fainter Tone  With mimick Sounds and Accents not her own  This Lovesick Virgin overjoy'd to find  The Boy alone still follow'd him behind  When glowing warmly at her near Approach  As Sulphur blazes at the Taper's Touch  She long'd her hidden Passion to reveal  And tell her Pains but had not Words to tell  She can't begin but waits for the Rebound  To catch his Voice and to return the Sound  The Nymph when nothing could  Narcissus  move  Still dash'd with Blushes for her slighted Love  Liv'd in the shady Covert of the Woods  In solitary Caves and dark Abodes  Where pining wander'd the rejected Fair  'Till harrass'd out and worn away with Care  The sounding Skeleton of Blood bereft  Besides her Bones and Voice had nothing left  Her Bones are petrify'd her Voice is found  In Vaults where still it Doubles ev'ry Sound  The Story of NARCISSUS  Thus did the Nymphs in vain caress the Boy  He still was Lovely but he still was Coy  When one fair Virgin of the slighted Train  Thus pray'd the Gods provok'd by his Disdain  " Oh may he love like me and love like me in vain  Rhamnusia  pity'd the neglected Fair  And with just Vengeance answer'd to her Pray'r  There stands a Fountain in a darksom Wood  Nor stain'd with falling Leaves nor rising Mud  Untroubled by the Breath of Winds it rests  Unsully'd by the Touch of Men or Beasts  High Bow'rs of shady Trees above it grow  And rising Grass and chearful Greens below  Pleas'd with the Form and Coolness of the Place  And overheated by the Morning Chace  Narcissus  on the grassie Verdure lyes  But whilst within the Chrystal Fount he tries  To quench his Heat he feels new Heats arise  For as his own bright Image he survey'd  He fell in Love with the fantastick Shade  And o'er the Fair Resemblance hung unmov'd  Nor knew fond Youth it was himself he lov'd  The wellturn'd Neck and Shoulders he descries  The spacious Forehead and the spark'ling Eyes  The Hands that  Bacchus  might not scorn to show  And Hair that round  Apollo  's Head might flow  With all the Purple Youthfulness of Face  That gently blushes in the wat'ry Glass  By his own Flames consum'd the Lover lyes  And gives himself the Wound by which he dies  To the cold Water oft he joins his Lips  Oft catching at the beauteous Shade he dips  His Arms as often from himself he slips  Nor knows he who it is his Arms pursue  With eager Clasps but loves he knows not who  What could fond Youth this helpless Passion move  What kindle in thee this unpity'd Love  Thy own warm Blush within the Water glows  With thee the colour'd Shadow comes and goes  Its empty Being on thy self relies  Step Thou aside and the frail Charmer dies  Still o'er the Fountain's watry Gleam he stood  Mindless of Sleep and negligent of Food  Still view'd his Face and languish'd as he view'd  At length he rais'd his Head and thus began  To vent his Griefs and tell the Woods his Pain  " You Trees says he and thou surrounding Grove  " Who oft have been the kindly Scenes of Love  " Tell me if e'er within your Shades did lye  " A Youth so tortur'd so perplex'd as I  " I who before me see the Charming  " Whilst there he stands and yet he    " In such a Maze of Love my    " And yet no Bulwark'd Town nor  Coast  " Preserves the beauteous Youth from being seen  " No Mountains rise nor Oceans flow between  " A shallow Water hinders my Embrace  " And yet the lovely Mimick wears a Face  " That kindly smiles and when I bend to join  " My Lips to his he fondly bends to mine  " Hear gentle Youth and  my Complaint  " Come from thy Well  Inhabitant  "My Charms an easy Conquest have obtain'd  " O'er other Hearts by Thee alone disdain'd  " But why should I despair I'm sure he burns  " With equal Flames and languishes by turns  " Whene'er I stoop he offers at a Kiss  " And when my Arms I stretch he stretches his  " His Eye with Pleasure on my Face he keeps  " He smiles my Smiles and when I weep he weeps  " Whene'er I speak his moving Lips appear  " To utter something which I cannot hear  " Ah wretched me I now begin too late  " To find out all the longperplex'd Deceit  " It is my self I love my self I see  " The gay Delusion is a Part of me  " I kindle up the Fires by which I burn  " And my own Beauties from the Well return  " Whom should I Court how utter my Complaint  " Enjoyment but produces my Restraint  " And too much Plenty makes me die for Want  " How gladly would I from my self remove  " And at a distance set the Thing I love  " My Breast is warm'd with such unusual Fire  " I wish him absent whom I most desire  " And now I faint with Grief my Fate draws nigh  " In all the Pride of blooming Youth I die  " Death will the Sorrows of my Heart relieve  " Oh might the Visionary Youth survive  " I should with Joy my latest Breath resign  " But oh I see his Fate involv'd in mine  This said the weeping Youth again return'd  To the clear Fountain where again he burn'd  His Tears defac'd the Surface of the Well  With Circle after Circle as they fell  And now the lovely Face but half appears  O'errun with Wrinkles and deform'd with Tears  " Ah whither cries  Narcissus  dost thou fly  " Let me still feed the Flame by which I die  " Let me still See tho' I'm no further blest  Then rends his Garment off and beats his Breast  His naked Bosom redden'd with the Blow  In such a Blush as purple Clusters show  E're yet the Sun's Autumnal Heats refine  Their sprightly Juice and mellow it to Wine  The glowing Beauties of his Breast he spies  And with a new redoubled Passion dies  As Wax dissolves as Ice begins to run  And trickle into Drops before the Sun  So melts the Youth and languishes away  His Beauty withers and his Limbs decay  And none of those attractive Charms remain  To which the slighted  Echo  su'd in vain  She saw him in his present Misery  Whom spight of all her Wrongs she griev'd to see  She answer'd sadly to the Lover's Moan  Sigh'd back his Sighs and groan'd to ev'ry Groan  " Ah Youth belov'd in vain  Narcissus  cries  " Ah Youth belov'd in vain the Nymph replies  " Farewel says he the parting Sound scarce fell  From his faint Lips but she reply'd " Farewel  Then on th' unwholsome Earth he gasping lyes  'Till Death shuts up those selfadmiring Eyes  To the cold Shades his flitting Ghost retires  And in the  Stygian  Waves it self admires  For him the  Naiads  and the  Dryads  mourn  Whom the sad  Echo  answers in her turn  And now the SisterNymphs prepare his Urn  When looking for his Corps they only found  A rising Stalk with yellow Blossoms crown'd  The Story of PENTHEUS  This sad Event gave blind  Tiresias  Fame  Through  Greece  establish'd in a Prophet's Name  Th' unhallow'd  Pentheus  only durst deride  The cheated People and their Eyeless Guide  To whom the Prophet in his Fury said  Shaking the hoary Honours of his Head  " 'Twere well presumptuous Man 'twere well for thee  " If thou wert Eyeless too and blind like me  " For the Time comes nay 'tis already here  " When the young God's Solemnities appear  " Which if thou dost not with just Rites adorn  " Thy impious Carcass into Pieces torn  " Shall strew the Woods and hang on ev'ry Thorn  " Then then remember what I now foretel  " And own the blind  Tiresias  saw too well  Still  Pentheus  scorns him and derides his Skill  But Time did all the Prophet's Threats fulfil  For now thro' prostrate  Greece  young  Bacchus  rode  Whilst howling Matrons celebrate the God  All Ranks and Sexes to his  Orgies  ran  To mingle in the Pomps and fill the Train  When  Pentheus  thus his wicked Rage express'd  " What Madness  Thebans  has your Souls possess'd  " Can hollow Timbrels can a drunken Shout  " And the lewd Clamours of a beastly Rout  " Thus quell your Courage Can the weak Alarm  " Of Womens Yells those stubborn Souls disarm  " Whom nor the Sword nor Trumpet e'er could fright  " Nor the loud Din and Horror of a Fight  "And you our Sires who left your old Abodes  " And fix'd in foreign Earth your Country Gods  " Will you without a Stroak your City yield  " And poorly quit an undisputed Field  " But you whose Youth and Vigour should inspire  " Heroick Warmth and kindle Martial Fire  " Whom burnish'd Arms and crested Helmets grace  " Not flow'ry Garlands and a painted Face  " Remember him to whom you stand ally'd  " The Serpent for his Well of Waters dy'd  " He fought the Strong do you his Courage show  " And gain a Conquest o'er a Feeble Foe  " If  Thebes  must fall oh might the Fates afford  " A nobler Doom from Famine Fire or Sword  " Then might the  Thebans  perish with Renown  " But now a beardless Victor sacks the Town  " Whom nor the prancing Steed nor pond'rous Shield  " Nor the hack'd Helmet nor the dusty Field  " But the soft Joys of Luxury and Ease  " The purple Vests and flow'ry Garlands please  " Stand then aside I'll make the Counterfeit  " Renounce his Godhead and confess the Cheat  "  Acrisius  from the  Grecian  Walls repell'd  " This boasted Pow'r why then should  Pentheus  yield  " Go quickly drag th' audacious Boy to Me  " I'll try the Force of his Divinity  Thus did th' audacious Wretch those Rites profane  His Friends dissuade th' audacious Wretch in vain  In vain his Grandsire urg'd him to give o'er  His impious Threats the Wretch but raves the more  So have I seen a River gently glide  In a smooth Course and inoffensive Tide  But if with Dams its Current we restrain  It bears down all and Foams along the Plain  But now his Servants came besmear'd with Blood  Sent by their haughty Prince to seize the God  The God they found not in the frantick Throng  But dragg'd a zealous Votary along  The Mariners transform'd to Dolphins  Him  Pentheus  view'd with Fury in his Look  And scarce withheld his Hands whilst thus he spoke  " Vile Slave whom speedy Vengeance shall pursue  " And terrify thy base seditious Crew  " Thy Country and thy Parentage reveal  " And why thou join'st in these mad  Orgies  tell  The Captive views him with undaunted Eyes  And arm'd with inward Innocence replies  " From high  Meonia  's rocky Shores I came  " Of poor Descent  Acoetes  is my Name  " My Sire was meanly born no Oxen plow'd  " His fruitful Fields nor in his Pastures low'd  " His whole Estate within the Waters lay  " With Lines and Hooks he caught the finny Prey  " His Art was all his Livelihood which he  " Thus with his dying Lips bequeath'd to me  " In Streams my Boy and Rivers take thy Chance  " There swims said he thy whole Inheritance  " Long did I live on this poor Legacy  " 'Till tir'd with Rocks and my old native Sky  " To Arts of Navigation I inclin'd  " Observ'd the Turns and Changes of the Wind  " Learn'd the fit Havens and began to note  " The stormy  Hyades  the rainy  Goat    " The bright  Taygete  and the shining  Bears    With all the Sailor's Catalogue of Stars  " Once as by chance for  Delos  I design'd  " My Vessel driv'n by a strong Gust of Wind  "Moor'd in a  Chian  Creek ashore I went  " And all the following Night in  Chios  spent  " When Morning rose I sent my Mates to bring  " Supplies of Water from a neighb'ring Spring  " Whilst I the Motion of the Winds explor'd  " Then summon'd in my Crew and went aboard  "  Opheltes  heard my Summons and with Joy  " Brought to the Shoar a soft and lovely Boy  " With more than Female Sweetness in his Look  " Whom straggling in the neighb'ring Fields he took  " With Fumes of Wine the little Captive glows  " And nods with Sleep and staggers as he goes  " I view'd him nicely and began to trace  " Each heav'nly Feature each immortal Grace  " And saw Divinity in all his Face  " I know not who said I this God should be  " But that he is a God I plainly see  " And Thou whoe'er thou art excuse the Force  " These Men have us'd and oh befriend our Course  " Pray not for us the nimble  Dictys  cry'd  "  Dictys  that could the MaintopMast bestride  " And down the Ropes with active Vigour slide  " To the same Purpose old  Epopeus  spoke  " Who overlook'd the Oars and tim'd the Stroke  " The same the Pilot and the same the rest  " Such impious Avarice their Souls possest  " Nay Heav'n forbid that I should bear away  " Within my Vessel so divine a Prey  " Said I and stood to hinder their Intent  " When  Lycabas  a Wretch for Murder sent  " From  Tuscany  to suffer Banishment  " With his clench'd Fist had struck me overboard  " Had not my Hands in falling grasp'd a Cord  "His base Confederates the Fact approve  " When  Bacchus  for 'twas he begun to move  " Wak'd by the Noise and Clamours which they rais'd  " And shook his drowsie Limbs and round him gaz'd  " What means this Noise he cries am I betray'd  " Ah whither whither must I be convey'd  " Fear not said  Proreus  Child but tell us where  " You wish to land and trust our friendly Care  " To  Naxos  then direct your Course said he  "  Naxos  a hospitable Port shall be  " To each of you a joyful Home to me  " By ev'ry God that rules the Sea or Sky  " The perjur'd Villains promise to comply  " And bid me hasten to unmoor the Ship  " With eager Joy I launch into the Deep  " And heedless of the Fraud for  Naxos  stand  " They whisper oft and beckon with the Hand  " And give me Signs all anxious for their Prey  " To tack about and fsteer another Way  " Then let some other to my Post succeed  " Said I I'm guiltless of so foul a Deed  " What says  Ethalion  must the Ship's whole Crew  " Follow your Humour and depend on you  " And strait himself he seated at the Prore  " And tack'd about and sought another Shore  " The beauteous Youth now found himself betray'd  " And from the Deck the rising Waves survey'd  " And seem'd to weep and as he wept he said  " And do you thus my easy Faith beguile  " Thus do you bear me to my native Isle  " Will such a Multitude of Men employ  " Their Strength against a weak defenceless Boy  "In vain did I the Godlike Youth deplore  " The more I begg'd they thwarted me the more  " And now by all the Gods in Heav'n that hear  " This solemn Oath by  Bacchus  self I swear  " The mighty Miracle that did ensue  " Although it seems beyond Belief is true  " The Vessel fix'd and rooted in the Flood  " Unmov'd by all the beating Billows stood  " In vain the Mariners would plow the Main  " With Sails unfurl'd and strike their Oars in vain  " Around their Oars a twining Ivy cleaves  " And climbs the Mast and hides the Cords in Leaves  " The Sails are cover'd with a chearful Green  " And Berries in the fruitful Canvase seen  " Amidst the Waves a sudden Forrest rears  " Its verdant Head and a new Spring appears  " The God we now behold with open'd Eyes  " A Herd of spotted Panthers round him lyes  " In glaring Forms the grapy Clusters spread  " On his fair Brows and dangle on his Head  " And whilst he frowns and brandishes his Spear  " My Mates surpriz'd with Madness or with Fear  " Leap'd overboard first perjur'd  Madon  found  " Rough Scales and Fins his stiff'ning Sides surround  " Ah what cries one has thus transform'd thy Look  " Strait his own Mouth grew wider as he spoke  " And now himself he views with like Surprize  " Still at his Oar th' industrious  Libys  plies  " But as he plies each busy Arm shrinks in  " And by degrees is fashion'd to a Fin  " Another as he catches at a Cord  " Misses his Arms and tumbling overboard  "With his broad Fins and forky Tail he laves  " The rising Surge and flounces in the Waves  " Thus all my Crew transform'd around the Ship  " Or dive below or on the Surface leap  " And spout the Waves and wanton in the Deep  " Full nineteen Sailors did the Ship convey  " A Shole of nineteen Dolphins round her play  " I only in my proper Shape appear  " Speechless with Wonder and half dead with Fear  " 'Till  Bacchus  kindly bid me fear no more  " With him I landed on the  Chian  Shore  " And him shall ever gratefully adore  " This forging Slave says  Pentheus  would prevail  " O'er our just Fury by a farfetch'd Tale  " Go let him feel the Whips the Swords the Fire  " And in the Tortures of the Rack expire  Th' officious Servants hurry him away  And the poor Captive in a Dungeon lay  But whilst the Whips and Tortures are prepar'd  The Gates fly open of themselves unbarr'd  At Liberty th' unfetter'd Captive stands  And flings the loosen'd Shackles from his Hands  The Death of PENTHEUS  But  Pentheus  grown more furious than before  Resolv'd to send his Messengers no more  But went himself to the distracted Throng  Where high  Cithaeron  echo'd with their Song  And as the fiery Warhorse paws the Ground  And snorts and trembles at the Trumpet's Sound  Transported thus he heard the frantick Rout  And rav'd and madden'd at the distant Shout  A spacious Circuit on the Hill there stood  Level and wide and skirted round with Wood  Here the rash  Pentheus  with unhallow'd Eyes  The howling Dames and mystick  Orgies  spies  His Mother sternly view'd him where he stood  And kindled into Madness as she view'd  Her leafy Jav'lin at her Son she cast  And cries " The Boar that lays our Country waste  " The Boar my Sisters Aim the fatal Dart  " And strike the brindled Monster to the Heart  Pentheus  astonish'd heard the dismal Sound  And sees the yelling Matrons gath'ring round  He sees and weeps at his approaching Fate  And begs for Mercy and repents too late  " Help help my Aunt  Autonöe  he cry'd  " Remember how your own  Actaeon  dy'd  Deaf to his Cries the frantick Matron crops  One stretch'dout Arm the other  Ino  lops  In vain does  Pentheus  to his Mother sue  And the raw bleeding Stumps presents to view  His Mother howl'd and heedless of his Pray'r  Her trembling Hand she twisted in his Hair  " And This she cry'd shall be  Agave  's Share  When from the Neck his struggling Head she tore  And in her Hands the ghastly Visage bore  With Pleasure all the hideous Trunk survey  Then pull'd and tore the mangled Limbs away  As starting in the Pangs of Death it lay  Soon as the Wood its leafy Honours casts  Blown off and scatter'd by autumnal Blasts  With such a sudden Death lay  Pentheus  slain  And in a thousand Pieces strow'd the Plain

Tasks they ply with various Art  And thro' the Loom the sliding Shuttle dart  Or at the Fire to comb the Wooll they stand  Or twirl the Spindle with a dext'rous Hand  Guilty themselves they force the Guiltless in  Their Maids who share the Labour share the Sin  At last one Sister cries who nimbly knew  To draw nice Threads and winde the finest Clue  While others idly rove and Gods revere  Their fancy'd Gods they know not who or where  Let us whom  Pallas  taught her better Arts  Still working cheer with mirthful Chat our Hearts  And to deceive the Time let me prevail  With each by turns to tell some antique Tale  She said her Sisters lik'd the Humour well  And smiling bad her the first Story tell  But she awhile profoundly seem'd to muse  Perplex'd amid Variety to chuse  And knew not whether she should first relate  The poor  Dircetis  and her wond'rous Fate  The  Palestines  believe it to a Man  And show the Lake in which her Scales began  Or if she rather should the Daughter sing  Who in the hoary Verge of Life took Wing  Who soar'd from Earth and dwelt in Tow'rs on high  And now a Dove she flits along the Sky  Or how lewd  Naïs  when her Lust was cloy'd  To Fishes turn'd the Youths she had enjoy'd  By pow'rful Verse and Herbs Effect most strange  At last the Changer shar'd herself the Change  Or how the Tree which once white Berries bore  Still crimson bears since stain'd with crimson Gore  The Tree was new she likes it and begins  To tell the Tale and as she tells she spins  The Story of PYRAMUS and THISBE  In  Babylon  where first her Queen for State  Rais'd Walls of Brick magnificently great  Liv'd  Pyramus  and  Thisbe  lovely Pair  He found no Eastern Youth his Equal there  And she beyond the fairest Nymph was fair  A closer Neighbourhood was never known  Tho' two the Houses yet the Roof was one  Acquaintance grew th' Acquaintance they improve  To Friendship Friendship ripen'd into Love  Love had been crown'd but impotently mad  What Parents could not hinder they forbad  For with fierce Flames young  Pyramus  still burn'd  And grateful  Thisbe  Flames as fierce return'd  Aloud in Words their Thoughts they dare not break  But silent stand and silent Looks can speak  The Fire of Love the more it is supprest  The more it glows and rages in the Breast  When the Divisionwall was built a Chink  Was left the Cement unobserv'd to shrink  So slight the Cranny that it still had been  For Centuries unclos'd because unseen  But oh what thing so small so secret lies  Which scapes if form'd for Love a Lover's Eyes  Ev'n in this narrow Chink they quickly found  A friendly Passage for a trackless Sound  Safely they told their Sorrows and their Joys  In whisper'd Murmurs and a dying Noise  By turns to catch each other's Breath they strove  And suck'd in all the balmy Breeze of Love  Oft as on diff'rent Sides they stood they cry'd  Malicious Wall thus Lovers to divide  Suppose thou should'st awhile to us give Place  To lock and fasten in a close Embrace  But if too much to grant so sweet a Bliss  Indulge at least the Pleasure of a Kiss  We scorn Ingratitude To thee we know  This safe Conveyance of our Minds we owe  Thus they their vain Petition did renew  Till Night and then they softly sigh'd Adieu  But first they strove to kiss and that was all  Their Kisses dy'd untasted on the Wall  Soon as the Morn had o'er the Stars prevail'd  And warn'd by  Phoebus  Flow'rs their Dews exhal'd  The Lovers to their wellknown Place return  Alike they suffer and alike they mourn  At last their Parents they resolve to cheat  If to deceive in Love be call'd Deceit  To steal by Night from home and thence unknown  To seek the Fields and quit th' unfaithful Town  But to prevent their wand'ring in the Dark  They both agree to fix upon a Mark  A Mark that could not their Designs expose  The Tomb of  Ninus  was the Mark they chose  There they might rest secure beneath the Shade  Which Boughs with snowy Fruit encumber'd made  A widespread Mulberry its Rise had took  Just on the Margin of a gurgling Brook  Impatient for the friendly Dusk they stay  And chide the Slowness of departing Day  In Western Seas down sunk at last the Light  From Western Seas uprose the Shades of Night  The loving  Thisbe  ev'n prevents the Hour  With cautious Silence she unlocks the Door  And veils her Face and marching thro' the Gloom  Swiftly arrives at th' AssignationTomb  For still the fearful Sex can fearless prove  Boldly they act if spirited by Love  When lo a Lioness rush'd o'er the Plain  Grimly besmear'd with Blood of Oxen slain  And what to the dire Sight new Horrors brought  To slake her Thirst the neighb'ring Spring she sought  Which by the Moon when trembling  Thisbe  spies  Wing'd with her Fear swift as the Wind she flies  And in a Cave recovers from her Fright  But drop'd her Veil confounded in her Flight  When sated with repeated Draughts again  The Queen of Beasts scour'd back along the Plain  She found the Veil and mouthing it all o'er  With bloody Jaws the lifeless Prey she tore  The Youth who could not cheat his Guards so soon  Late came and noted by the glimm'ring Moon  Some savage Feet new printed on the Ground  His Cheeks turn'd pale his Limbs no Vigour found  But when advancing on the Veil he spied  Distain'd with Blood and ghastly torn he cried  One Night shall Death to two young Lovers give  But she deserv'd unnumber'd Years to live  'Tis I am guilty I have thee betray'd  Who came not early as my charming Maid  Whatever slew thee I the Cause remain  I nam'd and fix'd the Place where thou wast slain  Ye Lions from your neighb'ring Dens repair  Pity the Wretch this impious Body tear  But Cowards thus for Death can idly crie  The Brave still have it in their Pow'r to die  Then to th'appointed Tree he hastes away  The Veil first gather'd tho' all rent it lay  The Veil all rent yet still itself endears  He kist and kissing wash'd it with his Tears  Tho' rich he cry'd with many a precious Stain  Still from my Blood a deeper Tincture gain  Then in his Breast his shining Sword he drown'd  And fell supine extended on the Ground  As out again the Blade he dying drew  Out spun the Blood and streaming upwards flew  So if a Conduitpipe e'er burst you saw  Swift spring the gushing Waters thro' the Flaw  Then spouting in a Bow they rise on high  And a new Fountain plays amid the Sky  The Berries stain'd with Blood began to show  A dark Complexion and forgot their Snow  While fatten'd with the flowing Gore the Root  Was doom'd for ever to a purple Fruit  Mean time poor  Thisbe  fear'd so long she stay'd  Her Lover might suspect a perjur'd Maid  Her Fright scarce o'er she strove the Youth to find  With ardent Eyes which spoke an ardent Mind  Already in his Arms she hears him sigh  At her Destruction which was once so nigh  The Tomb the Tree but not the Fruit she knew  The Fruit she doubted for its alter'd Hue  Still as she doubts her Eyes a Body found  Quiv'ring in Death and gasping on the Ground  She started back the Red her Cheeks forsook  And ev'ry Nerve with thrilling Horrors shook  So trembles the smooth Surface of the Seas  If brush'd o'er gently with a rising Breeze  But when her View her bleeding Love confest  She shriek'd she tore her Hair she beat her Breast  She rais'd the Body and embrac'd it round  And bath'd with Tears unfeign'd the gaping Wound  Then her warm Lips to the cold Face apply'd  And is it thus ah thus we meet she cry'd  My  Pyramus  whence sprung thy cruel Fate  My  Pyramus  ah speak e'er 'tis too late  I thy own  Thisbe  but one Word implore  One Word thy  Thisbe  never ask'd before  At  Thisbe  's Name awak'd he open'd wide  His dying Eyes with dying Eyes he try'd  On her to dwell but clos'd them slow and dy'd  The fatal Cause was now at last explor'd  Her Veil she knew and saw his sheathless Sword  From thy own Hand thy Ruin thou hast found  She said but Love first taught that Hand to wound  Ev'n I for thee as bold a Hand can show  And Love which shall as true direct the Blow  I will against the Woman's Weakness strive  And never thee lamented Youth survive  The World may say I caus'd alas thy Death  But saw thee breathless and resign'd my Breath  Fate tho' it conquers shall no Triumph gain  Fate that divides us still divides in vain  Now both our cruel Parents hear my Pray'r  My Pray'r to offer for us both I dare  Oh see our Ashes in one Urn confin'd  Whom Love at first and Fate at last has joyn'd  The Bliss you envy'd is not our Request  Lovers when dead may sure together rest  Thou Tree where now one lifeless Lump is laid  E'er long o'er two shalt cast a friendly Shade  Still let our Loves from thee be understood  Still witness in thy purple Fruit our Blood  She spoke and in her Bosom plung'd the Sword  All warm and reeking from it's slaughter'd Lord  The Pray'r which dying  Thisbe  had preferr'd  Both Gods and Parents with Compassion heard  The Whiteness of the Mulberry soon fled  And rip'ning sadden'd in a dusky Red  While both their Parents their lost Children mourn  And mix their Ashes in one golden Urn  Thus did the melancholy Tale conclude  And a short silent Interval ensu'd

so great a God  Confus'd she heard him his soft Passion tell  And on the Floor untwirl'd the Spindle fell  Still from the sweet Confusion some new Grace  Blush'd out by stealth and languish'd in her

list'ning Rocks her Moan  On the bare Earth she lies her Bosom bare  Loose her Attire dishevel'd is her Hair  Nine times the Morn unbarr'd the Gates of Light  As oft were spread th' alternate Shades of Night  So long no Sustenance the Mourner knew  Unless she drunk her Tears or suck'd the Dew  She turn'd about but rose not from the Ground  Turn'd to the Sun still as he roul'd his Round  On his bright Face hung her desiring Eyes  Till fix'd to Earth she strove in vain to rise  Her Looks their Paleness in a Flow'r retain'd  But here and there some purple Streaks they gain'd  Still the lov'd Object the fond Leafs pursue  Still move their Root the moving Sun to view  And in the  Heliotrope  the Nymph is true  The Sisters heard these Wonders with Surprise  But part receiv'd them as Romantick Lies  And pertly rally'd that they could not see  In Pow'rs Divine so vast an Energy  Part own'd true Gods such Miracles might do  But own'd not  Bacchus  one among the True  At last a common just Request they make  And beg  Alcithöe  her Turn to take  I will she said and please you if I can  Then shot her Shuttle swift and thus began  The Fate of  Daphnis  is a Fate too known  Whom an enamour'd Nymph transform'd to Stone  Because she fear'd another Nymph might see  The lovely Youth and love as much as she  So strange the Madness is of Jealousie  Nor shall I tell what Changes  Scython  made  And how he walk'd a Man or tripp'd a Maid  You too would peevish frown and Patience want  To hear how  Celmis  grew an Adamant  He once was dear to  Jove  and saw of old  Jove  when a Child but what he saw he told  Crocus  and  Smilax  may be turn'd to Flow'rs  And the  Curetes  spring from bounteous Show'rs  I pass a hundred Legends stale as these  And with sweet Novelty your Taste will please  The Story of SALMACIS and HERMAPHRODITUS  By Mr ADDISON  How  Salmacis  with weak enfeebling Streams  Softens the Body and unnerves the Limbs  And what the secret Cause shall here be shown  The Cause is secret but th' Effect is known  The  Naïds  nurst an Infant heretofore  That  Cytherea  once to  Hermes  bore  From both th' Illustrious Authors of his Race  The Child was nam'd nor was it hard to trace  Both the bright Parents thro' the Infant's Face  When fifteen Years in  Ida  's cool Retreat  The Boy had told he left his Native Seat  And sought fresh Fountains in a foreign Soil  The Pleasure lessen'd the attending Toil  With eager Steps the  Lycian  Fields he crost  And Fields that border on the  Lycian  Coast  A River here he view'd so lovely bright  It shew'd the Bottom in a fairer Light  Nor kept a Sand conceal'd from Human sight  The Stream produc'd nor slimy Ooze nor Weeds  Nor miry Rushes nor the spiky Reeds  But dealt enriching Moisture all around  The fruitful Banks with chearful Verdure crown'd  And kept the Spring Eternal on the Ground  A Nymph presides nor practis'd in the Chace  Nor skilful at the Bow nor at the Race  Of all the Blueey'd Daughters of the Main  The only Stranger to  Diana  's Train  Her Sisters often as 'tis said wou'd cry  " Fie  Salmacis  what always idle fie  " Or take thy Quiver or thy Arrows seize  " And mix the Toils of Hunting with thy Ease  Nor Quiver she nor Arrows e'er wou'd seize  Nor mix the Toils of Hunting with her Ease  But oft would bathe her in the Chrystal Tide  Oft with a Comb her dewy Locks divide  Now in the limpid Streams she views her Face  And drest her Image in the floating Glass  On Beds of Leaves she now repos'd her Limbs  Now gather'd Flow'rs that grew about her Stream  And then by chance was gathering as she stood  To view the Boy and long'd for what she view'd  Fain wou'd she meet the Youth with hasty Feet  She fain wou'd meet him but refus'd to meet  Before her Looks were set with nicest Care  And well deserv'd to be reputed Fair  " Bright Youth she cries whom all thy Features prove  " A God and if a God the God of Love  " But if a Mortal blest thy Nurse's Breast  " Blest are thy Parents and thy Sisters blest  " But oh how blest how more than blest thy Bride  " Ally'd in Bliss if any yet ally'd  " If so let mine the stoln Enjoyments be  " If not behold a willing Bride in me  The Boy knew nought of Love and toucht with Shame  He strove and blusht but still the Blush became  In rising Blushes still fresh Beauties rose  The sunny Side of Fruit such Blushes shows  And such the Moon when all her Silver White  Turns in Eclipses to a ruddy Light  The Nymph still begs if not a nobler Bliss  A cold Salute at least a Sister's Kiss  And now prepares to take the lovely Boy  Between her Arms He innocently coy  Replies " Or leave me to my self alone  " You rude uncivil Nymph or I'll be gone  " Fair Stranger then says she it shall be so  And for she fear'd his Threats she feign'd to go  But hid within a Covert's neighbouring Green  She kept him still in sight herself unseen  The Boy now fancies all the Danger o'er  And innocently sports about the Shore  Playsul and wanton to the Stream he trips  And dips his Foot and shivers as he dips  The Coolness pleas'd him and with eager haste  His airy Garments on the Banks he cast  His Godlike Features and his Heav'nly Hue  And all his Beauties were expos'd to View  His naked Limbs the Nymph with Rapture spies  While hotter Passions in her Bosom rise  Flush in her Cheeks and sparkle in her Eyes  She longs she burns to clasp him in her Arms  And looks and sighs and kindles at his Charms  Now all undrest upon the Banks he stood  And clapt his Sides and leapt into the Flood  His lovely Limbs the Silver Waves divide  His Limbs appear more lovely through the Tide  As Lilies shut within a Chrystal Case  Receive a glossy Lustre from the Glass  He's mine he's all my own the  Naïd  cries  And flings off all and after him she flies  And now she fastens on him as he swims  And holds him close and wraps about his Limbs  The more the Boy resisted and was coy  The more she clipt and kist the strugling Boy  So when the wrigling Snake is snacht on high  In  Eagle  's Claws and hisses in the Sky  Around the Foe his twirling Tail he flings  And twists her Legs and wriths about her Wings  The restless Boy still obstinately strove  To free himself and still refus'd her Love  Amidst his Limbs she kept her Limbs intwin'd  " And why coy Youth she cries why thus unkind  " Oh may the Gods thus keep us ever join'd  " Oh may we never never part again  So pray'd the Nymph nor did she pray in vain  For now she finds him as his Limbs she prest  Grow nearer still and nearer to her Breast  Till piercing each the other's Flesh they run  Together and incorporate in One  Last in one Face are both their Faces join'd  As when the Stock and grafted Twig combin'd  Shoot up the same and wear a common Rind  Both Bodies in a single Body mix  A single Body with a double Sex  The Boy thus lost in Woman now survey'd  The River's guilty Stream and thus he pray'd  He pray'd but wonder'd at his softer Tone  Surpriz'd to hear a Voice but half his own  You ParentGods whose Heav'nly Names I bear  Hear your  Hermaphrodite  and grant my Pray'r  Oh grant that whomsoe'er these Streams contain  If Man he enter'd he may rise again  Supple unsinew'd and but half a Man  The Heav'nly Parents answer'd from on high  Their twoshap'd Son the double Votary  Then gave a secret Virtue to the Flood  And ting'd it's Source to make his Wishes good  Continued by Mr EUSDEN  ALCITHÖE and her Sisters transform'd to Bats  But  Mineus  ' Daughters still their Tasks pursue  To Wickedness most obstinately true  At  Bacchus  still they laugh when all around  Unseen the Timbrels hoarse were heard to sound  Saffron and Myrrh their fragrant Odours shed  And now the present Deity they dread  Strange to relate Here Ivy first was seen  Along the Distaff crept the wond'rous Green  Then suddenspringing Vines began to bloom  And the soft Tendrils curl'd around the Loom  While purple Clusters dangling from on high  Ting'd the wrought Purple with a second Die  Now from the Skies was shot a doubtful Light  The Day declining to the Bounds of Night  The Fabrick's firm Foundations shake all o'er  False Tigers rage and figur'd Lions roar  Torches aloft seem blazing in the Air  And angry Flashes of red Light'nings glare  To dark Recesses the dire Sight to shun  Swift the pale Sisters in Confusion run  Their Arms were lost in Pinions as they fled  And subtle Films each slender Limb o'erspread  Their alter'd Forms their Senses soon reveal'd  Their Forms how alter'd Darkness still conceal'd  Close to the Roof each wond'ring upwards springs  Born on unknown transparent plumeless Wings  They strove for Words their little Bodies found  No Words but murmur'd in a fainting Sound  In Towns not Woods the sooty Batts delight  And never till the Dusk begin their Flight  Till  Vesper  rises with his Ev'ning Flame  From whom the  Romans  have deriv'd their Name  The Transformation of INO and MELICERTA to SeaGods  The Pow'r of  Bacchus  now o'er  Thebes  had flown  With awful Rev'rence soon the God they own  Proud  Ino  all around the Wonder tells  And on her NephewDeity still dwells  Of num'rous Sisters she alone yet knew  No Grief but Grief which she from Sisters drew  Imperial  Juno  saw her with Disdain  Vain in her Offspring in her Consort vain  Who rul'd the trembling  Thebans  with a Nod  But saw her vainest in her FosterGod  Could then she cry'd a BastardBoy have Pow'r  To make a Mother her own Son devour  Could he the  Tuscan  Crew to Fishes change  And now three Sisters damn to Forms so strange  Yet shall the Wife of  Jove  find no Relief  Shall she still unreveng'd disclose her Grief  Have I the mighty Freedom to complain  Is that my Pow'r is that to ease my Pain  A Foe has taught me Vengeance and who ought  To scorn that Vengeance which a Foe has taught  What sure Destruction frantick Rage can throw  The gaping Wounds of slaughter'd  Pentheus  show  Why should not  Ino  fir'd with Madness stray  Like her mad Sisters her own Kindred slay  Why she not follow where they lead the way  Down a steep yawning Cave where Yews display'd  In Arches meet and lend a baleful Shade  Thro' silent Labyrinths a Passage lies  To mournful Regions and infernal Skies  Here  Styx  exhales its noisome Clouds and here  The fun'ral Rites once paid all Souls appear  Stiff Cold and Horror with a ghastly Face  And staring Eyes infest the dreary Place  Ghosts newarriv'd and Strangers to these Plains  Know not the Palace where grim  Pluto  reigns  They journey doubtful nor the Road can tell  Which leads to the Metropolis of Hell  A thousand Avenues those Tow'rs command  A thousand Gates for ever open stand  As all the Rivers disembogu'd find Room  For all their Waters in old Ocean's Womb  So this vast City Worlds of Shades receives  And Space for Millions still of Worlds she leaves  The unbody'd Spectres freely rove and show  Whate'er they lov'd on Earth they love below  The Lawyers still or right or wrong support  The Courtiers smoothly glide to  Pluto  's Court  Still airy Heroes Thoughts of Glory fire  Still the dead Poet strings his deathless Lyre  And Lovers still with fancy'd Darts expire  The Queen of Heav'n to gratifie her Hate  And sooth immortal Wrath forgets her State  Down from the Realms of Day to Realms of Night  The Goddess swift precipitates her Flight  At Hell arriv'd the Noise Hell's Porter heard  Th' enormous Dog his triple Head uprear'd  Thrice from three grizly Throats he howl'd profound  Then suppliant couch'd and stretch'd along the Ground  The trembling Threshold which  Saturnia  prest  The Weight of such Divinity confest  Before a lofty adamantine Gate  Which clos'd a Tow'r of Brass the Furies sate  Mishapen Forms tremendous to the Sight  Th' implacable foul Daughters of the Night  A sounding Whip each bloody Sister shakes  Or from her Tresses combs the curling Snakes  But now great  Juno  's Majesty was known  Thro' the thick Gloom allheav'nly bright she shone  The hideous Monsters their Obedience show'd  And rising from their Seats submissive bow'd  This is the Place of Woe here groan the Dead  Huge  Tityus  o'er nine Acres here is spread  Fruitful for Pain th' immortal Liver bleeds  Still grows and still th' insatiate Vulture feeds  Poor  Tantalus  to taste the Water tries  But from his Lips the faithless Water flies  Then thinks the bending Tree he can command  The Tree starts backwards and eludes his Hand  The Labour too of  Sisyphus  is vain  Up the steep Mount he heaves the Stone with Pain  Down from the Summit rouls the Stone again  The  Belides  their leaky Vessels still  Are ever filling and yet never fill  Doom'd to this Punishment for Blood they shed  For Bridegrooms slaughter'd in the Bridal Bed  Stretch'd on the rouling Wheel  Ixion  lies  Himself he follows and himself he flies  Ixion  tortur'd  Juno  sternly cy'd  Then turn'd and toiling  Sisyphus  espy'd  And why she said so wretched is the Fate  Of him whose Brother proudly reigns in State  Yet still my Altars unador'd have been  By  Athamas  and his presumptuous Queen  What caus'd her Hate the Goddess thus confest  What caus'd her Journey now was more than guest  That Hate relentless its Revenge did want  And that Revenge the Furies soon could grant  They could the Glory of proud  Thebes  efface  And hide in Ruin the  Cadmëan  Race  For this she largely promises entreats  And to Entreaties adds Imperial Threats  Then fell  Tisiphonè  with Rage was stung  And from her Mouth th' untwisted Serpents flung  To gain this trifling Boon there is no need  She cry'd in formal Speeches to proceed  Whatever thou command'st to do is done  Believe it finish'd tho' not yet begun  But from these melancholy Seats repair  To happier Mansions and to purer Air  She spoke The Goddess darting upwards flies  And joyous reascends her native Skies  Nor enter'd there 'till 'round her  Iris  threw  Ambrosial Sweets and pour'd Celestial Dew  The faithful Fury guiltless of Delays  With cruel Haste the dire Command obeys  Girt in a bloody Gown a Torch she shakes  And 'round her Neck twines speckled Wreaths of Snakes  Fear and Dismay and agonizing Pain  With frantick Rage compleat her loveless Train  To  Thebes  her Flight she sped and Hell forsook  At her Approach the  Theban  Turrets shook  The Sun shrunk back thick Clouds the Day o'ercast  And springing Greens were wither'd as she past  Now dismal Yellings heard strange Spectres seen  Confound as much the Monarch as the Queen  In vain to quit the Palace they prepar'd  Tisiphonè  was there and kept the Ward  She wideextended her unfriendly Arms  And all the Fury lavish'd all her Harms  Part of her Tresses loudly hiss and part  Spread Poyson as their forky Tongues they dart  Then from her middle Locks two Snakes she drew  Whose Merit from superior Mischief grew  Th' envenom'd Ruin thrown with spiteful Care  Clung to the Bosoms of the hapless Pair  The hapless Pair soon with wild Thoughts were fir'd  And Madness by a thousand ways inspir'd  'Tis true th' unwounded Body still was sound  But 'twas the Soul which felt the deadly Wound  Nor did th' unsated Monster here give o'er  But dealt of Plagues a fresh unnumber'd Store  Each baneful Juice too well she understood  Foam churn'd by  Cerberus  and  Hydra  's Blood  Hot Hemlock and cold Aconite she chose  Delighted in Variety of Woes  Whatever can untune th' harmonious Soul  And its mild reas'ning Faculties controul  Give false Ideas raise Desires profane  And whirl in Eddies the tumultuous Brain  Mix'd with curs'd Art she direfully around  Thro' all their Nerves diffus'd the sad Compound  Then toss'd her Torch in Circles still the same  Improv'd their Rage and added Flame to Flame  The grinning Fury her own Conquest spy'd  And to her rueful Shades return'd with Pride  And threw th' exhausted useless Snakes aside  Now  Athamas  cries out his Reason fled  Here Fellowhunters let the Toils be spread  I saw a Lioness in quest of Food  With her two Young run roaring in this Wood  Again the fancy'd Savages were seen  As thro' his Palace still he chac'd his Queen  Then tore  Learchus  from her Breast The Child  Stretch'd little Arms and on its Father smil'd  A Father now no more who now begun  Around his Head to whirl his giddy Son  And quite insensible to Nature's Call  The helpless Infant slung against the Wall  The same mad Poyson in the Mother wrought  Young  Melicerta  in her Arms she caught  And with disorder'd Tresses howling flies  O  Bacchus    Evôe    Bacchus  loud she cries  The Name of  Bacchus Juno  laugh'd to hear  And said thy FosterGod has cost thee dear  A Rock there stood whose Side the beating Waves  Had long consum'd and hollow'd into Caves  The Head shot forwards in a bending Steep  And cast a dreadful Covert o'er the Deep  The wretched  Ino  on Destruction bent  Climb'd up the Cliff such Strength her Fury lent  Thence with her guiltless Boy who wept in vain  At one bold Spring she plung'd into the Main  Her Neice's Fate touch'd  Cytherëa  's Breast  And in soft Sounds she  Neptune  thus addrest  Great God of Waters whose extended Sway  Is next to his whom Heav'n and Earth obey  Let not the Suit of  Venus  thee displease  Pity the Floaters on th'  Ionian  Seas  Encrease thy SubjectGods nor yet disdain  To add my Kindred to that glorious Train  If from the Sea I may such Honours claim  If 'tis Desert that from the Sea I came  As  Greecian  Poets artfully have sung  And in the Name confest from whence I sprung  Pleas'd  Neptune  nodded his Ascent and free  Both soon became from frail Mortality  He gave them Form and Majesty Divine  And bad them glide along the foamy Brine  For  Melicerta  is  Palaemon  known  And  Ino  once  Leucothöe  is grown  The Transformation of the THEBAN Matrons  The  Theban  Matrons their lov'd Queen pursu'd  And tracing to the Rock her Footsteps view'd  Too certain of her Fate they rend the Skies  With piteous Shrieks and lamentable Cries  All beat their Breasts and  Juno  all upbraid  Who still remember'd a deluded Maid  Who still revengeful for one stol'n Embrace  Thus wreak'd her Hate on the  Cadmëan  Race  This  Juno  heard And shall such Elfs she cry'd  Dispute my Justice or my Pow'r deride  You too shall feel my Wrath not idly spent  A Goddess never for Insults was meant  She who lov'd most and who most lov'd had been  Said Not the Waves shall part me from my Queen  She strove to plunge into the roaring Flood  Fix'd to the Stone a Stone herself she stood  This on her Breast would fain her Blows repeat  Her stiffen'd Hands refus'd her Breast to beat  That stretch'd her Arms unto the Seas in vain  Her Arms she labour'd to unstretch again  To tear her comely Locks another try'd  Both comely Locks and Fingers petrify'd  Part thus but  Juno  with a softer Mind  Part doom'd to mix among the feather'd Kind  Transform'd the Name of  Theban  Birds they keep  And skim the Surface of that fatal Deep  CADMUS and his QUEEN transform'd to Serpents  Mean time the wretched  Cadmus  mourns nor knows  That they who mortal fell immortal rose  With a long Series of new Ills opprest  He droops and all the Man forsakes his Breast  Strange Prodigies confound his frighted Eyes  From the fair City which he rais'd he flies  As if Misfortune not pursu'd his Race  But only hung o'er that devoted Place  Resolv'd by Sea to seek some distant Land  At last he safely gain'd th'  Illyrian  Strand  Chearless himself his Consort still he chears  Hoary and loaden'd both with Woes and Years  Then to recount past Sorrows they begin  And trace them to the gloomy Origin  That Serpent sure was hallow'd  Cadmus  cry'd  Which once my Spear transfix'd with foolish Pride  When the big Teeth a Seed before unknown  By me along the wond'ring Glebe were sown  And sprouting Armies by themselves o'erthrown  If thence the Wrath of Heav'n on me is bent  May Heav'n conclude it with one sad Event  To an extended Serpent change the Man  And while he spoke the wish'dfor Change began  His Skin with Seagreen Spots was vary'd 'round▪  And on his Belly prone he prest the Ground  He glitter'd soon with many a golden Scale  And his shrunk Legs clos'd in a spiry Tail  Arms yet remain'd remaining Arms he spread  To his lov'd Wife and human Tears yet shed  Come my  Harmonia  come thy Face recline  Down to my Face still touch what still is mine  O let these Hands while Hands be gently prest  While yet the Serpent has not all possest  More he had spoke but strove to speak in vain  The forky Tongue refus'd to tell his Pain  And learn'd in Hissings only to complain  Then shriek'd  Harmonia  Stay my  Cadmus  stay  Glide not in such a monstrous Shape away  Destruction like impetuous Waves rouls on  Where are thy Feet thy Legs thy Shoulders gone  Chang'd is thy Visage chang'd is all thy Frame  Cadmus  is only  Cadmus  now in Name  Ye Gods my  Cadmus  to himself restore  Or me like him transform I ask no more  The HusbandSerpent show'd he still had Thought  With wonted Fondness an Embrace he sought  Play'd 'round her Neck in many a harmless Twist  And lick'd that Bosom which a Man he kist  The Lookers on for Lookers on there were  Shock'd at the Sight halfdy'd away with Fear  The Transformation was again renew'd  And like the Husband chang'd the Wife they view'd  Both Serpents now with Fold involv'd in Fold  To the next Covert amicably roul'd  There curl'd they lie or wave along the Green  Fearless see Men by Men are fearless seen  Still mild and conscious what they once have been  The Story of PERSEUS  Yet tho' this harsh inglorious Fate they found  Each in the deathless Grandson liv'd renown'd  Thro' conquer'd  India Bacchus  nobly rode  And  Greece  with Temples hail'd the conqu'ring God  In  Argos  only proud  Acrisius  reign'd  Who all the consecrated Rites profan'd  Audacious Wretch thus  Bacchus  to deny  And the great Thunderer's great Son defie  Nor him alone Thy Daughter vainly strove  Brave  Perseus  of Celestial Stem to prove  And herself pregnant by a golden  Jove  Yet this was true and Truth in time prevails  Acrisius  now his Unbelief bewails  His former Thought an impious Thought he found  And both the Heroe and the God were own'd  He saw already one in Heav'n was plac'd  And one with more than mortal Triumphs grac'd  The Victor  Perseus  with the  Gorgon  head  O'er  Libyan  Sands his airy Journey sped  The gory Drops distill'd as swift he flew  And from each Drop envenom'd Serpents grew  The Mischiefs brooded on the barren Plains  And still th' unhappy Fruitfulness remains  ATLAS transform'd to a Mountain  Thence  Perseus  like a Cloud by Storms was driv'n  Thro' all th' Expanse beneath the Cope of Heav'n  The jarring Winds unable to controul  He saw the Southern and the Northern Pole  And Eastward thrice and Westward thrice was whirl'd  And from the Skies survey'd the nether World  But when grey Ev'ning show'd the Verge of Night  He fear'd in Darkness to pursue his Flight  He pois'd his Pinions and forgot to soar  And sinking clos'd them on th'  Hesperian  Shore  Then beg'd to rest till  Lucifer  begun  To wake the Morn the Morn to wake the Sun  Here  Atlas  reign'd of more than human Size  And in his Kingdom the World's Limit lies  Here  Titan  bids his weary'd Coursers sleep  And cools the burning Axle in the Deep  The mighty Monarch uncontroul'd alone  His Sceptre sways no neighb'ring States are known  A thousand Flocks on shady Mountains fed  A thousand Herds o'er grassy Plains were spread  Here wond'rous Trees their shining Stores unfold  Their shining Stores too wond'rous to be told  Their Leafs their Branches and their Apples Gold  Then  Perseus  the gigantick Prince addrest  Humbly implor'd a hospitable Rest  If bold Exploits thy Admiration fire  He said I fancy mine thou wilt admire  Or if the Glory of a Race can move  Not mean my Glory for I spring from  Jove  At this Confession  Atlas  ghastly star'd  Mindful of what an Oracle declar'd  That the dark Womb of Time conceal'd a Day  Which should disclos'd the bloomy Gold betray  All should at once be ravish'd from his Eyes  And  Jove  's own Progeny enjoy the Prize  For this the Fruit he loftily immur'd  And a fierce Dragon the strait Pass secur'd  For this all Strangers he forbad to land  And drove them from th' inhospitable Strand  To  Perseus  then Fly quickly fly this Coast  Nor falsly dare thy Acts and Race to boast  In vain the Heroe for one Night entreats  Threat'ning he storms and next adds Force to Threats  By Strength not  Perseus  could himself defend  For who in Strength with  Atlas  could contend  But since short Rest to me thou wilt not give  A Gift of endless Rest from me receive  He said and backward turn'd no more conceal'd  The Present and  Medusa  's Head reveal'd  Soon the high  Atlas  a high Mountain stood  His Locks and Beard became a leafy Wood  His Hands and Shoulders into Ridges went  The Summithead still crown'd the steep Ascent  His Bones a solid rocky Hardness gain'd  He thus immensely grown as Fate ordain'd  The Stars the Heav'ns and all the Gods sustain'd  ANDROMEDA rescued from the SeaMonster  Now  Aeolus  had with strong Chains confin'd  And deep imprison'd ev'ry blust'ring Wind  The rising  Phospher  with a purple Light  Did sluggish Mortals to new Toils invite  His Feet again the valiant  Perseus  plumes  And his keen Sabre in his Hand resumes  Then nobly spurns the Ground and upwards springs  And cuts the liquid Air with sounding Wings  O'er various Seas and various Lands he past  Till  Aethiopia  's Shore appear'd at last  Andromeda  was there doom'd to attone  By her own Ruin Follies not her own  And if Injustice in a God can be  Such was the  Libyan  God's unjust Decree  Chain'd to a Rock she stood young  Perseus  stay'd  His rapid Flight to view the beauteous Maid  So sweet her Frame so exquisitely fine  She seem'd a Statue by a Hand Divine  Had not the Wind her waving Tresses show'd  And down her Cheeks the melting Sorrows flow'd  Her faultless Form the Heroe's Bosom fires  The more he looks the more he still admires  Th' Admirer almost had forgot to fly  And swift descended flutt'ring from on high  O Virgin worthy no such Chains to prove  But pleasing Chains in the soft Folds of Love  Thy Country and thy Name he said disclose  And give a true Rehearsal of thy Woes  A quick Reply her Bashfulness refus'd  To the free Converse of a Man unus'd  Her rising Blushes had Concealment found  From her spread Hands but that her Hands were bound  She acted to her full Extent of Pow'r  And bath'd her Face with a fresh silent Show'r  But by degrees in Innocence grown bold  Her Name her Country and her Birth she told  And how she suffer'd for her Mother's Pride  Who with the  Nercids  once in Beauty vy'd  Part yet untold the Seas began to roar  And mounting Billows tumbled to the Shore  Above the Waves a Monster rais'd his Head  His Body o'er the Deep was widely spread  Onward he flounc'd aloud the Virgin cries  Each Parent to her Shrieks in Shrieks replies  But she had deepest Cause to rend the Skies  Weeping to her they cling no Sign appears  Of Help they only lend their helpless Tears  Too long you vent your Sorrows  Perseus  said  Short is the Hour and swift the time of Aid  In me the Son of thund'ring  Jove  behold  Got in a kindly Show'r of fruitful Gold  Medusa  's Snaky Head is now my Prey  And thro' the Clouds I boldly wing my Way  If such Desert be worthy of Esteem  Add if your Daughter I from Death redeem  Shall she be mine Shall it not then be thought  A Bride so lovely was too cheaply bought  For her my Arms I willingly employ  If I may Beauties which I save enjoy  The Parents eagerly the Terms embrace  For who would slight such Terms in such a Case  Nor her alone they promise but beside  The Dowry of a Kingdom with the Bride  As wellrigg'd Gallies which Slaves sweating row  With their sharp Beaks the whiten'd Ocean plough  So when the Monster mov'd still at his Back  The furrow'd Waters left a foamy Track  Now to the Rock he was advanc'd so nigh  Whirl'd from a Sling a Stone the Space would fly  Then bounding upwards the brave  Perseus  sprung  And in mid Air on hov'ring Pinions hung  His Shadow quickly floated on the Main  The Monster could not his wild Rage restrain  But at the floating Shadow leap'd in vain  As when  Jove  's Bird a speckled Serpent spies  Which in the Shine of  Phoebus  basking lies  Unseen he souses down and bears away  Truss'd from behind the vainly hissing Prey  To writh his Neck the Labour nought avails  Too deep th' imperial Talons pierce his Scales  Thus the wing'd Heroe now descends now soars  And at his Pleasure the vast Monster gores  Full in his Back swiftstooping from above  The crooked Sabre to its Hilt he drove  The Monster rag'd impatient of the Pain  First bounded high and then sunk low again  Now like a savage Boar when chaf'd with Wounds  And bay'd with op'ning Mouths of hungry Hounds  He on the Foe turns with collected Might  Who still eludes him with an airy Flight  And wheeling round the scaly Armour tries  Of his thick Sides his thinner Tail now plies  Till from repeated Strokes outgush'd a Flood  And the Waves redden'd with the streaming Blood  At last the dropping Wings befoam'd all o'er  With flaggy Heaviness their Master bore  A Rock he spy'd whose humble Head was low  Bare at an Ebb but cover'd at a Flow  A ridgy Hold he thither flying gain'd  And with one Hand his bending Weight sustain'd  With th' other vig'rous Blows he dealt around  And the Homethrusts th' expiring Monster own'd  In deaf'ning Shouts the glad Applauses rise  And Peal on Peal runs ratling thro' the Skies  The SaviourYouth the Royal Pair confess  And with heav'd Hands their Daughter's Bridegroom bless  The beauteous Bride moves on now loos'd from Chains  The Cause and sweet Reward of all the Heroe's Pains  Mean time on Shore triumphant  Perseus  stood  And purg'd his Hands smear'd with the Monster's Blood  Then in the Windings of a sandy Bed  Compos'd  Medusa  's execrable Head  But to prevent the Roughness Leafs he threw  And young green Twigs which soft in Waters grew  There soft and full of Sap but here when lay'd  Touch'd by the Head that Softness soon decay'd  The wonted Flexibility quite gone  The tender Scyons harden'd into Stone  Fresh juicy Twigs surpris'd the  Nereids  brought  Fresh juicy Twigs the same Contagion caught  The Nymphs the petrifying Seeds still keep  And propagate the Wonder thro' the Deep  The pliant Sprays of Coral yet declare  Their stiff'ning Nature when expos'd to Air  Those Sprays which did like bending Osiers move  Snatch'd from their

assign  To  Pallas  The mid Honours  Jove  were thine  He hastes for  Pallas  a white Cow to cull  A Calf for  Hermes  but for  Jove  a Bull  Then seiz'd the Prize of his victorious Fight  Andromeda  and claim'd the Nuptial Rite  Andromeda  alone he greatly sought  The DowryKingdom was not worth his Thought  Pleas'd  Hymen  now his golden Torch displays  With rich Oblations fragrant Altars blaze  Sweet Wreaths of choicest Flow'rs are hung on high  And cloudless Pleasure smiles in ev'ry Eye  The melting Musick melting Thoughts inspires  And warbling Songsters aid the warbling Lyres  The Palace

Mov'd round and brighten'd and enlarg'd each Soul  Then  Perseus  ask'd what Customs there obtain'd  And by what Laws the People were restrain'd  Which told the Teller a like Freedom takes  And to the Warrior his Petition makes  To know what Arts had won  Medusa  's Snakes  The Story of MEDUSA's Head  The Heroe with his just Request complies  Shows how a Vale beneath cold  Atlas  lies  Where with

Sister Sight  He stretch'd his Hand and stole their mutual Light  And left both Eyeless both involv'd in Night  Thro' devious Wilds and trackless Woods he past  And at the  Gorgon  Seats arriv'd at last  But as he journey'd pensive he survey'd  What wasteful Havock dire  Medusa  made  Here stood still breathing Statues Men before  There rampant Lions seem'd in Stone to roar  Nor did he yet affrighted quit the Field  But in the Mirror of his polish'd Shield  Reflected saw  Medusa  Slumbers take  And not one Serpent by good chance awake  Then backward an unerring Blow he sped  And from

 E Kirkall  OVID's METAMORPHOSES BOOK V  Translated by ARTHUR MAYNWARING  Esq  The Story of PERSEUS continued  _WHILE  Perseus  entertain'd with this Report  His Father  Cepheus  and the list'ning Court  Within the Palace Walls was heard aloud  The roaring Noise of some unruly Crowd  Not like the Songs which chearful Friends prepare  For nuptial Days but Sounds that threaten'd War  And all the Pleasures of this happy Feast  To Tumult turn'd in wild Disorder ceas'd  So when the Sea is calm we often find  A Storm rais'd sudden by some furious Wind  Chief in the Riot  Phineus  first appear'd  The rash Ringleader of this boist'rous Herd  And brandishing his brazenpointed Lance  Behold he said an injur'd Man advance  Stung with Resentment for his ravish'd Wife  Nor shall thy Wings O  Perseus  save thy Life  Nor  Jove  himself tho' we've been often told  Who got thee in the Form of tempting Gold  His Lance was aim'd when  Cepheus  ran and said  Hold Brother hold what brutal Rage has made  Your frantick Mind so black a Crime conceive  Are these the Thanks that you to  Perseus  give  This the Reward that to his Worth you pay  Whose timely Valour sav'd  Andromeda  Nor was it he if you would reason right  That forc'd her from you but the jealous Spight  Of envious  Nereids  and  Jove  's high Decree  And that devouring Monster of the Sea  That ready with his Jaws widegaping stood  To eat my Child the fairest of my Blood  You lost her then when she seem'd past Relief  And wish'd perhaps her Death to ease your Grief  With my Afflictions Not content to view  Andromeda  in Chains unhelp'd by you  Her Spouse and Uncle will you grieve that he Expos'd his Life the dying Maid to free  And shall you claim his Merit Had you thought  Her Charms so great you shou'd have bravely sought  That Blessing on the Rocks where fix'd she lay  But now let  Perseus  bear his Prize away  By Service gain'd by promis'd Faith possess'd  To him I owe it that my Age is bless'd  Still with a Child Nor think that I prefer  Perseus  to thee but to the Loss of her  Phineus  on him and  Perseus  roul'd about  His Eyes in silent Rage and seem'd to doubt  Which to destroy till resolute at length  He threw his Spear with the redoubled Strength  His Fury gave him and at  Perseus  struck  But missing  Perseus  in his Seat it stuck  Who springing nimbly up return'd the Dart  And almost plung'd it in his Rival's Heart  But he for Safety to the Altar ran  Unfit Protection for so vile a Man  Yet was the Stroke not vain as  Rhaetus  found  Who in his Brow receiv'd a mortal Wound  Headlong he tumbled when his Skull was broke  From which his Friends the fatal Weapon took  While he lay trembling and his gushing Blood  In crimson Streams around the Table flow'd  But this provok'd th' unruly Rabble worse  They flung their Darts and some in loud Discourse  To Death young  Perseus  and the Monarch doom  But  Cepheus  left before the guilty Room  With Grief appealing to the Gods above  Who Laws of Hospitality approve  Who Faith protect and succour injur'd Right  That he was guiltless of this barb'rous Fight  Pallas  her Brother  Perseus  close attends  And with her ample Shield from Harm defends  Raising a sprightly Courage in his Heart  But  Indian Athis  took the weaker Part  Born in the chrystal Grottoes of the Sea  Limnatè  's Son a Fenny Nymph and she  Daughter of  Ganges  Graceful was his Mein  His Person lovely and his Age Sixteen  His Habit made his native Beauty more  A purple Mantle fring'd with Gold he wore  His Neck wellturn'd with golden Chains was grac'd  His Hair with Myrrh perfum'd was nicely dress'd  Tho' with just Aim he cou'd the Javelin throw  Yet with more Skill he drew the bending Bow  And now was drawing it with artful Hand  When  Perseus  snatching up a flaming Brand  Whirl'd sudden at his Face the burning Wood  Crush'd his Eyes in and quench'd the Fire with Blood  Thro' the soft Skin the splinter'd Bones appear  And spoil'd the Face that lately was so fair  When  Lycabas  his  Athis  thus beheld  How was his Heart with friendly Horror fill'd  A Youth so noble to his Soul so dear  To see his shapeless Look his dying Groans to hear  He snatch'd the Bow the Boy was us'd to bend  And cry'd With me false Traytor dare contend  Boast not a Conquest o'er a Child but try  Thy Strength with me who all thy Pow'rs defy  Nor think so mean an Act a Victory  While yet he spoke he flung the whizzing Dart  Which pierc'd the plaited Robe but miss'd his Heart  Perseus  defy'd upon him fiercely press'd  With Sword unsheath'd and plung'd it in his Breast  His Eyes o'erwhelm'd with Night he stumbling falls  And with his latest Breath on  Athis  calls  Pleas'd that so near the lovely Youth he lies  He sinks his Head upon his Friend and dies  Next eager  Phorbas  old  Methion  's Son  Came rushing forward with  Amphimedon    When the smooth Pavement slippery made with Gore  Trip'd up their Feet and flung 'em on the Floor  The Sword of  Perseus  who by chance was nigh  Prevents their Rise and where they fall they lye  Full in his Ribs  Amphimedon  he smote  And then stuck fiery  Phorbas  in the Throat  Eurythus  lifting up his Ax the Blow  Was thus prevented by his nimble Foe  A golden Cup he seizes high embost  And at his Head the massy Goblet tost  It hits and from his Forehead bruis'd rebounds  And Blood and Brains he vomits from his Wounds  With his slain Fellows on the Floor he lies  And Death for ever shuts his swimming Eyes  Then  Polydaemon  fell a Goddessborn  Phlegias  and  Elycen  with Locks unshorn  Next follow'd next the Stroke of Death he gave  To  Clytus    Abanis  and  Lycetus  brave  While o'er unnumber'd Heaps of ghastly Dead  The  Argive  Heroe's Feet triumphant tread  But  Phineus  stands aloof and dreads to feel  His Rival's Force and flies his pointed Steel  Yet threw a Dart from far by chance it lights  On  Idas  who for neither Party fights  But wounded sternly thus to  Phineus  said  Since of a Neuter thou a Foe hast made  This I return thee drawing from his Side  The Dart which as he strove to fling he dy'd  Odites  fell by  Clymenus  's Sword  The  Cephen  Court had not a greater Lord  Hypseus  his Blade does in  Protenor  sheath  But brave  Lyncides  soon reveng'd his Death  Here too was old  Emathion  one that fear'd  The Gods and in the Cause of Heav'n appear'd  Who only wishing the Success of Right  And by his Age exempted from the Fight  Both Sides alike condemns This impious War  Cease cease he cries these bloody Broils forbear  This scarce the Sage with high Concern had said  When  Chromis  at a Blow struck off his Head  Which dropping on the royal Altar roul'd  Still staring on the Crowd with Aspect bold  And still it seem'd their horrid Strife to blame  In Life and Death his pious Zeal the same  While clinging to the Horns the Trunk expires  The sever'd Head consumes amidst the Fires  Then  Phineus  who from far his Javelin threw  Broteas  and  Ammon  Twins and Brothers slew  For knotted Gauntlets matchless in the Field  But Gauntlets must to Swords and Javelins yield  Ampycus  next with hallow'd Fillets bound  As  Ceres  ' Priest and with a Mitre crown'd  His Spear transfix'd and struck him to the Ground  O  läpetides  with Pain I tell  How you sweet Lyrist in the Riot fell  What worse than brutal Rage his Breast could fill  Who did thy Blood O Bard Celestial spill  Kindly you press'd amid the Princely Throng  To crown the Feast and give the Nuptial Song  Discord abhorr'd the Musick of thy Lyre  Whose Notes did gentle Peace so well inspire  Thee when fierce  Pettalus  far off espy'd  Defenceless with thy Harp he scoffing cry'd  Go to the Ghosts thy soothing Lessons play  We loath thy Lyre and scorn thy peaceful Lay  And as again he fiercely bid him go  He pierc'd his Temples with a mortal Blow  His Harp he held tho' sinking on the Ground  Whose Strings in Death his trembling Fingers found  By chance and tun'd by chance a dying Sound  With Grief  Lycormas  saw him fall from far  And wresting from the Door a massy Bar  Full in his Poll lays on a Load of Knocks  Which stun him and he falls like a devoted Ox  Another Bar  Pelates  would have snatch'd  But  Corythus  his Motions slily watch'd  He darts his Weapon from a private Stand  And rivets to the Post his veiny Hand  When strait a missive Spear transfix'd his Side  By  Abas  thrown and as he hung he dy'd  Melaneus  on the Prince's Side was slain  And  Dorylas  who own'd a fertile Plain  Of  Nasamonia  's Fields the wealthy Lord  Whose crowded Barns could scarce contain their Hoard  A whizzing Spear obliquely gave a Blow  Stuck in his Groin and pierc'd the Nerves below  His Foe beheld his Eyes convulsive roul  His ebbing Veins and his departing Soul  Then taunting said Of all thy spacious Plains  This Spot thy only Property remains  He left him thus but had no sooner left  Than  Perseus  in revenge his Nostrils cleft  From his Friend's Breast the murd'ring Dart he drew  And the same Weapon at the Murd'rer threw  His Head in halves the darted Javelin cut  And on each Side the Brain came issuing out  Fortune his Friend his Deaths around he deals  And this his Lance and that his Faulchion feels  Now  Clytius  dies and by a different Wound  The Twin his Brother  Clanis  bites the Ground  In his rent Jaw the bearded Weapon sticks  And the steel'd Dart does  Clytius  ' Thigh transfix  With these  Mendesian Celadon  he slew  And  Astreus  next whose Mother was a Jew  His Sire uncertain Then by  Perseus  fell  Aethion  who cou'd things to come foretell  But now he knows not whence the Javelin flies  That wounds his Breast nor by whose Arm he dies  The Squire to  Phineus  next his Valour try'd  And fierce  Agyrtes  stain'd with Parricide  As these are slain fresh Numbers still appear  And wage with  Perseus  an unequal War  To rob him of his Right the Maid he won  By Honour Promise and Desert his own  With him the Father of the beauteous Bride  The Mother and the frighted Virgin side  With Shrieks and doleful Cries they rend the Air  Their Shrieks confounded with the Din of War  With clashing Arms and Groanings of the Slain  They grieve unpitied and unheard complain  The Floor with ruddy Streams  Bellona  stains  And  Phineus  a new War with double Rage maintains  Perseus  begirt from all around they pour  Their Lances on him a tempestuous Show'r  Aim'd all at him a Cloud of Darts and Spears  Or blind his Eyes or whistle round his Ears  Their Numbers to resist against the Wall  He guards his Back secure and dares them all  Here from the Left  Molpeus  renews the Fight  And bold  Ethemon  presses on the Right  As when a hungry Tiger near him hears  Two lowing Herds awhile he both forbears  Nor can his Hopes of This or That renounce  So strong he lusts to prey on both at once  Thus  Perseus  now with That or This is loath  To war distinct but fain wou'd fall on Both  And first  Chaonian Molpeus  felt his Blow  And fled and never after fac'd his Foe  Then fierce  Ethemon  as he turn'd his Back  Hurried with Fury aiming at his Neck  His brandish'd Sword against the Marble struck  With all his Might the brittle Weapon broke  And in his Throat the Point rebounding stuck  Too slight the Wound for Life to issue thence  And yet too great for Battle or Defence  His Arms extended in this piteous State  For Mercy he wou'd sue but sues too late  Perseus  has in his Bosom plung'd the Sword  And e're he speaks the Wound prevents the Word  The Crowds encreasing and his Friends distress'd  Himself by warring Multitudes oppress'd  Since thus unequally you fight 'tis time  He cry'd to punish your presumptuous Crime  Beware my Friends his Friends were soon prepar'd  Their Sight averting high the Head he rear'd  And  Gorgon  on his Foes severely star'd  Vain Shift says  Thescelus  with Aspect bold  Thee and thy Bugbear Monster I behold  With Scorn he lifts his Arm but e're he threw  The Dart the Heroe to a Statue grew  In the same Posture still the Marble stands  And holds the Warrior's Weapons in its Hands  Amphyx  whom yet this Wonder can't alarm  Heaves at  Lyncides  ' Breast his impious Arm  But while thus daringly he presses on  His Weapon and his Arm are turn'd to Stone  Next  Nileus  he who vainly said he ow'd  His Origin to  Nile  's prolifick Flood  Who on his Shield seven silver Rivers bore  His Birth to witness by the Arms he wore  Full of his sev'nfold Father thus express'd  His Boast to  Perseus  and his Pride confess'd  See whence we sprung Let this thy Comfort be  In thy sure Death that thou didst die by me  While yet he spoke the dying Accents hung  In Sounds imperfect on his Marble Tongue  Tho' chang'd to Stone his Lips he seem'd to stretch  And thro' th'insensate Rock wou'd force a Speech  This  Eryx  saw but seeing wou'd not own  The Mischief by your selves he cries is done  'Tis your cold Courage turns your Hearts to Stone  Come follow me fall on the stripling Boy  Kill him and you his magick Arms destroy  Then rushing on his Arm to strike he rear'd  And marbled o'er his varied Frame appear'd  These for affronting  Pallas  were chastis'd  And justly met the Death they had despis'd  But brave  Aconteus    Perseus  ' Friend by chance  Look'd back and met the  Gorgon  's fatal Glance  A Statue now become he ghastly stares  And still the Foe to mortal Combat dares  Astyages  the living Likeness knew  On the dead Stone with vengeful Fury flew  But impotent his Rage the jarring Blade  No Print upon the solid Marble made  Again as with redoubled Might he struck  Himself astonish'd in the Quarry stuck  The vulgar Deaths 'twere tedious to rehearse  And Fates below the Dignity of Verse  Their Safety in their Flight Two Hundred found  Two Hundred by  Medusa  's Head were ston'd  Fierce  Phineus  now repents the wrongful Fight  And views his varied Friends a dreadful Sight  He knows their Faces for their Help he sues  And thinks not hearing him that they refuse  By Name he begs their Succour one by one  Then doubts their Life and feels the friendly Stone  Struck with Remorse and conscious of his Pride  Convict of Sin he turn'd his Eyes aside  With suppliant Mein to  Perseus  thus he prays  Hence with the Head as far as Winds and Seas  Can bear thee Hence O quit the  Cephen  Shore  And never curse us with  Medusa  more  That horrid Head which stiffens into Stone  Those impious Men who daring Death look on  I warr'd not with thee out of Hate or Strife  My honest Cause was to defend my Wife  First pledg'd to me What Crime cou'd I suppose  To arm my Friends and vindicate my Spouse  But vain too late I soe was our Design  Mine was the Title but the Merit thine  Contending made me guilty I confess  But Penitence shou'd make that Guilt the less  'Twas thine to conquer by  Minerva  's Pow'r  Favour'd of Heav'n thy Mercy I implore  For Life I sue the rest to thee I yield  In Pity from my Sight remove the Shield  He suing said nor durst revert his Eyes  On the grim Head And  Perseus  thus replies  Coward what is in me to grant I will  Nor Blood unworthy of my Valour spill  Fear not to perish by my vengeful Sword  From that secure 'tis all the Fates afford  Where I now see thee thou shalt still be seen  A lasting Monument to please our Queen  There still shall thy Betroth'd behold her Spouse  And find his Image in her Father's House  This said where  Phineus  turn'd to shun the Shield  Full in his Face the staring Head he held  As here and there he strove to turn aside  The Wonder wrought the Man was petrify'd  All Marble was his Frame his humid Eyes  Drop'd Tears which hung upon the Stone like Ice  In suppliant Posture with uplifted Hands  And fearful Look the guilty Statue stands  Hence  Perseus  to his native City hies  Victorious and rewarded with his Prize  Conquest o'er  Praetus  the Usurper won  He reinstates his Grandsire in the Throne  Praetus  his Brother dispossess'd by Might  His Realm enjoy'd and still detain'd his Right  But  Perseus  pull'd the haughty Tyrant down  And to the rightful King restor'd the Throne  Weak was th' Usurper as his Cause was wrong  Where  Gorgon  's Head appears what Arms are strong  When  Perseus  to his Host the Monster held  They soon were Statues and their King expell'd  Thence to  Seriphus  with the Head he sails  Whose Prince his Story treats as idle Tales  Lord of a little Isle he scorns to seem  Too credulous but laughs at That and Him  Yet did he not so much suspect the Truth  As out of Pride or Envy hate the Youth  The  Argive  Prince at his Contempt enrag'd  To force his Faith by fatal Proof engag'd  Friends shut your Eyes he cries his Shield he takes  And to the King expos'd  Medusa  's Snakes  The Monarch felt the Pow'r he wou'd not own  And stood convict of Folly in the Stone  MINERVA's Interview with the MUSES  Thus far  Minerva  was content to rove  With  Perseus  Offspring of her Father  Jove    Now hid in Clouds  Seriphos  she forsook  And to the  Theban  Tow'rs her Journey took  Cythnos  and  Gyaros  lying to the Right  She pass'd unheeded in her eager Flight  And choosing first on  Helicon  to rest  The Virgin Muses in these Words address'd  Me the strange Tidings of a newfound Spring  Ye learned Sisters to this Mountain bring  If all be true that Fame's wide Rumours tell  'Twas  Pegasus  discover'd first your Well  Whose piercing Hoof gave the soft Earth a Blow  Which broke the Surface where these Waters flow  I saw that Horse by Miracle obtain  Life from the Blood of dire  Medusa  slain  And now this equal Prodigy to view  From distant Isles to fam'd  Boeotia  flew  The Muse  Urania  said Whatever Cause  So great a Goddess to this Mansion draws  Our Shades are happy with so bright a Guest  You Queen are welcome and we Muses blest  What Fame has publish'd of our Spring is true  Thanks for our Spring to  Pegasus  are due  Then with becoming Courtesy she led  The curious Stranger to their Fountain's Head  Who long survey'd with Wonder and Delight  Their sacred Water charming to the Sight  Their ancient Groves dark Grottos shady Bow'rs  And smiling Plains adorn'd with various Flow'rs  O happy Muses she with Rapture cry'd  Who safe from Cares on this fair Hill reside  Blest in your Seat and free your selves to please  With Joys of Study and with glorious Ease  The Fate of PYRENEUS  Then one replies O Goddess fit to guide  Our humble Works and in our Choir preside  Who sure wou'd wisely to these Fields repair  To taste our Pleasures and our Labours share  Were not your Virtue and superior Mind  To higher Arts and nobler Deeds inclin'd  Justly you praise our Works and pleasing Seat  Which all might envy in this soft Retreat  Were we secur'd from Dangers and from Harms  But Maids are frighten'd with the least Alarms  And none are safe in this licentious Time  Still fierce  Pyreneus  and his daring Crime  With lashing Horror strikes my feeble Sight  Nor is my Mind recover'd from the Fright  With  Thracian  Arms this bold Usurper gain'd  Daulis  and  Phocis  where he proudly reign'd  It happen'd once as thro' his Lands we went  For the bright Temple of  Parnassus  bent  He met us there and in his artful Mind  Hiding the faithless Action he design'd  Confer'd on us whom Oh too well he knew  All Honours that to Goddesses are due  Stop stop ye Muses 'tis your Friend who calls  The Tyrant said Behold the Rain that falls  On ev'ry Side and that illboding Sky  Whose lowring Face portends more Storms are nigh  Pray make my House your own and void of Fear  While this bad Weather lasts take Shelter here  Gods have made meaner Places their Resort  And for a Cottage left their shining Court  Oblig'd to stop by the united Force  Of pouring Rains and complaisant Discourse  His courteous Invitation we obey  And in his Hall resolve awhile to stay  Soon it clear'd up the Clouds began to fly  The driving North refin'd the show'ry Sky  Then to pursue our Journey we began  But the false Traitor to his Portal ran  Stopt our Escape the Door securely barr'd  And to our Honour Violence prepar'd  But we transform'd to Birds avoid his Snare  On Pinions rising in the yielding Air  But he by Lust and Indignation fir'd  Up to his highest Tow'r with Speed retir'd  And cries In vain you from my Arms withdrew  The Way you go your Lover will pursue  Then in a flying Posture wildly plac'd  And daring from that Height himself to cast  The Wretch fell headlong and the Ground bestrew'd  With broken Bones and Stains of guilty Blood  The Story of the PIERIDES  The Muse yet spoke when they began to hear  A Noise of Wings that flutter'd in the Air  And strait a Voice from some high spreading Bough  Seem'd to salute the Company below  The Goddess wonder'd and inquir'd from whence  That Tongue was heard that spoke so plainly Sense  It seem'd to her a human Voice to be  But prov'd a Bird's for in a shady Tree  Nine Magpies perch'd lament their alter'd State  And what they hear are skilful to repeat  The Sister to the wondring Goddess said  These foil'd by us by us were thus repaid  These did  Evippè  of  Paeonia  bring  With nine hard LabourPangs to  Pella  's King  The foolish Virgins of their Number proud  And puff'd with Praises of the senseless Crowd  Thro' all  Achaia  and th'  Aemonian  Plains  Defy'd us thus to match their artless Strains  No more ye  Thespian  Girls your Notes repeat  Nor with false Harmony the Vulgar cheat  In Voice or Skill if you with us will vye  As many we in Voice or Skill will try  Surrender you to us if we excel  Fam'd  Aganippè  and  Medusa  's Well  The Conquest yours your Prize from us shall be  Th'  Aemathian  Plains to snowy  Paeonè  The Nymphs our Judges To dispute the Field  We thought a Shame but greater Shame to yield  On Seats of living Stone the Sisters sit  And by the Rivers swear to judge aright  The Song of the PIERIDES  Then rises one of the presumptuous Throng  Steps rudely forth and first begins the Song  With vain Address describes the Giants Wars  And to the Gods their fabled Acts prefers  She sings from Earth's dark Womb how  Typhon  rose  And struck with mortal Fear his heav'nly Foes  How the Gods fled to  Egypt  's slimy Soil  And hid their Heads beneath the Banks of  Nile    How  Typhon  from the conquer'd Skies pursu'd  Their routed Godheads to the sev'nmouth'd Flood  Forc'd ev'ry God his Fury to escape  Some beastly Form to take or earthly Shape  Jove  so she sung was chang'd into a Ram  From whence the Horns of  Libyan Ammon  came  Bacchus  a Goat  Apollo  was a Crow  Phaebè  a Cat the Wife of  Jove  a Cow  Whose Hue was whiter than the falling Snow  Mercury  to a nasty  Ibis  turn'd  The Change obscene afraid of  Typhon  mourn'd  While  Venus  from a Fish Protection craves  And once more plunges in her native Waves  She sung and to her Harp her Voice apply'd  Then us again to match her they defy'd  But our poor Song perhaps for you to hear  Nor Leisure serves nor is it worth your Ear  That causeless Doubt remove O Muse rehearse  The Goddess cry'd your evergrateful Verse  Beneath a chequer'd Shade she takes her Seat  And bids the Sister her whole Song repeat  The Sister thus  Calliopè  we chose  For the Performance The sweet Virgin rose  With Ivy crown'd she tunes her golden Strings  And to her Harp this Composition sings  The Song of the MUSES  First  Ceres  taught the lab'ring Hind to plow  The pregnant Earth and quickning Seed to sow  She first for Man did wholesom Food provide  And with just Laws the wicked World supply'd  All Good from her deriv'd to her belong  The grateful Tributes of the Muse's Song  Her more than worthy of our Verse we deem  Oh were our Verse more worthy of the Theme  Jove  on the Giant fair  Trinacria  hurl'd  And with one Bolt reveng'd his starry World  Beneath her burning Hills  Typhaeus  lies  And strugling always strives in vain to rise  Down does  Pelorus  his right Hand suppress  Toward  Latium  on the left  Pachynè  weighs  His Legs are under  Lilybaecum  spread  And  Aetna  presses hard his horrid Head  On his broad Back he there extended lies  And vomits Clouds of Ashes to the Skies  Oft lab'ring with his Load at last he tires  And spews out in Revenge a Flood of Fires  Mountains he struggles to o'erwhelm and Towns  Earth's inmost Bowels quake and Nature groans  His Terrors reach the direful King of Hell  He fears his Throws will to the Day reveal  The Realms of Night and fright his trembling Ghosts  This to prevent he quits the  Stygian  Coasts  In his black Carr by sooty Horses drawn  Fair  Sicily  he seeks and dreads the Dawn  Around her Plains he casts his eager Eyes  And ev'ry Mountain to the Bottom tries  But when in all the careful Search he saw  No Cause of Fear no ill suspected Flaw  Secure from Harm and wandring on at Will  Venus  beheld him from her flow'ry Hill  When strait the Dame her little  Cupid  prest  With secret Rapture to her snowy Breast  And in these Words the flutt'ring Boy addrest  O thou my Arms my Glory and my Pow'r  My Son whom Men and deathless Gods adore  Bend thy sure Bow whose Arrows never miss'd  No longer let Hell's King thy Sway resist  Take him while stragling from his dark Abodes  He coasts the Kingdoms of superior Gods  If Sovereign  Jove  if Gods who rule the Waves  And  Neptune  who rules them have been thy Slaves  Shall Hell be free The Tyrant strike my Son  Enlarge thy Mother's Empire and thy own  Let not our Heav'n be made the Mock of Hell  But  Pluto  to confess thy Pow'r compel  Our Rule is slighted in our native Skies  See  Pallas  see  Diana  too defies  Thy Darts which  Ceres  ' Daughter wou'd despise  She too our Empire treats with awkward Scorn  Such Insolence no longer's to be born  Revenge our slighted Reign and with thy Dart  Transfix the Virgin's to the Uncle's Heart  She said and from his Quiver strait he drew  A Dart that surely wou'd the Business do  She guides his Hand she makes her Touch the Test  And of a thousand Arrows chose the best  No Feather better pois'd a sharper Head  None had and sooner none and surer sped  He bends his Bow he draws it to his Ear  Thro'  Pluto  's Heart it drives and fixes there  The Rape of PROSERPINE  Near  Enna  's Walls a spacious Lake is spread  Fam'd for the sweetlysinging Swans it bred  Pergusa  is its Name And never more  Were heard or sweeter on  Cayster  's Shore  Woods crown the Lake and  Phoebus  ne'er invades  The tufted Fences or offends the Shades  Fresh fragrant Breezes fan the verdant Bow'rs  And the moist Ground smiles with enamel'd Flow'rs  The chearful Birds their airy Carols sing  And the whole Year is one eternal Spring  Here while young  Proserpine  among the Maids  Diverts herself in these delicious Shades  While like a Child with busy Speed and Care  She gathers Lillies here and Vi'lets there  While first to fill her little Lap she strives  Hell's grizly Monarch at the Shade arrives  Sees her thus sporting on the flow'ry Green  And loves the blooming Maid as soon as seen  His urgent Flame impatient of Delay  Swift as his Thought he seiz'd the beauteous Prey  And bore her in his sooty Carr away  The frighted Goddess to her Mother cries  But all in vain for now far off she flies  Far she behind her leaves her Virgin Train  To them too cries and cries to them in vain  And while with Passion she repeats her Call  The Vi'lets from her Lap and Lillies fall  She misses 'em poor Heart and makes new Moan  Her Lillies ah are lost her Vi'lets gone  O'er Hills the Ravisher and Vallies speeds  By Name encouraging his foamy Steeds  He rattles o'er their Necks the rusty Reins  And ruffles with the Stroke their shaggy Manes  O'er Lakes he whirls his flying Wheels and comes  To the  Palici  breathing sulph'rous Fumes  And thence to where the  Bacchiads  of Renown  Between unequal Havens built their Town  Where  Arethusa  round th' imprison'd Sea  Extends her crooked Coast to  Cyanè    The Nymph who gave the neighb'ring Lake a Name  Of all  Sicilian  Nymphs the first in Fame  She from the Waves advanc'd her beauteous Head  The Goddess knew and thus to  Pluto  said  Farther thou shalt not with the Virgin run  Ceres  unwilling canst thou be her Son  The Maid shou'd be by sweet Perswasion won  Force suits not with the Softness of the Fair  For if great things with small I may compare  Me  Anapis  once lov'd a milder Course  He took and won me by his Words not Force  Then stretching out her Arms she stopt his Way  But he impatient of the shortest Stay  Throws to his dreadful Steeds the slacken'd Rein  And strikes his Iron Sceptre thro' the Main  The Depths profound thro' yielding Waves he cleaves  And to Hell's Center a free Passage leaves  Down sinks his Chariot and his Realms of Night  The God soon reaches with a rapid Flight  CYANE dissolves to a Fountain  But still does  Cyanè  the Rape bemoan  And with the Goddess' Wrongs laments her own  For the stoln Maid and for her injur'd Spring  Time to her Trouble no Relief can bring  In her sad Heart a heavy Load she bears  Till the dumb Sorrow turns her all to Tears  Her mingling Waters with that Fountain pass  Of which she late immortal Goddess was  Her varied Members to a Fluid melt  A pliant Softness in her Bones is felt  Her wavy Locks first drop away in Dew  And liquid next her slender Fingers grew  The Body's Change soon seizes its Extreme  Her Legs dissolve and Feet flow off in Stream  Her Arms her Back her Shoulders and her Side  Her swelling Breasts in little Currents glide  A Silver Liquor only now remains  Within the Channel of her purple Veins  Nothing to fill Love's Grasp her Husband chaste  Bathes in that Bosom he before embrac'd  A Boy transform'd to an Eft  Thus while thro' all the Earth and all the Main  Her Daughter mournful  Ceres  sought in vain  Aurora  when with dewy Looks she rose  Nor burnish'd  Vesper  found her in Repose  At  Aetna  's flaming Mouth two pitchy Pines  To light her in her Search at length she tines  Restless with these thro' frosty Night she goes  Nor fears the cutting Winds nor heeds the Snows  And when the MorningStar the Day renews  From East to West her absent Child pursues  Thirsty at last by long Fatigue she grows  But meets no Spring no Riv'let near her flows  Then looking round a lowly Cottage spies  Smoaking among the Trees and thither hies  The Goddess knocking at the little Door  'Twas open'd by a Woman old and poor  Who when she begg'd for Water gave her Ale  Brew'd long but well preserv'd from being stale  The Goddess drank a chuffy Lad was by  Who saw the Liquor with a grutching Eye  And grinning cries She's greedy more than dry  Ceres  offended at his foul Grimace  Flung what she had not drunk into his Face  The Sprinklings speckle where they hit the Skin  And a long Tail does from his Body spin  His Arms are turn'd to Legs and lest his Size  Shou'd make him mischievous and he might rise  Against Mankind diminutives his Frame  Less than a Lizzard but in Shape the same  Amaz'd the Dame the wondrous Sight beheld  And weeps and fain wou'd touch her quondam Child  Yet her Approach th' affrighted Vermin shuns  And fast into the greatest Crevice runs  A Name they gave him which the Spots exprest  That rose like  Stellio  Stars and varied all his Breast  What Lands what Seas the Goddess wander'd o'er  Were long to tell for there remain'd no more  Searching all round her fruitless Toil she mourns  And with Regret to  Sicily  returns  At length where  Cyanè  now flows she came  Who cou'd have told her were she still the same  As when she saw her Daughter sink to Hell  But what she knows she wants a Tongue to tell  Yet this plain Signal manifestly gave  The Virgin's Girdle floating on a Wave  As late she dropt it from her slender Waste  When with her Uncle thro' the Deep she past  Ceres  the Token by her Grief confest  And tore her golden Hair and beat her Breast  She knows not on what Land her Curse shou'd fall  But as ingrate alike upbraids 'em all  Unworthy of her Gifts  Trinacria  most  Where the last Steps she found of what she lost  The Plough for this the vengeful Goddess broke  And with one Death the Ox and Owner struck  In vain the fallow Fields the Peasant tills  The Seed corrupted e're 'tis sown she kills  The fruitful Soil that once such Harvests bore  Now mocks the Farmer's Care and teems no more  And the rich Grain which fills the furrow'd Glade  Rots in the Seed or shrivels in the Blade  Or too much Sun burns up or too much Rain  Drowns or black Blights destroy the blasted Plain  Or greedy Birds the newsown Seed devour  Or Darnel Thistles and a Crop impure  Of knotted Grass along the Acres stand  And spread their thriving Roots thro' all the Land  Then from the Waves soft  Arethusa  rears  Her Head and back she flings her dropping Hairs  O Mother of the Maid whom thou so far  Hast sought of whom thou canst no Tidings hear  O thou she cry'd who art to Life a Friend  Cease here thy Search and let thy Labour end  Thy faithful  Sicily  's a guiltless Clime  And shou'd not suffer for another's Crime  She neither knew nor cou'd prevent the Deed  Nor think that for my Country thus I plead  My Country's  Pisa  I'm an Alien here  Yet these Abodes to  Elis  I prefer  No Clime to me so sweet no Place so dear  These Springs I  Arethusa  now possess  And this my Seat O gracious Goddess bless  This Island why I love and why I crost  Such spacious Seas to reach  Ortygia  's Coast  To you I shall impart when void of Care  Your Heart's at Ease and you're more fit to hear  When on your Brow no pressing Sorrow sits  For gay Content alone such Tales admits  When thro' Earth's Caverns I awhile have roul'd  My Waves I rise and here again behold  The long lost Stars and as I late did glide  Near  Styx    Proserpina  there I espy'd  Fear still with Grief might in her Face be seen  She still her Rape laments yet made a Queen  Beneath those gloomy Shades her Sceptre sways  And ev'n th' infernal King her Will obeys  This heard the Goddess like a Statute stood  Stupid with Grief and in that musing Mood  Continu'd long new Cares awhile supprest  The reigning Pow'rs of her immortal Breast  At last to  Jove  her Daughter's Sire she flies  And with her Chariot cuts the chrystal Skies  She comes in Clouds and with dishevel'd Hair  Standing before his Throne prefers her Pray'r  King of the Gods defend my Blood and thine  And use it not the worse for being mine  If I no more am gracious in thy Sight  Be just O  Jove  and do thy Daughter right  In vain I sought her the wide World around  And when I most despair'd to find her found  But how can I the fatal Finding boast  By which I know she is for ever lost  Without her Father's Aid what other Pow'r  Can to my Arms the ravish'd Maid restore  Let him restore her I'll the Crime forgive  My Child tho' ravish'd I'd with Joy receive  Pity your Daughter with a Thief shou'd wed  Tho' mine you think deserves no better Bed  Jove  thus replies It equally belongs  To both to guard our common Pledge from Wrongs  But if to things we proper Names apply  This hardly can be call'd an Injury  The Theft is Love nor need we blush to own  The Thief if I can judge to be our Son  Had you of his Desert no other Proof  To be  Jove  's Brother is methinks enough  Nor was my Throne by Worth superior got  Heav'n fell to me as Hell to him by Lot  If you are still resolv'd her Loss to mourn  And nothing less will serve than her Return  Upon these Terms she may again be yours  Th'irrevocable Terms of Fate not ours  Of  Stygian  Food if she did never taste  Hell's Bounds may then and only then be past  The Transformation of ASCALAPHUS into an Owl  The Goddess now resolving to succeed  Down to the gloomy Shades descends with Speed  But adverse Fate had otherwise decreed  For long before her giddy thoughtless Child  Had broke her Fast and all her Projects spoil'd  As in the Garden's shady Walks she stray'd  A fair Pomegranate charm'd the simple Maid  Hung in her Way and tempting her to taste  She pluck'd the Fruit and took a short Repast  Seven times a Seed at once she eat the Food  The Fact  Ascalaphus  had only view'd  Whom  Acheron  begot in  Stygian  Shades  On  Orphnè  fam'd among  Avernal  Maids  He saw what past and by discov'ring all  Detain'd the ravish'd Nymph in cruel Thrall  But now a Queen she with Resentment heard  And chang'd the vile Informer to a Bird  In  Phlegeton  's black Stream her Hand she dips  Sprinkles his Head and wets his babbling Lips  Soon on his Face bedropt with Magick Dew  A Change appear'd and gawdy Feathers grew  A crooked Beak the Place of Nose supplies  Rounder his Head and larger are his Eyes  His Arms and Body waste but are supply'd  With yellow Pinions flagging on each Side  His Nails grow crooked and are turn'd to Claws  And lazily along his heavy Wings he draws  Illomen'd in his Form th' unlucky Fowl  Abhorr'd by Men and call'd a Scrieching Owl  The Daughters of ACHELOUS transform'd to SIRENS  Justly this Punishment was due to him  And less had been too little for his Crime  But O ye Nymphs that from the Flood descend  What Fault of yours the Gods cou'd so offend  With Wings and Claws your beauteous Forms to spoil  Yet save your maiden Face and winning Smile  Were you not with her in  Pergusa  's Bow'rs  When  Proserpine  went forth to gather Flow'rs  Since  Pluto  in his Carr the Goddess caught  Have you not for her in each Climate sought  And when on Land you long had search'd in vain  You wish'd for Wings to cross the pathless Main  That Earth and Sea might witness to your Care  The Gods were easy and return'd your Pray'r  With golden Wing o'er foamy Waves you fled  And to the Sun your plumy Glories spread  But lest the soft Enchantment of your Songs  And the sweet Musick of your flatt'ring Tongues  Shou'd quite be lost as courteous Fates ordain  Your Voice and Virgin Beauty still remain  Jove  some Amends for  Ceres  ' Loss to make  Yet willing  Pluto  shou'd the Joy partake  Gives 'em of  Proserpine  an equal Share  Who claim'd by both with both divides the Year  The Goddess now in either Empire sways  Six Moons in Hell and six with  Ceres  stays  Her peevish Temper's chang'd that sullen Mind  Which made ev'n Hell uneasy now is kind  Her Voice refines her Mein more sweet appears  Her Forehead free from Frowns her Eyes from Tears  As when with golden Light the conqu'ring Day  Thro' dusky Exhalations clears a Way  Ceres  her Daughter's Rape no longer mourn'd  But back to  Arethusa  's Spring return'd  And sitting on the Margin bid her tell  From whence she came and why a sacred Well  The Story of ARETHUSA  Still were the purling Waters and the Maid  From the smooth Surface rais'd her beauteous Head  Wipes off the Drops that from her Tresses ran  And thus to tell  Alpheus  ' Loves began  In  Elis  first I breath'd the living Air  The Chase was all my Pleasure all my Care  None lov'd like me the Forest to explore  To pitch the Toils and drive the bristled Boar  Of Fair tho' Masculine I had the Name  But gladly wou'd to that have quitted Claim  It less my Pride than Indignation rais'd  To hear the Beauty I neglected prais'd  Such Compliments I loath'd such Charms as these  I scorn'd and thought it Infamy to please  Once I remember in the Summer's Heat  Tir'd with the Chase I sought a cool Retreat  And walking on a silent Current found  Which gently glided o'er the grav'ly Ground  The chrystal Water was so smooth so clear  My Eye distinguish'd ev'ry Pebble there  So soft its Motion that I scarce perceiv'd  The running Stream or what I saw believ'd  The hoary Willow and the Poplar made  Along the shelving Bank a grateful Shade  In the cool Rivulet my Feet I dipt  Then waded to the Knee and then I stript  My Robe I careless on an Osier threw  That near the Place commodiously grew  Nor long upon the Border naked stood  But plung'd with Speed into the silver Flood  My Arms a thousand ways I mov'd and try'd  To quicken if I cou'd the lazy Tide  Where while I play'd my swimming Gambols o'er  I heard a murm'ring Voice and frighted sprung to Shore  Oh whither  Arethusa  dost thou fly  From the Brook's Bottom did  Alpheus  cry  Again I heard him in a hollow Tone  Oh whither  Arethusa  dost thou run  Naked I flew nor cou'd I stay to hide  My Limbs my Robe was on the other Side  Alpheus  follow'd fast th' inflaming Sight  Quicken'd his Speed and made his Labour light  He sees me ready for his eager Arms  And with a greedy Glance devours my Charms  As trembling Doves from pressing Danger fly  When the fierce Hawk comes sousing from the Sky  And as fierce Hawks the trembling Doves pursue  From him I fled and after me he flew  First by  Orchomenus  I took my Flight  And soon had  Psophis  and  Cyllene  in Sight  Behind me then high  Maenalus  I lost  And craggy  Erimanthus  scal'd with Frost  Elis  was next thus far the Ground I trod  With nimble Feet before the distanc'd God  But here I lagg'd unable to sustain  The Labour longer and my Flight maintain  While he more strong more patient of the Toil  And fir'd with Hopes of Beauty's speedy Spoil  Gain'd my lost Ground and by redoubled Pace  Now left between us but a narrow Space  Unweary'd I till now o'er Hills and Plains  O'er Rocks and Rivers ran and felt no Pains  The Sun behind me and the God I kept  But when I fastest shou'd have run I stept  Before my Feet his Shadow now appear'd  As what I saw or rather what I fear'd  Yet there I cou'd not be deceiv'd by Fear  Who felt his Breath pant on my braided Hair  And heard his sounding Tread and knew him to be near  Tir'd and despairing O Celestial Maid  I'm caught I cry'd without thy heav'nly Aid  Help me  Diana  help a Nymph forlorn  Devoted to the Woods who long has worn  Thy Livery and long thy Quiver born  The Goddess heard my pious Pray'r prevail'd  In muffling Clouds my Virgin Head was veil'd  The amorous God deluded of his Hopes  Searches the Gloom and thro' the Darkness gropes  Twice where  Diana  did her Servant hide  He came and twice O  Arethusa  cry'd  How shaken was my Soul how sunk my Heart  The Terror seiz'd on ev'ry trembling Part  Thus when the Wolf about the Mountain prowls  For Prey the Lambkin hears his horrid Howls  The tim'rous Hare the Pack approaching nigh  Thus hearkens to the Hounds and trembles at the Cry  Nor dares she stir for fear her scented Breath  Direct the Dogs and guide the threaten'd Death  Alpheus  in the Cloud no Traces found  To mark my Way yet stays to guard the Ground  The God so near a chilly Sweat possest  My fainting Limbs at ev'ry Pore exprest  My Strength distill'd in Drops my Hair in Dew  My Form was chang'd and all my Substance new  Each Motion was a Stream and my whole Frame  Turn'd to a Fount which still preserves my Name  Resolv'd I shou'd not his Embrace escape  Again the God resumes his fluid Shape  To mix his Streams with mine he fondly tries  But still  Diana  his Attempt denies  She cleaves the Ground thro' Caverns dark I run  A diff'rent Current while he keeps his own  To dear  Ortygia  she conducts my Way  And here I first review the welcome Day  Here  Arethusa  stopt then  Ceres  takes  Her golden Carr and yokes her fiery Snakes  With a just Rein along Midheaven she flies  O'er Earth and Seas and cuts the yielding Skies  She halts at  Athens  dropping like a Star  And to  Triptolemus  resigns her Carr  Parent of Seed she gave him fruitful Grain  And bad him teach to till and plough the Plain  The Seed to sow as well in fallow Fields  As where the Soil manur'd a richer Harvest yields  The Transformation of LYNCUS  The Youth o'er  Europe  and o'er  Asia  drives  Till at the Court of  Lyncus  he arrives  The Tyrant  Scythia  's barb'rous Empire sway'd  And when he saw  Triptolemus  he said  How cam'st thou Stranger to our Court and why  Thy Country and thy Name The Youth did thus reply  Triptolemus  my Name my Country's known  O'er all the World  Minerva  's fav'rite Town  Athens  the first of Cities in Renown  By Land I neither walk'd nor sail'd by Sea  But hither thro' the  Aether  made my Way  By me the Goddess who the Fields befriends  These Gifts the greatest of all Blessings sends  The Grain she gives if in your Soil you sow  Thence wholsom Food in golden Crops shall grow  Soon as the Secret to the King was known  He grudg'd the Glory of the Service done  And wickedly resolv'd to make it all his own  To hide his Purpose he invites his Guest  The Friend of  Ceres  to a royal Feast  And when sweet Sleep his heavy Eyes had seiz'd  The Tyrant with his Steel attempts his Breast  Him strait a Lynx's Shape the Goddess gives  And home the Youth her sacred Dragons drives  The PIERIDES transform'd to Magpies  The chosen Muse here ends her sacred Lays  The Nymphs unanimous decree the Bays  And give the  Heliconian  Goddesses the Praise  Then far from vain that we shou'd thus prevail  But much provok'd to hear the Vanquish'd rail  Calliopè  resumes Too long we've born  Your daring Taunts and your affronting Scorn  Your Challenge justly merited a Curse  And this unmanner'd Railing makes it worse  Since you refuse us calmly to enjoy  Our Patience next our Passions we'll employ  The Dictates of a Mind enrag'd pursue  And what our just Resentment bids us do  The Railers laugh our Threats and Wrath despise  And clap their Hands and make a scolding Noise  But in the Fact they're seiz'd beneath their Nails  Feathers they feel and on their Faces Scales  Their horny Beaks at once each other scare  Their Arms are plum'd and on their Backs they bear  Py'd Wings and flutter in the fleeting Air  Chatt'ring the Scandal of the Woods they fly  And there continue still their clam'rous Cry  The same their Eloquence as Maids or Birds  Now only Noise and nothing then but Words  The End of the Fifth Book  To Her Highness the Princess Anne Eldest Daughter of Their Royal Highnesses y  e  Prince Princess of Wales  OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK VI  Translated by Mr CROXALL  The Transformation of ARACHNE into a Spider  _PAllas  attending to the Muse's Song  Approv'd the just Resentment of their Wrong  And thus reflects While tamely I commend  Those who their injur'd Deities defend  My own Divinity affronted stands  And calls aloud for Justice at my Hands  Then takes the Hint asham'd to lag behind  And on  Arachnè  bends her vengeful Mind  One at the Loom so excellently skill'd  That to the Goddess she refus'd to yield  Low was her Birth and small her native Town  She from her Art alone obtain'd Renown  Idmon  her Father made it his Employ  To give the spungy Fleece a purple Dye  Of vulgar Strain her Mother lately dead  With her own Rank had been content to wed  Yet she their Daughter tho' her Time was spent  In a small Hamlet and of mean Descent  Thro' the great Towns of  Lydia  gain'd a Name  And fill'd the neighb'ring Countries with her Fame  Oft to admire the Niceness of her Skill  The  Nymphs  would quit their Fountain Shade or Hill  Thither from green  Tymolus  they repair  And leave the Vineyards their peculiar Care  Thither from fam'd  Pactolus  ' golden Stream  Drawn by her Art the curious  Naiads  came  Nor would the Work when finish'd please so much  As while she wrought to view each graceful Touch  Whether the shapeless Wooll in Balls she wound  Or with quick Motion turn'd the Spindle round  Or with her Pencil drew the neat Design  Pallas  her Mistress shone in ev'ry Line  This the proud Maid with scornful Air denies  And ev'n the Goddess at her Work defies  Disowns her heav'nly Mistress ev'ry Hour  Nor asks her Aid nor deprecates her Pow'r  Let us she cries but to a Tryal come  And if she conquers let her fix my Doom  The Goddess then a Beldame's Form put on  With silver Hairs her hoary Temples shone  Prop'd by a Staff she hobbles in her Walk  And tott'ring thus begins her old Wive's Talk  Young Maid attend nor stubbornly despise  The Admonitions of the Old and Wise  For Age tho' scorn'd a ripe Experience bears  That golden Fruit unknown to blooming Years  Still may remotest Fame your Labours crown  And Mortals your superior Genius own  But to the Goddess yield and humbly meek  A Pardon for your bold Presumption seek  The Goddess will forgive At this the Maid  With Passion fir'd her gliding Shuttle stay'd  And darting Vengeance with an angry Look  To  Pallas  in Disguise thus fiercely spoke  Thou doating Thing whose idle babling Tongue  But too well shews the Plague of living long  Hence and reprove with this your sage Advice  Your giddy Daughter or your awkward Neice  Know I despise your Counsel and am still  A Woman ever wedded to my Will  And if your skillful Goddess better knows  Let her accept the Tryal I propose  She does impatient  Pallas  strait replies  And cloath'd with heavenly Light sprung from her odd Disguise  The  Nymphs  and Virgins of the Plain adore  The awful Goddess and confess her Pow'r  The Maid alone stood unappall'd yet show'd  A transient Blush that for a Moment glow'd  Then disappear'd as purple Streaks adorn  The opening Beauties of the rosy Morn  Till  Phoebus  rising prevalently bright  Allays the Tincture with his Silver Light  Yet she persists and obstinately great  In hopes of Conquest hurries on her Fate  The Goddess now the Challenge waves no more  Nor kindly good advises as before  Strait to their Posts appointed both repair  And fix their threaded Looms with equal Care  Around the solid Beam the Web is ty'd  While hollow Canes the parting Warp divide  Thro' which with nimble Flight the Shuttles play  And for the Woof prepare a ready Way  The Woof and Warp unite press'd by the toothy Slay  Thus both their Mantles button'd to their Breast  Their skilful Fingers ply with willing haste  And work with Pleasure while they chear the Eye  With glowing Purple of the  Tyrian  Dye  Or justly intermixing Shades with Light  Their Colourings insensibly unite  As when a Show'r transpierc'd with Sunny Rays  It's mighty Arch along the Heav'n displays  From whence a thousand diff'rent Colours rise  Whose fine Transition cheats the clearest Eyes  So like the intermingled Shading seems  And only differs in the last Extreams  Then Threads of Gold both artfully dispose  And as each Part in just Proportion rose  Some antique Fable in their Work disclose  Pallas  in Figures wrought the heav'nly Pow'rs  And  Mars  's Hill among th'  Athenian  Tow'rs  On lofty Thrones twice six Celestials sate  Jove  in the Midst and held their warm Debate  The Subject weighty and wellknown to Fame  From whom the City should receive its Name  Each God by proper Features was exprest  Jove  with majestick Mein excell'd the rest  His threefork'd Mace the dewy SeaGod shook  And looking sternly smote the ragged Rock  When from the Stone leapt forth a spritely Steed  And  Neptune  claims the City for the Deed  Herself she blazons with a glitt'ring Spear  And crested Helm that veil'd her braided Hair  With Shield and scaly Breastplate Implements of War  Struck with her pointed Launce the teeming Earth  Seem'd to produce a new surprizing Birth  When from the Glebe the Pledge of Conquest sprung  A Tree palegreen with fairest Olives hung  And then to let her giddy Rival learn  What just Rewards such Boldness was to earn  Four Tryals at each Corner had their Part  Design'd in Miniature and touch'd with Art  Haemus  in one and  Rhodopè  of  Thrace    Transform'd to Mountains fill'd the foremost Place  Who claim'd the Titles of the Gods above  And vainly us'd the Epithets of  Jove  Another shew'd where the  Pigmaean  Dame  Profaning  Juno  's venerable Name  Turn'd to an airy Crane descends from far  And with her  Pigmy  Subjects wages War  In a third Part the Rage of Heaven's great Queen  Display'd on proud  Antigonè  was seen  Who with presumptuous Boldness dar'd to vye  For Beauty with the Empress of the Sky  Ah what avails her ancient Princely Race  Her Sire a King and  Troy  her native Place  Now to a noisy Stork transform'd she flies  And with her whiten'd Pinions cleaves the Skies  And in the last remaining Part was drawn  Poor  Cinyras  that seem'd to weep in Stone  Clasping the Temple Steps he sadly mourn'd  His lovely Daughters now to Marble turn'd  With her own Tree the finish'd Piece is crown'd  And Wreaths of peaceful Olive all the Work surround  Arachnè  drew the fam'd Intreagues of  Jove    Chang'd to a Bull to gratify his Love  How thro' the briny Tide all foaming Hoar  Lovely  Europa  on his Back he bore  The Sea seem'd waving and the trembling Maid  Shrunk up her tender Feet as if afraid  And looking back on the forsaken Strand  To her Companions wafts her distant Hand  Next she design'd  Asteria  's fabled Rape  When  Jove  assum'd a soaring Eagle's Shape  And shew'd how  Leda  lay supinely press'd  Whilst the soft snowy Swan sate hov'ring o'er her Breast  How in a Satyr's Form the God beguil'd  When fair  Antiopè  with Twins he fill'd  Then like  Amphitryon  but a real  Jove    In fair  Alcmena  's Arms he cool'd his Love  In fluid Gold to  Danaè  's Heart he came  Aegina  felt him in a lambent Flame  He took  Mnemosynè  in Shepherd's Make  And for  Dëois  was a speckled Snake  She made thee  Neptune  like a wanton Steer  Pacing the Meads for Love of  Arnè  dear  Next like a Stream thy burning Flame to slake  And like a Ram for fair  Bisaltis  ' sake  Then  Ceres  in a Steed your Vigour try'd  Nor cou'd the Mare the yellow Goddess hide  Next to a Fowl transform'd you won by Force  The Snakehair'd Mother of the winged Horse  And in a Dolphin's fishy Form subdu'd  Melantho  sweet beneath the oozy Flood  All these the Maid with lively Features drew  And open'd proper Landskips to the View  There  Phoebus  roving like a Country Swain  Attunes his jolly Pipe along the Plain  For lovely  Isse  's sake in Shepherd's Weeds  O'er Pastures green his bleating Flock he feeds  There  Bacchus  imag'd like the clust'ring Grape  Melting bedrops  Erigonè  's fair Lap  And there old  Saturn  stung with youthful Heat  Form'd like a Stallion rushes to the Feat  Fresh Flow'rs which Twists of Ivy intertwine  Mingling a running Foliage close the neat Design  This the bright Goddess passionately mov'd  With Envy saw yet inwardly approv'd  The Scene of heav'nly Guilt with haste she tore  Nor longer the Affront with Patience bore  A boxen Shuttle in her Hand she took  And more than once  Arachnè  's Forehead struck  Th' unhappy Maid impatient of the Wrong  Down from a Beam her injur'd Person hung  When  Pallas  pitying her wretched State  At once prevented and pronounc'd her Fate  Live but depend vile Wretch the Goddess cry'd  Doom'd in Suspence for ever to be ty'd  That all your Race to utmost Date of Time  May feel the Vengeance and detest the Crime  Then going off she sprinkled her with Juice  Which Leaves of baleful Aconite produce  Touch'd with the pois'nous Drug her flowing Hair  Fell to the Ground and left her Temples bare  Her usual Features vanish'd from their Place  Her Body lessen'd all but most her Face  Her slender Fingers hanging on each Side  With many Joynts the use of Legs supply'd  A Spider's Bag the rest from which she gives  A Thread and still by constant Weaving lives  The Story of NIOBE  Swift thro' the  Phrygian  Towns the Rumour flies  And the strange News each female Tongue employs  Niobè  who before she married knew  The famous Nymph now found the Story true  Yet unreclaim'd by poor  Arachnè  's Fate  Vainly above the Gods assum'd a State  Her Husband's Fame their Family's Descent  Their Pow'r and rich Dominion's wide Extent  Might well have justify'd a decent Pride  But not on these alone the Dame rely'd  Her lovely Progeny that far excell'd  The Mother's Heart with vain Ambition swell'd  The happiest Mother not unjustly styl'd  Had no conceited Thoughts her tow'ring Fancy fill'd  For once a Prophetess with Zeal inspir'd  Their slow Neglect to warm Devotion fir'd  Thro' ev'ry Street of  Thebes  who ran possess'd  And thus in Accents wild her Charge express'd  Haste haste ye  Theban  Matrons and adore  With hallow'd Rites  Latona  's mighty Pow'r  And to the heav'nly Twins that from her spring  With Laurel crown'd your smoaking Incense bring  Strait the great Summons ev'ry Dame obey'd  And due Submission to the Goddess paid  Graceful with Laurel Chaplets dress'd they came  And offer'd Incense in the sacred Flame  Mean while surrounded with a courtly Guard  The royal  Niobè  in State appear'd  Attir'd in Robes embroider'd o'er with Gold  And mad with Rage yet lovely to behold  Her comely Tresses trembling as she stood  Down her fine Neck with easy Motion flow'd  Then darting round a proud disdainful Look  In haughty Tone her hasty Passion broke  And thus began What Madness this to court  A Goddess founded meerly on Report  Dare ye a poor pretended Pow'r invoke  While yet no Altars to my Godhead smoke  Mine whose immediate Lineage stands confess'd  From  Tantalus  the only mortal Guest  That e'er the Gods admitted to their Feast  A Sister of the  Pleiads  gave me Birth  And  Atlas  mightiest Mountain upon Earth  Who bears the Globe of all the Stars above  My Grandsire was and  Atlas  sprung from  Jove  The  Theban  Towns my Majesty adore  And neighb'ring  Phrygia  trembles at my Pow'r  Rais'd by my Husband's Lute with Turrets crown'd  Our lofty City stands secur'd around  Within my Court wheree'er I turn my Eyes  Unbounded Treasures to my Prospect rise  With these my Face I modestly may name  As not unworthy of so high a Claim  Seven are my Daughters of a Form Divine  With seven fair Sons an indefective Line  Go Fools consider this and ask the Cause  From which my Pride its strong Presumption draws  Consider this and then prefer to me  Caeus  the  Titan  's vagrant Progeny  To whom in Travel the whole spacious Earth  No Room afforded for her spurious Birth  Not the least Part in Earth in Heaven or Seas  Would grant your outlaw'd Goddess any Ease  Till pitying her's from his own wandring Case  Delos  the floating Island gave a Place  There she a Mother was of two at most  Only the seventh Part of what I boast  My Joys all are beyond Suspicion fix'd  With no Pollutions of Misfortune mix d  Safe on the  Basis  of my Pow'r I stand  Above the Reach of  Fortune  's fickle Hand  Lessen she may my inexhausted Store  And much destroy yet still must leave me more  Suppose it possible that some may dye  Of this my num'rous lovely Progeny  Still with  Latona  I might safely vye  Who by her scanty Breed scarce fit to name  But just escapes the childless Woman's Shame  Go then with Speed your laurel'd heads uncrown  And leave the silly Farce you have begun  The tim'rous Throng their sacred Rites forbore  And from their Heads the verdant Laurel tore  Their haughty Queen they with Regret obey'd  And still in gentle Murmurs softly pray'd  High on the Top of  Cynthus  ' shady Mount  With Grief the Goddess saw the base Affront  And the Abuse revolving in her Breast  The Mother her Twinoffspring thus addrest  Lo I my Children who with Comfort knew  Your Godlike Birth and thence my Glory drew  And thence have claim'd Precedency of Place  From all but  Juno  of the heav'nly Race  Must now despair and languish in Disgrace  My Godhead question'd and all Rites Divine  Unless you succour banish'd from my Shrine  Nay more the Imp of  Tantalus  has flung  Reflections with her vile paternal Tongue  Has dar'd prefer her mortal Breed to mine  And call'd me childless which just Fate may she repine  When to urge more the Goddess was prepar'd  Phoebus  in haste replies Too much we've heard  And ev'ry Moment's lost while Vengeance is defer'd  Diana  spoke the same Then both enshroud  Their heav'nly Bodies in a sable Cloud  And to the  Theban  Tow'rs descending light  Thro' the soft yielding Air direct their Flight  Without the Wall there lies a champian Ground  With even Surface far extending round  Beaten and level'd while it daily feels  The trampling Horse and Chariot's grinding Wheels  Part of proud  Niobè  's young rival Breed  Practising there to ride the manag'd Steed  Their Bridles boss'd with Gold were mounted high  On stately Furniture of  Tyrian  Dye  Of these  Ismenos  who by Birth had been  The first fair Issue of the fruitful Queen  Just as he drew the Rein to guide his Horse  Around the Compass of the circling Course  Sigh'd deeply and the Pangs of Smart express'd  While the Shaft stuck engor'd within his Breast  And the Reins dropping from his dying Hand  He sunk quite down and tumbled on the Sand  Sipylus  next the rattling Quiver heard  And with full Speed for his Escape prepar'd  As when the Pilot from the black'ning Skies  A gath'ring Storm of wintry Rain descries  His Sails unfurl'd and crowded all with Wind  He strives to leave the threat'ning Cloud behind  So fled the Youth but an unerring Dart  O'ertook him quick discharg'd and sped with Art  Fix'd in his Neck behind it trembling stood  And at his Throat display'd the Point besmear'd with Blood  Prone as his Posture was he tumbled o'er  And bath'd his Courser's Mane with steaming Gore  Next at young  Phaedimus  they took their Aim  And  Tantalus  who bore his Grandsire's Name  These when their other Exercise was done  To try the Wrestler's oily Sport begun  And straining ev'ry Nerve their Skill express'd  In closest Grapple joyning Breast to Breast  When from the bending Bow an Arrow sent  Joyn'd as they were thro' both their Bodies went  Both groan'd and writhing both their Limbs with Pain  They fell together bleeding on the Plain  Then both their languid Eyeballs faintly roul  And thus together breath away their Soul  With Grief  Alphenor  saw their doleful Plight  And smote his Breast and sicken'd at the Sight  Then to their Succour ran with eager haste  And fondly griev'd their stiff'ning Limbs embrac'd  But in the Action falls A thrilling Dart  By  Phoebus  guided pierc'd him to the Heart  This as they drew it forth his Midriff tore  It's barbed Point the fleshy Fragments bore  And let the Soul gush out in Streams of purple Gore  But  Damasiethon  by a double Wound  Beardless and young lay gasping on the Ground  Fix'd in his sinewy Ham the steely Point  Stuck thro' his Knee and pierc'd the nervous Joint  And as he stoop'd to tug the painful Dart  Another struck him in a vital Part  Shot thro' his Wezon by the Wing it hung  The Lifeblood forc'd it out and darting upward sprung  Ilioneus  the last with Terror stands  Lifting in Pray'r his unavailing Hands  And ignorant from whom his Griefs arise  Spare me O all ye heav'nly Pow'rs he cries  Phoebus  was touch'd too late the sounding Bow  Had sent the Shaft and struck the fatal Blow  Which yet but gently gor'd his tender Side  So by a slight and easy Wound he dy'd  Swift to the Mother's Ears the Rumour came  And doleful Sighs the heavy News proclaim  With Anger and Surprize inflam'd by turns  In furious Rage her haughty Stomach burns  First she disputes th' Effects of heav'nly Pow'r  Then at their daring Boldness wonders more  For poor  Amphion  with sore Grief distrest  Hoping to sooth his Cares by endless Rest  Had sheath'd a Dagger in his wretched Breast  And she who toss'd her high disdainful Head  When thro' the Streets in solemn Pomp she led  The Throng that from  Latona  's Altar fled  Assuming State beyond the proudest Queen  Was now the miserablest Object seen  Prostrate among the claycold Dead she fell  And kiss'd an undistinguish'd last Farewel  Then her pale Arms advancing to the Skies  Cruel  Latona  triumph now she cries  My grieving Soul in bitter Anguish drench  And with my Woes your thirsty Passion quench  Feast your black Malice at a Price thus dear  While the sore Pangs of sev'n such Deaths I bear  Triumph too cruel Rival and display  Your conqu'ring Standard for you've won the Day  Yet I'll excel for yet tho' sev'n are slain  Superior still in Number I remain  Scarce had she spoke the Bowstring's twanging Sound  Was heard and dealt fresh Terrors all around  Which all but  Niobè  alone confound  Stunn'd and obdurate by her Load of Grief  Insensible she sits nor hopes Relief  Before the fun'ral Biers all weeping sad  Her Daughters stood in Vests of Sable clad  When one surpriz'd and stung with sudden Smart  In vain attempts to draw the sticking Dart  But to grim Death her blooming Youth resigns  And o'er her Brother's Corpse her dying Head reclines  This to asswage her Mother's Anguish tries  And silenc'd in the pious Action dies  Shot by a secret Arrow wing'd with Death  Her fault'ring Lips but only gasp'd for Breath  One on her dying Sister breathes her last  Vainly in Flight another's Hopes are plac'd  This hiding from her Fate a Shelter seeks  That trembling stands and fills the Air with Shrieks  And all in vain for now all six had found  Their Way to Death each by a diff'rent Wound  The last with eager Care the Mother veil'd  Behind her spreading Mantle close conceal'd  And with her Body guarded as a Shield  Only for this this youngest I implore  Grant me this one Request I ask no more  O grant me this she passionately cries  But while she speaks the destin'd Virgin dies  The Transformation of NIOBE  Widow'd and Childless lamentable State  A doleful Sight among the Dead she sate  Harden'd with Woes a Statue of Despair  To ev'ry Breath of Wind unmov'd her Hair  Her Cheek still red'ning but its Colour dead  Faded her Eyes and set within her Head  No more her pliant Tongue its Motion keeps  But stands congeal'd within her frozen Lips  Stagnate and dull within her purple Veins  Its Current stop'd the lifeless Blood remains  Her Feet their usual Offices refuse  Her Arms and Neck their graceful Gestures lose  Action and Life from ev'ry Part are gone  And ev'n her Entrails turn to solid Stone  Yet still she weeps and whirl'd by stormy Winds  Born thro' the Air her native Country finds  There fix'd she stands upon a bleaky Hill  There yet her marble Cheeks eternal Tears distil  The Peasants of LYCIA transform'd to Frogs  Then all reclaim'd by this Example show'd  A due Regard for each peculiar God  Both Men and Women their Devoirs express'd  And great  Latona  's awful Pow'r confess'd  Then tracing Instances of older Time  To suit the Nature of the present Crime  Thus one begins his TaleWhere  Lycia  yields  A golden Harvest from its fertile Fields  Some churlish Peasants in the Days of Yore  Provok'd the Goddess to exert her Pow'r  The thing indeed the Meanness of the Place  Has made obscure surprizing as it was  But I my self once happen'd to behold  This famous Lake of which the Story's told  My Father then worn out by Length of Days  Nor able to sustain the tedious Ways  Me with a Guide had sent the Plains to roam  And drive his wellfed stragling Heifers home  Here as we saunter'd thro' the verdant Meads  We spy'd a Lake o'ergrown with trembling Reeds  Whose wavy Tops an op'ning Scene disclose  From which an antique smoaky Altar rose  I as my superstitious Guide had done  Stop'd short and bless'd my self and then went on  Yet I enquir'd to whom the Altar stood  Faunus  the  Naiads  or some native God  No Silvan Deity my Friend replies  Enshrin'd within this hallow'd Altar lies  For this O Youth to that fam'd Goddess stands  Whom at th' imperial  Juno  's rough Commands  Of ev'ry Quarter of the Earth bereav'd  Delos  the floating Isle at length receiv'd  Who there in spite of Enemies brought forth  Beneath an Olive's Shade her great Twinbirth  Hence too she fled the furious Stepdame's Pow'r  And in her Arms a double Godhead bore  And now the Borders of fair  Lycia  gain'd  Just when the Summer Solstice parch'd the Land  With Thirst the Goddess languishing no more  Her empty'd Breast would yield its milky Store  When from below the smiling Valley show'd  A silver Lake that in its Bottom flow'd  A sort of Clowns were reaping near the Bank  The bending Osier and the Bullrush dank  The Cresse and Waterlilly fragrant Weed  Whose juicy Stalk the liquid Fountains feed  The Goddess came and kneeling on the Brink  Stoop'd at the fresh Repast prepar'd to drink  Then thus being hinder'd by the Rabble Race  In Accents mild expostulates the Case  Water I only ask and sure 'tis hard  From  Nature  's common Rights to be debar'd  This as the genial Sun and vital Air  Should flow alike to ev'ry Creature's Share  Yet still I ask and as a Favour crave  That which a publick Bounty Nature gave  Nor do I seek my weary Limbs to drench  Only with one cool Draught my Thirst I'd quench  Now from my Throat the usual Moisture dries  And ev'n my Voice in broken Accents dies  One Draught as dear as Life I should esteem  And Water now I thirst would Nectar seem  Oh let my little Babes your Pity move  And melt your Hearts to charitable Love  They as by chance they did extend to you  Their little Hands and my Request pursue  Whom would these soft Perswasions not subdue  Tho' the most rustick and unmanner'd Crew  Yet they the Goddess's Request refuse  And with rude Words reproachfully abuse  Nay more with spiteful Feet the Villains trod  O'er the soft Bottom of the marshy Flood  And blacken'd all the Lake with Clouds of rising Mud  Her Thirst by Indignation was suppress'd  Bent on Revenge the Goddess stood confess'd  Her suppliant Hands uplifting to the Skies  For a Redress to Heav'n she now applies  And May you live she passionately cry'd  Doom'd in that Pool for ever to abide  The Goddess has her Wish for now they chuse  To plunge and dive among the watry Ooze  Sometimes they shew their Head above the Brim  And on the glassy Surface spread to swim  Often upon the Bank their Station take  Then spring and leap into the cooly Lake  Still void of Shame they lead a clam'rous Life  And croaking still scold on in endless Strife  Compell'd to live beneath the liquid Stream  Where still they quarrel and attempt to skream  Now from their bloated Throat their Voice puts on  Imperfect Murmurs in a hoarser Tone  Their noisy Jaws with Bawling now grown wide  An ugly Sight extend on either Side  Their motly Back streak'd with a List of Green  Joyn'd to their Head without a Neck is seen  And with a Belly broad and white they look  Meer Frogs and still frequent the muddy Brook  The Fate of MARSYAS  Scarce had the Man this famous Story told  Of Vengeance on the  Lycians  shown of old  When strait Another pictures to their View  The  Satyr  's Fate whom angry  Phoebus  slew  Who rais'd with high Conceit and puff'd with Pride  At his own Pipe the skilful God defy'd  Why do you tear me from my self he cries  Ah cruel must my Skin be made the Prize  This for a silly Pipe he roaring said  Mean while the Skin from off his Limbs was flay'd  All bare and raw one large continu'd Wound  With Streams of Blood his Body bath'd the Ground  The blueish Veins their trembling Pulse disclos'd  The stringy Nerves lay naked and expos'd  His Guts appear'd distinctly each express'd  With ev'ry shining Fibre of his Breast  The  Fauns  and  Silvans  with the  Nymphs  that rove  Among the  Satyrs  in the shady Grove  Olympus  known of old and ev'ry Swain  That fed or Flock or Herd upon the Plain  Bewail'd the Loss and with their Tears that flow'd  A kindly Moisture on the Earth bestow'd  That soon conjoyn'd and in a Body rang'd  Sprung from the Ground to limpid Water chang'd  Which down thro'  Phrygia  's Rocks a mighty Stream  Comes tumbling to the Sea and  Marsya  is its Name  The Story of PELOPS  From these Relations strait the People turn  To present Truths and lost  Amphion  mourn  The Mother most was blam'd yet some relate  That  Pelops  pity'd and bewail'd her Fate  And stript his Cloaths and laid his Shoulder bare  And made the Iv'ry Miracle appear  This Shoulder from the first was form'd of Flesh  As lively as the other and as fresh  But when the Youth was by his Father slain  The Gods restor'd his mangled Limbs again  Only that Place which joins the Neck and Arm  The rest untouch'd was found to suffer Harm  The Loss of which an Iv'ry Piece sustain'd  And thus the Youth his Limbs and Life regain'd  The Story of TEREUS PROCNE and PHILOMELA  To  Thebes  the neighb'ring Princes all repair  And with Condolance the Misfortune share  Each bord'ring State in solemn Form address'd  And each betimes a friendly Grief express'd  Argos  with  Sparta  's and  Mycenae  's Towns  And  Calydon  yet free from fierce  Diana  's Frowns  Corinth  for finest Brass well fam'd of old  Orchomenos  for Men of Courage bold  Cleonae  lying in the lowly Dale  And rich  Messenè  with its fertile Vale  Pylos  for  Nestor  's City after fam'd  And  Troezen  not as yet from  Pittheus  nam'd  And those fair Cities which are hem'd around  By double Seas within the  Isthmian  Ground  And those which farther from the Seacoast stand  Lodg'd in the Bosom of the spacious Land  Who can believe it  Athens  was the last  Tho' for Politeness fam'd for Ages past  For a strait Siege which then their Walls enclos'd  Such Acts of kind Humanity oppos'd  And thick with Ships from foreign Nations bound  Seaward their City lay invested round  These with auxiliar Forces led from far  Tereus  of  Thrace  brave and inur'd to War  Had quite defeated and obtain'd a Name  The Warrior's Due among the Sons of  Fame  This with his Wealth and Pow'r and ancient Line  From  Mars  deriv'd  Pandion  's Thoughts incline  His Daughter  Procnè  with the Prince to joyn  Nor  Hymen  nor the  Graces  here preside  Nor  Juno  to befriend the blooming Bride  But  Fiends  with fun'ral Brands the Process led  And  Furies  waited at the  Genial  Bed  And all Night long the scrieching Owl aloof  With baleful Notes sate brooding o'er the Roof  With such ill  Omens  was the Match begun  That made them Parents of a hopeful Son  Now  Thrace  congratulates their seeming Joy  And they in thankful Rites their Minds employ  If the fair Queen's Espousals pleas'd before  Itys  the newborn Prince now pleases more  And each bright Day the Birth and Bridal Feast  Were kept with hallow'd Pomp above the rest  So far true Happiness may lye conceal'd  When by false Lights we fancy 'tis reveal'd  Now since their Nuptials had the golden Sun  Five Courses round his ample Zodiac run  When gentle  Procnè  thus her Lord address'd  And spoke the secret Wishes of her Breast  If I she said have ever Favour found  Let my Petition with Success be crown'd  Let me at  Athens  my dear Sister see  Or let her come to  Thrace  and visit me  And lest my Father should her Absence mourn  Promise that she shall make a quick Return  With Thanks I'd own the Obligation due  Only O  Tereus  to the Gods and you  Now ply'd with Oar and Sail at his Command  The nimble Gallies reach'd th'  Athenian  Land  And anchor'd in the fam'd  Piraean  Bay  While  Tereus  to the Palace takes his Way  The King salutes and Ceremonies past  Begins the fatal Embassy at last  The Occasion of his Voyage he declares  And with his own his Wife's Request prefers  Asks Leave that only for a little Space  Their lovely Sister might embark for  Thrace  Thus while he spoke appear'd the royal Maid  Bright  Philomela  splendidly array'd  But most attractive in her charming Face  And comely Person turn'd with ev'ry Grace  Like those fair  Nymphs  that are describ'd to rove  Across the Glades and Op'nings of the Grove  Only that these are dress'd for Silvan Sports  And less become the Finery of Courts  Tereus  beheld the Virgin and admir'd  And with the Coals of burning Lust was fir'd  Like crackling Stubble or the Summer Hay  When forked Lightnings o'er the Meadows play  Such Charms in any Breast might kindle Love  But him the Heats of inbred Lewdness move  To which tho'  Thrace  is naturally prone  Yet his is still superior and his own  Strait her Attendants he designs to buy  And with large Bribes her Governess would try  Herself with ample Gifts resolves to bend  And his whole Kingdom in th' Attempt expend  Or snatch'd away by Force of Arms to bear  And justify the Rape with open War  The boundless Passion boils within his Breast  And his projecting Soul admits no Rest  And now impatient of the least Delay  By pleading  Procnè  's Cause he speeds his Way  The Eloquence of Love his Tongue inspires  And in his Wife's he speaks his own Desires▪  Hence all his Importunities arise  And Tears unmanly trickle from his Eyes  Ye Gods what thick involving Darkness blinds  The stupid Faculties of mortal Minds  Tereus  the Credit of Goodnature gains  From these his Crimes so well the Villain feigns  And unsuspecting of his base Designs  In the Request fair  Philomela  joyns  Her snowy Arms her aged Sire embrace  And clasp his Neck with an endearing Grace  Only to see her Sister she entreats  A seeming Blessing which a Curse compleats  Tereus  surveys her with a luscious Eye  And in his Mind forestalls the blissful Joy  Her circling Arms a Scene of Lust inspire  And ev'ry Kiss foments the raging Fire  Fondly he wishes for the Father's Place  To feel and to return the warm Embrace  Since not the nearest Ties of filial Blood  Would damp his Flame and force him to be good  At length for both their sakes the King agrees  And  Philomela  on her bended Knees  Thanks him for what her Fancy calls Success  When cruel Fate intends her nothing less  Now  Phoebus  hasting to ambrosial Rest  His fiery Steeds drove sloping down the West  The sculptur'd Gold with sparkling Wines was fill'd  And with rich Meats each chearful Table smil'd  Plenty and Mirth the royal Banquet close  Then all retire to Sleep and sweet Repose  But the lewd Monarch tho' withdrawn apart  Still feels Love's Poison rankling in his Heart  Her Face Divine is stamp'd within his Breast  Fancy imagines and improves the rest  And thus kept waking by intense Desire  He nourishes his own prevailing Fire  Next Day the good old King for  Tereus  sends  And to his Charge the Virgin recommends  His Hand with Tears th' indulgent Father press'd  Then spoke and thus with Tenderness address'd  Since the kind Instances of pious Love  Do all Pretence of Obstacle remove  Since  Procnè  's and her own with your Request  O'errule the Fears of a Paternal Breast  With you dear Son my Daughter I entrust  And by the Gods adjure you to be just  By Truth and ev'ry consanguineal Tye  To watch and guard her with a Father's Eye  And since the least Delay will tedious prove  In keeping from my Sight the Child I love  With Speed return her kindly to asswage  The tedious Troubles of my lingring Age  And you my  Philomel  let it suffice  To know your Sister's banish'd from my Eyes  If any Sense of Duty sways your Mind  Let me from you the shortest Absence find  He wept then kiss'd his Child and while he speaks  The Tears fall gently down his aged Cheeks  Next as a Pledge of Fealty he demands  And with a solemn Charge conjoyns their Hands  Then to his Daughter and his Grandson sends  And by their Mouth a Blessing recommends  While in a Voice with dire Forebodings broke  Sobbing and faint the last Farewel was spoke  Now  Philomela  scarce receiv'd on Board  And in the royal gilded Bark secur'd  Beheld the Dashes of the bending Oar  The ruffled Sea and the receding Shore  When strait his Joy impatient of Disguise  We've gain'd our Point the rough  Barbarian  cries  Now I possess the dear the blissful Hour  And ev'ry Wish subjected to my Pow'r  Transports of Lust his vicious Thoughts employ  And he forbears with Pain th' expected Joy  His gloting Eyes incessantly survey'd  The Virgin Beauties of the lovely Maid  As when the bold rapacious Bird of  Jove    With crooked Talons stooping from above  Has snatcht and carry'd to his lofty Nest  A Captive Hare with cruel Gripes opprest  Secure with fix'd and unrelenting Eyes  He sits and views the helpless trembling Prize  Their Vessels now had made th' intended Land  And all with Joy descend upon the Strand  When the false Tyrant seiz'd the Princely Maid  And to a Lodge in distant Woods convey'd  Pale sinking and distress'd with jealous Fears  And asking for her Sister all in Tears  The Letcher for Enjoyment fully bent  No longer now conceal'd his base Intent  But with rude Haste the bloomy Girl deflowr'd  Tender defenceless and with Ease o'erpowr'd  Her piercing Accents to her Sire complain  And to her absent Sister but in vain  In vain she importunes with doleful Cries  Each unattentive Godhead of the Skies  She pants and trembles like the bleating Prey  From some closehunted Wolf just snatch'd away  That still with fearful Horror looks around  And on its Flank regards the bleeding Wound  Or as the tim'rous Dove the Danger o'er  Beholds her shining Plumes besmear'd with Gore  And tho' deliver'd from the Faulcon's Claw  Yet shivers and retains a secret Awe  But when her Mind a calm Reflection shar'd  And all her scatter'd Spirits were repair'd  Torn and disorder'd while her Tresses hung  Her livid Hands like one that mourn'd she wrung  Then thus with Grief o'erwhelm'd her languid Eyes  Savage inhumane cruel Wretch she cries  Whom nor a Parent's strict Commands could move  Tho' charg'd and utter'd with the Tears of Love  Nor Virgin Innocence nor all that's due  To the strong Contract of the Nuptial Vow  Virtue by this in wild Confusion's laid  And I compell'd to wrong my Sister's Bed  Whilst you regardless of your Marriage Oath  With Stains of Incest have defil'd us Both  Tho' I deserv'd some Punishment to find  This was ye Gods too cruel and unkind  Yet Villain to compleat your horrid Guilt  Stab here and let my tainted Blood be spilt  Oh happy had it come before I knew  The curs'd Embrace of vile perfidious you  Then my pale Ghost pure from incestuous Love  Had wander'd spotless thro' th'  Elysian  Grove  But if the Gods above have Pow'r to know  And judge those Actions that are done below  Unless the dreaded Thunders of the Sky  Like me subdu'd and violated lye  Still my Revenge shall take its proper Time  And suit the Baseness of your hellish Crime  My self abandon'd and devoid of Shame  Thro' the wide World your Actions will proclaim  Or tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely Den  Obscur'd and bury'd from the Sight of Men  My mournful Voice the pitying Rocks shall move  And my Complainings eccho thro' the Grove  Hear me O Heav'n and if a God be there  Let him regard me and accept my Pray'r  Struck with these Words the Tyrant's guilty Breast  With Fear and Anger was by turns possest  Now with Remorse his Conscience deeply stung  He drew the Faulchion that beside him hung  And first her tender Arms behind her bound  Then drag'd her by the Hair along the Ground  The Princess willingly her Throat reclin'd  And view'd the Steel with a contented Mind  But soon her Tongue the girding Pinchers strain  With Anguish soon she feels the piercing Pain  Oh Father Father she would fain have spoke  But the sharp Torture her Intention broke  In vain she tries for now the Blade has cut  Her Tongue sheer off close to the trembling Root  The mangled Part still quiver'd on the Ground  Murmuring with a faint imperfect Sound  And as a Serpent writhes his wounded Train  Uneasy panting and possess'd with Pain  The Piece while Life remain'd still trembled fast  And to its Mistress pointed to the last  Yet after this so damn'd and black a Deed  Fame which I scarce can credit has agreed  That on her rifled Charms still void of Shame  He frequently indulg'd his lustful Flame  At last he ventures to his  Procnè  's Sight  Loaded with Guilt and cloy'd with long Delight  There with feign'd Grief and false dissembled Sighs  Begins a formal Narrative of Lies  Her Sister's Death he artfully declares  Then weeps and raises Credit from his Tears  Her Vest with Flow'rs of Gold embroider'd o'er  With Grief distress'd the mournful Matron tore  And a beseeming Suit of gloomy Sable wore  With Cost an honorary Tomb she rais'd  And thus th' imaginary Ghost appeas'd  Deluded Queen the Fate of her you love  Nor Grief nor Pity but Revenge should move  Thro' the twelve Signs had pass'd the circling Sun  And round the Compass of the  Zodiac  run  What must unhappy  Philomela  do  For ever subject to her Keeper's View  Huge Walls of massy Stone the Lodge surround  From her own Mouth no way of speaking's found  But all our Wants by Wit may be supply'd  And Art makes up what Fortune has deny'd  With Skill exact a  Phrygian  Web she strung  Fix'd to a Loom that in her Chamber hung  Where inwrought Letters upon White display'd  In purple Notes her wretched Case betray'd  The Piece when finish'd secretly she gave  Into the Charge of one poor menial Slave  And then with Gestures made him understand  It must be safe convey'd to  Procnè  's Hand  The Slave with Speed the Queen's Apartment sought  And render'd up his Charge unknowing what he brought  But when the Cyphers figur'd in each Fold  Her Sister's melancholy Story told  Strange that she could with Silence she survey'd  The tragick Piece and without weeping read  In such tumultuous Haste her Passions sprung  They choak'd her Voice and quite disarm'd her Tongue  No Room for female Tears the  Furies  rise  Darting vindictive Glances from her Eyes  And stung with Rage she bounds from Place to Place  While stern Revenge sits low'ring in her Face  Now the triennial Celebration came  Observ'd to  Bacchus  by each  Thracian  Dame  When in the Privacies of Night retir'd  They act his Rites with sacred Rapture fir'd  By Night the twinkling Cymbals ring around  While the shrill Notes from  Rhodopè  resound  By Night the Queen disguis'd forsakes the Court  To mingle in the Festival Resort  Leafs of the curling Vine her Temples shade  And with a circling Wreath adorn her Head  Adown her Back the Stag's rough Spoils appear  Light on her Shoulder leans a Cornel Spear  Thus in the Fury of the God conceal'd  Procnè  her own mad headstrong Passion veil'd  Now with her Gang to the thick Wood she flies  And with religious Yellings fills the Skies  The fatal Lodge as 'twere by chance she seeks  And thro' the bolted Doors an Entrance breaks  From thence her Sister snatching by the Hand  Mask'd like the ranting  Bacchanalian  Band  Within the Limits of the Court she drew  Shading with Ivy green her outward Hue  But  Philomela  conscious of the Place  Felt new reviving Pangs of her Disgrace  A shiv'ring Cold prevail'd in ev'ry Part  And the chill'd Blood ran trembling to her Heart  Soon as the Queen a fit Retirement found  Stript of the Garlands that her Temples crown'd  She strait unveil'd her blushing Sister's Face  And fondly clasp'd her with a close Embrace  But in Confusion lost th' unhappy Maid  With Shame dejected hung her drooping Head  As guilty of a Crime that stain'd her Sister's Bed  That Speech that should her injur'd Virtue clear  And make her spotless Innocence appear  Is now no more only her Hands and Eyes  Appeal in Signals to the conscious Skies  In  Procnè  's Breast the rising Passions boil  And burst in Anger with a mad Recoil  Her Sister's illtim'd Grief with Scorn she blames  Then in these furious Words her Rage proclaims  Tears unavailing but defer our Time  The stabbing Sword must expiate the Crime  Or worse if Wit on bloody Vengeance bent  A Weapon more tormenting can invent  O Sister I've prepar'd my stubborn Heart  To act some hellish and unheardof Part  Either the Palace to surround with Fire  And see the Villain in the Flames expire  Or with a Knife dig out his cursed Eyes  Or his false Tongue with racking Engines seize  Or cut away the Part that injur'd you  And thro' a thousand Wounds his guilty Soul pursue  Tortures enough my Passion has design'd  But the Variety distracts my Mind  A while thus wav'ring stood the furious Dame  When  Itys  fondling to his Mother came  From him the cruel fatal Hint she took  She view'd him with a stern remorseless Look  Ah but too like thy wicked Sire she said  Forming the direful Purpose in her Head  At this a sullen Grief her Voice supprest  While silent Passions struggle in her Breast  Now at her Lap arriv'd the flatt'ring Boy  Salutes his Parent with a smiling Joy  About her Neck his little Arms are thrown  And he accosts her in a pratling Tone  Then her tempestuous Anger was allay'd  And in its full Career her Vengeance stay'd  While tender Thoughts in spite of Passion rise  And melting Tears disarm her threat'ning Eyes  But when she found the Mother's easy Heart  Too fondly swerving from th' intended Part  Her injur'd Sister's Face again she view'd  And as by turns surveying Both she stood  While this fond Boy she said can thus express  The moving Accents of his fond Address  Why stands my Sister of her Tongue bereft  Forlorn and sad in speechless Silence left  O  Procnè  see the Fortune of your House  Such is your Fate when match'd to such a Spouse  Conjugal Duty if observ'd to him  Would change from Virtue and become a Crime  For all Respect to  Tereus  must debase  The noble Blood of Great  Pandion  's Race  Strait at these Words with big Resentment fill'd  Furious her Look she flew and seiz'd her Child  Like a fell Tigress of the savage Kind  That drags the tender Suckling of the Hind  Thro'  India  's gloomy Groves where  Ganges  laves  The shady Scene and rouls his streamy Waves  Now to a close Apartment they were come  Far off retir'd within the spacious Dome  When  Procnè  on revengeful Mischief bent  Home to his Heart a piercing Poinyard sent  Itys  with rueful Cries but all too late  Holds out his Hands and deprecates his Fate  Still at his Mother's Neck he fondly aims  And strives to melt her with endearing Names  Yet still the cruel Mother perseveres  Nor with Concern his bitter Anguish hears  This might suffice but  Philomela  too  Across his Throat a shining Curtlass drew  Then Both with Knives dissect each quiv'ring Part  And carve the butcher'd Limbs with cruel Art  Which whelm'd in boiling Cauldrons o'er the Fire  Or turn'd on Spits in steamy Smoak aspire  While the long Entries with their slipp'ry Floor  Run down in purple Streams of clotted Gore  Ask'd by his Wife to this inhuman Feast  Tereus  unknowingly is made a Guest  Whilst she her Plot the better to disguise  Stiles it some unknown mystick Sacrifice  And such the Nature of the hallow'd Rite  The Wife her Husband only could invite  The Slaves must all withdraw and be debarr'd the Sight  Tereus  upon a Throne of antique State  Loftily rais'd before the Banquet sate  And Glutton like luxuriously pleas'd  With his own Flesh his hungry Maw appeas'd  Nay such a Blindness o'er his Senses falls  That he for  Itys  to the Table calls  When  Procnè  now impatient to disclose  The Joy that from her full Revenge arose  Cries out in Transports of a cruel Mind  Within your self your  Itys  you may find  Still at this puzzling Answer with Surprise  Around the Room he sends his curious Eyes  And as he still inquir'd and call'd aloud  Fierce  Philomela  all besmear'd with Blood  Her Hands with Murder stain'd her spreading Hair  Hanging dishevel'd with a ghastly Air  Stept forth and flung full in the Tyrant's Face  The Head of  Itys  goary as it was  Nor ever long'd so much to use her Tongue  And with a just Reproach to vindicate her Wrong  The  Thracian  Monarch from the Table flings  While with his Cries the vaulted Parlour rings  His Imprecations eccho down to Hell  And rouze the snaky  Furies  from their  Stygian  Cell  One while he labours to disgorge his Breast  And free his Stomach from the cursed Feast  Then weeping o'er his lamentable Doom  He stiles himself his Son's sepulchral Tomb  Now with drawn Sabre and impetuous Speed  In close Pursuit he drives  Pandion  's Breed  Whose nimble Feet spring with so swift a Force  Across the Fields they seem to wing their Course  And now on real Wings themselves they raise  And steer their airy Flight by diff'rent Ways  One to the Woodland's shady Covert hies  Around the smoaky Roof the other flies  Whose Feathers yet the Marks of Murder stain  Where stampt upon her Breast the crimson Spots remain  Tereus  through Grief and Haste to be reveng'd  Shares the like Fate and to a Bird is chang'd  Fix'd on his Head the crested Plumes appear  Long is his Beak and sharpen'd like a Spear  Thus arm'd his Looks his inward Mind display  And to a Lapwing turn'd he fans his Way  Exceeding Trouble for his Childrens Fate  Shorten'd  Pandion  's Days and chang'd his Date  Down to the Shades below with Sorrow spent  An earlier unexpected Ghost he went  BOREAS in Love  Erechtheus  next th'  Athenian  Sceptre sway'd  Whose Rule the State with joynt Consent obey'd  So mix'd his Justice with his Valour flow'd  His Reign one Scene of Princely Goodness shew'd  Four hopeful Youths as many Females bright  Sprung from his Loyns and sooth'd him with Delight  Two of these Sisters of a lovelier Air  Excell'd the rest tho' all the rest were fair  Procris  to  Cephalus  in Wedlock ty'd  Bless'd the young Silvan with a blooming Bride  For  Orithyia Boreas  suffer'd Pain  For the coy Maid sue'd long but sue'd in vain  Tereus  his Neighbour and his  Thracian  Blood  Against the Match a main Objection stood  Which made his Vows and all his suppliant Love  Empty as Air and ineffectual prove  But when he found his soothing Flatt'ries fail  Nor saw his soft Addresses cou'd avail  Blust'ring with Ire he quickly has Recourse  To rougher Arts and his own native Force  'Tis well he said such Usage is my Due  When thus disguis'd by foreign ways I sue  When my stern Airs and Fierceness I disclaim  And sigh for Love ridiculously tame  When soft Addresses foolishly I try  Nor my own stronger Remedies apply  By Force and Violence I chiefly live  By them the lowring stormy Tempests drive  In foaming Billows raise the hoary Deep  Writhe knotted Oaks and sandy Desarts sweep  Congeal the falling Flakes of fleecy Snow  And bruise with rattling Hail the Plains below  I and my BrotherWinds when joyn'd above  Thro' the waste Champian of the Skies we rove  With such a boist'rous full Career engage  That Heav'n's whole Concave thunders at our Rage  While struck from nitrous Clouds fierce Lightnings play  Dart thro' the Storm and gild the gloomy Day  Or when in subterraneous Caverns pent  My Breath against the hollow Earth is bent  The quaking World above and Ghosts below  My mighty Pow'r by dear Experience know  Tremble with Fear and dread the fatal Blow  This is the only Cure to be apply'd  Thus to  Erechtheus  I should be ally'd  And thus the scornful Virgin should be woo'd  Not by Intreaty but by Force subdu'd  Boreas  in Passion spoke these huffing things  And as he spoke he shook his dreadful Wings  At which afar the shiv'ring Sea was fan'd  And the wide Surface of the distant Land  His dusty Mantle o'er the Hills he drew  And swept the lowly Vallies as he flew  Then with his yellow Wings embrac'd the Maid  And wrapt in dusky Clouds far off convey'd  The sparkling Blaze of Love's prevailing Fire  Shone brighter as he flew and flam'd the higher  And now the God possess'd of his Delight  To Northern  Thrace  pursu'd his airy Flight  Where the young ravish'd Nymph became his Bride  And soon the luscious Sweets of Wedlock try'd  Two lovely Twins th' Effect of this Embrace  Crown their soft Labours and their Nuptials grace▪  Who like their Mother beautiful and fair  Their Father's Strength and feather'd Pinions share  Yet these at first were wanting as 'tis said  And after as they grew their Shoulders spread  Zethes  and  Calaïs  the pretty Twins  Remain'd unfledg'd while smooth their beardless Chins  But when in Time the budding silver Down  Shaded their Face and on their Cheeks was grown  Two sprouting Wings upon their Shoulders sprung  Like those in Birds that veil the callow Young  Then as their Age advanc'd and they began  From greener Youth to ripen into Man  With  Jason  's  Argonauts  they cross'd the Seas  Embark'd in quest of the fam'd Golden Fleece  There with the rest the first frail Vessel try'd  And boldly ventur'd on the swelling Tide  The End of the Sixth

Harpyes  from the Monarch's Table chase  With  Jason  then they greater Toils sustain  And  Phasis  ' slimy Banks at last they gain  Here boldly they demand the Golden Prize  Of  Scythia  's King who sternly thus replies  That mighty Labours they must first o'ercome  Or sail their  Argo  thence unfreighted home  Mean while  Medea  seiz'd with fierce Desire  By Reason strives to quench the raging Fire  But strives in vainSome God she said withstands  And Reason's baffl'd Council countermands  What unseen Pow'r does this Disorder move  'Tis Loveat least 'tis like what Men call Love  Else wherefore shou'd the King's Commands appear  To me too hardBut so indeed they are  Why shou'd I for a Stranger fear lest he  Shou'd perish whom I did but lately see  His Death or Safety what are they to me  Wretch from thy VirginBreast this Flame expel  And soonOh cou'd I all wou'd then be well  But Love resistless Love my Soul invades  Discretion this Affection that perswades  I see the Right and I approve it too  Condemn the Wrongand yet the Wrong pursue  Why Royal Maid shou'dst thou desire to wed  A Wanderer and court a foreign Bed  Thy native Land tho' barb'rous can present  A Bridegroom

just a Suit may for the Guiltless move  Whom wou'd not  Jason  's Valour Youth and Blood  Invite or cou'd these Merits be withstood  At least his charming Person must encline  The hardest HeartI'm sure 'tis so with mine  Yet if I help him not the flaming Breath  Of Bulls and Earthborn Foes must be his Death  Or should he through these Dangers force his way  At last he must be made the Dragon's Prey  If no Remorse for such Distress I feel  I am a Tigress and my Breast is Steel  Why do I scruple then to see him slain  And with the tragick Scene my Eyes prophane  My Magick's Art employ not to asswage  The  Salvages  but to enflame their Rage  His Earthborn Foes to fiercer Fury move  And accessary to his Murder prove  The Gods forbidBut Pray'rs are idle Breath  When Action only can prevent

Hopes bereft  But to unpity'd Punishment am left  If he is false let the Ingrateful bleed  But no such Symptom in his Looks I read  Nature wou'd ne'er have lavish'd so much Grace  Upon his Person if his Soul were base  Besides he first shall plight his Faith and swear  By all the Gods what therefore can'st thou fear  Medea  haste from Danger set him free  Jason  shall thy eternal Debtor be  And

Train before her Eyes  Present themselves and vanquish'd  Cupid  flies  She then retires to  Hecate  's Shrine that stood  Far in the Covert of a shady Wood  She finds the Fury of her Flames asswag'd  But seeing  Jason  there again they rag'd  Blushes and Paleness did by turns invade  Her tender Cheeks and secret Grief betray'd  As Fire that sleeping under Ashes lyes  Freshblown and rouz'd does up in Blazes rise  So flam'd the Virgin's Breast  New kindled by her Lover's sparkling Eyes  For Chance that Day had with uncommon Grace  Adorn'd the lovely Youth and through his Face  Display'd an Air so pleasing as might charm  A Goddess and a Vestal's Bosom warm  Her ravish'd Eyes survey him o'er and o'er  As some gay Wonder never seen before  Transported to the Skies she seems to be  And thinks she gazes on a Deity  But when he spoke and prest her trembling Hand  And did with tender Words her Aid demand  With Vows and Oaths to make her soon his Bride  She wept a Flood of Tears and thus reply'd  I see my Error yet to Ruin move  Nor owe my Fate to Ignorance but Love  Your Life I'll guard and only crave of you  To swear once moreand to your Oath be true  He swears by  Hecate  he would all fulfil  And by her Grandfather's prophetick Skill  By ev'ry thing that doubting Love cou'd press  His present Danger and desir'd Success  She credits him and kindly does produce  Enchanted Herbs and teaches him their use  Their mystick Names and Virtues he admires▪  And with his Booty joyfully retires  The Dragon's Teeth transform'd to Men  Impatient for the Wonders of the Day  Aurora  drives the loyt'ring Stars away  Now  Mars  's Mount the pressing People fill  The Crowd below the Nobles crown the Hill  The King himself highthron'd above the rest  With Iv'ry Scepter and in Purple drest  Forthwith the Brasshoof'd Bulls are set at large  Whose furious Nostrils sulph'rous Flame discharge  The blasted Herbage by their Breath expires  As Forges rumble with excessive Fires  And Furnaces with fiercer Fury glow  When Water on the panting Mass ye throw  With such a Noise from their Convulsive Breast  Thro' bellowing Throats the struggling Vapour prest  Yet  Jason  marches up without Concern  While on th' advent'rous Youth the Monsters turn  Their glaring Eyes and eager to engage  Brandish their Steeltipt Horns in threat'ning Rage  With brazen Hoofs they beat the Ground and choak  The ambient Air with Clouds of Dust and Smoak  Each gazing  Graecian  for his Champion shakes  While bold Advances he securely makes  Thro' sindging Blasts such Wonders Magick Art  Can work when Love conspires and plays his Part  The passive Savages like Statutes stand  While he their Dewlaps stroaks with soothing Hand  To unknown Yoaks their brawny Necks they yield  And like tame Oxen plow the wond'ring Field  The  Colchians  stare the  Graecians  shout and raise  Their Champion's Courage with inspiring Praise  Embolden'd now on fresh Attempts he goes  With Serpent's Teeth the fertile Furrows sows  The Glebe fermenting with inchanted Juice  Makes the Snake's Teeth a human Crop produce  For as an Infant Pris'ner to the Womb  Contented sleeps till to Perfection come  Then does his Cell's obscure Confinement scorn  He tosses throbs and presses to be born  So from the lab'ring Earth no single Birth  But a whole Troop of lusty Youths rush forth  And what's more strange with Martial Fury warm'd  And for Encounter all compleatly arm'd  In Rank and File as they were sow'd they stand  Impatient for the Signal of Command  No Foe but the  Aemonian  Youth appears  At him they level their Steelpointed Spears  His frighted Friends who triumph'd just before  With Peals of Sighs his desp'rate Case deplore  And where such hardy Warriors are afraid  What must the tender and enamour'd Maid  Her Spirits sink the Blood her Check forsook  She fears who for his Safety undertook  She knew the Vertue of the Spells she gave  She knew their Force and knew her Lover brave  But what's a single Champion to an Host  Yet scorning thus to see him tamely lost  Her strong Reserve of secret Arts she brings  And last her neverfailing Song she sings  Wonders ensue among his gazing Foes  The massy Fragment of a Rock he throws  This Charm in Civil War engag'd 'em all  By mutual Wounds those Earthborn Brothers fall  The  Greeks  transported with the strange Success  Leap from their Seats the Conqu'ror to caress  Commend and kiss and clasp him in their Arms  So would the kind Contriver of the Charms  But her who felt the tenderest Concern  Honour condemns in secret Flames to burn  Committed to a double Guard of Fame  Aw'd by a Virgin's and a Princess' Name  But Thoughts are free and Fancy unconfin'd  She kisses courts and hugs him in her Mind  To fav'ring Pow'rs her silent Thanks she gives  By whose Indulgence her lov'd Heroe lives  One Labour more remains and tho' the last  In Danger far surmounting all the past  That Enterprize by Fates in store was kept  To make the Dragon sleep that never slept  Whose Crest shoots dreadful Lustre from his Jaws  A tripple Tire of forked Stings he draws  With Fangs and Wings of a prodigious Size  Such was the Guardian of the Golden Prize  Yet him besprinkled with  Lethaean  Dew  The fair Inchantress into Slumber threw  And then to fix him thrice she did repeat  The Rhyme that makes the raging Winds retreat  In stormy Seas can halcyon Seasons make  Turn rapid Streams into a standing Lake  While the soft Guest his drowzy Eyelids seals  Th'unguarded Golden Fleece the Stranger steals  Proud to possess the Purchase of his Toil  Proud of his Royal Bride the richer Spoil  To Sea both Prize and Patroness he bore  And Lands triumphant on his native Shore  Old AESON restor'd to Youth  Aemonian  Matrons who their Absence mourn'd  Rejoyce to see their prosp'rous Sons return'd  Rich curling Fumes of Incense feast the Skies  An Hecatomb of voted Victims dies  With gilded Horns and Garlands on their Head  And all the Pomp of Death to th' Altar led  Congratulating Bowls go briskly round  Triumphant Shouts in louder Musick drown'd  Amidst these Revels why that Cloud of Care  On  Jason  's Brow to whom the largest Share  Of Mirth was dueHis Father was not there  Aeson  was absent once the Young and Brave  Now crush'd with Years and bending to the Grave  At last withdrawn and by the Crowd unseen  Pressing her Hand with starting Sighs between  He supplicates his kind and skilful Queen  O Patroness Preserver of my Life  Dear when my Mistress and much dearer Wife  Your Favours to so vast a Sum amount  'Tis past the Pow'r of Numbers to recount  Or cou'd they be to Computation brought  The History would a Romance be thought  And yet unless you add one Favour more  Greater than all that you conferr'd before  But not too hard for Love and Magick Skill  Your past are thrown away and  Jason  's wretched still  The Morning of my Life is just begun  But my declining Father's Race is run  From my large Stock retrench the long Arrears  And add 'em to expiring  Aeson  's Years  Thus spake the gen'rous Youth and wept the rest  Mov'd with the Piety of his Request  To his ag'd Sire such filial Duty shown  So diff'rent from her Treatment of her own  But still endeav'ring her Remorse to hide  She check'd her rising Sighs and thus reply'd  How cou'd the Thought of such inhuman Wrong  Escape said she from pious  Jason  's Tongue  Does the whole World another  Jason  bear  Whose Life  Medea  can to yours prefer  Or cou'd I with so dire a Change dispence  Hecat  will never join in that Offence  Unjust is the Request you make and I  In Kindness your Petition shall deny  Yet she that grants not what you do implore  Shall yet essay to give her  Jason  more  Find Means t'encrease the Stock of  Aeson  's Years  Without Retrenchment of your Life's Arrears  Provided that the Tripple Goddess join  A strong Confed'rate in my bold Design  Thus was her Enterprize resolv'd but still  Three tedious Nights are wanting to fulfil  The circling Crescents of th' encreasing Moon  Then in the Height of her Nocturnal Noon  Medea  steals from Court her Ankles bare  Her Garments closely girt but loose her Hair  Thus sally'd like a solitary Sprite  She traverses the Terrors of the Night  Men Beasts and Birds in soft Repose lay charm'd  No boistrous Wind the MountainWoods alarm'd  Nor did those Walks of Love the Myrtle Trees  Of am'rous  Zephyr  hear the whisp'ring Breeze  All Elements chain'd in unactive Rest  No Sense but what the twinkling Stars exprest  To them that only wak'd she rears her Arms  And thus commences her mysterious Charms  She turn'd her thrice about as oft she threw  On her pale Tresses the Nocturnal Dew  Then yelling thrice a most enormous Sound  Her bare Knee bended on the flinty Ground  O Night said she thou Confident and Guide  Of Secrets such as Darkness ought to hide  Ye Stars and Moon that when the Sun retires  Support his Empire with succeeding Fires  And thou great  Hecat  Friend to my Design  Songs mutt'ring Spells your magick Forces join  And thou O Earth the Magazine that yields  The Midnight Sorcerer Drugs Skies Mountains Fields  Ye watr'y Pow'rs of Fountain Stream and Lake  Ye Sylvan Gods and Gods of Night awake  And gen'rously your Parts in my Adventure take  Oft by your Aid swift Currents I have led  Thro' wandring Banks back to their Fountain Head  Transform'd the Prospect of the briny Deep  Made sleeping Billows rave and raving Billows sleep  Made Clouds or Sunshine Tempests rise or fall  And stubborn lawless Winds obey my Call  With mutter'd Words disarm'd the Viper's Jaw  Up by the Roots vast Oaks and Rocks cou'd draw  Make Forests dance and trembling Mountains come  Like Malefactors to receive their Doom  Earth groan and frighted Ghosts forsake their Tomb  Thee  Cynthia  my resistless Rhymes drew down  When tinkling Cymbals strove my Voice to drown  Nor stronger  Titan  could their Force sustain  In full Career compell'd to stop his Wain  Nor could  Aurora  's Virgin Blush avail  With pois'nous Herbs I turn'd her Roses pale  The Fury of the fiery Bulls I broke  Their stubborn Necks submitting to my Yoke  And when the Sons of Earth with Fury burn'd  Their hostile Rage upon themselves I turn'd  The Brothers made with mutual Wounds to bleed  And by their fatal Strife my Lover freed  And while the Dragon slept to distant  Greece    Thro' cheated Guards convey'd the Golden Fleece  But now to bolder Action I proceed  Of such prevailing Juices now have need  That wither'd Years back to their Bloom can bring  And in dead Winter raise a second Spring  And you'll perform't  You will for lo the Stars with sparkling Fires  Presage as bright Success to my Desires  And now another happy Omen see  A Chariot drawn by Dragons waits for me  With these last Words she leaps into the Wain  Stroaks the Snakes Necks and shakes the Golden Rein  That Signal giv'n they mount her to the Skies  And now beneath her fruitful  Tempè  lies  Whose Stores she ransacks then to  Crete  she flies  There  Ossa    Pelion    Othrys    Pindus  all  To the fair Ravisher a Booty fall  The Tribute of their Verdure she collects  Nor proud  Olympus  Height his Plants protects  Some by the Roots she plucks the tender Tops  Of others with her culling Sickle crops  Nor could the Plunder of the Hills suffice  Down to the humble Vales and Meads she flies  Apidanus    Amphrysus  the next Rape  Sustain nor could  Enipeus  ' Banks escape  Thro'  Beebè  's Marsh and thro' the Border rang'd  Whose Pasture  Glaucus  to a Triton chang'd  Now the Ninth Day and Ninth successive Night  Had wonder'd at the restless Rover's Flight  Mean while her Dragons fed with no Repast  But her exhaling Simples od'rous Blast  Their tarnish'd Scales and wrinkled Skins had cast  At last return'd before her Palace Gate  Quitting her Chariot on the Ground she sate  The Sky her only Canopy of State  All Conversation with her Sex she fled  Shun'd the Caresses of the Nuptial Bed  Two Altars next of grassy Turf she rears  This  Hecat  's Name that  Youth  's Inscription bears  With ForestBoughs and Vervain these she crown'd  Then delves a double Trench in lower Ground  And sticks a blackfleec'd Ram that ready stood  And drench'd the Ditches with devoted Blood  New Wine she pours and Milk from th' Udder warm  With mystick Murmurs to compleat the Charm  And subterranean Deities alarm  To the stern King of Ghosts she next apply'd  And gentle  Proserpine  his ravish'd Bride  That for old  Aeson  with the Laws of Fate  They would dispense and lengthen his short Date  Thus with repeated Pray'rs she long assails  Th' Infernal Tyrant and at last prevails  Then calls to have decrepit  Aeson  brought  And stupifies him with a sleeping Draught  On Earth his Body like a Corpse extends  Then charges  Jason  and his waiting Friends  To quit the Place that no unhallow'd Eye  Into her Art's forbidden Secrets pry  This done th' Inchantress with her Locks unbound  About her Altars trips a frantick Round  Piecemeal the consecrated Wood she splits  And dips the Splinters in the bloody Pits  Then hurls 'em on the Piles the sleeping Sire  She lustrates thrice with Sulphur Water Fire  In a large Cauldron now the Med'cine boils  Compounded of her late collected Spoils  Blending into the Mesh the various Pow'rs  Of Wonderworking Juices Roots and Flow'rs  With Gems i' th' Eastern Ocean's Cell refin'd  And such as ebbing Tides had left behind  To them the Midnight's pearly Dew she flings  A ScreetchOwl's Carcass and ill boding Wings  Nor could the Wizard Wolf's warm Entrails scape  That Wolf who counterfeits a Human Shape  Then from the Bottom of her conj'ring Bag  Snakes Skins and Liver of a longliv'd Stag  Last a Crow's Head to such an Age arriv'd  That he had now nine Centuries surviv'd  These and with these a thousand more that grew  In sundry Soils into her Pot she threw  Then with a wither'd OliveBough she rakes  The bubling Broth the Bough fresh Verdure takes  Green Leaves at first the perish'd Plant surround  Which the next Minute with ripe Fruit were crown'd  The foaming Juices now the Brink o'erswell  The barren Heath wheree'er the Liquor fell  Sprang out with vernal Grass and all the Pride  Of blooming  May  When this  Medea  spy'd  She cuts her Patient's Throat th'exhausted Blood  Recruiting with her new enchanted Flood  While at his Mouth and thro' his op'ning Wound  A double Inlet her Infusion found  His feeble Frame resumes a youthful Air  A glossy Brown his hoary Beard and Hair  The meager Paleness from his Aspect fled  And in its Room sprang up a florid Red  Thro' all his Limbs a youthful Vigour flies  His empty'd Art'ries swell with fresh Supplies  Gazing Spectators scarce believe their Eyes  But  Aeson  is the most surpriz'd to find  A happy Change in Body and in Mind  In Sense and Constitution the same Man  As when his Fortieth active Year began  Bacchus  who from the Clouds this Wonder view'd  Medea  's Method instantly pursu'd  And his indulgent Nurse's Youth renew'd  The Death of PELIAS  Thus far obliging Love employ'd her Art  But now Revenge must act a tragick Part  Medea  feigns a mortal Quarrel bred  Betwixt her and the Partner of her Bed  On this Pretence to  Pelia  's Court she flies  Who languishing with Age and Sickness lies  His innocent Daughters with inveigling Wiles  And welldissembled Friendship she beguiles  The strange Atchievements of her Art she tells  With  Aeson  's Cure and long on that she dwells  Till them to firm Perswasion she has won  The same for their old Father may be done  For him they court her to employ her Skill  And put upon the Cure what Price she will  At first she's mute and with a grave Pretence  Of Difficulty holds 'em in Suspense  Then promises and bids 'em from the Fold  Chuse out a Ram the most infirm and old  That so by Fact their Doubts may be remov'd  And first on him the Operation prov'd  A wreathhorn'd Ram is brought so far o'ergrown  With Years his Age was to that Age unknown  Of Sense too dull the piercing Point to feel  And scarce sufficient Blood to stain the Steel  His Carcass she into a Cauldron threw  With Drugs whose vital Qualities she knew  His Limbs grow less he casts his Horns and Years  And tender Bleatings strike their wondring Ears  Then instantly leaps forth a frisking Lamb  That seeks too young to graze a suckling Dam  The Sisters thus confirm'd with the Success  Her Promise with renew'd Entreaty press  To countenance the Cheat three Nights and Days  Before Experiment th' Inchantress stays  Then into limpid Water from the Springs  Weeds and Ingredients of no Force she flings  With antique Ceremonies for Pretence  And rambling Rhymes without a Word of Sense  Mean while the King with all his Guards lay bound  In Magick Sleep scarce that of Death so sound  The Daughters now are by the Sorc'ress led  Into his Chamber and surround his Bed  Your Father's Health's concern'd and can ye stay  Unnat'ral Nymphs why this unkind Delay  Unsheath your Swords dismiss his lifeless Blood  And I'll recruit it with a vital Flood  Your Father's Life and Health is in your Hand  And can ye thus like idle Gazers stand  Unless you are of common Sense bereft  If yet one Spark of Piety is left  Dispatch a Father's Cure and disengage  The Monarch from his toilsome Load of Age  Comedrench your Weapons in his putrid Gore  'Tis Charity to wound when Wounding will restore  Thus urg'd the poor deluded Maids proceed  Betray'd by Zeal to an inhumane Deed  And in Compassion make a Father bleed  Yes she who had the kindest tend'rest Heart  Is foremost to perform the bloody Part  Yet tho' to act the Butchery betray'd  They could not bear to see the Wounds they made  With Looks averted backward they advance  Then strike and stab and leave the Blows to Chance  Waking in Consternation he essays  Weltring in Blood his feeble Arms to raise  Environ'd with so many Swordsfrom whence  This barb'rous Usage what is my Offence  What fatal Fury what infernal Charm  Gainst a kind Father does his Daughters arm  Hearing his Voice as Thunderstruck they stopt  Their Resolution and their Weapons dropt  Medea  then the mortal Blow bestows  And that perform'd the tragick Scene to close  His Corpse into the boiling Cauldron throws  Then dreading the Revenge that must

Instead of falling to behold him rise  A snowy Swan and soaring to the Skies  But dearly the rash Prank his Mother cost  Who ignorantly gave her Son for lost  For his Misfortune wept till she became

Arrives at Court but to his Sire unknown  Medea  to dispatch a dang'rous Heir  She knew him did a pois'nous Draught prepare  Drawn from a Drug was long reserv'd in store  For desp'rate Uses from the  Scythian  Shore  That from the  Echydnaean  Monster's Jaws  Deriv'd it's Origin and this the Cause  Thro' a dark Cave a craggy Passage lies  To ours ascending from the nether Skies  Thro' which by Strength of Hand  Alcides  drew  Chain'd  Cerberus  who lagg'd and restive grew  With his blear'd Eyes our brighter Day to view  Thrice he repeated his enormous Yell  With which he scares the Ghosts

more active Charms  A Whirlwind rais'd that snatch'd her from his Arms  While conjur'd Clouds their baffled Sense surprize  She vanishes from their deluded Eyes  And thro' the Hurricane triumphant flies  The gen'rous King altho' o'erjoy'd to find  His Son was safe yet bearing still in mind  The Mischief by his treach'rous Queen design'd  The Horrour of the Deed and then how near  The Danger

bore  And prosp'rous Passage to  O Enopia  's Shore  O Enopia  once but now  Aegina  call'd  And with his Royal Mother's Name install'd  By  Aeacus  under whose Reign did spring  The  Myrmidons  and now their reigning King  Down to the Port amidst the Rabble run  The Princes of the Blood with  Telamon    Peleus  the next and  Phocus  the third Son  Then  Aeacus  altho' opprest with Years  To ask the Cause of their Approach appears  That Question does the  Gnossian  's Grief renew  And Sighs from his afflicted Bosom drew  Yet after a short solemn Respite made  The Ruler of the hundred Cities said  Assist our Arms rais'd for a murder'd Son  In this religious War no Risque you'll run  Revenge the Deadfor who refuse to give  Rest to their Urns unworthy are to live  What you request thus  Aeacus  replies  Not I but Truth and common Faith denies  Athens  and we have long been sworn Allies  Our Leagues are fix'd confed'rate are our Pow'rs  And who declare themselves Their Foes are Ours  Minos  rejoins Your League shall dearly cost  Yet mindful how much safer 'twas to boast  Than there to waste his Forces and his Fame  Before in Field with his grand Foe he came  Parts without BlowsNor

His Embassy from the  Athenian  State  Their mutual Friendship Leagues of ancient Date  Their common Danger ev'ry thing cou'd wake  Concern and his Address successful make  Strength'ning his Plea with all the Charms of Sense  And those with all the Charms of Eloquence  Then thus the King Like Suiters do you stand  For that Assistance which you may command  Athenians  all our listed Forces use  They're such as no bold Service will refuse  And when y'ave drawn them off the Gods be prais'd  Fresh Legions can within our Isle be rais'd  So stock'd with People that we can prepare  Both for domestick and for distant War  Ours or our Friends Insulters to chastize  Long may ye flourish thus the Prince replies  Strange Transport seiz'd me as I pass'd along  To meet so many Troops and all so young  As if your Army did of Twins consist  Yet amongst them my late Acquaintance miss'd  Ev'n all that to your Palace did resort  When first you entertain'd me at your Court  And cannot guess the Cause from whence cou'd spring  So vast a ChangeThen thus the sighing King  Illustrious Guest to my strange Tale attend  Of sad Beginning but a joyful End  The whole to a vast History wou'd swell  I shall but half and that confus'dly tell  That Race whom so deserv'dly you admir'd  Are all into their silent Tombs retir'd  They fell and falling how they shook my State  Thought may conceive but Words can ne'er relate  The Story of Ants chang'd to Men  By Mr STONESTREET  A dreadful Plague from angry  Juno  came  To scourge the Land that bore her Rival's Name  Before her fatal Anger was reveal'd  And teeming Malice lay as yet conceal'd  All Remedies we try all Med'cines use  Which Nature cou'd supply or Art produce  Th' unconquer'd Foe derides the vain Design  And Art and Nature foil'd declare the Cause Divine  At first we only felt th' oppressive Weight  Of gloomy Clouds then teeming with our Fate  And lab'ring to discharge unactive Heat  But e're four Moons alternate Changes knew  With deadly Blasts the fatal  Southwind  blew  Infected all the Air and poison'd as it flew  Our Fountains too a dire Infection yield  For Crowds of Vipers creep along the Field  And with polluted Gore and baneful Steams  Taint all the Lakes and venom all the Streams  The young Disease with milder Force began  And rag'd on Birds and Beasts excusing Man  The lab'ring Oxen fall before the Plow  Th' unhappy Plowmen stare and wonder how  The tabid Sheep with sickly Bleatings pines  Its Wooll decreasing as its Strength declines  The warlike Steed by inward Foes compell'd  Neglects his Honours and deserts the Field  Unnerv'd and languid seeks a base Retreat  And at the Manger groans but wish'd a nobler Fate  The Stags forget their Speed the Boars their Rage  Nor can the Bears the stronger Herds engage  A gen'ral Faintness does invade 'em all  And in the Woods and Fields promiscuously they fall  The Air receives the Stench and strange to say  The rav'nous Birds and Beasts avoid the Prey  Th' offensive Bodies rot upon the Ground  And spread the dire Contagion all around  But now the Plague grown to a larger Size  Riots on Man and scorns a meaner Prize  Intestine Heats begin the Civil War  And Flushings first the latent Flame declare  And Breath inspir'd which seem'd like fiery Air  Their black dry Tongues are swell'd and scarce can move  And short thick Sighs from panting Lungs are drove  They gape for Air with flatt'ring Hopes t'abate  Their raging Flames but that augments their Heat  No Bed no Cov'ring can the Wretches bear  But on the Ground expos'd to open Air  They lye and hope to find a pleasing Coolness there  The suff'ring Earth with that Oppression curst  Returns the Heat which they imparted first  In vain Physicians would bestow their Aid  Vain all their Art and useless all their Trade  And they ev'n they who fleeting Life recall  Feel the same Pow'rs and undistinguish'd fall  If any proves so daring to attend  His sick Companion or his darling Friend  Th' officious Wretch sucks in contagious Breath  And with his Friend does sympathize in Death  And now the Care and Hopes of Life are past  They please their Fancies and indulge their Taste  At Brooks and Streams regardless of their Shame  Each Sex promiscuous strives to quench their Flame  Nor do they strive in vain to quench it there  For Thirst and Life at once extinguish'd are  Thus in the Brooks the dying Bodies sink  But heedless still the rash Survivors drink  So much uneasy Down the Wretches hate  They fly their Beds to struggle with their Fate  But if decaying Strength forbids to rise  The Victim crawls and rouls till on the Ground he lies  Each shuns his Bed as each wou'd shun his Tomb  And thinks th' Infection only lodg'd at home  Here one with fainting steps does slowly creep  O'er Heaps of Dead and straight augments a Heap  Another while his Strength and Tongue prevail'd  Bewails his Friend and falls himself bewail'd  This with imploring Looks surveys the Skies  The last dear Office of his closing Eyes  But finds the Heav'ns implacable and dies  What now ah what employ'd my troubled Mind  But only Hopes my Subjects Fate to find  What Place soe'er my weeping Eyes survey  There in lamented Heaps the Vulgar lay  As Acorns scatter when the Winds prevail  Or mellow Fruit from shaken Branches fall  You see that Dome which rears its Front so high  'Tis sacred to the Monarch of the Sky  How many there with unregarded Tears  And fruitless Vows sent up successless Pray'rs  There Fathers for expiring Sons implor'd  And there the Wife bewail'd her gasping Lord  With pious Off'rings they'd appease the Skies  But they e're yet th' attoning Vapours rise  Before the Altars fall themselves a Sacrifice  They fall while yet their Hands the Gums contain  The Gums surviving but their Off'rers slain  The destin'd Ox with holy Garlands crown'd  Prevents the Blow and feels an unexpected Wound  When I my self invok'd the Pow'rs Divine  To drive the fatal Pest from Me and Mine  When now the Priest with Hands uplifted stood  Prepar'd to strike and shed the sacred Blood  The Gods themselves the mortal Stroke bestow  The Victim falls but They impart the Blow  Scarce was the Knife with the pale Purple stain'd  And no Presages cou'd be then obtain'd  From putrid Entrails where th' Infection reign'd  Death stalk'd around with such resistless Sway  The Temples of the Gods his Force obey  And Suppliants feel his Stroke while yet they pray  Go now said he your Deities implore  For fruitless Aid for I defie their Pow'r  Then with a curst malicious Joy survey'd  The very Altars stain'd with Trophies of the Dead  The rest grown mad and frantick with Despair  Urge their own Fate and so prevent the Fear  Strange Madness that when Death pursu'd so fast  T' anticipate the Blow with impious Haste  No decent Honour to their Urns are paid  Nor cou'd the Graves receive the num'rous Dead  For or they lay unbury'd on the Ground  Or unadorn'd a needy Fun'ral found  All Rev'rence past the fainting Wretches fight  For Fun'ral Piles which were another's Right  Unmourn'd they fall for who surviv'd to mourn  And Sires and Mothers unlamented burn  Parents and Sons sustain an equal Fate  And wand'ring Ghosts their kindred Shadows meet  The Dead a larger Space of Ground require  Nor are the Trees sufficient for the Fire  Despairing under Grief's oppressive Weight  And sunk by these tempestuous Blasts of Fate  O  Jove  said I if common Fame says true  If e'er  Aegina  gave those Joys to you  If e'er you lay enclos'd in her Embrace  Fond of her Charms and eager to possess  O Father if you do not yet disclaim  Paternal Care nor yet disown the Name  Grant my Petitions and with Speed restore  My Subjects num'rous as they were before  Or make me Partner of the Fate they bore  I spoke and glorious Lightning shone around  And ratling Thunder gave a prosp'rous Sound  So let it be and may these Omens prove  A Pledge said I of your returning Love  By chance a rev'rend Oak was near the Place  Sacred to  Jove  and of  Dodona  's Race  Where frugal Ants laid up their Winter Meat  Whose little Bodies bear a mighty Weight  We saw them march along and hide their Store  And much admir'd their Number and their Pow'r  Admir'd at first but after envy'd more  Full of Amazement thus to  Jove  I pray'd  O grant since thus my Subjects are decay'd  As many Subjects to supply the Dead  I pray'd and strange Convulsions mov'd the Oak  Which murmur'd tho' by ambient Winds unshook  My trembling Hands and stiff erected Hair  Exprest all Tokens of uncommon Fear  Yet both the Earth and sacred Oak I kist  And scarce cou'd hope yet still I hop'd the best  For Wretches whatsoe'er the Fates divine  Expound all Omens to their own Design  But now 'twas Night when ev'n Distraction wears  A pleasing Look and Dreams beguile our Cares  Lo The same Oak appears before my Eyes  Nor alter'd in its Shape nor former Size  As many Ants the num'rous Branches bear  The same their Labour and their frugal Care  The Branches too a like Commotion found  And shook th'industrious Creatures on the Ground  Who by degrees what's scarce to be believ'd  A nobler Form and larger Bulk receiv'd  And on the Earth walk'd an unusual Pace  With manly Strides and an erected Face  Their num'rous Legs and former Colour lost  The Insects cou'd a Human Figure boast  I wake and waking find my Cares again  And to the unperforming Gods complain  And call their Promise and Pretences vain  Yet in my Court I heard the murm'ring Voice  Of Strangers and a mixt uncommon Noise  But I suspected all was still a Dream  'Till  Telamon  to my Apartment came  Op'ning the Door with an impetuous Haste  O come said he and see your Faith and Hopes surpast  I follow and confus'd with Wonder view  Those Shapes which my presaging Slumbers drew  I saw and own'd and call'd them Subjects they  Confest my Pow'r submissive to my Sway  To  Jove  Restorer of my Race decay'd  My Vows were first with due Oblations paid  I then divide with an impartial Hand  My empty City and my ruin'd Land  To give the Newborn Youth an equal Share  And call them  Myrmidons  from what they were  You saw their Persons and they still retain  The Thrift of Ants tho' now transform'd to Men  A frugal People and inur'd to Sweat  Lab'ring to gain and keeping what they get  These equal both in Strength and Years shall join  Their willing Aid and follow your Design  With the first Southern Gale that shall present  To fill your Sails and favour your Intent  Continu'd by Mr TATE  With such Discourse they entertain the Day  The Ev'ning past in Banquets Sport and Play  Then having crown'd the Night with sweet Repose  Aurora  with the Wind at East arose  Now  Pallas  ' Sons to  Cephalus  resort  And  Cephalus  with  Pallas  ' Sons to Court  To the King's Levee him Sleep's silken Chain  And pleasing Dreams beyond his Hour detain  But then the Princes of the Blood in State  Expect and meet 'em at the Palace Gate  The Story of CEPHALUS and PROCRIS  To th'inmost Courts the  Grecian  Youths were led  And plac'd by  Phocus  on a  Tyrian  Bed  Who soon observing  Cephalus  to hold  A Dart of unknown Wood but arm'd with Gold  None better loves said he the Huntsman's Sport  Or does more often to the Woods resort  Yet I that Jav'lin's Stem with Wonder view  Too brown for Box too smooth a Grain for Yew  I cannot guess the Tree but never Art  Did form or Eyes behold so fair a Dart  The Guest then interrupts him'Twou'd produce  Still greater Wonder if you knew its Use  It never fails to strike the Game and then  Comes bloody back into your Hand again  Then  Ph  each Particular desires  And th' Author of the wond'rous Gift enquires  To which the Owner thus with weeping Eyes  And Sorrow for his Wife's sad Fate replies  This Weapon here O Prince can you believe  This Dart the Cause for which so much I grieve  And shall continue to grieve on 'till Fate  Afford such wretched Life no longer Date  Would I this fatal Gift had ne'er enjoy'd  This fatal Gift my tender Wife destroy'd  Procris  her Name ally'd in Charms and Blood  To fair  Orythia  courted by a God  Her Father seal'd my Hopes with Rites Divine  But firmer Love before had made her mine  Men call'd me blest and blest I was indeed  The second Month our Nuptials did succeed  When as upon  Hymettus  ' dewy Head  For Mountain Stags my Net betimes I spread  Aurora  spy'd and ravish'd me away  With Rev'rence to the Goddess I must say  Against my Will for  Procris  had my Heart  Nor wou'd her Image from my Thoughts depart  At last in Rage she cry'd Ingrateful Boy  Go to your  Procris  take your fatal Joy  And so dismiss'd me Musing as I went  What those Expressions of the Goddess meant  A thousand jealous Fears possess me now  Lest  Procris  had prophan'd her Nuptial Vow  Her Youth and Charms did to my Fancy paint  A lewd Adultress but her Life a Saint  Yet I was absent long the Goddess too  Taught me how far a Woman cou'd be true  Aurora  's Treatment much Suspicion bred  Besides who truly love ev'n Shadows dread  I strait impatient for the Tryal grew  What Courtship back'd with richest Gifts cou'd do  Aurora  's Envy aided my Design  And lent me Features far unlike to mine  In this Disguise to my own House I came  But all was chaste no conscious Sign of Blame  With thousand Arts I scarce Admittance found  And then beheld her weeping on the Ground  For her lost Husband hardly I retain'd  My Purpose scarce the wish'd Embrace refrain'd  How charming was her Grief Then  Phocus  guess  What killing Beauties waited on her Dress  Her constant Answer when my Suit I prest  Forbear my Lord's dear Image guards this Breast  Wheree'er he is whatever Cause detains  Whoe'er has his my Heart unmov'd remains  What greater Proofs of Truth than these cou'd be  Yet I persist and urge my Destiny  At length she found when my own Form return'd  Her jealous Lover there whose Loss she mourn'd  Enrag'd with my Suspicion swift as Wind  She fled at once from me and all Mankind  And so became her Purpose to retain  A Nymph and Huntress in  Diana  's Train  Forsaken thus I found my Flames encrease  I own'd my Folly and I su'd for Peace  It was a Fault but not of Guilt to move  Such Punishment a Fault of too much Love  Thus I retriev'd her to my longing Arms  And many happy Days possess'd her Charms  But with herself she kindly did confer  What Gifts the Goddess had bestow'd on her  The fleetest Greyhound with this lovely Dart  And I of both have Wonders to impart  Near  Thebes  a Savage Beast of Race unknown  Laid waste the Field and bore the Vineyards down  The Swains fled from him and with one Consent  Our  Grecian  Youth to chase the Monster went  More swift than Light'ning he the Toils surpast  And in his Course Spears Men and Trees o'ercast  We slipt our Dogs and last my  Lelaps  too  When none of all the mortal Race wou'd do  He long before was struggling from my Hands  And e're we cou'd unloose him broke his Bands  That Minute where he was we cou'd not find  And only saw the Dust he left behind  I climb'd a neighb'ring Hill to view the Chase  While in the Plain they held an equal Race  The Savage now seems caught and now by Force  To quit himself nor holds the same strait Course  But running counter from the Foe withdraws  And with short Turning cheats his gaping Jaws  Which he retrieves and still so closely prest  You'd fear at ev'ry Stretch he were possess'd  Yet for the Gripe his Fangs in vain prepare  The Game shoots from him and he chops the Air  To cast my Jav'lin then I took my Stand  But as the Thongs were fitting to my Hand  While to the Valley I o'erlook'd the Wood  Before my Eyes two Marble Statues stood  That as pursu'd appearing at full Stretch  This barking after and at point to catch  Some God their Course did with this Wonder grace  That neither might be conquer'd in the Chase  A sudden Silence here his Tongue supprest  He here stops short and fain wou'd wave the rest  The eager Prince then urg'd him to impart  The Fortune that attended on the Dart  First then said he past Joys let me relate  For Bliss was the Foundation of my Fate  No Language can those happy Hours express  Did from our Nuptials me and  Procris  bless  The kindest Pair What more cou'd Heav'n confer  For She was all to me and I to her  Had  Jove  made Love great  Jove  had been despis'd  And I my  Procris  more than  Venus  priz'd  Thus while no other Joy we did aspire  We grew at last one Soul and one Desire  Forth to the Woods I went at Break of Day  The constant Practice of my Youth for Prey  Nor yet for Servant Horse or Dog did call  I found this single Dart to serve for all  With Slaughter tir'd I sought the cooler Shade  And Winds that from the Mountains pierc'd the Glade  Come gentle Air so was I wont to say  Come gentle Air sweet  Aura  come away  This always was the Burden of my Song  Come 'swage my Flames sweet  Aura  come along  Thou always art most welcome to my Breast  I faint approach thou dearest kindest Guest  These Blandishments and more than these I said  By Fate to unsuspected Ruin led  Thou art my Joy for thy dear sake I love  Each desart Hill and solitary Grove  When faint with Labour I Refreshment need  For Cordials on thy fragrant Breath I feed  At last a wand'ring Swain in hearing came  And cheated with the Sound of  Aura  's Name  He thought I had some Assignation made  And to my  Procris  ' Ear the News convey'd  Great Love is soonest with Suspicion fir'd  She swoon'd and with the Tale almost expir'd  Ah wretched Heart she cry'd ah faithless Man  And then to curse th' imagin'd Nymph began  Yet oft she doubts oft hopes she is deceiv'd  And chides herself that ever she believ'd  Her Lord to such Injustice cou'd proceed  Till she herself were Witness of the Deed  Next Morn I to the Woods again repair  And weary with the Chase invoke the Air  Approach dear  Aura  and my Bosom chear  At which a mournful Sound did strike my Ear  Yet I proceeded 'till the Thicket by  With rustling Noise and Motion drew my Eye  I thought some Beast of Prey was shelter'd there  And to the Covert threw my certain Spear  From whence a tender Sigh my Soul did wound  Ah me it cry'd and did like  Procris  sound  Procris  was there too well the Voice I knew  And to the Place with headlong Horror flew  Where I beheld her gasping on the Ground  In vain attempting from the deadly Wound  To draw the Dart her Love's dear fatal Gift  My guilty Arms had scarce the Strength to lift  The beauteous Load my Silks and Hair I tore  If possible to stanch the pressing Gore  For Pity begg'd her keep her flitting Breath  And not to leave me guilty of her Death  While I intreat she fainted fast away  And these few Words had only Strength to say  By all the sacred Bonds of plighted Love  By all your Rev'rence to the Pow'rs above  By all that made me charming once appear  By all the Truth for which you held me dear  And last by Love the Cause through which I bleed  Let  Aura  never to my Bed succeed  I then perceiv'd the Error of our Fate  And told it her but found and told too late  I felt her lower to my Bosom fall  And while her Eyes had any Sight at all  On mine she fix'd them in her Pangs still prest  My Hand and sigh'd her Soul into my Breast  Yet being undeceiv'd resign'd her Breath  Methought more chearfully and smil'd in Death  With such Concern the weeping Heroe told  This Tale that none who heard him cou'd withhold  From melting into sympathizing Tears  Till  Aeacus  with his two Sons appears  Whom he commits with their newlevy'd Bands  To Fortune's and so brave a Gen'ral's Hands  The End of the Seventh Book  To Her Grace the Dutchess of Rutla  Du Guernier  OVID's

striking with a Pebble wou'd release  Th' enchanted Notes in Times of happy Peace  Now too from thence the curious Maid beheld  Rough Feats of Arms and Combats of the Field  And since the Siege was long had learnt the Name  Of ev'ry Chief his Character and Fame  Their Arms their Horse and Quiver she descry'd  Nor cou'd the Dress of War the Warrior hide  Europa  's Son she knew above the Rest  And more than well became a Virgin Breast  In vain the crested Morion veils his Face  She thinks it adds a more peculiar Grace  His ample Shield embost with burnish'd Gold  Still makes the Bearer lovelier to behold  When the tough Jav'lin with a Whirl he sends  His Strength and Skill the sighing Maid commends  Or when he strains to draw the circling Bow  And his fine Limbs a manly Posture show  Compar'd with  Phoebus  he performs so well  Let her be Judge and  Minos  shall excell  But when the Helm put off display'd to Sight  And set his Features in an open Light  When vaulting to his Seat his Steed he prest  Caparison'd in Gold and richly drest  Himself in Scarlet sumptuously array'd  New Passions rise and fire the frantick Maid  O happy Spear she cries that feels his Touch  Nay ev'n the Reins he holds are blest too much  Oh were it lawful she cou'd wing her Way  Thro' the stern hostile Troops without Dismay  Or throw her Body to the distant Ground  And in the  Cretans  happy Camp be found  Wou'd  Minos  but desire it she'd expose  Her native Country to her Country's Foes  Unbar the Gates the Town with Flames infest  Or any thing that  Minos  shou'd request  And as she sate and pleas'd her longing Sight  Viewing the King's Pavilion veil'd with White  Shou'd Joy or Grief she said possess my Breast  To see my Country by a War opprest  I'm in Suspense For tho' 'tis Grief to know  I love a Man that is declar'd my Foe  Yet in my own Despite I must approve  That lucky War which brought the Man I love  Yet were I tender'd as a Pledge of Peace  The Cruelties of War might quickly cease  Oh with what Joy I'd wear the Chains he gave  A patient Hostage and a willing Slave  Thou lovely Object if the Nymph that bare  Thy charming Person were but half so fair  Well might a God her Virgin Bloom desire  And with a Rape indulge his amorous Fire  Oh had I Wings to glide along the Air  To his dear Tent I'd fly and settle there  There tell my Quality confess my Flame  And grant him any Dowry that he'd name  All all I'd give only my native Land  My dearest Country shou'd excepted stand  For perish Love and all expected Joys  E're with so base a Thought my Soul complies  Yet oft the Vanquish'd some Advantage find  When conquer'd by a noble gen'rous Mind  Brave  Minos  justly has the War begun  Fir'd with Resentment for his murder'd Son  The righteous Gods a righteous Cause regard  And will with Victory his Arms reward  We must be conquer'd and the Captive's Fate  Will surely seize us tho' it seize us late  Why then shou'd Love be idle and neglect  What  Mars  by Arms and Perils will effect  Oh Prince I dye with anxious Fear opprest  Lest some rash Hand shou'd wound my Charmer's Breast  For if they saw no barb'rous Mind cou'd dare  Against that lovely Form to raise a Spear  But I'm resolv'd and fix'd in this Decree  My Father's Country shall my Dowry be  Thus I prevent the Loss of Life and Blood  And in Effect the Action must be good  Vain Resolution for at ev'ry Gate  The trusty Centinels successive wait  The Keys my Father keeps ah there's my Grief  'Tis he obstructs all Hopes of my Relief  Gods that this hated Light I'd never seen  Or all my Life without a Father been  But Gods we all may be for those that dare  Are Gods and Fortune's chiefest Favours share  The ruling Pow'rs a lazy Pray'r detest  The bold Adventurer succeeds the best  What other Maid inspir'd with such a Flame  But wou'd take Courage and abandon Shame  But wou'd tho' Ruin shou'd ensue remove  Whate'er oppos'd and clear the Way to Love  This shall another's feeble Passion dare  While I sit tame and languish in Despair  No for tho' Fire and Sword before me lay  Impatient Love thro' both shou'd force its Way  Yet I have no such Enemies to fear  My sole Obstruction is my Father's Hair  His Purple Lock my sanguine Hope destroys  And clouds the Prospect of my rising Joys  Whilst thus she spoke amid the thick'ning Air  Night supervenes the greatest Nurse of Care  And as the Goddess spreads her sable Wings  The Virgin's Fears decay and Courage springs  The Hour was come when Man's o'erlabour'd Breast  Surceas'd its Care by downy Sleep possest  All things now hush'd  Scylla  with silent Tread  Urg'd her Approach to  Nisus  ' Royal Bed  There of the fatal Lock accursed Theft  She her unwitting Father's Head bereft  In safe Possession of her impious Prey  Out at a Postern Gate she takes her Way  Embolden'd by the Merit of the Deed  She traverses the adverse Camp with Speed  Till  Minos  ' Tent she reach'd The righteous King  She thus bespoke who shiver'd at the thing  Behold th' Effect of Love's resistless Sway  I  Nisus  ' Royal Seed to thee betray  My Country and my Gods For this strange Task  Minos  no other Boon but Thee I ask  This Purple Lock a Pledge of Love receive  No worthless Present since in it I give  My Father's HeadMov'd at a Crime so new  And with Abhorrence fill'd back  Minos  drew  Nor touch'd th' unhallow'd Gift but thus exclaim'd  With Mein indignant and with Eyes inflam'd  Perdition seize thee thou thy Kind's Disgrace  May thy devoted Carcass find no Place  In Earth or Air or Sea by all outcast  Shall  Minos  with so foul a Monster blast  His  Cretan  World where cradled  Jove  was nurst  Forbid it Heav'naway thou most accurst  And now  Alcathoë  its Lord exchang'd  Was under  Minos  ' Domination rang'd  While the most equal King his Care applies  To curb the Conquer'd and new Laws devise  The Fleet by his Command with hoisted Sails  And ready Oars invites the murm'ring Gales  At length the  Cretan  Hero Anchor weigh'd  Repaying with Neglect th' abandon'd Maid  Deaf to her Cries he furrows up the Main  In vain she prays sollicits him in vain  And now she furious grows in wild Despair  She wrings her Hands and throws aloft her Hair  Where run'st thou thus she vents her deep Distress  Why shun'st thou her that crown'd thee with Success  Her whose fond Love to thee cou'd sacrifice  Her Country and her Parent sacred Ties  Can nor my Love nor proffer'd Presents find  A Passage to thy Heart and make thee kind  Can nothing move thy Pity O Ingrate  Can'st thou behold my lost forlorn Estate  And not be soften'd Can'st thou throw off One  Who has no Refuge left but Thee alone  Where shall I seek for Comfort whither fly  My native Country does in Ashes lye  Or were't not so my Treason bars me there  And bids me wander Shall I next repair  To a wrong'd Father by my Guilt undone  Me all Mankind deservedly will shun  I out of all the World my self have thrown  To purchase an Access to  Crete  alone  Which since refus'd ungen'rous Man give o'er  To boast thy Race  Europa  never bore  A thing so savage Thee some Tygress bred  On the bleak  Syrt  's inhospitable Bed  Or where  Charybdis  pours its rapid Tide  Tempestuous Thou art not to  Jove  ally'd  Nor did the King of Gods thy Mother meet  Beneath a Bull's forg'd Shape and bear to  Crete  That Fable of thy glorious Birth is feign'd  Some wild outrageous Bull thy Dam sustain'd  O Father  Nisus  now my Death behold  Exult O City by my Baseness sold  Minos  obdurate has aveng'd ye all  But 'twere more just by those I wrong'd to fall  For why shou'dst thou who only didst subdue  By my offending my Offence pursue  Well art thou matcht to one whose am'rous Flame  Too fiercely rag'd for Humankind to tame  One who within a wooden Heifer thrust  Courted a low'ring Bull's mistaken Lust  And from whose Monsterteeming Womb the Earth  Receiv'd what much it mourn'd a biform Birth  But what avail my Plaints the whistling Wind  Which bears him far away leaves them behind  Well weigh'd  Pasiphaë  when she prefer'd  A Bull to thee more brutish than the Herd  But ah Time presses and the labour'd Oars  To Distance drive the Fleet and lose the less'ning Shores  Think not ungrateful Man the liquid Way  And threat'ning Billows shall inforce my Stay  I'll follow thee in Spite My Arms I'll throw  Around thy Oars or grasp thy crooked Prow  And drag thro' drenching Seas Her eager Tongue  Had hardly clos'd the Speech when forth she sprung  And prov'd the Deep  Cupid  with added Force  Recruits each Nerve and aids her wat'ry Course  Soon she the Ship attains unwelcome Guest  And as with close Embrace its Sides she prest  A Hawk from upper Air came pouring down  'Twas  Nisus  cleft the Sky with Wings newgrown  At  Scylla  's Head his horny Bill he aims  She fearful of the Blow the Ship disclaims  Quitting her Hold And yet she fell not far  But wondring finds herself sustain'd in Air  Chang'd to a Lark she mottled Pinions shook  And from the ravish'd Lock the Name of  Ciris  took  The Labyrinth  Now  Minos  landed on the  Cretan  Shore  Performs his Vows to  Jove  's protecting Pow'r  A hundred Bullocks of the largest Breed  With Flowrets crown'd before his Altar bleed  While Trophies of the Vanquish'd brought from far  Adorn the Palace with the Spoils of War  Mean while the Monster of a HumanBeast  His Family's Reproach and Stain increas'd  His double Kind the Rumour swiftly spread  And evidenc'd the Mother's beastly Deed  When  Minos  willing to conceal the Shame  That sprung from the Reports of tattling Fame  Resolves a dark Inclosure to provide  And far from Sight the twoform'd Creature hide  Great  Daedalus  of  Athens  was the Man  That made the Draught and form'd the wondrous Plan  Where Rooms within themselves encircled lye  With various Windings to deceive the Eye  As soft  Maeander  's wanton Current plays  When thro' the  Phrygian  Fields it loosely strays  Backward and forward rouls the dimpl'd Tide  Seeming at once two different Ways to glide  While circling Streams their former Banks survey  And Waters past succeeding Waters see  Now floating to the Sea with downward Course  Now pointing upward to its ancient Source  Such was the Work so intricate the Place  That scarce the Workman all its Turns cou'd trace  And  Daedalus  was puzzled how to find  The secret Ways of what himself design'd  These private Walls the  Minotaure  include  Who twice was glutted with  Athenian  Blood  But the third Tribute more successful prov'd  Slew the foul Monster and the Plague remov'd  When  Theseus  aided by the Virgin's Art  Had trac'd the guiding Thread thro' ev'ry Part  He took the gentle Maid that set him free  And bound for  Dias  cut the briny Sea  There quickly cloy'd ungrateful and unkind  Left his fair Consort in the Isle behind  Whom  Bacchus  saw and straining in his Arms  Her rifl'd Bloom and violated Charms  Resolves for this the dear engaging Dame  Shou'd shine for ever in the Rolls of Fame  And bids her Crown among the Stars be plac'd  With an eternal Constellation grac'd  The golden Circlet mounts and as it flies  Its Diamonds twinkle in the distant Skies  There in their pristin Form the gemmy Rays  Between  Alcides  and the Dragon blaze  The Story of DAEDALUS and ICARUS  In tedious Exile now too long detain'd  Daedalus  languish'd for his native Land  The Sea foreclos'd his Flight yet thus he said  Tho' Earth and Water in Subjection laid  O cruel  Minos  thy Dominion be  We'll go thro' Air for sure the Air is free  Then to new Arts his cunning Thought applies  And to improve the Work of Nature tries  A Row of Quills in gradual Order plac'd  Rise by Degrees in Length from first to last  As on a Cliff th' ascending Thicket grows  Or different Reeds the rural Pipe compose  Along the Middle runs a Twine of Flax  The Bottom Stems are joyn'd by pliant Wax  Thus well compact a hollow Bending brings  The fine Composure into real Wings  His Boy young  Icarus  that near him stood  Unthinking of his Fate with Smiles pursu'd  The floating Feathers which the moving Air  Bore loosely from the Ground and wafted here and there  Or with the Wax impertinently play'd  And with his childish Tricks the great Design delay'd  The final Masterstroke at last impos'd  And now the neat Machine compleatly clos'd  Fitting his Pinions on a Flight he tries  And hung selfballanc'd in the beaten Skies  Then thus instructs his Child My Boy take Care  To wing your Course along the middle Air  If low the Surges wet your flagging Plumes  If high the Sun the melting Wax consumes  Steer between both Nor to the Northern Skies  Nor South  Orion  turn your giddy Eyes  But follow me Let me before you lay  Rules for the Flight and mark the pathless Way  Then teaching with a fond Concern his Son  He took the untry'd Wings and fix'd 'em on  But fix'd with trembling Hands and as he speaks  The Tears roul gently down his aged Cheeks  Then kiss'd and in his Arms embrac'd him fast  But knew not this Embrace must be the last  And mounting upward as he wings his Flight  Back on his Charge he turns his aking Sight  As Parent Birds when first their callow Care  Leave the high Nest to tempt the liquid Air  Then chears him on and oft with fatal Art  Reminds the Stripling to perform his Part  These as the Angler at the silent Brook  Or MountainShepherd leaning on his Crook  Or gaping Plowman from the Vale descries  They stare and view 'em with religious Eyes  And strait conclude 'em Gods since none but they  Thro' their own azure Skies cou'd find a Way  Now  Delos    Paros  on the Left are seen  And  Samos  favour'd by  Jove  's haughty Queen  Upon the Right the Isle  Lebynthos  nam'd  And fair  Calymnè  for its Honey fam'd  When now the Boy whose childish Thoughts aspire  To loftier Aims and make him ramble higher  Grown wild and wanton more embolden'd flies  Far from his Guide and soars among the Skies  The soft'ning Wax that felt a nearer Sun  Dissolv'd apace and soon began to run  The Youth in vain his melting Pinions shakes  His Feathers gone no longer Air he takes  Oh Father Father as he strove to cry  Down to the Sea he tumbled from on high  And found his Fate yet still subsists by Fame  Among those Waters that retain his Name  The Father now no more a Father cries  Ho  Icarus  where are you as he flies  Where shall I seek my Boy he cries again  And saw his Feathers scatter'd on the Main  Then curs'd his Art and fun'ral Rites confer'd  Naming the Country from the Youth interr'd  A Partridge from a neighb'ring Stump beheld  The Sire his monumental Marble build  Who with peculiar Call and flutt'ring Wing  Chirpt joyful and malicious seem'd to sing  The only Bird of all its Kind and late  Transform'd in Pity to a feather'd State  From whence O  Daedalus  thy Guilt we date  His Sister's Son when now twelve Years were past  Was with his Uncle as a Scholar plac'd  The unsuspecting Mother saw his Parts  And Genius fitted for the finest Arts  This soon appear'd for when the spiny Bone  In Fishes Backs was by the Stripling known  A rare Invention thence he learnt to draw  Fil'd Teeth in Iron and made the grating Saw  He was the first that from a Knob of Brass  Made two strait Arms with widening Stretch to pass  That while one stood upon the Center's Place  The other round it drew a circling Space  Daedalus  envy'd this and from the Top  Of fair  Minerva  's Temple let him drop  Feigning that as he lean'd upon the Tow'r  Careless he stoop'd too much and tumbled o'er  The Goddess who th' Ingenious still befriends  On this Occasion her Assistance lends  His Arms with Feathers as he fell she veils  And in the Air a newmade Bird he sails  The Quickness of his Genius once so fleet  Still in his Wings remains and in his Feet  Still tho' transform'd his ancient Name he keeps  And with low Flight the newshorn Stubble sweeps  Declines the lofty Trees and thinks it best  To brood in Hedgerows o'er it's humble Nest  And in Remembrance of the former Ill  Avoids the Heights and Precipices still  At length fatigu'd with long laborious Flights  On fair  Sicilia  's Plains the Artist lights  Where  Cocalus  the King that gave him Aid  Was for his Kindness with Esteem repaid  Athens  no more her doleful Tribute sent  That Hardship gallant  Theseus  did prevent  Their Temples hung with Garlands they adore  Each friendly God but most  Minerva  's Pow'r  To her to  Jove  to All their Altars smoak  They each with Victims and Perfumes invoke  Now talking Fame thro' every  Graecian  Town  Had spread immortal  Theseus  thy Renown  From him the neighb'ring Nations in Distress  In suppliant Terms implore a kind Redress  The Story of MELEAGER and ATALANTA  By Mr DRYDEN  From him the  Caledonians  sought Relief  Though valiant  Meleagrus  was their Chief  The Cause a Boar who ravag'd far and near  Of  Cynthia  's Wrath th' avenging Minister  For  Oeneus  with Autumnal Plenty bless'd  By Gifts to Heav'n his Gratitude express'd  Cull'd Sheafs to  Ceres  to  Lyaeus  Wine  To  Pan  and  Pales  offer'd Sheep and Kine  And Fat of Olives to  Minerva  's Shrine  Beginning from the Rural Gods his Hand  Was lib'ral to the Pow'rs of high Command  Each Deity in ev'ry Kind was bless'd  Till at  Diana  's Fane th' invidious Honour ceas'd  Wrath touches ev'n the Gods the Queen of Night  Fir'd with Disdain and jealous of her Right  Unhonour'd though I am at least said she  Not unreveng'd that impious Act shall be  Swift as the Word she sped the Boar away  With Charge on those devoted Fields to prey  No larger Bulls th'  Aegyptian  Pastures feed  And none so large  Sicilian  Meadows breed  His Eyeballs glare with Fire suffus'd with Blood  His Neck shoots up a thickset thorny Wood  His bristled Back a Trench impal'd appears  And stands erected like a Field of Spears  Froth fills his Chaps he sends a grunting Sound  And part he churns and part befoams the Ground  For Tusks with  Indian  Elephants he strove  And  Jove  's own Thunder from his Mouth he drove  He burns the Leaves the scorching Blast invades  The tender Corn and shrivels up the Blades  Or suff'ring not their yellow Beards to rear  He tramples down the Spikes and intercepts the Year  In vain the Barns expect their promis'd Load  Nor Barns at home nor Reeks are heap'd abroad  In vain the Hinds the ThreshingFloor prepare  And exercise their Flails in empty Air  With Olives evergreen the Ground is strow'd  And Grapes ungather'd shed their gen'rous Blood  Amid the Fold he rages nor the Sheep  Their Shepherds nor the Grooms their Bulls can keep  From Fields to Walls the frighted Rabble run  Nor think themselves secure within the Town  Till  Mcleagros  and his chosen Crew  Contemn the Danger and the Praise pursue  Fair  Leda  's Twins in time to Stars decreed  One fought on Foot one curb'd the fiery Steed  Then issu'd forth fam'd  Jason  after these  Who mann'd

Quiver on her Shoulder ty'd  One Hand a Dart and one a Bow supply'd  Such was her Face as in a Nymph display'd  A fair fierce Boy or in a Boy betray'd  The blushing Beauties of a modest Maid  The  Caledonian  Chief at once the Dame  Beheld at once his Heart receiv'd the Flame  With Heav'ns averse O happy Youth he cry'd  For whom thy Fates reserve so fair a Bride  He sigh'd and had no Leisure more to say  His Honour call'd his Eyes another way  And forc'd him to pursue the now neglected Prey  There stood a Forest on a Mountain's Brow  Which overlook'd the shaded Plains below  No sounding Ax presum'd those Trees to bite  Coeval with the World a venerable Sight  The Heroes there arriv'd some spread around  The Toils some search the Footsteps on the Ground  Some from the Chains the faithful Dogs unbound  Of Action eager and intent in Thought  The Chiefs their honourable Danger sought  A Valley stood below the common Drain  Of Waters from above and falling Rain  The Bottom was a moist and marshy Ground  Whose Edges were with bending Oziers crown'd  The knotty Bulrush next in order stood  And all within of Reeds a trembling Wood  From hence the Boar was rous'd and sprung amain  Like Lightning sudden on the WarriorTrain  Beats down the Trees before him shakes the Ground  The Forest echoes to the crackling Sound  Shout the fierce Youth and Clamours ring around  All stood with their protended Spears prepar'd  With broad Steel Heads the brandish'd Weapons glar'd  The Beast impetuous with his Tusks aside  Deals glancing Wounds the fearful Dogs divide  All spend their Mouth aloof but none abide  Echion  threw the first but miss'd his Mark  And stuck his Boarspear on a Maple's Bark  Then  Jason  and his Javelin seem'd to take  But fail'd with Overforce and whiz'd above

gath'ring up his Feet look'd down with Fear  And thought his monstrous Foe was still too near  Against a Stump his Tusk the Monster grinds  And in the sharpen'd Edge new Vigour finds  Then trusting to his Arms young  Othrys  sound  And ranch'd his Hips with one continu'd Wound  Now  Leda  's Twins the future Stars appear  White were their Habits white their Horses were  Conspicuous both and both in Act to throw  Their trembling Lances brandish'd at the Foe  Nor had they miss'd but he to Thickets fled  Conceal'd from aiming Spears not pervious to the Steed  But  Telamon  rush'd in and happ'd to meet  A rising Root that held his fastned Feet  So down he fell whom sprawling on the Ground  His Brother from the wooden Gyves unbound  Mean time the VirginHuntress was not slow  T' expel the Shaft from her contracted Bow  Beneath his Ear the fastned Arrow stood  And from the Wound appear'd the trickling Blood  She blush'd for Joy But  Meleagros  rais'd  His Voice with loud Applause and the fair Archer prais'd  He was the first to see and first to show  His Friends the Marks of the successful Blow  Nor shall thy Valour want the Praises due  He said a virtuous Envy seiz'd the Crew  They shout the Shouting animates their Hearts  And all at once employ their thronging Darts  But out of Order thrown in Air they joyn  And Multitude makes frustrate the Design  With both his Hands the proud  Ancaeus  takes  And flourishes his doublebiting Ax  Then forward to his Fate he took a Stride  Before the rest and to his Fellows cry'd  Give place and mark the Diff'rence if you can  Between a Woman Warrior and a Man  The Boar is doom'd nor though  Diana  lend  Her Aid  Diana  can her Beast defend  Thus boasted he then stretch'd on Tiptoe stood  Secure to make his empty Promise good  But the more wary Beast prevents the Blow  And upward rips the Groin of his audacious Foe  Ancaeus  falls his Bowels from the Wound  Rush out and clotter'd Blood distains the Ground  Perithous  no small Portion of the War  Press'd on and shook his Lance To whom from far  Thus  Theseus  cry'd O stay my better Part  My more than Mistress of my Heart the Heart  The Strong may fight aloof  Ancaeus  try'd  His Force too near and by presuming dy'd  He said and while he spake his Javelin threw  Hissing in Air th' unerring Weapon flew  But on an Arm of Oak that stood betwixt  The Marksman and the Mark his Lance he fixt  Once more bold  Jason  threw but fail'd to wound  The Boar and slew an undeserving Hound  And through the Dog the Dart was nail'd to Ground  Two Spears from  Meleager  's Hand were sent  With equal Force but various in th' Event  The first was fix'd in Earth the second stood  On the Boar's bristled Back and deeply drank his Blood  Now while the tortur'd Savage turns around  And flings about his Foam impatient of the Wound  The Wound's great Author close at Hand provokes  His Rage and plies him with redoubled Strokes  Wheels as he wheels and with his pointed Dart  Explores the nearest Passage to his Heart  Quick and more quick he spins in giddy Gires  Then falls and in much Foam his Soul expires  This Act with Shouts Heav'nhigh the friendly Band  Applaud and strain in theirs the Victor's Hand  Then all approach the Slain with vast Surprize  Admire on what a Breadth of Earth he lies  And scarce secure reach out their Spears afar  And blood their Points to prove their Partnership of War  But he the conqu'ring Chief his Foot impress'd  On the strong Neck of that destructive Beast  And gazing on the Nymph with ardent Eyes  Accept said he fair  Nonacrine  my Prize  And though inferior suffer me to join  My Labours and my Part of Praise with thine  At this presents her with the Tusky Head  And Chine with rising Bristles roughly spread  Glad she receiv'd the Gift and seem'd to take  With double Pleasure for the Giver's sake  The rest were seiz'd with sullen Discontent  And a deaf Murmur through the Squadron went  All envy'd but the  Theslyan  Brethren show'd  The least Respect and thus they vent their Spleen aloud  Lay down those honour'd Spoils nor think to share  Weak Woman as thou art the Prize of War  Ours is the Title thine a foreign Claim  Since  Meleagros  from our Lineage came  Trust not thy Beauty but restore the Prize  Which he besotted on that Face and Eyes  Would rend from us At this enflam'd with Spite  From her they snatch the Gift from him the Giver's Right  But soon th' impatient Prince his Fauchion drew  And cry'd Ye Robbers of another's Due  Now learn the Diff'rence at your proper Cost  Betwixt true Valour and an empty Boast  At this advanc'd and sudden as the Word  In proud  Plexippus  ' Bosom plung'd the Sword  Toxeus  amaz'd and with Amazement slow  Or to revenge or ward the coming Blow  Stood doubting and while doubting thus he stood  Receiv'd the Steel bath'd in his Brother's Blood  Pleas'd with the first unknown the second News  Althaea  to the Temples pays their Dues  For her Son's Conquest when at length appear  Her grisly Brethren stretch'd upon the Bier  Pale at the sudden Sight she chang'd her Cheer  And with her Cheer her Robes but hearing tell  The Cause the Manner and by whom they fell  'Twas Grief no more or Grief and Rage were one  Within her Soul at last 'twas Rage alone  Which burning upwards in Succession dries  The Tears that stood consid'ring in her Eyes  There lay a Log unlighted on the Hearth  When she was lab'ring in the Throws of Birth  For th' unborn Chief the fatal Sisters came  And rais'd it up and toss'd it on the Flame  Then on the Rock a scanty Measure place  Of vital Flax and turn'd the Wheel apace  And turning sung To this red Brand and thee  O newborn Babe we give an equal Destiny  So vanish'd out of View The frighted Dame  Sprung hasty from her Bed and quench'd the Flame  The Log in secret lock'd she kept with Care  And that while thus preserv'd preserv'd her Heir  This Brand she now produc'd and first she strows  The Hearth with Heaps of Chips and after blows  Thrice heav'd her Hand and heav'd she thrice repress'd  The Sister and the Mother long contest  Two doubtful Titles in one tender Breast  And now her Eyes and Cheeks with Fury glow  Now pale her Cheeks her Eyes with Pity flow  Now low'ring Looks presage approaching Storms  And now prevailing Love her Face reforms  Resolv'd she doubts again the Tears she dry'd  With burning Rage are by new Tears supply'd  And as a Ship which Winds and Waves assail  Now with the Current drives now with the Gale  Both opposite and neither long prevail  She feels a double Force by Turns obeys  Th' imperious Tempest and th'impetuous Seas  So fares  Althaea  's Mind she first relents  With Pity of that Pity then repents  Sister and Mother long the Scales divide  But the Beam nodded on the Sister's Side  Sometimes she softly sigh'd then roar'd aloud  But Sighs were stifled in the Cries of Blood  The pious impious Wretch at length decreed  To please her Brothers Ghost her Son should bleed  And when the fun'ral Flames began to rise  Receive she said a Sister's Sacrifice  A Mother's Bowels burn High in her Hand  Thus while she spoke she held the fatal Brand  Then thrice before the kindled Pile she bow'd  And the three Furies thrice invok'd aloud  Come come revenging Sisters come and view  A Sister paying her dead Brothers Due  A Crime I punish and a Crime commit  But Blood for Blood and Death for Death is fit  Great Crimes must be with greater Crimes repaid  And second Funerals on the former laid  Let the whole Houshold in one Ruin fall  And may  Diana  's Curse o'ertake us all  Shall Fate to happy  Oeneus  still allow  One Son while  Thestius  stands depriv'd of two  Better Three lost than One unpunish'd go  Take then dear Ghosts while yet admitted new  In Hell you wait my Duty take your Due  A costly Off'ring on your Tomb is laid  When with my Blood the Price of yours is paid  Ah whither am I hurry'd Ah forgive  Ye Shades and let your Sister's Issue live  A Mother cannot give him Death tho' he  Deserves it he deserves it not from me  Then shall th'unpunish'd Wretch insult the Slain  Triumphant live nor only live but reign  While you thin Shades the Sport of Winds are tost  O'er dreary Plains or tread the burning Coast  I cannot cannot bear 'tis past 'tis done  Perish this impious this detested Son  Perish his Sire and perish I withall  And let the House's Heir and the hop'd Kingdom fall  Where is the Mother fled her pious Love  And where the Pains with which ten Months I strove  Ah had'st thou dy'd my Son in Infant Years  Thy little Herse had been bedew'd with Tears  Thou liv'st by me to me thy Breath resign  Mine is the Merit the Demerit thine  Thy Life by double Title I require  Once giv'n at Birth and once preserv'd from Fire  One Murder pay or add one Murder more  And me to them who fell by thee restore  I would but cannot My Son's Image stands  Before my Sight and now their angry Hands  My Brothers hold and Vengeance these exact  This pleads Compassion and repents the Fact  He pleads in vain and I pronounce his Doom  My Brothers though unjustly shall o'ercome  But having paid their injur'd Ghosts their Due  My Son requires my Death and mine shall his pursue  At this for the last time she lifts her Hand  Averts her Eyes and half unwilling drops the Brand  The Brand amid the flaming Fewel thrown  Or drew or seem'd to draw a dying Groan  The Fires themselves but faintly lick'd their Pr  Then loath'd their impious Food and would have shrunk away  Just then the Heroe cast a doleful Cry  And in those absent Flames began to fry  The blind Contagion rag'd within his Veins  But he with manly Patience bore his Pains  He fear'd not Fate but only griev'd to die  Without an honest Wound and by a Death so dry  Happy  Ancaeus  thrice aloud he cry'd  With what becoming Fate in Arms he dy'd  Then call'd his Brothers Sisters Sire around  And her to whom his Nuptial Vows were bound  Perhaps his Mother a long Sigh he drew  And his Voice failing took his last Adieu  For as the Flames augment and as they stay  At their full Height then languish to decay  They rise and sink by Fits at last they soar  In one bright Blaze and then descend no more  Just so his inward Heats at height impair  Till the last burning Breath shoots out the Soul in Air  Now lofty  Calidon  in Ruins lies  All Ages all Degrees unsluice their Eyes  And Heav'n and Earth resound with Murmurs Groans and Cries  Matrons and Maidens beat their Breasts and tear  Their Habits and root up their scatter'd Hair  The wretched Father Father now no more  With Sorrow sunk lies prostrate on the Floor  Deforms his hoary Locks with Dust obscene  And curses Age and loaths a Life prolong'd with Pain  By Steel her stubborn Soul his Mother freed  And punish'd on her self her impious Deed  Had I a hundred Tongues a Wit so large  As could their hundred Offices discharge  Had  Phoebus  all his  Helicon  bestow'd  In all the Streams inspiring all the God  Those Tongues that Wit those Streams that God in vain  Would offer to describe his Sister's Pain  They beat their Breasts with many a bruizing Blow  Till they turn livid and corrupt the Snow  The Corps they cherish while the Corps remains  And exercise and rub with fruitless Pains  And when to fun'ral Flames 'tis born away  They kiss the Bed on which the Body lay  And when those fun'ral Flames no longer burn  The Dust compos'd within a pious Urn  Ev'n in that Urn their Brother they confess  And hug it in their Arms and to their Bosoms press  His Tomb is rais'd then stretch'd along the Ground  Those living Monuments his Tomb surround  Ev'n to his Name inscrib'd their Tears they pay  Till Tears and Kisses wear his Name away  But  Cynthia  now had all her Fury spent  Not with less Ruin than a Race content  Excepting  Gorgè  perish'd all the Seed  And  Dejanira  her whom Heav'n for  Hercules  decreed  Satiate at last no longer she pursu'd  The weeping

 And with his Finger pointed at the Place  Is it one parted Isle which stands alone  How nam'd and yet methinks it seems not one  To whom the watry God made this Reply  'Tis not one Isle but five distinct they lye  'Tis Distance which deceives the cheated Eye  But that  Diana  's Act may seem less strange  These once proud  Naiads  were before their Change  T was on a Day more solemn than the

Who laugh'd at all the Gods believ'd in none  He shook his impious Head and thus replies  These Legends are no more than pious Lies  You attribute too much to Heav'nly Sway  To think they give us Forms and take away  The rest of better Minds their Sense declar'd  Against this Doctrine and with Horror heard  Then  Lelex  rose an old experienc'd Man  And thus with sober Gravity began  Heav'n's Pow'r is infinite Earth Air and Sea  The Manufacture Mass the making Pow'r obey  By Proof to clear your Doubt In  Phrygian  Ground  Two neighb'ring Trees with Walls encompass'd round  Stand on a mod'rate Rise with Wonder shown  One a hard Oak a softer Linden one  I saw the Place and them by  Pittheus  sent  To  Phrygian  Realms my Grandsire's Government  Not far from thence is seen a Lake the Haunt  Of Coots and of the fishing Cormorant  Here  Jove  with  Hermes  came but in Disguise  Of mortal Men conceal'd their Deities  One laid aside his Thunder one his Rod  And many toilsome Steps together trod  For Harbour at a thousand Doors they knock'd  Not one of all the thousand but was lock'd  At last an hospitable House they found  A homely Shed the Roof not far from Ground  Was thatch'd with Reeds and Straw together bound  There  Baucis  and  Philemon  liv'd and there  Had liv'd long marry'd and a happy Pair  Now old in Love though little was their Store  Inur'd to Want their Poverty they bore  Nor aim'd at Wealth professing to be poor  For Master or for Servant here to call  Was all alike where only Two were All  Command was none where equal Love was paid  Or rather both commanded both obey'd  From lofty Roofs the Gods repuls'd before  Now stooping enter'd through the little Door  The Man their hearty Welcome first express'd  A common Settle drew for either Guest  Inviting each his weary Limbs to rest  But ere they sate officious  Baucis  lays  Two Cushions stuff'd with Straw the Seat to raise  Course but the best she had then rakes the Load  Of Ashes from the Hearth and spreads abroad  The living Coals and lest they shou'd expire  With Leaves and Bark she feeds her Infant Fire  It smoaks and then with trembling Breath she blows  Till in a chearful Blaze the Flames arose  With Brushwood and with Chips she strengthens these  And adds at last the Boughs of rotten Trees  The Fire thus form'd she sets the Kettle on  Like burnish'd Gold the little Seether shone  Next took the Coleworts which her Husband got  From his own Ground a small wellwater'd Spot  She stripp'd the Stalks of all their Leaves the best  She cull'd and them with handy Care she dress'd  High o'er the Hearth a Chine of Bacon hung  Good old  Philemon  seiz'd it with a Prong  And from the sooty Rafter drew it down  Then cut a Slice but scarce enough for one  Yet a large Portion of a little Store  Which for their sakes alone he wish'd were more  This in the Pot he plung'd without Delay  To tame the Flesh and drain the Salt away  The Time between before the Fire they sat  And shorten'd the Delay by pleasing Chat  A Beam there was on which a Beechen Pail  Hung by the Handle on a driven Nail  This fill'd with Water gently warm'd they set  Before their Guests in this they bath'd their Feet  And after with clean Towels dry'd their Sweat  This done the Host produc'd the genial Bed  Sallow the Feet the Borders and the Sted  Which with no costly Coverlet they spread  But course old Garments yet such Robes as these  They laid alone at Feasts on Holydays  The good old Houswife tucking up her Gown  The Table sets th'invited Gods lie down  The TrivetTable of a Foot was lame  A Blot which prudent  Baucis  overcame  Who thrusts beneath the limping Leg a Sherd  So was the mended Board exactly rear'd  Then rubb'd it o'er with newlygather'd Mint  A wholesom Herb that breath'd a grateful Scent  Pallas  began the Feast where first was seen  The partycolour'd Olive Black and Green  Autumnal Cornels next in order serv'd  In Lees of Wine well pickled and preserv'd  A GardenSallad was the third Supply  Of Endive Radishes and Succory  Then Curds and Cream the Flow'r of Country Fare  And newlaid Eggs which  Baucis  ' busie Care  Turn'd by a gentle Fire and roasted rare  All these in Earthen Ware were serv'd to Board  And next in place an Earthen Pitcher stor'd  With Liquor of the best the Cottage cou'd afford  This was the Table's Ornament and Pride  With Figures wrought Like Pages at his Side  Stood Beechen Bowls and these were shining clean  Varnish'd with Wax without and lin'd within  By this the boiling Kettle had prepar'd  And to the Table sent the smoaking Lard  On which with eager Appetite they dine  A sav'ry Bit that serv'd to rellish Wine  The Wine itself was suiting to the rest  Still working in the Must and lately press'd  The second Course succeeds like that before  Plums Apples Nuts and of their wintry Store  Dry Figs and Grapes and wrinkled Dates were set  In Canisters t'enlarge the little Treat  All these a Milkwhite Honeycomb surround  Which in the Midst the CountryBanquet crown'd  But the kind Hosts their Entertainment grace  With hearty Welcome and an open Face  In all they did you might discern with Ease  A willing Mind and a Desire to please  Mean time the Beechen Bowls went round and still  Though often empty'd were observ'd to fill  Fill'd without Hands and of their own Accord  Ran without Feet and danc'd about the Board  Devotion seiz'd the Pair to see the Feast  With Wine and of no common Grape increas'd  And up they held their Hands and fell to Pray'r  Excusing as they cou'd their Country Fare  One Goose they had 'twas all they cou'd allow  A wakeful Centry and on Duty now  Whom to the Gods for Sacrifice they vow  Her with malicious Zeal the Couple view'd  She ran for Life and limping they pursu'd  Full well the Fowl perceiv'd their bad Intent  And wou'd not make her Master's Compliment  But persecuted to the Pow'rs she flies  And close between the Legs of  Jove  she lies  He with a gracious Ear the Suppliant heard  And sav'd her Life then what he was declar'd  And own'd the God The Neighbourhood said he  Shall justly perish for Impiety  You stand alone exempted but obey  With Speed and follow where we lead the Way  Leave these accurs'd and to the Mountain's Height  Ascend nor once look backward in your Flight  They haste and what their tardy Feet deny'd  The trusty Staff their better Leg supply'd  An Arrow's Flight they wanted to the Top  And there secure but spent with Travel stop  Then turn their now no more forbidden Eyes  Lost in a Lake the floated Level lies  A watry Desart covers all the Plains  Their Cot alone as in an Isle remains  Wondring with weeping Eyes while they deplore  Their Neighbours Fate and Country now no more  Their little Shed scarce large enough for Two  Seems from the Ground increas'd in Height and Bulk to grow  A stately Temple shoots within the Skies  The Crotches of their Cot in Columns rise  The Pavement polish'd Marble they behold  The Gates with Sculpture grac'd the Spires and Tiles of Gold  Then thus the Sire of Gods with Looks serene  Speak thy Desire thou only Just of Men  And thou O Woman only worthy found  To be with such a Man in Marriage bound  Awhile they whisper then to  Jove  address'd  Philemon  thus prefers their joint Request  We crave to serve before your sacred Shrine  And offer at your Altars Rites Divine  And since not any Action of our Life  Has been polluted with Domestick Strife  We beg one Hour of Death that neither she  With Widow's Tears may live to bury me  Nor weeping I with wither'd Arms may bear  My breathless  Baucis  to the Sepulcher  The Godheads sign their Suit They run their Race  In the same Tenour all th'appointed Space  Then when their Hour was come while they relate  These past Adventures at the Temple Gate  Old  Baucis  is by old  Philemon  seen  Sprouting with sudden Leaves of spritely Green  Old  Baucis  look'd where old  Philemon  stood  And saw his lengthen'd Arms a sprouting Wood  New Roots their fasten'd Feet begin to bind  Their Bodies stiffen in a rising Rind  Then ere the Bark above their Shoulders grew  They give and take at once their last Adieu  At once Farewel O faithful Spouse they said  At once th' incroaching Rinds their closing Lips invade  Ev'n yet an ancient  Tyanaean  shows  A spreading Oak that near a Linden grows  The Neighbourhood confirm the Prodigy  Grave Men not vain of Tongue or like to lie  I saw my self the Garlands on their Boughs  And Tablets hung for Gifts of granted Vows  And off'ring fresher up with pious Pray'r  The Good said I are God's peculiar Care  And such as honour Heav'n shall heav'nly Honour share  Continu'd by Mr VERNON  The Changes of PROTEUS  He ceas'd in his Relation to proceed  Whilst all admir'd the Author and the Deed  But  Theseus  most inquisitive to know  From Gods what wondrous Alterations grow  Whom thus the  Calydonian  Stream address'd  Rais'd high to speak the Couch his Elbow press'd  Some when transform'd fix in the lasting Change  Some with more Right thro' various Figures range  Proteus  thus large thy Privilege was found  Thou Inmate of the Seas which Earth surround  Sometimes a blooming Youth you grac'd the Shore  Oft a fierce Lion or a furious Boar  With glist'ring Spires now seem'd an hissing Snake  The Bold would tremble in his Hands to take  With Horns assum'd a Bull

Honours to their Shrines deny'd  As Fame reports his Hand an Ax sustain'd  Which  Ceres  ' consecrated Grove prophan'd  Which durst the venerable Gloom invade  And violate with Light the awful Shade  An ancient Oak in the dark Center stood  The Covert's Glory and itself a Wood  Garlands embrac'd its Shaft and from the Boughs  Hung Tablets Monuments of prosp'rous Vows  In the cool Dusk its unpierc'd Verdure spread  The  Dryads  oft their hallow'd Dances led  And oft when round their gaging Arms they cast  Full fifteen Ells it measur'd in the Waste  Its Height all under Standards did surpass  As they aspir'd above the humbler Grass  These Motives which would gentler Minds restrain  Could not make  Triope  's bold Son abstain  He sternly charg'd his Slaves with strict Decree  To fell with gashing Steel the sacred Tree  But whilst they lingring his Commands delay'd  He snatch'd an Ax and thus blaspheming said  Was this no Oak nor  Ceres  ' fav'rite Care  But  Ceres  ' self this Arm unaw'd shou'd dare  Its leafy Honours in the Dust to spread  And level with the Earth its airy Head  He spoke and as he poiz'd a slanting Stroak  Sighs heav'd and Tremblings shook the frighted Oak  Its Leaves look'd sickly pale its Acorns grew  And its long Branches sweat a chilly Dew  But when his impious Hand a Wound bestow'd  Blood from the mangled Bark in Currents flow'd  When a devoted Bull of mighty Size  A sinning Nation's grand Atonement dies  With such a Plenty from the spouting Veins  A crimson Stream the turfy Altar stains  The Wonder all amaz'd yet one more bold  The Fact disswading strove his Ax to hold  But the  Thessalian  obstinately bent  Too proud to change too harden'd to repent  On his kind Monitor his Eyes which burn'd  With Rage and with his Eyes his Weapon turn'd  Take the Reward says he of pious Dread  Then with a Blow lop'd off his parted Head  No longer check'd the Wretch his Crime pursu'd  Doubled his Strokes and Sacrilege renew'd  When from the groaning Trunk a Voice was heard  A  Dryad  I by  Ceres  ' Love prefer'd  Within the Circle of this clasping Rind  Coeval grew and now in Ruin joyn'd  But instant Vengeance shall thy Sin pursue  And Death is chear'd with this prophetick View  At last the Oak with Cords enforc'd to bow  Strain'd from the Top and sap'd with Wounds below  The humbler Wood Partaker of its Fate  Crush'd with its

of their Woe  The beauteous Goddess with a graceful Air  Bow'd in Consent and nodded to their Pray'r  The awful Motion shook the fruitful Ground  And wav'd the Fields with golden Harvests crown'd  Soon she contriv'd in her projecting Mind  A Plague severe and piteous in its Kind  If Plagues for Crimes of such presumptuous Height  Could Pity in the softest Breast create  With pinching Want and Hunger's keenest Smart  To tear his Vitals and corrode his Heart  But since her near Approach by Fate's deny'd  To Famine and broad Climes their Pow'rs divide  A Nymph the Mountain's Ranger she address'd  And thus resolv'd her high Commands express'd  The Description of FAMINE  Where frozen  Scythia  's utmost Bound is plac'd  A Desart lies a melancholy Waste  In yellow Crops there Nature never smil'd  No fruitful Tree to shade the barren Wild  There sluggish Cold its icy Station makes  There Paleness Frights and aguish Trembling shakes  Of pining Famine this the fated Seat  To whom my Orders in these Words repeat  Bid her this Miscreant with her sharpest Pains  Chastise and sheath herself into his Veins  Be unsubdu'd by Plenty's baffled Store  Reject my Empire and defeat my Pow'r  And lest the Distance and the tedious Way  Should with the Toil and long Fatigue dismay  Ascend my Chariot and convey'd on high  Guide the rein'd Dragons thro' the parting Sky  The Nymph accepting of the granted Carr  Sprung to the Seat and posted thro' the Air  Nor stop'd till she to a bleak Mountain came  Of wondrous Height and  Caucasus  its Name  There in a stony Field the Fiend she found  Herbs gnawing and Roots scratching from the Ground  Her Elfelock Hair in matted Tresses grew  Sunk were her Eyes and pale her ghastly Hue  Wan were her Lips and foul with clammy Glew  Her Throat was furr'd her Guts appear'd within  With snaky Crawlings thro' her Parchment Skin  Her jutting Hips seem'd starting from their Place  And for a Belly was a Belly's Space  Her Dugs hung dangling from her craggy Spine  Loose to her Breast and fasten'd to her Chine  Her Joints protuberant by Leanness grown  Consumption sunk the Flesh and rais'd the Bone  Her Knees large Orbits bunch'd to monstrous Size  And Ancles to undue Proportion rise  This Plague the Nymph not daring to draw near  At Distance hail'd and greeted from afar  And tho' she told her Charge without Delay  Tho' her Arrival late and short her Stay  She felt keen Famine or she seem'd to feel  Invade her Blood and on her Vitals steal  She turn'd from the Infection to remove  And back to  Thessaly  the Serpents drove  The Fiend obey'd the Goddess's Command  Tho' their Effects in Opposition stand  She cut her Way supported by the Wind  And reach'd the Mansion by the Nymph assign'd  'Twas Night when entring  Erisichthon  's Room  Dissolv'd in Sleep and thoughtless of his Doom  She clasp'd his Limbs by impious Labour tir'd  With battish Wings but her whole self inspir'd  Breath'd on his Throat and Chest a tainting Blast  And in his Veins infus'd an endless Fast  The Task dispatch'd away the Fury flies  From plenteous Regions and from rip'ning Skies  To her old barren North she wings her Speed  And Cottages distress'd with pinching Need  Still Slumbers  Erisichthon  's Senses drown  And sooth his Fancy with their softest Down  He dreams of Viands delicate to eat  And revels on imaginary Meat  Chaws with his working Mouth but chaws in vain  And tires his grinding Teeth with fruitless Pain  Deludes his Throat with visionary Fare  Feasts on the Wind and banquets on the Air  The Morning came the Night and Slumbers past  But still the furious Pangs of Hunger last  The cank'rous Rage still gnaws with griping Pains  Stings in his Throat and in his Bowels reigns  Strait he requires impatient in Demand  Provisions from the Air the Seas the Land  But tho' the Land Air Seas Provisions grant  Starves at full Tables and complains of Want  What to a People might in Dole be paid  Or victual Cities for a long Blockade  Could not one Wolfish Appetite asswage  For glutting Nourishment increas'd its Rage  As Rivers pour'd from ev'ry distant Shore  The Sea insatiate drinks and thirsts for more  Or as the Fire which all Materials burns  And wasted Forests into Ashes turns  Grows more voracious as the more it preys  Recruits dilate the Flame and spread the Blaze  So impious  Erisichthon  's Hunger raves  Receives Refreshments and Refreshments craves  Food raises a Desire for Food and Meat  Is but a new Provocative to eat  He grows more empty as the more supply'd  And endless Cramming but extends the Void  The Transformations of ERISICHTHON's Daughter  Now Riches hoarded by Paternal Care  Were sunk the Glutton swallowing up the Heir  Yet the devouring Flame no Stores abate  Nor less his Hunger grew with his Estate  One Daughter left as left his keen Desire  A Daughter worthy of a better Sire  Her too he sold spent Nature to sustain  She scorn'd a Lord with generous Disdain  And flying spread her Hands upon the Main  Then pray'd Grant Thou I Bondage may escape  And with my Liberty reward thy Rape  Repay my Virgin Treasure with thy Aid  'Twas  Neptune  who deflowr'd the beauteous Maid  The God was

whose Baits hide treach'rous Wire  Whose Art can manage and experienc'd Skill  The taper Angle and the bobbing Quill  So may the Sea be ruffled with no Storm  But smooth with Calms as you the Truth inform  So your Deceit may no shy Fishes feel  Till struck and fasten'd on the bearded Steel  Did not you standing view upon the Strand  A wandring Maid I'm sure I saw her stand  Her Hair disorder'd and her homely Dress  Betray'd her Want and witness'd her Distress  Me heedless she reply'd whoe'er you are  Excuse attentive to another Care  I settled on the Deep my steady Eye  Fix'd on my Float and bent on my Employ  And that you may not doubt what I impart  So may the Ocean's God assist my Art  If on the Beach since I my Sport pursu'd  Or Man or Woman but my self I view'd  Back o'er the

foreign Stories why shou'd I relate  I too my self can to new Forms translate  Tho' the Variety's not unconfin'd  But fix'd in Number and restrain'd in Kind  For often I this present Shape retain  Oft

melancholy Story trace  So great a Conqu'ror softens the Disgrace  Nor was it still so mean the Prize to yield  As great and glorious to dispute the Field  Perhaps you've heard of  Dëianira  's Name  For all the Country spoke her Beauty's Fame  Long was the Nymph by num'rous Suiters woo'd  Each with Address his envy'd Hopes pursu'd  I joyn'd the loving Band to gain the Fair  Reveal'd my Passion to

Plain  My Arms stretch forth my pliant Limbs prepare  And with bent Hands expect the furious War  O'er my sleek Skin now gather'd Dust he throws  And yellow Sand his mighty Muscles strows  Oft he my Neck and nimble Legs assails  He seems to grasp me but as often fails  Each Part he now invades with eager Hand  Safe in my Bulk immoveable I stand  So when loud Storms break high and foam and roar  Against some Mole that stretches from the Shore  The firm Foundation lasting Tempests braves  Defies the warring Winds and driving Waves  Awhile we breathe then forward rush amain  Renew the Combat and our Ground maintain  Foot strove with Foot I prone extend my Breast  Hands war with Hands and Forehead Forehead prest  Thus have I seen two furious Bulls engage  Inflam'd with equal Love and equal Rage  Each claims the fairest Heifer of the Grove  And Conquest only can decide their Love  The trembling Herds survey the Fight from far  Till Victory decides th'important War  Three times in vain he strove my Joints to wrest  To force my Hold and throw me from his Breast  The fourth he broke my Gripe that clasp'd him round  Then with new Force he stretch'd me on the Ground  Close to my Back the mighty Burthen clung  As if a Mountain o'er my Limbs were flung  Believe my Tale nor do I boastful aim  By feign'd Narration to extol my Fame  No sooner from his Grasp I Freedom get  Unlock my Arms that flow'd with trickling Sweat  But quick he seiz'd me and renew'd the Strife  As my exhausted Bosom pants for Life  My Neck he gripes my Knee to Earth he strains  I fall and bite the Sand with Shame and Pains  O'ermatch'd in Strength to Wiles and Arts I take  And slip his Hold in Form of speckled Snake  Who when I wreath'd in Spires my Body round  Or show'd my forky Tongue with hissing Sound  Smiles at my Threats Such Foes my Cradle knew  He cries dire Snakes my Infant Hand o'erthrew  A Dragon's Form might other Conquests gain  To war with me you take that Shape in vain  Art thou proportion'd to the  Hydra  's Length  Who by his Wounds receiv'd augmented Strength  He rais'd a hundred hissing Heads in Air  When one I lopt upsprung a dreadful Pair  By his Wounds fertile and with Slaughter strong  Singly I quell'd him and stretch'd dead along  What canst thou do a Form precarious prone  To rouse my Rage with Terrors not thy own  He said and round my Neck his Hands he cast  And with his straining Fingers wrung me fast  My Throat he tortur'd close as Pincers clasp  In vain I strove to loose the forceful Grasp  Thus vanquish'd too a third Form still remains  Chang'd to a Bull my Lowing fills the Plains  Strait on the Left his nervous Arms were thrown  Upon my brindled Neck and tugg'd it down  Then deep he struck my Horn into the Sand  And fell'd my Bulk along the dusty Land  Nor yet his Fury cool'd 'twixt Rage and Scorn  From my maim'd Front he tore the stubborn Horn  This heap'd with Flow'rs and Fruits the  Naiads  bear  Sacred to Plenty and the bounteous Year  He spoke when lo a beauteous Nymph appears  Girt like  Diana  's Train with flowing Hairs  The Horn she brings in which all Autumn's stor'd  And ruddy Apples for the second Board  Now Morn begins to dawn the Sun's bright Fire  Gilds the high Mountains and the Youths retire  Nor stay'd they till the troubled Stream subsides  And in its Bounds with peaceful Current glides  But  Acheloüs  in his oozy Bed  Deep hides his Brow deform'd and rustick Head  No real Wound the Victor's Triumph show'd  But his lost Honours griev'd the watry God  Yet ev'n that Loss the Willow's Leaves o'erspread  And verdant Reeds in Garlands bind his Head  The Death of NESSUS the Centaur  This Virgin too thy Love O  Nessus  found  To her alone you owe the fatal Wound  As the strong Son of  Jove  his Bride conveys  Where his Paternal Lands their Bulwarks raise  Where from her slopy Urn  Evenus  pours  Her rapid Current swell'd by wintry Show'rs  He came The frequent Eddies whirl'd the Tide  And the deep rolling Waves all Pass deny'd  As for himself he stood unmov'd by Fears  For now his Bridal Charge employ'd his Cares  The stronglimb'd  Nessus  thus officious cry'd  For he the Shallows of the Stream had try'd  Swim thou  Alcides  all thy Strength prepare  On yonder Bank I'll lodge thy Nuptial Care  Th'  Aonian  Chief to  Nessus  trusts his Wife  All pale and trembling for her Heroe's Life  Cloath'd as he stood in the fierce Lion's Hide  The laden Quiver o'er his Shoulder ty'd  For cross the Stream his Bow and Club were cast  Swift he plung'd in These Billows shall be past  He said nor sought where smoother Waters glide  But stem'd the rapid Dangers of the Tide  The Bank he reach'd again the Bow he bears  When hark his Bride's known Voice alarms his Ears  Nessus  to thee I call aloud he cries  Vain is thy Trust in Flight be timely wise  Thou Monster doubleshap'd my Right set free  If thou no Rev'rence owe my Fame and me  Yet Kindred shou'd thy lawless Lust deny  Think not perfidious Wretch from me to fly  Tho' wing'd with Horse's Speed Wounds shall pursue  Swift as his Words the fatal Arrow flew  The Centaur's Back admits the feather'd Wood  And thro' his Breast the barbed Weapon stood  Which when in Anguish thro' the Flesh he tore  From both the Wounds gush'd forth the spumy Gore  Mix'd with  Lernaean  Venom this he took  Nor dire Revenge his dying Breast forsook  His Garment in the reeking Purple dy'd  To rouse Love's Passion he presents the Bride  The Death of HERCULES  Now a long Interval of Time succeeds  When the great Son of  Jove  's immortal Deeds  And Stepdame's Hate had fill'd Earth's utmost Round  He from  O Echalia  with new Lawrels crown'd  In Triumph was return'd He Rites prepares  And to the King of Gods directs his Pray'rs  When Fame who Falshood cloaths in Truth's Disguise  And swells her little Bulk with growing Lies  Thy tender Ear O  Deianira  mov'd  That  Hercules  the fair  Iole  lov'd  Her Love believes the Tale the Truth she fears  Of his new Passion and gives way to Tears  The flowing Tears diffus'd her wretched Grief  Why seek I thus from streaming Eyes Relief  She cries indulge not thus these fruitless Cares  The Harlot will but triumph in thy Tears  Let something be resolv'd while yet there's Time  My Bed not conscious of a Rival's Crime  In Silence shall I mourn or loud complain  Shall I seek  Calydon  or here remain  What tho' ally'd to  Meleager  's Fame  I boast the Honours of a Sister's Name  My Wrongs perhaps now urge me to pursue  Some desp'rate Deed by which the World shall view  How far Revenge and Woman's Rage can rise  When weltring in her Blood the Harlot dies  Thus various Passions rul'd by turns her Breast  She now resolves to send the fatal Vest  Dy'd with  Lernaean  Gore whose Pow'r might move  His Soul anew and rouse declining Love  Nor knew she what her sudden Rage bestows  When she to  Lychas  trusts her future Woes  With soft Endearments she the Boy commands  To bear the Garment to her Husband's Hands  Th' unwitting Heroe takes the Gift in haste  And o'er his Shoulders  Lerna  's Poyson cast  As first the Fire with Frankincense he strows  And utters to the Gods his holy Vows  And on the Marble Altar's polish'd Frame  Pours forth the grapy Stream the rising Flame  Sudden dissolves the subtle pois'nous Juice  Which taints his Blood and all his Nerves bedews  With wonted Fortitude he bore the Smart  And not a Groan confess'd his burning Heart▪  At length his Patience was subdu'd by Pain  He rends the sacred Altar from the Plain  OEte  's wide Forests eccho with his Cries  Now to rip off the deathful Robe he tries  Wheree'er he plucks the Vest the Skin he tears  The mangled Muscles and huge Bones he bares  A ghastful Sight or raging with his Pain  To rend the sticking Plague he tugs in vain  As the red Iron hisses in the Flood  So boils the Venom in his curdling Blood  Now with the greedy Flame his Entrails glow  And livid Sweats down all his Body flow  The cracking Nerves burnt up are burst in twain  The lurking Venom melts his swimming Brain  Then lifting both his Hands aloft he cries  Glut thy Revenge dread Empress of the Skies  Sate with my Death the Rancour of thy Heart  Look down with Pleasure and enjoy my Smart  Or if e'er Pity mov'd an hostile Breast  For here I stand thy Enemy profest  Take hence this hateful Life with Tortures torn  Inur'd to Trouble and to Labours born  Death is the Gift most welcome to my Woe  And such a Gift a Stepdame may bestow  Was it for this  Busiris  was subdu'd  Whose barb'rous Temples reek'd with Stranger's Blood  Press'd in these Arms his Fate  Antaeus  found  Nor gain'd recruited Vigour from the Ground  Did I not tripleform'd  Geryon  fell  Or did I fear the triple Dog of Hell  Did not these Hands the Bull's arm'd Forehead hold  Are not our mighty Toils in  Elis  told  Do not  Stymphalian  Lakes proclaim thy Fame  And fair  Parthenian  Woods resound thy Name  Who seiz'd the golden Belt of  Thermodon    And who the Dragonguarded Apples won  Could the fierce Centaur's Strength my Force withstand  Or the fell Boar that spoil'd th'  Arcadian  Land  Did not these Arms the  Hydra  's Rage subdue  Who from his Wounds to double Fury grew  What if the  Thracian  Horses fat with Gore  Who human Bodies in their Mangers tore  I saw and with their barb'rous Lord o'erthrew  What if these Hands  Nemaea  's Lion slew  Did not this Neck the heav'nly Globe sustain  The female Partner of the Thund'rer's Reign  Fatigu'd at length suspends her harsh Commands  Yet no Fatigue hath slack'd these valiant Hands  But now new Plagues pursue me neither Force  Nor Arms nor Darts can stop their raging Course  Devouring Flame thro' my rack'd Entrails strays  And on my Lungs and shrivell'd Muscles preys  Yet still  Eurystheus  breathes the vital Air  What Mortal now shall seek the Gods with Pray'r  The Transformation of LYCHAS into a Rock  The Hero said and with the Torture stung  Furious o'er  OEte  's lofty Hills he sprung  Stuck with the Shaft thus scours the Tyger round  And seeks the flying Author of his Wound  Now might you see him trembling now he vents  His anguish'd Soul in Groans and loud Laments  He strives to tear the clinging Vest in vain  And with uprooted Forests strows the Plain  Now kindling into Rage his Hands he rears  And to his kindred Gods directs his Pray'rs  When  Lychas  lo he spies who trembling flew  And in a hollow Rock conceal'd from View  Had shun'd his Wrath Now Grief renew'd his Pain  His Madness chaff'd and thus he raves again  Lychas  to thee alone my Fate I owe  Who bore the Gift the Cause of all my Woe  The Youth all pale with shiv'ring Fear was stung  And vain Excuses faulter'd on his Tongue  Alcides  snatch'd him as with suppliant Face  He strove to clasp his Knees and beg for Grace  He toss'd him o'er his Head with airy Course  And hurl'd with more than with an Engine's Force  Far o'er th'  Eubaean  Main aloof he flies  And hardens by Degrees amid the Skies  So show'ry Drops when chilly Tempests blow  Thicken at first then whiten into Snow  In Balls congeal'd the rolling Fleeces bound  In solid Hail result upon the Ground  Thus whirl'd with nervous Force thro' distant Air  The Purple Tide forsook his Veins with Fear  All Moisture left his Limbs Transform'd to Stone  In ancient Days the craggy Flint was known  Still in th'  Eubaean  Waves his Front he rears  Still the small Rock in human Form appears  And still the Name of hapless  Lychas  bears  The Apotheosis of HERCULES  But now the Hero of immortal Birth  Fells  OEte  's Forests on the groaning Earth  A Pile he builds to  Philoctetes  ' Care  He leaves his deathful Instruments of War  To him commits those Arrows which again  Shall see the Bulwarks of the  Trojan  Reign  The Son of  Paean  lights the lofty Pyre  High round the Structure climbs the greedy Fire  Plac'd on the Top thy nervous Shoulders spread  With the  Nemaean  Spoils thy careless Head  Rais'd on the knotty Club with Look Divine  Here thou dread Hero of Celestial Line  Wert stretch'd at Ease as when a chearful Guest  Wine crown'd thy Bowls and Flow'rs thy Temples drest  Now on all Sides the potent Flames aspire  And crackle round those Limbs that mock the Fire  A sudden Terror seiz'd th'immortal Host  Who thought the World's profess'd Defender lost  This when the Thund'rer saw with Smiles he cries  'Tis from your Fears ye Gods my Pleasures rise  Joy swells my Breast that my allruling Hand  O'er such a grateful People boasts Command  That you my suff'ring Progeny wou'd aid  Tho' to his Deeds this just Respect be paid  Me you've oblig'd Be all your Fears forborn  Th'  OEtean  Fires do thou great Hero scorn  Who vanquish'd all things shall subdue the Flame  That Part alone of gross maternal Frame  Fire shall devour while what from me he drew  Shall live immortal and its Force subdue  That when he's dead I'll raise to Realms above  May all the Pow'rs the righteous Act approve  If any God dissent and judge too great  The sacred Honours of the heav'nly Seat  Ev'n he shall own his Deeds deserve the Sky  Ev'n he reluctant shall at length comply  Th'assembled Pow'rs

Womb the teeming Birth confess'd  To whom  Alcmena  thus her Speech address'd  O may the Gods protect thee in that Hour  When midst thy Throws thou call'st th'  Ilithyian  Pow'r  May no Delays prolong thy racking Pain  As when I su'd for  Juno  's Aid in vain  When now  Alcides  ' mighty Birth drew nigh  And the tenth Sign roll'd forward on the Sky  My Womb extends with such a mighty Load  As  Jove  the Parent of the Burthen show'd  I could no more th' encreasing Smart sustain  My Horror kindles to recount the Pain  Cold chills my Limbs while I the Tale pursue  And now methinks I feel my Pangs anew  Seven Days and Nights amidst incessant Throws  Fatigu'd with Ills I lay nor knew Repose  When lifting high my Hands in Shrieks I pray'd  Implor'd the Gods and call'd  Lucina  's Aid  She came but prejudic'd to give my Fate  A Sacrifice to vengeful  Juno  's Hate  She hears the groaning Anguish of my Fits  And on the Altar at my Door she sits  O'er her left Knee her crossing Leg she cast  Then knits her Fingers close and wrings them fast  This stay'd the Birth in mutt'ring Verse she pray'd  The mutt'ring Verse th' unfinish'd Birth delay'd  Now with fierce Struggles raging with my Pain  At  Jove  's Ingratitude I rave in vain  How did I wish for Death such Groans I sent  As might have made the flinty Heart relent  Now the  Cadmeian  Matrons round me press  Offer their Vows and seek to bring Redress  Among the  Theban  Dames  Galanthis  stands  Strong limb'd red hair'd and just to my Commands  She first perceiv'd that all these racking Woes  From the persisting Hate of  Juno  rose  As here and there she pass'd by chance she sees  The scated Goddess on her closepress'd Knees  Her fastknit Hands she leans with chearful Voice  Galanthis  cries Whoe'er thou art rejoice  Congratulate the Dame she lies at Rest  At length the Gods  Alcmena  's Womb have blest  Swift from her Seat the startled Goddess springs  No more conceal'd her Hands abroad she flings  The Charm

from the Ground to rear  Chang'd to Forefeet her shrinking Arms appear  Her hairy Back her former Hue retains  The Form alone is lost her Strength remains  Who since the Lye did from her Mouth proceed  Shall from her pregnant Mouth bring forth her Breed  Nor shall she quit her long frequented Home  But haunt those Houses where she lov'd to roam  The Fable of DRYOPE  By Mr POPE  She said and for her lost  Galanthis  sighs  When the fair Consort of her Son replies  Since you a Servant's ravish'd Form bemoan  And kindly sigh for Sorrows not your own  Let me if Tears and Grief permit relate  A nearer Woe a Sister's stranger Fate  No Nymph of all  Oechalia  could compare  For beauteous Form with  Dryopè  the Fair  Her tender Mother's only Hope and Pride  My self the Offspring of a second Bride  This Nymph compress'd by him who rules the Day  Whom  Delphi  and the  Delian  Isle obey  Andraemon  lov'd and blest in all those Charms  That pleas'd a God succeeded to her Arms  A Lake there was with shelving Banks around  Whose verdant Summit fragrant Myrtles crown'd  Those Shades unknowing of the Fates she sought  And to the  Naiads  flow'ry Garlands brought  Her smiling Babe a pleasing Charge she prest  Between her Arms and nourish'd at her Breast  Not distant far a watry Lotos grows  The Spring was new and all the verdant Boughs  Adorn'd with Blossoms promis'd Fruits that vye  In glowing Colours with the  Tyrian  Dye  Of these she cropt to please her Infant Son  And I my self the same rash Act had done  But lo I saw as near her Side I stood  The violated Blossoms drop with Blood  Upon the Tree I cast a frightful Look  The trembling Tree with sudden Horror shook  Lotis  the Nymph if rural Tales be true  As from  Priapus  ' lawless Lust she flew  Forsook her Form and fixing here became  A flow'ry Plant which still preserves her Name  This Change unknown astonish'd at the Sight  My trembling Sister strove to urge her Flight  Yet first the Pardon of the  Nymphs  implor'd  And those offended  Sylvan  Pow'rs ador'd  But when she backward would have fled she found  Her stiff'ning Feet were rooted to the Ground  In vain to free her fasten'd Feet she strove  And as she struggles only moves above  She feels th' incroaching Bark around her grow  By slow Degrees and cover all below  Surpris'd at this her trembling Hand she heaves  To rend her Hair her Hand is fill'd with Leaves  Where late was Hair the shooting Leaves are seen  To rise and shade her with a sudden Green  The Child  Amphisus  to her Bosom prest  Perceiv'd a colder and a harder Breast  And found the Springs that ne'er 'till then deny'd  Their milky Moisture on a sudden dry'd  I saw unhappy what I now relate  And stood the helpless Witness of thy Fate  Embrac'd thy Boughs the rising Bark delay'd  There wish'd to grow and mingle Shade with Shade  Behold  Andraemon  and th' unhappy Sire  Appear and for their  Dryopè  enquire  A springing Tree for  Dryopè  they find  And print warm Kisses on the panting Rind  Prostrate with Tears their Kindred Plant bedew  And close embrac'd as to the Roots they grew  The Face was all that now remain'd of thee  No more a Woman nor yet quite a Tree  Thy Branches hung with humid Pearls appear  From ev'ry Leaf distills a trickling Tear  And strait a Voice while yet a Voice remains  Thus thro' the trembling Boughs in Sighs complains  If to the Wretched any Faith be giv'n  I swear by all th' unpitying Pow'rs of Heav'n  No wilful Crime this heavy Vengeance bred  In mutual Innocence our Lives we led  If this be false let these new Greens decay  Let sounding Axes lop my Limbs away  And crackling Flames on all my Honours prey  Now from my branching Arms this Infant bear  Let some kind Nurse supply a Mother's Care  Yet to his Mother let him oft be led  Sport in her Shades and in her Shades be fed  Teach him when first his Infant Voice shall frame  Imperfect Words and lisp his Mother's Name  To hail this Tree and say with weeping Eyes  Within this Plant my hapless Parent lies  And when in Youth he seeks the shady Woods  Oh let him fly the chrystal Lakes and Floods  Nor touch the fatal Flow'rs but warn'd by me  Believe a Goddess shrin'd in ev'ry Tree  My Sire my Sister and my Spouse farewel  If in your Breasts or Love or Pity dwell  Protect your Plant nor let my Branches feel  The browzing Cattle or the piercing Steel  Farewel and since I cannot bend to join  My Lips to yours advance at least to mine  My Son thy Mother's parting Kiss receive  While yet thy Mother has a Kiss to give  I can no more the creeping Rind invades  My closing Lips and hides my Head in Shades  Remove your Hands the Bark shall soon suffice  Without their Aid to seal these dying Eyes  She ceas'd at once to speak and ceas'd to be  And all

 On  Asiatick  Shores a Town you frame  Which still is honour'd with the Founder's Name  Here you  Cyanëe  knew the beauteous Maid  As on her  Maeander  Father's winding Banks she stray'd  Caunus  and  Byblis  hence their Lineage trace  The double Offspring of your warm Embrace  The Passion of BYBLIS  By STEPHEN HARVEY  Esq  Let the sad Fate of wretched  Byblis  prove  A dismal Warning to unlawful Love  One Birth gave Being to the hapless Pair  But more was  Caunus  than a Sister's Care  Unknown she lov'd for yet the gentle Fire  Rose not in Flames nor kindled to Desire  'Twas thought no Sin to wonder at his Charms  Hang on his Neck and languish in his Arms  Thus wing'd with Joy fled the soft Hours away  And all the fatal Guilt on harmless Nature lay  But Love too soon from Piety declin'd  Insensibly deprav'd her yielding Mind  Dress'd she appears with nicest Art adorn'd  And ev'ry Youth but her lov'd Brother scorn'd  For him alone she labour'd to be fair  And curst all Charms that might with hers compare  'Twas she and only she must  Caunus  please  Sick at her Heart yet knew not her Disease  She call'd him Lord for Brother was a Name  Too cold and dull for her aspiring Flame  And when he spoke if Sister he reply'd  For  Byblis  change that frozen Word she cry'd  Yet waking still she watch'd her strugling Breast  And Love's Approaches were in vain address'd  Till gentle Sleep an easy Conquest made  And in her soft Embrace the Conqueror was laid  But oh too soon the pleasing Vision fled  And left her blushing on the conscious Bed  Ah me she cry'd how monstrous do I seem  Why these wild Thoughts and this incestuous Dream  Envy herself 'tis true must own his Charms  But what is Beauty in a Sister's Arms  Oh were I not that despicable she  How bless'd how pleas'd how happy shou'd I be  But unregarded now must bear my Pain  And but in Dreams my Wishes can obtain  O Seaborn Goddess with thy wanton Boy  Was ever such a charming Scene of Joy  Such perfect Bliss such ravishing Delight  Ne'er hid before in the kind Shades of Night  How pleas'd my Heart in what sweet Raptures tost  Ev'n Life itself in the soft Combat lost  While breathless he on my heav'd Bosom lay  And snatch'd the Treasures of my Soul away  If the bare Fancy so affects my Mind  How shou'd I rave if to the Substance join'd  Oh gentle  Caunus  quit thy hated Line  Or let thy Parents be no longer mine  Oh that in common all things were enjoy'd  But those alone who have our Hopes destroy'd  Were I a Princess thou an humble Swain  The proudest Kings shou'd rival thee in vain  It cannot be alas the dreadful Ill  Is fix'd by Fate and he's my Brother still  Hear me ye Gods I must have Friends in Heav'n  For  Jove  himself was to a Sister giv'n  But what are their Prerogatives above  To the short Liberties of humane Love  Fantastick Thoughts down down forbidden Fires  Or instant Death extinguish my Desires  Strict Virtue then with thy malicious Leave  Without a Crime I may a Kiss receive  But say shou'd I in spight of Laws comply  Yet cruel  Caunus  might himself deny  No Pity take of an afflicted Maid  For Love's sweet Game must be by Couples play'd  Yet why shou'd Youth and Charms like mine despair  Such Fears ne'er startled the  Aeolian  Pair  No Ties of Blood could their full Hopes destroy  They broke thro' all for the prevailing Joy  And who can tell but  Caunus  too may be  Rack'd and tormented in his Breast for me  Like me to the extreamest Anguish drove  Like me just waking from a Dream of Love  But stay Oh whither wou'd my Fury run  What Arguments I urge to be undone  Away fond  Byblis  quench these guilty Flames  Caunus  thy Love but as a Brother claims  Yet had he first been touch'd with Love of me  The charming Youth cou'd I despairing see  Oppress'd with Grief and dying by Disdain  Ah no too sure I shou'd have eas'd his Pain  Since then if  Caunus  ask'd me it were done  Asking my self what Dangers can I run  But canst thou ask and see that Right betray'd  From  Pyrrha  down to thy whole Sex convey'd  That selfdenying Gift we all enjoy  Of wishing to be won yet seeming to be coy  Well then for once let a fond Mistress woe  The Force of Love no Custom can subdue  This frantick Passion he by Words shall know  Soft as the melting Heart from whence they flow  The Pencil then in her fair Hand she held  By Fear discourag'd but by Love compell'd  She writes then blots writes on and blots again  Likes it as fit then razes it as vain  Shame and Assurance in her Face appear  And a faint Hope just yielding to Despair  Sister was wrote and blotted as a Word  Which she and  Caunus  too she hop'd abhorr'd  But now resolv'd to be no more controul'd  By scrup'lous Virtue thus her Grief she told  Thy Lover gentle  Caunus  wishes thee  That Health which thou alone canst give to me  O charming Youth the Gift I ask bestow  E're thou the Name of the fond Writer know  To thee without a Name I would be known  Since knowing that my Frailty I must own  Yet why shou'd I my wretched Name conceal  When thousand Instances my Flames reveal▪  Wan Looks and weeping Eyes have spoke my Pain  And Sighs discharg'd from my heav'd Heart in vain  Had I not wish'd my Passion might be seen  What cou'd such Fondness and Embraces mean  Such Kisses too Oh heedless lovely Boy  Without a Crime no Sister cou'd enjoy  Yet tho' extreamest Rage has rack'd my Soul  And raging Fires in my parch'd Bosom roul  Be Witness Gods how piously I strove  To rid my Thoughts of this enchanting Love  But who cou'd scape so fierce and sure a Dart  Aim'd at a tender and defenceless Heart  Alas what Maid cou'd suffer I have born  E're the dire Secret from my Breast was torn  To thee a helpless vanquish'd Wretch I come  'Tis you alone can save or give my Doom  My Life or Death this Moment you may chuse  Yet think Oh think no hated Stranger sues  No Foe but one alas too near ally'd  And wishing still much nearer to be ty'd  The Forms of Decency let Age debate  And Virtue's Rules by their cold Morals state  Their ebbing Joys give Leisure to enquire  And blame those noble Flights our Youth inspire  Where Nature kindly summons let us go  Our sprightly Years no Bounds in Love shou'd know  Shou'd feel no Check of Guilt and fear no Ill  Lovers and Gods act all things at their Will  We gain one Blessing from our hated Kin  Since our Paternal Freedom hides the Sin  Uncensur'd in each others Arms we lye  Think then how easy to compleat our Joy  Oh pardon and oblige a blushing Maid  Whose Rage the Pride of her vain Sex betray'd  Nor let my Tomb thus mournfully complain  Here  Byblis  lies by her lov'd  Caunus  slain  Forc'd here to end she with a falling Tear  Temper'd the pliant Wax which did the Signet bear  The curious Cypher was impress'd by Art  But Love had stamp'd one deeper in her Heart  Her Page a Youth of Confidence and Skill  Secret as Night stood waiting on her Will  Sighing she cry'd bear this thou faithful Boy  To my sweet Part'ner in eternal Joy  Here a long Pause her secret Guilt confess'd  And when at length she wou'd have spoke the rest  Half the dear Name lay bury'd in her Breast  Thus as he listned to her vain Command  Down fell the Letter from her trembling Hand  The Omen shock'd her Soul Yet go she cry'd  Can a Request from  Byblis  be deny'd  To the  Maeandrian  Youth's this Message born  The halfread Lines by his fierce Rage were torn  Hence hence he cry'd thou Pandar to her Lust  Bear hence the Triumph of thy impious Trust  Thy instant Death will but divulge her Shame  Or thy Life's Blood shou'd quench the guilty Flame  Frighted from threatning  Caunus  he withdrew  And with the dreadful News to his lost Mistress flew  The sad Repulse so struck the wounded Fair  Her Sense was buried in her wild Despair  Pale was her Visage as the ghastly Dead  And her scar'd Soul from the sweet Mansion fled  Yet with her Life renew'd her Love returns  And faintly thus her cruel Fate she mourns  'Tis just ye Gods was my false Reason blind  To write a Secret of this tender kind  With female Craft I shou'd at first have strove  By dubious Hints to sound his distant Love  And try'd those useful tho' dissembled Arts  Which Women practise on disdainful Hearts  I shou'd have watch'd whence the black Storm might rise  E're I had trusted the unfaithful Skies  Now on the rouling Billows I am tost  And with extended Sails on the blind Shelves am lost  Did not indulgent Heav'n my Doom foretell  When from my Hand the fatal Letter fell  What Madness seiz'd my Soul and urg'd me on  To take the only Course to be undone  I cou'd my self have told the moving Tale  With such alluring Grace as must prevail  Then had his Eyes beheld my blushing Fears  My rising Sighs and my descending Tears  Round his dear Neck these Arms I then had spread  And if rejected at his Feet been dead  If singly these had not his Thoughts inclin'd  Yet all united wou'd have shock'd his Mind  Perhaps my careless Page might be in fault  And in a luckless Hour the fatal Message brought  Business and worldly Thoughts might fill his Breast  Sometimes ev'n Love itself may be an irksome Guest  He cou'd not else have treated me with Scorn  For  Caunus  was not of a Tygress born  Nor Steel nor Adamant has fenc'd his Heart  Like mine 'tis naked to the burning Dart  Away false Fears he must he shall be mine  In Death alone I will my Claim resign  'Tis vain to wish my written Crime unknown  And for my Guilt much vainer to attone  Repuls'd and baffled fiercer still she burns  And  Caunus  with Disdain her impious Love returns  He saw no End of her injurious Flame  And fled his Country to avoid the Shame  Forsaken  Byblis  who had Hopes no more  Burst out in Rage and her loose Robes she tore  With her fair Hands she smote her tender Breast  And to the wondring World her Love confess'd  O'er Hills and Dales o'er Rocks and Streams she flew  But still in vain did her wild Lust pursue  Wearied at length on the cold Earth she fell  And now in Tears alone cou'd her sad Story tell  Relenting Gods in Pity fix'd her there  And to a Fountain turn'd the weeping Fair  The Fable of IPHIS and IANTHE  By Mr DRYDEN  The Fame of this perhaps thro'  Crete  had flown  But  Crete  had newer Wonders of her own  In  Iphis  chang'd For near the  Gnossian  Bounds  As loud Report the Miracle resounds  At  Phoestus  dwelt a Man of honest Blood  But meanly born and not so rich as good  Esteem'd and lov'd by all the Neighbourhood  Who to his Wife before the Time assign'd  For Childbirth came thus bluntly spoke his Mind  If Heav'n said  Lygdus  will vouchsafe to hear  I have but two Petitions to prefer  Short Pains for thee for me a Son and Heir  Girls cost as many Throws in bringing forth  Besides when born the Titts are little worth  Weak puling things unable to sustain  Their Share of Labour and their Bread to gain  If therefore thou a Creature shalt produce  Of so great Charges and so little Use  Bear witness Heav'n with what Reluctancy  Her hapless Innocence I doom to dye  He said and Tears the common Grief display  Of him who bad and her who must obey  Yet  Telethusa  still persists to find  Fit Arguments to move a Father's Mind  T' extend his Wishes to a larger Scope  And in one Vessel not confine his Hope  Lygdus  continues hard Her Time drew near  And she her heavy Load cou'd scarcely bear  When slumb'ring in the latter Shades of Night  Before th' Approaches of returning Light  She saw or thought she saw before her Bed  A glorious Train and  Isis  at their Head  Her moony Horns were on her Forehead plac'd  And yellow Sheaves her shining Temples grac'd  A Mitre for a Crown she wore on high  The Dog and dappl'd Bull were waiting by  Osyris  sought along the Banks of  Nile    The silent God the sacred Crocodile  And last a long Procession moving on  With Timbrels that assist the lab'ring Moon  Her Slumbers seem'd dispell'd and broad awake  She heard a Voice that thus distinctly spake  My Votary thy Babe from Death defend  Nor fear to save whate'er the Gods will send  Delude with Art thy Husband's dire Decree  When Danger calls repose thy Trust on me  And know thou hast not serv'd a thankless Deity  This Promise made with Night the Goddess fled  With Joy the Woman wakes and leaves her Bed  Devoutly lifts her spotless Hands on high  And prays the Pow'rs their Gift to ratifie  Now grinding Pains proceed to bearing Throws  Till its own Weight the Burden did disclose  'Twas of the beauteous Kind and brought to Light  With Secrecy to shun the Father's Sight  Th' indulgent Mother did her Care employ  And pass'd it on her Husband for a Boy  The Nurse was conscious of the Fact alone  The Father paid his Vows as for a Son  And call'd him  Iphis  by a common Name  Which either Sex with equal Right may claim  Iphis  his Grandsire was the Wife was pleas'd  Of half the Fraud by Fortune's Favour eas'd  The doubtful Name was us'd without Deceit  And Truth was cover'd with a pious Cheat  The Habit shew'd a Boy the beauteous Face  With manly Fierceness mingl'd female Grace  Now thirteen Years of Age were swiftly run  When the fond Father thought the time drew on  Of settling in the World his only Son  Ianthe  was his Choice so wondrous fair  Her Form alone with  Iphis  cou'd compare  A Neighbour's Daughter of his own Degree  And not more bless'd with Fortune's Goods than he  They soon espous'd for they with Ease were join'd  Who were before contracted in the Mind  Their Age the same their Inclinations too  And bred together in one School they grew  Thus fatally dispos'd to mutual Fires  They felt before they knew the same Desires  Equal their Flame unequal was their Care  One lov'd with Hope one languish'd in Despair  The Maid accus'd the ling'ring Days alone  For whom she thought a Man she thought her own  But  Iphis  bends beneath a greater Grief  As fiercely burns but hopes for no Relief  Ev'n her Despair adds Fuel to her Fire  A Maid with Madness does a Maid desire  And scarce refraining Tears Alas said she  What Issue of my Love remains for me  How wild a Passion works within my Breast  With what prodigious Flames am I possest  Cou'd I the Care of Providence deserve  Heav'n must destroy me if it wou'd preserve  And that's my Fate or sure it wou'd have sent  Some usual Evil for my Punishment  Not this unkindly Curse to rage and burn  Where Nature shews no Prospect of Return  Nor Cows for Cows consume with fruitless Fire  Nor Mares when hot their FellowMares desire  The Father of the Fold supplies his Ewes  The Stag through secret Woods his Hind pursues  And Birds for Mates the Males of their own Species chuse  Her Females Nature guards from Female Flame  And joins two Sexes to preserve the Game  Wou'd I were nothing or not what I am  Crete  fam'd for Monsters wanted of her Store  Till my new Love produc'd one Monster more  The Daughter of the Sun a Bull desir'd  And yet ev'n then a Male a Female fir'd  Her Passion was extravagantly new  But mine is much the madder of the two  To things impossible she was not bent  But found the Means to compass her Intent  To cheat his Eyes she took a different Shape  Yet still she gain'd a Lover and a Leap  Shou'd all the Wit of all the World conspire  Shou'd  Daedalus  assist my wild Desire  What Art can make me able to enjoy  Or what can change  Ianthe  to a Boy  Extinguish then thy Passion hopeless Maid  And recollect thy Reason for thy Aid  Know what thou art and love as Maidens ought  And drive these Golden Wishes from thy Thought  Thou canst not hope thy fond Desires to gain  Where Hope is wanting Wishes are in vain  And yet no Guards against our Joys conspire  No jealous Husband hinders our Desire  My Parents are propitious to my Wish  And she herself consenting to the Bliss  All things concur to prosper our Design  All things to prosper any Love but mine  And yet I never can enjoy the Fair  'Tis past the Pow'r of Heav'n to grant my Pray'r  Heav'n has been kind as far as Heav'n can be  Our Parents with our own Desires agree  But Nature stronger than the Gods above  Refuses her Assistance to my Love  She sets the Bar that causes all my Pain  One Gift refus'd makes all their Bounty vain  And now the happy Day is just at hand  To bind our Hearts in  Hymen  's holy Band  Our Hearts but not our Bodies Thus accurs'd  In midst of Water I complain of Thirst  Why com'st thou  Juno  to these barren Rites  To bless a Bed defrauded of Delights  But why shou'd  Hymen  lift his Torch on high  To see two Brides in cold Embraces lye  Thus Lovesick  Iphis  her vain Passion mourns  With equal Ardour fair  Ianthe  burns  Invoking  Hymen  's Name and  Juno  's Pow'r  To speed the Work and haste the happy Hour  She hopes while  Telethusa  fears the Day  And strives to interpose some new Delay  Now feigns a Sickness now is in a Fright  For this bad Omen or that boding Sight  But having done whate'er she cou'd devise  And empty'd all her Magazine of Lies  The Time approach'd the next ensuing Day  The fatal Secret must to Light betray  Then  Telethusa  had recourse to Pray'r  She and her Daughter with dishevell'd Hair  Trembling with Fear great  Isis  they ador'd  Embrac'd her Altar and her Aid implor'd  Fair Queen who dost on fruitful  Egypt  smile  Who sway'st the Sceptre of the  Pharian  Isle  And sev'nfold Falls of disemboguing  Nile    Relieve in this our last Distress she said  A suppliant Mother and a mournful Maid  Thou Goddess thou wert present to my Sight  Reveal'd I saw thee by thy own fair Light  I saw thee in my Dream as now I see  With all thy Marks of awful Majesty  The glorious Train that compass'd thee around  And heard the hollow Timbrels holy Sound  Thy Words I noted which I still retain  Let not thy sacred Oracles be vain  That  Iphis  lives that I my self am free  From Shame and Punishment I owe to thee  On thy Protection all our Hopes depend  Thy Counsel sav'd us let thy Pow'r defend  Her Tears pursu'd her Words and while she spoke  The Goddess nodded and her Altar shook  The Temple Doors as with a Blast of Wind  Were heard to clap the Lunar Horns that bind  The Brows of  Isis  cast a Blaze around  The trembling Timbrel made a murm'ring Sound  Some Hopes these happy Omens did impart  Forth went the Mother with a beating Heart  Not much in Fear nor fully satisfy'd  But  Iphis  follow'd with a larger Stride  The Whiteness of her Skin forsook her Face  Her Looks embolden'd with an awful Grace  Her Features and her Strength together grew  And her long Hair to curling Locks withdrew  Her sparkling Eyes with manly Vigour shone  Big was her Voice audacious was her Tone  The latent Parts at length reveal'd began  To shoot and spread and burnish into Man  The Maid becomes a Youth no more delay  Your Vows but look and confidently pay  Their Gifts the Parents to the Temple bear  The Votive Tables this Inscription wear  Iphis  the Man has to the Goddess paid  The Vows that  Iphis  offer'd when a Maid  Now when the Star of Day had shewn his Face  Venus  and  Juno  with their Presence grace  The Nuptial Rites and  Hymen  from above  Descending to compleat their happy Love  The Gods of Marriage lend their mutual Aid  And the warm Youth enjoys the lovely Maid  The End of the Ninth Book  To the R  t  Hon  ble  y  e  Lady Viscountess Scudamo  OVID's METAMORPHOSES BOOK X  Translated by Mr DRYDEN Mr CONGREVE and Others  The Story of ORPHEUS and EURYDICE  By Mr CONGREVE  _THENCE in his Saffron Robe for distant  Thrace    Hymen  departs thro' Air's unmeasur'd Space  By  Orpheus  call'd the Nuptial Pow'r attends  But with illomen'd Augury descends  Nor chearful look'd the God nor prosp'rous spoke  Nor blaz'd his Torch but wept in hissing Smoke  In vain they whirl it round in vain they shake  No rapid Motion can its Flames awake  With Dread these inauspicious Signs were view'd  And soon a more disastrous End ensu'd  For as the Bride amid the  Naïad  Train  Ran joyful sporting o'er the flow'ry Plain  A venom'd Viper bit her as she pass'd  Instant she fell and suddain breath'd her last  When long his Loss the  Thracian  had deplor'd  Not by superior Pow'rs to be restor'd  Inflam'd by Love and urg'd by deep Despair  He leaves the Realms of Light and upper Air  Daring to tread the dark  Tenarian  Road  And tempt the Shades in their obscure Abode  Thro' gliding Spectres of th'Interr'd to go  And Phantom People of the World below  Persephonè  he seeks and him who reigns  O'er Ghosts and Hell's uncomfortable Plains  Arriv'd he tuning to his Voice his Strings  Thus to the King and Queen of Shadows sings  Ye Pow'rs who under Earth your Realms extend  To whom all Mortals must one Day descend  If here 'tis granted sacred Truth to tell  I come not curious to explore your Hell  Nor come to boast by vain Ambition fir'd  How  Cerberus  at my Approach retir'd  My Wife alone I seek for her lov'd sake  These Terrors I support this Journey take  She luckless wandring or by Fate misled  Chanc'd on a lurking Viper's Crest to tread  The vengeful Beast enflam'd with Fury starts  And thro' her Heel his deathful Venom darts  Thus was she snatch'd untimely to her Tomb  Her growing Years cut short and springing Bloom  Long I my Loss endeavour'd to sustain  And strongly strove but strove alas in vain  At length I yielded won by mighty Love  Well known is that Omnipotence above  But here I doubt his unfelt Influence fails  And yet a Hope within my Heart prevails  That here ev'n here he has been known of old  At least if Truth be by Tradition told  If Fame of former Rapes Belief may find  You both by Love and Love alone were joyn'd  Now by the Horrors which these Realms surround  By the vast Chaos of these Depths profound  By the sad Silence which eternal reigns  O'er all the Waste of these widestretching Plains  Let me again  Eurydice  receive  Let Fate her quickspun Thread of Life reweave  All our Possessions are but Loans from you  And soon or late you must be paid your Due  Hither we haste to Humankind's last Seat  Your endless Empire and our sure Retreat  She too when ripen'd Years she shall attain  Must of avoidless Right be yours again  I but the transient use of that require  Which soon too soon I must resign entire  But if the Destinies refuse my Vow  And no Remission of her Doom allow  Know I'm determin'd to return no more  So both retain or both to Life restore  Thus while the Bard melodiously complains  And to his Lyre accords his vocal Strains  The very bloodless Shades Attention keep  And silent seem compassionate to weep  Ev'n  Tantalus  his Flood unthirsty views  Nor flies the Stream nor he the Stream pursues  Ixïon  's wondring Wheel its Whirl suspends  And the voracious Vultur charm'd attends  No mroe the  Belides  their Toil bemoan  And  Sisiphus  reclin'd sits list'ning on his Stone  Then first 'tis said by sacred Verse subdu'd  The Furies felt their Cheeks with Tears bedew'd  Nor could the rigid King or Queen of Hell  Th' Impulse of Pity in their Hearts repell  Now from a Troop of Shades that last arriv'd  Eurydice  was call'd and stood reviv'd  Slow she advanc'd and halting seem'd to feel  The fatal Wound yet painful in her Heel  Thus he obtains the Suit so much desir'd  On strict Observance of the Terms requir'd  For if before he reach the Realms of Air  He backward cast his Eyes to view the Fair  The forfeit Grant that Instant void is made  And she for ever left a lifeless Shade  Now thro' the noiseless Throng their Way they bend  And both with Pain the rugged Road ascend  Dark was the Path and difficult and steep  And thick with Vapours from the smoaky Deep  They wellnigh now had pass'd the Bounds of Night  And just approach'd the Margin of the Light  When he mistrusting lest her Steps might stray  And gladsom of the Glimpse of dawning Day  His longing Eyes impatient backward cast  To catch a Lover's Look but look'd his last  For instant dying she again descends  While he to empty Air his Arms extends  Again she dy'd nor yet her Lord reprov'd  What cou'd she say but that too well he lov'd  One last Farewel she spoke which scarce he heard  So soon she drop'd so suddain disappear'd  All stunn'd he stood when thus his Wife he view'd  By second Fate and double Death subdu'd  Not more Amazement by that Wretch was shown  Whom  Cerberus  beholding turn'd to Stone  Nor  Ollenus  cou'd more astonish'd look  When on himself  Lethaea  's Fault he took  His beauteous Wife who too secure had dar'd  Her Face to vye with Goddesses compar'd  Once join'd by Love they stand united still  Turn'd to contiguous Rocks on  Ida  's Hill  Now to repass the  Styx  in vain he tries  Charon  averse his pressing Suit denies  Seven Days entire along th' infernal Shores  Disconsolate the Bard  Eurydice  deplores  Defil'd with Filth his Robe with Tears his Cheeks  No Sustenance but Grief and Cares he seeks  Of rigid Fate incessant he complains  And Hell's inexorable Gods arraigns  This ended to high  Rhodopé  he hastes  And  Haemus  ' Mountain bleek with Northern Blasts  And now his yearly Race the circling Sun  Had thrice compleat thro' watry  Pisces  run  Since  Orpheus  fled the Face of Womankind  And all soft Union with the Sex declin'd  Whether his ill Success this Change had bred  Or binding Vows made to his former Bed  Whate'er the Cause in vain the Nymphs contest  With rival Eyes to warm his frozen Breast  For ev'ry Nymph with Love his Lays inspir'd  But ev'ry Nymph repuls'd with Grief retir'd  A Hill there was and on that Hill a Mead  With Verdure thick but destitute of Shade  Where now the Muse's Son no sooner sings  No sooner strikes his sweet resounding Strings  But distant Groves the flying Sounds receive  And listning Trees their rootes Stations leave  Themselves transplanting all around they grow  And various Shades their various Kinds bestow  Here tall  Chaönian  Oaks their Branches spread  While weeping Poplars there erect their Head  The foodful  Esculus  here shoots his Leaves  That Turf soft Limetree this fat Beach receives  Here brittle Hazels Lawrels here advance  And there tough Ash to form the Heroe's Lance  Here Silver Firs with knotless Trunks ascend  There Scarlet Oaks beneath their Acorns bend  That Spot admits the hospitable Plane  On this the Maple grows with clouded Grain  Here watry Willows are with  Lotus  seen  There Tamarisk and Box for ever green  With double Hue here Mirtles grace the Ground  And Laurestines with purple Berries crown'd  With pliant Feet now Ivies this way wind  Vines yonder rise and Elms with Vines entwin'd  Wild  Ornus  now the Pitchtree next takes root  And  Arbutus  adorn'd with blushing Fruit  Then easybending Palms the Victor's Prize  And Pines erect with bristly Tops arise  To  Rhea  grateful still the Pine remains  For  Atys  still some Favour she retains  He once in Human Shape her Breast had warm'd  And now is cherish'd to a Tree transform'd  The Fable of CYPARISSUS  Amid the Throng of this promiscuous Wood  With pointed Top the taper Cypress stood  A Tree which once a Youth and heav'nly fair  Was of that Deity the darling Care  Whose Hand adapts with equal Skill the Strings  To Bows with which he kills and Harps to which he sings  For heretofore a mighty Stag was bred  Which on the fertile Fields of  Caea  fed  In Shape and Size he all his Kind excell'd  And to  Carthaean  Nymphs was sacred held  His beamy Head with Branches high display'd  Afforded to itself an ample Shade  His Horns were gilt and his smooth Neck was grac'd  With Silver Collars thick with Gems enchas'd  A Silver Boss upon his Forehead hung  And brazen Pendants in his Earrings rung  Frequenting Houses he familiar grew  And learnt by Custom Nature to subdue  Till by degrees of Fear and Wildness broke  Ev'n Stranger Hands his proffer'd Neck might stroak  Much was the Beast by  Caea  's Youth caress'd  But thou sweet  Cyparissus  lov'dst him best  By thee to Pastures fresh he oft was led  By thee oft water'd at the Fountain's Head  His Horns with Garlands now by thee were ty'd  And now thou on his Back wou'dst wanton ride  Now here now there wou'dst bound along the Plains  Ruling his tender Mouth with purple Reins  'Twas when the Summer Sun at Noon of Day  Thro' glowing  Cancer  shot his burning Ray  'Twas then the fav'rite Stag in cool Retreat  Had sought a Shelter from the scorching Heat  Along the Grass his weary Limbs he laid  Inhaling Freshness from the breezy Shade  When  Cyparissus  with his pointed Dart  Unknowing pierc'd him to the panting Heart  But when the Youth surpriz'd his Error found  And saw him dying of the cruel Wound  Himself he would have slain thro' desp'rate Grief  What said not  Phoebus  that might yield Relief  To cease his Mourning he the Boy desir'd  Or mourn no more than such a Loss requir'd  But he incessant griev'd At length address'd  To the superior Pow'rs a last Request  Praying in Expiation of his Crime  Thenceforth to mourn to all succeeding Time  And now of Blood exhausted he appears  Drain'd by a Torrent of continual Tears  The fleshy Colour in his Body fades  And a green Tincture all his Limbs invades  From his fair Head where curling Locks late hung  A horrid Bush with bristled Branches sprung  Which stiffning by Degrees its Stem extends  Till to the starry Skies the Spire ascends  Apollo  sad look'd on and sighing cry'd  Then be for ever what thy Pray'r imply'd  Bemoan'd by me in others Grief excite  And still preside at ev'ry Fun'ral Rite  Continu'd by Mr CROXALL  Thus the sweet Artist in a wond'rous Shade  Of verdant Trees which Harmony had made  Encircled sate with his own Triumphs crown'd  Of listning Birds and Savages around  Again the trembling Strings he dext'rous tries  Again from Discord makes soft Musick rise  Then tunes his Voice O Muse from whom I sprung  Jove  be my Theme and Thou inspire my Song  To  Jove  my greteful Voice I oft have rais'd  Oft his Almighty Pow'r with Pleasure prais'd  I sung the Giants in a solemn Strain  Blasted and Thunderstruck on  Phlegra  's Plain  Now be my Lire in softer Accents mov'd  To sing of blooming Boys by Gods belov'd  And to relate what Virgins void of Shame  Have suffer'd Vengeance for a lawless Flame  The King of Gods once felt the burning Joy  And sigh'd for lovely  Ganimede  of  Troy    Long was he puzzled to assume a Shape  Most fit and expeditious for the Rape  A Bird's was proper yet he scorns to wear  Any but That which might his Thunder bear  Down with his masquerading Wings he flies  And bears the little  Trojan  to the Skies  Where now in Robes of heav'nly Purple drest  He serves the Nectar at th' Almighty's Feast  To slighted  Juno  an unwelcome Guest  HYACINTHUS transform'd into a Flower  By Mr OZELL  Phoebus  for Thee too  Hyacinth  design'd  A Place among the Gods had Fate been kind  Yet this he gave as oft as wintry Rains  Are past and vernal Breezes sooth the Plains  From the green Turf a purple Flow'r you rise  And with your fragrant Breath perfume the Skies  You when alive were  Phoebus  ' darling Boy  In you he plac'd his Heav'n and fix'd his Joy  Their God the  Delphic  Priests consult in vain  Eurotas  now he loves and  Sparta  's Plain  His Hands the use of Bow and Harp forget  And hold the Dogs or bear the corded Net  O'er hanging Cliffs swift he pursues the Game  Each Hour his Pleasure each augments his Flame  The midday Sun now shone with equal Light  Between the past and the succeeding Night  They strip then smooth'd with suppling Oyl essay  To pitch the rounded Quoit their wonted Play  A wellpois'd Disk first hasty  Phoebus  threw  It cleft the Air and whistled as it flew  It reach'd the Mark a most surprizing Length  Which spoke an equal Share of Art and Strength  Scarce was it fall'n when with too eager Hand  Young  Hyacinth  ran to snatch it from the Sand  But the curst Orb which met a stony Soil  Flew in his Face with violent Recoil  Both faint both pale and breathless now appear  The Boy with Pain the am'rous God with Fear  He ran and rais'd him bleeding from the Ground  Chafes his cold Limbs and wipes the fatal Wound  Then Herbs of noblest Juice in vain applies  The Wound is mortal and his Skill defies  As in a water'd Garden's blooming Walk  When some rude Hand has bruis'd its tender Stalk  A fading Lilly droops its languid Head  And bends to Earth its Life and Beauty fled  So  Hyacinth  with Head reclin'd decays  And sick'ning now no more his Charms displays  O thou art gone my Boy  Apollo  cry'd  Defrauded of thy Youth in all its Pride  Thou once my Joy art all my Sorrow now  And to my guilty Hand my Grief I owe  Yet from my self I might the Fault remove  Unless to sport and play a Fault should prove  Unless it too were call'd a Fault to love  Oh cou'd I for thee or but with thee dye  But cruel Fates to me that Pow'r deny  Yet on my Tongue thou shalt for ever dwell  Thy Name my Lyre shall sound my Verse shall tell  And to a Flow'r transform'd unheard of yet  Stamp'd on thy Leaves my Cries thou shalt repeat  The time shall come prophetick I foreknow  When joyn'd to thee a mighty  Ajax  Chief shall grow  And with my Plaints his Name thy Leaf shall show  While  Phoebus  thus the Laws of Fate reveal'd  Behold the Blood which stain'd the verdant Field  Is Blood no longer but a Flow'r full blown  Far brighter than the  Tyrian  Scarlet shone  A Lilly's Form it took its purple Hue  Was all that made a Diff'rence to the View  Nor stop'd he here the God upon its Leaves  The sad Expression of his Sorrow weaves  And to this Hour the mournful Purple wears  Ai    Ai  inscrib'd in funeral Characters  Nor are the  Spartans  who so much are fam'd  For Virtue of their  Hyacinth  asham'd  But

every Metal does abound  If she to her  Propaetides  wou'd show  The Honour  Sparta  does to him allow  No more she'd say such Wretches wou'd we grace  Than those whose crooked Horns deform'd their Face  From thence  Cerastae  call'd an impious Race  Before whose Gates a rev'rend Altar stood  To  Jove  inscrib'd the hospitable God  This had some Stranger seen with Gore besmear'd  The Blood of Lambs and Bulls it had appear'd  Their slaughter'd Guests it was not Flock nor Herd  Venus  these barb'rous Sacrifices view'd  With just Abhorrence and with Wrath pursu'd  At first to punish such nefarious Crimes  Their Towns she meant to leave her oncelov'd Climes  But why said she for their Offence shou'd I  My dear delightful Plains and Cities fly  No let the impious People who have sinn'd  A Punishment in Death or Exile find  If Death or Exile too severe be thought  Let them in some vile Shape bemoan their Fault  While next her Mind a proper Form employs  Admonish'd by their Horns she fix'd her Choice  Their former Crest remains upon their Heads  And their strong Limbs an Ox's Shape invades  The blasphemous  Propaetides  deny'd  Worship of  Venus  and her Pow'r defy'd  But soon that Pow'r they felt the first that sold  Their lewd Embraces to the World for Gold  Unknowing how to blush and shameless grown  A small Transition changes 'em to Stone  The Story of PYGMALION and the STATUE  By Mr DRYDEN  Pygmalion  loathing their lascivious Life  Abhorr'd all Womankind but most a Wife  So single chose to live and shunn'd to wed  Well pleas'd to want a Consort of his Bed  Yet fearing Idleness the Nurse of Ill  In Sculpture exercis'd his happy Skill  And carv'd in Iv'ry such a Maid so fair  As Nature could not with his Art compare  Were she to work but in her own Defence  Must take her Pattern here and copy hence  Pleas'd with his Idol he commends admires  Adores and last the Thing ador'd desires  A very Virgin in her Face was seen  And had she mov'd a living Maid had been  One wou'd have thought she cou'd have stirr'd but strove  With Modesty and was asham'd to move  Art hid with Art so well perform'd the Cheat  It caught the Carver with his own Deceit  He knows 'tis Madness yet he must adore  And still the more he knows it loves the more  The Flesh or what so seems he touches oft  Which feels so smooth that he believes it soft  Fir'd with this Thought at once he strain'd the Breast  And on the Lips a burning Kiss impress'd  'Tis true the harden'd Breast resists the Gripe  And the cold Lips return a Kiss unripe  But when retiring back he look'd again  To think it Iv'ry was a Thought too mean  So wou'd believe she kiss'd and courting more  Again embrac'd her naked Body o'er  And straining hard the Statue was afraid  His Hands had made a Dint and hurt his Maid  Explor'd her Limb by Limb and fear'd to find  So rude a Gripe had left a livid Mark behind  With Flatt'ry now he seeks her Mind to move  And now with Gifts the pow'rful Bribes of Love  He furnishes her Closet first and fills  The crowded Shelves with Rarities of Shells  Adds Orient Pearls which from the Conchs he drew  And all the sparkling Stones of various Hue  And Parrots imitating Human Tongue  And Singingbirds in Silver Cages hung  And ev'ry fragrant Flow'r and od'rous Green  Were sorted well with Lumps of Amber laid between  Rich fashionable Robes her Person deck  Pendants her Ears and Pearls adorn her Neck  Her taper'd Fingers too with Rings are grac'd  And an embroider'd Zone surrounds her slender Waste  Thus like a Queen array'd so richly dress'd  Beauteous she shew'd but naked shew'd the best  Then from the Floor he rais'd a Royal Bed  With Cov'rings of  Sydonian  Purple spread  The solemn Rites perform'd he calls her Bride  With Blandishments invites her to his Side  And as she were with vital Sense possess'd  Her Head did on a plumy Pillow rest  The Feast of  Venus  came a solemn Day  To which the  Cypriots  due Devotion pay  With gilded Horns the Milkwhite Heifers led  Slaughter'd before the sacred Altars bled  Pygmalion  off'ring first approach'd the Shrine  And then with Pray'rs implor'd the Pow'rs Divine  Almighty Gods if all we Mortals want  If all we can require be yours to grant  Make this fair Statue mine he wou'd have said  But chang'd his Words for Shame and only pray'd  Give me the Likeness of my Iv'ry Maid  The Golden Goddess present at the Pray'r  Well knew he meant th' inanimated Fair  And gave the Sign of granting his Desire  For thrice in chearful Flames ascends the Fire  The Youth returning to his Mistress hies  And impudent in Hope with ardent Eyes  And beating Breast by the dear Statue lies  He kisses her white Lips renews the Bliss  And looks and thinks they redden at the Kiss  He thought them warm before Nor longer stays  But next his Hand on her hard Bosom lays  Hard as it was beginning to relent  It seem'd the Breast beneath his Fingers bent  He felt again his Fingers made a Print  'Twas Flesh but Flesh so firm it rose against the Dint  The pleasing Task he fails not to renew  Soft and more soft at ev'ry Touch it grew  Like pliant Wax when chafing Hands reduce  The former Mass to Form and frame for Use  He would believe but yet is still in Pain  And tries his Argument of Sense again  Presses the Pulse and feels the leaping Vein  Convinc'd o'erjoy'd his studied Thanks and Praise  To her who made the Miracle he pays  Then Lips to Lips he join'd now freed from Fear  He found the Savour of the Kiss sincere  At this the waken'd Image op'd her Eyes  And view'd at once the Light and Lover with Surprize  The Goddess present at the Match she made  So bless'd the Bed such Fruitfulness convey'd  That e're ten Months had sharpen'd either Horn  To crown their Bliss a lovely Boy was born  Paphos  his Name who grown to Manhood wall'd  The City  Paphos  from the Founder call'd  The Story of CINYRAS and MYRRHA  Nor him alone produc'd the fruitful Queen  But  Cinyras  who like his Sire had been  A happy Prince had he not been a Sire  Daughters and Fathers from my Song retire  I sing of Horror and could I prevail  You shou'd not hear or not believe my Tale  Yet if the Pleasure of my Song be such  That you will hear and credit me too much  Attentive listen to the last Event  And with the Sin believe the Punishment  Since Nature cou'd behold so dire a Crime  I gratulate at least my Native Clime  That such a Land which such a Monster bore  So far is distant from our  Thracian  Shore  Let  Araby  extol her happy Coast  Her Cinamon and sweet  Amomum  boast  Her fragrant Flow'rs her Trees with precious Tears  Her second Harvests and her double Years  How can the Land be call'd so bless'd that  Myrrha  bears  Nor all her od'rous Tears can cleanse her Crime  Her Plant alone deforms the happy Clime  Cupid  denies to have inflam'd thy Heart  Disowns thy Love and vindicates his Dart  Some Fury gave thee those infernal Pains  And shot her venom'd Vipers in thy Veins  To hate thy Sire had merited a Curse  But such an impious Love deserv'd a worse  The neighb'ring Monarchs by thy Beauty led  Contend in Crowds ambitious of thy Bed  The World is at thy Choice except but one  Except but him thou canst not chuse alone  She knew it too the miserable Maid  E're impious Love her better Thoughts betray'd  And thus within her secret Soul she said  Ah  Myrrha  whither wou'd thy Wishes tend  Ye Gods ye sacred Laws my Soul defend  From such a Crime as all Mankind detest  And never lodg'd before in Human Breast  But is it Sin Or makes my Mind alone  Th' imagin'd Sin For Nature makes it none  What Tyrant then these envious Laws began  Made not for any other Beast but Man  The FatherBull his Daughter may bestride  The Horse may make his MotherMare a Bride  What Piety forbids the lusty Ram  Or more salacious Goat to rut their Dam  The Hen is free to wed the Chick she bore  And make a Husband whom she hatch'd before  All Creatures else are of a happier Kind  Whom nor illnatur'd Laws from Pleasure bind  Nor Thoughts of Sin disturb their Peace of Mind  But Man a Slave of his own making lives  The Fool denies himself what Nature gives  Too busie Senates with an Overcare  To make us better than our Kind can bear  Have dash'd a Spice of Envy in the Laws  And straining up too high have spoil'd the Cause  Yet some wise Nations break their cruel Chains  And own no Laws but those which Love ordains  Where happy Daughters with their Sires are join'd  And Piety is doubly paid in Kind  O that I had been born in such a Clime  Not here where 'tis the Country makes the Crime  But whither wou'd my impious Fancy stray  Hence Hopes and ye forbidden Thoughts away  His Worth deserves to kindle my Desires  But with the Love that Daughters bear to Sires  Then had not  Cinyras  my Father been  What hinder'd  Myrrha  's Hopes to be his Queen  But the Perverseness of my Fate is such  That he's not mine because he's mine too much  Our KindredBlood debars a better Tie  He might be nearer were he not so nigh  Eyes and their Objects never must unite  Some Distance is requir'd to help the Sight  Fain wou'd I travel to some foreign Shore  Never to see my Native Country more  So might I to my self my self restore  So might my Mind these impious Thoughts remove  And ceasing to behold might cease to love  But stay I must to feed my famish'd Sight  To talk to kiss and more if more I might  More impious Maid What more canst thou design  To make a monstrous Mixture in thy Line  And break all Statutes Human and Divine  Can'st thou be call'd to save thy wretched Life  Thy Mother's Rival and thy Father's Wife  Confound so many sacred Names in one  Thy Brother's Mother Sister to thy Son  And fear'st thou not to see th'Infernal Bands  Their Heads with Snakes with Torches arm'd their Hands  Full at thy Face th'avenging Brands to bear  And shake the Serpents from their hissing Hair  But thou in time th'increasing Ill controul  Nor first debauch the Body by the Soul  Secure the sacred Quiet of thy Mind  And keep the Sanctions Nature has design'd  Suppose I shou'd attempt th'Attempt were vain  No Thoughts like mine his sinless Soul profane  Observant of the Right and O that he  Cou'd cure my Madness or be mad like me  Thus she But  Cinyras  who daily sees  A Crowd of noble Suitors at his Knees  Among so many knew not whom to chuse  Irresolute to grant or to refuse  But having told their Names enquir'd of her  Who pleas'd her best and whom she would prefer  The blushing Maid stood silent with Surprize  And on her Father fix'd her ardent Eyes  And looking sigh'd and as she sigh'd began  Round Tears to shed that scalded as they ran  The tender Sire who saw her blush and cry  Ascrib'd it all to Maiden Modesty  And dry'd the falling Drops and yet more kind  He stroak'd her Cheeks and holy Kisses join'd  She felt a secret Venom fire her Blood  And found more Pleasure than a Daughter shou'd  And ask'd again what Lover of the Crew  She lik'd the best she answer'd One like you  Mistaking what she meant her pious Will  He prais'd and bad her so continue still  The Word of Pious heard she blush'd with Shame  Of secret Guilt and cou'd not bear the Name  'Twas now the Mid of Night when Slumbers close  Our Eyes and sooth our Cares with soft Repose  But no Repose cou'd wretched  Myrrha  find  Her Body rouling as she roul'd her Mind  Mad with Desire she ruminates her Sin  And wishes all her Wishes o'er again  Now she despairs and now resolves to try  Wou'd not and wou'd again she knows not why  Stops and returns makes and retracts the Vow  Fain wou'd begin but understands not how  As when a Pine is hew'd upon the Plains  And the last mortal Stroke alone remains  Lab'ring in Pangs of Death and threatning all  This way and that she nods consid'ring where to fall  So  Myrrha  's Mind impell'd on either Side  Takes ev'ry Bent but cannot long abide  Irresolute on which she shou'd relie  At last unfix'd in all is only fix'd to die  On that sad Thought she rests resolv'd on Death  She rises and prepares to choak her Breath  Then while about the Beam her Zone she ties  Dear  Cinyras  farewell she softly cries  For thee I die and only wish to be  Not hated when thou know'st I die for thee  Pardon the Crime in Pity to the Cause  This said about her Neck the Noose she draws  The Nurse who lay without her faithful Guard  Though not the Words the Murmurs overheard  And Sighs and hollow Sounds Surpriz'd with Fright  She starts and leaves her Bed and springs a Light  Unlocks the Door and entring out of Breath  The Dying saw and Instruments of Death  She shrieks she cuts the Zone with trembling Haste  And in her Arms her fainting Charge embrac'd  Next for she now had Leisure for her Tears  She weeping ask'd in these her blooming Years  What unforeseen Misfortune caus'd her Care  To loath her Life and languish in Despair  The Maid with downcast Eyes and mute with Grief  For Death unfinish'd and illtim'd Relief  Stood sullen to her Suit The Beldame press'd  The more to know and bar'd her wither'd Breast  Adjur'd her by the kindly Food she drew  From those dry Founts her secret Ill to shew  Sad  Myrrha  sigh'd and turn'd her Eyes aside  The Nurse still urg'd and wou'd not be deny'd  Nor only promis'd Secresie but pray'd  She might have Leave to give her offer'd Aid  Goodwill she said my want of Strength supplies  And Diligence shall give what Age denies  If strong Desires thy Mind to Fury move  With Charms and Med'cines I can cure thy Love  If envious Eyes their hurtful Rays have cast  More pow'rful Verse shall free thee from the Blast  If Heav'n offended sends thee this Disease  Offended Heav'n with Pray'rs we can appease  What then remains that can these Cares procure  Thy House is flourishing thy Fortune sure  Thy careful Mother yet in Health survives  And to thy Comfort thy kind Father lives  The Virgin started at her Father's Name  And sigh'd profoundly conscious of the Shame  Nor yet the Nurse her impious Love divin'd  But yet surmis'd that Love disturb'd her Mind  Thus thinking she pursu'd her Point and laid  And lull'd within her Lap the mourning Maid  Then softly sooth'd her thus I guess your Grief  You love my Child your Love shall find Relief  My longexperienc'd Age shall be your Guide  Rely on that and lay Distrust aside  No Breath of Air shall on the Secret blow  Nor shall what most you fear your Father know  Struck once again as with a Thunderclap  The guilty Virgin bounded from her Lap  And threw her Body prostrate on the Bed  And to conceal her Blushes hid her Head  There silent lay and warn'd her with her Hand  To go But she receiv'd not the Command  Remaining still importunate to know  Then  Myrrha  thus Or ask no more or go  I prithee go or staying spare my Shame  What thou would'st hear is impious ev'n to name  At this on high the Beldame holds her Hands  And trembling both with Age and Terror stands  Adjures and falling at her Feet intreats  Sooths her with Blandishments and frights with Threats  To tell the Crime intended or disclose  What Part of it she knew if she no farther knows  And last if conscious to her Counsel made  Confirms anew the Promise of her Aid  Now  Myrrha  rais'd her Head but soon oppress'd  With Shame reclin'd it on her Nurse's Breast  Bath'd it with Tears and strove to have confess'd  Twice she began and stopp'd again she try'd  The falt'ring Tongue its Office still deny'd  At last her Veil before her Face she spread  And drew a long preluding Sigh and said  O happy Mother in thy Marriagebed  Then groan'd and ceas'd The good old Woman shook  Stiff were her Eyes and ghastly was her Look  Her hoary Hair upright with Horror stood  Made to her Grief more knowing than she wou'd  Much she reproach'd and many things she said  To cure the Madness of th'unhappy Maid  In vain For  Myrrha  stood convict of Ill  Her Reason vanquish'd but unchang'd her Will  Perverse of Mind unable to reply  She stood resolv'd or to possess or die  At length the Fondness of a Nurse prevail'd  Against her better Sense and Virtue fail'd  Enjoy my Child since such is thy Desire  Thy Love she said she durst not say thy Sire  Live though unhappy live on any Terms  Then with a second Oath her Faith confirms  The solemn Feast of  Ceres  now was near  When long white Linnen Stoles the Matrons wear  Rank'd in Procession walk the pious Train  Off'ring Firstfruits and Spikes of yellow Grain  For nine long Nights the NuptialBed they shun  And sanctifying Harvest lie alone  Mix'd with the Crowd the Queen forsook her Lord  And  Ceres  ' Pow'r with secret Rites ador'd  The Royal Couch now vacant for a Time  The crafty Crone officious in her Crime  The first Occasion took The King she found  Easie with Wine and deep in Pleasures drown'd  Prepar'd for Love The Beldame blew the Flame  Confess'd the Passion but conceal'd the Name  Her Form she prais'd the Monarch ask'd her Years  And she reply'd The same thy  Myrrha  bears  Wine and commended Beauty fir'd his Thought  Impatient he commands her to be brought  Pleas'd with her Charge perform'd she hies her home  And gratulates the Nymph the Task was overcome  Myrrha  was joy'd the welcome News to hear  But clogg'd with Guilt the Joy was unsincere  So various so discordant is the Mind  That in our Will a diff'rent Will we find  Ill she presag'd and yet pursu'd her Lust  For guilty Pleasures give a double Gust  'Twas Depth of Night  Arctophylax  had driv'n  His lazy Wain half round the Northern Heav'n  When  Myrrha  hasten'd to the Crime desir'd  The Moon beheld her first and first retir'd  The Stars amaz'd ran backward from the Sight  And shrunk within their Sockets lost their Light  Icarius  first withdraws his holy Flame  The Virgin Sign in Heav'n the second Name  Slides down the Belt and from her Station flies  And Night with sable Clouds involves the Skies  Bold  Myrrha  still pursues her black Intent  She stumbled thrice an Omen of th'Event  Thrice shriek'd the Fun'ral Owl yet on she went  Secure of Shame because secure of Sight  Ev'n bashful Sins are impudent by Night  Link'd Hand in Hand th'Accomplice and the Dame  Their Way exploring to the Chamber came  The Door was ope they blindly grope their Way  Where dark in Bed th'expecting Monarch lay  Thus far her Courage held but here forsakes  Her faint Knees knock at ev'ry Step she makes  The nearer to her Crime the more within  She feels Remorse and Horror of her Sin  Repents too late her criminal Desire  And wishes that unknown she cou'd retire  Her lingring thus the Nurse who fear'd Delay  The fatal Secret might at length betray  Pull'd forward to compleat the Work begun  And said to  Cinyras  Receive thy own  Thus saying she deliver'd Kind to Kind  Accurs'd and their devoted Bodies join'd  The Sire unknowing of the Crime admits  His Bowels and profanes the hallow'd Sheets  He found she trembled but believ'd she strove  With Maiden Modesty against her Love  And sought with flatt'ring Words vain Fancies to remove  Perhaps he said My Daughter cease thy Fears  Because the Title suited with her Years  And Father she might whisper him again  That Names might not be wanting to the Sin  Full of her Sire she left th' incestuous Bed  And carry'd in her Womb the Crime she bred  Another and another Night she came  For frequent Sin had left no Sense of Shame  Till  Cinyras  desir'd to see her Face  Whose Body he had held in close Embrace  And brought a Taper the Revealer Light  Expos'd both Crime and Criminal to Sight  Grief Rage Amazement cou'd no Speech afford  But from the Sheath he drew th' avenging Sword  The Guilty fled The Benefit of Night  That favour'd first the Sin secur'd the Flight  Long wandring thro' the spacious Fields she bent  Her Voyage to th'  Arabian  Continent  Then pass'd the Region which  Panchaea  join'd  And flying left the palmy Plains behind  Nine times the Moon had mew'd her Horns at length  With Travel weary unsupply'd with Strength  And with the Burden of her Womb oppress'd  Sabaean  Fields afford her needful Rest  There loathing Life and yet of Death afraid  In Anguish of her Spirit thus she pray'd  Ye Pow'rs if any so propitious are  T'accept my Penitence and hear my Pray'r  Your Judgments I confess are justly sent  Great Sins deserve as great a Punishment  Yet since my Life the Living will profane  And since my Death the happy Dead will stain  A middle State your Mercy may bestow  Betwixt the Realms above and those below  Some other Form to wretched  Myrrha  give  Nor let her wholly die nor wholly live  The Pray'rs of Penitents are never vain  At least she did her last Request obtain  For while she spoke the Ground began to rise  And gather'd round her Feet her Legs and Thighs  Her Toes in Roots descend and spreading wide  A firm Foundation for the Trunk provide  Her solid Bones convert to solid Wood  To Pith her Marrow and to Sap her Blood  Her Arms are Boughs her Fingers change their Kind  Her tender Skin is harden'd into Rind  And now the rising Tree her Womb invests  Now shooting upwards still invades her Breasts  And shades the Neck when weary with Delay  She sunk her Head within and met it half the way  And though with outward Shape she lost her Sense  With bitter Tears she wept her last Offence  And still she weeps nor sheds her Tears in vain  For still the precious Drops her Name retain  Mean time the misbegotten Infant grows  And ripe for Birth distends with deadly Throws  The swelling Rind with unavailing Strife  To leave the wooden Womb and pushes into Life  The MotherTree as if oppress'd with Pain  Writhes here and there to break the Bark in vain  And like a lab'ring Woman wou'd have pray'd  But wants a Voice to call  Lucina  's Aid  The bending Bole sends out a hollow Sound  And trickling Tears fall thicker on the Ground  The mild  Lucina  came uncall'd and stood  Beside the strugling Boughs and heard the groaning Wood  Then reach'd her MidwifeHand to speed the Throws  And spoke the pow'rful Spells that Babes to Birth disclose  The Bark divides the living Load to free  And safe delivers the Convulsive Tree  The ready Nymphs receive the crying Child  And wash him in the Tears the ParentPlant distill'd  They swath'd him with their Scarfs beneath him spread  The Ground with Herbs with Roses rais'd his Head  The lovely Babe was born with ev'ry Grace  Ev'n Envy must have prais'd so fair a Face  Such was his Form as Painters when they show  Their utmost Art on naked Loves bestow  And that their Arms no Diff'rence might betray  Give him a Bow or his from  Cupid  take away  Time glides along with undiscover'd Haste  The Future but a Length behind the Past  So swift are Years The Babe whom just before  His Grandsire got and whom his Sister bore  The Drop the Thing which late the Tree inclos'd  And late the yawning Bark to Life expos'd  A Babe a Boy a beauteous Youth appears  And lovelier than himself at riper Years  Now to the Queen of Love he gave Desires  And with her Pains reveng'd his Mother's Fires  The Story of VENUS and ADONIS  By Mr EUSDEN  For  Cytherëa  's Lips while  Cupid  prest  He with a heedless Arrow raz'd her Breast  The Goddess felt it and with Fury stung  The wanton Mischief from her Bosom flung  Yet thought at first the Danger slight but found  The Dart too faithful and too deep the Wound  Fir'd with a mortal Beauty she disdains  To haunt th'  Idalian  Mount or  Phrygian  Plains  She seeks not  Cnidos  nor her  Paphian  Shrines  Nor  Amathus  that teems with brazen Mines  Ev'n Heav'n it self with all its Sweets unsought  Adonis  far a sweeter Heav'n is thought  On him she hangs and fonds with ev'ry Art  And never never knows from him to part  She whose soft Limbs had only been display'd  On rosie Beds beneath the Myrtle Shade  Whose pleasing Care was to improve each Grace  And add more Charms to an unrival'd Face  Now buskin'd like the Virgin Huntress goes  Thro' Woods and pathless Wilds and MountainSnows  With her own tuneful Voice she joys to cheer  The panting Hounds that chace the flying Deer  She runs the Labyrinths of fearful Hares  But fearless Beasts and dang'rous Prey forbears  Hunts not the grinning Wolf or foamy Boar  And trembles at the Lion's hungry Roar  Thee too  Adonis  with a Lover's Care  She warns if warn'd thou would'st avoid the Snare  To furious Animals advance not nigh  Fly those that follow follow those that fly  'Tis Chance alone must the Survivers save  Whene'er brave Spirits will attempt the Brave  O lovely Youth in harmless Sports delight  Provoke not Beasts which arm'd by Nature fight  For me if not thy self vouchsafe to fear  Let not thy Thirst of Glory cost me dear  Boars know not how to spare a blooming Age  No sparkling Eyes can sooth the Lion's Rage  Not all thy Charms a savage Breast can move  Which have so deeply touch'd the Queen of Love  When bristled Boars from beaten Thickets spring  In grinded Tusks a Thunderbolt they bring  The daring Hunters Lions rouz'd devour  Vast is their Fury and as vast their Pow'r  Curst be their tawny Race If thou would'st hear  What kindled thus my Hate then lend an Ear  The wond'rous Tale I will to thee unfold  How the fell Monsters rose from Crimes of old  But by long Toils I faint See widedisplay'd  A grateful Poplar courts us with a Shade  The grassy Turf beneath so verdant shows  We may secure delightfully repose  With her  Adonis  here be  Venus  blest  And swift at once the Grass and him she prest  Then sweetly smiling with a raptur'd Mind  On his lov'd Bosom she her Head reclin'd  And thus began but mindful still of Bliss  Seal'd the soft Accents with a softer Kiss  Perhaps thou may'st have heard a Virgin's Name  Who still in Swiftness swiftest Youths o'ercame  Wond'rous that female Weakness should outdo  A manly Strength the Wonder yet is true  'Twas doubtful if her Triumphs in the Field  Did to her Form's triumphant Glories yield  Whether her Face could with more Ease decoy  A Crowd of Lovers or her Feet destroy  For once  Apollo  she implor'd to show  If courteous Fates a Consort would allow  A Consort brings thy Ruin he reply'd  Oh learn to want the Pleasures of a Bride  Nor shalt thou want them to thy wretched Cost  And  Atalanta  living shall be lost  With such a rueful Fate th'affrighted Maid  Sought green Recesses in the woodland Glade  Not sighing Suiters her Resolves could move  She bad them show their Speed to show their Love  He only who could conquer in the Race  Might hope the conquer'd Virgin to embrace  While he whose tardy Feet had lagg'd behind  Was doom'd the sad Reward of Death to find  Tho' great the Prize yet rigid the Decree  But blind with Beauty who can Rigour see  Ev'n on these Laws the Fair they rashly sought  And Danger in Excess of Love forgot  There sate  Hippomenes  prepar'd to blame  In Lovers such Extravagance of Flame  And must he said the Blessing of a Wife  Be dearly purchas'd by a Risk of Life  But when he saw the Wonders of her Face  And her Limbs naked springing to the Race  Her Limbs as exquisitely turn'd as mine  Or if a Woman thou might vie with thine  With lifted Hands he cry'd forgive the Tongue  Which durst ye Youths your welltim'd Courage wrong  I knew not that the Nymph for whom you strove  Deserv'd th'unbounded Transports of your Love  He saw admir'd and thus her spotless Frame  He prais'd and praising kindled his own Flame  A Rival now to all the Youths who run  Envious he fears they should not be undone  But why reflects he idly thus is shown  The Fate of others yet untry'd my own  The Coward must not on Love's Aid depend  The God was ever to the Bold a Friend  Mean time the Virgin flies or seems to fly  Swift as a  Scythian  Arrow cleaves the Sky  Still more and more the Youth her Charms admires  The Race it self t' exalt her Charms conspires  The golden Pinions which her Feet adorn  In wanton Flutt'rings by the Winds are born  Down from her Head the long fair Tresses flow  And sport with lovely Negligence below  The waving Ribbands which her Buskins tie  Her snowy Skin with waving Purple die  As crimson Veils in Palaces display'd  To the white Marble lend a blushing Shade  Nor long he gaz'd yet while he gaz'd she gain'd  The Goal and the victorious Wreath obtain'd  The Vanquish'd sigh and as the Law decreed  Pay the dire Forfeit and prepare to bleed  Then rose  Hippomenes  not yet afraid  And fix'd his Eyes full on the beauteous Maid  Where is he cry'd the mighty Conquest won  To distance those who want the Nerves to run  Here prove superior Strength nor shall it be  Thy Loss of Glory if excell'd by me  High my Descent near  Neptune  I aspire  For  Neptune  was GrandParent to my Sire  From that great God the fourth my self I trace  Nor sink my Virtues yet beneath my Race  Thou from  Hippomenes  o'ercome may'st claim  An envy'd Triumph and a deathless Fame  While thus the Youth the Virgin's Pow'r defies  Silent she views him still with softer Eyes  Thoughts in her Breast a doubtful Strife begin  If 'tis not happier now to lose than win  What God a Foe to Beauty would destroy  The promis'd Ripeness of this blooming Boy  With his Life's Danger does he seek my Bed  Scarce am I half so greatly Worth she said  Nor has his Beauty mov'd my Breast to love  And yet I own such Beauty well might move  'Tis not his Charms 'tis Pity would engage  My Soul to spare the Greeness of his Age  What that heroick Courage fires his Breast  And shines thro' brave Disdain of Fate confest  What that his Patronage by close Degrees  Springs from th' imperial Ruler of the Seas  Then add the Love which bids him undertake  The Race and dare to perish for my sake  Of bloody Nuptials heedless Youth beware  Fly timely fly from a too barb'rous Fair  At Pleasure chuse thy Love will be repaid  By a less foolish and more beauteous Maid  But why this Tenderness before unknown  Why beats and pants my Breast for him alone  His Eyes have seen his num'rous Rivals yield  Let him too share the Rigour of the Field  Since by their Fates untaught his own he courts  And thus with Ruin insolently sports  Yet for what Crime shall he his Death receive  Is it a Crime with me to wish to live  Shall his kind Passion his Destruction prove  Is this the fatal Recompence of Love  So fair a Youth destroy'd would Conquest shame  And Nymphs eternally detest my Fame  Still why should Nymphs my guiltless Fame upbraid  Did I the fond Adventurer perswade  Alas I wish thou would'st the Course decline  Or that my Swiftness was excell'd by thine  See what a Virgin's Bloom adorns the Boy  Why wilt thou run and why thy self destroy  Hippomenes  O that I ne'er had been  By those bright Eyes unfortunately seen  Ah tempt not thus a swift untimely Fate  Thy Life is worthy of the longest Date  Were I less wretched did the galling Chain  Of rigid Gods not my free Choice restrain  By thee alone I could with Joy be led  To taste the Raptures of a Nuptial Bed  Thus she disclos'd the Woman's secret Heart  Young innocent and new to  Cupid  's Dart  Her Thoughts her Words her Actions wildly rove  With Love she burns yet knows not that 'tis Love  Her Royal Sire now with the murm'ring Crowd  Demands the Race impatiently aloud  Hippomenes  then with true Fervour pray'd  My bold Attempt let  Venus  kindly aid  By her sweet Pow'r I felt this am'rous Fire  Still may she succour whom she did inspire  A soft unenvious Wind with speedy Care  Wafted to Heav'n the Lover's tender Pray'r  Pity I own soon gain'd the wish'd Consent  And all th' Assistance he implor'd I lent  The  Cyprian  Lands tho' rich in Richness yield  To that surnam'd the  Tamasenian  Field  That Field of old was added to my Shrine  And its choice Products consecrated mine  A Tree there stands full glorious to behold  Gold are the Leafs the crackling Branches Gold  It chanc'd three Apples in my Hands I bore  Which newly from the Tree I sportive tore  Seen by the Youth alone to him I brought  The Fruit and when and how to use it taught  The Signal sounding by the King's Command  Both start at once and sweep th'unprinted Sand  So swiftly move their Feet they might with Ease  Scarce moisten'd skim along the glassie Seas  Or with a wond'rous Levity be born  O'er yellow Harvests of unbending Corn  Now fav'ring Peals resound from ev'ry Part  Spirit the Youth and fire his fainting Heart  Hippomenes  they cry'd thy Life preserve  Intensely labour and stretch ev'ry Nerve  Base Fear alone can baffle thy Design  Shoot boldly onward and the Goal is thine  'Tis doubtful whether Shouts like these convey'd  More Pleasures to the Youth or to the Maid  When a long Distance oft she could have gain'd  She check'd her Swiftness and her Feet restrain'd  She sigh'd and dwelt and languish'd on his Face  Then with unwilling Speed pursu'd the Race  O'erspent with Heat his Breath he faintly drew  Parch'd was his Mouth nor yet the Goal in view  And the first Apple on the Plain he threw  The Nymph stop'd sudden at th'unusual Sight  Struck with the Fruit so beautifully bright  Aside she starts the Wonder to behold  And eager stoops to catch the rouling Gold  Th'observant Youth past by and scour'd along  While Peals of Joy rung from th' applauding Throng  Unkindly she corrects the short Delay  And to redeem the Time fleets swift away  Swift as the Light'ning or the Northern Wind  And far she leaves the panting Youth behind  Again he strives the flying Nymph to hold  With the Temptation of the second Gold  The bright Temptation fruitlesly was tost  So soon alas she won the Distance lost  Now but a little Interval of Space  Remain'd for the Decision of the Race  Fair Author of the precious Gift he said  Be thou O Goddess Author of my Aid  Then of the shining Fruit the last he drew  And with his fullcollected Vigour threw  The Virgin still the longer to detain  Threw not directly but across the Plain  She seem'd awhile perplex'd in dubious Thought  If the fardistant Apple should be sought  I lur'd her backward Mind to seize the Bait  And to the massie Gold gave double Weight  My Favour to my Votary was show'd  Her Speed I lessen'd and encreas'd her

for Victory  His pious Incense on my Altars laid  But he nor grateful Thanks nor Incense paid  Enrag'd I vow'd that with the Youth the Fair  For his Contempt should my keen Vengeance share  That future Lovers might my Pow'r revere  And from their sad Examples learn to fear  The silent Fanes the sanctify'd Abodes  Of  Cybelé  great Mother of the Gods  Rais'd by  Echion  in a lonely Wood  And full of brown religious Horror stood  By a long painful Journey faint they chose  Their weary Limbs here secret to repose  But soon my Pow'r inflam'd the lustful Boy  Careless of Rest he sought untimely Joy  A hallow'd gloomy Cave with Moss o'ergrown  The Temple joyn'd of native Pumicestone  Where antique Images by Priests were kept  And wooden Deities securely slept  Thither the rash  Hippomenes  retires  And gives a Loose to all his wild Desires  And the chaste Cell pollutes with wanton Fires  The sacred Statues trembled with Surprize  The tow'ry Goddess blushing veil'd her Eyes  And the lewd Pair to  Stygian  Sounds had sent  But unrevengeful seem'd that Punishment  A heavier Doom such black Prophaneness draws  Their taper Fingers turn to crooked Paws  No more their Necks the Smoothness can retain  Now cover'd sudden with a yellow Mane  Arms change to Legs Each finds the hard'ning Breast  Of Rage unknown and wond'rous Strength possest  Their alter'd Looks with Fury grim appear  And on the Ground their brushing Tails they hear  They haunt the Woods Their Voices which before  Were musically sweet now hoarsly roar  Hence Lions dreadful to the lab'ring Swains  Are tam'd by  Cybelé  and curb'd with Reins  And humbly draw her Car along the Plains  But thou  Adonis  my delightful Care  Of these and Beasts as fierce as these beware  The Savage which not shuns thee timely

manly Heart  And pierc'd the Savage with a sidelong Dart  The flying Savage wounded turn'd again  Wrench'd out the gory Dart and foam'd with Pain  The trembling Boy by Flight his Safety sought  And

his beauteous Prey  Fair  Cytherëa    Cyprus  scarce in view  Hear'd from afar his Groans and own'd them true  And turn'd her snowy Swans and backward flew  But as she saw him gasp his latest Breath  And quiv'ring agonize in Pangs of Death  Down with swift Flight she plung'd nor Rage forbore  At once her Garments and her Hair she tore  With cruel Blows she beat her guiltless Breast  The Fates upbraided and her Love confest  Nor shall they yet she cry'd the Whole devour  With uncontroul'd inexorable Pow'r  For thee lost Youth my Tears and restless Pain  Shall in immortal Monuments remain  With solemn Pomp in annual Rites return'd  Be thou for ever my  Adonis  mourn'd  Could  Pluto  's Queen with jealous Fury storm  And  Menthé  to a fragrant Herb transform  Yet dares not  Venus  with a

by Mr DRYDEN and Others  The Death of ORPHEUS  By Mr CROXALL  _HERE while the  Thracian  Bard's enchanting Strain  Sooths Beasts and Woods and all the list'ning Plain  The Female  Bacchanals  devoutly mad  In shaggy Skins like savage Creatures clad  Warbling in Air perceiv'd his lovely Lay  And from a rising Ground beheld him play  When one the wildest with dishevel'd Hair  That loosely stream'd and ruffled in the Air  Soon as her frantick Eye the Lyrist spy'd  See see the Hater of our Sex she cry'd  Then at his Face her missive Javelin sent  Which whiz'd along and brusht him as it went  But the soft Wreaths of Ivy twisted round  Prevent a deep Impression of the Wound  Another for a Weapon hurls a Stone  Which by the Sound subdu'd as soon as thrown  Falls at his Feet and with a seeming Sense  Implores his Pardon for its late Offence  But now their frantick Rage unbounded grows  Turns all to Madness and no Measure knows  Yet this the Charms of Musick might subdue  But that with all its Charms is conquer'd too  In louder Strains their hideous Yellings rise  And squeaking Hornpipes eccho thro' the Skies  Which in hoarse Consort with the Drum confound  The moving Lyre and ev'ry gentle Sound  Then 'twas the deafen'd Stones flew on with Speed  And saw unsooth'd their tuneful Poet bleed  The Birds the Beasts and all the Savage Crew  Which the sweet Lyrist to Attention drew  Now by the Female Mob's more furious Rage  Are driv'n and forc'd to quit the shady Stage  Next their fierce Hands the Bard himself assail  Nor can his Song against their Wrath prevail  They flock like Birds when in a clustring Flight  By Day they chase the boding Fowl of Night  So crowded Amphitheatres survey  The Stag to greedy Dogs a future Prey  Their steely Javelins which soft Curls entwine  Of budding Tendrils from the leafy Vine  For sacred Rites of mild Religion made  Are flung promiscuous at the Poet's Head  Those Clods of Earth or Flints discharge and These  Hurl prickly Branches sliver'd from the Trees  And lest their Passion shou'd be unsupply'd  The rabble Crew by chance at Distance spy'd  Where Oxen straining at the heavy Yoke  The fallow'd Field with slow Advances broke  Nigh which the brawny Peasants dug the Soil  Procuring Food with long laborious Toil  These when they saw the ranting Throng draw near  Quitted their Tools and fled possest with Fear  Long Spades and Rakes of mighty Size were found  Carelesly left upon the broken Ground  With these the furious Lunaticks engage  And first the lab'ring Oxen feel their Rage  Then to the Poet they return with Speed  Whose Fate was past Prevention now decreed  In vain he lifts his suppliant Hands in vain  He tries before his neverfailing Strain  And from those sacred Lips whose thrilling Sound  Fierce Tigers and insensate Rocks cou'd wound  Ah Gods how moving was the mournful Sight  To see the fleeting Soul now take its Flight  Thee the soft Warblers of the feather'd Kind  Bewail'd for Thee thy savage Audience pin'd  Those Rocks and Woods that oft thy Strain had led  Mourn for their Charmer and lament him dead  And drooping Trees their leafy Glories shed  Näids  and  Dryads  with dishevel'd Hair  Promiscuous weep and Scarfs of Sable wear  Nor cou'd the RiverGods conceal their Moan  But with new Floods of Tears augment their own  His mangled Limbs lay scatter'd all around  His Head and Harp a better Fortune found  In  Hebrus  ' Streams they gently roul'd along  And sooth'd the Waters with a mournful Song  Soft deadly Notes the lifeless Tongue inspire  A doleful Tune sounds from the floating Lyre  The hollow Banks in solemn Consort mourn  And the sad Strain in ecchoing Groans return  Now with the Current to the Sea they glide  Born by the Billows of the briny Tide  And driv'n where Waves round rocky  Lesbos  roar  They strand and lodge upon  Methymna  's Shore  But here when landed on the foreign Soil  A venom'd Snake the Product of the Isle  Attempts the Head and sacred Locks embru'd  With clotted Gore and still freshdropping Blood  Phoebus  at last his kind Protection gives  And from the Fact the greedy Monster drives  Whose marbled Jaws his impious Crime atone  Still grinning ghastly tho' transform'd to Stone  His Ghost flies downward to the  Stygian  Shore  And knows the Places it had seen before  Among the Shadows of the pious Train  He finds  Euridicè  and loves again  With Pleasure views the beauteous Phantom's Charms  And clasps her in his unsubstantial Arms  There Side by Side they unmolested walk  Or pass their blissful Hours in pleasing Talk  Aft or before the Bard securely goes  And without Danger can review his Spouse  The THRACIAN Women transform'd to Trees  Bacchus  resolving to revenge the Wrong  Of  Orpheus  murder'd on the madding Throng  Decreed that each Accomplice Dame should stand  Fix'd by the Roots along the conscious Land  Their wicked Feet that late so nimbly ran  To wreak their Malice on the guiltless Man  Sudden with twisted Ligatures were bound  Like Trees deep planted in the turfy Ground  And as the Fowler with his subtle Gins  His feather'd Captives by the Feet entwines  That flutt'ring pant and struggle to get loose  Yet only closer draw the fatal Noose  So these were caught and as they strove in vain  To quit the Place they but increas'd their Pain  They flounce and toil yet find themselves controul'd  The Root tho' pliant toughly keeps its Hold  In vain their Toes and Feet they look to find  For ev'n their shapely Legs are cloath'd with Rind  One smites her Thighs with a lamenting Stroke  And finds the Flesh transform'd to solid Oak  Another with Surprize and Grief distrest  Lays on above but beats a wooden Breast  A rugged Bark their softer Neck invades  Their branching Arms shoot up delightful Shades  At once they seem and are a real Grove  With mossy Trunks below and verdant Leaves above  The Fable of MIDAS  Nor this suffic'd the God's Disgust remains  And he resolves to quit their hated Plains  The Vineyards of  Tymole  ingross his Care  And with a better Choir he fixes there  Where the smooth Streams of clear  Pactolus  roll'd  Then undistinguish'd for its Sands of Gold  The Satyrs with the Nymphs his usual Throng  Come to salute their God and jovial danc'd along  Silenus  only miss'd for while he reel'd  Feeble with Age and Wine about the Field  The hoary Drunkard had forgot his Way  And to the  Phrygian  Clowns became a Prey  Who to King  Midas  drag the Captive God  While on his totty Pate the Wreaths of Ivy nod  Midas  from  Orpheus  had been taught his Lore  And knew the Rites of  Bacchus  long before  He when he saw his venerable Guest  In Honour of the God ordain'd a Feast  Ten Days in Course with each continu'd Night  Were spent in genial Mirth and brisk Delight  Then on th' Eleventh when with brighter Ray  Phosphor  had chac'd the fading Stars away  The King thro'  Lydia  's Fields young  Bacchus  sought  And to the God his Foster Father brought  Pleas'd with the welcome Sight he bids him soon  But name his Wish and swears to grant the Boon  A glorious Offer yet but ill bestow'd  On him whose Choice so little Judgment show'd  Give me says he nor thought he ask'd too much  That with my Body whatsoe'er I touch  Chang'd from the Nature which it held of old  May be converted into yellow Gold  He had his Wish but yet the God repin'd  To think the Fool no better Wish could find  But the brave King departed from the Place  With Smiles of Gladness sparkling in his Face  Nor could contain but as he took his Way  Impatient longs to make the first Essay  Down from a lowly Branch a Twig he drew  The Twig strait glitter'd with a golden Hue  He takes a Stone the Stone was turn'd to Gold  A Clod he touches and the crumbling Mold  Acknowledg'd soon the great transforming Pow'r  In Weight and Substance like a Mass of Ore  He pluck'd the Corn and strait his Grasp appears  Fill'd with a bending Tuft of Golden Ears  An Apple next he takes and seems to hold  The bright  Hesperian  vegetable Gold  His Hand he careless on a Pillar lays  With shining Gold the fluted Pillars blaze  And while he washes as the Servants pour  His Touch converts the Stream to  Danae  's Show'r  To see these Miracles so finely wrought  Fires with transporting Joy his giddy Thought  The ready Slaves prepare a sumptuous Board  Spread with rich Dainties for their happy Lord  Whose pow'rful Hands the Bread no sooner hold  But its whole Substance is transform'd to Gold  Up to his Mouth he lifts the sav'ry Meat  Which turns to Gold as he attempts to eat  His Patron's noble Juice of purple Hue  Touch'd by his Lips a gilded Cordial grew  Unfit for Drink and wondrous to behold  It trickles from his Jaws a fluid Gold  The rich poor Fool confounded with Surprize  Starving in all his various Plenty lies  Sick of his Wish he now detests the Pow'r  For which he ask'd so earnestly before  Amidst his Gold with pinching Famine curst  And justly tortur'd with an equal Thirst  At last his shining Arms to Heav'n he rears  And in Distress for Refuge flies to Pray'rs  O Father  Bacchus  I have sinn'd he cry'd  And foolishly thy gracious Gift apply'd  Thy Pity now repenting I implore  Oh may I feel the golden Plague no more  The hungry Wretch his Folly thus confest  Touch'd the kind Deity's goodnatur'd Breast  The gentle God annull'd his first Decree  And from the cruel Compact set him free  But then to cleanse him quite from further Harm  And to dilute the Relicks of the Charm  He bids him seek the Stream that cuts the Land  Nigh where the Tow'rs of  Lydian Sardis  stand  Then trace the River to the Fountain Head  And meet it rising from its rocky Bed  There as the bubling Tide pours forth amain  To plunge his Body in and wash away the Stain  The King instructed to the Fount retires  But with the golden Charm the Stream inspires  For while this Quality the Man forsakes  An equal Pow'r the limpid Water takes  Informs with Veins of Gold the neighb'ring Land  And glides along a Bed of golden Sand  Now loathing Wealth th' Occasion of his Woes  Far in the Woods he sought a calm Repose  In Caves and Grottos where the Nymphs resort  And keep with Mountain  Pan  their Silvan Court  Ah had he left his stupid Soul behind  But his Condition alter'd not his Mind  For where high  Tmolus  rears his shady Brow  And from his Cliffs surveys the Seas below  In his Descent by  Sardis  bounded here  By the small Confines of  Hypaepae  there  Pan  to the Nymphs his frolick Ditties play'd  Tuning his Reeds beneath the chequer'd Shade  The Nymphs are pleas'd the boasting Sylvan plays  And speaks with Slight of great  Apollo  's Lays  Tmolus  was Arbiter the Boaster still  Accepts the Tryal with unequal Skill  The venerable Judge was seated high  On his own Hill that seem'd to touch the Sky  Above the whisp'ring Trees his Head he rears  From their encumbring Boughs to free his Ears  A Wreath of Oak alone his Temples bound  The pendant Acorns loosely dangled round  In me your Judge says he there's no Delay  Then bids the Goatherd God begin and play  Pan  tun'd the Pipe and with his rural Song  Pleas'd the low Taste of all the vulgar Throng  Such Songs a vulgar Judgment mostly please  Midas  was there and  Midas  judg'd with these  The Mountain Sire with grave Deportment now  To  Phoebus  turns his venerable Brow  And as he turns with him the listning Wood  In the same Posture of Attention stood  The God his own  Parnassian  Laurel crown'd  And in a Wreath his golden Tresses bound  Graceful his purple Mantle swept the Ground  High on the Left his Iv'ry Lute he rais'd  The Lute emboss'd with glitt'ring Jewels blaz'd  In his right Hand he nicely held the Quill  His easy Posture spoke a Master's Skill  The Strings he touch'd with more than human Art  Which pleas'd the Judge's Ear and sooth'd his Heart  Who soon judiciously the Palm decreed  And to the Lute postpon'd the squeaking Reed  All with Applause the rightful Sentence heard  Midas  alone dissatisfy'd appear'd  To him unjustly giv'n the Judgment seems  For  Pan  's barbarick Notes he most esteems  The Lyrick God who thought his untun'd Ear  Deserv'd but ill a human Form to wear  Of that deprives him and supplies the Place  With some more fit and of an ampler Space  Fix'd on his Noddle an unseemly Pair  Flagging and large and full of whitish Hair  Without a total Change from what he was  Still in the Man preserve the simple Ass  He to conceal the Scandal of the Deed  A purple Turbant folds about his Head  Veils the Reproach from publick View and fears  The laughing World would spy his monstrous Ears  One trusty BarberSlave that us'd to dress  His Master's Hair when lengthen'd to Excess  The mighty Secret knew but knew alone  And tho' impatient durst not make it known  Restless at last a private Place he found  Then dug a Hole and told it to the Ground  In a low Whisper he reveal'd the Case  And cover'd in the Earth and silent left the Place  In Time of trembling Reeds a plenteous Crop  From the confided Furrow sprouted up  Which high advancing with the ripening Year  Made known the Tiller and his fruitless Care  For then the rustling Blades and whisp'ring Wind  To tell th' important Secret both combin'd  The Building of TROY  Phoebus  with full Revenge from  Tmolus  flies  Darts thro' the Air and cleaves the liquid Skies  Near  Hellespont  he lights and treads the Plains  Where great  Laomedon  sole Monarch reigns  Where built between the two projecting Strands  To  Panomphaean Jove  an Altar stands  Here first aspiring Thoughts the King employ  To found the lofty Tow'rs of future  Troy  The Work from Schemes magnificent begun  At vast Expence was slowly carry'd on  Which  Phoebus  seeing with the Trident God  Who rules the swelling Surges with his Nod  Assuming each a mortal Shape combine  At a set Price to finish his Design  The Work was built the King their Price denies  And his Injustice backs with Perjuries  This  Neptune  cou'd not brook but drove the Main  A mighty Deluge o'er the  Phrygian  Plain  'Twas all a Sea the Waters of the Deep  From ev'ry Vale the copious Harvest sweep  The briny Billows overflow the Soil  Ravage the Fields and mock the Plowman's Toil  Nor this appeas'd the God's revengeful Mind  For still a greater Plague remains behind  A huge SeaMonster lodges on the Sands  And the King's Daughter for his Prey demands  To him that sav'd the Damsel was decreed  A Set of Horses of the Sun's fine Breed  But when  Alcides  from the Rock unty'd  The trembling Fair the Ransom

Son you'll have the Terror of the Field  To whom in Fame and Pow'r his Sire shall yield  Jove  who ador'd the Nymph with boundless Love  Did from his Breast the dangerous Flame remove  He knew the Fates nor car'd to raise up One  Whose Fame and Greatness should eclipse his own  On happy  Peleus  he bestow'd her Charms  And bless'd his Grandson in the Goddess' Arms  A silent Creek  Thessalia  's Coast can show  Two Arms project and shape it like a Bow  'Twould make a Bay but the transparent Tide  Does scarce the yellowgravell'd Bottom hide  For the quick Eye may thro' the liquid Wave  A firm unweedy level Beach perceive  A Grove of fragrant Myrtle near it grows  Whose Boughs tho' thick a beauteous Grot disclose  The wellwrought Fabrick to discerning Eyes  Rather by Art than Nature seems to rise  A bridled Dolphin oft fair  Thetis  bore  To this her lov'd Retreat her fav'rite Shore  Here  Peleus  seiz'd her slumbring while she lay  And urg'd his Suit with all that Love could say  But when he found her obstinately coy  Resolv'd to force her and command the Joy  The Nymph o'erpower'd to Art for Succour flies  And various Shapes the eager Youth surprize  A Bird she seems but plies her Wings in vain  His Hands the fleeting Substance still detain  A branchy Tree high in the Air she grew  About its Bark his nimble Arms he threw  A Tyger next she glares with flaming Eyes  The frighten'd Lover quits his Hold and flies  The SeaGods he with sacred Rites adores  Then a Libation on the Ocean pours  While the fat Entrails crackle in the Fire  And Sheets of Smoak in sweet Perfume aspire  Till  Proteus  rising from his oozy Bed  Thus to the poor desponding Lover said  No more in anxious Thoughts your Mind employ  For yet you shall possess the dear expected Joy  You must once more th' unwary Nymph surprize  As in her cooly Grot she slumbring lies  Then bind her fast with unrelenting Hands  And strain her tender Limbs with knotted Bands  Still hold her under ev'ry different Shape  Till tir'd she tries no longer to escape  Thus he Then sunk beneath the glassy Flood  And broken Accents flutter'd where he stood  Bright  Sol  had almost now his Journey done  And down the steepy western Convex run  When the fair  Nereid  left the briny Wave  And as she us'd retreated to her Cave  He scarce had bound her fast when she arose  And into various Shapes her Body throws  She

With Sorrow wild I ran to her Relief  And try'd to moderate my Brother's Grief  He deaf as Rocks by stormy Surges beat  Loudly laments and hears me not intreat  When on the Fun'ral Pile he saw her

warn'd to shun the watry Way  The Face is frightful of the stormy Sea  For late I saw adrift disjointed Planks  And empty Tombs erected on the Banks  Nor let false Hopes to Trust betray thy Mind  Because my Sire in Caves constrains the Wind  Can with a Breath their clam'rous Rage appease  They fear his Whistle and forsake the Seas  Not so for once indulg'd they sweep the Main  Deaf to the Call or hearing hear in vain  But bent on Mischief bear the Waves before  And not content with Seas insult the Shore  When Ocean Air and Earth at once ingage  And rooted Forests fly before their Rage  At once the clashing Clouds to Battle move  And Lightnings run across the Fields above  I know them well and mark'd their rude Comport  While yet a Child within my Father's Court  In times of Tempest they command alone  And he but sits precarious on the Throne  The more I know the more my Fears augment  And Fears are oft prophetick of th' Event  But if not Fears or Reasons will prevail  If Fate has fix'd thee obstinate to sail  Go not without thy Wife but let me bear  My Part of Danger with an equal Share  And present what I suffer only fear  Then o'er the bounding Billows shall we fly  Secure to live together or to die  These Reasons mov'd her starlike Husband's Heart  But still he held his Purpose to depart  For as he lov'd her equal to his Life  He would not to the Seas expose his Wife  Nor could be wrought his Voyage to refrain  But sought by Arguments to sooth her Pain  Nor these avail'd at length he lights on one  With which so difficult a Cause he won  My Love so short an Absence cease to fear  For by my Father's holy Flame I swear  Before two Moons their Orb with Light adorn  If Heav'n allow me Life I will return  This Promise of so short a Stay prevails  He soon equips the Ship supplies the Sails  And gives the Word to launch she trembling views  This Pomp of Death and parting Tears renews  Last with a Kiss she took a long Farewel  Sigh'd with a sad Presage and swooning fell  While  Ceyx  seeks Delays the lusty Crew  Rais'd on their Banks their Oars in order drew  To their broad Breasts the Ship with Fury flew  The Queen recover'd rears her humid Eyes  And first her Husband on the Poop espies  Shaking his Hand at Distance on the Main  She took the Sign and shook her Hand again  Still as the Ground recedes contracts her View  With sharpen'd Sight till she no longer knew  The muchlov'd Face that Comfort lost supplies  With less and with the Galley feeds her Eyes  The Galley born from View by rising Gales  She follow'd with her Sight the flying Sails  When ev'n the flying Sails were seen no more  Forsaken of all Sight she left the Shoar  Then on her BridalBed her Body throws  And sought in Sleep her weary'd Eyes to close  Her Husband's Pillow and the widow'd part  Which once he press'd renew'd the former Smart  And now a Breeze from Shoar began to blow  The Sailors ship their Oars and cease to row  Then hoist their Yards atrip and all their Sails  Let fall to court the Wind and catch the Gales  By this the Vessel half her Course had run  And as much rested till the rising Sun  Both Shoars were lost to Sight when at the Close  Of Day a stiffer Gale at East arose  The Sea grew white the rowling Waves from far  Like Heralds first denounce the wat'ry War  This seen the Master soon began to cry  Strike strike the Topsail let the Mainsheet fly  And furl your Sails The Winds repel the Sound  And in the Speaker's Mouth the Speech is drown'd  Yet of their own Accord as Danger taught  Each in his Way officiously they wrought  Some stow their Oars or stop the leaky Sides  Another bolder yet the Yard bestrides  And folds the Sails a fourth with Labour laves  Th' intruding Seas and Waves ejects on Waves  In this Confusion while their Work they ply  The Winds augment the Winter of the Sky  And wage intestine Wars the suff'ring Seas  Are toss'd and mingled as their Tyrants please  The Master would command but in despair  Of Safety stands amaz'd with stupid Care  Nor what to bid or what forbid he knows  Th' ungovern'd Tempest to such Fury grows  Vain is his Force and vainer is his Skill  With such a Concourse comes the Flood of Ill  The Cries of Men are mix'd with rattling Shrowds  Seas dash on Seas and Clouds encounter Clouds  At once from East to West from Pole to Pole  The forky Lightnings flash the roaring Thunders roul  Now Waves on Waves ascending scale the Skies  And in the Fires above the Water fries  When yellow Sands are sifted from below  The glitt'ring Billows give a golden Show  And when the fouler Bottom spews the Black  The  Stygian  Dye the tainted Waters take  Then frothy White appear the flatted Seas  And change their Colour changing their Disease  Like various Fits the  Trachin  Vessel finds  And now sublime she rides upon the Winds  As from a lofty Summit looks from high  And from the Clouds beholds the neather Sky  Now from the Depth of Hell they lift their Sight  And at a Distance see superior Light  The lashing Billows make a loud Report  And beat her Sides as batt'ring Rams a Fort  Or as a Lyon bounding in his way  With Force augmented bears against his Prey  Sidelong to seize or unapal'd with Fear  Springs on the Toils and rushes on the Spear  So Seas impell'd by Winds with added Pow'r  Assault the Sides and o'er the Hatches tow'r  The Planks their pitchy Cov'ring wash'd away  Now yield and now a yawning Breach display  The roaring Waters with a hostile Tide  Rush through the Ruins of her gaping Side  Mean time in Sheets of Rain the Sky descends  And Ocean swell'd with Waters upwards tends  One rising falling one the Heav'ns and Sea  Meet at their Confines in the middle Way  The Sails are drunk with Show'rs and drop with Rain  Sweet Waters mingle with the briny Main  No Star appears to lend his friendly Light  Darkness and Tempest make a double Night  But flashing Fires disclose the Deep by turns  And while the Light'nings blaze the Water burns  Now all the Waves their scatter'd Force unite  And as a Soldier foremost in the Fight  Makes way for others and an Host alone  Still presses on and urging gains the Town  So while th' invading Billows come abreast  The Hero Tenth advanc'd before the rest  Sweeps all before him with impetuous Sway  And from the Walls descends upon the Prey  Part following enter Part remain without  With Envy hear their Fellows conqu'ring Shout  And mount on others Backs in hope to share  The City thus become the Seat of War  An universal Cry resounds aloud  The Sailors run in Heaps a helpless Crowd  Art fails and Courage falls no Succour near  As many Waves as many Deaths appear  One weeps and yet despairs of late Relief  One cannot weep his Fears congeal his Grief  But stupid with dry Eyes expects his Fate  One with loud Shrieks laments his lost Estate  And calls those happy whom their Fun'rals wait  This Wretch with Pray'rs and Vows the Gods implores  And ev'n the Skies he cannot see adores  That other on his Friends his Thoughts bestows  His careful Father and his faithful Spouse  The covetous Wordling in his anxious Mind  Thinks only on the Wealth he left behind  All  Ceyx  his  Alcyone  employs  For her he grieves yet in her Absence joys  His Wife he wishes and would still be near  Not her with him but wishes him with her  Now with last Looks he seeks his native Shoar  Which Fate has destin'd him to see no more  He sought but in the dark tempestuous Night  He knew not whither to direct his Sight  So whirl the Seas such Darkness blinds the Sky  That the black Night receives a deeper Dye  The giddy Ship ran round the Tempest tore  Her Mast and overboard the Rudder bore  One Billow mounts and with a scornful Brow  Proud of her Conquest gain'd insults the Waves below  Nor lighter falls than if some Giant tore  Pindus  and  Athos  with the Freight they bore  And toss'd on Seas press'd with the pond'rous Blow  Down sinks the Ship within th' Abyss below  Down with the Vessel sink into the Main  The many never more to rise again  Some few on scatter'd Planks with fruitless Care  Lay hold and swim but while they swim despair  Ev'n he who late a Scepter did command  Now grasps a floating Fragment in his Hand  And while he struggles on the stormy Main  Invokes his Father and his Wife's in vain  But yet his Consort is his greatest Care  Alcyone  he names amidst his Pray'r  Names as a Charm against the Waves and Wind  Most in his Mouth and ever in his Mind  Tir'd with his Toil all Hopes of Safety past  From Pray'rs to Wishes he descends at last  That his dead Body wafted to the Sands  Might have its Burial from her friendly Hands  As oft as he can catch a Gulp of Air  And peep above the Seas he names the Fair  And ev'n when plung'd beneath on her he raves  Murm'ring  Alcyone  below the Waves  At last a falling Billow stops his Breath  Breaks o'er his Head and whelms him underneath  Bright  Lucifer  unlike himself appears  That Night his heav'nly Form obscur'd with Tears  And since he was forbid to leave the Skies  He muffled with a Cloud his mournful Eyes  Mean time  Alcyonè  his Fate unknown  Computes how many Nights he had been gone  Observes the waning Moon with hourly View  Numbers her Age and wishes for a new  Against the promis'd Time provides with Care  And hastens in the Woof the Robes he was to wear  And for her Self employs another Loom  Newdress'd to meet her Lord returning home  Flatt'ring her Heart with Joys that never were to come  She fum'd the Temples with an od'rous Flame  And oft before the sacred Altars came  To pray for him who was an empty Name  All Pow'rs implor'd but far above the rest  To  Juno  she her pious Vows address'd  Her muchlov'd Lord from Perils to protect  And safe o'er Seas his Voyage to direct  Then pray'd that she might still possess his Heart  And no pretending Rival share a Part  This last Petition heard of all her Pray'r  The rest dispers'd by Winds were lost in Air  But she the Goddess of the Nuptial Bed  Tir'd with her vain Devotions for the Dead  Resolv'd the tainted Hand should be repell'd  Which Incense offer'd and her Altar held  Then  Iris  thus bespoke Thou faithful Maid  By whom thy Queen's Commands are well convey'd  Haste to the House of Sleep and bid the God  Who rules the Night by Visions with a Nod  Prepare a Dream in Figure and in Form  Resembling him who perish'd in the Storm  This Form before  Alcyonè  present  To make her certain of the sad Event  Indu'd with Robes of various Hue she flies  And flying draws an Arch a Segment of the Skies  Then leaves her bending Bow and from the Steep  Descends to search the silent House of Sleep  The House of SLEEP  Near the  Cymmerians  in his dark Abode  Deep in a Cavern dwells the drowzy God  Whose gloomy Mansion nor the rising Sun  Nor setting visits nor the lightsome Noon  But lazy Vapours round the Region fly  Perpetual Twilight and a doubtful Sky  No crowing Cock does there his Wings display  Nor with his horny Bill provoke the Day  Nor watchful Dogs nor the more wakeful Geese  Disturb with nightly Noise the sacred Peace  Nor Beast of Nature nor the Tame are nigh  Nor Trees with Tempests rock'd nor human Cry  But safe Repose without an Air of Breath  Dwells here and a dumb Quiet next to Death  An Arm of  Lethè  with a gentle Flow  Arising upwards from the Rock below  The Palace moats and o'er the Pebbles creeps  And with soft Murmurs calls the coming Sleeps  Around its Entry nodding Poppies grow  And all cool Simples that sweet Rest bestow  Night from the Plants their sleepy Virtue drains  And passing sheds it on the silent Plains  No Door there was th' unguarded House to keep  On creaking Hinges turn'd to break his Sleep  But in the gloomy Court was rais'd a Bed  Stuff'd with black Plumes and on an Ebonsted  Black was the Cov'ring too where lay the God  And slept supine his Limbs display'd abroad  About his Head fantastick Visions fly  Which various Images of things supply  And mock their Forms the Leaves on Trees not more  Nor bearded Ears in Fields nor Sands upon the Shore  The Virgin ent'ring bright indulg'd the Day  To the brown Cave and brush'd the Dreams away  The God disturb'd with this new Glare of Light  Cast sudden on his Face unseal'd his Sight  And rais'd his tardy Head which sunk again  And sinking on his Bosom knock'd his Chin  At length shook off himself and ask'd the Dame  And asking yawn'd for what Intent she came  To whom the Goddess thus O sacred Rest  Sweet pleasing Sleep of all the Pow'rs the best  O Peace of Mind Repairer of Decay  Whose Balms renew the Limbs to Labours of the Day  Care shuns thy soft Approach and sullen flies away  Adorn a Dream expressing human Form  The Shape of him who suffer'd in the Storm  And send it flitting to the  Trachin  Court  The Wreck of wretched  Ceyx  to report  Before his Queen bid the pale Spectre stand  Who begs a vain Relief at  Juno  's Hand  She said and scarce awake her Eyes could keep  Unable to support the Fumes of Sleep  But fled returning by the way she went  And swerv'd along her Bow with swift Ascent  The God uneasy till he slept again  Resolv'd at once to rid himself of Pain  And tho' against his Custom call'd aloud  Exciting  Morpheus  from the sleepy Crowd  Morpheus  of all his numerous Train express'd  The Shape of Man and imitated best  The Walk the Words the Gesture could supply  The Habit mimick and the Mein bely  Plays well but all his Action is confin'd  Extending not beyond our human Kind  Another Birds and Beasts and Dragons apes  And dreadful Images and Monster Shapes  This Demon  Icelos  in Heav'ns high Hall  The Gods have nam'd but Men  Phobetor  call  A third is  Phantasus  whose Actions roul  On meaner Thoughts and Things devoid of Soul  Earth Fruits and Flow'rs he represents in Dreams  And solid Rocks unmov'd and running Streams  These three to Kings and Chiefs their Scenes display  The rest before th' ignoble Commons play  Of these the chosen  Morpheus  is dispatch'd  Which done the lazy Monarch overwatch'd  Down from his propping Elbow drops his Head  Dissolv'd in Sleep and shrinks within his Bed  Darkling the Demon glides for Flight prepar'd  So soft that scarce his fanning Wings are heard  To  Trachin  swift as Thought the flitting Shade  Through Air his momentary Journey made  Then lays aside the Steerage of his Wings  Forsakes his proper Form assumes the King's  And pale as Death despoil'd of his Array  Into the Queen's Apartment takes his way  And stands before the Bed at Dawn of Day  Unmov'd his Eyes and wet his Beard appears  And shedding vain but seeming real Tears  The briny Water dropping from his Hairs  Then staring on her with a ghastly Look  And hollow Voice he thus the Queen bespoke  Know'st thou not me Not yet unhappy Wife  Or are my Features perish'd with my Life  Look once again and for thy Husband lost  Lo all that's left of him thy Husband's Ghost  Thy Vows for my Return were all in vain  The stormy South o'ertook us in the Main  And never shalt thou see thy living Lord again  Bear witness Heav'n I call'd on thee in Death  And while I call'd a Billow stopp'd my Breath  Think not that flying Fame reports my Fate  I present I appear and my own Wreck relate  Rise wretched Widow rise nor undeplor'd  Permit my Soul to pass the  Stygian  Ford  But rise prepar'd in Black to mourn thy perish'd Lord  Thus said the PlayerGod and adding Art  Of Voice and Gesture so perform'd his Part  She thought so like her Love the Shade appears  That  Ceyx  spake the Words and  Ceyx  shed the Tears  She groan'd her inward Soul with Grief opprest  She sigh'd she wept and sleeping beat her Breast  Then stretch'd her Arms t' embrace his Body bare  Her clasping Arms inclose but empty Air  At this not yet awake she cry'd O stay  One is our Fate and common is our Way  So dreadful was the Dream so loud she spoke  That starting sudden up the Slumber broke  Then cast her Eyes around in hope to view  Her vanish'd Lord and find the Vision true  For now the Maids who waited her Commands  Ran in with lighted Tapers in their Hands  Tir'd with the Search not finding what she seeks  With cruel Blows she pounds her blubber'd Cheeks  Then from her beaten Breast the Linnen tare  And cut the golden Caul that bound her Hair  Her Nurse demands the Cause with louder Cries  She prosecutes her Griefs and thus replies  No more  Alcyonè  she suffer'd Death  With her lov'd Lord when  Ceyx  lost his Breath  No Flatt'ry no false Comfort give me none  My shipwreck'd  Ceyx  is for ever gone  I saw I saw him manifest in View  His Voice his Figure and his Gestures knew  His Lustre lost and ev'ry living Grace  Yet I retain'd the Features of his Face  Tho' with pale Cheeks wet Beard and dropping Hair  None but my  Ceyx  could appear so fair  I would have strain'd him with a strict Embrace  But thro' my Arms he slipp'd and vanish'd from the Place  There ev'n just there he stood and as she spoke  Where last the Spectre was she cast her Look  Fain wou'd she hope and gaz'd upon the Ground  If any printed Footsteps might be found  Then sigh'd and said This I too well foreknew  And my prophetick Fears presag'd too true  'Twas what I begg'd when with a bleeding Heart  I took my Leave and suffer'd thee to part  Or I to go along or Thou to stay  Never ah never to divide our Way  Happier for me that all our Hours assign'd  Together we had liv'd ev'n not in Death disjoin'd  So had my  Ceyx  still been living here  Or with my  Ceyx  I had perish'd there  Now I die absent in the vast Profound  And Me without my Self the Seas have drown'd  The Storms were not so cruel should I strive  To lengthen Life and such a Grief survive  But neither will I strive nor wretched Thee  In Death forsake but keep thee Company  If not one common Sepulcher contains  Our Bodies or one Urn our last Remains  Yet  Ceyx  and  Alcyonè  shall join  Their Names remember'd in one common Line  No farther Voice her mighty Grief affords  For Sighs come rushing in betwixt her Words  And stopp'd her Tongue but what her Tongue deny'd  Soft Tears and Groans and dumb Complaints supply'd  'Twas Morning to the Port she takes her way  And stands upon the Margin of the Sea  That Place that very Spot of Ground she sought  Or thither by her Destiny was brought  Where last he stood And while she sadly said  'Twas here he left me lingring here delay'd  His parting Kiss and there his Anchors weigh'd  Thus speaking while her Thoughts past Actions trace  And call to mind admonish'd by the Place  Sharp at her utmost Ken she cast her Eyes  And somewhat floating from afar descries  It seem'd a Corps adrift to distant Sight  But at a Distance who could judge aright  It wafted nearer yet and then she knew  That what before she but surmis'd was true  A Corps it was but whose it was unknown  Yet mov'd howe'er she made the Case her own  Took the bad Omen of a shipwreck'd Man  As for a Stranger wept and thus began  Poor Wretch on stormy Seas to lose thy Life  Unhappy thou but more thy widow'd Wife  At this she paus'd for now the flowing Tide  Had brought the Body nearer to the Side  The more she looks the more her Fears increase  At nearer Sight and she's her self the less  Now driv'n ashore and at her Feet it lies  She knows too much in knowing whom she sees  Her Husband's Corps at this she loudly shrieks  'Tis he 'tis he she cries and tears her Cheeks  Her Hair and Vest and stooping to the Sands  About his Neck she cast her trembling Hands  And is it thus O dearer than my Life  Thus thus return'st Thou to thy longing Wife  She said and to the neighb'ring Mole she strode  Rais'd there to break th'Incursions of the Flood  Headlong from hence to plunge her self she springs  But shoots along supported on her Wings  A Bird newmade about the Banks she plies  Not far from Shore and short Excursions tries  Nor seeks in Air her humble Flight to raise  Content to skim the Surface of the Seas  Her Bill tho' slender sends a creaking Noise  And imitates a lamentable Voice  Now lighting where the bloodless Body lies  She with a Fun'ral Note renews her Cries  At all her Stretch her little Wings she spread  And with her feather'd Arms embrac'd the Dead  Then flick'ring to his palid Lips she strove  To print a Kiss the last Essay of Love  Whether the vital Touch reviv'd the Dead  Or that the moving Waters rais'd his Head  To meet the Kiss the Vulgar doubt alone  For sure a present Miracle was shown  The Gods their Shapes to WinterBirds translate  But both obnoxious to their former Fate  Their conjugal Affection still is ty'd  And still the mournful Race is multiply'd  They bill they tread  Alcyonè  compress'd  Sev'n Days sits brooding on her floating Nest  A wintry Queen Her Sire at length is kind  Calms

Sounds and multiply the News  Where Eccho's in repeated Eccho's play  A Mart for ever full and open Night and Day  Nor Silence is within nor Voice express  But a deaf Noise of Sounds that never cease  Confus'd and chiding like the hollow Roar  Of Tides receding from th' insulted Shore  Or like the broken Thunder heard from far  When  Jove  to distance drives the rowling War  The Courts are fill'd with a tumultuous Din  Of Crowds or issuing forth or entring in  A thoroughfare of News Where some devise  Things never heard some mingle Truth with Lies  The troubled Air with empty Sounds they beat  Intent to hear and eager to repeat  Error sits brooding there with added Train  Of vain Credulity and Joys as vain  Suspicion with Sedition join'd are near  And Rumors rais'd and Murmurs mix'd and Panique Fear  Fame  sits aloft and sees the subject Ground  And Seas about and Skies above enquiring all around  The Goddess gives th' Alarm and soon is known  The  Grecian  Fleet descending on the Town  Fix'd on Defence the  Trojans  are not slow  To guard their Shore from an expected Foe  They meet in Fight By  Hector  's fatal Hand  Protesilaus  falls and bites the Strand  Which with Expence of Blood the  Grecians  won  And prov'd the Strength unknown of  Priam  's Son  And to their Cost the  Trojan  Leaders felt  The  Grecian  Heroes and what Deaths they dealt  The Story of CYGNUS  From these first Onsets the  Sigaean  Shore  Was strew'd with Carcasses and stain'd with Gore  Neptunian Cygnus  Troops of  Greeks  had slain  Achilles  in his Carr had scour'd the Plain  And clear'd the  Trojan  Ranks Wheree'er he fought  Cygnus  or  Hector  through the Fields he sought  Cygnus  he found on him his Force essay'd  For  Hector  was to the tenth Year delay'd  His white man'd Steeds that bow'd beneath the Yoke  He chear'd to Courage with a gentle Stroke  Then urg'd his fiery Chariot on the Foe  And rising shook his Lance in act to throw  But first he cry'd O Youth be proud to bear  Thy Death ennobled by  Pelides  ' Spear  The Lance pursu'd the Voice without delay  Nor did the whizzing Weapon miss the way  But pierc'd his Cuirass with such Fury sent  And sign'd his Bosom with a Purple Dint  At this the Seed of  Neptune  Goddessborn  For Ornament not Use these Arms are worn  This Helm and heavy Buckler I can spare  As only Decorations of the War  So  Mars  is arm'd for Glory not for Need  'Tis somewhat more from  Neptune  to proceed  Than from a Daughter of the Sea to spring  Thy Sire is Mortal mine is Ocean's King  Secure of Death I shou'd contemn thy Dart  Tho' naked and impassible depart  He said and threw The trembling Weapon pass'd  Through nine Bullhides each under other plac'd  On his broad Shield and stuck within the last  Achilles  wrench'd it out and sent again  The hostile Gift The hostile Gift was vain  He try'd a third a tough wellchosen Spear  Th' inviolable Body stood sincere  Though  Cygnus  then did no Defence provide  But scornful offer'd his unshielded Side  Not otherwise th'impatient Hero far'd  Than as a Bull incompass'd with a Guard  Amid the  Circus  roars provok'd from far  By sight of Scarlet and a sanguine War  They quit their Ground his bended Horns elude  In vain pursuing and in vain pursu'd  Before to farther Fight he wou'd advance  He stood considering and survey'd his Lance  Doubts if he wielded not a wooden Spear  Without a Point He look'd the Point was there  This is my Hand and this my Lance he said  By which so many thousand Foes are dead  O whither is their usual Virtue fled  I had it once and the  Lyrnessian  Wall  And  Tenedos  confess'd it in their Fall  Thy Streams  Caicus  rowl'd a CrimsonFlood  And  Thebes  ran red with her own Natives Blood  Twice  Telephus  employ'd their piercing Steel  To wound him first and afterward to heal  The Vigour of this Arm was never vain  And that my wonted Prowess I retain  Witness these Heaps of Slaughter on the Plain  He said and doubtful of his former Deeds  To some new Trial of his Force proceeds  He chose  Menaetes  from among the rest  At him he lanch'd his Spear and pierc'd his Breast  On the hard Earth the  Lycian  knock'd his Head  And lay supine and forth the Spirit fled  Then thus the Hero Neither can I blame  The Hand or Javelin both are still the same  The same I will employ against this Foe  And wish but with the same Success to throw  So spoke the Chief and while he spoke he threw  The Weapon with unerring Fury flew  At his left Shoulder aim'd Nor Entrance found  But back as from a Rock with swift Rebound  Harmless return'd A bloody Mark appear'd  Which with false Joy the flatter'd Hero chear'd  Wound there was none the Blood that was in view  The Lance before from slain  Menaetes  drew  Headlong he leaps from off his lofty Car  And in close Fight on Foot renews the War  Raging with high Disdain repeats his Blows  Nor Shield nor Armour can their Force oppose  Huge Cantlets of his Buckler strew the Ground  And no Defence in his bor'd Arms is found  But on his Flesh no Wound or Blood is seen  The Sword it self is blunted on the Skin  This vain Attempt the Chief no longer bears  But round his hollow Temples and his Ears  His Buckler beats The Son of  Neptune  stunn'd  With these repeated Buffets quits his Ground  A sickly Sweat succeeds and Shades of Night  Inverted Nature swims before his Sight  Th' insulting Victor presses on the more  And treads the Steps the Vanquish'd trod before  Nor Rest nor Respite gives A Stone there lay  Behind his trembling Foe and stopp'd his Way  Achilles  took th' Advantage which he found  O'erturn'd and push'd him backward on the Ground  His Buckler held him under while he press'd  With both his Knees above his panting Breast  Unlac'd his Helm About his Chin the Twist  He ty'd and soon the strangled Soul dismiss'd  With eager Haste he went to strip the Dead  The vanish'd Body from his Arms was fled  His SeaGod Sire t'immortalize his Frame  Had turn'd it to the Bird that bears his Name  A Truce succeeds the Labours of this Day  And Arms suspended with a long Delay  While  Trojan  Walls are kept with Watch and Ward  The  Greeks  before their Trenches mount the Guard  The Feast approach'd when to the blueey'd Maid  His Vows for  Cygnus  slain the Victor paid  And a white Heyfer on her Altar laid  The reeking Entrails on the Fire they threw  And to the Gods the grateful Odour flew  Heav'n had its Part in Sacrifice The rest  Was broil'd and roasted for the future Feast  The chief invited Guests were set around  And Hunger first asswag'd the Bowls were crown'd  Which in deep Draughts their Cares and Labours drown'd  The mellow Harp did not their Ears employ  And mute was all the Warlike Symphony  Discourse the Food of Souls was their Delight  And pleasing Chat prolong'd the Summersnight  The Subject Deeds of Arms and Valour shown  Or on the  Trojan  Side or on their own  Of Dangers undertaken Fame atchiev'd  They talk'd by turns the Talk by turns reliev'd  What Things but these could fierce  Achilles  tell  Or what cou'd fierce  Achilles  hear so well  The last great Act perform'd of  Cygnus  slain  Did most the Martial Audience entertain  Wondring to find a Body free by Fate  From Steel and which cou'd ev'n that Steel rebate  Amaz'd their Admiration they renew  And scarce  Pelides  cou'd believe it true  The Story of CAENEUS  Then  Nestor  thus What once this Age has known  In fated  Cygnus  and in him alone  These Eyes have seen in  Caeneus  long before  Whose Body not a thousand Swords cou'd bore  Caeneus  in Courage and in Strength excell'd  And still his  Othry's  with his Fame is fill'd  But what did most his Martial Deeds adorn  Though since he chang'd his Sex a Woman born  A Novelty so strange and full of Fate  His list'ning Audience ask'd him to relate  Achilles  thus commends their common Sute  O Father first for Prudence in Repute  Tell with that Eloquence so much thy own  What thou hast heard or what of  Caeneus  known  What was he whence his Change of Sex begun  What Trophies join'd in Wars with thee he won  Who conquer'd him and in what fatal Strife  The Youth without a Wound cou'd lose his Life  Neleides  then Though tardy Age and Time  Have shrunk my Sinews and decay'd my Prime  Though much I have forgotten of my Store  Yet not exhausted I remember more  Of all that Arms atchiev'd or Peace design'd  That Action still is fresher in my Mind  Than ought beside If reverend Age can give  To Faith a Sanction in my third I live  'Twas in my second Cent'ry I survey'd  Young  Caenis  then a fair  Thessalian  Maid  Caenis  the bright was born to high Command  A Princess and a Native of thy Land  Divine  Achilles  every Tongue proclaim'd  Her Beauty and her Eyes all Hearts inflam'd  Peleus  thy Sire perhaps had sought her Bed  Among the rest but he had either led  Thy Mother then or was by Promise ty'd  But she to him and all alike her Love deny'd  It was her Fortune once to take her Way  Along the sandy Margin of the Sea  The Pow'r of Ocean view'd her as she pass'd  And lov'd as soon as seen by Force embrac'd  So Fame reports Her VirginTreasure seiz'd  And his new Joys the Ravisher so pleas'd  That thus transported to the Nymph he cry'd  Ask what thou wilt no Pray'r shall be deny'd  This also Fame relates The haughty Fair  Who not the Rape ev'n of a God cou'd bear  This Answer proud return'd To mighty Wrongs  A mighty Recompence of right belongs  Give me no more to suffer such a Shame  But change the Woman for a better Name  One Gift for all She said and while she spoke  Aster n majestick manly Tone she took  A Man she was And as the Godhead swore  To  Caeneus  turn'd who  Caenis  was before  To this the Lover adds without Request  No force of Steel shou'd violate his Breast  Glad of the Gift the newmade Warrior goes  And Arms among the  Greeks  and longs for equal Foes  The Skirmish between the CENTAURS and LAPITHITES  Now brave  Perithous  bold  Ixion  's Son  The Love of fair  Hippodamè  had won  The Cloudbegotten Race half Men half Beast  Invited came to grace the Nuptial Feast  In a cool Cave's Recess the Treat was made  Whose Entrance Trees with spreading Boughs o'ershade  They sate And summon'd by the Bridegroom came  To mix with those the  Lapythaean  Name  Nor wanted I The Roofs with Joy resound  And  Hymen    Io Hymen  rung around  Rais'd Altars shone with holy Fires the Bride  Lovely her self and lovely by her Side  A Bevy of bright Nymphs with sober Grace  Came glitt'ring like a Star and took her Place  Her Heav'nly Form beheld all wish'd her Joy  And little wanted but in vain their Wishes all employ  For One most Brutal of the Brutal Brood  Or whether Wine or Beauty fir'd his Blood  Or both at once beheld with lustful Eyes  The Bride at once resolv'd to make his Prize  Down went the Board and fastning on her Hair  He seiz'd with sudden Force the frighted Fair  Twas  Eurytus  began His bestial Kind  His Crime pursu'd and each as pleas'd his Mind  Or her whom Chance presented took The Feast  An Image of a taken Town express'd  The Cave resounds with Female Shrieks we rise  Mad with Revenge to make a swift Reprise  And  Theseus  first What Frenzy has possess'd  O  Eurytus  he cry'd thy brutal Breast  To wrong  Perithous  and not him alone  But while I live two Friends conjoyn'd in one  To justifie his Threat he thrusts aside  The Crowd of Centaurs and redeems the Bride  The Monster nought reply'd For Words were vain  And Deeds cou'd only Deeds unjust maintain  But answers with his Hand and forward press'd  With Blows redoubled on his Face and Breast  An ample Goblet stood of antick Mold  And rough with Figures of the rising Gold  The Hero snatch'd it up and toss'd in Air  Full at the Front of the foul Ravisher  He falls and falling vomits forth a Flood  Of Wine and Foam and Brains and mingled Blood  Half roaring and half neighing through the Hall  Arms Arms the doubleform'd with Fury call  To wreak their Brother's Death A MedleyFlight  Of Bowls and Jars at first supply the Fight  Once Instruments of Feasts but now of Fate  Wine animates their Rage and arms their Hate  Bold  Amycus  from the robb'd Vestry brings  The Chalices of Heav'n and holy Things  Of precious Weight A Sconce that hung on high  With Tapers fill'd to light the Sacristy  Torn from the Cord with his unhallow'd Hand  He threw amid the  Lapythaean  Band  On  Celadon  the Ruin fell and left  His Face of Feature and of Form bereft  So when some brawny Sacrificer knocks  Before an Altar led an offer'd Ox  His Eyeballs rooted out are thrown to Ground  His Nose dismantled in his Mouth is found  His Jaws Cheeks Front one undistinguish'd Wound  This  Belates  th' Avenger cou'd not brook  But by the Foot a Mapleboard he took  And hurl'd at  Amycus  his Chin it bent  Against his Chest and down the Centaur sent  Whom sputtring bloody Teeth the second Blow  Of his drawn Sword dispatch'd to Shades below  Grineus  was near and cast a furious Look  On the SideAltar cens'd with sacred Smoke  And bright with flaming Fires The Gods he cry'd  Have with their holy Trade our Hands supply'd  Why use we not their Gifts Then from the Floor  An AltarStone he heav'd with all the Load it bore  Altar and Altar's Freight together flew  Where thickest throng'd the  Lapythaean  Crew  And at once  Broteas  and  Oryus  slew  Oryus  ' Mother  Mycalè  was known  Down from her Sphere to draw the lab'ring Moon  Exadius  cry'd unpunish'd shall not go  This Fact if Arms are found against the Foe  He look'd about where on a Pine were spread  The votive Horns of a Stag's branching Head  At  Grineus  these he throws so just they fly  That the sharp Antlers stuck in either Eye  Breathless and Blind he fell with Blood besmear'd  His Eyeballs beaten out hung dangling on his Beard  Fierce  Rhaetus  from the Hearth a burning Brand  Selects and whirling waves till from his Hand  The Fire took Flame then dash'd it from the right  On fair  Charaxus  ' Temples near the Sight  The whistling Pest came on and pierc'd the Bone  And caught the yellow Hair that shrivel'd while it shone  Caught like dry Stubble fir'd or like Seerwood  Yet from the Wound ensu'd no Purple Flood  But look'd a bubbling Mass of frying Blood  His blazing Locks sent forth a crackling Sound  And hiss'd like red hot Iron within the Smithy drown'd  The wounded Warrior shook his flaming Hair  Then what a Team of Horse cou'd hardly rear  He heaves the ThresholdStone but cou'd not throw  The Weight it self forbad the threaten'd Blow  Which dropping from his lifted Arms came down  Full on  Cometes  ' Head and crush'd his Crown  Nor  Rhaetus  then retain'd his Joy but said  So by their Fellows may our Foes be sped  Then with redoubled Strokes he plies his Head  The burning Lever not deludes his Pains  But drives the batter'd Skull within the Brains  Thus flush'd the Conqueror with Force renew'd  Evagrus    Dryas    Corythus  pursu'd  First  Corythus  with downy Cheeks he slew  Whose Fall when fierce  Evagrus  had in view  He cry'd What Palm is from a beardless Prey  Rhaetus  prevents what more he had to say  And drove within his Mouth the fiery Death  Which enter'd hissing in and choak'd his Breath  At  Dryas  next he flew But weary Chance  No longer wou'd the same Success advance  For while he whirl'd in fiery Circles round  The Brand a sharpen'd Stake strong  Dryas  found  And in the Shoulder's Joint inflicts the Wound  The Weapon stuck which roaring out with Pain  He drew nor longer durst the Fight maintain  But turn'd his Back for Fear and fled amain  With him fled  Orneus  with like Dread possess'd  Thaumas  and  Medon  wounded in the Breast  And  Mermcros  in the late Race renown'd  Now limping ran and tardy with his Wound  Pholus  and  Melaneus  from Fight withdrew  And  Abas  maim'd who Boars encountring slew  And  Augur Astylos  whose Art in vain  From Fight dissuaded the fourfooted Train  Now beat the Hoof with  Nessus  on the Plain  But to his Fellow cry'd Be safely slow  Thy Death deferr'd is due to Great  Alcides  ' Bow  Mean time strong  Dryas  urg'd his Chance so well  That  Lycidas    Areos    Imbreus  fell  All one by one and fighting Face to Face  Crenaeus  fled to fall with more Disgrace  For fearful while he look'd behind he bore  Betwixt his Nose and Front the Blow before  Amid the Noise and Tumult of the Fray  Snoring and drunk with Wine  Aphidas  lay  Ev'n then the Bowl within his Hand he kept  And on a Bear's rough Hide securely slept  Him  Phorbas  with his flying Dart transfix'd  Take thy next Draught with  Stygian  Waters mix'd  And sleep thy fill th' insulting Victor cry'd  Surpriz'd with Death unfelt the Centaur dy'd  The ruddy Vomit as he breath'd his Soul  Repass'd his Throat and fill'd his empty Bowl  I saw  Petraeus  ' Arms employ'd around  A wellgroan Oak to root it from the Ground  This way and that he wrench'd the fibrous Bands  The Trunk was like a Sappling in his Hands  And still obey'd the Bent While thus he stood  Perithous  ' Dart drove on and nail'd him to the Wood  Lycus  and  Chromys  fell by him oppress'd  Helops  and  Dictys  added to the rest  A nobler Palm  Helops  through either Ear  Transfix'd receiv'd the penetrating Spear  This  Dictys  saw and seiz'd with sudden Fright  Leapt headlong from the Hill of steepy height  And crush'd an Ash beneath that cou'd not bear his weight  The shatter'd Tree receives his Fall and strikes  Within his fullblown Paunch the sharpen'd Spikes  Strong  Aphareus  had heav'd a mighty Stone  The Fragment of a Rock and wou'd have thrown  But  Theseus  with a Club of harden'd Oak  The Cubitbone of the bold Centaur broke  And left him maim'd nor seconded the Stroke  Then leapt on tall  Bianor  's Back Who bore  No mortal Burden but his own before  Press'd with his Knees his Sides the double Man  His speed with Spurs increas'd unwilling ran  One Hand the Hero fasten'd on his Locks  His other ply'd him with repeated Strokes  The Club rung round his Ears and batter'd Brows  He falls and lashing up his Heels his Rider throws  The same  Herculean  Arms  Nedymnus  wound  And lay by him  Lycotas  on the Ground  And  Hippasus  whose Beard his Breast invades  And  Ripheus  Haunter of the Woodland Shades  And  Tereus  us'd with MountainBears to strive  And from their Dens to draw th'indignant Beasts alive  Demoleon  cou'd not bear this hateful Sight  Or the long Fortune of th'  Athenian  Knight  But pull'd with all his Force to disengage  From Earth a Pine the Product of an Age  The Root stuck fast The broken Trunk he sent  At  Theseus    Theseus  frustrates his Intent  And leaps aside by  Pallas  warn'd the Blow  To shun for so he said and we believ'd it so  Yet not in vain th' enormous Weight was cast  Which  Crantor  's Body sunder'd at the Waist  Thy Father's 'Squire  Achilles  and his Care  Whom conquer'd in the  Polopeian  War  Their King his present Ruin to prevent  A Pledge of Peace implor'd to  Peleus  sent  Thy Sire with grieving Eyes beheld his Fate  And cry'd Not long lov'd  Crantor  shalt thou wait  Thy vow'd Revenge At once he said and threw  His AshenSpear which quiver'd as it flew  With all his Force and all his Soul apply'd  The sharp Point enter'd in the Centaur's Side  Both Hands to wrench it out the Monster join'd  And wrench'd it out but left the Steel behind  Stuck in his Lungs it stood Inrag'd he rears  His Hoofs and down to Ground thy Father bears  Thus trampled under Foot his Shield defends  His Head his other Hand the Lance protends  Ev'n while he lay extended on the Dust  He sped the Centaur with one single Thrust  Two more his Lance before transfix'd from far  And two his Sword had slain in closer War  To these was added  Dorylas  who spread  A Bull's two goring Horns around his Head  With these he push'd in Blood already dy'd  Him fearless I approach'd and thus defy'd  Now Monster now by Proof it shall appear  Whether thy Horns are sharper or my Spear  At this I threw For want of other Ward  He lifted up his Hand his Front to guard  His Hand it pass'd and fix'd it to his Brow  Loud Shouts of ours attend the lucky Blow  Him  Peleus  finish'd with a second Wound  Which thro' the Navel pierc'd He reel'd around  And dragg'd his dangling Bowels on the Ground  Trod what he drag'd and what he trod he crush'd  And to his MotherEarth with empty Belly rush'd  The Story of CYLLARUS and HYLONOME  Nor cou'd thy Form O  Cyllarus  foreslow  Thy Fate if Form to Monsters Men allow  Just bloom'd thy Beard Thy Beard of golden Hue  Thy Locks in golden Waves about thy Shoulders flew  Sprightly thy Look Thy Shapes in ev'ry Part  So clean as might instruct the Sculptor's Art  As far as Man extended Where began  The Beast the Beast was equal to the Man  Add but a Horse's Head and Neck and he  O  Castor  was a Courser worthy thee  So was his Back proportion'd for the Seat  So rose his brawny Chest so swiftly mov'd his Feet  Coalblack his Colour but like Jet it shone  His Legs and flowing Tail were white alone  Belov'd by many Maidens of his Kind  But Fair  Hylonomè  possess'd his Mind  Hylonomè  for Features and for Face  Excelling all the Nymphs of double Race  Nor less her Blandishments than Beauty move  At once both loving and confessing Love  For him she dress'd For him with Female Care  She comb'd and set in Curls her auborn Hair  Of Roses Violets and Lillies mix'd  And Sprigs of flowing Rosemary betwixt  She form'd the Chaplet that adorn'd her Front  In Waters of the  Pagasaean  Fount  And in the Streams that from the Fountain play  She wash'd her Face and bath'd her twice a Day  The Scarf of Furs that hung below her Side  Was Ermin or the Panther's spotted Pride  Spoils of no common Beast With equal Flame  They lov'd Their Silvan Pleasures were the same  All Day they hunted And when Day expir'd  Together to some shady Cave retir'd  Invited to the Nuptials both repair  And Side by Side they both engage in War  Uncertain from what Hand a flying Dart  At  Cyllarus  was sent which pierc'd his Heart  The Javelin drawn from out the mortal Wound  He faints with stagg'ring Steps and seeks the Ground  The Fair within her Arms receiv'd his Fall  And strove his wand'ring Spirits to recall  And while her Hand the streaming Blood oppos'd  Join'd Face to Face his Lips with hers she clos'd  Stifled with Kisses a sweet Death he dies  She fills the Fields with undistinguish'd Cries  At least her Words were in her Clamour drown'd  For my stunn'd Ears receiv'd no vocal Sound  In madness of her Grief she seiz'd the Dart  Newdrawn and reeking from her Lover's Heart  To her bare Bosom the sharp Point apply'd  And wounded fell and falling by his Side  Embrac'd him in her Arms and thus embracing dy'd  Ev'n still methinks I see  Phaeocomes    Strange was his Habit and as odd his Dress  Six Lions Hides with Thongs together fast  His upper Part defended to his Waist  And where Man ended the continued Vest  Spread on his Back the Houss and Trappings of a Beast  A Stump too heavy for a Team to draw  It seems a Fable tho' the Fact I saw  He threw at  Pholon  the descending Blow  Divides the Skull and cleaves his Head in two  The Brains from Nose and Mouth and either Ear  Came issuing out as through a Colendar  The curdled Milk or from the Press the Whey  Driv'n down by Weights above is drain'd away  But him while stooping down to spoil the Slain  Pierc'd through the Paunch I tumbled on the Plain  Then  Chthonyus  and  Teleboas  I slew  A Fork the former arm'd a Dart his Fellow threw  The Javelin wounded me behold the Scar  Then was my Time to seek the  Trojan  War  Then I was  Hector  's Match in open Field  But he was then unborn at least a Child  Now I am nothing I forbear to tell  By  Periphantas  how  Pyretus  fell  The Centaur by the Knight Nor will I stay  On  Amphyx  or what Deaths he dealt that Day  What Honour with a pointless Lance he won  Stuck in the Front of a Fourfooted Man  What Fame young  Macareus  obtain'd in Fight  Or dwell on  Nessus  now return'd from Flight  How Prophet  Mopsus  not alone divin'd  Whose Valour equal'd his foreseeing Mind  CAENEUS transform'd to an EAGLE  Already  Caeneus  with his conquering Hand  Had slaughter'd five the boldest of their Band  Pyrachmus    Helymus    Antimachus    Bromus  the Brave and stronger  Stiphelus    Their Names I number'd and remember well  No Trace remaining by what Wounds they fell  Latreus  the bulkiest of the double Race  Whom the spoil'd Arms of slain  Halesus  grace  In Years retaining still his Youthful Might  Though his black Hairs were interspers'd with White  Betwixt th'imbattled Ranks began to prance  Proud of his Helm and  Macedonian  Lance  And rode the Ring around that either Hoast  Might hear him while he made this empty Boast  And from a Strumpet shall we suffer Shame  For  Caenis  still not  Caeneus  is thy Name  And still the Native Softness of thy Kind  Prevails and leaves the Woman in thy Mind  Remember what thou wert what Price was paid  To change thy Sex to make thee not a Maid  And but a Man in shew Go card and spin  And leave the Business of the War to Men  While thus the Boaster exercis'd his Pride  The fatal Spear of  Caeneus  reach'd his Side  Just in the mixture of the Kinds it ran  Betwixt the neather Beast and upper Man  The Monster mad with Rage and stung with Smart  His Lance directed at the Hero's Heart  It strook but bounded from his harden'd Breast  Like Hail from Tiles which the safe House invest  Nor seem'd the Stroke with more effect to come  Than a small Pebble falling on a Drum  He next his Fauchion try'd in closer Fight  But the keen Fauchion had no Pow'r to bite  He thrust the blunted Point return'd again  Since downright Blows he cry'd and Thrusts are vain  I'll prove his Side in strong Embraces held  He prov'd his Side his Side the Sword repell'd  His hollow Belly eccho'd to the Stroke  Untouch'd his Body as a solid Rock  Aim'd at his Neck at last the Blade in Shivers broke  Th'Impassive Knight stood Idle to deride  His Rage and offer'd oft his naked Side  At length now Monster in thy turn he cry'd  Try thou the Strength of  Caeneus  At the Word  He thrust and in his Shoulder plung'd the Sword  Then writh'd his Hand and as he drove it down  Deep in his Breast made many Wounds in one  The Centaurs saw inrag'd th'unhop'd Success  And rushing on in Crowds together press  At him and him alone their Darts they threw  Repuls'd they from his fated Body flew  Amaz'd they stood till  Monychus  began  O Shame a Nation conquer'd by a Man  A WomanMan yet more a Man is He  Than all our Race and what He was are We  Now what avail our Nerves th' united Force  Of two the strongest Creatures Man and Horse  Nor Goddessborn nor of  Ixion  's Seed  We seem a Lover built for  Juno  's Bed  Master'd by this half Man Whole Mountains throw  With Woods at once and bury him below  This only way remains Nor need we doubt  To choak the Soul within though not to force it out  Heap Weights instead of Wounds He chanc'd to see  Where Southern Storms had rooted up a Tree  This rais'd from Earth against the Foe he threw  Th'Example shewn his FellowBrutes pursue  With Forestloads the Warrior they invade  Othrys  and  Pelion  soon were void of Shade  And spreading Groves were naked Mountains made  Press'd with the Burden  Caeneus  pants for Breath  And on his Shoulders bears the Wooden Death  To heave th'intolerable Weight he tries  At length it rose above his Mouth and Eyes  Yet still he heaves and strugling with Despair  Shakes all aside and gains a gulp of Air  A short Relief which but prolongs his Pain  He faints by Fits and then respires again  At last the Burden only nods above  As when an Earthquake stirs th'  Idaean  Grove  Doubtful his Death He suffocated seem'd  To most but otherwise our  Mopsus  deem'd  Who said he saw a yellow Bird arise  From out the Pile and cleave the liquid Skies  I saw it too with golden Feathers bright  Nor e'er before beheld so strange a Sight  Whom  Mopsus  viewing as it soar'd around  Our Troop and heard the Pinions rattling Sound  All hail he cry'd thy Country's Grace and Love  Once first of Men below now first of Birds above  Its Author to the Story gave Belief  For us our Courage was increas'd by Grief  Asham'd to see a single Man pursu'd  With odds to sink beneath a Multitude  We push'd the Foe and forc'd to shameful Flight  Part fell and Part escap'd by Favour of the Night  The Fate of PERICLYMENOS  This Tale by  Nestor  told did much displease  Tlepolemus  the Seed of  Hercules    For often he had heard his Father say  That he himself was present at the Fray  And more than shar'd the Glories of the Day  Old Chronicle he said among the rest  You might have nam'd  Alcides  at the least  Is he not worth your Praise The  Pylian  Prince  Sigh'd ere he spoke then made this proud Defence  My former Woes in long Oblivion drown'd  I wou'd have lost but you renew the Wound  Better to pass him o'er than to relate  The Cause I have your mighty Sire to hate  His Fame has fill'd the World and reach'd the Sky  Which Oh I wish with Truth I cou'd deny  We praise not  Hector  though his Name we know  Is great in Arms 'tis hard to praise a Foe  He your great Father levell'd to the Ground  Messenia  's Tow'rs Nor better Fortune found  Elis  and  Pylos  That a neighb'ring State  And This my own Both guiltless of their Fate  To pass the rest twelve wanting one he slew  My Brethren who their Birth from  Neleus  drew  All Youths of early Promise had they liv'd  By him they perish'd I alone surviv'd  The rest were easie Conquest But the Fate  Of  Periclymenos  is wondrous to relate  To him our common Grandsire of the Main  Had giv'n to change his Form and chang'd resume again  Vary'd at Pleasure every Shape he try'd  And in all Beasts  Alcides  still defy'd  Vanquish'd on Earth at length he soar'd above  Chang'd to the Bird that bears the Bolt of  Jove    The newdissembled Eagle now endu'd  With Beak and Pounces  Hercules  pursu'd  And cuff'd his manly Cheeks and tore his Face  Then safe retir'd and tour'd in empty space  Alcides  bore not long his flying Foe  But bending his inevitable Bow  Reach'd him in Air suspended as he stood  And in his Pinion fix'd the feather'd Wood  Light was the Wound but in the Sinew hung  The Point and his disabled Wing unstrung  He wheel'd in Air and stretch'd his Vans in vain  His Vans no longer cou'd his Flight sustain  For while one gather'd Wind one unsupply'd  Hung drooping down nor pois'd his other Side  He fell The Shaft that slightly was impress'd  Now from his heavy Fall with weight increas'd  Drove through his Neck aslant he spurns the Ground  And the Soul issues through the Weazon's Wound  Now brave Commander of the  Rhodian  Seas  What Praise is due from me to  Hercules    Silence is all the Vengeance I decree  For my slain Brothers but 'tis Peace with thee  Thus with a flowing Tongue old  Nestor  spoke  Then to full Bowls each other they provoke  At length with Weariness and Wine oppress'd  They rise from Table and withdraw to Rest  The Death of ACHILLES  The Sire of  Cygnus  Monarch of the Main  Mean time laments his Son in Battel slain  And vows the Victor's Death nor vows in vain  For nine long Years the smother'd Pain he bore    Achilles  was not ripe for Fate before  Then when he saw the promis'd Hour was near  He thus bespoke the God that guides the Year  Immortal Offspring of my Brother  Jove    My brightest Nephew and whom best I love  Whose Hands were join'd with mine to raise the Wall  Of tottring  Troy  now nodding to her Fall  Dost thou not mourn our Pow'r employ'd in vain  And the Defenders of our City slain  To pass the rest cou'd noble  Hector  lie  Unpity'd drag'd around his Native  Troy    And yet the Murd'rer lives Himself by far  A greater Plague than all the wasteful War  He lives the proud  Pelides  lives to boast  Our Town destroy'd our common Labour lost  O could I meet him But I wish too late  To prove my Trident is not in his Fate  But let him try for that's allow'd thy Dart  And pierce his only penetrable Part  Apollo  bows to the superior Throne  And to his Uncle's Anger adds his own  Then in a Cloud involv'd he takes his Flight  Where  Greeks  and  Trojans  mix'd in mortal Fight  And found out  Paris  lurking where he stood  And stain'd his Arrows with  Plebeian  Blood  Phoebus  to him alone the God confess'd  Then to the recreant Knight he thus address'd  Dost thou not blush to spend thy Shafts in vain  On a degenerate and ignoble Train  If Fame or better Vengeance by thy Care  There aim And with one Arrow end the War  He said and shew'd from far the blazing Shield  And Sword which but  Achilles  none cou'd wield  And how he mov'd a God and mow'd the standing Field  The Deity himself directs aright  Th' invenom'd Shaft and wings the fatal Flight  Thus fell the foremost of the  Grecian  Name  And He the base Adult'rer boasts the Fame  A Spectacle to glad the  Trojan  Train  And please old  Priam  after  Hector  slain  If by a Female Hand he had foreseen  He was to die his Wish had rather been  The Lance and double Ax of the fair Warriour Queen  And now the Terror of the  Trojan  Field  The  Grecian  Honour Ornament and Shield  High on a Pile th' Unconquer'd Chief is plac'd  The God that arm'd him first consum'd at last  Of all the mighty Man the small Remains  A little Urn and scarcely fill'd contains  Yet great in  Homer  still  Achilles  lives  And equal to himself himself survives  His Buckler owns its former Lord and brings  New cause of Strife betwixt contending Kings  Who Worthiest after him his Sword to wield  Or wear his Armour or sustain his Shield  Ev'n  Diomede  sate mute with downcast Eyes  Conscious of wanted Worth to win the Prize  Nor  Menelaus  presum'd these Arms to claim  Nor He the King of Men a greater Name  Two Rivals only rose  Laertes  ' Son  And the vast Bulk of  Ajax Telamon    The King who cherish'd each with equal Love  And from himself all Envy wou'd remove  Left both to be determin'd by the Laws  And to the  Grecian  Chiefs transferr'd the Cause  The End of the Twelfth Book  To the Honourable M  rs  Margaret Pelha  E Kirkall sc  OVID's METAMORPHOSES BOOK XIII  Translated by Mr DRYDEN and Others  The Speeches of AJAX and ULYSSES  By Mr DRYDEN  _THE Chiefs were set the Soldiers crown'd the Field  To these the Master of the sevenfold Shield  Upstarted fierce And kindled with Disdain  Eager to speak unable to contain  His boiling Rage he rowl'd his Eyes around  The Shore and  Grecian  Gallies hall'd aground  Then stretching out his Hands O  Jove  he cry'd  Must then our Cause before the Fleet be try'd  And dares  Ulysses  for the Prize contend  In sight of what he durst not once defend  But basely fled that memorable Day  When I from  Hector  's Hands redeem'd the flaming Prey  So much 'tis safer at the noisie Bar  With Words to flourish than ingage in War  By diff'rent Methods we maintain our Right  Nor am I made to Talk nor he to Fight  In bloody Fields I labour to be great  His Arms are a smooth Tongue and soft Deceit  Nor need I speak my Deeds for those you see  The Sun and Day are Witnesses for me  Let him who fights unseen relate his own  And vouch the silent Stars and conscious Moon  Great is the Prize demanded I confess  But such an abject Rival makes it less  That Gift those Honours he but hop'd to gain  Can leave no room for  Ajax  to be vain  Losing he wins because his Name will be  Ennobled by Defeat who durst contend with me  Were my known Valour question'd yet my Blood  Without that Plea wou'd make my Title good  My Sire was  Telamon  whose Arms employ'd  With  Hercules  these  Trojan  Walls destroy'd  And who before with  Jason  sent from  Greece    In the first Ship brought home the Golden Fleece  Great  Telamon  from  Aeacus  derives  His Birth th' Inquisitor of guilty Lives  In Shades below where  Sisyphus  whose Son  This Thief is thought rouls up the restless heavy Stone  Just  Aeacus  the King of Gods above  Begot Thus  Ajax  is the third from  Jove  Nor shou'd I seek Advantage from my Line  Unless  Achilles  it were mix'd with thine  As next of Kin  Achilles  ' Arms I claim  This Fellow wou'd ingraft a Foreign Name  Upon our Stock and the  Sisyphian  Seed  By Fraud and Theft asserts his Father's Breed  Then must I lose these Arms because I came  To fight uncall'd a voluntary Name  Nor shunn'd the Cause but offer'd you my Aid  While he long lurking was to War betray'd  Forc'd to the Field he came but in the Reer  And feign'd Distraction to conceal his Fear  Till one more cunning caught him in the Snare  Ill for himself and dragg'd him into War  Now let a Hero's Arms a Coward vest  And he who shunn'd all Honours gain the best  And let me stand excluded from my Right  Robb'd of my Kinsman's Arms who first appear'd in Fight  Better for us at home had he remain'd  Had it been true the Madness which he feign'd  Or so believ'd the less had been our Shame  The less his counsell'd Crime which brands the  Grecian  Name  Nor  Philoctetes  had been left inclos'd  In a bare Isle to Wants and Pains expos'd  Where to the Rocks with solitary Groans  His Suff'rings and our Baseness he bemoans  And wishes so may Heav'n his Wish fulfill  The due Reward to him who caus'd his Ill  Now he with us to  Troy  's Destruction sworn  Our Brother of the War by whom are born  Alcides  ' Arrows pent in narrow Bounds  With Cold and Hunger pinch'd and pain'd with Wounds  To find him Food and Cloathing must employ  Against the Birds the Shafts due to the Fate of  Troy  Yet still he lives and lives from Treason free  Because he left  Ulysses  ' Company  Poor  Palamede  might wish so void of Aid  Rather to have been left than so to Death betray'd  The Coward bore the Man immortal Spight  Who sham'd him out of Madness into Fight  Nor daring otherwise to vent his Hate  Accus'd him first of Treason to the State  And then for proof produc'd the golden Store  Himself had hidden in his Tent before  Thus of two Champions he depriv'd our Host  By Exile one and one by Treason lost  Thus fights  Ulysses  thus his Fame extends  A formidable Man but to his Friends  Great for what Greatness is in Words and Sound  Ev'n faithful  Nestor  less in both is found  But that he might without a Rival reign  He left this faithful  Nestor  on the Plain  Forsook his Friend ev'n at his utmost Need  Who tir'd and tardy with his wounded Steed  Cry'd out for Aid and call'd him by his Name  But Cowardice has neither Ears nor Shame  Thus fled the good old Man bereft of Aid  And for as much as lay in him betray'd  That this is not a Fable forg'd by me  Like one of his an  Ulyssean  Lie  I vouch ev'n  Diomede  who tho' his Friend  Cannot that Act excuse much less defend  He call'd him back aloud and tax'd his Fear  And sure enough he heard but durst not hear  The Gods with equal Eyes on Mortals look  He justly was forsaken who forsook  Wanted that Succour he refus'd to lend  Found ev'ry Fellow such another Friend  No wonder if he roar'd that all might hear  His Elocution was increas'd by Fear  I heard I ran I found him out of Breath  Pale trembling and half dead with fear of Death  Though he had judg'd himself by his own Laws  And stood condemn'd I help'd the common Cause  With my broad Buckler hid him from the Foe  Ev'n the Shield trembled as he lay below  And from impending Fate the Coward freed  Good Heav'n forgive me for so bad a Deed  If still he will persist and urge the Strife  First let him give me back his forfeit Life  Let him return to that opprobrious Field  Again creep under my protecting Shield  Let him lie wounded let the Foe be near  And let his quiv'ring Heart confess his Fear  There put him in the very Jaws of Fate  And let him plead his Cause in that Estate  And yet when snatch'd from Death when from below  My lifted Shield I loos'd and let him go  Good Heav'ns how light he rose with what a bound  He sprung from Earth forgetful of his Wound  How fresh how eager then his Feet to ply  Who had not Strength to stand had Speed to fly  Hector  came on and brought the Gods along  Fear seiz'd alike the Feeble and the Strong  Each  Greek  was an  Ulysses  such a Dread  Th' Approach and ev'n the Sound of  Hector  bred  Him flesh'd with Slaughter and with Conquest crown'd  I met and overturn'd him to the Ground  When after matchless as he deem'd in Might  He challeng'd all our Host to single Fight  All Eyes were fix'd on me The Lots were thrown  But for your Champion I was wish'd alone  Your Vows were heard we fought and neither yield  Yet I return'd unvanquish'd from the Field  With  Jove  to friend th' insulting  Trojan  came  And menac'd us with Force our Fleet with Flame  Was it the Strength of this Tonguevaliant Lord  In that black Hour that sav'd you from the Sword  Or was my Breast expos'd alone to brave  A thousand Swords a thousand Ships to save  The hopes of your return And can you yield  For a sav'd Fleet less than a single Shield  Think it no Boast O  Grecians  if I deem  These Arms want  Ajax  more than  Ajax  them  Or I with them an equal Honour share  They honour'd to be worn and I to wear  Will he compare my Courage with his Sleight  As well he may compare the Day with Night  Night is indeed the Province of his Reign  Yet all his dark Exploits no more contain  Than a Spy taken and a Sleeper slain  A Priest made Pris'ner  Pallas  made a Prey  But none of all these Actions done by Day  Nor ought of these was done and  Diomede  away  If on such petty Merits you confer  So vast a Prize let each his Portion share  Make a just Dividend and if not all  The greater part to  Diomede  will fall  But why for  Ithacus  such Arms as those  Who naked and by Night invades his Foes  The glitt'ring Helm by Moonlight will proclaim  The latent Robber and prevent his Game  Nor cou'd he hold his tott'ring Head upright  Beneath that Morion or sustain the Weight  Nor that right Arm cou'd toss the beamy Lance  Much less the left that ampler Shield advance  Pond'rous with precious Weight and rough with Cost  Of the round World in rising Gold emboss'd  That Orb would ill become his Hand to wield  And look as for the Gold he stole the Shield  Which shou'd your Error on the Wretch bestow  It would not frighten but allure the Foe  Why asks he what avails him not in Fight  And wou'd but cumber and retard his Flight  In which his only Excellence is plac'd  You give him Death that intercept his Haste  Add that his own is yet a MaidenShield  Nor the least Dint has suffer'd in the Field  Guiltless of Fight Mine batter'd hew'd and bor'd  Worn out of Service must forsake his Lord  What farther need of Words our Right to scan  My Arguments are Deeds let Action speak the Man  Since from a Champion's Arms the Strife arose  So cast the glorious Prize amid the Foes  Then send us to redeem both Arms and Shield  And let him wear who wins 'em in the Field  He said A Murmur from a Multitude  Or somewhat like a stifled Shout ensu'd  Till from his Seat arose  Laertes  ' Son  Look'd down a while and paus'd ere he begun  Then to th' expecting Audience rais'd his Look  And not without prepar'd Attention spoke  Soft was his Tone and sober was his Face  Action his Words and Words his Action grace  If Heav'n my Lords had heard our common Pray'r▪  These Arms had caus'd no Quarrel for an Heir  Still great  Achilles  had his own possess'd  And we with great  Achilles  had been bless'd  But since hard Fate and Heav'n's severe Decree  Have ravish'd him away from you and me  At this he sigh'd and wip'd his Eyes and drew  Or seem'd to draw some Drops of kindly Dew  Who better can succeed  Achilles  lost  Than He who gave  Achilles  to your Hoast  This only I request that neither He  May gain by being what he seems to be  A stupid Thing nor I may lose the Prize  By having Sense which Heav'n to him denies  Since great or small the Talent I enjoy'd  Was ever in the common Cause employ'd  Nor let my Wit and wonted Eloquence  Which often has been us'd in your Defence  And in my own this only time be brought  To bear against my self and deem'd a Fault  Make not a Crime where Nature made it none  For ev'ry Man may freely use his own  The Deeds of long descended Ancestors  Are but by grace of Imputation ours  Theirs in Effect but since he draws his Line  From  Jove  and seems to plead a Right Divine  From  Jove  like him I claim my Pedigree  And am descended in the same Degree  My Sire  Laertes  was  Arcesius  ' Heir  Arcesius  was the Son of  Jupiter    No Parricide no banish'd Man is known  In all my Line Let him excuse his own  Hermes  ennobles too my Mother's Side  By both my Parents to the Gods ally'd  But not because that on the Female Part  My Blood is better dare I claim Desert  Or that my Sire from Parricide is free  But judge by Merit betwixt Him and Me  The Prize be to the best provided yet  That  Ajax  for a while his Kin forget  And his great Sire and greater Uncle's Name  To fortifie by them his feeble Claim  Be Kindred and Relation laid aside  And Honour's Cause by Laws of Honour try'd  For if he plead Proximity of Blood  That empty Title is with Ease withstood  Peleus  the Hero's Sire more nigh than he  And  Pyrrhus  his undoubted Progeny  Inherit first these Trophies of the Field  To  Scyros  or to  Phthia  send the Shield  And  Teucer  has an Uncle's Right yet he  Waves his Pretensions nor contends with me  Then since the Cause on pure Desert is plac'd  Whence shall I take my rise what reckon last  I not presume on ev'ry Act to dwell  But take these few in order as they fell  Thetis  who knew the Fates apply'd her Care  To keep  Achilles  in Disguise from War  And till the threatning Influence were past  A Woman's Habit on the Hero cast  All Eyes were cozen'd by the borrow'd Vest  And  Ajax  never wiser than the rest  Found no  Pelides  there At length I came  With proffer'd Wares to this pretended Dame  She not discover'd by her Mien or Voice  Betray'd her Manhood by her manly Choice  And while on Female Toys her Fellows look  Grasp'd in her Warlike Hand a Javelin shook  Whom by this Act reveal'd I thus bespoke  O Goddessborn resist not Heav'n's Decree  The Fall of  Ilium  is reserv'd for Thee  Then seiz'd him and produc'd in open Light  Sent blushing to the Field the fatal Knight  Mine then are all his Actions of the War  Great  Telephus  was conquer'd by my Spear  And after cur'd To me the  Thebans  owe  Lesbos  and  Tenedos  their overthrow  Syros  and  Cylla  Not on all to dwell  By me  Lyrnesus  and strong  Chrysa  fell  And since I sent the Man who  Hector  slew  To me the noble  Hector  's Death is due  Those Arms I put into his living Hand  Those Arms  Pelides  dead I now demand  When  Greece  was injur'd in the  Spartan  Prince  And met at  Aulis  to avenge th' Offence  'Twas a dead Calm or adverse Blasts that reign'd  And in the Port the Windbound Fleet detain'd  Bad Signs were seen and Oracles severe  Were daily thunder'd in our Gen'ral's Ear  That by his Daughter's Blood we must appease  Diana  's kindled Wrath and free the Seas  Affection Int'rest Fame his Heart assail'd  But soon the Father o'er the King prevail'd  Bold on himself he took the pious Crime  As angry with the Gods as they with him  No Subject cou'd sustain their Sov'reign's Look  Till this hard Enterprize I undertook  I only durst th' Imperial Pow'r controul  And undermin'd the Parent in his Soul  Forc'd him t'exert the King for common Good  And pay our Ransom with his Daughter's Blood  Never was Cause more difficult to plead  Than where the Judge against himself decreed  Yet this I won by dint of Argument  The Wrongs his injur'd Brother underwent  And his own Office sham'd him to consent  'Twas harder yet to move the Mother's Mind  And to this heavy Task was I design'd  Reasons against her Love I knew were vain  I circumvented whom I could not gain  Had  Ajax  been employ'd our slacken'd Sails  Had still at  Aulis  waited happy Gales  Arriv'd at  Troy  your Choice was fix'd on me  A fearless Envoy fit for a bold Embassy  Secure I enter'd through the hostile Court  Glitt'ring with Steel and crowded with Resort  There in the midst of Arms I plead our Cause  Urge the foul Rape and violated Laws  Accuse the Foes as Authors of the Strife  Reproach the Ravisher demand the Wife  Priam    Antenor  and the wiser few  I mov'd but  Paris  and his lawless Crew  Scarce held their Hands and lifted Swords but stood  In Act to quench their impious Thirst of Blood  This  Menclaus  knows expos'd to share  With me the rough Preludium of the War  Endless it were to tell what I have done  In Arms or Council since the Siege begun  The first Encounter's past the Foe repell'd  They skulk'd within the Town we kept the Field  War seem'd asleep for nine long Years at length  Both Sides resolv'd to push we try'd our Strength  Now what did  Ajax  while our Arms took Breath  Vers'd only in the gross mechanick Trade of Death  If you require my Deeds with ambush'd Arms  I trapp'd the Foe or tir'd with false Alarms  Secur'd the Ships drew Lines along the Plain  The Fainting chear'd chastis'd the Rebeltrain  Provided Forage our spent Arms renew'd  Employ'd at home or sent abroad the common Cause pursu'd  The King deluded in a Dream by  Jove    Despair'd to take the Town and order'd to remove  What Subject durst arraign the Pow'r Supream  Producing  Jove  to justifie his Dream  Ajax  might wish the Soldiers to retain  From shameful Flight but Wishes were in vain  As wanting of Effect had been his Words  Such as of Course his thundring Tongue affords  But did this Boaster threaten did he pray  Or by his own Example urge their Stay  None none of these but ran himself away  I saw him run and was asham'd to see  Who ply'd his Feet so fast to get aboard as He  Then speeding through the Place I made a stand  And loudly cry'd O base degenerate Band  To leave a Town already in your Hand  After so long Expence of Blood for Fame  To bring home nothing but perpetual Shame  These Words or what I have forgotten since  For Grief inspir'd me then with Eloquence  Reduc'd their Minds they leave the crowded Port  And to their late forsaken Camp resort  Dismayd the Council met This Man was there  But mute and not recover'd of his Fear  Thersites  tax'd the King and loudly rail'd  But his wide opening Mouth with Blows I seal'd  Then rising I excite their Souls to Fame  And kindle sleeping Virtue into Flame  From thence whatever he perform'd in Fight  Is justly mine who drew him back from Flight  Which of the  Grecian  Chiefs consorts with Thee  But  Diomede  desires my Company  And still communicates his Praise with me  As guided by a God secure he goes  Arm'd with my Fellowship amid the Foes  And sure no little Merit I may boast  Whom such a Man selects from such an Hoast  Unforc'd by Lots I went without affright  To dare with him the Dangers of the Night  On the same Errand sent we met the Spy  Of  Hector  doubletongu'd and us'd to lie  Him I dispatch'd but not till undermin'd  I drew him first to tell what treach'rous  Troy  design'd  My Task perform'd with Praise I had retir'd  But not content with this to greater Praise aspir'd  Invaded  Rhesus  and his  Thracian  Crew  And him and his in their own Strength I slew  Return'd a Victor all my Vows compleat  With the King's Chariot in his Royal Seat  Refuse me now his Arms whose fiery Steeds  Were promis'd to the Spy for his Nocturnal Deeds  And let dull  Ajax  bear away my Right  When all his Days outbalance this one Night  Nor fought I Darkling still The Sun beheld  With slaughter'd  Lycians  when I strew'd the Field  You saw and counted as I pass'd along  Alastor    Chromius    Ceranos  the Strong  Alcander    Prytanis  and  Halius    Noemon    Charopes  and  Ennomus    Coon    Chersidamas  and five beside  Men of obscure Descent but Courage try'd  All these this Hand laid breathless on the Ground  Nor want I Proofs of many a manly Wound  All honest all before Believe not me  Words may deceive but credit what you see  At this he bar'd his Breast and show'd his Scars  As of a furrow'd Field well plough'd with Wars  Nor is this Part unexercis'd said he  That Gyantbulk of his from Wounds is free  Safe in his Shield he fears no Foe to try  And better manages his Blood than I  But this avails me not our Boaster strove  Not with our Foes alone but partial  Jove    To save the Fleet This I confess is true  Nor will I take from any Man his due  But thus assuming all he robs from you  Some part of Honour to your share will fall  He did the best indeed but did not all  Patroclus  in  Achilles  ' Arms and thought  The Chief he seem'd with equal Ardour fought  Preserv'd the Fleet repell'd the raging Fire  And forc'd the fearful  Trojans  to retire  But  Ajax  boasts that he was only thought  A Match for  Hector  who the Combat sought  Sure he forgets the King the Chiefs and Me  All were as eager for the Fight as He  He but the ninth and not by publick Voice  Or ours preferr'd was only Fortune's Choice  They fought nor can our Hero boast th' Event  For  Hector  from the Field unwounded went  Why am I forc'd to name that fatal Day  That snatch'd the Prop and Pride of  Greece  away  I saw  Pelides  sink with pious Grief  And ran in vain alas to his Relief  For the brave Soul was fled Full of my Friend  I rush'd amid the War his Relicks to defend  Nor ceas'd my Toil till I redeem'd the Prey  And loaded with  Achilles  march'd away  Those Arms which on these Shoulders then I bore  'Tis just you to these Shoulders should restore  You see I want not Nerves who cou'd sustain  The pond'rous Ruins of so great a Man  Or if in others equal Force you find  None is endu'd with a more grateful Mind  Did  Thetis  then ambitious in her Care  These Arms thus labour'd for her Son prepare  That  Ajax  after him the heav'nly Gift shou'd wear  For that dull Soul to stare with stupid Eyes  On the learn'd unintelligible Prize  What are to him the Sculptures of the Shield  Heav'n's Planets Earth and Ocean's watry Field  The  Pleiads    Hyads  less and greater  Bear    Undipp'd in Seas  Orion  's angry Star  Two diff'ring Cities grav'd on either Hand  Would he wear Arms he cannot understand  Beside what wise Objections he prepares  Against my late Accession to the Wars  Does not the Fool perceive his Argument  Is with more Force against  Achilles  bent  For if Dissembling be so great a Crime  The Fault is common and the same in him  And if he taxes both of long delay  My Guilt is less who sooner came away  His pious Mother anxious for his Life  Detain'd her Son and me my pious Wife  To them the Blossoms of our Youth were due  Our riper Manhood we reserv'd for you  But grant me guilty 'tis not much my Care  When with so great a Man my Guilt I share  My Wit to War the matchless Hero brought  But by this Fool I never had been caught  Nor need I wonder that on me he threw  Such foul Aspersions when he spares not you  If  Palamede  unjustly fell by me  Your Honour suffer'd in th' unjust Decree  I but accus'd you doom'd And yet he dy'd  Convinc'd of Treason and was fairly try'd  You heard not he was false your Eyes beheld  The Traytor manifest the Bribe reveal'd  That  Philoctetes  is on  Lemnos  left  Wounded forlorn of human Aid bereft  Is not my Crime or not my Crime alone  Defend your Justice for the Fact's your own  'Tis true th' Advice was mine that staying there  He might his weary Limbs with Rest repair  From a long Voyage free and from a longer War  He took the Counsel and he lives at least  Th' Event declares I counsell'd for the best  Though Faith is all in Ministers of State  For who can promise to be fortunate  Now since his Arrows are the Fate of  Troy    Do not my Wit or weak Address employ  Send  Ajax  there with his persuasive Sense  To mollifie the Man and draw him thence  But  Xanthus  shall run backward  Ida  stand  A leafless Mountain and the  Grecian  Band  Shall fight for  Troy  if when my Counsel fail  The Wit of heavy  Ajax  can prevail  Hard  Philoctetes  exercise thy Spleen  Against thy Fellows and the King of Men  Curse my devoted Head above the rest  And wish in Arms to meet me Breast to Breast  Yet I the dang'rous Task will undertake  And either die my self or bring thee back  Nor doubt the same Success as when before  The  Phrygian  Prophet to these Tents I bore  Surpriz'd by Night and forc'd him to declare  In what was plac'd the Fortune of the War  Heav'n's dark Decrees and Answers to display  And how to take the Town and where the Secret lay  Yet this I compass'd and from  Troy  convey'd  The fatal Image of their GuardianMaid  That Work was mine for  Pallas  though our Friend  Yet while she was in  Troy  did  Troy  defend  Now what has  Ajax  done or what design'd  A noisie Nothing and an empty Wind  If he be what he promises in Show  Why was I sent and why fear'd he to go  Our boasting Champion thought the Task not light  To pass the Guards commit himself to Night  Not only through a hostile Town to pass  But scale with steep Ascent the sacred Place  With wand'ring Steps to search the Cittadel  And from the Priests their Patroness to steal  Then through surrounding Foes to force my way  And bear in Triumph home the heav'nly Prey  Which had I not  Ajax  in vain had held  Before that monst'rous Bulk his sev'nfold Shield  That Night to conquer  Troy  I might be said  When  Troy  was liable to Conquest made  Why point'st thou to my Partner of the War  Tydides  had indeed a worthy Share  In all my Toil and Praise but when thy Might  Our Ships protected did'st thou singly fight  All join'd and thou of many wert but one  I ask'd no Friend nor had but him alone  Who had he not been well assur'd that Art  And Conduct were of War the better part  And more avail'd than Strength my valiant Friend  Had urg'd a better Right than  Ajax  can pretend  As good at least  Eurypylus  may claim  And the more moderate  Ajax  of the Name  The  Cretan  King and his brave Charioteer  And  Menelaus  bold with Sword and Spear  All these had been my Rivals in the Shield  And yet all these to my Pretensions yield  Thy boist'rous Hands are then of use when I  With this directing Head those Hands apply  Brawn without Brain is thine My prudent Care  Foresees provides administers the War  Thy Province is to Fight but when shall be  The time to Fight the King consults with me  No Dram of Judgment with thy Force is join'd  Thy Body is of Profit and my Mind  By how much more the Ship her Safety owes  To him who steers than him that only rows  By how much more the Captain merits Praise  Than he who fights and fighting but obeys  By so much greater is my Worth than thine  Who canst but execute what I design  What gain'st thou brutal Man if I confess  Thy Strength superior when thy Wit is less  Mind is the Man I claim my whole Desert  From the Mind's Vigour and th' immortal Part  But you O  Grecian  Chiefs reward my Care  Be grateful to your Watchman of the War  For all my Labours in so long a space  Sure I may plead a Title to your Grace  Enter the Town I then unbarr'd the Gates  When I remov'd their tutelary Fates  By all our common Hopes if Hopes they be  Which I have now reduc'd to Certainty  By falling  Troy  by yonder tott'ring Tow'rs  And by their taken Gods which now are ours  Or if there yet a farther Task remains  To be perform'd by Prudence or by Pains  If yet some desp'rate Action rests behind  That asks high Conduct and a dauntless Mind  If ought be wanting to the  Trojan  Doom  Which none but I can manage and o'ercome  Award those Arms I ask by your Decree  Or give to this what you refuse to me  He ceas'd And ceasing with Respect he bow'd  And with his Hand at once the fatal Statue show'd  Heav'n Air and Ocean rung with loud Applause  And by the gen'ral Vote he gain'd his Cause  Thus Conduct won the Prize when Courage fail'd  And Eloquence o'er brutal Force prevail'd  The Death of AJAX  He who cou'd often and alone withstand  The Foe the Fire and  Jove  's own partial Hand  Now cannot his unmaster'd Grief sustain  But yields to Rage to Madness and Disdain  Then snatching out his Fauchion Thou said He  Art mine  Ulysses  lays no Claim to Thee  O often try'd and ever trusty Sword  Now do thy last kind Office to thy Lord  'Tis  Ajax  who requests thy Aid to show  None but himself himself cou'd overthrow  He said and with so good a Will to die  Did to his Breast the fatal Point apply  It found his Heart a way till then unknown  Where never Weapon enter'd but his own  No Hands cou'd force it thence so fix'd it stood  Till out it rush'd expell'd by Streams of spouting Blood  The fruitful Blood produc'd a Flow'r which grew  On

Snatch'd from her Mother who with pious Care  Cherish'd this last Relief of her Despair  Superior to her Sex the fearless Maid  Approach'd the Altar and around survey'd  The cruel Rites and consecrated Knife  Which  Pyrrhus  pointed at her guiltless Life  Then as with stern Amaze intent he stood  " Now strike she said now spill my Gen'rous Blood  " Deep in my Breast or Throat your Dagger sheath  " Whilst thus I stand prepar'd to meet my Death  " For Life on terms of Slav'ry I despise  " Yet sure no God approves this Sacrifice  " O cou'd I but conceal this dire Event  " From my sad Mother I should dye content  " Yet should she not with Tears my Death deplore  " Since her own wretched Life demands them more  " But let not the rude Touch of Man pollute  " A VirginVictim 'tis a

 " 'Tis  Priam  's Daughter not a Captive sues  " Do not the Rites of Sepulture refuse  " To my afflicted Mother I implore  " Free without Ransom my dead Corpse restore  " Nor barter me for Gain when I am cold  " But be her Tears the Price if I am sold  " Time was she could have ransom'd me with Gold  Thus as she pray'd one common Shower of Tears  Burst forth and stream'd from ev'ry Eye but hers  Ev'n the Priest wept and with a rude Remorse  Plung'd in her Heart the Steel's resistless Force  Her slacken'd Limbs sunk gently to the Ground  Dauntless her Looks unalter'd by the Wound  And as she fell she strove with decent Pride  To guard what suits a Virgin's Care to hide  The  Trojan  Matrons the pale Corpse receive  And the whole slaughter'd Race of  Priam  grieve  Sad they recount the long disastrous Tale  Then with fresh Tears Thee Royal Maid bewail  Thy widow'd Mother too who flourish'd late  The Royal Pride of  Asia  's happier State  A Captive Lot now to  Ulysses  born  Whom yet the Victor would reject with Scorn  Were she not  Hector  's Mother  Hector  's Fame  Scarce can a Master for his Mother claim  With strict Embrace the lifeless Coarse she view'd  And her fresh Grief that flood of Tears renew'd  With which she lately mourn'd so many dead  Tears for her Country Sons and Husband shed  With the thick gushing Stream she bath'd the Wound  Kiss'd her pale Lips then weltring on the Ground  With wonted Rage her frantick Bosom tore  Sweeping her Hair amidst the clotted Gore  Whilst her sad Accents thus her Loss deplore  " Behold a Mother's last dear Pledge of Woe  " Yes 'tis the last I have to suffer now  " Thou my  Polyxena  my Ills must crown  " Already in thy Fate I feel my own  " 'Tis thus least haply of my num'rous Seed  " One should unslaughter'd

I said  " Secure of future Ills He can no more  " But see he still pursues me as before  " With Rage rekindled his dead Ashes burn  " And his yet murd'ring Ghost my wretched House must mourn  " This

so and happy must I deem  "His Death for O my Child he saw not thine  " When he his Life did with his  Troy  resign  " Yet sure due Obsequies thy Tomb might grace  " And thou shalt sleep amidst thy Kingly Race  " Alas my Child such Fortune does not wait  " Our Suffering House in this abandon'd State  " A foreign Grave and thy poor Mother's Tears  " Are all the Honours that attend thy Herse  " All now is lostYet no One Comfort more  " Of Life remains my muchlov'd  Polydore    " My youngest Hope Here on this Coast he lives  " Nurs'd by the GuardianKing he still survives  " Then let me hasten to the cleansing Flood  " And wash away these Stains of guiltless Blood  Strait to the Shore her feeble Steps repair  With limping Pace and torn dishevell'd Hair  Silver'd with Age " Give me an Urn she cry'd  " To bear back Water from this swelling Tide  When on the Banks her Son in ghastly Hue  Transfix'd with  Thracian  Arrows strikes her View  The Matrons shriek'd her bigswoln Grief surpast  The Pow'r of Utterance she stood aghast  She had nor Speech nor Tears to give Relief  Excess of Woe suppress'd the rising Grief  Lifeless as Stone on Earth she fix'd her Eyes  And then look'd up to Heav'n with wild Surprise  Now she contemplates o'er with sad Delight  Her Son's pale Visage then her aking Sight  Dwells on his Wounds She varys thus by turns  Till with collected Rage at length she burns  Wild as the MotherLion when among  The Haunts of Prey she seeks her ravish'd young  Swift flies the Ravisher she marks his Trace  And by the Print directs her anxious Chase  So  Hecuba  with mingled Grief and Rage  Pursues the King regardless of her Age  She greets the Murd'rer with dissembled Joy  Of secret Treasure hoarded for her Boy  The specious Tale th' unwary King betray'd  Fir'd with the Hopes of Prey " Give quick he said  " With soft enticing Speech the promis'd Store  " Whate're you give you give to  Polydore  " Your Son by the immortal Gods I swear  " Shall this with all your former Bounty share  She stands attentive to his soothing Lyes  And darts avenging Horrour from her Eyes  Then full Resentment fires her boyling Blood  She springs upon him 'midst the Captive Crowd  Her thirst of Vengeance want of Strength supplies  Fastens her forky Fingers in his Eyes  Tears out the rooted Balls her Rage pursues  And in the hollow Orbs her Hand imbrews  The  Thracians  fir'd at this inhuman Scene  With Darts and Stones assail the frantick Queen  She snarls and growls nor in an human Tone  Then bites impatient at the bounding Stone  Extends her Jaws as she her Voice would raise  To keen Invectives in her wonted Phrase  But barks and thence the yelping Brute betrays  Still a sad Monument the Place remains  And from this Monstrous Change its Name obtains  Where she in long Remembrance of her Ills  With plaintive Howlings the wide Desart fills  Greeks    Trojans  Friends and Foes and Gods above  Her num'rous Wrongs to just Compassion move  Ev'n  Juno  's self forgets her ancient Hate  And owns she had deserv'd a milder Fate  The Funeral of MEMNON  By Mr CROXALL  Yet bright  Aurora  partial as she was  To  Troy  and those that lov'd the  Trojan  Cause  Nor  Troy  nor  Hecuba  can now bemoan  But weeps a sad Misfortune more her own  Her Offspring  Memnon  by  Achilles  slain  She saw extended on the  Phrygian  Plain  She saw and strait the Purple Beams that grace  The rosie Morning vanish'd from her Face  A deadly Pale her wonted Bloom invades  And veils the lowring Skies with mournful Shades  But when his Limbs upon the Pile were laid  The last kind Duty that by Friends is paid  His Mother to the Skies directs her Flight  Nor cou'd sustain to view the doleful Sight  But frantick with her loose neglected Hair  Hastens to  Jove  and falls a Suppliant there  O King of Heaven O Father of the Skies  The weeping Goddess passionately cries  Tho' I the meanest of Immortals am  And fewest Temples celebrate my Fame  Yet still a Goddess I presume to come  Within the Verge of your Ethereal Dome  Yet still may plead some Merit if my Light  With Purple Dawn controuls the Pow'rs of Night  If from a Female Hand that Virtue springs  Which to the Gods and Men such Pleasure brings  Yet I nor Honours seek nor Rites Divine  Nor for more Altars or more Fanes repine  Oh that such Trifles were the only Cause  From whence  Aurora  's Mind its Anguish draws  For  Memnon  lost my dearest only Child  With weightier Grief my heavy Heart is fill'd  My Warrior Son that liv'd but half his Time  Nipt in the Bud and blasted in his Prime  Who for his Uncle early took the Field  And by  Achilles  ' fatal Spear was kill'd  To whom but  Jove  shou'd I for Succour come  For  Jove  alone cou'd fix his cruel Doom  O Sovereign of the Gods accept my Pray'r  Grant my Request and sooth a Mother's Care  On the Deceas'd some solemn Boon bestow  To expiate the Loss and ease my Woe  Jove  with a Nod comply'd with her Desire  Around the Body flam'd the Funeral Fire  The Pile decreas'd that lately seem'd so high  And Sheets of Smoak roll'd upward to the Sky  As humid Vapours from a marshy Bog  Rise by Degrees condensing into Fog  That intercept the Sun's enlivening Ray  And with a Cloud infect the chearful Day  The sooty Ashes wafted by the Air  Whirl round and thicken in a Body there  Then take a Form which their own Heat and Fire  With active Life and Energy inspire  Its Lightness makes it seem to fly and soon  It skims on real Wings that are its own  A real Bird it beats the breezy Wind  Mix'd with a thousand Sisters of the Kind  That from the same Formation newly sprung  Upborn aloft on plumy Pinions hung  Thrice round the Pile advanc'd the circling Throng  Thrice with their Wings a whizzing Consort rung  In the fourth Flight their Squadron they divide  Rank'd in two diff'rent Troops on either Side  Then two and two inspir'd with martial Rage  From either Troop in equal Pairs engage  Each Combatant with Beak and Pounces press'd  In wrathful Ire his Adversary's Breast  Each falls a Victim to preserve the Fame  Of that great Hero whence their Being came  From him their Courage and their Name they take  And as they liv'd they dye for  Memnon  's sake  Punctual to Time with each revolving Year  In fresh Array the Champion Birds appear  Again prepar'd with vengeful Minds they come  To bleed in Honour of the Souldier's Tomb  Therefore in others it appear'd not strange  To grieve for  Hecuba  's unhappy Change  But poor  Aurora  had enough to do  With her own Loss to mind another's Woe  Who still in Tears her tender Nature shews  Besprinkling all the World with pearly Dews  The VOYAGE of AENEAS  By Mr CATCOTT  Troy  thus destroy'd 'twas still deny'd by Fate  The Hopes of  Troy  should perish with the State  His Sire the

No Herbage cloath'd the Ground a ragged Flock  Of Goats halffamish'd lick'd the naked Rock  Of manly Courage and with Mind serene  Orion  's Daughters in the Town were seen  One heav'd her Chest to

tells the mournful Tale  The Story of ACIS POLYPHEMUS and GALATEA  By Mr DRYDEN  Acis  the lovely Youth whose loss I mourn  From  Faunus  and the Nymph  Symethis  born  Was both his Parents Pleasure but to me  Was all that Love could make a Lover be  The Gods our Minds in mutual Bands did join  I was his only Joy and he was mine  Now sixteen Summers the sweet Youth had seen  And doubtful Down began to shade his Chin  When  Polyphemus  first disturb'd our Joy  And lov'd me fiercely as I lov'd the Boy  Ask not which Passion in my Soul was high'r  My last Aversion or my first Desire  Nor this the greater was nor that the less  Both were alike for both were in Excess  Thee  Venus  thee both Heav'n and Earth obey  Immense thy Pow'r and boundless is thy Sway  The  Cyclops  who defy'd th' Aetherial Throne  And thought no Thunder louder than his own  The Terror of the Woods and wilder far  Than Wolves in Plains or Bears in Forests are  Th' inhuman Host who made his bloody Feasts  On mangl'd Members of his butcher'd Guests  Yet felt the force of Love and fierce Desire  And burnt for me with unrelenting Fire  Forgot his Caverns and his woolly Care  Assum'd the Softness of a Lover's Air  And comb'd with Teeth of Rakes his rugged Hair  Now with a crooked Scythe his Beard he sleeks  And mowes the stubborn Stubble of his Cheeks  Now in the Crystal Stream he looks to try  His Simagres and rowls his glaring Eye  His Cruelty and Thirst of Blood are lost  And Ships securely sail along the Coast  The Prophet  Telemus  arriv'd by chance  Where  Aetna  's Summets to the Seas advance  Who mark'd the Tracts of every Bird that flew  And sure Presages from their flying drew  Foretold the  Cyclops  that  Ulysses  ' Hand  In his broad Eye shou'd thrust a flaming Brand  The Giant with a scornful Grin reply'd  Vain Augur thou hast falsely Prophesy'd  Already Love his flaming Brand has tost  Looking on two fair Eyes my Sight I lost  Thus warn'd in vain with stalking Pace

the Seas  On either Side below the Water flows  This airy Walk the Giant Lover chose  Here on the midst he sate his Flocks unled  Their Shepherd follow'd and securely fed  A Pine so burly and of Length so vast  That sailing Ships requir'd it for a Mast  He wielded for a Staff his Steps to guide  But laid it by his Whistle while he try'd  A hundred Reeds of a prodigious Growth  Scarce made a Pipe proportion'd to his Mouth  Which when he gave it Wind the Rocks around  And watry Plains the dreadful Hiss resound  I heard the RuffianShepherd rudely blow  Where in a hollow Cave I sat below  On  Acis  ' Bosom I my Head reclin'd  And still preserve the Poem in my Mind  Oh lovely  Galatea  whiter far  Than falling Snows and rising Lilies are  More flowry than the Meads as Crystal bright  Erect as Alders and of equal height  More wanton than a Kid more sleek thy Skin  Than Orient Shells that on the Shores are seen  Than Apples fairer when the Boughs they lade  Pleasing as Winter Suns or Summer Shade  More grateful to the Sight than goodly Plains  And softer to the Touch than Down of Swans  Or Curds new turn'd and sweeter to the Taste  Than swelling Grapes that to the Vintage haste  More clear than Ice or running Streams that stray  Through Garden Plots but ah more swift than they  Yet  Galatea  harder to be broke  Than Bullocks unreclaim'd to bear the Yoke  And far more stubborn than the knotted Oak  Like sliding Streams impossible to hold  Like them fallacious like their Fountains cold  More warping than the Willow to decline  My warm Embrace more brittle than the Vine  Immoveable and fixt in thy Disdain  Rough as these Rocks and of a harder Grain  More violent than is the rising Flood  And the prais'd Peacock is not half so proud  Fierce as the Fire and sharp as Thistles are  And more outragious than a MotherBear  Deaf as the Billows to the Vows I make  And more revengeful than a trodden Snake  In Swiftness fleeter than the flying Hind  Or driven Tempests or the driving Wind  All other Faults with Patience I can bear  But Swiftness is the Vice I only fear  Yet if you knew me well you wou'd not shun  My Love but to my wish'd Embraces run  Wou'd languish in

take me dying to your deep Abodes  The  Cyclops  follow'd but he sent before  A Rib which from the living Rock he tore  Though but an Angle reach'd him of the Stone  The mighty Fragment was enough alone  To crush all  Acis  'twas too late to save  But what the Fates allow'd to give I gave  That  Acis  to his Lineage should return  And rowl among the River Gods his Urn  Straight issu'd from the

Here by the Place secur'd her Steps she stay'd  And trembling still her Lover's Form survey'd  His Shape his Hue her troubled Sense appall  And dropping Locks that o'er his Shoulders fall  She sees his Face Divine and Manly Brow  End in a Fish's wreathy Tail below  She sees and doubts within her anxious Mind  Whether he comes of God or Monster Kind  This  Glaucus  soon perceiv'd And Oh forbear  His Hand supporting on a Rock lay near  Forbear he cry'd fond Maid this needless Fear  Nor Fish am I nor Monster of the Main  But equal with the watry Gods I reign  Nor  Proteus  nor  Palaemon  me excell  Nor he whose Breath inspires the sounding Shell  My Birth 'tis true I owe to mortal Race  And I my self but late a Mortal was  Ev'n then in Seas and Seas alone I joy'd  The Seas my Hours and all my Cares employ'd  In Meshes now the twinkling Prey I drew  Now skilfully the slender Line I threw  And silent sat the moving Float to view  Not far from Shore there lies a verdant Mead  With Herbage half and half with Water spread  There nor the horned Heifers browsing stray  Nor shaggy Kids nor wanton Lambkins play  There nor the sounding Bees their Nectar cull  Nor Rural Swains their genial Chaplets pull  Nor Flocks nor Herds nor Mowers haunt the Place  To crop the Flow'rs or cut the bushy Grass  Thither sure first of living Race came I  And sat by chance my dropping Nets to dry  My scaly Prize in Order all display'd  By Number on the Greensword there I lay'd  My Captives whom or in my Nets I took  Or hung unwary on my wily Hook  Strange to behold yet what avails a Lye  I saw 'em bite the Grass as I sat by  Then sudden darting o'er the verdant Plain  They spread their Finns as in their native Main  I paus'd with Wonder struck while all my Prey  Left their new Master and regain'd the Sea  Amaz'd within my secret Self I sought  What God what Herb the Miracle had wrought  But sure no Herbs have Pow'r like this I cry'd  And strait I pluck'd some neighb'ring Herbs and try'd  Scarce had I bit and prov'd the wond'rous Taste  When strong Convulsions shook my troubled Breast  I felt my Heart grow fond of something strange  And my whole Nature lab'ring with a Change  Restless I grew and ev'ry Place forsook  And still upon the Seas I bent my Look  Farewel for ever Farewel Land I said  And plung'd amidst the Waves my sinking Head  The gentle Pow'rs who that low Empire keep  Receiv'd me as a Brother of the Deep  To  Tethys  and to  Ocean  old they pray  To purge my mortal Earthy Parts away  The watry Parents to their Suit agreed  And thrice nine times a sacred Charm they read  Then with Lustrations purify my Limbs  And bid me bathe beneath a hundred Streams  A hundred Streams from various Fountains run  And on my Head at once come rushing down  Thus far each Passage I remember well  And faithfully thus far the Tale I tell  But then Oblivion dark on all my Senses fell  Again at length my Thought reviving came  When I no longer found my self the same  Then first this Seagreen Beard I felt to grow  And these large Honours on my spreading Brow  My long descending Locks the Billows sweep  And my broad Shoulders cleave the yielding Deep  My Fishy Tail my Arms of Azure Hue  And ev'ry Part divinely chang'd I view  But what avail these useless Honours now  What Joys can Immortality bestow  What tho' our  Nereids  all my Form approve  What boots it while fair  Scylla  scorns my Love  Thus far the God and more he wou'd have said  When from his Presence flew the ruthless Maid  Stung with Repulse in such disdainful sort  He seeks  Titanian Circe  's horrid Court  The End of the Thirteenth Book  To the R  t  Hon  ble  Countess of Burlington  OVID's METAMORPHOSES BOOK XIV  Translated by Sir SAMUEL GARTH M D  The Transformation of SCYLLA  _NOW  Glaucus  with a Lover's Haste bounds o'er  The swelling Waves and seeks the  Latian  Shore  Messena    Rhegium  and the barren Coast  Of flaming  Aetna  to his Sight are lost  At length he gains the  Tyrrhene  Seas and views  The Hills where baneful Philters  Circe  brews  Monsters in various Forms around her press  As thus the God salutes the Sorceress  O  Circe  be indulgent to my Grief  And give a Lovesick Deity Relief  Too well the mighty Power of Plants I know  To those my Figure and new Fate I owe  Against  Messena  on th'  Ausonian  Coast  I  Scylla  view'd and from that Hour was lost  In tend'rest Sounds I su'd but still the Fair  Was deaf to Vows and pityless to Pray'r  If Numbers can avail exert their Pow'r  Or Energy of Plants if Plants have more  I ask no Cure let but the Virgin pine  With dying Pangs or Agonies like mine  No longer  Circe  could her Flame disguise  But to the suppliant God Marine replies  When Maids are coy have manlier Aims in view  Leave those that Fly but those that Like pursue  If Love can be by kind Compliance won  See at your Feet the Daughter of the Sun  Sooner said  Glaucus  shall the Ash remove  From Mountains and the swelling Surges love  Or humble Seaweed to the Hills repair  E'er I think any but my  Scylla  fair  Strait  Circe  reddens with a guilty Shame  And vows Revenge for her rejected Flame  Fierce Liking oft a Spight as fierce creates  For Love refus'd without Aversion hates  To hurt her hapless Rival she proceeds  And by the Fall of  Scylla    Glaucus  bleeds  Some fascinating Bev'rage now she brews  Compos'd of deadly Drugs and baneful Juice  At  Rhegium  she arrives the Ocean braves  And treads with unwet Feet the boiling Waves  Upon the Beach a winding Bay there lies  Shelter'd from Seas and shaded from the Skies  This Station  Scylla  chose a soft Retreat  From chilling Winds and raging  Cancer  's Heat  The vengeful Sorc'ress visits this Recess  Her Charm infuses and infects the Place  Soon as the Nymph wades in Her nether Parts  Turn into Dogs then at her self she starts  A ghastly Horror in her Eyes appears  But yet she knows not who it is she fears  In vain she offers from her self to run  And drags about her what she strives to shun  Oppress'd with Grief the pitying God appears  And swells the rising Surges with his Tears  From the detested Sorceress he flies  Her Art reviles and her Address denies  Whilst hapless  Scylla  chang'd to Rocks decrees  Destruction to those Barques that beat the Seas  The Voyage of AENEAS continued  Here bulg'd the Pride of fam'd  Ulysses  ' Fleet  But good  Aeneas  'scap'd the Fate he met  As to the  Latian  Shore the  Trojan  stood  And cut with welltimd Oars the foaming Flood  He weather'd fell  Charybdis  But e're long  The Skies were darken'd and the Tempest strong  Then to the  Libyan  Coast he stretches o'er  And makes at length the  Carthaginian  Shore  Here  Dido  with an hospitable Care  Into her Heart receives the Wanderer  From her kind Arms th' ungrateful Hero flies  The injur'd Queen looks on with dying Eyes  Then to her Folly falls a Sacrifice  Aeneas  now sets Sail and plying gains  Fair  Eryx  where his Friend  Acestes  reigns  First to his Sire does fun'ral Rites decree  Then gives the Signal next and stands to Sea  Outruns the Islands where  Volcano's  roar  Gets clear of  Syrens  and their faithless Shoar  But looses  Palynurus  in the Way  Then makes  Inarime  and  Prochyta  The Transformation of CERCOPIANS into Apes  The Gallies now by  Pythecusa  pass  The Name is from the Natives of the Place  The Father of the Gods detesting Lies  Oft with Abhorrence heard their Perjuries  Th' abandon'd Race transform'd to Beasts began  To mimick the Impertinence of Man  Flatnos'd and furrow'd with Grimace they grin  And look to what they were too near akin  Merry in Make and busy to no End  This Moment they divert the next offend  So much this Species of their past retains  Tho' lost the Language yet the Noise remains  AENEAS descends to Hell  Now on his Right he leaves  Parthenope    His Left  Misenus  jutting in the Sea  Arrives at  Cume  and with Awe survey'd  The Grotto of the venerable Maid  Begs Leave thro' black  Avernus  to retire  And view the muchlov'd  Manes  of his Sire  Strait the divining Virgin rais'd her Eyes  And foaming with a holy Rage replies  O thou whose Worth thy wond'rous Works proclaim  The Flames thy Piety the World thy Fame  Tho' great be thy Request yet shalt thou see  Th'  Elysian  Fields th' infernal Monarchy  Thy Parent's Shade This Arm thy Steps shall guide  To suppliant Virtue nothing is deny'd  She spoke and pointing to the Golden Bough  Which in th'  Avernian  Grove refulgent grew  Seize That She bids He listens to the Maid  Then views the mournful Mansions of the Dead  The Shade of Great  Anchises  and the Place  By Fates determin'd to the  Trojan  Race  As back to upper Light the Hero came  He thus salutes the Visionary Dame  O whether some propitious Deity  Or lov'd by those bright Rulers of the Sky  With grateful Incense I shall stile you One  And deem no Godhead greater than your own  'Twas you restor'd me from the Realms of Night  And gave me to behold the Fields of Light  To feel the Breezes of Congenial Air  And Nature's blest Benevolence to share  The Story of the SIBYLL  I am no Deity reply'd the Dame  But Mortal and religious Rites disclaim  Yet had avoided Death's tyrannick Sway  Had I consented to the God of Day  With Promises he sought my Love and said  Have all you wish my fair  Cumaean  Maid  I paus'd then pointing to a Heap of Sand  For ev'ry Grain to live a Year demand  But ah unmindful of th' Effect of Time  Forgot to covenant for Youth and Prime  The smiling Bloom I boasted once is gone  And feeble Age with lagging Limbs creeps on  Sev'n Cent'ries have I liv'd Three more fulfil  The Period of the Years to finish still  Who'll think that  Phoebus  drest in Youth Divine  Had once believ'd his Lustre less than mine  This wither'd Frame so Fates have will'd shall waste  To nothing but Prophetick Words at last  The  Sibyll  mounting now from nether Skies  And the fam'd  Ilian  Prince at  Cumae  rise  He sail'd and near the Place to Anchor came  Since call'd  Cajeta  from his Nurse's Name  Here did the luckless  Macareus  a Friend  To wise  Ulysses  his long Labours end  Here wandring  Achaemenides  he meets  And sudden thus his late Associate greets  Whence came you here O Friend and whither bound  All gave you lost on far  Cyclopean  Ground  A  Greek  's at last aboard a  Trojan  found  The Adventures of ACHAEMENIDES  Thus  Achaemenides  With Thanks I name  Aeneas  and his Piety proclaim  I 'scap'd the  Cyclops  thro' the Hero's Aid  Else in his Maw my mangled Limbs had laid  When first your Navy under Sail he found  " He rav'd till  Aetna  labour'd with the Sound  Raging he stalk'd along the Mountain's Side  And vented Clouds of Breath at ev'ry Stride  " His Staff a Mountain Ash and in the Clouds  " Oft as he walks his grisly Front he shrowds  Eyeless he grop'd about with vengeful Haste  And justled Promontories as he pass'd  Then heav'd a Rock's high Summit to the Main  And bellow'd like some bursting Hurricane  Oh cou'd I seize  Ulysses  in his Flight  How unlamented were my Loss of Sight  These Jaws should Piecemeal tear each panting Vein  Grind ev'ry crackling Bone and pound his Brain  As thus he rav'd my Joynts with Horror shook  The Tide of Blood my chilling Heart forsook  I saw him once disgorge huge Morsels raw  Of Wretches undigested in his Maw  From the pale breathless Trunks whole Limbs he tore  His Beard all clotted with o'erflowing Gore  My anxious Hours I pass'd in Caves my Food  Was Forest Fruits and Wildings of the Wood  At length a Sail I wafted and aboard  My Fortune found an hospitable Lord  Now in Return your own Adventures tell  And what since first you put to Sea befell  The Adventures of MACAREUS  Then  Macareus  There reign'd a Prince of Fame  O'er  Tuscan  Seas and  Aeolus  his Name  A Largess to  Ulysses  he consign'd  And in a Steer's tough Hide inclos'd a Wind  Nine Days before the swelling Gale we ran  The tenth to make the meeting Land began  When now the merry Mariners to find  Imagin'd Wealth within the Bag unbind  Forthwith outrush'd a Gust which backwards bore  Our Gallies to the  Laestrigonian  Shore  Whose Crown  Antiphates  the Tyrant wore  Some few commission'd were with Speed to treat  We to his Court repair his Guards we meet  Two friendly Flight preserv'd the Third was doom'd  To be by those curs'd Cannibals consum'd  Inhumanly our hapless Friends they treat  Our Men they murder and destroy our Fleet  In time the wise  Ulysses  bore away  And drop'd his Anchor in yon faithless Bay  The Thoughts of Perils past we still retain  And fear to land till Lots appoint the Men  Polites  true  Elpenor  giv'n to Wine  Eurylochus  my self the Lots assign  Design'd for Dangers and resolv'd to Dare  To  Circe  's fatal Palace we repair  The Enchantments of CIRCE  Before the spacious Front a Herd we find  Of Beasts the fiercest of the savage Kind  Our trembling Steps with Blandishments they meet  And fawn unlike their Species at our Feet  Within upon a sumptuous Throne of State  On golden Columns rais'd th'Enchantress sate  Rich was her Robe and amiable her Mein  Her Aspect awful and she look'd a Queen  Her Maids not mind the Loom nor houshold Care  " Nor wage in Needlework a  Scythian  War  But cull in Canisters disastrous Flow'rs  " And Plants from haunted Heaths and fairy Bow'rs  " With brazen Sickles reap'd at Planetary Hours  Each Dose the Goddess weighs with watchful Eye  So nice her Art in impious Pharmacy  Entring she greets us with a gracious Look  And Airs that future Amity bespoke  Her ready Nymphs serve up a rich Repast  The Bowl she dashes first then gives to taste  Quick to our own undoing we comply  Her Pow'r we prove and shew the Sorcery  Soon in a Length of Face our Head extends  Our Chine stiff Bristles bears and forward bends  A Breadth of Brawn new burnishes our Neck  Anon we grunt as we begin to speak  Alone  Eurylochus  refus'd to taste  Nor to a Beast obscene the Man debas'd  Hither  Ulysses  hastes so Fates command  And bears the pow'rful  Moly  in his Hand  Unsheaths his Scymitar assaults the Dame  Preserves his Species and remains the same  The Nuptial Rite this Outrage strait attends  The Dow'r desir'd is his transfigur'd Friends  The Incantation backward she repeats  Inverts her Rod and what she did defeats  And now our Skin grows smooth our Shape upright  Our Arms stretch up our cloven Feet unite  With Tears our weeping Gen'ral we embrace  Hang on his Neck and melt upon his Face  Twelve Silver Moons in  Circe  's Court we stay  Whilst there they waste th' unwilling Hours away  'Twas here I spy'd a Youth in  Parian  Stone  His Head a Pecker bore the Cause unknown  To Passengers A Nymph of  Circe  's Train  The Myst'ry thus attempted to explain  The Story of PICUS and CANENS  Picus  who once th'  Ausonian  Sceptre held  Could rein the Steed and fit him for the Field  So like he was to what you see that still  We doubt if real or the Sculptor's Skill  The Graces in the finish'd Piece you find  Are but the Copy of his fairer Mind  Four Lustres scarce the Royal Youth could name  Till ev'ry Lovesick Nymph confess'd a Flame  Oft for his Love the Mountain  Dryads  su'd  And ev'ry Silver Sister of the Flood  Those of  Numicus    Albula  and those  Where  Almo  creeps and hasty  Nar  o'erflows  Where sedgy  Anio  glides thro' smiling Meads  Where shady  Farfar  rustles in the Reeds  And those that love the Lakes and Homage owe  To the chaste Goddess of the Silver Bow  In vain each Nymph her brightest Charms put on  His Heart no Sov'reign would obey but one  She whom  Venilia  on Mount  Palatine    To  Janus  bore the fairest of her Line  Nor did her Face alone her Charms confess  Her Voice was ravishing and pleas'd no less  Whene'er she sung so melting were her Strains  The Flocks unfed seem'd list'ning on the Plains  The Rivers would stand still the Cedars bend  And Birds neglect their Pinions to attend  The Savage Kind in ForestWilds grow tame  And  Canens  from her heav'nly Voice her Name  Hymen  had now in some illfated Hour  Their Hands united as their Hearts before  " Whilst their soft Moments in Delights they waste  " And each new Day was dearer than the past  Ticus  would sometimes o'er the Forests rove  And mingle Sports with Intervals of Love  It chanc'd as once the foaming Boar he chac'd  His Jewels sparkling on his  Tyrian  Vest  Lascivious  Circe  well the Youth survey'd  As simpling on the flow'ry Hills she stray'd  Her wishing Eyes their silent Message tell  And from her Lap the verdant Mischief fell  As she attempts at Words his Courser springs  O'er Hills and Lawns and ev'n a Wish outwings  Thou shalt not 'scape me so pronounc'd the Dame  If Plants have Pow'r and Spells be not a Name  She saidand forthwith form'd a Boar of Air  That sought the Covert with dissembled Fear  Swift to the Thicket  Picus  wings his Way  On Foot to chase the visionary Prey  Now she invokes the Daughters of the Night  Does noxious Juices smear and Charms recite  Such as can veil the Moon's more feeble Fire  Or shade the Golden Lustre of her Sire  In filthy Fogs she hides the chearful Noon  The Guard at Distance and the Youth alone  By those fair Eyes she cries and ev'ry Grace  That finish all the Wonders of your Face  O I conjure thee hear a Queen complain  Nor let the Sun's soft Lineage sue in vain  Whoe'er thou art reply'd the King forbear  None can my Passion with my  Canens  share  " She first my ev'ry tender Wish possest  " And found the soft Approaches to my Breast  " In Nuptials blest each loose Desire we shun  " Nor Time can end what Innocence begun  " Think not she cry'd to saunter out a Life  " Of Form with that domestick Drudge a Wife  My just Revenge dull Fool e're long shall show  What Ills we Women if refus'd can do  Think me a Woman and a Lover too  " From dear successful Spight we hope for Ease  " Nor fail to Punish where we fail to Please  Now twice to East she turns as oft to West  Thrice waves her Wand as oft a Charm exprest  On the lost Youth her Magick Pow'r she tries  A loft he springs and wonders how he flies  On painted Plumes the Woods he seeks and still  The Monarch Oak he pierces with his Bill  Thus chang'd no more o'er  Latian  Lands he reigns  Of  Picus  nothing but the Name remains  The Winds from drisling Damps now purge the Air  The Mist subsides the settling Skies are fair  The Court their Sov'reign seek with Arms in Hand  They threaten  Circe  and their Lord demand  Quick she invokes the Spirits of the Air  " And Twilight Elves that on dun Wings repair  " To Charnels and th' unhallow'd Sepulcher  Now strange to tell the Plants sweat Drops of Blood  The Trees are toss'd from Forests where they stood  Blue Serpents o'er the tainted Herbage slide  Pale glaring Spectres on the  Aether  ride  Dogs howl Earth yawns rent Rocks forsake their Beds  And from their Quarries heave their stubborn Heads  The sad Spectators stiffen'd with their Fears  She sees and sudden ev'ry Limb she smears  Then each of savage Beasts the Figure bears  The Sun did now to Western Waves retire  In Tides to temper his bright World of Fire  Canens  laments her Royal Husband's Stay  " Ill suits fond Love with Absence or Delay  " Where she commands her ready People run  " She wills retracts bids and forbids anon  Restless in Mind and dying with Despair  Her Breast she beats and tears her flowing Hair  Six Days and Nights she wanders on as Chance  Directs without or Sleep or Sustenance  Tiber  at last beholds the weeping Fair  Her feeble Limbs no more the Mourner bear  Stretch'd on his Banks she to the Flood complains  And faintly tunes her Voice to dying Strains  The sick'ning Swan thus hangs her Silver Wings  And as she droops her Elegy she sings  E'er long sad  Canens  wastes to Air whilst Fame  The Place still honours with her hapless Name  Here did the tender Tale of  Picus  cease  Above Belief the Wonder I confess  Again we sail but more Disasters meet  Foretold by  Circe  to our suff'ring Fleet  My self unable further Woes to bear  Declin'd the Voyage and am refug'd Here  AENEAS arrives in ITALY  Thus  Macareus  Now with a pious Aim  Had good  Aeneas  rais'd a fun'ral Flame  In Honour of his hoary Nurse's Name  Her Epitaph he fix'd and setting Sail  Cajeta  left and catch'd at ev'ry Gale  He steer'd at Distance from the faithless Shore  Where the false Goddess reigns with fatal Pow'r  And sought those grateful Groves that shade the Plain  Where  Tyber  rouls majestick to the Main  And fattens as he runs the fair Campain  His Kindred Gods the Hero's Wishes crown  With fair  Lavinia  and  Latinus  ' Throne  But not without a War the Prize he won  Drawn up in bright Array the Battle stands  Turnus  with Arms his promis'd Wife demands  Hetrurians    Latians  equal Fortune share  And doubtful long appears the Face of War  Both Pow'rs from neighb'ring Princes seek Supplies  And Embassies appoint for new Allies  Aeneas  for Relief  Evander  moves  His Quarrel he asserts his Cause approves  The bold  Rutulians  with an equal Speed  Sage  Venulus  dispatch to  Diomede  The King late Griefs revolving in his Mind  These Reasons for Neutrality assign'd  Shall I of one poor Dotal Town possest  My People thin my wretched Country waste  An exil'd Prince and on a shaking Throne  Or risque my Patron's Subjects or my own  You'll grieve the Harshness of our Hap to hear  Nor can I tell the Tale without a Tear  The Adventures of DIOMEDES  After fam'd  Ilium  was by  Argives  won  And Flames had finish'd what the Sword begun  Pallas  incens'd pursu'd us to the Main  In Vengeance of her violated Fane  Alone  Oilëus  forc'd the  Trojan  Maid  Yet all were punish'd for the brutal Deed  A Storm begins the raging Waves run high  The Clouds look heavy and benight the Sky  Red Sheets of Light'ning o'er the Seas are spread  Our Tackling yields and Wrecks at last succeed  'Tis tedious our disast'rous State to tell  Ev'n  Priam  wou'd have pity'd what befell  Yet  Pallas  sav'd me from the swallowing Main  At home new Wrongs to meet as Fates ordain  Chac'd from my Country I once more repeat  All Suff'rings Seas could give or War compleat  For  Venus  mindful of her Wound decreed  Still new Calamities should past succeed  Agmon  impatient thro' successive Ills  With Fury Love's bright Goddess thus reviles  These Plagues in spight to  Diomede  are sent  " The Crime is his but ours the Punishment  " Let each my Friends her puny Spleen despise  " And Dare that haughty Harlot of the Skies  The rest of  Agmon  's Insolence complain  And of Irreverence the Wretch arraign  About to answer his blaspheming Throat  Contracts and shrieks in some disdainful Note  To his new Skin a Fleece of Feather clings  Hides his late Arms and lengthens into Wings  The lower Features of his Face extend  Warp into Horn and in a Beak descend  Some more experience  Agmon  's Destiny  And wheeling in the Air like Swans they fly  These thin Remains to  Daunus  ' Realms I bring  And here I reign a poor precarious King  The Transformation of APPULUS  Thus  Diomedes Venulus  withdraws  Unsped the Service of the common Cause  Puteoli  he passes and survey'd  A Cave long honour'd for its awful Shade  Here trembling Reeds exclude the piercing Ray  " Here Streams in gentle Falls thro' Windings stray  " And with a passing Breath cool Zephyrs play  The Goatherd God frequents the silent Place  As once the WoodNymphs of the Sylvan Race  Till  Appulus  with a dishonest Air  And gross Behaviour banish'd thence the Fair  The bold Buffoon whene'er they tread the Green  Their Motion mimicks but with Gests obscene  Loose Language oft he utters but e're long  A Bark in filmy Network binds his Tongue  Thus chang'd a base wild Olive he remains  " The Shrub the Coarseness of the Clown retains  The TROJAN Ships transform'd to SeaNymphs  Mean while the  Latians  all their Pow'r prepare  'Gainst Fortune and the Foe to push the War  With  Phrygian  Blood the floating Fields they stain  But short of Succours still contend in vain  Turnus  remarks the  Trojan  Fleet ill mann'd  Unguarded and at Anchor near the Strand  He thought and strait a lighted Brand he bore  And Fire invades what 'scap'd the Waves before  The Billows from the kindling Prow retire  Pitch Rosin Searwood on red Wings aspire  And  Vulcan  on the Seas exerts his Attribute of Fire  This when the Mother of the Gods beheld  Her tow'ry Crown she shook and stood reveal'd  Her brindl'd Lions rein'd unveil'd her Head  And hov'ring o'er her favour'd Fleet she said  Cease  Turnus  and the heav'nly Pow'rs respect  Nor dare to violate what I protect  These Gallies once fair Trees on  Ida  stood  And gave their Shade to each descending God  Nor shall consume irrevocable Fate  Allots their Being no determin'd Date  Strait Peals of Thunder Heav'n's high Arches rend  The Hailstones leap the Show'rs in Spouts descend  The Winds with widen'd Throats the Signal give  The Cables break the smoaking Vessels drive  Now wondrous as they beat the foaming Flood  The Timber softens into Flesh and Blood  The Yards and Oars new Arms and Legs design  A Trunk the Hull the slender Keel a Spine  The Prow a female Face and by Degrees  The Gallies rise green Daughters of the Seas  " Sometimes on coral Beds they sit in State  Or wanton on the Waves they fear'd of late  The Barks that beat the Seas are still their Care  Themselves remembring what of late they were  To save a  Trojan  Sail in Throngs they press  But smile to see  Alcinous  in Distress  Unable were those Wonders to deter  The  Latians  from their unsuccessful War  Both Sides for doubtful Victory contend  And on their Courage and their Gods depend  Nor bright  Lavinia  nor  Latinus  ' Crown  Warm their great Soul to War like fair Renown  Venus  at last beholds her Godlike Son  Triumphant and the Field of Battle won  Brave  Turnus  slain strong  Ardea  but a Name  " And bury'd in fierce Deluges of Flame  " Her Tow'rs that boasted once a Sov'reign Sway  " The Fate of fancy'd Grandeur now betray  A famish'd Heron from the Ashes springs  And beats the Ruin with disast'rous Wings  Calamities of Towns distrest she feigns  And oft with woful Shrieks of War complains  The Deification of AENEAS  Now had  Aeneas  as ordain'd by Fate  Surviv'd the Period of  Saturnia  's Hate  And by a sure irrevocable Doom  Fix'd the immortal Majesty of  Rome  Fit for the Station of his Kindred Stars  His Mother Goddess thus her

Eyes  Thy Brother's Kingdoms of the nether Skies  Forthwith a Conclave of the Godhead meets  Where  Juno  in the shining Senate sits  Remorse for past Revenge the Goddess feels  Then thund'ring  Jove  th' Almighty Mandate seals  Allots the Prince of his Celestial Line  An  Apothëosis  and Rights Divine  The chrystal Mansions eccho with Applause  And with her Graces Love's bright Queen withdraws  Shoots in a Blaze of Light along the Skies  And born by Turtles to  Laurentum  flies  Alights where thro' the Reeds  Numicius  strays  And to the Seas his watry Tribute pays  The God she supplicates to wash away  The Parts more gross and subject to Decay  And cleanse the Goddessborn from Seminal Allay  The horned Flood with glad Attention stands  Then bids his Streams obey their Sire's Commands  His better Parts by Lustral Waves refin'd  More pure and nearer to Aetherial Mind  With Gums of fragrant Scent the Goddess strews  And on his Features breathes ambrosial Dews  Thus deify'd new Honours

 Be then fair Nymph by these Examples led  Nor shun for fancy'd Fears the Nuptial Bed  Not she for whom the  Lapithites  took Arms  Nor  Sparta  's Queen could boast such heav'nly Charms  And if you would on Woman's Faith rely  None can your Choice direct so well as I  Tho' old so much  Pomona  I adore  Scarce does the bright  Vertumnus  love her more  'Tis your fair self alone his Breast inspires  With softest Wishes and unsoyl'd Desires  Then fly all vulgar Followers and prove  The God of Seasons only worth your Love  On my Assurance well you may repose  Vertumnus  scarce  Vertumnus  better knows  True to his Choice all looser Flames he flies  " Nor for new Faces fashionably dies  The Charms of Youth and ev'ry smiling Grace  Bloom in his Features and the God confess  Besides he puts on ev'ry Shape at Ease  But those the most that best  Pomona  please  Still to oblige her is her Lover's Aim  Their Likings and Aversions are the same  Nor the fair Fruit your burthen'd Branches bear  Nor all the youthful Product of the Year  Could bribe his Choice your self alone can prove  A fit Reward for so refin'd a Love  Relent fair Nymph and with a kind Regret  Think 'tis  Vertumnus  weeping at your Feet  A Tale attend thro'  Cyprus  known to prove  How  Venus  once reveng'd neglected Love  The Story of IPHIS and ANAXARETE  Iphis  of vulgar Birth by Chance had view'd  Fair  Anaxaretè  of  Teucer  's Blood  Not long had he beheld the Royal Dame  E're the bright Sparkle kindled into Flame  Oft did he struggle with a just Despair  Unfix'd to ask unable to forbear  " But Love who flatters still his own Disease  " Hopes all things will succeed he knows will please  Wheree'er the fair one haunts he hovers there  And seeks her Confident with Sighs and Pray'r  Or Letters he conveys that seldom prove  " Successless Messengers in Suits of Love  Now shiv'ring at her Gates the Wretch appears  And Myrtle Garlands on the Columns rears  Wet with a Deluge of unbidden Tears  The Nymph more hard than Rocks more deaf than Seas  Derides his Pray'rs insults his Agonies  Arraigns of Insolence th' aspiring Swain  And takes a cruel Pleasure in his Pain  Resolv'd at last to finish his Despair  He thus upbraids th' inexorable Fair  O  Anaxaretè  at last forget  " The Licence of a Passion indiscreet  Now Triumph since a welcome Sacrifice  Your Slave prepares to offer to your Eyes  My Life without Reluctance I resign  That Present best can please a Pride like Thine  But O forbear to blast a Flame so bright  Doom'd never to expire but with the Light  And you great Pow'rs do Justice to my Name  The Hours you take from Life restore to Fame  Then o'er the Posts once hung with Wreaths he throws  The ready Cord and fits the fatal Noose  For Death prepares and bounding from above  At once the Wretch concludes his Life and Love  E're long the People gather and the Dead  Is to his mourning Mother's Arms convey'd  First like some ghastly Statue she appears  Then baths the breathless Coarse in Seas of Tears  And gives it to the Pile now as the Throng  Proceed in sad Solemnity along  To view the passing Pomp the cruel Fair  Hastes and beholds her breathless Lover there  Struck with the sight inanimate she seems  Set are her Eyes and motionless her Limbs  Her Features without Fire her Colour gone  And like her Heart she hardens into Stone  In  Salamis  the Statue still is seen  In the fam'd Temple of the  Cyprian  Queen  Warn'd by this Tale no longer then disdain  O Nymph belov'd to ease a Lover's Pain  So may the Frosts in Spring your Blossoms spare  And Winds their rude Autumnal Rage forbear  The Story oft  Vertumnus  urg'd in vain  But then assum'd his heav'nly Form again  Such Looks and Lustre the bright Youth adorn  As when

Translated by Mr DRYDEN and Others  The PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY  By Mr DRYDEN  _A KING is sought to guide the growing State  One able to support the Publick Weight  And fill the Throne where  Romulus  had sate  Renown which oft bespeaks the Publick Voice  Had recommended  Numa  to their Choice  A peaceful pious Prince who not content  To know the  Sabine  Rites his Study bent  To cultivate his Mind to learn the Laws  Of Nature and explore their hidden Cause  Urg'd by this Care his Country he forsook  And to  Crotona  thence his Journey took  Arriv'd he first enquir'd the Founder's Name  Of this new Colony and whence he came  Then thus a Senior of the Place replies  Well read and curious of Antiquities  'Tis said  Alcides  hither took his way  From  Spain  and drove along his conquer'd Prey  Then leaving in the Fields his grazing Cows  He sought himself some hospitable House  Good  Croton  entertain'd his Godlike Guest  While he repair'd his weary Limbs with Rest  The Hero thence departing bless'd the Place  And here he said in Time's revolving Race  A rising Town shall take his Name from thee  Revolving Time fulfill'd the Prophecy  For  Myscelos  the justest Man on Earth  Alemon  's Son at  Argos  had his Birth  Him  Hercules  arm'd with his Club of Oak  O'ershadow'd in a Dream and thus bespoke  Go leave thy Native Soil and make Abode  Where  Aesaris  rowls down his rapid Flood  He said and Sleep forsook him and the God  Trembling he wak'd and rose with anxious Heart  His Country Laws forbad him to depart  What shou'd he do 'Twas Death to go away  And the God menac'd if he dar'd to stay  All Day he doubted and when Night came on  Sleep and the same forewarning Dream begun  Once more the God stood threatning o'er his Head  With added Curses if he disobey'd  Twice warn'd he study'd Flight but wou'd convey  At once his Person and his Wealth away  Thus while he linger'd his Design was heard  A speedy Process form'd and Death declar'd  Witness there needed none of his Offence  Against himself the Wretch was Evidence  Condemn'd and destitute of human Aid  To him for whom he suffer'd thus he pray'd  O Pow'r who hast deserv'd in Heav'n a Throne  Not giv'n but by thy Labours made thy own  Pity thy Suppliant and protect his Cause  Whom thou hast made obnoxious to the Laws▪  A Custom was of old and still remains  Which Life or Death by Suffrages ordains  White Stones and Black within an Urn are cast  The first absolve but Fate is in the last  The Judges to the common Urn bequeath  Their Votes and drop the Sable Signs of Death  The Box receives all Black but pour'd from thence  The Stones came candid forth the Hue of Innocence  Thus  Alemonides  his Safety won  Preserv'd from Death by  Alcumena  's Son  Then to his KinsmanGod his Vows he pays  And cuts with prosp'rous Gales th'  Ionian  Seas  He leaves  Tarentum  favour'd by the Wind  And  Thurine  Bays and  Temises  behind  Soft  Sybaris  and all the Capes that stand  Along the Shore he makes in sight of Land  Still doubling and still coasting till he found  The Mouth of  Aesaris  and promis'd Ground  Then saw where on the Margin of the Flood  The Tomb that held the Bones of  Croton  stood  Here by the Gods Command he built and wall'd  The Place predicted and  Crotona  call'd  Thus Fame from time to time delivers down  The sure Tradition of th'  Italian  Town  Here dwelt the Man divine whom  Samos  bore  But now Selfbanish'd from his Native Shore  Because he hated Tyrants nor cou'd bear  The Chains which none but servile Souls will wear  He tho' from Heav'n remote to Heav'n cou'd move▪  With Strength of Mind and tread th' Abyss above  And penetrate with his interior Light  Those upper Depths which Nature hid from Sight  And what he had observ'd and learnt from thence▪  Lov'd in familiar Language to dispence  The Crowd with silent Admiration stand  And heard him as they heard their God's Command  While he discours'd of Heav'n's mysterious Laws  The World's Original and Nature's Cause  And what was God and why the fleecy Snows  In Silence fell and rattling Winds arose  What shook the stedfast Earth and whence begun  The Dance of Planets round the radiant Sun  If Thunder was the Voice of angry  Jove    Or Clouds with Nitre pregnant burst above  Of these and Things beyond the common Reach  He spoke and charm'd his Audience with his Speech  He first the Taste of Flesh from Tables drove  And argu'd well if Arguments cou'd move  O Mortals from your Fellows Blood abstain  Nor taint your Bodies with a Food profane  While Corn and Pulse by Nature are bestow'd  And planted Orchards bend their willing Load  While labour'd Gardens wholsom Herbs produce  And teeming Vines afford their gen'rous Juice  Nor tardier Fruits of cruder Kind are lost  But tam'd with Fire or mellow'd by the Frost  While Kine to Pails distended Udders bring  And Bees their Hony redolent of Spring  While Earth not only can your Needs supply  But lavish of her Store provides for Luxury  A guiltless Feast administers with Ease  And without Blood is prodigal to please  Wild Beasts their Maws with their slain Brethren fill  And yet not all for some refuse to kill  Sheep Goats and Oxen and the nobler Steed  On Browz and Corn and flow'ry Meadows feed  Bears Tygers Wolves the Lyon's angry Brood  Whom Heav'n endu'd with Principles of Blood  He wisely sundred from the rest to yell  In Forests and in lonely Caves to dwell  Where stronger Beasts oppress the Weak by Might  And all in Prey and purple Feasts delight  O impious Use to Nature's Laws oppos'd  Where Bowels are in other Bowels clos'd  Where fatten'd by their Fellow's Fat they thrive  Maintain'd by Murder and by Death they live  'Tis then for nought that Mother Earth provides  The Stores of all she shows and all she hides  If Men with fleshy Morsels must be fed  And chaw with bloody Teeth the breathing Bread  What else is this but to devour our Guests  And barb'rously renew  Cyclopean  Feasts  We by destroying Life our Life sustain  And gorge th' ungodly Maw with Meats obscene  Not so the Golden Age who fed on Fruit  Nor durst with bloody Meals their Mouths pollute  Then Birds in airy Space might safely move  And tim'rous Hares on Heaths securely rove  Nor needed Fish the guileful Hooks to fear  For all was peaceful and that Peace sincere  Whoever was the Wretch and curs'd be he  That envy'd first our Food's Simplicity  Th' Essay of bloody Feasts on Brutes began  And after forg'd the Sword to murder Man  Had he the sharpen'd Steel alone employ'd  On Beasts of Prey that other Beasts destroy'd  Or Man invaded with their Fangs and Paws  This had been justify'd by Nature's Laws  And Selfdefence But who did Feasts begin  Of Flesh he stretch'd Necessity to Sin  To kill Mankillers Man has lawful Pow'r  But not th' extended Licence to devour  Ill Habits gather by unseen Degrees  As Brooks make Rivers Rivers run to Seas  The Sow with her broad Snout for rooting up  Th'intrusted Seed was judg'd to spoil the Crop  And intercept the sweating Farmer's Hope  The covet'ous Churl of unforgiving Kind  Th' Offender to the bloody Priest resign'd  Her Hunger was no Plea For that she dy'd  The Goat came next in order to be try'd  The Goat had cropt the Tendrills of the Vine  In vengeance Laity and Clergy join  Where one had lost his Profit one his Wine  Here was at least some Shadow of Offence  The Sheep was sacrific'd on no Pretence  But meek and unresisting Innocence  A patient useful Creature born to bear  The warm and woolly Fleece that cloath'd her Murderer  And daily to give down the Milk she bred  A Tribute for the Grass on which she fed  Living both Food and Rayment she supplies  And is of least Advantage when she dies  How did the toiling Oxe his Death deserve  A downright simple Drudge and born to serve  O Tyrant with what Justice canst thou hope  The Promise of the Year a plenteous Crop  When thou destroy'st thy lab'ring Steer who till'd  And plough'd with Pains thy else ungrateful Field  From his yet reeking Neck to draw the Yoke  That Neck with which the surly Clods he broke  And to the Hatchet yield thy Husbandman  Who finish'd Autumn and the Spring began  Nor this alone but Heav'n it self to bribe  We to the Gods our impious Acts ascribe  First recompence with Death their Creatures Toil  Then call the Bless'd above to share the Spoil  The fairest Victim must the Pow'rs appease  So fatal 'tis sometimes too much to please  A purple Fillet his broad Brows adorns  With flow'ry Garlands crown'd and gilded Horns  He hears the murd'rous Pray'r the Priest prefers  But understands not 'tis his Doom he hears  Beholds the Meal betwixt his Temples cast  The Fruit and Product of his Labours past  And in the Water views perhaps the Knife  Uplifted to deprive him of his Life  Then broken up alive his Entrails sees  Torn out for Priests t'inspect the Gods Decrees  From whence O mortal Men this Gust of Blood  Have you deriv'd and interdicted Food  Be taught by me this dire Delight to shun  Warn'd by my Precepts by my Practice won  And when you eat the welldeserving Beast  Think on the Lab'rer of your Field you feast  Now since the God inspires me to proceed▪  Be that whate'er inspiring Pow'r obey'd  For I will sing of mighty Mysteries  Of Truths conceal'd before from human Eyes  Dark Oracles unveil and open all the Skies  Pleas'd as I am to walk along the Sphere  Of shining Stars and travel with the Year  To leave the heavy Earth and scale the Height  Of  Atlas  who supports the heav'nly Weight  To look from upper Light and thence survey  Mistaken Mortals wandring from the Way  And wanting Wisdom fearful for the State  Of future Things and trembling at their Fate  Those I wou'd teach and by right Reason bring  To think of Death as but an idle Thing  Why thus affrighted at an empty Name  A Dream of Darkness and fictitious Flame  Vain Themes of Wit which but in Poems pass  And Fables of a World that never was  What feels the Body when the Soul expires  By Time corrupted or consum'd by Fires  Nor dies the Spirit but new Life repeats  In other Forms and only changes Seats  Ev'n I who these mysterious Truths declare  Was once  Euphorbus  in the  Trojan  War  My Name and Lineage I remember well  And how in Fight by  Sparta  's King I fell  In  Argive Juno  's Fane I late beheld  My Buckler hung on high and own'd my former Shield  Then Death so call'd is but old Matter dress'd  In some new Figure and a vary'd Vest  Thus all Things are but alter'd nothing dies  And here and there th' unbody'd Spirit flies  By Time or Force or Sickness dispossest  And lodges where it lights in Man or Beast  Or hunts without till ready Limbs it find  And actuates those according to their Kind  From Tenement to Tenement is toss'd  The Soul is still the same the Figure only lost  And as the soften'd Wax new Seals receives  This Face assumes and that Impression leaves  Now call'd by one now by another Name  The Form is only chang'd the Wax is still the same  So Death so call'd can but the Form deface  Th'immortal Soul flies out in empty Space  To seek her Fortune in some other Place  Then let not Piety be put to flight  To please the Taste of Glutton Appetite  But suffer inmate Souls secure to dwell  Lest from their Seats your Parents you expel  With rabid Hunger feed upon your Kind  Or from a Beast dislodge a Brother's Mind  And since like  Typhis  parting from the Shore  In ample Seas I sail and Depths untry'd before  This let me further add That Nature knows  No stedfast Station but or Ebbs or Flows  Ever in Motion she destroys her old  And casts new Figures in another Mold  Ev'n Times are in perpetual Flux and run  Like Rivers from their Fountain rowling on  For Time no more than Streams is at a Stay  The flying Hour is ever on her Way  And as the Fountain still supplies her Store  The Wave behind impels the Wave before  Thus in successive Course the Minutes run  And urge their Predecessor Minutes on  Still moving ever new For former Things  Are set aside like abdicated Kings  And every moment alters what is done  And innovates some Act till then unknown  Darkness we see emerges into Light  And shining Suns descend to Sable Night  Ev'n Heav'n it self receives another Dye  When weary'd Animals in Slumbers lie  Of Midnight Ease Another when the Gray  Of Morn preludes the Splendor of the Day  The Disk of  Phoebus  when he climbs on high  Appears at first but as a bloodshot Eye  And when his Chariot downward drives to Bed  His Ball is with the same Suffusion red  But mounted high in his Meridian Race  All bright he shines and with a better Face  For there pure Particles of  Aether  flow  Far from th'Infection of the World below  Nor equal Light th'unequal Moon adorns  Or in her wexing or her waning Horns  For ev'ry Day she wanes her Face is less  But gath'ring into Globe she fattens at Increase  Perceiv'st thou not the Process of the Year  How the four Seasons in four Forms appear  Resembling human Life in ev'ry Shape they wear  Spring first like Infancy shoots out her Head  With milky Juice requiring to be fed  Helpless tho' fresh and wanting to be led  The green Stem grows in Stature and in Size  But only feeds with Hope the Farmer's Eyes  Then laughs the childish Year with Flowrets crown'd  And lavishly perfumes the Fields around  But no substantial Nourishment receives  Infirm the Stalks unsolid are the Leaves  Proceeding onward whence the Year began  The Summer grows adult and ripens into Man  This Season as in Men is most repleat  With kindly Moisture and prolifick Heat  Autumn succeeds a sober tepid Age  Not froze with Fear nor boiling into Rage  More than mature and tending to Decay  When our brown Locks repine to mix with odious Grey  Last Winter creeps along with tardy Pace  Sour is his Front and furrow'd is his Face  His Scalp if not dishonour'd quite of Hair  The ragged Fleece is thin and thin is worse than bare  Ev'n our own Bodies daily Change receive  Some Part of what was theirs before they leave  Nor are toDay what Yesterday they were  Nor the whole Same toMorrow will appear  Time was when we were sow'd and just began  From some few fruitful Drops the Promise of a Man  Then Nature's Hand fermented as it was  Moulded to Shape the soft coagulated Mass  And when the little Man was fully form'd  The breathless Embrio with a Spirit warm'd  But when the Mother's Throws begin to come  The Creature pent within the narrow Room  Breaks his blind Prison pushing to repair  His stiffled Breath and draw the living Air  Cast on the Margin of the World he lies  A helpless Babe but by Instinct he cries  He next essays to walk but downward press'd  On four Feet imitates his Brother Beast  By slow Degrees he gathers from the Ground  His Legs and to the rowling Chair is bound  Then walks alone a Horseman now become  He rides a Stick and travels round the Room  In time he vaunts among his youthful Peers  Strongbon'd and strung with Nerves in Pride of Years  He runs with Mettle his first merry Stage  Maintains the next abated of his Rage  But manages his Strength and spares his Age  Heavy the third and stiff he sinks apace  And tho' 'tis downhill all but creeps along the Race  Now sapless on the Verge of Death he stands  Contemplating his former Feet and Hands  And  Milo  like his slacken'd Sinews sees  And wither'd Arms once fit to cope with  Hercules    Unable now to shake much less to tear the Trees  So  Helen  wept when her too faithful Glass  Reflected on her Eyes the Ruins of her Face  Wondring what Charms her Ravishers cou'd spy  To force her twice or ev'n but once t'enjoy  Thy Teeth devouring Time thine envious Age  On Things below still exercise your Rage  With venom'd Grinders you corrupt your Meat  And then at lingring Meals the Morsels eat  Nor those which Elements we call abide  Nor to this Figure nor to that are ty'd  For this eternal World is said of Old  But four prolifick Principles to hold  Four different Bodies two to Heav'n ascend  And other two down to the Center tend  Fire first with Wings expanded mounts on high  Pure void of Weight and dwells in upper Sky  Then Air because unclog'd in empty Space  Flies after Fire and claims the second Place  But weighty Water as her Nature guides  Lies on the lap of Earth and Mother Earth subsides  All Things are mix'd of these which all contain  And into these are all resolv'd again  Earth rarifies to Dew expanded more  The subtil Dew in Air begins to soar  Spreads as she flies and weary of her Name  Extenuates still and changes into Flame  Thus having by degrees Perfection won  Restless they soon untwist the Web they spun  And Fire begins to lose her radiant Hue  Mix'd with gross Air and Air descends to Dew  And Dew condensing does her Form forego  And sinks a heavy lump of Earth below  Thus are their Figures never at a stand  But chang'd by Nature's innovating Hand  All Things are alter'd nothing is destroy'd  The shifted Scene for some new Show employ'd  Then to be born is to begin to be  Some other Thing we were not formerly  And what we call to Die is not t'appear  Or be the Thing that formerly we were  Those very Elements which we partake  Alive when Dead some other Bodies make  Translated grow have Sense or can Discourse  But Death on deathless Substance has no Force  That Forms are chang'd I grant that nothing can  Continue in the Figure it began  The golden Age to Silver was debas'd  To Copper that our Mettal came at last  The Face of Places and their Forms decay  And that is solid Earth that once was Sea  Seas in their Turn retreating from the Shore  Make solid Land what Ocean was before  And far from Strands are Shells of Fishes found  And rusty Anchors fix'd on MountainGround  And what were Fields before now wash'd and worn  By falling Floods from high to Valleys turn  And crumbling still descend to level Lands  And Lakes and trembling Bogs are barren Sands  And the parch'd Desart floats in Streams unknown  Wondring to drink of Waters not her own  Here Nature living Fountains opes and there  Seals up the Wombs where living Fountains were  Or Earthquakes stop their ancient Course and bring  Diverted Streams to feed a distant Spring  So  Lycus  swallow'd up is seen no more  But far from thence knocks out another Door  Thus  Erasinus  dives and blind in Earth  Runs on and gropes his way to second Birth  Starts up in  Argos  Meads and shakes his Locks  Around the Fields and fattens all the Flocks  So  Mysus  by another way is led  And grown a River now disdains his Head  Forgets his humble Birth his Name forsakes  And the proud Title of  Caicus  takes  Large  Amenane  impure with yellow Sands  Runs rapid often and as often stands  And here he threats the drunken Fields to drown  And there his Dugs deny to give their Liquor down  Anigros  once did wholsome Draughts afford  But now his deadly Waters are abhorr'd  Since hurt by  Hercules  as Fame resounds  The Centaurs in his Current wash'd their Wounds  The Streams of  Hypanis  are sweet no more  But brackish lose the Taste they had before  Antissa    Pharos    Tyre  in Seas were pent  Once Isles but now increase the Continent  While the  Leucadian  Coast main Land before  By rushing Seas is sever'd from the Shore  So  Zancle  to th'  Italian  Earth was ty'd  And Men once walk'd where Ships at Anchor ride  Till  Neptune  overlook'd the narrow Way  And in Disdain pour'd in the conqu'ring Sea  Two Cities that adorn'd th'  Achaian  Ground  Buris  and  Helice  no more are found  But whelm'd beneath a Lake are sunk and drown'd  And Boatsmen through the Chrystal Water show  To wond'ring Passengers the Walls below  Near  Traezen  stands a Hill expos'd in Air  To Winterwinds of leafy Shadows bare  This once was level Ground But strange to tell  Th' included Vapours that in Caverns dwell  Lab'ring with Cholick Pangs and close confin'd  In vain sought Issue for the rumbling Wind  Yet still they heav'd for Vent and heaving still  Inlarg'd the Concave and shot up the Hill  As Breath extends a Bladder or the Skins  Of Goats are blown t'inclose the hoarded Wines  The Mountain yet retains a Mountain's Face  And gather'd Rubbish heals the hollow Space  Of many Wonders which I heard or knew  Retrenching most I will relate but few  What are not Springs with Qualities oppos'd  Endu'd at Seasons and at Seasons lost  Thrice in a Day thine  Ammon  change their Form  Cold at high Noon at Morn and Evening warm  Thine  Athaman  will kindle Wood if thrown  On the pil'd Earth and in the waning Moon▪  The  Thracians  have a Stream if any try  The Taste his harden'd Bowels petrify  Whate'er it touches it converts to Stones  And makes a Marble Pavement where it runs  Crathis  and  Sybaris  her Sister Flood  That slide through our  Calabrian  Neighbour Wood  With Gold and Amber dye the shining Hair  And thither Youth resort for who would not be Fair  But stranger Virtues yet in Streams we find  Some change not only Bodies but the Mind  Who has not heard of  Salmacis  obscene  Whose Waters into Women soften Men  Or  Aethiopian  Lakes which turn the Brain  To Madness or in heavy Sleep constrain  Clytorian  Streams the Love of Wine expel  Such is the Virtue of th' abstemious Well  Whether the colder Nymph that rules the Flood  Extinguishes and balks the drunken God  Or that  Melampus  so have some assur'd  When the mad  Proetides  with Charms he cur'd  And pow'rful Herbs both Charms and Simples cast  Into the sober Spring where still their Virtues last  Unlike Effects  Lyncestis  will produce  Who drinks his Waters tho' with moderate Use  Reels as with Wine and sees with double Sight  His Heels too heavy and his Head too light  Ladon  once  Pheneos  an  Arcadian  Stream  Ambiguous in th' Effects as in the Name  By Day is wholsome Bev'rage but is thought  By Night infected and a deadly Draught  Thus running Rivers and the standing Lake  Now of these Virtues now of those partake  Time was and all Things Time and Fate obey  When fast  Ortygia  floated on the Sea  Such were  Cyanean  Isles when  Typhis  steer'd  Betwixt their Streights and their Collision fear'd  They swam where now they sit and firmly join'd  Secure of rooting up resist the Wind  Nor  Aetna  vomiting sulphureous Fire  Will ever belsh for Sulphur will expire  The Veins exhausted of the liquid Store  Time was she cast no Flames in time will cast no more  For whether Earth's an Animal and Air  Imbibes her Lungs with Coolness to repair  And what she sucks remits she still requires  Inlets for Air and Outlets for her Fires  When tortur'd with convulsive Fits she shakes  That Motion choaks the Vent till other Vent she makes  Or when the Winds in hollow Caves are clos'd  And subtil Spirits find that Way oppos'd  They toss up Flints in Air the Flints that hide  The Seeds of Fire thus toss'd in Air collide  Kindling the Sulphur till the Fewel spent  The Cave is cool'd and the fierce Winds relent  Or whether Sulphur catching Fire feeds on  Its unctuous Parts till all the Matter gone  The Flames no more ascend for Earth supplies  The Fat

And o'er the craggy Rocks the rattling Chariot drew  In vain to stop the hotmouth'd Steeds I try'd  And bending backward all my Strength apply'd  The frothy Foam in driving Flakes distains  The Bits

Entrails crackle as they fry  And boding Fumes pronounce a Mystery  Soon as the Augur saw the Holy Fire  And Victims with presaging Signs expire  To  Cippus  then he turns his Eyes with speed  And

they implore the God with fervent Vows  His salutary Power to interpose  And end a great afflicted City's Woes  The holy Temple sudden Tremors proved  The Laurelgrove and all its Quivers moved  In

With Storms of Hail were mingled Drops of Blood  A dusky Hue the Morning Star o'erspread  And the Moon's Orb was stain'd with Spots of Red  In every place portentous Shricks were heard  The fatal Warnings of th' infernal Bird  In every Place the Marble melts to Tears  While in the Groves rever'd thro' length of Years  Boding and awful Sounds the Ear invade  And solemn Music warbles thro' the
