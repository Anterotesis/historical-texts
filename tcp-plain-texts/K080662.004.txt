been visited by travellers in which it has not been noticed In Britain it was formerly held in high estimation not only because its flesh was accounted a delicacy at the tables of the nobility  It appears from a curious book entitled  The Regulations of the Houshold of the Fifth Earl of  NORTHUMBERLAND  begun in  that Herons were valued at the same price as  Bytters  Bitterns  Fessaunts  Pheasants  Curlewes  Curlews and  Peacockes  Peacocks  "At PRINCIPAL FEASTSItem it is thought in likewyze that HEARONSEWYS be bought for my  Lordees own mees  so that they be at xiid a pece" The price of the Crane was d at the same time and the Goose d or at most d  Partridges  d  Woodcocks  or ½ and  Snipes  three for a penny  but because Heron Hawking was a favourite diversion insomuch that laws were enacted for the preservation of the species and any person by destroying the eggs incurred a penalty of twenty shillings  The plumage of the male bird is remarkable for its elegance per∣haps we could with less propriety use the same expression if speaking of its general appearance and proportions Nature has not provided it with webbed feet to swim after its prey which is almost wholly of the aquatic kind but has furnished it with very long legs to wade after it and these give it rather an aukward appearance when standing on the land The neck also is long and slender but when it stands on the side of a stream or river waiting for the passing of a fish its neck and head are drawn between the shoulders in flying its neck is also crouched down and the head almost concealed between the shoulders The male is chiefly distinguished from the female by having a fine crest of black feathers two in particular in some specimens are eight  inches in length Mr Latham believes that this appendage is found only in males of a full age or perhaps very old birds Mr Pennant says that the long soft black feathers on the sides were used in old times as egrets for the hair or ornaments to the caps of knights of the garter and the crests of the males are now used as ornaments in the East  The female has only a very short plume of dusky greyish feathers and the loose feathers that hang over the breast are very short while those of the other sex are long This has been generally supposed a distinct kind the accurate Linneus described it as another species under the specific name  cinerea  and many other naturalists have been of the same opinion as appears by the synonyms Mr Pennant ob∣serves this was formerly supposed "but later observations prove them to be the same" Mr Latham adopts precisely the opinion of Mr Pennant but in neither of their accounts can we find the au∣thority on which that opinion is founded It is worthy of remark that Albin who lived at a time when Heronries were far more nu∣merous than at present though even now they are very common in some parts  "At  Cres  Hall  near  Gos  er  in  Lincolnshire  I have counted eighty nests in one tree"  Pennant  in the first volume of his Birds has figured the male and in the third volume the female yet gives not the smallest reason to conclude that he did not consider them as distinct species  In the breeding season they unite in large societies and build on the highest trees The nest is made of sticks and lined with rushes wool feathers c They lay four five or six eggs of a pale green colour They desert the nests in the winter and are then found on the banks of rivers or marshy places  The length is about three feet breadth five feet weight exceeds three pounds  PLATE LXXIV STERNA

wing coverts and vent are white and in some specimens of the common kind the white at the vent is spread towards the thighs The webs of the feet are depressed and form a crescent the colour of the legs seem to vary our bird had scarcely any of the red tinge in the black colour  These birds frequent our shores in summer Latham says they are observed on the coasts of Kent in a few days after the other terns and as they differ somewhat in their manners do not associate They are found during spring and summer in vast numbers in the fens of Lincolnshire The eggs are three or four in number of a greenish or olive colour spotted with black and have also a band of the same colour about the middle These eggs are deposited among the reeds in fens and other marshy places The food is in∣sects and small fish which it procures by hovering over the water and darting on its prey in the same manner as most other birds of the same genus  It is an inhabitant of most of the northern countries of Europe very common in Siberia and about the salt lakes of the desarts of Tartary It is also supposed to be the species which was seen by  Kalm  in vast flocks beyond lat north long W He says "It was rather darker than the common seaswallow the flocks consisted of some hundreds and sometimes settled on the ship  Vide  Kalm  Travels in North America c translated by J R Forster  "  PLATE LXXV

seems undetermined whether we ought to consider this as a dis∣tinct species or only as a variety of the Sky Lark Mr Latham in his Synopsis considers it a variety and observes that he is aware of this and other Birds becoming black by feeding on  Hempseed  as was the case with a Goldfinch and House Sparrow It appears also liable to much variation of colours in different specimens One in  the British Museum is of a full deep black throughout and that from which the figure in our plate is copied is of a lighter colour in many parts than that seems to have been from which Albin engraved his plate The account which this Author has given is curious "This Lark" says he "was taken with a clap net by one of the Birdcatchers in a field near  Highgate  and brought to me by  Mr Davenport  which I have taken care to draw exactly from the Bird neither adding nor diminishing in the draught or colouring This being a curiosity I was desired by one of my subscribers to make a plate of it"  The name Albin has given it is scarcely justified by this descrip∣tion which he has added "The bill of this Bird was of a dusky yellow the irides of the eyes yellowish it was all over of a dark reddish brown inclining to black excepting the hind part of the head on which was some dusky yellowish feathers likewise some feathers with whitish edges on the belly"  Our specimen was shot in Scotland by Mr

substance known by the name of  Star Shot  or  Star Gelly  owes its origin to this bird or some of the kind being nothing but the half digested remains of EarthWorms on which these birds feed and often discharge them from their stomachs  Mr Morton in the  Nat Hist Northampt  has given also the fol∣lowing curious observation"In the course of my correspondence with the late Mr  J Platt  of  Oxford  I recollect his having men∣tioned that once meeting with a lump of this  starjelly  on examina∣tion he found the toes of a  Frog  or  Toad  still adhering and undis∣solved and from thence

Creuzmeise  Kram    Tannen Meise Pine Titmouse  Frisch    It has been supposed by some authors that the Parus Ater and Parus Palustris  Marsh Titmouse  of Linnaeus were not distinct species but merely the two sexes of one kind and others have thought the latter only a variety of the first Willughby is the first author worthy of con∣sideration who has noticed the precise difference between the two birds He says the Marsh Titmouse differs from the Colemouse in these particulars st that it is bigger d that it wants the white spot on the head d it has a larger tail th its under side is white th it has less black under the chin th it wants the white spot on the covert of the wings Mr Pennant observes on this account given by Willughby that the last distinction does not hold in ge∣neral as the subject figured in the  British Zoology  had those spots yet wanted that on the hind part of the head  The opinion of Mr Latham in this particular deserves attention also he says "it is much to be feared that the Marsh Titmouse is not a distinct species most probably a mere variety of the Cole∣mouse"  Gen Syn vol    In the  Supplement  to the  General Synopsis of Birds  Mr Latham has added the following account under the head MARSH TITMOUSE "In my  Synopsis  it has not appeared clear to me whether the  Cole∣mouse  and this were different species I find it to be the opinion of  Sepp  that they form but one being both figured in the same plates as  male  and  female  In one of them is a spot of white on the hind head and the sides of the head are white the throat black The other has the top of the head wholly black and the black spot of the throat wanting The nest seems here composed of sedge mixed with large  cat'stail  lined with down and feathers furnished with five white eggs mottled with red brown  The Colemouse appears to be less injurious in gardens and orchards than others of the same genus it is also less numerous and generally inhabits woods The length is four inches

most frequent in the pine forests in Russia Siberia and Kamtschatka it is also found in Germany where it is more common than in any other part of Europe though it inhabits the mountainous parts of Sweden and Denmark it sometimes visits France in flocks Found also in North America  In its manners it is said to greatly resemble the Jay It feeds on the kernels of the pine wild berries and insects

  The Nuthatch is a small bird it weighs about one ounce and is five inches and three quarters in length The female differs from the male only in size the weight seldom exceeding five or six drams  It breeds in the hollows of trees and lays six or seven eggs of a dirty white colour dotted with rufous these are deposited on the rotten wood mixed with a little moss If the entrance to the nest is too large it closes up part of it with clay leaving only a very small hole to creep through The nest of this bird is seldom dis∣turbed or the eggs taken away when the female is sitting for her hissing so nearly resembles that of a snake that few would venture to put their hands into the hole to search for them and it is said that the female will suffer her feathers to be plucked off rather than  desert her eggs or young The male also shews the greatest tender∣ness for them and its mate during the time of incubation  It feeds on all kinds of insects as well as nuts of the latter it lays up a considerable hoard in the hollows of trees and brings them out when other food is scarce The manner of its cracking the nut is curious and has been noticed by several authors and par∣ticularly  Willoughby  he says "It is a pretty sight to see her fetch a nut out of her hoard when placing it fast in a chink she stands above it with the head downwards and striking it with all her force breaks the shell and catches up the kernel"  In its manners it is not unlike the Woodpecker tribe It is not supposed to sleep perched for when confined in a cage it would creep into a corner at night to sleep Dr Plott says "this bird by putting its bill into a crack in the bough of a tree can make such a violent sound as if it was rending asunder so that the noise may be heard at least twelve score yards"  It is not migratory but changes its situation in winter Pennant observes that it makes a chattering noise in Autumn Latham says he has been informed that it has at times a whistle like that of a man  PLATE LXXXII MOTACILLA PHOENICURUS REDSTART PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils oval broad naked  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bill strait slender Tongue jagged  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  AND  SYNONYMS

light blue colour and in other respects resembling those of the Hedge Sparrow except that they are rather more elongated at the smallest end This bird is so very shy that if the eggs are only touched it forsakes the nest entirely  The Redstart is rather smaller than the Redbreast measuring about five inches The male is known by the chin cheeks and throat being black in the female the chin is white and the red colour of the breast is paler than in the male It has one very peculiar habit  when it shakes its tail it does not move it up and down like the Wagtail but horizontally or sideways like a Dog when he is fawning Its note is soft and pleasing but it will not bear confinement in a cage unless when reared from nestlings when it requires the same treatment as the Nightingale In the wild

by any author and seems to have given Linnaeus some trouble to determine to what genus he should assign it for though it has the tongue of the Woodpecker as well as the situation of the toes the bill is too weak for that genus Linnaeus in the former edition of the  Fauna Suecica  placed it with the Cuckow but it appears to be the opinion of later naturalists that it should form a distinct genus his new genus having been generally adopted The  Jyngi Congener  Le Torcol rayé of  Brisson  of Aldravendus is certainly no other than a variety  The colours are altogether very plain but are so beautifully varied and pencilled that as Mr Pennant observes Nature has made ample amends for their want of splendor The colours are paler in the female than the male  This bird builds in hollow trees  Latham  says they make no nest but lay the eggs on the bare rotten wood  Pennant  says it makes the nest of dry grass The eggs according to  Buffon  are as white as ivory and  Pennant  adds that they are so thin that the yolk may be seen through them The number of eggs seldom exceed nine  The Wryneck is supposed to be a Bird of passage appearing in the spring eight or ten days earlier than the Cuckow It feeds on Insects and seems particularly fond of Ants these the extreme length of the tongue enables it to pick out of the cracks where they are concealed It takes its name from a habit it has of turning its head back to the shoulders when alarmed or terrified it can also erect the feathers of the head like those of a JayWeight of this Bird is one ounce and a quarter length seven inches

very scarce the second is not common and the last is extremely rare so that we have little opportunity to notice the singular manners of this tribe Nature seems to have allotted more than an ordinary share of courage to these little creatures they equal the eagle in the fierceness of their attacks on smaller birds and defend themselves against those they cannot overcome with the greatest vigour and resolution Though in this respect they imitate the larger carnivorous birds they have not like them claws strong enough to tear their prey to pieces but to supply this defect they fasten it on a thorn and pull it asunder with their bill Even when confined in a cage it is said that they treat their food in a similar manner sticking it against the wires be∣fore they eat it  We now speak of the manners generally peculiar to the tribe how far those of the Wood Chat accord with them we can only presume from being of the same genus no English naturalist having yet been so fortunate as to meet with it since  Willoughby  and  Ray  Pennant has not given a figure of it in the British Zoology and it is a fact well known that both Lewin and Walcot have given figures of it drawn from mere descriptions this is the more to be regretted as no specimen of it was either in the Leverian or British Museums and that eminent ornithologist Mr Latham with his accustomed candour acknowledges in his account of it that he has never seen it "Mr  Pennant  " says he "does not describe this bird from his  own  inspection and I must confess that it has never come under  mine  " He also says  Buffon  does not speak of it as uncommon but gives it as his opinion that the redbacked Shrike is a variety of this species as well as some other kinds he mentions and adds that from his own observation he cannot deny the fact We have com∣pared them and do not hesitate to give them as two distinct species  It is only the male bird that we have in our possession We must own ourselves indebted for the following description of the female to Pennant and Latham nor are we certain that our specimen was shot in England but rather suspect that it came from GermanyThe length is seven inches and three

this bird that it was perhaps the  Motacilla Sylvia  of Linnaeus or that certainly it differed very little from it Mr Pennant also seems undetermined whether the White Throat was the  M Sylvia  of Linnaeus though Berkenhout  Outlines of Nat Hist  gives it as that species without hesitation The opinion of Mr Latham is of the most importance and if it does not positively confirm our bird being the true  M Sylvia  of Linnaeus it proves at least that the  White Throat  is not that bird as has been generally supposed  "That Linnaeus's bird is not our  White Throat  I believe is manifest both

to be extinct in Ireland and in Scotland is found only in the Highlands north of Inverness  Rossshire Sutherlandshire  Mr Latham says the last bird  of this kind found in Scotland was in  Chicholm  's great forest in Strathglass  Albin gave a figure of it in his Ornithology published sixty years since and then he seems not to have known that it was a British species he calls it the Mountain Cock from Muscovy From this we may infer that the breed was nearly extirpated half a century ago  According to most authors it thrives best in cold countries It is found in Italy but only in the higher regions where the air is bleak In Russia it is not uncommon particularly in the Asiatic part of that empire There is a variety of this species much smaller than the common sort which is probably owing to the severe cold of the climate in which it lives being found in Lapland and Norway the farthest extreme of Europe towards the Icy Sea  The male of this species is two feet nine inches in length breadth four feet and is as large as a Turkey  In Scotland it is known by the name of  Capercalze Avercalze  and in the old law books Caperkally the last signifying the  horse of the woods  In Germany it is called Aurhan or Urus  Wild Ox Cock  Pennant  The female is smaller twenty six inches in length The bill is dusky throat red neck and back marked with transverse bars of red and black a few

black and pale reddish brown the scapulars tipped with white the inner webs of the quills dusky the exterior mottled with pale brown the tail of a deep rust colour barred with black and tipped with white  These birds feed on many kinds of plants and particularly on the tender shoots and seeds of the Pine and Fir trees which are in the greatest plenty in the forests they frequent The males never associate with the females except from the beginning of February till the end of March when the male perches on a tree with his tail spread the quills lowered to the feet the neck protruded and the feathers of the head ruffled In this posture it makes a loud and shrill noise like the whetting of a scythe and this it repeats till the females dis∣cover its haunts They lay from eight to sixteen eggs of a white colour spotted with yellow and larger than those of the common hen these are deposited upon moss on the ground  Mr Latham says of the last bird of this kind shot in Scotland "I am well in∣formed that the nest was placed on a Scotch Pine"  The females only sit the whole time of incubation and cover the eggs with dry leaves when she is compelled to leave them The young run after the mother as soon as hatched  The flesh of the Wood Grous is much esteemed except when it feeds on the berries of Juniper which communicates a very unpleasant taste to it  PLATE XC STRIX PASSERINA LITTLE

in falconry in this country particularly in daring of Larks and other small birds It is said that the Larks never venture to take their flight in sight of this bird but that if it hovers over them they will remain motionless on the ground while the fowler draws a net over them  We find on comparing the different descriptions given by authors of this bird with specimens that have fallen under our observation that few birds vary more in the colours of their plumage than the Hobby in some the back is reddish or deep brown in others almost black with a bluish cast Again we find some with the back throughout of a very deep lead colour and others with the edges of the feathers of a pale yellowbrown The breast is generally of a pure white with dark spots but these also vary the white is tinged with a faint dirtybrown in some and the spots incline to brown instead of black in others The irides are brown of every shade in different birds  one author  M Brisson  says they are yellow Some of these variations we must presume depend on the age of the bird but one circumstance has been noticed in adult specimens that deserves particular notice the vent and thighs which are generally ferruginous or rufous are sometimes white Mr Latham speaking of this variation says he has a specimen in which the thighs are dusky white longitudinally marked with brown and the vent of a plain white

artful manner The nest is placed at the bottom of some bush or under a stone and usually con∣tains five or six eggs of a pale greenish colour with marks of rufous  The trivial English name of this bird has been accounted for by Mr Latham in a very curious manner he says he cannot find it remarked any where for its having any song  Buffon  compares its note to the word  ouistrata  frequently

Mr Latham has given this species a place in his list of the Birds of Great Britain and we cannot surely incur disapprobation by follow∣ing his example If the authority of Mr Latham is unsupported by the opinion of Mr Pennant we must recollect that the Zoology of the latter author appeared many years before the  Synopsis  of Mr Latham and probably the species was not so generally diffused and domesticated in this country before the British Zoology was published as since that period It is impossible that we can account otherwise for what reason he excluded it since he has given the  Peacock Phea∣sant Guinea Hen  and other domesticated Birds of foreign extraction which certainly had no better claim to his attention in that work than the beautiful Bird before us  This species is a native of Africa particularly of the Cape of Good Hope from the latter place vast numbers have been brought to this country and the climate favouring their increase the kind is not uncommon in many parts of the kingdom It is rather an or∣namental than useful species and is generally kept in Gentlemen's ponds for pleasure  Albin published a figure and description of this Bird from a speci∣men reared in this country sixty years ago he says it fed on grass and corn like other Geese and thus concludes his observations on the two sexes "The difference between the cock and hen could not be distinguished neither by the colours or shape but only by the cock's running to the hen with open wings clasping or embracing her round with them I could not find any other name for them from the Poulterers but

shall be accused of flattering its appearance by a gaudy introduction of unnatural tints in the annexed figure to avoid such imputation we have strictly observed and ac∣curately expressed the colours from a specimen in our collection that had been taken in a state of nature We are aware that the colours will vary in different specimens of every species but by cor∣rectly representing one that is perfect it will convey a better idea of the bird than any of the mutilated creatures kept in cages for amusement  The tail of the Magpie is particularly remarkable its colours are more splendid than any other part of the bird its form is like a wedge the two middle feathers eleven inches long the rest decrease gradually the outermost being only five inches and an half The principal colour produced by reflection on the black part of the body is fine blue or purple the first tint is very vivid on the wings The  finest green is the predominant colour of the tail which changes in the folds to reddish yellow with a gilded hue fine brown blue purple and shades of glossy black throughout These colours cannot be seen at a distance because they are produced only by the light falling in a particular direction and all the bright glosses assimilate with the blacker hues when the bird is removed far from the eye of the spectator  It would be tedious to enlarge on the pecular habits of a bird that is familiar to every rustic inhabitant in the kingdom In all its actions it discovers a degree of instinct superior to most birds In many respects it resembles the crow like that creature it feeds in∣discriminately on every kind of food Insects grain small birds or their eggs carrion and even young poultry Sometimes it procures its food by stratagem at others by annoying larger animals when it has no danger to apprehend from them It is often seen perched on the back of a Sheep or a Cow picking off the Insects that infest them In this respect we allow them to be useful but if they re∣lieve the poor animals from their smaller enemies they subject them to their own uncontroulable insolence and sometimes pick out the eyes of animals that attempt to resist them In a domestic state it is often taught to repeat words or sentences It does not imitate the human voice with the same facility and propriety as the parrot but sufficiently distinct to be understood  Its great share of instinct is clearly demonstrated by the situation and manner in which the nest is built it is placed conspicuously on the top of some tree or in a hawthorn bush but is always fenced below by brambles and other thick bushes that make it difficult of access The nest is composed of thorny twigs well interwoven and has the  thorns sticking outwards it is lined with wool feathers and roots and is plaistered within with fine mud It is defended above by a thorny covering and has an entrance just large enough to admit the bird The Magpie lays six or seven eggs of a greenish colour spotted with

the same colour The young males leave the female parent in the beginning of winter and keep in flocks of six or eight till spring They are very quarrelsome and fight like gamecocks  PLATE XCVIII ARDEA

  Kleiner Weisser Rager  Kram    Amongst the number of curious and elegant species that have been extirpated in this country the English Naturalist will most regret the loss of this bird It was formerly very common and its flesh much admired It formed a part of many of the old English feasts and amongst others that recorded by Leland which was given by George Nevell archbishop of York in the reign of Edward the Fourth alone included  "one thousand Egrittes"  At this time it is consi∣dered such a rarity that Mr Pennant observes in his Appendix to the British Zoology "We once received out of  Anglesea  the feathers of a bird shot there which we suspect to be the Egret this is the only instance perhaps of its being found in our country" The same author adds in another part "We have never met with this bird or the Crane in England but formed our descriptions from specimens in the elegant cabinet of Dr Mauduit in Paris"  In some foreign countries it is still very common is found in several parts of Europe and Asia it is also said to be found in Africa and on the American continent  The weight of this bird is one pound the length about eleven inches the appendage of loose feathers which is situated on the back and hang over the rump were anciently used to decorate caps or head pieces and hence the ornament to a cap in later times was called an aigrette  PLATE XCIX

and never visits the southern parts of Great Britain except in severe winters Living chiefly at sea it is taken with much dif∣ficulty If pursued when swimming it dives under the water and does not appear again till it is at a considerable distance from its pursuers It is often caught under water by a hook baited with small fish Willoughby says they are sometimes taken in this manner sixty feet under water  Being rarely seen on land it has been believed that it never quitted the water and that it hatched its young in a hole formed by nature under the wing Naturalists have discovered its nest among  reeds  and  flags  in the water where it is kept continually wet as in some of the Grebe genus  This species is larger than the common goose the length is about twentyfive inches The male is said to be distinguished by a few brown specks on the side of the neck and by having the colours throughout more defined than in the female some authors have however considered the supposed females as birds not in an adult state  PLATE C ALCEDO ISPIDA KINGSFISHER PICAE  Bill compressed convex  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bill triangular thick strait long Tongue short sharp  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  AND  SYNONYMS

needless to remark that this bird is esteemed the most beautiful of the feathered race that inhabits the south of Europe In its form it is rather inelegant but its colours are fine throughout the azure of its back is exceedingly bright and when the creature is hovering in the air in a fine day it appears resplendent in the highest degree  The absurd fictions that poets in the vigour of their imagi∣nation have formed concerning this bird have particularly in∣clined naturalists to examine its manners of life with attention The poets placed it in a floating nest during the time of incubation and endowed it with power to calm the adverse winds and seas  Aristotle  and  Pliny  tell us that this bird is most common in the seas of Sicily that it sat only a few days and those in the depth of  winter and during that period the mariner might fail in full secu∣rity for which reason they were styled  Halcyon days  Pennant  Among the moderns its flesh has been thought unperishable and capable of preserving woollen and other vestments from decay and it has also been supposed to turn its breast to the north when hung up dead  Specimens of this bird are brought from almost every part of the world in England it is not uncommon it frequents the sides of running streams and takes its prey which consists entirely of fish by darting on it in the water It makes no nest but lays seven or more beautiful transparent white eggs in a large hole in the bank of a river or stream  INDEX TO VOL IV ARRANGEMENT ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM OF LINNAEUS  ORDER I ACCIPITRES  FALCO SUBBUTEO Plate  FALCO

grateful sentiments the Author cannot conclude the Fourth Volume of this Work without expressing his sincere acknowledgments to the Public for the favourable manner in which it has been received From the encourage∣ment which has attended it in the course of publication he presumes that the expectations of the Subscribers have not been disappointed in any part of it and it is particularly pleasing to find the concluding numbers have given the utmost satisfaction  The Author would have been happy if he could have promised at the commencement of this Work to present a complete History of British Ornithology but being aware of the difficulty of procuring some of the rare  Aborigines  of the Country and fearful of displeasing many Subscribers by introducing others that are familiar to every one he con∣ceived it would be most advisable to select only those which were particularly interesting to the English Naturalist or Country Gentleman these including all the Birds formerly known in Great Britain together with those rare migratory Species that are sometimes found even in the interior of the Country  As far as the prescribed limits of the Work would admit the Author hopes he has fulfilled this promise to the Public If he has excluded some fine Birds such as the Goldfinch the Bullfinch the Pheasant and its varieties with others no less beautiful it was to reserve a place for some that were scarcely known to exist in the Country The  Rosecoloured Ouzel  Roller Little Bittern  and  Golden Oriole  are of this descrip∣tion and to these we may add the  Egret Cock of the Wood Black Cock Black Woodpecker  and  Waxen Chatterer  The  Wood Chat  which English authors have figured from mere descriptions sufficiently mark the attention of the Author to render this Work no less respectable than useful The  Rednecked Grebe Northern Diver Water Ouzel Dartford War∣bler Dusky Lark Longlegged Plover  with many others equally rare and interesting having been procured purposely for this Work evidently prove that no expence has been spared to make it complete  Since the one hundred Plates have been engraved some rare Birds have come into the Author's possession but rather than incur the imputation of trespassing on the public favour he declined adding them to the Work until it appeared to be the wishes of the Subscribers to have a Sup∣plement that being to be added at their request the Public may be persuaded that every exertion will be made to render it worthy of their approbation  The distinguished manner in which Works of Natural History are encouraged at this period leads us to a few re∣flections which it is presumed are not entirely inapplicable to the present Work and may be some apology for the different publications of that description which the Author has lately submitted to the Public  It is a noble sentiment of the British Nation to be no less respected for their learning than admired for their valour by other nations yet it is a truth which national pride dare not conceal that several sciences and those especially of Natural History have been more successfully cultivated  by our continental neighbours than by ourselves The study of those sciences unfold too many advantages to civilized society to be entirely overlooked in any country and some of its branches have ever found admirers in courts and patrons in princes but it is not in every country that a number of less exalted individuals are disposed to afford them that encouragement which alone can evince the general taste of a nation  The devastations of war have indeed materially checked many learned enquiries in other countries whilst the English nation by its fostering protection have contributed much to their improvement This may ultimately excite a laudable emulation in this country to equal or excel others in the knowledge of those sciences for surely it is not to our credit that learned foreigners are well acquainted with the natural productions even of our country while we remain ignorant of them  The Author of this Work had formerly conceived that an Epitome at least of the Natural History of Great Britain would be acceptable to many and this is now in forwardness to completion Botany the most useful and pleasing branch has been in part illustrated already in a manner that re∣flects honour on its Authors The mineral fossil and ma∣rine productions are probably less generally known The Insects and Birds the Author has endeavoured to illustrate and he hopes his exertions have not been unsuccessful  The inimitable beauty and variety both of structure and colours which distinguish the natural productions of warmer regions will always obtrude on the attention of European Naturalists and agreeably diversify a study that without  such auxiliary aid might seem less interesting yet we may observe that to become well acquainted with exotic Natural History it is necessary to examine that of Europe In England like other northern countries Nature assumes a grave aspect but yet presents an unbounded source of amusement and information to the intelligent mind and must merit the inquiries of learned men who are inclined to promote knowledge or feel an interest in the credit of the country  Whoever has devoted much leisure to the study of Natural History will be surprized at the inconsiderable number of learned works on that subject that are in the English lan∣guage and of those it may be said as Edwards in  Essays on Natural History  remarks that what we have are mostly translations from other languages This is not however the only blame the artists of our country have been condemned for pirating their figures from the works of foreign authors and it must be owned this has been too frequently practised Since Edwards wrote his book Botany and Ornithology have undergone great improvements and the latter in particular by the writings of Pennant but more especially by Latham who having added the information of preceding authors to a correct description of each Bird seemed to leave little wanting of a complete British Ornithology but a series of accurately coloured Figures of the different Species To supply this deficiency in particular has been the aim of the Author of this Work and he trusts the Selection of rare Species that he has included in it will facilitate the study of that important and amusing branch of Natural History
