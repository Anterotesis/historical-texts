Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country  M DCCXL  THE LIFE OF Sir  Walter Ralegh  _THO' Abundance of solid Particulars are naturally sunk in the rapid Current of Time while many less substantial are floating upon the Surface to the Hand of every ordinary Memorialist And though some shining Circumstances in the prosperous Part of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Life have been darkened through Envy as others in the unfortunate Period through Interest by the Age in which he lived nevertheless his single Life may perhaps be found more fruitful of memorable Incidents than many Histories of intire Ages Insomuch as I may be apprehensive with a late Collector of his Memoirs  "That the describing a Person of so diffusive a Praise so equally great in so many different Parts of Life will be like attempting a Landskip from a high Hill where the Multiplicity and Extent of the Prospects may rather distract the Mind  than direct it and call for Judgment to restrain the Fancy which is apt to run Riot when employed upon too many Objects"  Many Guides may indeed appear to lead us through this Wilderness but numerous as the Authors are who mention him they contain but Fragments of his Story divers whereof hitherto widely dispersed have escaped not only our general Historians but the many Compilers of distinct Pieces on his Actions Even the Moderns who have treated of him with Impartiality have yet been deficient in point of Industry so as to prove no less injurious to his Merits than some who in his own Age conspired to depreciate them Hence the Generality having been too superficial and undigested having neither regarded due Choice and Order of Matter Proportion in the Parts or Connexion of the whole nor yet discharged themselves by such References to proper Vouchers as might satisfy those Readers it is my Ambition to please I have esteemed the Number of such Writers no Discouragement to the Revival of his Story  And first for the Name of  Ralegh  otherwise written  Rale  and  Ralega  in some old Deeds I have formerly seen it is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom since there are some Villages and Towns in the West as well as other Parts so called which might at first receive their Denomination from some as well as afterwards give it to others who were Natives or Possessors thereof And since we are credibly informed that one of those Districts belonged antiently to noble Lords of the same Name as also that several of them were so called from the very Family we are to speak of And as the  Raleghs  of  Devonshire  will appear to have flourished there before the Conquest they might be the Progenitors of those in other Countries as it is expresly intimated out of the  Records they were of those in  Warwickshire  But as we are also told of no less than five Knights of this Name at one Time differently situated in that Western County before mentioned and that there were three great Families so named also there contemporary with Sir  Walter Ralegh  's who bore Arms different from those of his paternal Coat we may conclude they were not all of one Lineage and at the same Time that it is owing to the Eminency of this great Man that a Distinction of the several Houses and his in particular when all but his were in a Manner extinct has been so elaborately endeavoured by the Antiquaries and Genealogists of his own Time  As to the Family of Sir  Walter Ralegh  therefore in particular it is generally agreed on that  Smalridge  in the Parish of  Axminster  in the County of  Devon  was one of their most ancient Seats But Sir  William Pole  who is said to have been one of the greatest Searchers into the Antiquities of that Country has been singularly short in the Time of their first settling there However if we should agree with him upon that Person for Sir  Walter Ralegh  's direct Ancestor who first removed thither out of  NettlecombRalegh  in  Somersetshire  in the Reign of King  Henry  III from whom there is a successive Descent of those six Knights Sir  Wimond  In a Visitationbook made  anno  of the Counties of  Wilts Dorset  and  Somerset  among the MS Collections of  Brown Willis  Esq of  Whaddon Hall  in  Bucks  there is a Pedigree of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Family from the Reign of King  John  with a Copy whereof that worthy Antiquary having obliged me I find this  Wymond  in the Time of King  Henry  III is therein called Lord of  Coliton  and  Nettlecomb  So it may seem the Estate in  Somersetshire  was of latter Accession to the Family and that in  Devonshire  the more ancient Seat or that the Removal was made rather to the former than the latter County  Sir  Hugh  Sir  John  Sir  Peter  and two Sir  Johns  more besides others who were either  of the same Degree themselves or married into Families distinguish'd with it even down to  Wimond  the Grandfather of Sir  Walter Ralegh  I know not but it may be also allowed that the Honours of this Pedigree were sufficient to have been boasted of by some of his Traducers For tho' in the Eye of Heraldry many Titles are accounted more noble than Knighthood tho' native and patrimonial Dignities or such as descend necessarily from Father to Son may in the Eye of the common lineal Claimant appear most legitimate and such as are venal be esteemed in that of the Wealthy most valuable yet those which are personal the individual Acquisition or Recompence of every Man's proper Merit will in the Eye of Reason be held most honourable  John Hooker  a famous Antiquary  Mr  Hooker  who was the first Chamberlain of  Exeter  about and twice Member of Parliament for that City as we find in the  Notitia Parliamentaria  by  Brown Willis  Esq vol p as also for  Athenry  in  Ireland  about as I find by his own Words did actually set forth in Print his Tracts about the Government of  Exeter  and Bishops of that  See  besides his Augmentations of the  English  and  Irish  Chronicles with other Pieces before or by the Year and having lived to near eighty Years died in according to  Anthony Wood  and my said Author  Prince  in his Life though the former of them quotes from  Hooker  's own Words that he was living in if 'tis not a Mistake of the Press and the latter has made no Boggle at the Blunder  in one of his Performances gives us to understand that  Smalridge  was in the Possession of the  Raleghs  before the  Norman  Conquest and that one of the Family being taken Prisoner by the  Gauls  did for his Deliverance upon St  Leonard  's Day build at his Return home a Chapel there consecrated to that Saint and therein as a grateful Monument hung up his Target the Records of which Foundation are said to have been given by a Priest of  Axminster  to Sir  Walter Ralegh  as their most rightful  Owner  Hooker  's  Synopsis Chronographical  or historical Record of  Devonshire  a MS as quoted by  Prince  fol A Copy whereof in this Author's Time was in the custody of Mr  John Eastchurch  of  Wood  in that County still extant as I have heard in those Parts and Pity it is that it has not yet seen the publick Light since above a hundred Years ago it was revis'd by so able a Judge of its Worth as Sir  John Dodderidge  and had his Recommendation to the Press  So much for the Antiquity of the Family in  Devonshire  and as for its Derivation the said  Hooker  even in a printed Dedication to Sir  Walter Ralegh  as I hinted which he repeatedly confirms in the aforesaid Performance not only avouches his Alliance to the  Courtenays  Earls of  Devon  and other illustrious Houses but traces the Stream of Consanguinity up to the Kings of  England  where he says  That one of his Ancestors in the directest Line Sir  John de Ralegh  of  Fardel  another Seat of their ancient Inheritance in the Parish of  Cornwood  eight Miles East of  Plymouth  espoused the Daughter of Sir  Roger D'Amerei  who married  Elizabeth  Daughter of  Gilbert  Earl of  Gloucester  by  Joan D'Acres  Daughter of King  Edward I  which  Gilbert  was descended of  Robert  Earl of  Gloucester  Son of King  Henry I So goes up to the Conqueror and farther adds  That in like Manner he may be derived by his Mother also out of the same House  But since these two Authors the likeliest we have in Print to have confirm'd us in the Truth of this Matter vary thus from each other since Sir  William Pole  thought it rather another Family of the  Raleghs  which was thus royally descended since also five or six ancient Pedigrees of this Family which I have seen in Manuscript by the heraldical Visitors and Antiquaries of those western Parts also differ not only from  Hooker  but in several Points both from Sir  William Pole  and from one another and lastly since it will be consider'd that I have not undertaken to account for the whole  Race of the  Raleghs  but only one select Person of the Name here let the Truth as to these remote Ancestors or Alliances hover for me for I am not moved on the Wings of Conjecture to make myself a Party with any of those Antiquaries nor shall endeavour to compromise the Difference between them unless such prevailing Authorities had occurr'd as would enable me to do it with Certanity Besides as those whose Virtues have adorned them with a Sufficiency of  personal  Honours are ever least anxious about such as are  relative  so it might well argue but little  Weight  in the Judgment of a Historian to shew himself contentious about these  Feathers  for his Worthy especially such a one as shall be found to have thought so justly  light  of them himself  However as all Accounts allow him a very honourable Extract let us prefer which we please the Freedom some great Courtiers took in calling him  Jack  and  Upstart  upon his Advancement to Queen  Elizabeth  's Favour is thought to have somewhat reflected rather on themselves in suffering their sprightly Parts to take such Advantage of their noble Principles One of these Sarcasms I find recorded by Lord  Bacon  in his little Book of  Apophthegms  where he says  "That when Queen  Elizabeth  had advanced  Ralegh  she was one Day playing on the Virginals and my Lord of  Oxford  with another Nobleman stood by when it happen'd that the Ledge before the Jacks was taken away so that they were seen whereupon that Lord and the other Nobleman smil'd and whisper'd a little the Queen mark'd it and would needs know  what was the Matter  His Lordship answer'd  They laugh'd to see that when  Jacks  went up  Heads  went down  "  Tho' the Application of this Reflection particularly to  Ralegh  if such was made is disputable notwithstanding  Lord  Bacon  's Allusion yet it is plain that Sir  Robert Naunton  who was Secretary of State at the Time of  Ralegh  's Death and whose  Observations  on that Queen's  Favourites  were written though not printed before those  Apophthegms  thought also that it was made upon  Ralegh  for he has said with Relation to this Jest by that witty Earl  "We all know it savours more of Emulation and his Humour than of Truth it being a certain Note of the Times that the Queen in her Choice never took into her Favour a mere new Man or a Mechanick"  But it is believ'd Sir  Walter Ralegh  himself was afterwards pretty even with his  Qualitycritics  where he so solidly exposes the Emptiness of Merit nay the real Detriment to it in Posterity's being entitled to the Rewards of their Ancestor's Virtues by  hereditary  Honours Succession of  Blood  and Nobility in  Parchment those only being truly  noble  who by worthy Acts have render'd themselves most  notable  All therefore that needs be added on this Head as a Matter more immediately requisite and indeed sufficient for my present Purpose is That Sir  Walter Ralegh  was the Son of  Walter Ralegh  Esq of  Fardel  aforesaid who being thrice married had by his first Wife  Joan  Daughter of  John Drake  of  Exmouth  in  Devon  Esq two Sons one named  George  and the other  John  which last married  Anne  the Daughter of Sir  Bartholomew Fortescue  of  Filley  in  Devon  and Relict of  Gaicrick  of  Ford  and they had Issue His second Wife was Daughter of one  Darell  of  London  by whom he had a Daughter named  Mary  who was married to  Hugh Snedale  of  Hilling  in  Cornwall  Esq and had Issue His third Wife was  Catherine  Daughter of Sir  Philip Champernon  of  Modbury  and Relict of  Otho Gilbert  of  Compton  in  Devon  Esq He had by this last  Venter  his third Son  Carew  afterwards  knighted and of  Wiltshire  who married  Dorothy  Daughter of Sir  William Wroughton  and Relict of Sir  John Tbynn  by whom he had Issue and lastly his fourth Son named  Walter  the Subject of our ensuing Discourse who was thereby the  uterine  Brother of those three eminent Knights Sir  John  Sir  Humphry  and Sir  Adrian Gilbert  By this last Wife Mr  Ralegh  had also one Daughter named  Margaret  who was married first to  Radford  of  Mount Radford  in  Devon  Clerk of the Peace and afterwards to  Hull  of  Larkebre  Esq in St  Leonard  's Parish  Exeter  The Family was indeed at this Time much declin'd from its former Splendor of Fame and Affluence of Fortune for the Estate of  Smalridge  which remain'd in the Name of  Ralegh  to the Time of King  Henry  VIII was then sold by Sir  Walter  's Grandfather  Wimond  to  John  the Father of Sir  John Gilbert  of  Compton  but I cannot find it reduc'd to that low Ebb in the latter Respect which some have intimated for  Fardel  remained still in their Possession which after the Death of Sir  Walter  's Father sell to the eldest Son  George  and there were besides  Widdycomb Ralegh  and  ColitonRalegh  in their Possession the former of which was sold by Sir  Walter  's elder Brother Sir  Carew Ralegh  to  George  the natural Son of  George  aforesaid and the latter was sold by Sir  Walter  himself to  Richard Martin  or his Father of  Exeter  But neither of these Places claim the Honour of his Birth  For his Father having the Remainder of a fourscoreyears Lease in a pleasant Farm call'd  Hayes  situate in the Parish of  Budley  in that Part of  Devonshire  bordering Eastward upon the Sea near where the  Ottery  or River of  Otters  discharges itself into the  British  Channel and residing upon the said Farm during the Time of his last Marriage  this was the Birthplace of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and it is accordingly distinguish'd as for nothing more remarkable by topographical Writers to this Day After the Expiration of that Lease  Ralegh  apply'd but unsuccessfully to Mr  Duke  of  Otterton  to whom the Estate devolv'd to fell it him as appears by  Ralegh  's Letter to him wherein he says  That for the natural Disposition he  ad to the Place being born in that House he had rather seat himself there than any where else  From whence it seems that what some are by another  Devonian  Antiquary said to have reported and himself appears only to have recorded as if  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was born in the City of  Exeter  and in the House adjoining to the PalaceGate  has no Authority and perhaps had not so much as Rumour to countenance it  As to the Time of his Birth I find the Computation has been made from  Camden  's Account of his Age at his Death that he was born in the Year And herewith corresponds an Observation I have found in an astrological Author who fixing his Birth in the sixth Year of King  Edward  VI which answers to the Year of our Lord aforesaid calls it  A Year remarkable in our Chronicles first for that strange Shole of the largest Seafishes which quitting their native Waters for fresh and untasted Streams wandered up the  Thames  so high till the River no longer retained any Brackishness and secondly for that it is thought to have been somewhat stained in our Annals with the Blood of the noble  Seymer  Duke of  Somerset  Events says he surprisingly analogous both to the Life of this adventurous Voyager Sir  Walter Ralegh  whose Delight was in the hazardous Discovery of unfrequented Coasts and also to his unfortunate Death  That his younger Years were seasoned at the University of  Oxford  we may gather from good  Authorities as  Hooker  aforesaid Lord  Bacon  and  Anthony Wood  which last says  He became Commoner of  Oriel College  in or about the Year    when his Kinsman  C Champernon  studied there and that his natural Parts being strangely advanced by academical Learning under the Care of an excellent Tutor he became the Ornament of the Juniors and was worthily esteem'd a Proficient in Oratory and Philosophy  But in that he came so late thither as this Author mentions and stayed so long there as three Years is a Mistake for he will presently appear two Years before that Time amounts to in the Wars abroad What Time then can we spare for his Residence at  ChristChurch  College also in that University whereof Dr  Fuller  would needs have him a Member either before or after he was of  Oriel  unless we could find as I fear we shall not that he return'd from the School of  Mars  to that of the  Muses  Little more can we expect to have been observed of this remote Part of his Life and yet something more in it has been preserved by Lord  Bacon  aforesaid who had the Judgment to foresee that every little Circumstance would be acceptable of a Man whose Fortunes and Misfortunes had render'd him so memorable And indeed it has been represented to me as a Matter of no small Honour to Sir  Walter Ralegh  that a casual Expression of his in his immature and greenest Years should prefer it self to the Commemoration of that great Philosopher in his sagest and most advanced Age But as he had observed on the Nature of Things that great Objects may be discern'd through a little Crevice so he knew with Respect to the Nature of Men that a great Discovery of Genius may be made through a small and sudden Repartee and hence might he be moved to remember  That while  Ralegh  was a Scholar at  Oxford  there was a cowardly Fellow  who happened to be a very good Archer but having been grosly abused by another he bemoaned himself to  Ralegh  and ask'd his Advice  What he should do to repair the Wrong that had been offer'd him Ralegh  answer'd  Why challenge himat a Match of Shooting  How long he continued at the University is at last rightly concluded by  Anthony Wood  to be uncertain but as sure as he thinks himself right in settling him a Student of the Municipal Laws in the  Middle Temple  upon seeing a Copy of Verses he might write in that Inn of Conrt I take this Assertion to be a greater Uncertainty than the other For though Sir  Robert Naunton  and possibly from him most other Writers of  Ralegh  's Life have also consign'd him to the Study of the Law on his leaving  Oxford  there is a late Author who believes it a Mistake so obvious that no Merit can reasonably be assum'd from correcting it for Sir  Walter  at his Arraignment in a Reply to the Attorneygeneral lays a heavy Imprecation upon himself  If ever he read a Word of Law or Statutes before he was a Prisoner in the Tower  So that if this  Ralegh  was the Author of that Poem before mentioned and of the  MiddleTemple  in that Year it was written which we shall presently arrive at we must yet take Care to keep the  Lawyer  clear from the  Templar  For we are expresly told by  Hooker That after  Ralegh  had laid a good Ground to build his Actions on at the University he travell'd into  France and this is confirm'd by  Camden  according to whose Account of the Time  Ralegh  could not be at his Departure above seventeen Years of Age and by the Occasion of his first going over it will appear that a military Course of Life first fledg'd his Fame For as it has been rightly observ'd  Ralegh  had the Advantage of a stirring Age to encourage and exercise his active Genius throughout the whole Series of his first Engagements  France  was now embroil'd in Civil Wars  England  soon after to divert a menaced Danger from the encroaching Power of  Spain  lent Assistance to the then distress'd and humble States of  Holland Spain  by a political Reprisal raised stubborn Insurrections in  Ireland  and the  Pope  to make the Rebellion more permanent and more plausible religiously pretended that Kingdom was a Perquisite of St  Peter  But first of  France  and here we need not recur to the Original of those Commotions there need not trace the  Hugonots  to their Fountainhead apologise for their Oppositions against the  Guisards  labour to reconcile Queen  Elizabeth  's Defence of another Prince's oppressed Subjects to the Laws of Nations when imminent Danger by such Oppressions threatned her own nor lastly aggravate her Motives against  France  in particular from their late Violation of Covenants relating to the Rendition of  Calais  these Topics being to be sought where they have already been and it is more proper they should be directly discussed Sufficient therefore it will be to observe in this Place out of  Camden  's Annals that though the Queen had her Hand full of Disorders at home yet she was not wanting either in Commiseration or Relief to the persecuted Protestants of  France  and not only exhorted other Princes of the same Persuasion to lend their Hands to the common Cause but supply'd the Queen of  Navarre  with Money and Men to support it permitting  Henry Champernon  a Relation by Marriage of the Earl of  Montgomery  to match with a select Troop of a Hundred Gentlemen Volunteers well mounted and accoutred into  France  who bore in their Standard this Motto FINEM DET MIHI VIRTUS  Let Valour decide the Cause  In the List of these Volunteers was  Philip Butshed  with  Francis Barcley  Men afterwards of Note in their Time and this  Walter Ralegh  the most noted of all then a very young Man and first beginning to push his Fortune in the World  admodum adolescens jam primum satis monstratus  says our abovecited Annalist  The greatest Historian in  France  of those Times tells us this select Troop of Horse arrived in the  French  Camp on the th of  October  and that they were very honourably received by the Queen of  Navarre  and the Princes But what Services distinctly they performed in  France  or how long they continued there neither the Writers of that Country nor of our own have I think given full Satisfaction This Consequence we draw from some Circumstances in the latter Part of  Ralegh  's Life that he established himself a considerable Reputation while he was in that Kingdom and from  Hooker That he spent good Part of his Youth in Wars and martial Services there  Agreeable to which is that Passage in another Author who also seems to have known him where speaking of his Education he adds  It was not Part but wholly Gentleman wholly Soldier  Some  French  Historians tell us that what with the Supplies of Queen  Elizabeth  who sent the  French  Protestants a hundred thousand Angels besides some Pieces of Cannon and Ammunition and what with the Aids of their other Allies the Protestant Army which took the Field under Admiral  Coligny  and the Prince of  Conde  and encamped about  Limosin  this Year of  Ralegh  's going over being in the Beginning of their third civil War amounted to no less than fighting Men  when the King's Army under his Brother the Duke of  Anjou  being encamped at  Rochlabeille  amounted to above But others reckon the Protestant Army of equal Number and observe tho' their Men and Horse died at  Limosin  in great Numbers for Want of Food and Forage and though a great Reward was offered for the Admiral dead or alive that it only added Fuel to the Fire For what Terror could it strike says my Author into Persons who headed an Army of Men and ventured their Lives with the utmost Bravery on all Occasions As for the insincere League or Union of  France  and  England  by the pretended Marriage which appears to have been negotiated two Years after between the two Crowns it seems not to have withdrawn these  English  Auxiliaries at least not him along with them because  Ralegh  's Continuance in  France  would then fall short of  Hooker  's Implication aforesaid But as we shall discover him to have been in that Kingdom beyond the Death of King  Charles  IX which from  Ralegh  's Entrance thither is about five Years and that in this Compass of Time near Battles Sieges Overthrows Treaties and Capitulations on one Side or other may be enumerated it is manifest that our young Volunteer was hazardously engaged in some if not several of them He had afterwards Occasion to mention upon his observing here the ill Consequence of having Commanders in equal Power whom it is almost impossible to chuse of equal Courage and Discretion In another Place  Ralegh  speaks of a Stratagem which he and his Company used with Success at  Languedoc  where the Enemy had fortified themselves in certain Caves which had but one narrow Entrance cut in the Midway of the high Rocks and  which  says he  we knew not how to enter by any Ladder or Engine  'till at last by certain Bundles of lighted Straw let down by an Iron Chain with a weighty Stone in the midst those that defended it were so smothered that they surrendered themselves with their Plate Money and other Goods therein hidden or they must have died like Bees that are smoaked out of their Hives"  And in another Place he gratefully takes Notice of a Deliverance he had in these Wars 'Tis where reasoning upon the Manner and Opportunities of Retreats in Battle he first gives an Example of its being less Dishonour to retire in the Dark than to be ruined in the Light in the Sentiment of M  de la Noue  upon the Retreat made just before the Battle of  Moncountour For  says that  Frenchman staying upon our Reputation in Shew not to dislodge by Night we lost our Reputation indeed in dislodging by Day whereby we were forced to fight upon our Disadvantage and to our Ruin Yet says  Ralegh  did that worthy Gentleman Count  Lodowick  of  Nassau  Brother to the late famous Prince of  Orange  make the Retreat at  Moncountour  with so great Resolution as he saved one half of the Protestant Army then broken and disbanded of which myself was an Eyewitness and was one of them who had Cause to thank him for it  But by what Means  Ralegh  escaped that comprehensive Destruction which broke out in the third Year of this turbulent Period unless with young  Sidney  afterwards a Knight of great Renown for his own Accomplishments and the Patronage of other Men's then upon his Travels in  France  he took Sanctuary in the Ambassador  Walsingham  's House  See  Digges  's compleat Ambassador Fol  we despair at this Distance of learning For then the cruel and insidious young King aforesaid inflamed by the QueenMother and her Firebrands of Religion  perpetrated that horrible Massacre of all the Protestants in the capital City and other Parts of his Realm the Invitation to which was the Nuptials of his Sister the Signal to which was the Bell they rung to their pious Mattins and in the Execution whereof among many thousands fell the great Admiral aforesaid by the Procurement of his implacable Enemy the Duke of  Guise  The Massacre of  Paris  was begun on St  Bartholomew  's Day And if between  Mezeray  's Estimate of the Numbers that were butchered over  France  which is one of the least and  Perefixe  's which is one of the largest we incline to the medium we shall prefer the Computation of  Natalis Comes  who wrote earlier and about the very Time He reckons them at threescore thousand And so insatiable was the Fury of these Parricides that they spared neither Age Sex nor Quality But yet Sir  W Ralegh  in one of his MS Discourses on the Marriage between  England  and  Savoy  hereafter more particularly spoken of numbers them not yet so high as some of their own Historians at no less than a hundred thousand And  Margaret  Queen of  Navarre  consesses in her Memoirs  liv  That several of her Brother's Friends fell as well as his Enemies in the blind Rage of this diffusive and undistinguishing Desolation Insomuch that in Contempt of all princely Promises and Protestations of Amity their Historians were suffered to boast  More Hereticks had been destroyed in that  one Day  than in all the  twelve Years  of the War  Well therefore did that Deputy of the reformed Religion in his Treaty for a Peace with the King and Queen Mother which they agreed to insist upon Security for the Preservation of it And when the Queen Mother said  Why is not the Word of a King sufficient Security  Well did he answer  No by St  Bartholomew  Madam  How much this flagrant Exploit was gloried in over  France  and  Rome  their  Processions Thanksgivings Medals  and  Jubilee  will sufficiently declare  And though the Comet which soon after glared out of the Face of Heaven upon these bloody Actors for many Months together  This blazing Star on which different Books were written which had been read by  Tycho Brahe  the noble  Dane  before he composed his larger Work thereon first appeared on the th of  November  in the Form of a Lozenge of four Points and continued immoveable nine Months says  De Serres  Sir  Thomas Smith  in a Letter dated  December  that Year to Sir  F Walsingham  describes it a fair Comet without Beard or Tail on the Backside of  Cassiopeia  's Chair and on the Edge of  Lactea Via  that it was between the Size of  Jupiter  and  Venus  and had then appeared three Weeks in  England  But  Camden  in his Annals of Queen  Elizabeth  more particularly observes it to have shone brighter than the Planet of  Jupiter  in the Perigree of his Eccentric and Epicycle that it continued in the same Place full sixteen Months though after eight Months it visibly diminished Mr  Thomas Digges  and Dr  John Dee  two famous Mathematicians of those Times have learnedly proved by the Doctrine of Parallexes that it was fixed in the celestial not the elementary Region and that it disappeared by Ascension  Theodore Beza  very ingeniously applied it to the Star which appeared at the Slaughter of the Innocents under  Herod  And Queen  Elizabeth  's gallant Comportment at the Sight of it from her Window at  Richmond  which ought not to have escaped her Annalist aforesaid is preserved by the Earl of  Northampton  in his learned  Defensative against the Poison of supposed Prophecies  d Edit Fol p  seems to have wrought little  Remorse or Contrition in them during Life yet is their untimely and violent End with the Extirpation of the very Line of  Valois  somewhat remarkable especially that of this King himself whose early Delight in hunting of wild Beasts thus improved to the Slaughter of his Fellow Creatures 'till in less than two Years after that inhuman Massacre his insatiable Thirst of his People's Blood was quenched by an irresistible Extravasation of his own  That extraordinary Eruption of Blood carried off King  Charles  IX on the th of  May  in the th Year of his Age His Successor  Henry  III was stabbed to Death by a  Jacobin  Friar named  James Clement Anno  in that very Chamber where the Council had been held for the fatal  Bartholomew  's Day so made Way for the House of  Bourbon  And the Duke of  Guise  was murdered in the said King's Cabinet at  Blois  about a Year before See the Historians of  France  Now that  Ralegh  was 'till the Death of that King and even longer in  France  we may be fully convinced from the further Light I have fortunately  met with in an eminent Author of his own Time For Mr  Richard Hackluyt  in his most excellent Collection of Voyages dedicating his Translation of a  French  Adventure therein to Sir  Walter Ralegh  tells him That  calling to Mind you had spent more Years in  France  than I and understand the  French  better than myself I perceived you approve my Endeavour not for any private Ease but for the special Care you had of those to be employed in your own like Enterprise  And how long  Hakluyt  had been in  France  appears in his Dedication to Sir  Francis Walsingham  of his first Edition of those Voyages where he takes the Occasion to tell his Patrons that himself had been five Years in that Kingdom So that  Raleigh  must have been at least six Years there  And this will lead us near the Time we are to look for him in  London  if we take for our Guide in the Chronology of  Ralegh  's Life that Copy of Verses beforementioned which  Anthony Wood  took for his in Relation to  Ralegh  's Profession These Verses I have found to be a commendatory Poem of three Stanza's by  Walter Rawely  of the  MiddleTemple  as he is there written and printed among others before a Satire called  The Steel Glass  published in by a learned and ingenious Poet of Repute in those Days named  George Gascoigne  Esq  Now though I have had the Opportunity of seeing some original Manuscripts of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Writing and his Name written several Times by his own Hand I shall not cavil at the Pseudography thereof before the said printed Copy of Verses because I could instance greater Errors of the like Nature which yet have not excluded Authors from the Reputation of their Compositions  but more especially because there are some glimmering Circumstances which render the Writing of that Piece by this our Author probable to me as namely a Kind of familiar Dependency which that  Gascoigne  had upon the Lord  Gray  of  Wilton  as in the Dedication of this and some other of his Works is evident under which Nobleman  Ralegh  will soon after appear to have served in the Wars of  Ireland  Again  Gascoigne  had led a Life somewhat like  Ralegh  in foreign Travel and military Services Then 'tis to be noted  Gascoigne  used the very Motto under his Picture prefixed to that Satyr beforementioned which after his Death is so well known to have been assumed by or appropriated to  Ralegh  himself  Tam Martii quam Mercurio  All which seem to shadow out the Links if not the perfect Chain of some Acquaintance between them But the Poem itself to me discovers in the very first Line of it a great Air of that solid axiomatical Vein which is observable in other Productions of  Ralegh  's Muse  Sweet were the Sauce would please each Kind of Taste  And the whole middle of  Hexastic  is such an Indication of his own Fortune or Fate such a Caution against that Envy of superior Merit which he himself ever struggled with that it could proceed from no Hand more properly than his own  Though sundry Minds in sundry Sort do deem  Yet worthiest Wights yield Praise to every Pain  But envious Brains do nought or Light esteem  Such stately Steps as they cannot attain  For whoso reaps  Renown  above the Rest  With Heaps of  Hate  shall surely be oppress'd  Lastly  As to the Particular of his Being at this Time of the  MiddleTemple  all we can conclude of it is since he has so publickly and solemnly protested he never studied the Law there that it might be as customary in the Inns of Court then as it is now for a young Gentleman to be with a Friend or have the Use of his Chambers while he is out of Town or even have Chambers of his own rather than be confined to the Singularities of a Family in Lodgings and never read a Word of the Law much less have any Purpose to practise it  His next Stage of Action was in the  Netherlands  according to one of the Writers of his Life who tells us he served under the Prince of  Orange  as a Volunteer against the  Spaniards  making himself in the LowCountries Master of the Art Military and confirming through the Success of his first Campaigns his Resolution to advance himself by Arms as the nobler and readier Way to Glory Sir  Robert Naunton  also intimates that before he was in  Ireland  under the Lord  Grey  he was engaged in the  Law Countries  and also in a Voyage at Sea Another Author likewise agrees in this  Low Countries  Service and Voyage at Sea before  Ralegh  was known at Court But whereas the first of these two Writers mentions an earlier Expedition of  Ralegh  's in  Ireland  before this of the  Low Countries  as his first Exposure to a military Life being ignorant of all the Time he passed in the  French  Wars and whereas the last fixes him in that first  Irish  Expedition under General  Norris  I apprehend them to be herein both mistaken the former in that  Ralegh  appears not to have been twice against the Rebels in  Ireland  nor once at his first Engagement in War and the latter in that this  Norris  appears not to be in  Ireland  when the Course of  Ralegh  's Employments will allow him to  have been in that Kingdom But now that there is Room for  Ralegh  's being in the  Netherlands  we find General  Norris  to be there  For the Emperor  Charles  natural Son  Don John  of  Austria  a brisk forward young Man flush'd with the late victorious Battle of  Lepanto  against the  Turks  and high in the Pope's Favour being sent by his Brother the King of  Spain  in the Year Governor of the  LowCountries  to divert his Mind from higher Reaches at home and having incurr'd the general Odium of the States for his Tyranny over them no less than the Jealousy of the  English  for his Treachery to this Nation Queen  Elizabeth  thought the  Dutch  now more immediately needful of her Notice and more particularly from a Discovery that had been made to her some say by the Prince of  Orange  of a vain Project the said  Don John  had form'd of rescuing the Queen of  Scots  out of Prison and by Marriage with her or the Force of Arms to dethrone the Queen of  England  and make himself Master of her Crown sor  Don John  's  haughty Conceit of himself  says Ralegh  overcame the greatest Difficulties tho' his Judgment was overweak to manage the least  Wherefore the Queen not only receded from that Peace with the  Spaniards  and Neutrality then in Agitation but sent the States both Men and Money as they had requested to carry on the War more powerfully against them Among the Forces both  English  and  Scots  which now poured over under Sir  John Norris  Sir  Robert Stewart  Colonel  John North Henry Cavendish  and others not to forget Colonel  Thomas Morgan  whose veteran Troops were the first perfect Harquebusiers of our Nation and the first who taught us to like the Musket there is here and here only I think a Vacancy in the Story of  Ralegh  that will admit of him under the first of those  Commanders so might he probably share in the Danger and Honour of that memorable  Lammas  Day  Anno  which buried the Reputation of  Don John  which this Governor did not two Months survive and which has raised the Emulation of Pencils as well as Pens to commemorate For the States having thus gather'd a powerful Army and planted themselves near the Village of  Rimenant  about a League from  Mecklin Don John  at the Head of some say thirty thousand Men being assisted by the Prince of  Parma Mondragon  and other the best Commanders of  Spain  now resolved to give them Battle He made a furious Onset but in the End by a notable Stratagem was deluded to a great Overthrow For perceiving as he thought the whole Confederate Army encamped before the said Village in an open and inviting Plain  Don John  precipitously detach'd a stronger Force to encounter them which so succeeded on both Sides that the States Army after a convenient Resistance feigning a Flight quitted this their Counterfeit Camp the  Spaniards  eagerly pursuing in a scattered and disorderly Manner to compleat their supposed Victory till amaz'd they found themselves in the Midst of the Fugitives true Camp environ'd with nineteen thousand Horse and Foot a Number considerably greater than the Assailants To extricate themselves was impossible there was a River on one Side when they attempted the Thicket on the other it was lined with an armed Ambuscade of  English  and  Scots  and when they assaulted the Trenches they could not sustain the Fury of the Artillery Yet was the Battle vigorously maintained from Morning till Night tho' the  English  and  Scots  harrass'd by a long and wearisome March came but a Day some say but  an Hour to the Field before the Encounter began and yet partly thro' Bravery partly thro' the sultry Warmth of the Weather or as one Author has it more sensible of a little Heat of the Sun than any cold Fears of Death they made themselves further remarkable by stripping off Armour and Cloaths and fighting in their Shirts till at last those who had pursued the States Army in a pretended Flight were themselves driven with great Slaughter to a real one  Soon after his Brother Sir  Humphry Gilbert  having now newly obtain'd a Patent of the Queen to plant and inhabit some Northern Parts of  America  unpossess'd by any Prince with whom she was in Alliance soon engaged  Ralegh  upon his Return into  England  who was always ready to grasp at every Occasion that might reputably advance his Fortune or his Knowledge to embark in this Adventure For tho' the Coasts from the Cape of  Florida  Northward to the Isles now called the  Newfoundlands  had been before discovered by  John Cabot  the Father with  Sebastian  and  Sancius  his Sons both  Englishmen  born through the Authority and Expence of King  Henry  VII yet there wanted not only more inland Researches and the Establishment of Christianity but the very Trade and Commerce with  Newfoundland  was very slothfully neglected even since the Reign of King  Edward  VI  And yet within four Years before Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  obtain'd his Patent there resorted to the Coasts of  Newfoundland  for Fish about fifty Sail of  English  above a hundred Sail of  Spaniards  for Cod and thirty more from  Biscay  for Whale to make Trainoil above fifty Sail of  Portuguese  and about an hundred and fifty Sail of the  French  and  Bretaigns  My Author observes that the Trade our Nation had then to  Iceland  was the Reason the  English  were not there in such Numbers as other Nations  for our Merchants and Adventurers in his Time enrich'd this Nation considerably from  their Fishery in those Parts as appears by that Act wherein Care is taken to prevent the Exaction of any Doles or Taxes from them by the Officers of the Admiralty that they might not be discourag'd from the Merchandize of Fish but transport it more plentifully into the Realm and at more reasonable Rates Now  Gilbert  having as I said procured an ample Commission to repossess these Advantages with Improvement many Gentlemen of good Account resorted to him among whom was his Brother  Ralegh  so that from these Preparations was expected a potent Fleet Nevertheless among such Variety of Volunteers Dispositions were various which in the End bred Division and even Confusion of the Attempt for after the Shipping was by Degrees prepared and the Men ready to go aboard some disagreeing in Opinion some shrinking at Obedience and others failing of their Promises and Engagements the greater Number were dispersed leaving the General with a few only of his assured Friends  However with these he ventur'd to Sea where having tasted of no less Misfortune he was shortly after driven to retire home with the Loss of a tall Ship and more to his Grief of a valiant Gentleman named  Miles Morgan Now this Misfortune at Sea and Loss of a Ship with that valiant Gentleman I have not only Reason to believe was by a sharp Encounter they had with the  Spaniards  however tenderly touch'd at that Time perhaps to avoid their Triumph but that  Ralegh  was in this very Engagement and his Life in great Danger thereby For there is another Author who in his Address to him before mention'd tells him that after his Return from his Landservices having gained sufficient Knowledge and Experience therein  to the End that you might be every Way able to serve your Prince and Commonwealth  says he  you were desirous to be acquainted with  maritimal  Affairs then you together with your Brother Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  travelled the Seas for the Search of such Countries as if they had then been discover'd infinite Commodities in sundry Respects would have ensued and whereof there was no Doubt if the Fleet then accompanying you had according to Appointment followed you or your self had escaped the dangerous  Seafight  when many of your Company was slain and your Ships therewith also sore batter'd and disabled  This ill Success kept not these Adventures long abroad and now new Disturbances broke out which called for Men of Experience in War at home For the first Dart of any Consequence which was thrown from  Spain  or  Rome  upon  Ireland  being in we shall then find  Ralegh  among that Body of his Countrymen which effectually broke its Force and shielded off the Mischief wherewith it would otherwise have gall'd that Kingdom For as to the Invasion of  Thomas Stucley  two Years before it blew over into  Africa  where that Meteor of Ostentation and Tool of ambitious Princes fell in the Plains of  Alcazar  and with Royal Company expir'd But now that  James FitzMorris  of the  Geraldine  Family was come over and not long after  San Josepho  under the Pope's Banner with  Spanish  and  Italian  Forces to assist the  Desmonds  in the  Munster  Rebellion and had landed in three Ships at  Smerwick  in  Kerry  where having built a Fort which they call'd  Fort del Ore  and refortify'd it with the Benedictions of  Allen  an  Irish  and  Sanders  an  English  Jesuit the  Irish  Rebels under Sir  James  and Sir  John  Brothers to the late Earl of  Desmond  soon resorted thither to join as the  English  Forces also did to disperse them Their Ships were soon taken by  Thomas Courtenay  a  Devonshire  Gentleman and  FitzMorris  himself for a Prey he had made of some  Garons  and other Cattle was by Sir  William Burk  and his Sons soon  lain and his Quarters expos'd at  Kilmallock  The next whose Fate drew on was Sir  James Desmond  who on the Fourth of  August  in the above mentioned Year having made an Inroad upon  Muskerry  and taken a great Booty from Sir  Cormac Mac Teige  Sheriff of  Cork  the said Sheriff making Head against him recover'd the Booty wounded Sir  James  mortally and took him Prisoner In that Condition he was kept till by Letters from the Lord Justice named Sir  William Pelham  and the Council he was deliver'd to Sir  Warham Sentleger  then Provost marshal of  Munster  and to Captain  Ralegh  and according to the Commission directed to them he was examin'd indicted arraign'd and then upon Judgment drawn hang'd and quarter'd and his Head and Limbs impal'd upon the Citygates of  Cork  sor a Terror to his Associates and a Prey for the Fowls of the Air And this is the first Appearance we meet with of  Ralegh  in  Ireland  enough to shake the Report of those who say he was a  Militia  there and had his first Commission from  Arthur  Lord  Grey  Baron of  Wilton  But the chief Commander in these parts at this Time was the Earl of  Ormond  soon after Governor of  Munster  a Man of such Loyalty as to have reduc'd his rebellious Brothers to Allegiance and of such Courage as constantly partaking in every Danger with his own Soldiers made him much beloved by all his Adherents while his apparent Contempt thereby of that Danger gain'd him no less Fear from all his Adversaries He on the other Side bending his Course against the foreign Enemy encamped his Army at  Tralegh  within  Kén of the  Spanish  Fort aforesaid Hereupon many of those Invaders dislodged whom the Earl valiantly engag'd slaying some and taking others Prisoners the rest flew to the Coverts of  Glaningell  The Prisoners he took confess'd their Force was not above seven hundred strong but that they had brought Arms and Ammunition for five thousand Natives besides a Mass of Money for the  Desmonds  and Dr  Sanders  and daily expected farther Supplies from  Rome  for it was absolutely determined by the Pope and King  Philip  to make a compleat Conquest of  Ireland  and  England  besides nay so confident they seemed of Success if we can credit the Assertion of an Author who was this Year in  Spain  that his Holiness had provided a Chalice to drink the Queen of  England  's precious Blood says he as soon as she should be made a Sacrifice Now after the aforesaid Defeat about of the Enemy having made their Way back to the Fort the Earl followed them close and encamped at  Dingle  but wanting Ammunition for a Battery was forced to retire And finding himself of unequal Force to withstand another Salley the  Spaniards  made returned to join the Deputy at  Rakele  who having now about eight hundred Horse and Foot with him under the Conduct of Captain  Ralegh Zouch Denny Mackworth  and others decamped and marched up towards the Fort But  Ralegh  who had observed it to be the Custom of the  Irish Kerns  upon any Dislodgement of the  English  Camp to flock in Parties thither and glean away whatever they saw left behind linger'd and lay in Ambush to receive them They came accordingly with their wonted Constancy and Greediness but in the Midst of their Proling  Ralegh  fell upon them so advantageously that he enclos'd them all with his Men and took  every Rebel upon the Spot who was not slain in Resistance Among them there was one laden with Withies who being demanded  What he intended to have done with them  Boldly answer'd  To have hung up the  English  Churls Well  said Ralegh  but they shall now serve for an  Irish  Kern  so commanded him to be immediately tuck'd up in one of his own Neckbands and dealt with the rest of these Robbers and Murderers according to their Deserts We read of another  Irish  Rebel but of greater Rank named  Brian O Rourk  who being afterwards to suffer at the Gallows shew'd great Concern that it was to be by the common Halter and earnestly petition'd not for Pardon or  Preservation  of his  Life  but that they would change the  Instrument  of his  Death  and instead of a  Rope  to let him take his Swing in a  Withy  but being ask'd  Why he insisted upon such an insignificant Distinction  he answer'd  'Twas a Distinction had been paid to his Countrymen before him  While the Lord Deputy lay before the Fort there arriv'd in the Bay of  Smerwick  Viceadmiral  Bingham  and soon after Sir  William Winter  Admiral of the Fleet with fresh Supplies Hereupon the Lord Deputy resolved to besiege the Fort by Land while the Admiral should batter it by Sea But first the  Spaniards  were summon'd to surrender at Discretion they answered  They were sent some from the  Holy Father  who had given that Realm to King  Philip  and some from that King who was to recover this Land to the Church of  Rome  which by her Majesty's Means was become schismatical and excommunicate therefore in short were obliged to retain what they had and recover what they could  Nor did they omit the Advantage they thought this Parley would produce of finding the  English  unguarded to make a Sally upon them but they  were so disappointed through the Vigilance and Valour of  Ralegh  's Company and that of Captain  Denny  that such as were not left dead behind were forced to retreat with more Haste than good Speed The Culverins and other Pieces of Ordnance being now landed and a large mountainous Bank laboriously cut through for the Carriages to pass to the Place convenient for planting them the Deputy is said to have given the Enemy another Summons by Cannonshot to surrender and receive Mercy But they answer'd as before thereupon the Artillery was order'd to attack the Fort both by Land and Water  Ralegh  commanded the first three Days after the Opening of the Trenches and assaulted the Fort so roughly from his Battery that he forced the  Spaniards  to several Excursions but they skirmish'd so warily and hived again so nimbly that there was no closing with them effectually The fourth Day was commanded by  Zouch  under whom  John Cheke  the Son of a Knight well known among the learned for his Writings venturing so near the Fort as to look over the Parapet being observed by a  Spaniard  who levell'd his Piece and brought him to the Ground But now the Trenches for the full Battery were drawn so near the  Spaniards  and the  English  play'd their Cannon so furiously and incessantly upon them from every Side and finding no Succours arrive they beat a Parley and hung out the white Flag crying out  Misericordia Misericordia  but the Lord Deputy would not listen to any Treaty with the Confederates of Traitors and Rebels no not so much as to their Departure with Bag and Baggage or free Passage to any one particular Person nothing but an absolute Surrender And as for Mercy which  Hooker  before intimates to have been offer'd on proviso of their timely Submission we find by  Edmund Spenser  who was then Secretary to the Lord Deputy and upon the very Spot that his Lordship never gave the  Spaniards  any Hopes of it  For after the Lord Deputy had discovered that they had yielded and surrendered the Fort on the Ninth of  November Ralegh  and  Mackworth  who had the Ward of that Day first entered the Castle and with their Companies made a great Slaughter so that except one  Irish  Nobleman who was reprieved another  Irishman  and an  Englishman  who were sent to publick Execution except also  San Josepho  the  Spanish  Commander and his Camp master with a few  Spanish  Officers who were sent Prisoners into  England  and reserved for Ransom all the Invaders between four and five hundred were according to the Deputy's positive Command put to the Sword and the Country was thus weeded of these noxious Foreigners As for  Ralegh  he never was taxed that I can learn with any Cruelty upon this Account more than  Mackworth  or the rest of the Officers  Ralegh  was quartered this Winter at  Cork  where he observed the seditious Practices of  David  Lord  Barry Patrick Condon  and other Ringleaders of the Rebellion in those Parts to distress so intolerably those Subjects who were peacefully inclined and foment the disaffected to an Insurrection that he was forced to take a Journey in Person to the Lord Deputy at  Dublin  where he remonstrated the dangerous Consequences he foresaw so urgently that the Case being taken into Consideration by his Lordship and the Council they return'd him with a full Commission to enter upon the Castle called  BarryCourt  with all other Lands of the said  Barry  and to reduce him to Peace and Subjection by such Means as he judg'd most feasible appointing him for his farther Enablement a Party  of Horse In the Interim such Measures were used with those in Authority at  Cork  that the Commission proved of little Effect but though the said Estate of  BarryMore  was made over to the Mother of  David Barry  and only rented to the Son and though it was his principal Seat yet partly in Fear of that Commission partly through Spite and Indignation he burnt the Castle himself to the Ground and wasted the Country about it with greater Outrage and Destruction than his Enemies had they taken it would have done Moreover as  Ralegh  was on his Journey back to his Quarters an old Rebel of  Barry  's Faction named  FitzEdmonds  and his Crew sallied from their Ambuscade and cross'd him to oppose his Passage whom  Ralegh  manfully encountered and defeated or at least broke thro' them so that he got clear over the River but one of his Company Mr  Henry Mole  following his Horse foundering threw him down in the Middle of it where between Fear of drowning and being taken by the Enemies he called out to  Ralegh  for Help who tho' he had escaped both Dangers yet incurred them again to save his Companion's Life but  Moyle  in Haste and Confusion remounting overleap'd his Horse and fell down on the other Side into a deep Mire where he might have been stifled had not  Ralegh  recovered him a second Time and brought him safe to Land but his Horse run over to the Rebels  Ralegh  waited on the opposite Bank with his Staff  These Staves were not short like Truncheons but rather like Poles or Watermen's Stretchers though not so long or clumsily made for being headed at one End with a sharp Point or Pile of Iron they might be used for Defence or Offence either as Quarter staves or Spears  in one Hand and a Pistol in the other for the rest of his Company who were  yet to cross the River among whom was his Servant  Jenkin  who had two hundred Pounds of his Money in Charge a Sum in those Days enough to make a Soldier of Fortune in these Circumstances look about him especially now  Fitz Edmonds  had got a Recruit of twelve Men and was in all above twenty strong against him Yet this Hero as his Party called him when he beheld  Ralegh  stand his Ground and the rest of his Company advance whom he possibly thought might be of greater Number than they were only exchanged a few rough Words with him and thought it best to offer no further Molestation  Soon after the Earl of  Ormond  departed from his long and wearisome Services here to  England  about the Spring of the Year His Government of  Munster  was given to Captain  Ralegh  in Commission with Sir  William Morgan  and Captain  Piers Ralegh  lay for the most Part at  Lismore  and in the Country and Woods thereabouts spent all this Summer in continual Action against the Rebels  Then  Ralegh  removed with his little Band of fourscore Foot and eight Horse to his old Quarters at  Cork  but receiving Intelligence by the Way that the Archtraitor  Barry  was at  Clove  with several hundred Men he resolved to pass through that Town and offer him the Combat Accordingly at the Town's End he met  Barry  and his Forces whom  Ralegh  charged with great Bravery and put him to Flight As he pursued his Journey he overtook another Company of the Enemy in a Plain by a Woodside upon whom having only six Horsemen with him expecting probably his Company would soon join him he gave the Onset but the Rebels who were in much greater Number being cut off from the Wood and  having no other Relief faced about and fought very desperately killing five of the Horses belonging to  Ralegh  's Company whereof his own was one and he himself very near being overborne by the Numbers upon him had not his trusty Servant  Nicholas Wright  a  Yorkshire  Man interpos'd who perceiving his Master's Horse so mortally wounded with Darts and plunging past all Recovery encounter'd six of the Enemy at once and killed one of them while another of his Fellowservants named  Patrick Fagaw  rescued  Ralegh  which had been so unsuccessfully attempted by  James FitzRichard  and his Kern both of  Ralegh  's Company that the Man was slain and the Master very near the same Fate whereupon  Ralegh  would not suffer  Wright  to fight by him any longer but ordered him  to charge above hand and save the Gentleman  At which Command he rush'd into the Throng of the Enemy dispatch'd the Antagonist who press'd forest upon Mr  FitzRichard  and rescued him In this sharp Skirmish there were many of the Rebels slain and two taken Prisoners whom  Ralegh  carried with him to  Cork  and while he lay here he performed several other notable Services which deserve to be for ever register'd  Among the rest his excellent Conduct in the Seizure of the Lord  Roch  is more particularly remember'd and applauded This Nobleman being much suspected to hold Confederacy with some of the chief Rebels  Ralegh  undertook to bring with his Family before the Earl of  Ormond  at  Cork  But the Design of this hazardous Surprise took Air among the Enemy and a Party of Men under  FitzEdmonds  and  Barry  were gather'd to waylay the  English  either going or coming However  Ralegh  knowing the Lord  Roch  to be a  powerful and popular Man among the  Irish  so suddenly commanded all his Company to be in Readiness by Eleven aClock that Night and they were so punctual to the Hour that he directly marched away to  Bally  in  Harsh  which was  Roch  's Seat about twenty Miles from  Cork  and escaped the Ambuscade He arrived there by Break of Day but the Townsmen were so alarmed that they soon gathered strong  Ralegh  drew up and in such Manner bestowed his Men in the Town it self that he soon quell'd and restrain'd the People there then selecting half a Dozen out of his Company and having appointed another little Party to follow him he marched up to the Castle He was met by three or four of  Roch  's Gentlemen of whom he desir'd to speak with their Lord which was agreed to on Condition he would dismiss three or four of his own Attendants to which with apparent Readiness he comply'd but so contrived that none of them were locked out Then he gave them Directions which Way the rest also without the Gates might be admitted whilst he should hold the Lord  Roch  in Discourse which succeeded so happily that by Degrees his whole Compliment were got within the Courtyard some guarding the Gates others watching in the Hall each having his Piece loaden with a Brace of Balls The Lord  Roch  was amaz'd and terrify'd at so silent and insensible a Seizure but dissembling his Uneasiness he would needs have  Ralegh  and the Gentlemen with him participate of his plentiful Table yet the Policy of his Hospitality did not defeat that of their Enterprise for as soon as the Dinner was over  Ralegh  ingenuously laid open the Occasion of his Visit Lord  Roch  made many Excuses and in the End absolutely refused to go along with him But when the Commission was  produced and he found  Ralegh  inflexible he chose to do that by Consent which he found he must do by Compulsion Then  Ralegh  urged him to oblige his Townsmen likewise who had so faithfully risen for his Defence in his Neighbourhood to escort and defend him in his Journey to which Lord  Roch  also consented professing he doubted not but to clear himself of whatever Allegations should be laid to his Charge When his Lordship with his Lady and Attendants had made themselves ready  Ralegh  was for another nocturnal Progress but though the Night fell out so very dark and tempestuous and the Ways were so full of Hills and Dales Rocks and Precipices that many of his Soldiers were much bruised by Falls and one of them so mortify'd that he lost his Life in the March yet the Veil wherewith the rest were shelter'd by that Obscurity from the more dangerous Ambuscades of their Enemy who had every where bestrew'd the Passages to intercept them made such sufficient Compensation for those Disasters that by the next Morning early he safely presented his Prisoners to the General not without raising an universal Astonishment at his dexterous Evasion of so many Perils But the Lord  Roch  upon Examination being honourably acquitted he approved himself a faithful Subject ever after and three of his Sons laid down their Lives in her Majesty's Service  In the Month of  August  the same Year the Lord Deputy made the aforesaid Captain  John Zouch  Governor of  Munster  with whom  Ralegh  and  Dowdal  made several Journeys to settle and compose the Country but the certain Place of their Residence was at  Cork  And when  Zouch  with  Dowdal  made that secret Expedition in which he lopp'd off the third Branch of this venomous  Hydra Sir  John Desmond  whose Body was hung by the Heels on a Gibbet then fixed on the Gates of that City and his Head sent to  London  he left the Government of  Cork  to  Ralegh  who appears no longer after this Reduction in the Wars of  Ireland  But how well his Services were received by the Queen and how nobly she rewarded him for them after the Earl of  Desmond  himself was slain we shall hear when we arrive at the Time that his large Possessions came to be divided among those who had assisted in quenching the Flames of his Rebellion  Ralegh  was not long in  England  before his Relation in some Degree to the Court began to appear Tradition has industriously abscrib'd his first Introduction thither to a Piece of Gallantry wherewith he surpris'd the Queen accidentally in one of her Walks  Her Majesty meeting says my Author with a plashy Place made some Scruple to go on when Ralegh dress'd in the gay and genteel Habit of those Times presently cast off and spread his new Plushcloak on the Ground whereon the Queen trod gently over rewarding him afterwards with many Suits for his so free and seasonable Tender of so fair a  Footcloth  Thus an advantageous Admission into the Notice of a Prince is more than half a Degree to Preferment  After this Ralegh coming to Court and finding some Hopes of the Queen's Favour reflecting upon him he wrote in a Glass Window obvious to her Eye  Fain would I climb yet fear I to fall  Under which her Majesty soon after wrote  If thy Heart fail thee climb not at all  But though he always made a very elegant Appearance as well in the Splendor of Attire as the Politeness of Address  having a good Presence in a handsome and well compacted Person a strong natural Wit and a better Judgment with a bold and plausible Tongue whereby he could set out his Parts to the best Advantage  All very engaging Advocates for Royal Favour especially in a female Sovereign But be that as it may we find him upon his Return into  England  employed in an Expedition or two by Authority belike from the Court they being upon Occasions of State And though it imports not much whether it was now or before he was in  Ireland  that he accompanied the  French  Ambassador Monsieur  Simier  among those Gentlemen who were appointed for his safe Convoy to  France  yet if that Ambassador returned home when his Master the Duke of  Anjou  came last over in  November  the Year beforenamed this is the Place for it to be mentioned in  But after the Duke of  Anjou  himself had been three Months in  England  he also departed to take upon him the Government of the  Netherlands  This Departure was in  February  following and though the Queen seems to have declined the Marriage with him principally because she found her Ministry so averse to it yet there was an Author and his Printer who for having published a little Treatise against it about two Years before  This Treatise is entitled  The Discovery of a gaping Gulph wherein  England  is likely to be swallowed by another  French  Marriage  c Printed with a small Letter in a thin Octav    had their Hands cut off but a few Days after the Duke came to  London  The Names of this Author and his Printer or Publisher were  John Stubbs  and  William Page  and that Sentence was executed on them at  Westminster November  Vide  Stow  's Chronicles and  Camden  's Annals in those Years  And she shewed him many  other Marks of Favour and Distinction particularly when he left the Kingdom she bore him Company in Person to  Dover  and having appointed a most splendid Retinue of Nobles and Gentlemen to wait upon him to his new Government I find that  Ralegh  was also among this grand Assembly They attended the Duke to  Antwerp  where making a most magnificent Procession he was created Duke of  Brabant  c and invested with his Charge  Ralegh  seems not only to have staid there some Time after the Lord Admiral  Howard Leicester  young  Sidney  and the rest were return'd but through the Opportunity of being personally known to the Prince of  Orange  honoured with some special Acknowledgments from him to the Queen of  England  And  Ralegh  mentions thus much himself in a Discourse he wrote many Years afterwards wherein fpeaking of the  Hollanders  flourishing State he lays down as the first Cause thereof the Favour and Assistance granted them by this Crown  which says he the late worthy and famous Prince of  Orange  did always acknowledge and in the Year    when I took my Leave of him at  Antwerp  after the Return of the Earl of  Leicester  into  England  and  Monsieur  's Arrival there when he delivered me his Letters to her Majesty he prayed me to say to the Queen from him  Sub umbra alarum tuarum protegimur  For certainly says he they had  wither'd  in the  Bud  and  sunk  in the Beginning of their  Navigation  had not her Majesty assisted them  Towards the End of  August  this last mentioned Year the Lord  Grey  resign'd the Sword of  Ireland  after he had been two Years Deputy in that Kingdom and this must be the Time that Dispute  between him and  Ralegh  was brought to a Hearing of which Authors have so blindly written Sir  Robert Naunton is confident that among the second Causes of  Ralegh  's Growth not denying or rather acquiescing in his Actions and Accomplishments to have been the first that Variance between him and the Lord  Grey  in his Descent into  Ireland  was a Principal for it drew them both over says he to the Counciltable there to plead their Cause where what Advantage he had in the Cause my said Author knew not but says he had much the better in telling of his Tale and so much that the Queen and the Lords took no slight Mark of the Man and his Parts for from thence he came to be known and to have Access to the Queen and the Lords  Now if this Author is so defective as not to have known the Cause or Subject of their Quarrel or that  Ralegh  leaving  Ireland  long before the Lord  Grey  was not likely to be drawn over together with him to the Council table how much more must those Writers following him be so who have confused this Matter with several other Particulars though they seem to have had no other Authority One of them says  Ralegh  had in  Deed  but not in  Truth  the better by the Tongue and insinuates with great Caution and Delicacy he thought no Doubt that the Queen had been told something so engaging of  Ralegh  besides his Advantage in Pleading that it was  not to be mentioned  as if any of her Courtiers dared to say any Thing to the Queen's Face which this anonymous Writer near fifty Years after her Death would be either asham'd or afraid to repeat A later Writer makes such Distinctions of  Ralegh  's extraordinary Behaviour in this Dispute as if he had been at the Counciltable and seen as well as heard him And another after them all has found out the Cause of  this Difference between them to be Captain  Zouch  's Preferment  The Author of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Life in  Lives English and Foreign  Vol p says that  Ralegh  's Disgust at the Deputy's preferring  Zouch  grew to a Difference between him and the said Lord  Grey  which was referr'd by the Council of War in  Ireland  to that in  England  and there decided in  Ralegh  's Favour the solliciting of which Business was the true Cause of his leaving  Ireland  But he quotes no Authority and I think by what is before said of the Matter this true Cause will appear a groundless Conjecture at least less probable than what might perhaps be drawn from  Spenser's View of Ireland  Vol p    But passing these over our Author  Naunton  goes on and tho' he does not determine whether the Lord  Leicester  had then cast in a good Word for  Ralegh  to the Queen yet says  it is true that he had gotten the Queen's Ear at a Trice and she began to be taken with his Elocution and loved to hear his reasons to her Demands and the Truth is she took him for a Kind of Oracle which  nettled them all  yea those he relied on began to take this his sudden Favour for an Alarm to be sensible of their own Supplantation and to project his which made him shortly after sing  Fortune my Foe c  It is hinted to us somewhat more expresly by another Courtwriter of those Times that the Earl of  Leicester  befriended  Ralegh  perhaps through his Friendship with young  Sidney  that Earl's worthily beloved Nephew in his first Advancement at Court and that being willing for his own Ease to bestow handsomely upon another some Part of the Pains and perhaps of the Envy to which a long indulgent Fortune is obnoxious either brought or let him into that promising Sphere of Preferment where the Earl soon found him such an Apprentice as knew well enough how to set up for himself So that if the Earl of  Sussex  who was  Leicester  's Antagonist had any Hand in  Ralegh  's Rise as some later Writers of less Authority have suggested it seems to have been afterwards when  Ralegh  's courtly Splendor was somewhat obstructed and  Leicester  meant to allay it by interposing the young Earl of  Essex  for  Ralegh  continued during that Storm in some Lustre of a favoured Man like Billows which sink but by Degrees even when the Wind is down that first stirr'd them But this we shall observe as we go on that in all the different Aspects or Conjunctions of Interest thro' the Access or Change of new Favourites in this long Reign none were less immerg'd by the Smiles of the Court in the Luxuries and Vanities of it nor more animated by its Frowns to the enterprising of publick and superior Difficulties for the Honour and Aggrandisement of his Country Not that he set out to Sea but when he had despaired of raising himself on Shore for these publick Enterprizes were rooted so early in  Ralegh  's aspiring Mind that we perceive even now before Factions at Court could drive him from the Land or Preferments and Grants from the Crown enable him for the Sea that he had built at his own Expence to prosecute them a strong handsome Ship which was named  Bark Ralegh  of two hundred Ton Burden  And now that the six Years Period of Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  's Patent grew short four of them being elaps'd he thought it high Time to make a new Attempt in Person since his Assignments had proved of little Consequence at those Discoveries he had before fail'd in that he might confirm by Experience what he had so excellently advanced in Theory Accordingly having fitted out a Fleet of four Ships  Ralegh  also victuall'd and mann'd out his beforementioned which was the largest  among them and in the Quality of Viceadmiral set out to bear his Brother  Gilbert  Company in this his last Expedition to  Newfoundland  The Fleet departed from  Plymouth  on the th of  June  My Author who was in this Voyage tells us no Cost was spared by  Ralegh  in Provisions and Necessaries for the happy Accomplishment of it yet that in two or three Days following he returned greatly distress'd to  Plymouth  by Reason his whole Ship's Company was infected with a contagious Sickness But lucky to him perhaps was this Visitation since the Voyage proved so fatal to those who went through it particularly Sir  Humphrey  himself who tho' he arrived in  Newfoundland  in the Beginning of  August  following took Possession of the Country in Right of the Crown of  England  by digging up a Turf and receiving it with a Hasel Wand delivered to him according to our Law and Custom also had assign'd Lands to every Man in his Company and was got three hundred Leagues in his Way home again with full Hopes of the Queen's Assistance to fit out a Fleet not only for the North but one also for the South next Year yet overhardily venturing in a little Frigat of but ten Ton Burden called the  Squirrel  he was on the Ninth of  September  following at Midnight in a high Sea swallowed up  As Authors have been very defective and erroneous in their Accounts of this brave and publickspirited but unfortunate Knight Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  of  Compton  I shall here observe that  John Hooker  who knew him says he was bred at  Oxford Hooker  takes Notice of his extraordinary Services in  Ireland  for which he was made Colonel of  Munster  and Sir  Roger Williams  in his  Actions of the Low countries  tells us he was the first  English  Commander who led a Regiment thither to serve the Prince of  Orange  against the  Spaniards  But  John Prince  who pretends to give us his Life among his Worthies of  Devon  mentions nothing of his Landservices The said  J Prince  quotes Sir  W Pole  's MSS to vouch this  Gilbert  's being knighted by the Queen at  Greenwich  But  Hooker  aforesaid shews him to have been knighted in the Church at  Drogheda  by Sir  Hon Sidney  Deputy of  Ireland  seven Years sooner at least and agreeable thereto we find him call'd Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  in a Letter of Sir  Thomas Smith  's dated among Sir  D Digges  's Collection before mentioned p Lastly another Writer of his Life in  Latin  places his last Expedition to  Newfoundland  Years sooner than he undertook it if it is not the Fault rather of the Printer than the Author  Vid Hollandi Herwologia Anglica  fol  Arnheim  p As for Sir  Humphrey  's Writings we have extant in  Hakluyt  Vol p his  Discourse  to prove a Passage by the Northwest to  Cathay  and the  EastIndies  in ten Chapters first publish'd in to at the End of which he mentions another Discourse now lost I fear wherein he amended the usual Errors of  Seacards  which make the Degrees of Longitude in every Latitude of equal Bigness and invented a  spherical Instrument  with a  Compass of Variation  for the perfect Knowledge of the Longitude and laid down a precise Order to prick the  Seacards  with certain Rules for the shortning any Discovery and knowing at the first Entrance of any  Fret  whether it lies open to the Ocean more Ways than one and how far the  Sea  stretches itself into the  Land  As for the Picture at  Compton  said by  Prince  to be drawn for Sir  H Gilbert  if his Author Sir  W Pole  is no truer in his Assertion of the Queen's having given Sir  Humphrey  the Gold Chain represented about the Neck thereof than he was in her having knighted him and there are no other Signatures besides that Chain and the Inscription of  Virginia  on the Globe with the Verses under it relating thereto I see not but the Picture is to be doubted as rather meant for his Brother  Ralegh  who was honoured with a Golden Chain by the Queen and whose Title to that Inscription on the Globe was beyond any Man's in the World But the stately Poem in  Latin Hexameters  upon his last Expedition by  Stephanus Parmenius Budeius  a learned  Hungarian  who was drowned with him was undoubtedly among other  English  Adventurers therein nam'd chiefly intended for his Honour  Another  of the Vessels called the  Delight  but few Days before also suffered the same Fate and even the rest returned not without great Hazard Hardship and Loss teaching says  Camden  that it is a more difficult Manner to carry over Colonies to remote  Countries upon private Men's Purses than he and others had persuaded themselves to their own Loss and Detriment but neither these unfortunate Attempts by Sea hitherto nor the Ruin of Sir  Humphrey Gilbert  's Estate nor the Loss of his Life nor the Hardships of all his Company besides could teach  Ralegh  that Lesson These Examples and this Experience were so far from satiating that they did but sharpen his Appetite to such honourable Dangers  And as we are assured from Family Tradition by a late Author of his own Name and Lineage that the Discoveries of the great  Columbus  the Conquests of  Fernando Cortez  the famous  Francis Pizarro  and other Leaders of the  Spaniards  who under the Emperor  Charles  and his Son  Philip  II had made the greatest and most surprising Additions to their Empire that ever Prince received or Subjects wrought were the favourite Histories that took up  Ralegh  's early Reading and Conversation while he was but a young Man we may presume they so possessed his noble Genius with perhaps also some late domestic and living Examples that no little personal Oppositions at Home or particular Misadventures Abroad could ever discourage him from the Pursuit of these grand and national Undertakings But when by his own Observation he found the  Spaniards  had only settled upon the middle and southern Parts of  America  and that there were certain vast Territories yet unknown to the North of those Lands which the  Spaniards  already enjoyed as fit perhaps for Settlement and as easy to conquer as any they did enjoy And when by his Enquiries among the most observant Pilots and Mariners who had sailed in the  Spanish  Ship to the Gulph of  Mexico  many of whom he had Opportunity to meet and discourse with in  Holland  and  Flanders  he had learnt that the  Spaniards  always went into the Gulph of  Mexico  by  St Domingo  and the Island of  Hispaniola  where the Currents with the Tradewinds always ran together and set into the Bay that they always disembogu'd as they called it or came out by the  Havana  and the Channels of  Bahama  which they now call the Gulph of  Florida  and that as they returned by this Gulph they found a continued Coast on the West Side trending away North which they generally lost Sight of by standing away to the East to make for the Coast of  Spain Ralegh  fully determined that there was a vast Extent of Land North of that Gulph or West from the Coast of  Spain  which might be well worth discovering and after mature Deliberation fully resolved upon the Discovery As soon as he had digested his Proposal and displayed the Manner of prosecuting it in proper Schemes he laid them before the Queen and Council to whom it appearing a rational practical and generous Undertaking her Majesty was pleased in the Beginning of the Year to grant him full Power to enjoy such Countries as he proposed to discover by her Letters Patents  Immediately upon the Grant of this Patent  Ralegh  gave his Instructions for an  American  Voyage  But that he now sailed thither himself or then made the Discovery whatever he might do before of the Country hereafter mentioned in Person and returned in the Beginning of as the Author of his Life in  Lives English and Foreign  tells us vol I p is all Fancy and Fiction  to Captain  Philip Amadas  and Captain  Arthur Barlow  two experienced Commanders and had got a Couple of Barks well furnished with Men and Provivisions at his own Expence in such Readiness that on the th Day of  April  following they departed  from the West of  England  The th of  May  they arrived at the  Canaries  and a Month after fell upon the Isles of the  WestIndies which with the Rest adjoining says my Author one of those Captains are so well known to yourself directing the Account of this Voyage to his Proprietor and to many others that I will not trouble you with the Remembrance of them  In the Beginning of  July  they were saluted with a most fragrant Gale from the Land they were seeking and soon after arrived upon the Coast but sailed along some sixscore Miles before they could find an Entrance by any River issuing into the Sea At last discovering one they manned out their Boats to view the Land adjoining where they saw Vines laden with Grapes in vast Abundance climbing up the tall Cedars and spreading so luxuriantly along the sandy Shore that the Sea often overflowed them On the th of  July  they took Possession in Right of the Queen and afterwards delivered the Country over to  Ralegh  's Use They thought this Land had at first been the Continent but found it afterwards only an Island Miles long called  Wocoken  plentifully stocked with Animals Groves of sweetsmelling Trees Pulse Grain and esculent Roots They observed along the Coast a Tract of Islands or Miles long and passing between them saw another great Sea and in some Places Miles over before they could reach the Continent and in this inclosed Sea above Islands of various Size whereof one is Miles long called  Roanoak  and about seven Leagues distant up the River  Occam  from the Harbour they first entered at which they chiefly settled while they staid finding it so pleasant and fruitful as to yield three Harvests in five Months But they remained upon the Borders of  Wocoken  two Days before they beheld a human Creature on  the third they saw a Boat rowing towards them with three of the Natives one of them landed and walked up the Shore near their Ship for they were then on Board then the two Captains with some others took their Boat and rowed to Land and by their courteous Carriage soon prevailed on the Native to return with them on Board where they cloathed him and gave him Victuals Wine and several little Toys or Utensils which won the simple Creature's Heart Soon after his Departure he returned again with a Boat full of Fish to be divided between the Ship and the Pinnace and then he left them The next Day came the King's Brother  Granganimeo  with a great many Attendants for the King himself who was named  Wingina  and his large Territories  Wingandacoa  lay ill of the Wounds he had lately received in War His Brother was highly pleased with his Entertainment and having received several Presents soon after sent the Savages to traffick with the  English  also came again himself and exchanged Skins worth as many Nobles for a Tin Dish which he hung as a Gorget about his Neck to defend him from the Arrows of his Enemies Then also he brought his Wife and Children with her Attendants or in Number She was wellfavour'd but bashful clad in a Mantle of Deerskin lined with Fur and a Kind of Apron of the same her Hair hung down long on each Side with a Band of white Coral about her Forehead and long Bracelets of Pearl down to her Middle as big as Pease in her Ears  a Bracelet whereof we delivered to your worship  says my Author to  Ralegh  Her Husband's Apparel was much like hers only about his Head he wore a broad Plate of Gold or Copper and his Hair was long but on one Side After this Interview familiar Commerce passed between  the Natives and the  English  who when they went to  Roanoak  were much caress'd and treated by the Lady aforesaid And when she could not prevail with them to stay being but few in Company though the Natives had no Edgetools of Iron or Steel and had proffered a great Box of Pearl for some Armour and a Sword she sent her Women to watch them all Night in their Ships on the Bankside And indeed all the People who saw them admired much at their Ships their Firearms their Cloaths and above all their Complexions for except a Vessel which was cast away with some christian Adventurers about Years before near  Secotan  the southermost Town in  Wingandacoa  never any People in Apparel or of fair Colour were seen or heard of among them which made them wonder so much at the Whiteness of their Skins and so fond of seeing and touching them Under these favourable Recommendations and the Distress which the Natives were in for some powerful Friends to defend them from the Invasions of their Neighbours the Promises of visiting them again wherewith the  English  left them after having learnt as much of the Situation State and Product of the Country as was at this Time convenient were very acceptable So bringing over a Couple of the  Indians  with them named  Manteo  and  Wanchese  to shew them our fine Country they arrived safely in the West of  England  about the Middle of  September  following  When  Ralegh  had laid before her Majesty these and all other Reports most worthy of Notice of this rich beautiful and Virgin Country and had acknowledged how much this hopeful Progress towards the Possession of it was owing to the Auspices of a Virgin Queen she was so well pleased with the Honour and Advantage it promised and gave  him such Encouragement to compleat the Discovery which he forthwith prepared to do by another Expedition that she called it herself by the Name of  Virginia  About two Months after he was elected a Knight of the Shire for the County of  Devon  Sir  William Courtenay  being the other Representative There was then a Clerk of the Parliament so very indolent or otherwise indisposed that the Transactions of the House of Commons at this Time were very imperfectly recorded Yet we find  Ralegh  mentioned to have been chosen of the Committees upon some Bills that were then read On the th of  December  following the Bill in Confirmation of his Patent aforesaid for the Discovery of Foreign Countries was read the first Time In the Afternoon it was read the second Time and committed to the Vicechamberlain  Hatton  Secretary  Walsingham  Sir  Philip Sidney  Sir  Francis Drake  Sir  Richard Greenfield  or  Grenvill  Sir  William Courtenay  Sir  William Mohun  and others Three Days after the said Bill was without any Alteration ordered to be engrossed The next Day it was read the third Time when it passed the House Between this Time and the th of  February  following he received the Honour of Knighthood for being then in a Committee for considering after what Manner and Measure they should supply her Majesty by Subsidy This is the earliest Time I meet with of his being stiled Sir  Walter Ralegh  a Title which her Majesty bestowed as all others of Honour with Frugality and Choice Therefore was it a more certain Cognizance of Virtue or Valour than Titles of more pompous Denomination in the Reign of her Successor who suffered Lucre to corrupt the noble Fountain to turn it into vulgar Channels and drain it even to the  Dregs  Sir  Edward Walker  Garter and Secretary of War to King  Charles  I observes  'That in all Queen  Elizabeth  's Years Reign she created but six Earls and eight or nine Barons So that when she died the Nobility consisted but of one Marquis Earls two Viscounts and about Barons But doubts whether in the Reign of King  James  the Dispensing of Honours so liberally was not one of the Beginnings of general Discontents especially among Persons of great Extraction So that when this King died having reigned but Years he left the Nobility in his three Kingdoms above double the Number to what he found them though his Reign was peaceable and not full of Action which renders Men in Capacity highly to merit from their Prince and so without Envy receive Advancement'  And a little further  'When Alliance to a Favourite Riches though gotten in a Shop Persons of private Estates and of Families that many of them and their Fathers would have thought themselves highly honoured to have been but Knights in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time were advanced then the Fruits thereof began to appear c'  Nay that this Honour was intended by that Queen as the most significant Testimony of personal Desert may be instanced according to an ingenious Observer of her Reign  in Sir  Francis Vere  a Man nobly descended and Sir  Walter Ralegh  exactly qualified says he with many others set apart in her Judgment for military Services whose Titles she never raised above Knighthood saying when importuned to make  Vere  a Baron That in his proper Sphere and her Estimation he was above it already  About the Time that her Majesty granted  Ralegh  the Patent abovecited for the Discovery of remote Countries she seems also to have given him another to license the Vending of Wines throughout the Kingdom that he might be better able to sustain the great Charges which the other brought upon him There were no Restrictions belike in this Patent from increasing the Number of Vintners in any Part of the Realm And hence arose his Controversy at this Time with one of the Universities  For  Ralegh  having by Virtue of that general Patent given Licence to one  John Keymer  to sell Wine in  Cambridge  some of the hotter Heads especially the other Vintners there among whom was  Baxter  a 'Squire Beadle licensed to sell Wine by that University opposed this  Keymer  and his Wife with such Violence that she was likely to have died Complaint being made to  Ralegh  he wrote a Letter to  The worshipful Dr  Howland  Vicechancellor and the Rest of the Masters  to tell them how much he took this riotous Demeanor as a Contempt of the Queen's Grant to him presuming if he had given any unlawful Privilege the Conference he had offered by his Deputies for a quiet Decision of the Matter by learned Council between them would have been accepted Further telling them that if the Abuse was not regulated and the said  Keymer  permitted to enjoy the Liberty granted him he would take some other Course for Reformation therein but resting assured they would use such means as might occasion no further Trouble he not desiring to execute his Grant to its Extent among their Vintners who were the only Disturbers herein respecting more their own Gain than quiet Government he only craves their Answer and that the riotous Persons might not rest unpunished So bids them heartily farewel from his Lodgings at the Court the th of  July  and subscribes himself  Your very affectionate loving Friend  This producing no Answer in seven Months and  Ralegh  having heard they continued to oppress  Keymer  he wrote again  To his loving Friend the Vicechancellor  c telling him that being by Information perswaded himself with the grave and welldisposed of the University were so grieved with the unseemly Outrages lately committed by the young and unbridled Heads thereof to  the Contempt of the Queen's Prerogative and his Discredit as sufficient Order had been taken for the Bearer's Quiet which caused him to rest from requiring Reformation therein at his good Lordtreasurer's Hands who as yet understood nothing from him of these Riots through the Goodwill he bore to their University And that he meant so to deal with them for the other four Taverns as should sufficiently have contented them But his too favourable Dealing with them had given such Encouragement as that intending further to disturb the Bearer they had warned him to appear before them with which he had persuaded him to comply Upon their sending no Answer to this and  Ralegh  hearing they had suddenly clapped up the Man in Prison he sent Days after the last his third Letter from the Court directed  To the Vicechancellor and the rest of the Masters  c And herein tells them he cannot a little marvel at their peremptory and proud Manner of Dealing That he was content to use all Manner of Courtesy towards them in Respect of his honourable good Lord the Lordtreasurer but perceived his reasonable or rather too submiss Dealing had bred in them a Proceeding unsufferable having committed a poor Man to Prison for doing nothing but what was warranted by the great Seal of  England  which supposing they had a Charter he knew not that any Man or Society would so much take upon them to do before a Trial  As I reverence the Place  says he  of which you are the Governors so I will not willingly take any Wrong or Disgrace from you  But as he was assured the Lordtreasurer would be indifferent in the Case and as the Matter so much concerned the Validity of his Patent elsewhere as well as in their University he would try the utmost of his Right as well for this one wherewith  he was content to have been satisfied as for all the other four So having thought they would have vouchsafed him an Answer to his last Letters he ends subscribing himself  Your Friend as you shall gave Cause  This rous'd them to some Consideration and soon after a handsome apologetical Letter was sent from the  Vicechancellor to Sir  W Ralegh setting forth that the hard Opinion he had conceived of them for this Matter made them doubt what Manner of Answer they might address to him without Offence and that their Silence was so ill taken they knew not how their Endeavours to excuse it might give him Satisfaction That they had not neglected any reasonable Means to procure his Favour for the quiet Enjoyment of that whereof they had the Fruition for above two hundred Years nor omitted to become Petitioners to him in a very humble Manner That his Counsel had not made any just Exception against their Charters and those who had the Hearing of the Case thought them to have the better Warrant Yet that he used such hard Terms as they little looked for at his Hands  being by Birth a Gentleman by Education trained up to the Knowledge of good Letters instructed with the liberal Disposition of a University the Fountain and Nursery of all Humanity and further by God's good Blessing advanc'd in Court from whence the very Name of Courtesy is drawn  That the Prejudice he apprehended from their Example against his Patent was unlikely to fall out since other Places were not privileged as the Universities were That her Majesty's Grant by her Prerogative gave him his Title and the like Prerogative was the Ground of their Charters And as he would think it hard to have his Patent impeach'd by an Aftergrant they hoped he would with like Equity measure them who were warranted  to have the sole Dealing with all Vintners in  Cambridge  Town and the Precincts thereof Touching the Imprisonment of the Party whom he charged them with proceeding against before Trial and who according to Mr  Brown  's Promise to the Lordtreasurer was to have given over at  Michaelmas  last however the Course thereof had been otherwise reported to him it was only at this Time to correct his Contempt in not appearing being lawfully warned and refusing to answer before the ordinary Judge or enter Bond for Appearance when Cause should require That for their own Part it would be no Disadvantage whether he or other one or many were Vintners there but in Regard of the Youth committed to their Charge Duty bound them to consider who they admitted to keep Taverns the Number whereof was also limited which if they exceeded would endanger their Privileges for the Preservation whereof as they had all taken a special Oath so they right humbly  eftsoons  beseech'd him to have Regard of them for their Duties therein Concluding thus  Whatever Kindness you shall any Ways shew to the University as the Body thereof doth still continue so the Memory thereof cannot decay There is not one of us but you may readily command wherein it may please you to employ us only we pray you and that in the heartiest Manner to vouchsase us your Favour in Matter of our Privileges  That we may leave them in no worse Estate to our Posterity than we did receive them of our Predecessors  Thus desiring God so to direct you with his blessed Spirit as may be most to his Glory and your greatest Comfort we take our Leave from  Cambridge This might probably pacify  Ralegh  at present both for their Neglect in not answering his Letters and their Forwardness in imprisoning  the Man till the Difference was a few Months afterwards accommodated by the Lordtreasurer who was Chancellor of that University  For the said Lordtreasurer  Burghley  sent in a Letter to Dr  Norgate  his Vice chancellor on the th of  July  the Opinion of the two chief Justices Sir  Christopher Wraye  and Sir  Edmond Anderson  upon this Controversy between that University and Mr  Rawlie  as he is therein call'd for the Nomination of Vintners and setting the Price of Wine there which Opinion is as follows  "First touching the Nomination of Vintners there we think it appertaineth to the University by Usage and Charters from her Majesty confirmed by Parliament and that Mr  Rawlie  can nominate none there For the Price it seemeth they may set Prices so as it be according to the Statute and not otherwise And if the Vintners set at higher Prices they are to be punished by Law Which Penalty Mr  Rawlie  may dispense withal and yet cannot sue for the Penalty by his Patent against the Statute Laws for therein all Liberties to the University is excepted"  After this we hear no more of the Dispute  The Parliament being soon after on the th of  March  prorogued  Ralegh  appears several Ways engag'd in the laudable Improvements of Navigation For his Brother  Adrian Gilbert  of  Sandridge  afterwards knighted in Pursuance of the Arguments laid down by his Brother Sir  Humphrey  having been at great Charges in finding out the Northern Passage to  China  and the  Moluccas  and in Consideration thereof been granted a Patent by the Queen two Years before this Time to pursue the Discovery by Partners under the Title of  The Colleagues of the Fellowship for the Discovery of the Northwest Passage Ralegh  was now one of the Associates in this Enterprize and after having duly consulted about the likeliest Means to Success and liberally contributed towards the Expence they chose Captain  John Davis  an experienced Navigator to be Undertaker of the Exploit He set first out upon it this Summer from  Falmouth  in  two Barks When he came to Land sixtysix Degrees forty Minutes Latitude he anchor'd in a very fair Road under a brave Mountain which for the splendid Appearance it made the Cliffs thereof being as orient as Gold they named  Mount Ralegh  in Honour of their Proprietor and soon after fell into the very Passage they sought since well known by the Name of  Davis's Streights  The farther Search whereof through the same Patronage and Support Captain  Davis  made in two Voyages more the two following Years and in a Manner compleated the said Discovery  But about two Months before  Davis  begun his said first Voyage for this Discovery  Ralegh  sent out his own Fleet for  Virginia  which consisted of seven Sail whereof some were his own Ships and they departed from  Plymouth  on the th of  April  the Year above specified He deputed his gallant Relation Sir  Richard Greenville  General of the Expedition and Mr  Ralph Lane  who was afterwards knighted to be Governor of the Colony which they now transported There went besides Mr  Thomas Candish John Arundel Raymond Stucley Bremige Vincent  Mr  John Clark  and several others whereof some were Captains and others Assistants for Council and Direction in the Voyage So they shaped their Course to the  Canary  Islands from thence to  Dominica  and to the Island of St  John de Puerto Rico  where they were sadly stung with the  Musketoes  and near which they took two  Spanish  Frigats one whereof was freighted with a rich Cargo and divers  Spaniards  of Distinction who afterwards were ransom'd for good round Sums of Money Then they made away to  Hispaniola  soon after which the General and some of his Company were near being cast away in catching of  Seals  From thence they sailed to  Florida  One Argument used by a l  te Author to prove this was the first Attempt made for the Discovery of these Parts of  America  is that these Navigators  "knew no other Way to sail from  England  to the Coast of  Virginia  than to go first to the  Canaries  from thence to  Hispaniola  and into the Gulph of  Mexico  then out by  Cuba  and the Gulph of  Bahama  and so coast along the Shore from  Florida  to  Virginia  from the Latitude of Minutes to which is in short says he like going from  London  by  Portsmouth  and from thence to  Exeter  away to  Bristol  and so up by the Banks of the  Severn  to come at  WestChester  "  and on the th of  June  anchor'd at  Wocoken  where they sent Word of their Arrival to King  Wingina  at  Roanoak  They carried the  Indians  with them from  England  and  Manteo  on the th of  July  led Mr  Arundel  to the main Continent where they found some of their Men who had been conducted thither twenty Days before by Captain  Raymond  On the eleventh following the General accompanied by  Arundel Stuckley Lane Candish Hariot Amadas Clark  and others passed over the Water to the main Land and victuall'd their Ships in which Voyage they first discover'd the Towns of  Pomeioc Aquasgococ  and  Secotan  also the great Lake  Paquipe  and many other Places then return'd to their Fleet They afterwards revisited those Parts and were kindly entertained by the Savages Coming at last to Anchor to  Hatorask  Prince  Grangino  or  Granganimeo  before mentioned came attended by  Manteo  to visit them on board the Admiral which was named the  Tyger  The Particulars which passed between them about the Settlement are not mentioned in the short Journal of this Voyage but we may conclude it was agreed on to their mutual Satisfaction since one hundred and seven Men whose Names are printed at the End of the said Journal under the  Government of Mr  Lane  were left for a Year in the Country without Disturbance to begin the Plantation On the th of  August  the General weighed Anchor and set Sail for  England  about six Days after he took a  Spanish  Ship of three hundred Ton richly laden and on the th of  October  arrived with the Prize at  Plymouth  where he was courteously received by his worshipful Friend  An End having been put to the  Munster  Rebellion by Force of Arms and the Country further laid desolate by a raging Famine which devour'd what the Sword had left except a few who remained in Cities fled to  England  or could feed upon Weeds and Carrion so as even to rob the Graves and the Gibbets of the Dead to keep the dying alive the Queen soon became desirous of repeopling the Country and to have Ways consider'd▪ on how the late Earl of  Desmond  's large Territories in  Ireland  might be disposed of to the Advantage of her and her Subjects After Commissioners were sent over for this Purpose and proper Methods taken to prevent frudulent Conveyances by the Rebels there was at last a Scheme resolv'd on for the Plantation of  Munster  and Secretary  Fenton  carried over the Instructions towards the latter End of this Year The whole Forfeiture was above Acres of Land and after some Restitutions had been made the Remainder was divided into  Seigniories  among certain  Gentlemanundertakers  as they were called but chiefly such as had been instrumental in appeasing the  Irish  Rebellion One of the largest Divisions which was twelve thousand Acres situate in the Counties of  Cork  and  Waterford  was given by her Majesty to Sir  Walter Ralegh  and his Heirs with certain Privileges and Immunities upon those Conditions of planting and improving the same to which the  rest were also obliged And tho' many of the  Undertakers  did not people their  Seigniories  with wellaffected  English  but sold them to  English  Papists or otherwise to their Profit nor fortified according to their Covenants nor forbore encroaching upon the Lands of the loyal and protected  Irish  as the Crown on the other Side fail'd of maintaining certain Forces promis'd for their Security from fresh Invasions yet I meet with none of those Irregularities objected to  Ralegh  on the contrary that he peopled his Plantation unexceptionably that he kept the said Estate to the latter End of the Queen's Reign and then sold it to  Richard Boyle  afterwards the famous Earl of  Cork  as in a Memorial of his own Life the said Earl has related But as capacious as this Benefit seemed it was rather expensive perhaps at first than profitable to him  For Sir  Richard Greenvil  who at his Departure from  Virginia  had promised the Colony he left behind to return punctually with Supplies by the following  Easter  at furthest was not altogether so expeditious as they expected probably through some Difficulties attending the Charge thereof which  Ralegh  's new Undertaking of planting also that Seigniory might probably render more burdensome  Greenvil  brought over Letters from Governor  Lane  to a very worthy Encourager of all naval Adventurers describing the Commodities and Fertility of the Country they were about to cultivate and civilize the said Governor also drew up Notes while he was there which he afterwards methodized into a Discourse of two Parts displaying the  Particularities of the Country of  Virginia  and the Reasons which moved their Departure from thence into  England In this Discourse we learn that their Discovery for Sir  Walter Ralogh  had extended from  Roanoak  southward as far as  Secotum  abovt eighty  Miles Northward as far as the  Chesepians  being a hundred and thirty Miles more and to the North west as far as  Chawanook  a hundred and thirty Miles and further mentions many Towns about the Waterside discovered by the Way It also informs us of his Enquiries after a Fishery and Traffick for Pearl in those Parts besides a Mine of strange Metal like Copper but paler and softer moreover of the taking Prince  Skyco  Prisoner and after the Death of  Granganimeo  aforesaid how his Brother King  Wingina  changed his Name and plotted an Insurrection against the  English  for which he lost his Life while another King called  Okisco  sent to pay Homage and acknowledge Subjection to the grand  Weroanza  or Queen of  England  and after her to Sir  Walter Ralegh▪  Lastly the Arrival of Sir  Francis Drake  about the th of  June  who returning from his prosperous Conquest of  St Domingo Cartagena  and  St Augustine  determined in his Way homeward to visit his Friend's Colony in  Virginia  They had despaired of Sir  Richard Greenvil  's Promise and the rather because of the Preparations then making for  Flanders  and other Parts of  America  Their Corn was indeed within a Fortnight of inviting the Sickle but they were in Need of many other Provisions Hereupon  Drake  readily proffer'd them all Manner of Supplies by Victuals Men Ammunition and Ships to carry on and compleat their worthy Undertaking The Governor desired only a Ship and so much Provision as about  August  would carry him and his Company to  England  which  Drake  granted in full Sufficiency besides Pinnaces Boats and two experienced Masters or Pilots to abide with them and apply themselves earnestly in the Action All this was performed in two Days On the next Day  while some were writing Letters into  England  and others relating their Adventures to each other some at Sea some on Shore there arose a most violent Tempest which lasted three Days drove most of the Fleet from their Anchors away to Sea and in them the Provisions and Masters aforesaid with the chief of the  English  Colony who they saw no more till they met in  England  Then  Drake  proffer'd them another Ship but the rest of the Colony who were left behind all begg'd to go for  England  to which  Drake  consenting took them aboard on the th of  July  and set Sail Sir  Walter Ralegh  had in the mean Time provided a Ship of a hundred Ton freighted with all Kind of Provisions in a most plentiful Manner for the Relief of this Colony but not sailing till after  Easter  the said Colony was newly departed before this fresh Supply arrived at  Virginia  After some Time spent upon the Country in seeking the Colony and not finding it they returned with all the Provision aforesaid into  England  About a Fortnight after Sir  Richard Greenvil  arrived at  Virginia  with three Ships more well stored for the same Company of Planters but he after much Search missing also of them and of the aforesaid Ship left fifteen Men at  Roanoak  with Plenty of Supplies and made for  England  and not without some Conquests over the  Spaniards  at the  Azores  in his Return And indeed  Ralegh  was also about this very Time victorious at the same Place for when he sent the aforesaid Ship to relieve the Colony or soon after he dispatched two more named the  Serpent  and  MarySpark  both of them his own to the  Azores  against the  Spaniards  under the Conduct of Captain  Jacob Whiddon John Evesham  and others They departed from  Plymouth  on the th of  June  aforesaid and took more  Spanish  Prizes than they  could bring home In one of them was the Governor of St  Michael  's Island in another which they took near the Isle of  Graciosa  was the famous  Pedro de Sarmiento  Governor of the Streights of  Magellan  who was the furthest and most experienced Navigator in all  Spain  While this  Sarmiento  was  Ralegh  's Prisoner in  England  they were one Day surveying a Map together concerning which  Sarmiento  told him a pleasant Story of  the Painter's Wives Island  which  Ralegh  afterwards ingenicusly applied where he compares the Liberties of  local  and  historical  Fiction of such as  Geographers  make in filling up the blank Spaces of their  Maps  with Lands of  Pigmeys  and Rocks of Loadstone to those of  Historians  in repairing the broken Accounts of  past Ages  yet concludes with an encouraging Difference against the ignorant Describers of remote Places▪ in Favour of liberal Conjecture to enlighten the Obscurities of antient Times See the  History of the World  Lib Cap Sec  They took also three other Vessels but turned two adrift after having taken out of them what they wanted because they could not spare Hands to man them and after a Fight for thirtytwo Hours with two great Carracks and the other Guardships of twenty Sail more richly laden they gave over for Want of Powder and returned safe to  Plymouth  where they were received with triumphant Joy then proceeding to  Southampton  they were met by their Owner Sir  Walter Ralegh  who rewarded them with their Shares out of the Merchandize and other Commodities of Value which in those three Prizes were thus taken from the Enemy Not long after this there was another Voyage set out the same Year by the Earl of  Cumberland  to the  SouthSea  but performed no further than the Latitude of fortyfour Degrees to the South of the Equinoctial in which as Sir  Walter Ralegh  was also an Adventurer his fine Pinnace named  Dorothy  being engaged therein and some small  Prizes also being taken he had no Doubt his Proportion in the Profits that arose from them  But to return to the  Virginian  Colony it arrived at  Plymouth  on the th of  July  following  Camden  has remember'd that by this Colony of  Ralegh  's and in those Ships of  Drake  's the famous  American  Plant called TOBACCO was first brought into  England  by or under Governor  Lane  doubtless according to the Instructions they had received of their Proprietor for the Introduction among us of that Commodity is generally ascribed to  Ralegh  himself There are some pleasant Stories of this Plant with Relation to him which have been as carefully preserved as the Box he kept it in  Being at  Leeds  in  Yorkshire  soon after Mr  Ralph Thoreshy  the Antiquary died  Anno  I saw his  Musaeum  and in it among his other Rarities what himself has publickly call'd in the Catalogue thereof annex'd to his Antiquities of that Town Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Tobacco box From the best of my Memory I can resemble its outward Appearance to nothing more nearly than one of our modern Muffcases about the same Height and Width covered with red Leather and opened at Top but with a Hinge I think like one of those In the Inside there was a Cavity for a Receiver of Glass or Metal which might hold half a Pound or a Pound of Tobacco and from the Edge of the Receiver at Top to the Edge of the Box a circular Stay or Collar with Holes in it to plant the Tobacco about with six or eight Pipes to smoke it in This travelling Box with the Manuscripts Medals and other Rarities in its Company descending to a young Clergyman the Son of the deceased was soon after reported to have been translated to  London  But the Tradition of  Ralegh's smoaking Tobacco at first privately in his Study and of the Servant who used to wait on him there surprising him one Time with his Tankard of Ale and Nutmeg as he was intent upon his Book before he had done his Pipe and seeing the Smoke reeking out of his Mouth threw all the Ale in his Face then running down Stairs alarmed the Family with repeated Exclamations that  his Master was on Fire and before they could get up would be burnt to Ashes This I say if true has nothing in it of more surprising or unparallel'd Simplicity than there was in that poor  Norwegian  who upon the first Sight of  Roses  could not be induced to touch tho' he saw them grow being so amazed to behold Trees budding with Fire Or to come closer by Way of Retaliation than there was in those  Virginians  themselves who the first Time they seized upon a Quantity of Gunpowder which belonged to the  English  Colony sowed it for Grain or the Seed of some strange Vegetable in the Earth with full Expectation of reaping a plentiful Crop of Combustion by the next Harvest to scatter their Enemies  But passing over these Tales as  Ralegh  was the first who brought this Herb in Request among us and laid the Foundation for that great Traffick therewith which has been of such considerable Benefit to his Country there is no less Honour due to him than has been conferred on that Ambassador who had before brought it out of  Portugal  into  France  where in mentioning the Herb they pay grateful Acknowledgments to the Importer by calling it  Nicotiana  after his own Name Nay his politick Sovereign  Catherine de Medicis  did so zealously encourage the Use of it that it was also afterwards in Honour of her called the  Queen's Herb  Nor was the Queen of  England  backward in listening to and promoting the Advantages it was promised to produce We may gather from some Authors that she was very curious to know its Virtues and Properties and that once conversing with  Ralegh  upon this Subject  He assured her Majesty he had so well experienced the Nature of it that he could tell her of what Weight even the Smoke would be in any Quantity proposed to be consumed  Her Majesty fixing her Thoughts upon the most impracticable Part of the Experiment that of bounding the Smoke in a Ballance suspected that he put the Traveller upon her and would needs lay him a Wager he could not solve the Doubt So he procured a Quantity agreed upon to be thoroughly smoked then went to weighing but it was of the Ashes and in the Conclusion what was wanting in the prime Weight of the Tobacco her Majesty did not deny to have been evaporated in Smoke and further said  that many Labourers in the Fire she had heard of who turned their Gold into Smoke but  Ralegh  was the first who had turned Smoke into Gold Whether those two Queens did ever recommend the Use of this Herb by their own Example we are not certain but it is evident it soon became of such Vogue in Queen  Elizabeth  's Court that some of the great Ladies as well as Noblemen therein would not scruple to take a Pipe sometimes very sociably however it was such an Abomination to the refined Palate of her  Scotch  Successor that he not only refused the Use of it himself but endeavoured to rob his Crown of what has since proved one of its greatest Revenues  An Author of Experience has lately informed us  'That the Benefit of this Vegetable to  Great Britain  is prodigious if we consider the short Time since it was first introduced into  England  by Sir  Walter Ralegh  'Tis now become says he the Staple of two of his Majesty's Colonies inhabited by half a Million of People many of whom could hardly support themselves at Home yet there they live in great Splendor and Ease having sumptuous Buildings rich Equipages Slaves and other Attendance According to the exactest Computation that has been made on this Branch of our Trade about Sail of Ships with above Seamen have been employed in one Year to bring over about Hogsheads of Tobacco from  Virginia  and  Maryland  the Freight of which at  l per  Ton a Medium in Times of Peace amounts to  l  sterling most of which Sum centers among ourselves in the Payment of Sailors and Tradesmen who live by Shipping besides about  s per  Hogshead Customhouse Fees Cooperage Lighterage Wharfage Porterage Cartage Warehouse Rent Brokerage and other incident Charges 'Tis further calculated that out of the said Hogsheads imported there are exported Hogsheads containing  lb per  Hogshead at Fourpence  per  Pound on Board which amounts to  l  towards supporting the Ballance of Trade with foreign Nations'  The same Author a little further observes  'as another great Benefit arising from this Vegetable that the Produce is laid out in our  British  Manufactures and exported to the  British  Colonies which in one Year has amounted to  l  and would be much more if proper Encouragement were given to manufacture it before Exportation therefore it may be justly said that Tobacco is become in few Years one of the most valuable Branches of Trade belonging to  Great Britain  '  Thus far Mr  John Lacy  Tobacco merchant in his  Observations on the Nature Use and Trade of Tobacco  Folio one Sheet printed  Mar  Besides the Advantage this Vegetable is of to  Trade  a large Revenue arises to the Crown  y  Customduties on  TobaccoI have seen an Account upon the Veracity whereof I can depend by which it appears the Money paid on this Article of Tobacco into his Majesty's Exchequer in the Year was  l    s    d  and that a  Medium  for seven Years past to that Time was  l  o  s    d  by restraining his Subjects  also from it Indeed it is not to be wonder'd that such a Philosopher as could magnify the Power of Witches after the Manner he has done in one of his learned Pamphlets should be such a Politician as to discourage the taking of Tobacco in another  Entitled the  Counterblast  to  Tobacco  to without Date There is also extant King  James  's Warrant to the Lordtreasurer  Dorset Anno  for laying a good heavy Imposition upon Tobacco that less Quantity may be brought into the Realm and only sufficient for the better Sort who will use it with Moderation for their Health Wherefore he authorises the said Treasurer to order that from the th of  October  ensuing the proper Officers should take of all who import Tobacco the Sum of six Shillings and eightpence upon every Pound Weight over and above the Custom of Twopence  per  Pound usually paid heretofore  Rymer  's  Foedc  Tom XVI Fol  But those who have not admired  at his Prejudice in this Attempt to dispel the Fumes of that Herb with greater of his own if I may allude to the witty Title of his Performance without Imputation of Irreverence to his Memory may yet applaud his Policy in so far conducing to its Suppression as to exclude it from the Body of his Works when this  Royal Pamphleteer  resolved to become an Author in Folio As for the Uses and Virtues of this Plant since so many learned Writers have given us whole Books upon them I shall only here observe from the first Author among us immediately upon his Return with the Colony aforesaid from  Virginia  where he had been employed by  Ralegh  to survey the Country that the Savages distinguished it by sowing apart from all other Vegetables and held it of highest Estimation in all their Sacrifices by Fire Water and Air either for Thanksgiving to or Pacification of their Gods And as by sucking it through it through Pipes of Clay they purged all gross Humours from the Head and Stomach opened all the Pores and Passages of the Body preserving it from Obstructions or breaking them whereby they notably preserved Health and knew not many grievous Diseases wherewith we in  England  are often afflicted So  we ourselves says he during the Time we were there used to suck it after their Manner as also since our Return and have found many rare and wonderful Experiments of its Virtues whereof the Relation would require a Volume by itself the Use of which by so many Men and Women of great Calling as well as others and some learned Physicians also is sufficient Witness  The learned Author of this Account Mr  Thomas Hariot  having further confuted the Calumnies which had been raised of this new discovered Country by the idle ignorant and avaritious Part of the  Colony lately returned from it and given a faithful Relation of the merchantable Commodities with those fit for Food or Building and an Account of the Natures of the People in three Parts expresses himself towards the Conclusion of the whole in this Manner  Seeing the Air there is so temperate and wholesome the Soil so fertile and yielding such Commodities as I have beforementioned the Voyage also to and fro sufficiently experienced to be performed twice a Year with Ease and at any Season and the Dealings of Sir  Walter Ralegh  so liberal in large giving and granting Lands there as is already known with many Helps and Furtherances else the least that he hath granted having been    Acres to a Man only for the Adventure of his Person I hope  re remains no Cause whereby the Action should be misliked  I remember to have met with a scarce old Tract in the  Lambeth  Library written by a learned and ingenious Author of those Times he adds  Yet you more respecting the good Ends whereunto you levelled your Line for the Good of your Country did not give over 'till you had recovered a Land and had made a Plantation of the People of your own  English  Nation in  Virginia  the first  English  Colony that was ever planted there not a little to the Derogation of the  Spaniards  Glory and Impeachment to their Vaunts who because with all cruel Immanity they subdued a naked and yielding People whom they sought for Gain and not for Religion or the Plantation of a Commonwealth over whom to satisfy their insatiable Covetousness they did most cruelly tyrannise and against the Course of all human Nature scorch and roast them to Death as by their own Histories doth appear These I say do brag and vaunt that they only have drawn strange Nations and unknown People to the Obedience of their Kings to the Knowledge  of Christianity and to the enriching of their Country and thereby claim the Honour to themselves alone But if these your Actions were well looked into and with due Consideration it shall be found much more honourable in sundry Respects for the Advancement of the Name of God the Honour of the Prince and the Benefit of the Commonwealth For what can be more pleasant to God than to gain and reduce in all Christianlike Manner a lost People to the Knowledge of the Gospel and a true Christian Religion than which cannot be a more pleasant and sweet Sacrifice and a more acceptable Service before God And what can be more honourable to Princes than to enlarge the Bounds of their Kingdoms without Injury Wrong and Bloodshed and to frame them from a savage Life to a civil Government neither of which the  Spaniards  in their Conquests have performed And what can be more beneficial to a Commonwealth than to have a Nation and a Kingdom to transfer unto the superfluous Multitude of fruitless and idle People here at Home daily increasing to travel conquer and manure another Land which by the due Intercourses to be devised may and will yield infinite Commodities And how well you do deserve every Way in following so honourable a Course not we ourselves only can witness but strange Nations also do honour you for the same as doth appear by the Epistle of  Bassimerus  of  France  to the History of  Florida  and by  Julius Caesar  a Citizen of  Rome  in his Epistle to his Book intitled  Columbeados To this we may here add the Testimony of  Camden  who speaking of this Undertaking of  Virginia  at the Return of the last Colony sent thither by Sir  Walter Ralegh  says  He was a Man never to be sufficiently commended for the great Pains he took in discovering remote Countries and advancing the Glory of the  English  Navigation  That  Baffimerus  was the learned  Martine Bassaniere  of  Paris  as I find elsewhere with whom  Richard Hakluyt  the worthy Collector of our naval Adventures being acquainted and having procured a very valuable History in Manuscript of the first Discovery of  Florida  about Years before this Time by  Rene Laudonniere  and three other  French  Captains he sent it over to that Monsieur  Bassaniere  who published it from the said  French  Copy this Year at  Paris  and dedicated it as aforesaid to Sir  Walter Ralegh  who as appears above is therein celebrated for I have not yet seen though I have been promised that original  French  Edition But it was translated into  English  the Year following by  Richard Hakluyt  himself who also dedicates it anew to the same Patron And indeed we find  Ralegh  from this Time a very considerable Patron of learned and ingenious Authors not only in History and Geography but Antiquities Chymistry Poetry and other polite Branches of Art and Science for Admiral  Coligny  having sent over with the aforesaid Discoverers of  Florida  a very skilful Artist from  France  to take Draughts of whatever he found observable and worthy of Representation in the said Country which he did not only among the animal and vegetable Rarities thereof but also it seems from the Customs of the Natives and historical Events among the Discoverers themselves This Painter living afterwards in  London  at or before the Publication of those Discoveries was supported by  Ralegh  in the great Expence of publishing also his Draughts and Descriptions For  Hakluyt  among other Reasons for not particularizing the Commodities of those Parts the Accidents of the  Frenchmens  Government therein the Causes of their good and bad Success with  the Surprises made by their Enemies tells  Ralegh  he does not reckon them up again  the rather because the same with divers other Things of chiefest Importance are lively drawn in Colours at your no small Charges by the skilful Painter  James Morgues  sometime living in  BlackFriars London  whom Monsieur  Chastillion  then Admiral of  France  sent thither to  Florida  with  Laudoniere  for that Purpose which Painter was an Eyewitness of the Goodness and Fertility of those Regions and hath put down in Writing many Singularities which are not mentioned in this Treatise and which he hath since published together with the Portraitures  Hereunto we may further add that there was about this Time also another Book dedicated to  Ralegh in Praise of Musick  wherein besides the Antiquity and Dignity thereof is declared the sober and lawful Use of the same in the Congregation and Church of God  I apprehend there was a greater Propriety in the Publisher's Choice of this Patron to that Work than is now commonly known for I have somewhere met with Hints that Sir  Walter Ralegh  was a great Proficient in Musick either vocal instrumental or both whence we might be somewhat induced to construe some Lines of  Spenser  's concerning him hereafter quoted in the literal Sense  About this Time it was her Majesty conferred upon him some Preferments but of Honour more than Profit perhaps to him For  Hooker  in the Dedication of his  Irish  History dated the th of  October  this Year superscribes it to the right worthy and honourable Gentleman Sir  Walter Ralegh  Knt  Seneschal  of the Dutchies of  Cornwall  and  Exeter  and Lordwarden of the Stannaries in  Devon  and  Cornwall  There is in Being an old Manuscript List of the Officers in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time and their  Fees  in which I find that as Officer of the Coinage of Tin and Steward of the Stannaries in the Dutchy of  Cornwall  Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Fee was  l    s    d Cotton  Libr  To these Dignities I presume he was then but newly advanced because the said Historian in the Body of the Dedication begs Leave to remember  How it hath pleased God to bring you says he into the Favour of your Prince and Sovereign who besides her great Favour towards you many Ways hath also laid upon you the Charge of a Government in your own Country where you are to command many People by your honourable Office of the Stannary and where you are both a Judge and a Chancellor to rule in Justice and to judge in Equity  How  Ralegh  used this Favour and what Usage it also procured him the same Dedication does somewhat further reveal in these Words  It is well known that it had been no less easy for you than for such as have been advanced by Kings to have builded great Houses purchased large Circuits and to have used the Fruits of Princes Favours as most Men in all former and present Ages have done had you not preferred the general Honour and Commodity of your Prince and Country before all that is private whereby you have been rather a Servant than a Commander to your own Fortune  The Earl of  Essex  had now been near a Twelvemonth abroad under his Fatherinlaw  Leicester  Governor of the  Netherlands  was but nineteen Years of Age when he went over being his first Engagement in any publick Action yet no less than a General of the Horse and before that as himself says  he had small Grace and few Friends at Court  On the th of  December  the Earl of  Leicester  and his Train with an Army of about Men set out from  Harwich  in Sail of Ships to his Government of the  Netherlands  and it was committed as absolutely to him as it had been to the Emperor  Charles  V But at last the  Hollanders  growing jealous of his Authority and complaining of certain Innovations Factions and treacherous Commanders under him he was recalled and returned to  London  the d of  November  this following Year soon after the Corpse of his much lamented Nephew Sir  Philip Sidney  not without leaving behind a printed Vindication of himself in  Dutch  now scarce to be found and striking a Medal representing his own Head on one Side and seven unguarded straggling Sheep on the other The Author of a brief Discourse of Dr  Allen  's seditious Drifts c to p endeavours to clear the Earl's Conduct in that Government against the said Doctor as  E Cliffe  in his Breviate of  Holland  's Deliverance and Ingratitude to the Crown of  England  and the House of  Nassau  to p does against  Vander Sande  and  Hugo Grotius  especially the latter who insinuates as if the Earl who died within two Years following was poisoned by his Wife because she soon after married again I have read this Earl's Effects were then seized upon by the Crown for Debt and heard that an Inventory of them is in the Possession of Sir  John Evelyn  Bart  So that it must be now after their Return  that  Leicester  set him up a Competitor against  Ralegh  as we are before informed out of Sir  Henry Wotton  But  Leicester  as great as his Power was could no more bridle the licentious Reflections of the Populace than  Ralegh  an Instance whereof we have from some antient Authority it seems tho' in a modern Author who speaking of  Tarleton the best Comedian of these Times in  England  tells us that when a pleasant Play he had made was acting before her Majesty he pointed at Sir  Walter Ralegh  and said  See the Knave commands the Queen  for which she corrected him with a Frown yet he had the Confidence to add that he was of too much and too intolerable a Power and going on with the same Liberty he reflected on the over great Power and Riches of the Earl of  Leicester  which was so universally applauded by all who were present that she thought fit at that Time to bear these Reflections with  a seeming Unconcernedness but yet was so offended that she forbad  Tarleton  and all her Jesters from coming near her Table being inwardly displeased with this impudent and unreasonable Liberty Ralegh  seems to have little regarded these Aspersions but constantly attended his publick Charge and Employments whether in Town or Country as Occasion called him Accordingly we find him the latter End of this Year in Parliament where among other weighty Concerns the Fate of  Mary  Queen of  Scots  was determined There is nothing particular upon Record in the Journals of the House of Commons of  Ralegh  's Opinion in this Matter nor indeed any Debates upon the Sentence that had been pronounced against that Queen For on the th of  November  a Petition agreed upon in both Houses was presented to Queen  Elizabeth  by the Speaker  Puckering  the Privycouncil and a Body of the Commons joined with the Lord Chancellor  Bromley  and twenty other temporal Lords for the speedy Execution of the said Queen of  Scots  in Consideration of the treasonable and rebellious Practices wherewith she had been proved to endanger this Realm and its Ruler The said Petition was immediately printed and that Queen in less than three Months after executed He was appointed one of the Committee to confer upon the Amendment of some Things whereunto the Clergy were required to be sworn and that some good Course might be taken to have a learned Ministry for the Queen had in her Speech at the Close of the last Sessions told the Bishops of some Faults and Negligences  which if you my Lords of the Clergy  said she  do not amend I mean to depose you  Now  Ralegh  resolving to persevere in planting his Country of  Virginia  prepared a new Colony of one hundred and fifty Men to be sent thither under  the Charge of Mr  John White  whom he appointed Governor and with him twelve Assistants to whom he gave a Charter and incorporated them by the Name of the Governor and Assistants of the City of  Ralegh  in  Virginia  Their Fleet consisting of three Sail departed from  Portsmouth  on the th of  April  and in less than three Months following arrived safe at  Hatorask  from whence they went to the Isle of  Roanoak  to look for the fifteen Men left there by Sir  Richard Greenvil  the Year before meaning from thence to pass to the Bay of  Chesepiock  where they intended to make their Seat and Fort according to the Charge given them by Sir  Walter Ralegh  But when they came to the North part of the Island where Governor  Lane  had bu lt his Fort they found it razed and the Groundrooms of the Dwellinghouses which had been also erected about it inhabited by Deer and overgrown with Melons or such like Sort of Fruit which those Animals broozed upon At  Croatoan  they were very well received and entertained by the Natives thro' the Means of  Manteo  their Countryman Of these they learnt that the  Englishmen  they were seeking had been treacherously set upon by a Party of the Savages who wounded some of them and drove the rest to some remote and obscure Parts of the Country On the th of  August  their Friend  Manteo  was according to the Commands of Sir  Walter Ralegh  christned in  Roanoak  and called Lord thereof and of  Dasamonguepeuk  in Reward of his faithful Services Three Days after the Governor's Daughter  Eleanor  Wife of  Ananias Dare  one of the Assistants was delivered of a Daughter in  Roanoak  and the Infant was christned there the Sunday following who because she was the first  Creolian  or Christian born in that Country was baptized by the Name  of  Virginia  Now having reestablished their Interest and Alliance with the Natives as far as this short Interview would permit and delivered their Ships of the Provisions for the Colony the Planters began to consider they should be in Want of fresh Supplies therefore upon some Difference about choosing a Factor to return for that Purpose into  England  they unanimously petitioned the Governor to return himself to which he at last consented and the Ships with some few of the Company arrived in  England  not without Storms Sickness and the Death of several of them by other like Casualties about the latter End of the same Year  It was but five Days after the going forth of this second Colony that Mr  Richard Hakluyt  dedicated his Translation of the Voyages to  Florida  before mentioned to the Right Honourable Sir  Walter Ralegh  as he stiles him Captain of her Majesty's Guard Lordwarden of the Stannaries and her Highness's Lieutenantgeneral of the County of  Cornwall  In this Dedication it will somewhat appear that neither the Returns which might have been made by any merchantable Products in  Virginia  nor the Profits arising to him from any  Spanish  Prizes which had been taken at Sea were equivalent to the great Expences he had been at in settling this Plantation and further that he had received no particular or private Assistance in this Enterprize from the Queen because his Hopes therein and her Majesty's Regard thereof are so handsomely excited by the said Author  Here this Author illustrates his Address by these Examples  "The  Spaniards  at their first Entrance into  Hispaniola  found neither Sugarcanes nor Ginger growing there nor any King of our Cattle but finding the Place fit for Pasture they sent Kine and Bulls and sundry other profitable Beasts thither and transported the Plants of Sugarcanes and set the Roots of Ginger the Hides of which Oxen with the Sugar and Ginger are now the chief Merchandize of that Island The  Portugals  also at their first Footing in  Madera  as  John Barras  writes in his first  Decade  found nothing there but mighty Woods for Timber whereupon they called the Island by that Name howbeit the Clime being favourable they inriched it by their own Industry with the best Wines and Sugars in the World The like Manner of Proceeding they used in the Isles of the  Azores  by sowing therein great Quantity of Woad So they dealt in  St Thomas  under the  Equinoctial  and in  Brasile  and in sundry other Places"  But the Ships in which this second Colony was transported had not been many Days returned into  England  before we find  Ralegh  's Thoughts diverted for a while from planting in a foreign Country and engaged upon Schemes of displanting rather those powerful Enemies who were preparing to root themselves in his own For the Rumour grew stronger every Day of such a mighty Fleet threatning us as if all  Spain  and  Rome  were to land upon our little Island and overrun the whole Kingdom The Queen and her Privycouncil therefore no longer delayed all proper Means for the Defence of the Realm but out of all her Commanders by Land and Sea appointed those of most approved Abilities in naval and military Affairs as well as of the greatest Authority in their respective Counties to hold Consultations for the Security of her Person her People and their Possessions And as there were such Consultations distinctly held by the most ancient and experienced Commanders at Sea so we find by the like Appointment a Council of War also held on the th of  November  this Year by others of highest Repute for their Knowledge how to put the Forces of the Realm in the best Order to withstand any Invasion by Land For this Purpose were chosen the Lord  Grey  Sir  Francis Knolles  Sir  Thomas Leighton  Sir  Walter Ralegh  Sir  John Norris  Sir  Richard Greenvil  Sir  Richard Bingham  Sir  Roger Williams  and  Ralph Lane  Esq Of their Determinations in this important Council I have a Manuscript drawn up perhaps by Sir  Walter Ralegh  himself the said Draught being annexed to another Manuscript now before me which was apparently of his composing  Besides this grand Scheme for the Safeguard of the Kingdom in general  Ralegh  seems to have had some special Regard to several particular Places For there has been found among the Lord  Burghley  's Papers  a Remembrance for the Lordtreasurer touching the Request of  Sir  W R  dated it seems this Year which makes Request for five Pieces of Brass Cannon lying at  Woolwich  also for Letters to the Marquis of  Winchester  Lieutenant of  Dorsetshire  for a hundred Men and Arms to defend the Castle and Island of  Portland  with a Supply of Powder there being but one  last  Further for Removal of the unserviceable Ordnance there to  London  and that the Lord Marquis would give Order for his said hundred Men by his Commission directed to the Lieutenant of  Portland  and he will undertake to collect Men of Sufficiency not of the trained Number Lastly for his Lordship's good Remembrance for the Towns of  Weymouth  and  MelcombRegis  From whence my Author is not only inclined to believe this Paper was sent by Sir  Walter Ralegh  but that he was now Governor of  Portland  Castle and had those Towns under his Care We may indeed hence believe this Paper was written by him and that he not only took those Places but several others under his Consideration that they might be put in the best State of Defence but that he was now Governor of  Portland  Castle or limited to the Defence  of that Place at the Time of the Invasion as might be imply'd from my Author seems not very consistent with his Lieutenancy in the West  But as much engaged as  Ralegh  seems at this Time to have been for the Safety of the Kingdom he found some Interval to consider also upon Means for the Relief of his Colony for after Governor  White  returned and had delivered him his Letters with other Advertisements concerning his late Voyage and the State of the Planters in  Virginia Ralegh  immediately appointed a Pinnace to be sent thither with all such Provisions as he apprehended they might want and also wrote Letters to them promising that he would prepare a good Supply of Shipping and Men with all other Necessaries to be with them the Summer following This Pinnace and Fleet he accordingly prepared at  Biddeford  in the West of  England  under the Command of Sir  Richard Greenvil  and all Things being now ready they waited only for a fair Wind In the mean Time the Alarm so increas'd throughout all  England  of that vast and formidable Armament made by the King of  Spain  under the Sanction of the Pope's  Crusado  for the Invasion and Conquest of the whole Island that most of the Ships of War then in any Readiness received Orders from the State to attend in their Harbours for the Defence of their own Country and Sir  Richard Greenvil  was personally commanded not to depart out of  Cornwall  Governor  White  nevertheless labour'd so earnestly for the Relief of the Colony that he obtain'd two small Pinnaces called the  Brave  and the  Roe  wherein fifteen Planters and all convenient Provisions for those who winter'd in the Country were transported but the Names of the Captains who commanded those Vessels are not remember'd On the d of  April  they put  over the Bar at  Biddeford  and the same Night came to Anchor at the Isle of  Lundy  but the Company minding more to make a gainful Voyage than a safe one run in Chase of Prizes 'till at last one of them was met with by a Couple of strong Men of War of  Rochelle  about Leagues to the NorthEast of  Madera  where after a bloody Fight the  English  were beaten boarded and rifled But it is observable the  French  Men were so immoderate in possessing themselves of their Spoil that by overloading the Boats with the Freight of the  English  Ships they sunk what they were too eager to share In this maimed ransacked and ragged Condition the said Ship returned to  England  in a Month's Time and about three Weeks after returned the other having perhaps tasted of the same Fare at least without performing the intended Voyage to the Distress of the Planters abroad and Displeasure of their Patron at home  In the mean Time the King of  France  sent Queen  Elizabeth  a Message assuring her that the Tempest which had been gathering in  Spain  for three Years would certainly break very speedily upon her Kingdom therefore advised her to make the best Preparation she could for its Defence Nor did the King of  Spain  keep it now any longer a Secret having this Year published at  Lisbon  an ample and ostentatious Account of this  Invincible Armada  as the  Spaniards  themselves had called it wherein it appears the whole Fleet consisted of or according to Sir  Walter Ralegh  and  Hugo Grotius  Sail some few Tenders or others joining them by the Way not being perhaps in the  Spanish  List reckoned Carrying by the Generality of Accounts above Pieces of Brass and Iron Ordnance near Soldiers between and Sailors besides Officers Priests Galleyslaves  Servants and other Attendants amounting in all to about Persons or according to the Confession of  Don Diego Piementelli  one of their own Commanders who was driven into  Zealand  the whole Fleet Army c were no less than Men and cost the King of  Spain  Ducats every Day The General of this mighty Navy was the Duke of  Medina Sidonia  Knight of the golden Fleece and  John Martines de Ricalde  was chief Admiral In  Flanders  the Prince of  Parma  was also making great Preparations to join this  Armada  had gathered up an Army consisting of more than some say Companies of Foot and Horse and was very busy in making Rafts Ferryboats floating Bridges Portcullices Gabions and what not Nor were they idle in  England  for how well the Directions of the Council of War aforesaid were put in Execution and how far  Ralegh  may be presumed to have been engaged among the most indefatigable in this Service is to be inferr'd from the Words of that Author who says  In a very short Time the whole Kingdom and every Corner were speedily furnished with armed People on Horseback and on Foot and those continually trained exercised and put into Bands in such warlike Manner as in no Age ever was before in this Realm  And a little further  That all concurred in one Mind to be in Readiness to serve for the Realm and some one Country was able to make a sufficient Army of    Men fit to fight and    of them well armed and weaponed And in some Countries the Number of    able Men That the maritime Countries from  Cornwal  all along southward to  Kent  and from thence Eastward to  Lincolnshire  were so furnished with Soldiers both of themselves and with Resort from their next Shires as there was no Place to be doubted for landing of any  foreign Forces but there were within    Hours to come to the Place above    fighting Men on Horseback and on Foot with all Manner of Ammunition Provision and Carriages under the principal Nobles of the Countries and Captains of the greatest Knowledge  Besides these Armies for the maritime Countries the City of  London  exercised before the Queen Men and had several Thousands more in Readiness that there was also two great Armies raised whereof one were encamped at  Tilbury  in  Essex  between the City and the Mouth of the  Thames  consisting of Foot and Horse under the Command of the Earl of  Leicester  The Queen review'd this Camp several Times din'd made Orations in it and lodged in the Borders of it The other Army consisting of Foot and Horse commanded by the Lord  Hunsdon  was planted about the Queen's own Person  But six Years before this Occasion of raising the military Strength of  England  according to Sir  Walter Ralegh  there were upon a general View and Master found in the Kingdom of all Men fit to bear Arms See his  Select Essays and Observations  vo in his Discourse of the Invention of Shipping p  And it encreas'd daily by the several Bands and Troops which were led from the inland Countries by such Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen as had no special Charge or Government in their respective Counties while the young Earl of  Essex  and others among them entertain'd her Majesty with Tiltings and Tourneys Barriers Mockfights and suchlike Arts as in publick are wont to render Men popular  The Earl of  Essex  was now Master of the Queen's Horse See the Letter to  Mendoza  aforesaid p  In which Sir  Henry Wotton  agrees who makes this father Observation  "This Service at  Tilbury  Camp was in my Judgment says he the very Poison of all that followed for there while the Queen stood in some doubt of the  Spanish  Invasion she made him in Field Commander of the Cavalry as he was before in Court and much graced him openly in View of the Soldiers and People even above my Lord of  Leicester  The Truth is from thenceforth  he fed too fast  "  Parallel bebetween  Robert Devereux  Earl of  Essex  and  George Villiers  Duke of  Buckingham  But the Lieutenants of  the maritime Counties were otherwise employ'd And as the Earl of  Pembroke  had been assiduous in levying the Forces of  Wilts  and  Somersetshire  and the Earl of  Bath  those of  Devonshire  so  Ralegh  seems to have been no less forward and industrious in raising and reducing those of  Cornwal  to the best Order and Discipline for the Service of his Country against the common Enemy notwithstanding what he might have done as has been said before at  Portland  And like the rest of the LordsLieutenant to have sent up constantly his Certificates to the Queen of the Numbers that were assembled the Posture they were in the Provisions they were supply'd with or those whereof they stood in need  But notwithstanding all these LandPreparations which moved some speculative Warriors at Court to think a Seaforce unnecessary as if the  English  were sufficient to cut the  Spaniards  to Pieces in landing or when they were ashore and run away with their Ships at the same Time Sir  Walter Ralegh  knew better what another Kingdom might do even against  England  by the Advantage of a Fleet if we have none no Man having so solidly resolv'd as himself that weighty Question whether  England without the Help of a Fleet is able to debar an Enemy from landing  He knew that Ships without putting themselves out of Breath will easily outrun the Soldiers that coast them He  knew that a Fleet after Sunset may be seen at the  Lizard  and by the next Morning at  Portland  which an Army should be six Days in marching and consequently that the Sailor may chuse his Landingplace where there are no Soldiers that can oppose him And even supposing an Invader should offer to land near where our greatest Army was ready to receive him  Ralegh  doubted when the Choice of all our Train'dBands and of Officers were drawn together as at  Tilbury  to attend the Person of the Queen and to defend the City of  London  whether those that should remain to guard the Coast could be of any such Force as to encounter an Army like that which the Prince of  Parma  should have landed in  England  By Sea therefore all possible Defence was likewife made and the chief Command was very properly conferr'd on the Lordadmiral  Howard▪  who hearing the  Invincible Armada  was upon the Point of hoisting Sail sent Sir  Francis Drake  his Viceadmiral with fiftysix Ships well appointed to the Westernparts and himself arrived there on the d of  May  with others which made up the Fleet about a hundred Sail while the Lord  Henry Seymer  was sent to lie with forty  English  and  Dutch  Snips according to  Camden  between  Dover  and  Calais  to intercept the Prince of  Parma  Michael Ca  ielnau  who was Ambassador here many Years and who has given the most noble and ingenuous Character of the Queen in his  Memoirs  of any Foreigner I have met with that knew her▪ observes that she built a noble Fleet the Bulwark of ner Kingdom and launch'd a large Man of War every second Year But by that long List of the  English  Navy which this Year opposed the  Spanish  Armada among the MSS in the  Royal Library  B XIII lately printed by Mr  Lediard  in his  Naval Expeditions  Fol it appears there were very few Ships of that Burden among them For tho' that List raises their Number beyond all other Accounts to Sail manifestly omitting some which were there and probably admitting several which were not yet there are not above six Ships among them mentioned to be of Ton and not above seven of greater Burden  The  Invincible Armada  loosed Anchor from  Lisbon  four Days before but met with such Storms Sickness and other Disasters that the Lordadmiral put forth towards  Spain  in Hopes of surprising them in their Distress till more maturely considering they might pass by undiscover'd he return'd to  Plymouth  and suffer'd his Men to relieve themselves on Shore The Queen had received such Assurance they were so disabled from coming this Year by that Storm that she made Secretary  Walsingham  send for four of her firstrate Ships to be brought home to  Chatham  But their Return was prevented by the Intelligence which Captain  Thomas Fleming  brought into the Harbour on the th of  July  that he had discovered the Enemy approaching from the  LizardPoint  in  Cornwal  The Captains and Commanders were then it seems at Bowls upon the  Hoe  at  Plymouth  and the Tradition goes that  Drake  would needs see the Game up but was soon prevailed on to go and play out the Rubbers with the  Spaniards  All Hands were now at Work to warp out the Ships which with the admirable Industry of the Seamen was very speedily perform'd the Wind blowing stiffly into the Haven from the Southwest The Lordadmiral with the few he could then get ready lay all Night in the Road Next Day about fifty or threescore more join'd him and at Noon they ken'd the  Spanish  Fleet some with lofty Turrets and Decks rear'd one above another and others rowed along with two or three hundred Oars apiece all advancing with their  Spanish  Gravity the  Wind being abated in a semicircular Order and extended seven Miles from End to End The  English  suffered them all to pass by so got the Advantage of the Wind when they began to chase them in the Rear nor did the  Spaniards  offer to land at  Plymouth  their Commission being to join the Prince of  Parma  and sail directly to  London  The next Day which was the st of  July  the Lordadmiral sent out a Pinnace call'd the  Defiance  and begun the Fight This I take it was near the  Eddistone  for there we have Account of the first Conflict and of the first  Spanish  Ship that was taken or sunk Then the Lordadmiral in the  ArkRoyal Drake  in the  Revenge  with  Hawkins Frobisher  and others having thunder'd thick upon the Enemy for two Hours together withdrew of their Ships not being yet come up In this Engagement the  Spaniards  by endeavouring to circle in and shelter one of their disabled Galleons she had her Foremast broken and was left behind which  Drake  took the next Day with  Don Pedro de Valdez  and other Nobles in her besides Ducats which were shared among his Sailors Immediately after another of their greatest Ships was set on Fire with all the People in her and yet the Powder escaped But how the LordAdmiral all the first Night followed the  Spanish  Lanthern instead of  Drake  's into their Fleet while  Drake  at the same Time was making another mistaken Pursuit and how the  Ark Royal  followed the  Spanish  Fleet also the second Night so far almost alone that it was the Afternoon following before the  English  Fleet overtook her with other Particulars I leave to the more ample Accounts of this Engagement that I may attend the Motions of Sir  Walter Ralegh  who from being at first the nearest now growing impatient at being the most remote from  the Enemy appears to have committed his Charge by Land to proper Officers or detached Part thereof to march up nearer the  Spaniards  and with a gallant Company of Nobles and Gentlemen in several Ships to have join'd the  English  Fleet that is to say on the d of  July  when the  Spanish  Fleet was advanced over against  Portland  where this whole Day being one continued Engagement from Morning till Night it proved the most general and bloody Fight of any between them in the  British  Channel and here after the taking of a great  Venetian  Ship and others of lesser Bulk the  Spaniards  were driven from all Intention of assaulting the  English  till they had joined the Prince of  Parma  for during this Fight  the  English  Navy increas'd whereunto out of all Havens of the Realm resorted Ships and Men for they all with one Accord came flocking thither to  Portland  as unto a set Field where immortal Fame and Glory was to be attained and faithful Service to be performed unto their Prince and Country  In which Number having mentioned the Earls of  Oxford Northumberland  and  Cumberland  he also names Sir  Walter Ralegh  among the foremost of near other Knights and Gentlemen whereby the  English  Ships were augmented to Sail and doubtless by some of those  Camden  mention'd to have been left behind in  PlymouthSound  with which  Ralegh  very probably advanced  What further persuades me to believe  Ralegh  entered the Fleet at this Place and Time is my having met with a certain foreign History hereafter mentioned which had been his own Book and wherein he has with his own Hand corrected other Passages relating to himself but has let this of his joining the Fleet as above pass uncontradicted  These ever asunder and always in Motion were on every side useful to annoy the Enemy now presenting a broadside and sheering  off then tacking about and discharging the other in such fort that Sir  Henry Wotton  call'd it a  Morricedance  upon the  His Parallel between  Robert  Earl of  Essex  and  George  Duke of  Buckingham  beforementioned▪  Waters while the sluggish and unweildy Castles of the Enemy cluster'd and hamper'd together could only offer Offence from one disabled side and that when they had done flew over the  English  Men's Heads  Camden  tells us that in this Day's Engagement the Lordadmiral was advised by some of his Officers with more Heat than Discretion to grapple with and board the Enemy Now  Ralegh  having made some excellent Animadversions upon this very Circumstance goes nigh to prove out of his own Words that he was not only in this Day's Engagement but that the Counsel he might thence appear to have given did greatly contribute to the Success of it He has shewn how well he knew that in such Case the advantage of Weapons would be likeliest to carry it whereof the Enemy was provided with far the greatest Number also that in such close Fight how liable the lesser Ships were to be crush'd by the greater that these by their very Height must have further Advantage over those that endeavour'd to board them from below and lastly in these of more bulk and breadth being also more firm and more steady those who could best keep their Feet would probably be best able to use their Hands  Next Day the  Spaniards  were glad to lie by and the  English  no less pleased with the Cessation that they might take the Opportunity of sending to Shore for a Recruit of Ammunition and this being a Circumstance taken Notice of also by  Ralegh  himself further confirms his having been now  among them The th of  July  the  English  had another sharp Battel with the  Spanish  Admiral and the three great Galleasses at the Isle of  Wight  in which  Cambden  mentions the taking of a  Portuguese  Galleon and that from this Time the Galleasses durst not venture upon any new Engagement but closing themselves up again in a Rundel as they called it made the best of their Way to tell the Prince of  Parma  how they had been served The  English  Fleet followed and kept playing upon their Rear all the next Day having determined to forbear any closer Engagement 'till they came to the  British Frith  or Streights of  Calais  where the Lord  Seymer  expected their Arrival  But so far was this  Invincible Armada  from alarming the Seacoasts says  Camden  that the  English  Gentry of the younger Sort entered themselves Volunteers and leaving their Friends and Families did with incredible Cheerfulness hire Ships at their own Charge and in pure Love to their Country joined the grand Fleet in vast Numbers  And here  Camden  names those Nobles and some of those Gentlemen with  Ralegh  among them which composed the Squadron beforemention'd as if it entered but now from  Dover  or some of those Ports not that he confines their Entrance to this Day otherwise than naming them under it or any other Way suggests they did not join the grand Fleet three Days before but seems by remembering them in this Place to have believed they were most conspicuous or in greatest Number at this Time unless he postponed the Mention of them to a Day that was least throng'd with Circumstances of Action Indeed that this noble Squadron of Volunteers was united to the Queen's Navy when such valiant Services were performed against the  Spaniards  in the great Fight before  Calais  another Writer also greatly to their Commendation  agrees but neither is he so expressive as to satisfy us it was the first Appearance they made and that they were not before at  Portland  For having mentioned the Earls of  Cumberland Northumberland  and other Gentlemen of Distinction who without any Charge or Knowledge of the Queen joined the Fleet before  Calais  and ventured their Lives in the said Engagement he goes on to observe how earnest all Ranks and Degrees were by instancing also  that the Earl of  Oxford  one of the most ancient Nobles in this Land went to Sea and served the Queen among them as did  Robert Cecil  Lord  Dudley  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  a Gentleman of the Queen's Privy Chamber says he and in his Company a great Number of young Gentlemen among whom were  William Cecil Edward Darcie  and  Arthur Gorge the same Persons mentioned with others by  Camden  and also in larger Number by the  Dutch  Historian above quoted three Days before  With the Recital of whom I only shew you continues my last Author the Letterwriter how far we have been deceived to think that we should have had a Party here for us when as you behold both by Land and Sea all Sorts of Men were so ready at their own Charges without either Commandment or Entertainment to adventure also their Lives in Defence of the Queen and the Realm  From hence it appears this Squadron must have also been at the final Overthrow of the  Spanish Armada  which on the th of  July  in the Evening anchored before  Calais  intending to hold on for  Dunkirk  in Expectation of the Prince of  Parma  who was always preparing but never ready and the  English  following anchor'd also within Culvering Shot of them Here the Lord  Seymer  join'd the  English  and then the LordAdmiral's Fleet was increased to a hundred and forty Sail says  Camden  wherein he both exactly agrees with the Augmentation thereof at  Portland  by these Voluntiers as we have it from the  Dutch  Historian there quoted and also excludes all intermediate Addition of Ships at least by the Number himself has before given us of the Lord  Seymer  's Squadron Next Day the  English  resolv'd according to the Queen's Directions upon the Stratagem of the Fireships to burn or disperse the  Spanish  Navy and the same was put in Practice at or soon after Midnight so successfully that the Enemy cutting their Cables with the utmost Horror and Precipitancy were some scatter'd by the Wind some fell foul of each other and others struck upon the Sands the  English  chasing and thundering upon them from all Quarters then was a great Galleass taken by Captain  Preston  its Commander  Moncada  slain and a Booty of near as much Gold fell to the Conquerors as was taken in another beforementioned  'It was affirmed by Men of great Judgment in  Calais  that never was seen by any Man living such a Battery so great for Number so furious and of so long Continuance as the  English  made against the  Spanish Calais  saw the  Spanish  Navy first driven from their Anchors with Fire they saw the greatest Galleass of the  Spanish  whereof was Commander that worthy Nobleman  Moncada  spoiled and himself slain in it by the  English Calais  saw the next Day that the  English  fought and beat the  Armada  from eight o'Clock in the Morning 'till four in the Afternoon without ceasing  Calais  saw the  Spanish  hoist up all their Sails and fly as fast as the Wind could drive and the  English  pursue them Yet  Calais  saw a sufficient Navy of  England  left before  Dunkirk  able to master all the Shipping that the Duke of  Parma  had provided'  Thus in a scarce old Tract in the  Harleyan  Library B H called  A Pack of Spanish Lies  first printed in  Spain  translated and now ripped up unfolded and condemn'd to p  On the th of  July  the  Spaniards  ranged themselves into the best Order they could within Sight of  Graveling  hither the  English  Fleet also pursued them  and here the  Spaniards  received their last fatal Adieu by incessant and numberless Damages from the  English  Cannon the greatest Part of the Day till their  Galleons Galleasses Gallies Urcas  and  Zabras  were so miserably shatter'd having their Hulls pierced through and through their Oars and Rudders cut away their Tackling all rent and their Masts broken that some were deserted as unserviceable some sunk with the Crew that was in them and others retiring upon the neighbouring Coasts were seized and plundered by the Inhabitants While those that had the Ability left them most prudently employ'd it in running away The  English  still followed them into the Northern Seas even beyond the Latitude of Degrees and leaving them past all Thoughts of the Prince of  Parma  return'd on the th of  August  when the violent Storms that arose resumed their Cause and compleated their Victory for by the Tempests Shipwrecks Sickness and Famine in their dangerous Passage homewards they sustained greater Losses than even all they had met with throughout the narrow Seas For the Particulars of those Losses we shall refer to the distinct and more copious Narratives of this Invasion  At the End of an old Pamphlet before quoted called  Certain Advertisements out of  Ireland concerning the Losses and Distresses of the  Spanish  Navy there is one List of fifteen  Spanish  Ships which perished or were taken by the  English  in  July  and  August  in the narrow Seas and another List of more sunk burnt and taken on the Coasts of  Ireland  in  September  so that both Losses were Ships in which were also destroyed and taken Men whereof were detained Prisoners in  England  and  Zealand  further adding there were Multitudes besides slain sunk or starved who were not accounted for Insomuch as  Van Meteran  in  Hakluyt  more distinctly computes with whom I observe most of our Historians agree there returned not Home above Sail leaving also behind the greater and better part of their Men and as they all conclude  There was not a famous or worthy Family in all  Spain  which in this Expedition lost not a Son a Brother or a Kinsman  Among the  English  there were not in the whole eight or nine Days Engagement above lost and among them only one Captain named  Cock  and close this Account  with the Summary thereof which was soon after published to the World by Sir  Walter Ralegh  himself where giving the Honour of the Victory to the Courage and Conduct of the LordAdmiral  Howard  he says that  notwithstanding the Victories they pretended to have obtained it was soon manifested to all Nations how the Navy which they had termed  invincible  consisting of    Sail was by    of the Queen's Ships of War and a few Merchantmen beaten and shuffled together even from the  Li  ard  Point in  Cornwal  to  Portland  where they shamefully left  Don Pedro de Valdez  with his mighty Ship from  Portland  to  Calais  where they lost  Hugo de Moncada  with the Gallies of which he was Captain and from  Calais  driven with  Squibs  from their Anchors were chased out of the Sight of  England  round about  Scotland  and  Ireland  where for the Sympathy of their barbarous Religion hoping to find Succour and Assistance a great Part of them were crush'd against the Rocks and those other who landed being very many in Number were notwithstanding broken slain and taken and so sent from Village to Village coupled in Halters to be shipped into  England  where her Majesty of her princely and  invincible  Disposition disdaining to put them to Death and scorning either to retain or entertain them they were all sent back again to their own Country to witness and recount the worthy Atchievements of their  invincible  Navy  The Services of Sir  Walter Ralegh  against this Invasion his Diligence in regulating the Forces of  the Land and his Interest in strengthning those of the Sea the Charges he was at and the Dangers he voluntarily incurr'd however undistinguish'd more than is above express'd by our common Historians and those few inaccurate Accounts thereof which are descended to us were yet received with such Approbation by the Queen that she seems as some Recompence for them to have this Year made a considerable Augmentation to his Patent of Wines as if he had besides the Grant beforementioned another now also bestowed upon him for Tonnage and Poundage upon those Liquors except it is the same Patent with the former only renewed this Year or wrong dated in the Author who mentions it Be it as it should this Patent seems to have been one of the most beneficial Favours which  Ralegh  ever received of the Queen and might perhaps exceed in Profit the Pension which she settled on the LordAdmiral himself for his Conduct and Courage in the said Overthrow This Benefit  Ralegh  enjoy'd as long as she liv'd though towards the Close of her Reign the Number of suchlike Grants to others being very much encreased they were inveighed against in Parliament as grievous and burdensome Monopolies by those especially who had not the Merit or Interest to procure any for themselves Sir  Robert Naunton  tells us in his Conclusion of  Ralegh  's Character with relation to the Grants he thus obtain'd  That though he gained much at the Court yet he took it not out of the Exchequer or merely out of the Queen's Purse but by his Wit and the Help of the Prerogative for the Queen was never profuse in delivering out her Treasures but paid many and most of her Servants part in Money and the rest with Grace  We meet with another Office which  Ralegh  himself erected no less praiseworthy than  this was profitable to him For one Writer in the short Account he gives of him having spoken of the Division he made of his Time in allowing five Hours to sleep four to Reading two for Discourse and the rest to Business and other Necessaries and having hinted at the Diversity of his Correspondencies Intelligence and the like says that  in the Capacity of an Agency for all Sorts of Persons he set up a kind of  Office of Address And further  that considering the Dispatch of such Variety of Engagements in the former Part of his Life one must be much to seek how a Man of so many Actions should write any Thing and one of so many Writings should do any Thing  By another little Hint that has been elsewhere preserved we may conceive this Office did chiefly respect a more liberal Intercourse a nobler Mutuality of Advertisement than would perhaps admit of all Sorts of Persons and such as advanced rather to the Improvement of Men themselves than their Means But this Suggestion is drawn only from comparing it with the general Tendency of those other Schemes among which I once saw it mentioned in a Letter written by an ingenious Person of great Note for his Writings to a Nobleman who had the greatest Correspondence with such Persons of any in his Time recommending  that long dried Fountain of Communication which  Montaigne  first propos'd Sir  Walter Ralegh  put in Practice and Mr  Hartlib  endeavour'd to revive  The Notice of this most useful Scheme since I have not at present Mr  Hartlib  's own Account I shall here offer in Sir  William Petty  's ingenious Representation of it directed many Years since to the said last Projector himself  'We must recommend says he an  Office of Address  according to the Projection of Mr  Hartlib  that painful and great Instrument of this Design  whereby the Wants and Desires of all may be made known to all  Where Men may know what is  already done  in the Business of  Learning  what is at present  in doing  and what is intended  to be done  to the End that by such a general Communication of Designs and mutual Assistance the Wits and Endeavours of the World may no longer be as so many  scattered  Coals which for want of  Union  are soon  quenched  whereas being but laid  together  they would have yielded a comfortable  Light  and  Heat  For methinks the present Condition of Men is like a Field where a Battle having been lately fought we see many Legs Arms and Organs of Sense lying here and there which for want of Conjunction and a Soul to quicken and enliven them are fit for nothing but to feed the Ravens and infect the Air So we see many Wits and Ingenuities dispersed up and down the World whereof some are now labouring to  do  what is already  done  and puzzling themselves to  reinvent  what is already  invented  Others we see quite stuck fast in Difficulties for want of a few Directions which some other Man might he be met withal both could and would most easily give him Again one Man wants a small Sum of Money to carry on some Design that requires it and there is perhaps another who has twice as much ready to bestow upon the same Design but these two having no Means ever to hear the one of the other the good Work intended and desired by  both  Parties does utterly perish and come to nothing But this we pass over slightly though very fundamental to our Business because the  MasterBuilder  thereof himself has done it so  solidly  '  Don Antonio  King of  Portugal  who had been expell'd from his Dominions by King  Philip  and was now in  London  soon after the Signal Overthrow of the  Armada  aforesaid took this Opportunity to renew his Motion to Queeen  Elizabeth  for her Assistance towards his Restoration which he propounded to the LordTreasurer in a Letter full of liberal Offers written in the  Portuguese  Language all with his own Hand The Queen not only consented to the Enterprise as thinking it more convenient to return the late Visit of the  Spaniards  in their own Country than suffer them to repeat it here but lent six of her Men of War  and disbursed Pounds towards defraying the Charges thereof This Encouragement and the late Provocation so spirited up the warlike Men of the Kingdom and  Ralegh  among the rest to become Volunteers therein that they augmented the Number of the said Ships with a hundred and twenty Sail more and mann'd them with fourteen or fifteen thousand Soldiers and Sailors at their own further Expence committing the Charge by Sea to Sir  Francis Drake  and that by Land to Sir  John Norris  who were probably the most considerable Contributors thereto  But first  Ralegh  took Care for the Relief of his Plantation in  Virginia  which that he might more effectually secure than could be expected from his own single Assistance especially after the many heavy Disbursments he had made and the great Disappointment the Colony must doubtless have received by missing of the last Supplies he sent them through the Losses which his Agents too rashly brought thereon he made an Assignment to divers Gentlemen and Merchants of  London  for continuing the Plantation of this new discover'd Country with  English  Men And this was now no less advisedly done with regard to himself than affectionately with respect to the People employ'd therein Whom though he generously assisted with his Advice and Interest in some future Prosecutions of this Undertakings yet these proving improsperous through the oblique Courses they took at first setting out upon this new Foundation like that in which they lately fail'd it was twenty Years from this Time before even a whole Company could make a more successful and advanced P ogress in this Settlement than Sir  Walter Ralegh  of himself alone had done it having cost him no less than  l  As for the Expedition before mentioned which was set out under  Drake  and  Norris  about five Weeks after the said Assignment that is on the th of  April  in which  Don Antonio  was by  Ralegh  among the rest accompanied to  Portugal  we need not here be circumstantial thereon especially as to the Action at the  Groine  the Overthrow of the  Spaniard  at  Puente de Burgus  the taking of  Peniche  with the Castle of  Cascais  the Assault of  Lisbon  and the burning of  Vigo  seeing our Historians have not distinguished what Part  Ralegh  had therein In which perhaps they seem not so grateful to him as he was to his Associates but particularly in not mentioning him at the taking of that great Number of easterling Hulks and other Ships laden with  Spanish  Goods Provisions and Ammunition for a new Invasion of  England  which from the d of  June  some or other of the Adventurers none are named continued to bring into the  English  Fleet then lying in the Road of  Cascais  for six Days together This Fleet of ours was but thinly mann'd at first and having lost some thousands by Sickness and Intemperance with the new Wines of those Countries Hands could not be spared to bring home much above a quarter of those Vessels and their Lading that were thus taken For Sir  Roger Williams  who was a Colonel in the LandService of this Expedition has said in a Letter of his still extant  It is well known we had above two hundred Sail of all Sorts of which we could not carry with us above threescore for the Want of Men  Hence arose at their Return into  England  a little Contention between  Williams  and  Ralegh  for  Ralegh  having taken some of these Prizes  Williams  placed in one of them his Lieutenant with some of his Soldiers  without which  says  Williams it could not have been carried into  England  Wherefore he would have laid Claim it seems both to the Ship and its Cargo  this Voyage as he goes on having cost him a Thousand Pounds  as it did several other of the Adventurers no doubt But his Claim not being thought reasonable the Earl of  Bath  Lieutenant of  Devonshire  discharged his Men from that Vessel at  Dartmouth Williams  at this growing very turbulent and his Clamours reaching the Queen's Ear procured her Displeasure against him which occasion'd his said Letter to three of the PrivyCouncil whence this Intelligence is extracted From this Letter we farther collect the Atchievements of the  English  in this Voyage so well satisfy'd the Queen in the Disablement of the Enemy especially as to their naval Powers that she honoured the Commanders or chief Adventurers therein and Sir  Walter Ralegh  among the rest with a golden Chain for Sir  Roger  presum'd the Earl of  Essex  his great Friend as appears in the Histories of this Expedition with the rest who were in the Action would testify  That I deserve a Chain as well as my Fellows  say he As for the coarse Expression which follows of  Ralegh's belying his Hulk as he had done the Ark of  Noah  the best Ship that ever was  tho' it may betray some Impoliteness of Manners and Impetuosity of Disposition in Sir  Roger  's Civil Capacity yet in the Field and against an Enemy those rougher Qualities might invigorate his Courage and Experience and illustrate the miliary Character of the Man  In the latter End of  June  this Year and some Weeks before this Dispute the  English  Fleet return'd home but  Ralegh  appears first to have touch'd upon the Coast of  Ireland  probably to make a short Visit to his Seigniory there and see some of his Acquaintance among the new Settlements  in the Province of  Munster  We may be pretty well convinc'd that  Ralegh  was in  Ireland  this Year from his own Writings  Where speaking of the long Lives of the Patriarchs and some of late Memory he says  "I myself knew the old Countess of  Desmond  of  Inchequin  in  Munster  who lived in the Year and many Years since who was married in  Edward  the Fourth's Time and held her Jointure from all the Earls of  Desmond  since then and that this is true all the Nobility and Gentlemen of  Munster  could witness"  History of the World  Lib I Cap Sect Of this old Lady see more in Lord  Bacon's History of Life and Death  and Sir  William Temple  's  Essay on Health and long Life  in his Miscellanies Part publish'd by  Jonathan Swift  M A Prebendary of St  Patrick  's vo p where telling us she lived  far in King  James  's Reign  it appears she must have been alive at the Time Sir  Walter Ralegh  was writing that he knew her in  Ireland  the Year aforesaid  and that it was upon his Return from a long Voyage out of some Verses hereafter following in  Spenser  the Poet For here we may observe that while  Ralegh  was a Commander in the  Irish  Wars under the Lord  Grey  as we have before related this  Edmund Spenser  then famous for those  Pastorals  he had newly published going over Secretary to that Nobleman had frequent Opportunities by his ingenious Conversation so to make his Learning and other Accomplishments known as engag'd the Friendship of our WORTHY so substantially towards him that none of the great Men in Queen  Elizabeth  's Court after the Death of Sir  Philip Sidney  was so great a Patron to that extraordinary Genius as Sir  Walter Ralegh  Indeed the Queen herself in Regard that  Spenser  employ'd his Time so commendably in  Ireland  as afterwards more publickly appear'd in the excellent  Political View  he made of that Kingdom gave him a considerable Tract of Land out of Earl  Desmond  's capacious Forfeitures amounting at the lowest Computation that has been made to  Acres of Ground lying in the County of  Cork  the Preservation and Improvement whereof engaged  Spenser  to settle there and a pleasant Seat he had at  Kilcolman  near the River  Mulla  which ran through his Grounds and which he has so beautifully describ'd in some of his Poems Here it was in this Retirement that  Ralegh  now paid him a Visit the Circumstances whereof  Spenser  himself has most agreeably celebrated in that Poem which about two Years after this Time he dedicated  To the Right Worthy and Noble Knight Sir  Walter Ralegh c In this Dedication he has these Words  I make you Present of this simple  Pastoral  unworthy of your higher Conceipt for the Meanness of the Style but agreeable with the  Truth in Circumstance and Matter  the which I humbly beseech you to accept in Part of Payment of the infinite Debt in which I acknowledge myself bounden unto you for your singular Favours and sundry good Turns shewed me at my last being in  England  and with your good Countenance protect against the Malice of evil Mouths which are always wide open to carp at and misconstrue my simple Meaning  In the Pastoral itself  Entitled  Collin Clout's come home again  in the last Edition of  Spenser  Vol p  the Poet gives us this Description of  Ralegh  's first accosting him in the said rural Retirement  One Day quoth he I sat as was my Trade  Under the Foot of  Mole  that Mountain hore  Keeping my Sheep amongst the cooly Shade  Of the green Alders by the  Mulla  's Shore  There a strange Shepherd chanc'd to find me out  Whether allured with my Pipe's Delight  Whose pleasing Sound yshrilled far about  Or thither led by Chance I knew not right  Whom when I asked from what Place he came  And how he hight himself he did ycleep  The Shepherd of the Ocean  by Name  And said he came  far from the Mainsea  deep  He sitting me beside in that same Shade  Provoked me to play some pleasant Fit  And when he heard the Musick that I made  He found himself full greatly pleas'd at it  Yet aemuling my Pipe he took in Hond  My Pipe before that aemuled of many  And play'd thereon for well that Skill he con'd  Himself as skilful in that Art as any  It further appears they now entertain'd each other with some of their poetical Compositions  Spenser  rehearsed a pretty Tale he had made of the Amours between some of his neighbouring Rivers but  Ralegh  's Muse ran upon a more melancholy Strain which by the transient View it gives of some little Cloud he had lately but undeservedly been under at Court lets us into a Piece of his secret History where the Poet tells us  His Song was all a lamentable Lay  Of great Unkindness and of Usage hard  Of  Cynthia  the Lady of the Sea  Which from her Presence faultless him debarr'd  And ever and anon with  Singults  rife  He cried out to make his undersong  Ah my Love's Queen and Goddess of my Life  Who shall me pity when thou dost me Wrong  But it immediately appears to have been soon blown over by some pathetical Address of  Ralegh  's to the Queen whereby he was at this Time restored  to her Favour as we may fully conclude from these Words  Right well be sure did' plain  That could great  Cynthia's  sore Displeasure break  And move to take him to her Grace again  And this is confirmed a little further where through  Ralegh  's Affection for his Welfare and his Regret to behold so rare a Genius banished to a Desart and buried in such a State of Obscurity he persuades  Spenser  to go along with him into  England  and proffers to introduce him to the Queen The Poet knowing his Interest embraced his Offer Then having given a Description of the Sea with  Ralegh  's great Ship suitable to the Simplicity of the Character he assumes and having represented  Ralegh  's Description of the Flocks and Herds of that  Royal Shepherdess  which were kept upon those watry Hills under the Charge of  Triton  and  Proteus  he makes him further say  And I among the rest of many least  Have in the Ocean Charge to me assign'd  Where I will live or die at her Beheast  And serve and honour her with faithful Mind  He then proceeds to the Progress of their Voyage how they passed by the  Isle of Lundy  and landed at St  Michael  's  Mount  in  Cornwall  so took their Journey to the Court where the Poet having expatiated on the dazling Presence of the Queen agreeable to the Admiration of a Spectator in his pastoral Character we have this further Acknowledgment  The Shepherd of the Ocean  quoth he  Unto the Goddess  's  Grace me first enhanced  And to my oaten Pipe inclined her Ear  That she thenceforth therein 'gan take Delight  And it desired at timely Hours to hear  All were my Notes but rude and roughly dight  This Honour the Poet further magnifies as the more wond'rous Condescension in her Majesty in that she had so many more learned Shepherds about her to glorify her Name Here he takes an Opportunity to give a Character of the several Poets and Wits then shining in her Court Among the rest  And there that  Shepherd of the Ocean  is  That spends his Wit in Love's consuming Smart  Full sweetly temper'd is that Muse of his  That can impierce a Prince's mighty Heart  As to  Ralegh  's poetical Talents we shall hear more of them very speedily In this Place we must pursue his farther Design of bringing  Spenser  over into  England  which was to make him oblige the Publick with what he had hitherto finished of his capital Work called the  Fairy Queen  For though  Spencer  had begun this grand Poem through the Encouragement of Sir  Philip Sidney  before he went over into  Ireland  yet it was there he seems to have writ most of what we have in Print and now by the Encouragement of Sir  Walter Ralegh  that he was brought to publish the three first Books which he had compleated thereof 'Tis certain he took his Advice in the Publication of them and particularly in drawing up a Plan to explain or discover the general Intention and Meaning of that allegorical Poem This he directed to his said Patron  The right noble and valorous Sir  Walter Ralegh c in a letter dated the d of  January  this  Year concluding with  An humble Request for the Continuance of his honourable Favours and Wishes for the eternal Establishment of his Happiness  This Letter is printed at the End of the said first three Books of that Poem which were published at  London  the ensuing Year Among the commendatory Verses thereto also subjoined the first two Copies are both said to be written by Sir  Walter Raleigh  and not without great Probability being subscribed with the initial Letters of his Name The first of these Copies written in alternate Verse is highly poetical for our Author Correspondent with the visionary Manner of his Author fancying himself in the Temple of the vestal Virgins where his Curiosity led him to the Tomb of  Laura  which was guarded by  Love  and  Virtue  he was suddenly attracted from thence by the Appearance of the  Fairy Queen  at whose Approach the  Soul of Petrarch wept  seeing those Graces desert that Mistress of his to attend upon this royal Lady and Oblivion supply their Place The Compliment is surely fine and perhaps the more judiciously express'd in not being bounded more periodically than it is according to the Doctrine of our modern Criticks in the Structure of Versification for being the Recital of one solemn and surprising Thought it may engage our Attention more closely to the End of the two or three Quadrains it is compris'd in than if the Author had affected to divide or bound the Sense with a full Period at the End of every four Lines But every Reader may easily judge for himself the Poem being in most Editions of  Spenser  and therefore needs not here be recited His other Verses upon this Poet are composed in a Measure more obsolete to the Manner of our Age but what the Queen her self imitated in some Poetry still to be seen of her  Writing being in Lines of six and seven Feet long It may be sufficient therefore to observe there is a distinguished Conduct also in this Performance for the Induction is writ with great Modesty in Regard to himself  The Praise of meaner Wits this Work like Profit brings  As doth the Cuckow's Song delight when  Philomela  sings  And having advertised the Poet that his Portraits are to be judged of or improved by the Originals of those Virtues whereof he has compos'd his fictitious Queen he very dexterously transfers or appropriates them to the real one then reigning So concludes with a Compliment to him which though of a very transcendent and absolute Nature yet in Regard to the little good  English  Poetry then in being and the great Fame of that Poet still surviving among us is still thought not more expressive of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Affection than his Judgment  Of me no Lines are lov'd nor Letters are of Price  Of all that speak the  English  Tongue but those of thy Device  We further observe among the Copies of Verses inscribed by  Spenser  himself at the End of his said  Fairy Queen  to the several Ministers of State and Noblemen in Queen  Elizabeth  's Court one to the  Noble and valorous Sir  Walter Ralegh c as he again stiles him And this because it not only informs us what a favourite  Ralegh  was at this Time with the Queen but also gives us Occasion to dilate upon his own poetical Productions a little  more copiously than Opportunity has before offered  To thee that are the Summer's Nightingale  Thy sovereign Goddesses most dear delight  Why do I send this rustick Madrigal  That may thy tuneful Ear unseason quite  Thou only fit this Argument to write  In whose high Thoughts Pleasure hath built her Bowre  And dainty Love learned sweetly to indite  My Rhymes I know unsav'ry are and sowre  To taste the Streams which like a golden Showre  Flow from thy fruitful Head of thy Love's Praise  Fitter perhaps to thunder martial Stowre  When so thee list thy lofty Muse to raise  Yet 'till that thou  thy Poem  wilt make known  Let thy fair  CYNTHIA  's Praises be thus rudely shown  Hence we learn Sir  Walter Ralegh  wrote a Poem call'd CYNTHIA that it was in Praise of the Queen and that it was not now publish'd  Spenser  in his Letter to  Ralegh  abovecited also mentions again something of this Poem where he says  In that  Fairy Queen  I mean  Glory  in my general Intention but in my Particular I conceive the most excellent and glorious Person of our Sovereign the  Queen  and her Kingdom in  Fairyland  And yet in some Places else I do otherwise shadow her For considering she beareth two Persons the one of a most Royal Queen or Empress the other of a most virtuous and beautiful Lady this latter Part in some Places I do express in  Belphoebe  fashioning her Name according to your own excellent Conceit of  CYNTHIA Phoebe  and  Cynthia  being both Names of  Diana This is all I remember to have met with of that Poem  But this very Year that  Ralegh  was in  Ireland  there was a Book published by a learned and ingenious Gentleman in which others of  Ralegh  's Poems and perhaps that beforementioned are quoted with great Commendation  This Treatise now very scarce is called  The Art of  English  Poesy contrived in three Books  The first of Poets and Poesy the second of Proportion the third of Ornament  London  to I never saw but one of them and this is in the curious Library of that worthy Owner  James West  Esq of the  MiddleTemple  There is a wooden Print of the Queen before it and though dedicated to the Lord  Burghley  the Work is address'd directly to the Queen Therefore that Passage in the first Book  cap  where the Author is so luxuriant upon the  Epithalamies  or poetical Manner of celebrating Marriages and that in the third Book  cap  where he makes the  Imperial  Ambassador a  Bohemian  born so bluntly express in the  French  Tongue what a gallant Horsewoman the Empress was will among some others be allowed very remarkable in a Book so publickly and so particularly tendered to the Perusal of our VirginQueen  as if these few little Pieces had before this Time rendered him eminent and advanced his Name among the prime Wits or leading Poets of the Age not that we are sure they were now in common Print or vulgarly known to be his for the said Author speaking of the most considerable Writers in  English  Poetry says  In her Majesty's Time sprung up another Company of courtly Poets who have writ excellently well if their Doings could be found out and made publick with the rest of which Number is  Edward  Earl of  Oxford Thomas  Lord  Buckhurst  when young  Henry  Lord  Paget  Sir  Philip Sidney  Sir  Walter Ralegh  and many others some of whom he further names  Then proceeding to give his Judgment in short Characters of them and having distinguish'd the Earl of  Oxford  for  Comedy Buckhurst  for  Tragedy  Sir  Philip Sidney  and the other Gentleman who wrote the late  Shepherd's Calender  meaning  Spenser  for  Eclogue  and  Pastoral  he adds  For  Ditty  and amorous  Ode  I find Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Vein most  lofty insolent  and  passionate But it is in the Chapter of  Sententious  or  Rhetorical Figures  that this Critic illustrates his Observation by some Examples out of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Poems which because rare to be met with I shall here rehearse That Critic therefore where he is speaking of some elegant Tautologies in Poetry and particularly the Excellencies of the  Anaphora  or Figure of  Report  as he translates it gives us the following Example written by Sir  Walter Ralegh  whether in his  Cynthia  I cannot yet tell but  to his greatest Mistress in most excellent Verses  says that Author  In vain my Eyes in vain you waste your Tears  In vain my Sighs the Smokes of my Despairs  In vain you search the Earth and Heav'ns above  In vain you seek for Fortune keeps my Love  Further speaking of the  Epizeuxis  which he englishes the  Underlay  or  CuckowSpell  another Sort of Repetition when in one Verse we iterate one Word without Intermission he brings as an Example that of Sir  Walter Ralegh very sweet  says he  With Wisdom's Eyes had but blind Fortune seen  Then had my Love my Love for ever been  And in another Place to distinguish that Form of Repetition called  Ploche  or the  Doubler  a speedy Iteration of one Word but with some little Intermission he exemplies the two  closing Verses of a most excellent Ditty  as he calls it written by Sir  Walter Ralegh  These two closing Verses confirm the Genuineness of those which precede them in a Transcript of this very Ditty I once saw in a Nobleman's Library from the Copy of a celebrated Lady  Lady  Isabella Thynne  the same who is so finely celebrated by Mr  Waller  tho' her Sirname is no where to be found in any of the printed Editions I have seen of his Poems but I have had an old MS Collection in which one Poem is directed to the Lady  Isabella Thynne cutting Trees in  Paper which Poem is printed among Mr  Waller  's but her Name left out In the Print also we have only a Fragment but my Copy had it entire For the Poem which follows it in Mr  Waller  's printed Collection is a Compliment to the same Lady for restoring him this Piece because he desired to print it though the last Thought was torn off and lost which to his Regret he never could recollect so was obliged to print it imperfectly in his own Apprehensions at least though all the World besides have looked upon what is printed of it as a perfect Masterpiece even of that great Hand And for our Consolation it may be observed if he had not lost this Conclusion we should have lost that fine Poem which was the Consequence of it  who probably had it out of the Family 'Tis there entitled  The Excuse written by Sir  Walter Ralegh  in his younger Years  And because by the foregoing Parts of this  admir'd Ditty  the Conclusion will be best understood I shall here repeat the whole from the aforesaid Transcript  Calling to mind my  Eyes  went long about  To cause my Heart for to forsake my Breast  All in a Rage I sought to pull them out  As who had been such Traitors to my Rest  What could they say to win again my Gra ce  Forsooth that they had seen my Mistress' Face  Another Time my  Heart  I call'd to mind  Thinking that he this Woe on me had brought  Because that he to Love his Force resign'd  When of such Wars my Fancy never thought  What cou'd he say when I wou'd him have slain  That he was hersand had forgone my Chain  At last when I perceiv'd both  Eyes  and  Heart  Excuse themselves as guiltless of my Ill  I found myself the Cause of all my Smart  And told myself that I myself would kill  Yet when I saw myself to you was true  I lov'd myself because my self lov'd you  There is one old Collection I never saw printed about the Time we are now upon with several of Sir  Philip Sidney  's Sonnets in it and therefore I think under his Name which possibly may contain some also of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's But in that modern Collection there is also printed not over correctly it seems another Poem of his This I have likewise seen in Manuscript where it is call'd the  Silent Lover  and have heard several Lines in it applauded especially the Beginning But the Part which would be most agreeable in this Place to an Historical Reader is that from which he might fancy he could make some further Guesses at the Object of  Ralegh  's Address  But seeing that I sue to serve  A Saint of such Perfection  As all desire and none deserve  A Place in her Affection  I rather chuse to want Relief  Than venture the revealing  Where Glory recommends the Grief  Despair disdains the healing  And a little farther very persuasively  Silence in Love betrays more woe  Than Words tho' never so witty  A  Beggar  that is  dumb  you know  May challenge  double  Pity  In short he has said such handsome Things of Silence that it were a Pity any Words even in its Commendation but his own should break it But it will perhaps hereafter be thought he could break it himself with as much Success as now he seems to have commanded the keeping it All that I have seen more of his Juvenile Compositions in this Kind is a Pastoral Sonnet which old Mr  Isaac Walton  reciting tells us was written by Sir  Walter Ralegh  in his younger Years  See  Isaac Walton  's  Compleat Angler  th Edition vo p c This  Walton  was Years of Age at  Ralegh  's Death and lived Years Besides that Book for which he has been called the  Father of Anglers  he wrote five Lives of learned and religious Men excellently well being either from a personal Knowledge of them or their intimate Friends  in Answer to another famous also in those Days composed by  Christopher Marlow  There is another Poet besides  Spenser  who writ something of  Ralegh  relating to these Times tho' near twenty Years after them and as on a different Subject so with a different Disposition towards him This Poet was Sir  John Harrington  the Translator of  Orlando Furioso  but that which he is here mention'd for is a little Book in Prose yet not clear of Poetry tho' it was intended for a Piece of ChurchHistory and as a Supply to Dr  Francis Godwin  's  Catalogue of Bishops  This at the Time that  Ralegh  was under Royal Displeasure in the next Reign and in Confinement but growing into Favour with the hopeful Prince of  Wales  Sir  John Harrington  then a Courtier presented to that  Prince 'tis full of little Jests and Tales against the married Clergy and against some of the Laity who had any Controversies with them the better to insinuate with that young Prince and engage his Attention otherwise the Author would doubtless have written it with a Gravity suitable to the Subject but he tells the Prince  he took some kind of Pleasure with the Pains of writing it supposing says he I was all the while telling a Story as it were in your Highness Presence and hearing  Among the Stories he tells there is one concerning Dr  Thomas Godwin  Bishop of  Bath  and  Wells  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  it seems the Relation of which because that Bishop died about the latter End of we shall not longer defer This Bishop he tells us came to that See among his other good Qualities unreprovable for Simony and in the Queen's good Opinion If he had held on as clear as he enter'd I should have highly extoll'd him says our Author but continues he see his Misfortune which first lost him the Queen's Favour and after forced him to another Mischief For being aged diseased and lame of the Gout he married as some thought for Opinion of Wealth a  London  Widow his second Wife at least When a chief Favourite of that Time whom he had named before in this Kind and therefore thought by some as perhaps it might be Sir  Walter Ralegh  had labour'd to get the Manor of  Banwell  from this Bishoprick but disdaining the Repulse and hearing of this intempestive Marriage he took Advantage thereof caus'd it to be told the Queen knowing how much she misliked such Matches and instantly pursued the Bishop with Letters and Mandates for the Manor of  Banwell  for a hundred Years The good Bishop to pacify his Persecutors and to save  Banwell  was fain to part with  Wilscomb  for Years  and so purchased his Peace And as he did not hold on so clear as he enter'd it might be with Reference to the Simony beforementioned the Queen saw it not unreasonable but espoused the Alienation so that it was her Gift And the Bishop's own Son Dr  Francis Godwin  when he was Bishop also and reviving his  Catalogue of Bishops  in the next Reign before  Ralegh  was out of Prison makes no Complaint against him in the Account of his Father's Life tho' he might safely if he could justly have done it and  Ralegh  had been possess'd of that for which this Author's Father had not according to the Custom of those Times received Satisfaction On the contrary with much Modesty rather laments that his Father should take upon him the Duties of Ecclesiastical Government when his Infirmities had render'd him unable to discharge them  If this Affair did any ways displease the Hierarchy there was another Occurrence fell out about this Time in which  Ralegh  by shewing a generous and charitable Instance of his Power and Interest might give some further Umbrage for its Displeasure It was in the Case of Mr  John Udall  Minister of the Gospel a good Scholar and a Man of good Parts but very zealous for the Reformation even under the episcopal Government for which he was reckoned among the Nonconformists or rather Puritans of those Times He had been bred at  Cambridge  was seven Years Minister of  Kingston upon Thames  and through the Favour of the Earl of  Huntington  about a Twelvemonth at  Newcastle upon Tine  Here he was silenced sent for to  London  by Letters from the Lordchamberlain  Hunsdon  in the Name of the Council and examined about a Book he had newly published  against the Clergy  Entitled  The Demonstration of Discipline which Christ hath prescrib'd in his Word for the Government of the Church in all Times and Places until the World's End  The horrible Treason in this Book it seems which was inserted in the Indictment lay in these Words to the Bishops  'Who can without blushing deny you to be the Cause of all Ungodliness seeing your Government is that which giveth Leave to a Man to be any Thing saving a sound Christian For certainly it is more free in these Days to be a  Papist  an  Anahaptist  of the  Family of Love  yea any wicked one whatsoever than that which we should be And I could live these twenty Years any such in  England  yea in a Bishop's House maybe and never be molested for it So true is that which you are charged with in a Dialogue lately come forth against you and since burned by you  That you care for nothing but the Maintenance of your Dignities be it to the Damnation of your own Souls and infinite Millions more  '  Strype's Life and Acts of Archbishop  Whitgift Fol P  But because contrary to the Laws he would not betray himself he was committed close Prisoner to the  Gatehouse  debarred of all Communication with his Family or others thence conveyed to  Croydon  in  July  this present Year brought to the Bar in Fetters and indicted for publishing a Libel against the Queen No Evidence  Viva Voce  produced to attest it but only Depositions taken in the high CommissionCourt no Court of Record and Hearsay Reports urged against him his Witnesses not being permitted to testify in his Behalf because the Court said it was against the Queen The Words of the Statute being wrested says my Author by Baron  Clark  and Serjeant  Puckering  as if the Treatise called  The Demonstration of Discipline  for which  Udall  was now indicted because written against Bishops who exercised their Government under the Queen was therefore consequently written against her royal Person So the said Judges directed the Jury to find  Udall  Author of the Book  without legal Proof and to leave the Felony to them  The Jury did as they were taught being told it should be no further Danger to the Author but tend to his good of which Verdict they afterwards repented Then he was kept half a Year uncondemned in Durance and at the Assizes in  February  following at  Southwark  not relinquishing his Tenets he had the Sentence of Death pronounced against him by  Puckering  But it seems before  Udall  received this Sentence he had procured a Friend to sollicit Sir  Walter Ralegh  that the violent and aggravated Constructions which had been made of his Doctrine and Principles might not be his utter Destruction 'till a more unprejudiced Judgment was made of them and immediately after the Sentence was pronounced the Sheriff brought him a Reprieve from the Queen Then Dr  Bond  one of her Chaplains came to him in Prison with a Form of Submission for him to subscribe After two Days Conference they agreed upon another But says  Udall at the same Time that Dr  Bond  was with me I received a Letter from a Friend of mine that did sollicit Sir  Walter Ralegh  for me  This Letter he then exhibits and thereby it appears  Ralegh  had advised or encouraged  Udall  to explain himself to him concerning those Imputations which had been infused into her Majesty which accused him with maintaining the Church of  England  and its Sacraments were no Church and no Sacraments that its Laws and her Government were against the Word of God that all ecclesiastical Matters ought to be governed by a Presbytery and that she ought to be subject to the Censures thereof for says that Correspondent  If ye will write half a Dozen Lines to Sir  Walter Ralegh  concerning these Opinions that he may shew it  to her Majesty he hopes to obtain your Life I know it is very easy for you to answer all those Things therefore do it with speed and in your writing to Sir  Walter  take Knowledge that he hath sent you such Word  Hereupon  Udall  wrote a Letter which he also sets forth directed to the  Right honourable Sir  Walter Ralegh  Knt Lordwarden of the Stannaries  wherein after the Remembrance of his Duty and Thanks for his great and honourable Care over him and for his Good he most humbly beseeches him to be a means to appease her Majesty's Displeasure for the Accusations untruly suggested against him  After this he remained according to his own Expression without great Hope of Liberty yet without Fear of further Extremity Whence it may be rightly observed by some Historians that Sir  Walter Ralegh  through his generous Intercesnon did procure  Udall  's Reprieve or save him from Execution 'Till a few Months after being further pestered with stricter Forms of Submission by Dr  Andrews  he was forced to make further Applications not only by the Earl of  Essex  but Sir  Walter Ralegh  again and Dean  Nowell  against the Menaces of the approaching Assizes at  Kingston  About the same Time the King of  Scots  also wrote a Letter to the Queen in Behalf of the said Mr  Udall  and other learned Nonconformists  Herein his Majesty tells the Queen  'That hearing of the Apprehension of Mr  Udall  Mr  Cartwright  and certain other learned Ministers of the Evangell within your Realm says he of whose good Erudition and fruitful Travels in the Church we hear a very credible Commendation howsoever their Diversity from Bishops and others of your Clergy in Matters touching them in Conscience hath been a mean by their Dilation to work them your Misliking at this present we cannot weighing the Duty we owe to such as are afflicted for their Conscience in that Profession but by our most effectual and earnest Letter interpone us at your Hands to any harder Usage of them for that Cause So requesting her earnestly to let them be released out of their present Straite he concludes from  Edinburgh  the th of  June  '    But this wrought only so far when  Udall  was brought to  Kingston  that he was immediately returned to Prison before the first Day of the Trials and thereupon the unlucky Disturbance of  Hacket  the Enthusiast ensuing  Udall  was discouraged from making further Solicitation 'till the Lordchancellor  Hatton  died The  Easter  after which he sued for Liberty to go to Church which was denied him being a condemned Man But by the Lordtreasurer's Means getting a Copy of the Indictment and a Pardon framed according to it he was referr'd therewith to Archbishop  Whitgift Unto whom says he I both sent divers Petitions and dutiful Letters and also got many of my Friends both honourable Personages and others to sue to him yet could not his Goodwill be gotten  And when the  Turkey  Merchants applied to his Grace that  Udall  might go over to  Guinea  he would not consent to that unless they would be bound he should not return 'till he had her Majesty's License but to this  Udall  would not consent And though Sir  John Puckering  now LordKeeper was at last moved to deal with the Archbishop so that both promised to obtain  Udall  's Pardon of her Majesty and Liberty for the said Voyage yet  Udall  never enjoyed one or the other for he died in Prison before they were fully confirmed  Of whom we have this Tradition That he was the first Man King  James  asked for when he came into  England  and being answered he was dead the King replied  By my Sal then the greatest Scholar in  Europe  's dead    Here we may give another Instance of  Ralegh  's friendly and generous Exercise of his Power and  Interest for an old Officer in the Army since there is no Date to it that confines us to any particular Year This Officer had a Sum of Money long owing him it seems from the Treasury and knowing how well  Ralegh  was acquainted with the Justice of the Debt no less than what Influence his Applications would be of for procuring it prevailed on him to write to the Lord Treasurer's Secretary who was afterwards knighted and well known by the Name of Sir  Michael Hicks  that he might obtain his Lordship's Order for the Payment of the Money These are the Words of his Letter  I am most earnestly to intreat you for this Gentleman Captain  Spring  that partly for Love partly for honest Consideration you will further him with my Lord Treasurer for a Debt of Three hundred Pounds which her Majesty owes him It hath been long due and he has got good Warrant for it besides he has served her Majesty very long and hath received many Wounds in her Service These Reasons delivered by a Man of your Utterance and  having his good Argel at your Elbow  to instruct you I doubt not but it will take good and speedy Effect  Concluding  I never wrote unto you for any Man or in any Matter wherein you shall more bind me unto you than for this Bearer and so not doubting of your assured Friendliness I leave you to God and remain your most assured loving Friend  In a Postscript he says  Always remember you must deal conscionably for my Sake and I will requite you  Examples of this kind shew Men worthy of the Power they enjoy and shine brighter in their Characters than many Actions of a more publick and magnificent Nature Power being so often corrupted with Pride and other Passions as frequently render the Possessors of it mischievous rather than beneficial to their FellowCreatures But  Ralegh  in these and  many other Instances was so far from misusing that above the narrow Apprehensions of Repulse or laying himself under Obligations he appears to have exerted it in the most strenuous and generous Manner either for preventing or relieving the Distress of others which moved the greater Compassion when his own Misfortunes brought him to Need and yet to fail of the like liberal and successful Mediation for himself The Truth is  Ralegh  was so famous in these Days for such like good Offices that the Queen seems to have distinguished him by a Title more honourable in the proper Sense it is to be here taken than any other she conferred upon him for one Day having told her he had a Favour to beg of her  When Sir  Walter  said she will you cease to be a  Beggar To which he answered  When your gracious Majesty ceases to be a  Benefactor With great Justice therefore seems a certain noted Author of these Times to have adapted his Work to a Patron when he dedicated a Discourse upon  Friendship  which he published not long before this Time to Sir  Walter Ralegh  But Friendship made such a rare and lasting Impression on him that it may be said to have extended beyond the Life of the Object and he well deserves to be remembered in his Grave who could leave us such noble Patterns in memory of the Dead But this Place requires only our notice of the Memorial he wrote to clear from some  Spanish  Aspersions the F  me and Conduct of the valiant and renowned Sir  Richard Greenville  in that bloody Expedition where he made such a glorious though untimely End This brave Commander was Vice Admiral in the Lord  Thomas Howard  's Expedition to intercept the  Spanish  Plate Fleet at the Isles of  Azores  in its Return from  America  The  English  Squadron consisted of six of the Queen's Ships six Victuallers of  London  with two or three Pinnaces They set out early and waited six Months at  Flores  one of those Islands in Expectation of the said Fleet As there was besides the  English  Ships before numbered one also of Sir  Walter  's in this Expedition named  Bark Ralegh  commanded by Captain  Thynne  and as he employed some Time in the latter End of this Year to describe that memorable Engagement they had with the  Spaniards  the brief Abstract I shall give thereof from his own Words cannot be arraigned of Prolixity nor perhaps of Digression since besides his Gratitude for the past Services of his heroick Kinsman it so well displays his Sentiments at this Time of the religious Hypocrisies and Cruelties of their common Enemy The King of  Spain  therefore having had Intelligence of their waiting thus for his  Indian  Fleet sent an Armada to the  Azores  of fiftythree Sail to convoy it home under the Command of  Don Alphonso Baçan  This Fleet was just in sight of the  English  by then they had any warning of it and they were so unprepared for its Reception that many of their Crew were on Shore providing Ballast Water and other Necessaries and those who were on board were half of them through Sickness unfit for Service The  Spaniards  were now so near at hand that the  English  had scarce Time to weigh Anchor and  Greenville  in the  Revenge  was the last upon the Place being desirous of receiving all his Crew aboard from the Island whereof he had no less than ninety who were sick and diseased So that unable to recover the Wind and having but one hundred sound Men he was persuaded to cut his main Sail cast about and trust to the sailing of the Ship for the Squadron of  Seville  was on his Weatherbow  But he through the Greatness of his Spirit utterly refused to turn from the Enemy protesting he would rather die than be guilty of such Dishonour to himself his Country and her Majesty's Ship assuring his Company he would pass through the two Squadrons in spite of them and force those of  Seville  to give him Way which he performed upon divers of the foremost who as the Mariners term it sprung their Loof and fell under the Lee of the  Revenge  But while he had regard to those who were nearest the huge  San Philip  being in the Wind of him and approaching becalmed his Sails in such a manner that the Ship could neither make way nor feel the Helm so large and high charged was the  Spanish  Galleon being of fifteen hundred Ton carrying three Tire of eleven pieces in each on a Side and discharging eight foreright from her Chase besides those of her Sternports After the  Revenge  was thus entangled with this  Philip  four others loofing up also boarded her two on the Larboard and two on the Starboard The Fight thus beginning at Three a Clock in the Afternoon on the last of  August  the Year aforesaid continued very terrible all that Evening But  San Philip  having received the lower Tire of the  Revenge  charged with crossbar Shot shifted with all Expedition utterly misliking her first greeting Some said she founder'd hereupon but this is uncertain The  Spanish  Ships were filled with Soldiers some having two hundred besides Mariners some five others eight hundred Men in the  English  Ship there were only Mariners with the Commanders Servants and some Gentlemen Voluntiers After many Exchanges of great and small Shot the  Spaniards  many times attempted to board the  Revenge  but were as often beaten back into their own Ships or into the Sea and when a  London  Victualler who was under the Lee of the  Revenge  offered to undertake any Service for her Assistance  Greenville  bid him  "Save himself and leave him to his Fortune  The Fight thus continuing while the Day lasted and some Hours of the Night many of the  English  were slain some of the  Spanish  Ships sunk and in many others there was great Slaughter  Greenville  though wounded in the beginning of the close Fight was never so disabled as to forsake the upper Deck for eight Hours together and then being shot into the Body with a Musket as the Wound was dressing he was again shot into the Head and his Surgeon at the same time wounded to Death Still the Fight continued and as fast as the  Spaniards  were beaten off by the  Revenge  others came in their Places so that by Morning she had sustained for fifteen Hours together the Vollies Boardings and Entries of fifteen several Ships of War and repulsed them all besides the rest which battered her loose and at a distance But with the Light increased the Discovery of her dismal Condition and the more irksome was the one in that it would not let her conceal the other from her surrounding Enemies  As for her Friends the Lord  Thomas Howard  and the other Ships Sir  Walter Ralegh  further says of them  'If all the rest had entered all had been lost for the very hugeness of the  Spanish  Fleet if no other Violence had been offered would have crush'd them into Shivers of which the Dishonour and Loss to the Queen had been far greater than the Spoil or Harm that the Enemy could any way have received Notwithstanding it is true that the Lord  Thomas  would have entered between the Squadrons but the rest would not condescend and the Master of his own Ship offered to leap into the Sea rather than conduct it with the rest to be a Prey to the Enemy where there was neither Hope or Possibility either of Defence or Victory Which also in my Opinion says  Ralegh  had ill sorted with or answered the Discretion of a General to commit himself and his Charge to assured Destruction without hope or any likelihood of prevailing thereby to diminish the Strength of her Majesty's Navy and enrich the Pride and Glory of the Enemy The  Foresight  of the Queen's continues he commanded by Mr  Vasavour  performed a very great Fight and stayed two Hours as near the  Revenge  as the Weather would permit not forsaking the Fight till he was likely to be encompassed by the Squadrons and with great Difficulty cleared himself The rest gave divers Vollies of Shot and entered as far as the Place permitted and their own Necessities to keep the Weather Gage of the Enemy until they were parted by Night'  Thus in Sir  Walter Ralegh  's said  report  of this  fight  Now was to be  seen nothing but the naked Hull of a Ship and that almost a Skeleton having received Shot of great Artillery and some under Water her Deck covered with the Limbs and Carcasses of forty valiant Men the rest all wounded and weltering in or covered with their own Blood her Masts all beaten overboard all her Tackle cut asunder her upper Works razed and all in effect levelled with the Water incapable of any further Management or Motion but what the Billows gave her  Greenville  now finding their Distress irreparable commanded the Ship to be sunk that the  Spaniards  might not carry a Splinter home as a Trophy of their dearbought Victory dearbought indeed The  Admiral  of the  Spanish  Hulks and another great Galleon called the  Ascension  of  Seville  being both sunk by the side of the  Revenge  another also in the Road of St  Michael  and a fourth run herself aground to save her Company There were besides slain and drowned in this Fight two eminent  Spanish  Commanders and near a thousand of their Men as one of their own Officers who was severed from the Fight by the ensuing Storm and taken by a  London  Vessel confessed Sir  Richard  exhorted the Remainder of his  Company to trust in God's Mercy and to none else and as they had thus long and resolutely repulsed so many Enemies that they would not now lessen the Honour of their Country by any Overtures to lengthen for a few Hours or Days their own Lives Several joined in Opinion with him but the Majority prevailed who urged the  Spaniard  would be as ready to entertain a Composition as they to offer it and that there were divers valiant Men yet living who might do their Prince acceptable Service and revenge this Action upon the Enemy that the Ship could be of no Use either to the one or the other for upon the first working of the Sea she must needs sink being so crushed rived and leaky having six Foot Water in the Hold that she could never remove out of the Place  Accordingly the  Spanish  General Don  Alphonso Baçan  yielded that all their Lives should be saved the Company sent into  England  and the better Sort only to pay a reasonable Ransom free from all Gallies or Imprisonment Though the Mastergunner would have slain himself when he found their Resolution thus by Reason overborne but that he was by Force withheld Then the General sent many Boats aboard the  Revenge  and divers of the  English  suspecting Sir  Richard  's desperate Disposition to blow up or sink the Ship stole away to the  Spaniards  But the General prevailed upon him to remove out of the  Revenge  being very unsavory filled as it was like a Slaughterhouse with the Bodies and Blood of the dead and wounded Sir  Richard  told them they might do with his Body what they pleased for it was now of no Use to him and as he was carried out of the Ship he swooned but revived again and desired the Company to pray for him The General left nothing  unattempted for his Recovery highly respecting the unconquerable Resolution in so rare a Spectacle of consummate and approved Intrepidity who could make such Resistance for so long Time and such Havock upon such an  Armada  with a single Ship and so few Men Sir  Richard  lingered two or three Days and then died aboard the General who greatly bewailed his Loss  Lins  h  ten  a  Dutch  Author tho' he mistakes in some particulars as making this Engagement to have happened a Fortnight later c yet agrees with Sir  Walter Ralegh  that Sir  Richard  made a wonderful Opposition for he mentions  'no less than seven or eight Ships boarding the  Revenge  that she resisted them at least Hours that the  Spaniards  lost above Men in the Fight and that when Sir  Richard  was conveyed into the  Spanish  Admiral's Ship the  St Paul  all the Captains were astonished at his stout and couragious Heart for he shewed no Sign of Faintness nor Change of Colour but feeling the Hour of Death approach said in the  Spanish  Tongue  Here die I  Richard Greenvill  with a joyful and quiet Mind having ended my Life like a true Soldier that has fought for his Country Queen Religion and Honour  c He gives us further as an Instance of his Bravery that while he continued amongst the  Spanish  Captains and they were at Dinner or Supper with him he would carouse three or four Glasses of Wine and take the Glasses between his Teeth and crush them in Pieces and swallow them down so that often the Blood would run out of his Mouth without any other Harm to him'  but the  Revenge  with  Spaniards  in her being overtaken by the Storms aforesaid was sunk with the others abovementioned at St  Michael  's Island In this Manner did they honour the Burial of that renowned Ship and thus did she to the last make good her Name upon them  Ralegh  had formed an Enterprise upon  Panama  with a Design also of meeting the  Spanish  PlateFleet The Scheme he laid down appeared so feasible to her Majesty having provided no less than Ships of his own and his Associates all well  manned and plentifully furnished with Arms Provisions and all other Necessaries that she added to them two of her own Men of War named the  Garland  and  Foresight  and gave him a Commission constituting him General of the Fleet The Honour of Lieutenantgeneral was given to Sir  John Burgh  a Gentleman altogether worthy of the Command And indeed all his Consorts Officers Soldiers and Sailors were such as had given sufficient Proof of their Valour in divers Services With these Ships thus equipped  Ralegh  departed in  February  the Year aforesaid to the West of  England  there to store himself with such further Conveniences as he should need but the westerly Winds blowing for a long Time contrary bound him to keep Harbour so many Weeks that the fittest Season for his Purpose was expired and much of his Provisions consumed The Queen understanding how unluckily he was detained it being the th of  May  before  Raleigh  could put to Sea she sent Sir  Martin Forbisher  after him who overtook him the next Day with Letters of Revocation But  Ralegh  finding his Honour so far engaged in the Undertaking of this Voyage interpreting the Queen's Letters as if her Commands had been propounded in Terms of Latitude either to advance or retire at his own Discretion would by no Means consent to leave the Fleet now under Sail So he continued his Course upon the Seas 'till he met with a ship belonging to Mons  Gourdon  Governor of  Calais  in which was one Mr  Nevel Davies  who was returned from a twelve Years Captivity in  Spain  and who assured him there was little Hopes of any Success this Year in the  WestIndies  for the King of  Spain  had sent express Orders to all the Ports both of the  Islands  and  Terra Firma  that no Ships should stir that Year  nor any Treasure be laid aboard for  Spain  But neither this disagreeable News nor the other Discouragements could deter him from proceeding 'till on the th of  May  when he was off  Cape Finister  a most raging Tempest arising so scattered the greater Part of the Fleet and sunk his Boats and Pinnaces that as the Rest were driven and divided  Ralegh  himself in the  Garland  was in great Danger of being swallowed up in the Sea Hereupon considering the Season was too far gone for his Enterprise upon  Panama  and his Victuals too much consumed that the same Consumption might further disable him from lying upon the  Spanish  Coast or at the  Islands  to meet with the  Indian  Fleet for which he had received such little Encouragement to wait  Ralegh  made a Division of his Fleet into two Squadrons committing one under the Charge of Sir  John Burgh  and the other to Sir  Martin Forbisher  and gave his Instructions for Sir  Martin  in the  Garland  with Capt  Gifford  Capt  Thinne  Capt  Greenvill  and others to lie off the south Cape to terrify and keep the  Spaniards  on their own Coast while Sir  John Burgh  with Capt  Cross Thomson  and others should lie at the  Azores  for the Carracks from  India  The Success of these Directions was answerable to the excellent Judgment that contrived them For the  Spanish  Admiral receiving Intelligence that the  English  Fleet was cruising upon their Coast gathered all his naval Power to watch  Forbisher  and defend the southern Parts of  Spain  while the Carracks unguarded were left a Prey to Sir  John Burgh  Before the Fleet separated they met on the  Spanish  Coast with a great  Biscayan  called  Sancta Clara  a Snip of Ton which after a Fight for some Time they mastered and found freighted with all Sorts of little Ironwork valued by the  English  at  or thousand Pounds but of treble the value to the  Spaniards  This having cleared they sent to  England  Then Sir  John Burgh  in a Ship of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's named the  Roebuck  coasting along towards the South Cape of St  Vincent  and by the way spying a Sail gave her chase which being a Flyboat and good Sailor drew him far southward before he could fetch her at last she came under his Lee and struck sail The Master confess'd a great Fleet was prepared at St  Lucar  and  Cadiz  for the Rumour of  Ralegh  's putting out strong for the  WestIndies  had so alarmed the King of  Spain  that he raised this Fleet to oppose and encounter him though looking for the Arrival of his  EastIndia  Carracks he first ordered those Ships to convoy them from the  Azores  but persuading himself if  Ralegh  's Fleet did make for the  WestIndies  that then the Islands would be infested only by some small Men of War which the Carracks of themselves would be able to cope with his Order was to  Don Alphonso de Baçan  to pursue  Ralegh  's Fleet and engage him what Course soever he held and the  English  soon found this Information true For Sir  John Burgh  as he returned to his Company descried the  Spanish  Fleet to seaward of him which having likewise discovered him made full Account to bring him into the  Spanish  Harbour but he dexterously escaped them and shaped his Course to the  Azores  according to  Ralegh  's Directions Here he took several small Caravels but learnt little Intelligence from them Arriving at  Flores  on the st of  June  and making to the Shore of  Santa Cruz  he found them all in Arms but shewing a White Flag he was accommodated by the Inhabitants with whatever he wanted Here he learnt News of the  East Indian  Carracks one whereof had  lately passed by for  Lisbon  and that four more were behind He made after and soon discovered the  oremost named the  Santa Cruz  which was pressed so close upon by the  English  that she fired her self but they took besides some Spoil certain Prisoners out of her who confess'd that within fifteen Days three other great Carracks would arrive at the same Island Sir  John  having taken Co  el with his Officers departed six or seven Leagues to the West of  Flores  causing the Ships in his Company to spread themselves North and South two Leagues distant from each other by which Extension they could discover two whole Degrees Thus they lay till the d of  August  when Captain  Thompson  first saw that prodigious great Carrack called the  Madre de Dios  or  Mother of God  one of the greatest Burden belonging to the Crown of  Portugal  Captain  Thompson  first attacked her but with the loss of several Men then Sir  John Burgh  in the  Roebuck  aforesaid intangled her and Sir  Robert Cross  fastened himself to her at the same Instant But Sir  John  was forced to disengage awhile for Fear of sinking being shot under Water At last  Cross  fell athwart her all alone prevented her running ashore to fire herself as the other had done and gave the Rest Time to come up to his Succour which after he had fought with her three Hours he received by the Lord  Cumberland  's Ships And then having made a great Slaughter of the  Spaniards  they boarded and possessed themselves of her with little Difficulty  This Prize was reckoned the greatest and richest that ever had been brought into  England  and when the News of her being taken arrived  Ralegh  after Con  ultation with Sir  John Hawkins  wrote a Letter to the Lordadmiral in these Words  Our  very good Lord we have conferred together about the  EastIndian  Ship to be brought to  Plymouth  by Sir  John Burgh  and in our Opinions she can be no less worth than    l being a Ship of so great Burden and laden with so rich Commodities as appeareth she is Wherefore we have considered that the  Spanish  Men of War lying upon the Coast of  Bretagne  hearing of so great a Prize taken from the King or the Merchants of the Country and envying that such a Benefit should grow to us to their Hindrance and Dishonour will endeavour by all possible means being distant but a Day or Night's Sailing either to recover the Ship again or to burn her and all her Lading rather than she shall be deliver'd here seeing that the Places of Defence where the Ship may remain are not able to resist their Power In our Opinion therefore we think fit and do pray your Lordship that the three Ships of her Majesty's which are appointed to keep the narrow Seas may by your Lordship's Letter and Directions be appointed to go Westward and there to guard the  Indian  Ship for a Time until the  Garland  and some of the same Fleet be return'd whose Arrival cannot be any long Time expected or till some Order may be taken for the unlading or keeping of her otherwise which we pray your Lordship may be done with some Expedition And so we humbly take our Leave this    th of  August  Your Lordship's humbly at Commandment  W Ralegh  and underneath  John Hawkins By this Means this mighty Ship  This Carack was in Burden no less than Ton whereof were Merchandise She carried Pieces of brass Ordnance and between and Passengers was built with Decks seven Story one main Orlop three close Decks one Forecastle and a Sparedeck of two Floor apiece According to the Observations of Mr  Robert Adams  an excellent Geometrician she was in length from the Beakhead to the Stern Feet in breadth near Feet the length of her Keel Feet of the Main mast Feet its Circuit at the Partners near Feet and her Mainyard Feet  was  brought safe into  Dartmouth  on the th of  September  following where it daily drew vast Numbers of Spectators from all Parts to admire at the Hugeness of it being far beyond the Model of the biggest Shipping then known among us either for War or Burden  But as to the Lading tho' Sir  John Burgh  did prudently seize upon the whole to her Majesty's Use to prevent all licentious Spoil whereby the Treasure brought home was sufficient to recompense the Adventurers Cost and the Sailors Peril however the Dividends are not known more than that her Majesty had the largest Share and though through the Varieties thereof our Nation was let into the Discovery of those Merchandises whereof we had before but an im  erfect Knowledge yet the whole Cargo when it came to be▪landed and valued in  England  fell short above two Thirds of the Computation which had been made by  Ralegh  and  Hawkins  as above  As to her Lading according to the Catalogue taken at  Leade  hall  the th of  September  this Year the principal Wares consisted of Spices Drugs Silks Callicoes Carpets Quilts Cloth of the Rind of Trees Ivory  Porcellan  or  China  Ware Ebony besides Pearl Musk Civet and Ambergris with many other Commodities of inferior Value The  Cargason  freighted ten of our Ships for  London  and was by moderate Computation valued at  l  Sterling  For a large Quantity of Jewels were never brought to Light and so much of her other Goods was also purloin'd by the Sailors Soldiers and Officers that at her Arrival in  England  she drew five Foot less Water than she did when she was first freighted at  Cochin  in the  EastIndies  And indeed the Sailors boldly confess'd  They had rather trust their Souls to a merciful God by Perjury than their Fortunes to the Hands of unmerciful Men  The latter end of this Year and Beginning of next we meet with Sir  Walter Ralegh  in the ParliamentHouse whether return'd for a County or a Borough and for which does not at present particularly occur A late Author of his Life observes  that his Speeches were full of Reason and Eloquence no Man in his Days being more a Master of Language than himself  and Matter too he might have added none more satisfactorily confirming his Arguments with Facts and Experience than he did even in his unpremeditated Speeches no less than in the more deliberate Compositions of his Pen so full of Observation he was upon all Times and Countries and so readily he could apply it upon all Occasions which now won him great Regard as a Speaker in the House and afterwards as an Author to the whole World Soon after the opening of the Session we find him upon the Committee for the Liberties and Privileges of the Members to examine and make Report of all Cases touching the Elections and Returns during the said Session of Parliament Also in another against Popish Recusants And when  the Bill for certain Subsidies  to be granted her Majesty was in Debate and some Members were for having it expresly distinguish'd in the Bill that the said Subsidies should be for maintaining a War impulsive and defensive against the  Spaniard  that the Conquests we made over them might be legal and waarrantable Sir  Walter Ralegh  seconded those Speeches and said  He knew many who held it not lawful in Conscience as the Time was to take Prizes from the  Spaniard  and he knew that if it might be lawful and open War there would be more voluntary Hands  to fight against the  Spaniard  than the Queen should stand in need of to send to Sea  Accordingly he was appointed of the Committee for drawing the Articles and Preamble of the said Bill Further when the Necessity of the said Subsidy came to be enforc'd  Ralegh  spake for it  not only  as he protested  to please the Queen to whom he was infinitely bound above his Deserts but for the Neeessity be both saw and knew  He very well discover'd the great Strength of the King of  Spain  and to shew his Mightiness he told how he possess'd all the World as also that his Malice and ill Purpose was evident to this Realm he shewed how on every Side he had beleaguer'd us  That in  Denmark  the King being young had corrupted the Council and Nobility so as it was very likely he would speed himself of Shipping from thence In the marine Towns of the  LowCountries  and in  Norway  he laid in great Store of Shipping In  France  he had the Parliament Towns at his Command in  Britany  he had all the best Havens and in  Scotland  had so corrupted the Nobility that he had promis'd them Forces to assist the Papists that they were ready to join with any foreign Forces that would make them strong to be by themselves and resist others for as he thought there were not six Gentlemen of that Country of one Religion In his own Counry there is all possible preparing and he is coming with sixty Gallies besides other Shipping with Purpose to annoy us We must then have no Ships if he invade us riding at Anchor all will be little enough to withstand him At his coming he fully resolveth to get  Plymouth  or at least to possess some of the Havens this Summer within our Land and  Plymouth  is a Place of most Danger for no Ordnance can be carried thither to remove him the Passages will not give leave Now the Way to defeat him is to send a Royal Army to supplant him  in  Britany  and to possess ourselves there and to send a strong Navy to Sea and to lie upon the  Cape  and at  Lambuck  to which Places come all his Ships with Riches from all Parts and then they may set upon all that come This we are able to do and undoubtedly with fortunate Success if we undertake it  But some Division arising upon the Question how they should make the Motion for this Supply to the Lords  Ralegh  made so judicious a Distinction of the Cause thereof and so clearly demonstrated the erroneous Manner in which it had been propounded that it appears plainly the successful Turn which follow'd thereupon was owing to him alone After this Conference several Forms of Provision were propos'd by way of treble Subsidies and like proportionable Fifteenths and Tenths with other Kinds of Benevolence Sir  Thomas Cecil  was for three Subsidies to be paid in four Years and to be charged upon Men of ten Pounds and upwards to spare those who were under Sir  Henry Knivet  alledged the Poverty of our Country against the Reasons used and imputed that Poverty to the bringing in more foreign Wares than we vented Commodities whereby our Money was carried out of our Country which was thus become like a Pond that was fed with a Spring but having a Breach through which more passed away than came in Thereupon moved for a Survey to be taken of all Men's Lands and Goods in  England  and so much to be yearly levied as might maintain the Queens Wars the Proportion being set Pounds yearly or if that was misliked every Man on his Word should deliver in to his Power the Profits of his Lands and Goods so a Proportion to be cess'd accordingly To him who argued of the Poverty of the Land from the Multitude of Beggars  Ralegh  gave these Reasons  That the broken  Companies in  Normandy  and the  LowCountries  who returned maimed higher never went back again to the Towns from whence they came For a Multitude of Clothiers taking their Looms into their Hands spun their Wool themselves and except we would work for them cheaper than they can make themselves they will set none to work This engrossing of so many Trades into their own Hands beggars so many as usually lived by the Trade  As for the surveying of so many Men's Estates he thought it inconvenient  For many being esteemed richer than they are would be found Beggars and increase the Opinion of their Number by losing their Credit which is now their Wealth He further reported of his own Knowledge that the  WestCountry  since the Parliament begun had taken from them the Worth of    Pounds and that those of  Newcastle  lay still for fear because the  Bourdeaux  Fleet was taken this Year by the Enemy For the Enemy approaching us and being become our Neighbour our Trades will decay every Day and so our Poverty increases Thus it is most certain the longer we defer Aid the less able we shall be to yield it yet in the End the greater Aid will be required so sparing them now we shall charge them when they shall be less able to bear it For it is most true    Pounds would have done the last Year that which three will not now do and three will do this Year that which six will not do hereafter  In the Conclusion he agreed to three Subsidies in them the Threepound Men to be spared the Sum which came from them to be lev  upon those of ten Pound and upwards and the Payment to be speedy Mr  Francis Bacon  assented to three Subsidies but not to the Payments under six Years But to his Reasons of Difficulty and Danger in a speedier Levy which might hazard a double Peril by making it four Shillings in the Pound a  double Payment  Ralegh  answer'd  I see no Reason that the Suspicion of Discontentment should cross the Provision for the present Danger The Time is now more dangerous than it was in Eightyeight for then the  Spaniard  coming from  Spain  was to pass dangerous Seas and had no Place of Retreat or Relief if he fail'd But now he has in  Britany  great Store of Shipping a Landing place in  Scotland  and Men and Horses there as good as any we have But for the Difficulty in getting this Subsidy I think it seems more difficult by  speaking  than it would be in  gathering In the End it was carried agreeable to his Propositions  Soon after there was a  Bill  read in the House  against counterfeiting the Hands of Counsellors or principal Officers  and upon the second reading it was committed to Sir  John Woolley  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  with others But after a Meeting in the  Middle Temple  Hall Sir  John  made Report to the House that himself and the Residue of the Committee upon the End of their Examination did think it a very dangerous Bill and not fit to pass the House But the  Bill against Aliens selling foreign Wares among us by Retail  produced several weighty Arguments and Speeches in the House which have been transmitted to us These Foreigners were  Dutchmen  who had nestled themselves in  St Martins  antiently allow'd for a Sanctuary and therefore still had this Privilege Here they practis'd Spinning and Weaving to the great Detriment and Complaint of Merchants and regular Dealers in our own City insomuch that threescore  English  Retailers had been ruin'd by them since the last Parliament to the Diminution besides their own private Substance of the Queen's Subsidy and the publick Treasure  l  a Year at least having been carried out of the Realm by them They  had indeed some learned Council who pleaded for them at the Bar and some of the Members spoke in their Behalf Other Arguments were used but against these  Ralegh  concur'd with those who thought that Denization ought not to circumvent Birth right and that to behave ourselves like Citizens to Foreigners was but making ourselves Strangers to our Neighbours  Whereas it is pretended  says he  that for Strangers it is against Charity against Honour against Profit to expel them in my Opinion it is no Matter of  Charity  to relieve them For first such as fly hither have forsaken their own King and Religion is no Pretext for them for we have no  Dutchmen  here but such as come from those Princes where the Gospel is preach'd yet here they live disliking our Church For  Honour  It is Honour to use Strangers as we be used among Strangers and it is a Lightness in a Commonwealth yea a Baseness in a Nation to give a Liberty to another Nation which we cannot receive again In  Antwerp  where our Intercourse was most we were never suffer'd to have a Taylor or a Shoemaker to dwell Nay at  Milan  where there are Three hundred Pound  Englishmen  they cannot so much as have a Barber among them And for  Profit  they are all of the House of  Almoigne  who pay nothing yea eat out our Profits and supplant our own Nation Custom indeed they pay paying FifteenPence where we pay TwelvePence but they are discharged of Subsidies The Nature of the  Dutchman  is to fly to no Man but for his Profit and they will obey no Man long now under  Spain  now under  Mountfort  now under the Prince of  Orange  but under no Governor long The  Dutchman  by his Policy hath gotten Trading with all the World into his Hands yea he is now entring into the Trade of  Scarborough  Fishing and the Fishing of the  Newfoundlands  which is the Stay of the  WestCountries  They are the People that maintain the King of  Spain  in his Greatness were it not for them he were never able to make out such Armies and Navies by Sea it cost her Majesty    l a Year the maintaining of these Countries and for all this they arm her Enemies against her Therefore I see no Reason that such Respect should be given to them And to conclude in the whole no Matter of Honour no Matter of Charity no Profit in relieving them  This Speech we may meet with in some modern Writings quoted in Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Praise both for his Knowledge in the Interest of his Country and his unbiass'd Affection in exerting it As for the Bill he was one to whom it was committed and who after the Travels of the said Committee upon it offered it again to the House with the addition of a Proviso On the th of  March  following that is to say in the Year it was read the third time and after many long Speeches which are not specify'd passed upon the Question by the Division of the House with the difference of fourscore Voices the  Yeas  being the  Noes  About a Week afterwards there was a Bill for explaining a Branch in  an Act to retain the Queen's Subjects in due Obedience  read and many Speeches pass'd in the House before it was committed through the many Imperfections in the Preamble and Body of the said Bill For it pretended a Punishment only of the  Brownists  and other Sectaries but alledging nothing against them in particular contained some ensnaring Clauses that might comprehend more innocent Persons As the Speeches before Sir  Walter Ralegh  's on this Occasion are not rehearsed we can only guess at them by what is preserved of his who said  In my Conceit the  Brownists  are  worthy to be rooted out of a Commonwealth  This Sect was so called from  Robert Brown  Son of  Anthony Brown  Esq of  Tolethorp  in  Rutlandshire  and Grandson of  Francis Brown  whom King  Henry  VIII  Anno Regn  privileged by Charter to wear his Cap in Presence of himself his Heirs or any of his Nobles and not to uncover but at his own Pleasure This  Robert  studied Divinity in  Cambridge  and was soon discovered by Dr  Still  Master o  Trini  yCollege  to have somewhat extraordinary in him that would pro  great Disturbance to the Church He travelled to  Zeland  an  etu  ed as we are told confirmed in Error and Obstinacy▪ which he first preached at  Norwith Anno  and wrote a Book to jus  i  y his Doctrine for which Bishop  Phreak  of that Diocese confined him But being related to the Lord  Burg  e    and he rather imputing it to Zeal than Malice interceded to have him c  aritably per  aded out of his Opinions and released The lat  er being done he was sent home in but remain'd incorrigible w  erefore his good old Father would own him for his Son no long  r than his Son own'd the Church of  England  for his Mother but he chose rather to part with his aged Sire than his new Schism So with  Richard Harrison  a Schoolmaster he set up for an Orator against Bishops and all Ecclesiastical Authority When Gentleness was found ineffectual Severity was so long and upon so many Occasions exercis'd that this  Brown  used to boast he had been committed to  Thirtytwo Prisons and in some could not see his Hand at Noonday  yet did he to the last save his Life and Living which was  Achurch  in  Northamptonshire  This Favour is conceived to proceed from the Promises he made of Conformity together with the Interest of his powerful Kindre  He allowed a Salary for one to disch  rge his Cure and tho' he opposed  is Parishioners in Judgment yet agreed in taking their Tithes He was of a Nature uncontrolable so far from the  Sabbatarian  Strictness afterwards espoused by some of his Followers that he seemed rather a Libertine therein In a Word he had says my Author a Wife with whom he never lived and a Church in which he never preached tho' he received the Profits thereof and as all the other Scenes of his Life were stormy and turbulent fo was his End for the Constable of his Parish requiring somewhat roughly the Payment of certain Rates his Passion moved him to Blows▪ w  ereof Complaint being made to Justice  St John  he rather inclin'd to pity than punish him but  Brown  at fair Words also disgusted ceased not till he was sent to  Northampton  Jail on a Bed in a Cart being very infirm▪ and aged above Years where soon after he sicken'd and died  Anno      but what  Danger may grow to ourselves if this Law pass were fit to be considered For it is to be feared that Men not guilty will be included in it and that Law is hard that taketh Life and sendeth into Banishment where Mens  Intentions  shall be judged by a Jury and they shall be Judges what another means But that Law which is against a Fact is but just and punish the Fact as severely as you will If    or  Brownists  m  et at the Sea at whose Charge shall they be transported or whither will you send them I am sorry for it but I am afraid there are near    of them in  England  and when they are gone who shall maintain their Wives and Children  A Committee was therefore appointed to revise and correct this Bill among whom  Ralegh  is the foremost named And being read the third Time it passed upon the Question  This Year we met with a notable Libel in print set forth by a  Lover of his Country  as he calls himself to expose certain Ministers and Counsellors of State who had been instrumental in framing that searching Proclamation against the  Seminaries  which was published about two Years before For the King of  Spain  having lately founded an  English  Cloyster at  Valladolid  as a Nursery to supply us with Treason and Rebellion so many hopeful Stocks of that Species were soon transplanted into  England  as occasioned the said Proclamation to extirpate them Now this Answer was published to calumniate the supposed Authors of it and as  Ralegh  appears among other very good Company to have his Share of the Slander therein so he might probably have had a Hand in those wholesome Articles for the Safety of the Realm which occasioned it For after this Libel has reviled the greatest and wisest Ministers of the Nation it seems to have reserved the Quintessence for him who had the Ability so many Ways to  crush the pernicious Purposes which were daily hatching by the viperous Brood which brought it forth For  Ralegh  had given such Proofs of his sound and sincere Affection to Religion that his Sentiments were made use of to reform or regulate even the Professors of it yet now his Head must be turn'd so excessively to its Detriment as to provoke this Libeller's pious Spleen against nothing less than Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  School of Atheism  compendiously insinuating as if truly he was not satisfied with being a Disciple but set up for a Doctor in his Faculty and won young  Gentlemen into his said School wherein the Old and New Testament were jested at and Scholars taught to spell  God  backwards  Then he complains  what a miserable Thing it is that her Majesty should make Laws and Proclamations according to these Mens Senses and Opinions  But there may need little Pains to blunt the Point of this Dart when we shall further consider that it came out of a Jesuitical Quiver for by whom should it be levelled against him but  Robert Parsons  the notorious Traitor and Incendiary However deeply he disguis'd himself into a  Lover of his Country  Nevertheless some ten Years after when  Ralegh  was trampled down by the Court and there was a Turn of State to serve this might be a good serviceable Obloquy enough to upbraid him with and depreciate him in the Eye of the Populace But these prejudiced Representations will probably be thought of so little Authority that the Reasons and Matter of Fact which have been produc'd in a poetical Performance may be sufficien to make those Stains even befriend his Reputation and brighten it in clearing them away  The late Dr  George Sewell  in his Tragedy of Sir  Walte  Ralegh  vo Act I Scene I makes the following Re+flection on the Attorney General's starting from the Question in  bate at  Ralegh  's Trial to upbraid him with this imputation Atheism  Sir Julius Caesar  When Prejudice and strong Aversion work  All whose Opinions we dislike are  Atheists  Now 'tis a Term of Art a bugbear Word  The Villain's Engine and the Vulgar's Terror  The Man who thinks and judges for himself  Unsway'd by aged Follies rev'rend Errors  Grown holy by traditionary Dullness  Of SchoolAuthority he is an  Atheist  The Man who hating idle Noise preserves

Providence at Sea  And saw his Wonders in the mighty Deep  The AtheistSailor were a monstrous Thing  More wonderful than all old Ocean breeds  But I will witness for my  Ralegh  's Faith  Yes I have seen him when the Tempest rag'd  When from the Precipice of MountainWaves  All Hearts have trembled at the Gulph below  He with a steddy supplicating Look  Display'd his Trust in that tremendous Pow'r  Who curbs the Billows and cuts short the Wings  Of the rude Whirlwind in its midway Course  And bids the Madness of the Waves to cease  O  FellowSoldier  were that Folly thine  Tho' thou wert dearer than the Love of Honour  To this old Bosom I would pluck thee hence  Tho' my Heart crack'd  Indeed there is a traditional Author who ac  unts for the Grounds of this Aspersion in the llowing Words  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was the first  s I have heard who ventured to tack about and il aloof from the beaten Tract of the  Schools  and ho upon the discovery of so apparent an Error as  Torrid Zone  intended to proceed in an Inquisition  after more solid Truths till the Mediation of some whose Livelihood lay in hammering  Shrines  for this superannuated  Study  possessed Queen  Elizabeth  that such Doctrine was against God no less than her Father's Honour whose Faith if he owned any was grounded upon  SchoolDivinity  whereupon she chid him who was by his own Confession ever after branded with the Title of an Atheist though a known Assertor of God and Providence  That he was such Assertor seems to be affirmed by an Author of his Acquaintance who introduces the Apparition of Sir  Walter  speaking to him in this Manner  Thou well knowest that the World hath at sundry Times cast a foul and most unjust Aspersion upon me for my presumed denial of a Deity from which abominable and horrible Crime I was ever most free and not any Man now living better knows the same than thyself in whose Presence I was often accustomed highly to praise and esteem the Book of  Lessius  written in Proof of the Being of a Deity  So requests that he would translate the same into  English which I myself  says the Ghost  had done if cruel Fate had not untimely cut off the Thread of my Mortality and let the Title bear my Name that so the Readers may acknowledge it was done by my Sollicitation  Then the said Translator of that Book says in his own Person to the Reader▪  It is well known that Sir  Walter  was a Man of great natural Parts and yet was suspected of the most foul and execrable Crime of Atheism how truly God and himself only knows  yet I have reason to think it a false Aspersion If thus much is said of  Ralegh  by an Author who knew him what Credit shall we pay to another who wrote many Years later Never knew him produces no Authority for the Principles he charges upon him yet pretends to give us the Tutor's Name from whom he  imbibed them and that a Man of no less Learning and Merit than the famous Mr  Thomas Hariot  This was that  English  Philosopher from whose illustrious Discoveries he who was the Glory of the  French  Philosophers is not denied to have borrowed much of the Light wherewith he shone  This Assertion will further appear to any who shall have the Curiosity to consult the late learned Dr  John Wallis  in his Treatise of  Algebra  where he compares the Improvements which  Hariot  made with what  Descartes  has advanced as his own without mentioning the Name of this  Englishman  in his Geometry and gives it clearly on  Hariot  's Side Nay this P  agiarism was so well known as to have been objected against Monsieur  Descartes  in his own Country and the  Frenchman  who has paid the singular Honours to his Memory of writing his Life having confessed it was the Opinion of some that he stole his Method of Algebra from one  Hariot  an  Englishman  does not go about to contradict it  This was that excellent Mathematician who says our Author  Wood  aforesaid  coming to the Knowledge of this heroick Knight Sir  Walter Ralegh  was entertained by him in his Family who allowed him a yearly Pension and was instructed by him at leisure Hours in that Science  This was that virtuous and religious Man who being sent over by Sir  Walter Ralegh  with his first Colony to  Virginia  but did not bear him Company as the said Author mistakes to survey the Bounds of the  English  Discoveries with the Commodities and Customs of the Country did first communicate the Gospel to those heathen Inhabitants and  in every Town where he came explained to them the Contents of the Bible declaring that therein was set forth the true and only  God  and his mighty Works that therein was contained the true Doctrine of Salvation through  Christ  with many Particulars of Miracles and chief Points of Religion as I was able then to utter  continues he  and thought fit for the Time And though I told them the Book materially  and of itself was not of such Virtue as I thought they did conceive but only the Doctrine therein contained yet would many be glad to touch it to embrace it to kiss it to hold it to their Breasts and Heads and stroke over all their Bodies with it to shew their hungry desire of that Knowledge which was spoken of  Yet this is the Man whom the abovecited  Anthony Wood  charges with having had strange Thoughts of the Scripture with undervaluing the old Story of the Creation with never believing that trite Position  Ex nihilo nihil fit  with making a  philosophical Theology  wherein he cast off the  Old Testament  so that consequently the  New  would have no Foundation Further with being a Deist and imparting his Doctrine to the Earl of  Northumberland  into whose Service  Ralegh  had recommended him and of whom he also received a yearly Pension of  l  Lastly with infusing those Principles likewise into Sir  Walter Ralegh  himself when he was compiling his  History of the World  This last Insinuation and probably all the rest is surely a manifest Slander as  Wood  himself must have owned if he had sufficiently read that  History of the World  where Sir  Walter Ralegh  has in many Places given stronger Evidences of his Christian Faith than any of his Detractors ever did of theirs  As for  Ralegh  what might not a little sharpen these Detractions against him was perhaps a Grant about this Time made him from the Crown of some Church Lands a Course of Reward usual with Queen  Elizabeth  towards such as had performed any considerable Services for the State The Story as we are forced to gather it from those Authors by whom it has not been overfavourably told is That about the Year the Bishop of  Salisbury  Dr  John Coldwell  who had been bred  a Physician gave his See a strong Purge by alienating the Mannor of  Sherborne  to Sir  Walter Ralegh  Sir  John Harrington  speaks of an ominous Presage to make his Tale as affecting as he can to Prince  Henry  and insinuate the Displeasure even of Heaven against Sir  Walter Ralegh  where he observes  That Sir  Walter  using often to ride Post in these Days upon no small Employments between  Plymouth  and the Court when  Sherborne  Castle being right in the Way he cast such an Eye upon it as  Ahab  did upon  Naboth  's Vineyard and once above the rest being talking of it of the Commodiousness of the Place of the Strength of the Seat and how easily it might be got from the Bishoprick suddenly over and over came his Horse that his very Face which was then thought a very good Face ploughed up the Earth where he fell This Fall was ominous I make no question  says he  as the like was observed in the Lord  Hastings c  but his Brother  Adrian  would needs have him interpret that not as a Courtier but as a Conqueror it presaged the quiet Possession thereof And this through the Queen's Favour came to pass  For after Dr  John Piers  was translated to  York  this Dr  Coldwell  was elected to succeed him in the See of  Salisbury  but it lay vacant three Years in which dangerous Juncture for denial all the Doctor's ChurchPreferments being disposed of yet before his Election was confirmed Sir  Walter Ralegh  importuned him to pass  Sherborne  to the Crown and effected it so shot the good old Man as one of them phrases it  between Wind and Water  though indeed confessed a good round Rent was reserved to the Bishoprick Then Sir  Walter  begged the same of the Queen and obtained it much after the same Method that Sir  William Killigrew  got the Mannor of  Crediton  from the Church of  Exeter  by the  Consent of Bishop  Babington Ralegh  embellished his Sovereign's Bounty with great Magnificence and Commendation not that he was in danger thereby of falling under the Remark he has made on common Builders of sumptuous Seats  That Men are rather known by their  Houses  than their  Houses  by them  Yet his elegant Taste in Building is sufficiently attested by an Author who surveyed the Improvements he made upon this Estate when they were fresh and in their Splendour and who tells us  That the Queen having granted the Feefarm of  Sherborne  to Sir  Walter Ralegh  he began to build the Castle very fairly but altering his Purpose he built in the Park adjoining a most fine House which he beautified with Orchards Gardens and Groves of much Variety and great Delight so that whether you consider the Pleasantness of the Seat the Goodness of the Soil or other Delicacies belonging to it it rests  says he  unparallele  by any in these Parts  How he came afterwards to be juggled out of it may also sufficiently appear when we arrive at the latter Part of his Life But here we may take an Opportunity of remembring a Plantation of his which is somewhat observable A late Author mentions it with respect to him but in a distant Manner where telling us  That  Beddington  near  Croydon  in  Surrey  is a neat curious Seat built by Sir  Francis Carew he further adds  The Orchards and Gardens are very pleasant and especially famous for the Orange Trees which have now grown there above these hundred Years being planted in the open Ground under a moveable Court during the Winter Months they were the first that were brought into  England  by a Knight of that noble Family who deserves no less Commendation than  Lucullus  met with for bringing Cherry and FilbertTrees out of  Pontus  into  Italy  for which he is celebrated by  Pliny  and others  Addition to  Camden  's  Britannia  translated by the present Bishop of  London  fol pag upon which we may observe tho' the  English  have not been so grateful as the  Romans  were in celebrating those worthy Persons who have made the like beneficial Importations to the lasting Ornament and Fertility of their Country yet that we have had some Authors not altogether silent in these vegetable Antiquities from whom we learn that Dr  Linacre  first brought into this Land that Prince of Flowers the  Damask Rose  that the  Perdigwen Plum  with two Kinds more were first made Natives of this Soil by  Thomas  Lord  Cromwell  when he returned from his Travels and the  Apricock  by a Priest named  Wolfe  Gardener to King  Henry  VIII In this Reign were also first propagated among us  Hops  and  Artichokes  and then were  Cherry  Orchards first planted here about  Sittingborne  in  Kent  with a more improved Kind of that Fruit brought from  Flanders  by one  Harris  another of that King's Gardeners But what effect  Cardan  's Recommendation of  OliveTrees  had with King  Edward  VI I find not In the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  when  Edmund Grindal  afterwards Archbishop of  Canterbury  returned from Exile he first transported the  Tamerick  so useful in Medicine against Diseases of the Spleen Then also after our opening a Trade with  Zant  the Shrub which bears the Currans was first transplanted hither In the Tulip first shewed her gaudy Garment in  English  Ground and lastly not to extend further on this Subject now as for the profitable Plant Tobacco and that princely one the OrangeTree enough is said above in the Body of this Work to the Honour of Sir  Walter Ralegh  Now it has been a constant Tradition at  Beddington  that this Knight of that noble Family was Sir  Walter Ralegh  who was allied thereto if not otherwise by the last of that Sirname's adopting his near Kinsman a  Throgmorton  to be his Heir on Condition that he would assume the Name and Arms of  Carew  and how  Ralegh  became related to the  Throgmortons  will in a little Space appear But that we might not here want such further Confirmation of the first Planter of that famous Orangery I have been obliged with the Gentleman's  Answer  to the  Enquiry  who now dwells at  the Seat and his Words are  'Tis the common Opinion of this Family that Sir  Walter Ralegh  who was related to it brought over and planted the old Orange Trees here  But in the House they preserved a fine Cabbin Bed which was his having Furniture of green Silk and Legs carved like Dolphins gilt with Gold In short the Seat was now so frequented that not only  Raleigh  and other Courtiers but the Queen received here many agreeable Entertainments  Sir  Hugh Plat  informs us  'That delicate Knight Sir  Francis Carew  once making a splendid Entertainment for Queen  Elizabeth  at  Beddington  led her Majesty after Dinner to a CherryTree in his Garden which had on it Fruit in their Prime then above a Month after all Cherries had taken their farewell of  England  This Retardation he performed by straining a Tent or Canvas Cover over the whole Tree and wetting it as the Weather required with a Scoop so by obstructing the SunBeams they grew both great and were very long before they gained their perfect Cherrycolour and when he was assured of the Time her Majesty would come he removed the Tent and a few sunny Days brought them to their full Maturity'  See his  Garden of Eden  mo pag  for some of which she could not escape the Censure of her jesuited Enemies  As to the Seat at  West Horseley  in  Surrey  there is good Authority that it was in the Possession of his Son if not his own and in the Hall of that House there are in several Places of the Walls and Cieling the Arms of  Ralegh  still visible But there is a House no farther from  London  than  Islington  about a Bow's Shot on this Side the Church which though I think it has no such Evidences remaining upon its Walls Cielings or Windows that will prove him to have been its Owner the Arms that are seen there above a hundred Years old being of a succeeding Inhabitant is yet popularly reported to have been a  villa  of his For the present Tenant affirms  His Landlord was possessed  of some old Account Books by which it appears beyond all doubt this House and fourteen Acres of Land now let at about seventy Pounds  per Annum  did belong to Sir  Walter Ralegh  and that the oldest Man in the Parish would often declare his Father bad told him Sir  Walter  purposed to wall in that Ground with intention to keep some of his Horses therein further that some Husbandmen ploughing up the same a few Years since found several Pieces of Queen  Elizabeth  's Money whereof they brought whatever they might reserve to themselves about fourscore Shillings to their Master the said Tenant  in whose Hands I have seen of the said Coin As for the House it is and has been for many Years an Inn so that what it was is not clearly to be judged from its present outward Appearance it being much impaired or very coarsely repaired and diminished perhaps from what it might be when Persons of Distinction lived in it However there are within fide some spacious Rooms the Parlour was painted round the uppermost Part of the Wainscot in about a dozen Pannels with Scripture Histories but now so old and decayed as to be scarcely distinguishable There is also a noble DiningRoom the Cieling whereof is all over wrought in  plastick  or fret Work with Representations of the  Five Senses  and the Chimneypiece with the  Three principal Christian Virtues  But the Arms in the Window as well as in that of the Hall are by the present Inhabitants erroneously called Sir  Walter Ralegh  's there being a Date under one of the Coats which shews it was  aneal'd  six Years after his Death So that we are not sure the Decorations aforesaid were done by his Direction or that others more rich and elegant were not in their stead before them As for his Dwellings in  London  we have read before that he had Apartments in the  Court at  Somerset  House and shall read hereafter of some Acquaintance resorting to him at  Durham  House in the  Strand  that he had a House by the  Thames  Side which might be the same and another at St  James  's or Apartments also in the Court there  The Truth is Sir  Walter Ralegh  did not live so long at Court and so much about the dazzling Beauties in it without having the Wings of his Glory at last somewhat sing'd in the Flames thereof yet Love which in some great Courtiers of those Times was the grand Business of their Life seemed only an Interlude in his There was among the Queen's Maids of Honour a beautiful young Lady as her Picture represents her named  Elizabeth  Daughter of Sir  Nicholas Throgmorton  an able Statesman and Ambassador whose Negociations and Characters are recorded both by the  French  and  Scotch  as well as  English  Historians of those Times With this Lady  Ralegh  had it seems an Amour and as he was a Man of nervous Address won her Heart even to the last Favour inclusive This Intimacy came at last to the Queen's Knowledge whether enviously betrayed by any female Confident as some might apprehend from a Character  Ralegh  would bestow upon the Ladies of the PrivyChamber and BedChamber being wont to say  They were like Witches who could do hurt but could do no good  or whether the Intrigue could not be long concealed for the Fruits of it as some who manifestly slander  Ralegh  in other Particulars have not scrupled to suggest the Reader has it in his Choice to believe But in such Colours this Matter of devirginating a Maid of Honour was heightened that  Ralegh  was out of Favour again also in Confinement for several Months and when enlarged forbidden the Court whence the Lady also was dismissed  from her Attendance Yet as heinous as this Misdemeanour was in  Ralegh  her Majesty did not punish it in  Leicester Essex  and other Courtiers noted in their Days for such Intrigues especially the former who turned off  Douglas Sheffield  by whom he had a Son to marry the Earl of  Essex  's Mother But  Ralegh  very readily made the most honourable Reparation he could by marrying the Object of his Affection It appears they lived together ever after in the most exemplary Degree of conjugal Harmony and when he was in his greatest Troubles there are Testimonies from one who was otherwise none of his greatest Friends of her extraordinary Diligence and Fidelity in making Interest and Applications to assuage them What his Thoughts were of a married Life in comparison with a single one may somewhat appear in that Observation he made upon a certain Nobleman's growing plump after Matrimony who was meagre before for another Person in Company remarking thereupon that it fared with him contrary to what it did with other married Men who usually at first became lean after it  Ralegh  very pleasantly obviated the Rarity by saying  Why there is no Beast that if you take him from the  Common  and put him into the  Several  but he will grow fat  Many Years afterwards when  Ralegh  wrote his  Instructions to his Son  he sufficiently explained this Sentiment in the grave and paternal Manner he is then writing for his Conduct in the  Choice of a Wife  which Topick he concludes with advising him  to bestow his Youth so that he may have comfort to remember it when it has forsaken him  And  That his Son would evermore care to be beloved  by  his Wife than be besotted  on  her  That  if he cannot forbear to  Love  yet forbear to  Link However approves of a mature and settled  Choice at last even while he is upon the Stage of his Virility  For believe it the young Wife betrayeth the old Husband and she that had thee not in thy  Flower  will despise thee in thy  Fall But not to marry for Beauty only  left thou bind thyself for Life to that which perchance will never last or please one Year  Nor yet an uncomely Woman  as much regard being due at least to our own Issue as to any other Race of Creatures and Comeliness in Children is Riches if nothing else be left them  He remains pretty safe in this Opinion from many Censures by the hardfavoured Part of the Sex because he knew that few Ladies would be positive upon this Head in their Right to reprove him nor will Widows believe he has treated them with Rigour while they remain in that State since he has said  Leave not thy Wife to be a Shame unto thee after thou art dead but that she may live according to thy Estate especially if thou hast few Children and those provided for  Though he does also further say  Leave her no more than of Necessity thou must but only during her Widowhood for if she Love again let not her enjoy her second Love in the same Bed wherein she loved thee nor fly to future Pleasures with those Feathers which Death hath pulled from thy Wings  Not that he was averse to second Marriages for he advised his own Wife to marry again when he was in Expectation of being suddenly divided from her for ever Many other weighty Admonitions may be found relating to that Sex among his Writings some of which we meet with quoted by our most accomplished Humanists and Criticks in the Manners and Passions of Life as from an Author who had read their Hearts thro' all their Veils and Disguises But one of those Writers tho' he allows him all the advantageous Views of Life through such a Variety of Scenes as  having  lived in Courts and Camps travelled through many Countries seen many Men under several Climates and of as various Complexions  yet thinks in which every Body will not agree  he speaks of our Impotence to resist the Wiles of Women in very severe Terms  where  Ralegh  has upon the solid Ground of the greatest Examples admonished us to what fatal Inconveniences Mankind is allured by their restless Curiosity of knowing what is unfit for their Knowledge and the prevailing Expedients to gratify it of dissimulate Sorrow and Unquietness  While  Ralegh  was under the Displeasure aforesaid and in Retirement he projected a further Removal from the Court the better by that Distance and some memorable Exploit to allay the Malice of his Enemies and recover his Soveraign's Love Some thought this an impolitick Course as if his foreign Actions could not work so effectually to his Advantage as the Applications of his Adversaries to his Disparagement And hereupon Sir  Robert Naunton  says  That finding his Favour declining and falling into a Recess he undertook a new Peregrination to leave that  Terra infirma  of the Court for that of the Wars and by declining himself and by absence to expel his and the Passion of his Enemies which in Court says he was a strange Device of Recovery but that he knew there was some ill Office done him that he durst not attempt to mind any other Ways than by going aside thereby to teach Envy a new Way of Forgetfulness and not so much as to think of him Howsoever he had it always in Mind never to forget himself and his Device took so well that at his return he came in as Rams do by going backwards with the greater Strength and so continued to the last great in her Grace  Thus also says another Author  His Enemies of greater Rank kept him under sometimes in sometimes out and then he would wisely  decline himself out of the  Courtroad  And then you found him not but by Fame in Voyages to the  WestIndies Guiana New Plantations Virginia  or in some Expeditions against the  Spaniards And thus writes a third to the same Purpose  'Tis observable that Sir  Walter Ralegh  was in and out at Court so often that he was commonly called the  Tennis Ball of Fortune  which she delighted to sport with His Enemies perpetually brought him into Disgrace with his Mistress and his Merit in a little Time restored him again to her Favour And as she always grew cold to the Earl of  Essex  after Absence so she ever received  Ralegh  with greater Marks of her Esteem and he was too hard for his Rivals by the very Means which they intended for his Destruction  Certainly he deserved such good Fortune beyond all others of a Restitution to royal Favour who coul  so much more hazardously and heroically than any of them aspire to earn it as now he abundantly manifested in that grand and gallant Undertaking to discover and conquer the large rich and beautiful Empire of  Guiana  an Enterprize which had baffled the repeated Efforts of some of the ablest and most renowned Captains and Cavaliers in  Spain  for near Years past for in one of their own Authors we may read the Names of many brave Commanders and their Commendations for the Miseries they endured who within that Space had trod this Maze and lost themselves with some some Men apiece in finding out this Country And yet none of all their own Authors have more nobly and liberally celebrated these and other such like Adventurers of the  Spanish  Nation than  Ralegh  himself has done  For  Ralegh  industrious in diving into the Causes of so many Failures having informed himself what ambient Courses the preceding Adventurers had  taken to arrive at the Heart of the Country they sought and which was the shortest Way to make a successful Discovery found that most of the  Spanish  Attempts in these Parts had failed through the Mutinies and Discords which they had fomented among themselves as most of their Conquests in others were much owing to the like Factions among the  Americans  And if  there was not an expert Soldier or Seaman but he consulted as one Author observes upon his Character in general nor a printed or manuscript Discourse but he perused whereby it came to pass there were not exacter Rules or Principles for both Services then he drew  Much more may we believe he now particularly made Use of these Helps and Lights to draw those Rules and Directions by which this Year last mentioned he gave to an old Officer Capt  Whiddon  whose Experience he had before tried for a Voyage to the Country aforesaid And this same Year that Captain also returned from thence with several inducing Confirmations of the Grandeur and Opulency of  Guiana  having learnt the same from some of the grand Casiques or principal Rulers upon the Borders thereof but not without Complaints of some barbarous Treachery from the  Spanish  Governor who had then got some Footing there and after promises of suffering the  Englishmen  to furnish themseves with what Supplies they wanted decoyed several of them to their Destruction  Ralegh  had thus more Spurs than one inciting him to visit these Regions in Person And now this golden Country made such Invitations he chearfully determined in Quest thereof though through an Ocean of Difficulties to wash away the Malice of his Adversaries at Court and render his Character more impenetrable against the little Censures which swarm in that Theatre of Circumvention  to sting and fester superiour Merit With such like Views  Ralegh  very speedily fitted  The Empire of  Guiana  is directly East from  Peru  towards the Sea and lies under the equinoctial Line was then governed by the same Laws and under the same Religion There are many Attestations of the wonderful Riches in these Parts especially the Imperial City which they called  Manoa  where  Francisco Lopez  speaking of the Magnificence of the Emperor's Court says  'That all the Vessels of his House Table and Kitchen were of Gold and Silver that in his Wardrobe were hollow Statues of Gold which seemed Giants and the Figures in Proportion and Bigness of all the Beasts Birds Trees and Herbs that the Earth brings forth and of all the Fishes that the Sea or Waters of his Kingdom breeds Finally there was nothing in his Country whereof he had not the Counterfelt in Gold'  Further that City of  Manoa  was by  Juan Martinez  the first Christian who saw it called  El Dorado  or the  Golden City  upon seeing the  Guianians  there and all about the Borders in their drunken Revels anoint themselves with a glutinous Balsom and powder their naked Bodies over with gold Dust 'till they all glittered from Head to Foot  out a Fleet at a great Expence though the Lord Admiral  Howard  and Sir  Robert Cecyl  were at the further Charge of augmenting it  We may distinguish five Ships under him besides Barges Wherries and other necessary Tenders in his own excellent  Narrative  of this Voyage Whence we understand the Ship himself went in was his own which he does not name but the  Lion's Whelp  which was the Lord Admiral's was commanded by Captain  George Gifford  Captain  Keymis  had the Command of a  Galego  besides a Bark which was committed to Captain  Cross  and another to Captain  Calfield  The whole Number of Men in this Fleet is not mention'd but the select Company of Officers Gentlemen and Soldiers he us'd in his Discoveries exceeded not Thus prepar'd he departed from  Plymouth  on the Sixth of  February  following and made to the  Grand Canaries  and so to  Tenerif  where he waited awhile for the  Lion's Whelp  and for Captain  Amais Preston  But this Captain disappointed him and went upon another Adventure which proved some Disadvantage in the Prosecution of his Discoveries After seven or eight Days not seeing them he proceeded for  Trinidad  with his own Ship and Captain  Cross  's only for the Galego which set out with them linger'd behind on the Coast of  Spain  They reach'd that Isle on the d of  March  and cast Anchor at  Point Curiapan  which the  Spaniards  call'd  Punta de Gallo  situate in eight Degrees or thereabouts In the four or five Days he continued here he came not to the Speech of any  Indian  or  Spaniard  On the Coast he saw a Fire but for fear of the  Spaniards  none of the  Indians  dared to approach him Then  Ralegh  in his Barge coasted close along the Shore and landed in every Cove the better to know the Island while his Ships kept the Channel From hence he remov'd in a few Days up NorthEast to recover that Place the  Spaniards  call  Puerto de los Espannoles  but the Inhabitants  Conquerabia  and as before revictualling his Barge he left the Ships and kept by the Shore that he might better speak with the Inhabitants and observe the Rivers WateringPlaces and Ports in the Island of all which he took Draughts as he passed along which he reduced at last to one general Map At  Parico  he found a Freshwater River and at  Terra de Brea  another Port call'd by the Natives  Piche  great Quantities of very good Oysters growing upon the Branches of certain Trees here so numerous that he travell'd for a dozen Miles together under them which enabled him afterwards to rectify the antient Accounts of this Tree and the fond Conceits of  some Moderns that it was the  Tree of Knowledge  'Tis the  Indian  Fig which he curiously describ'd and how it bears  Oysters  by planting itself into the Sea so that one Stem soon becomes a Grove See  Hist of the World  lib cap sect  In short he coasted three Parts of the Isle of  Trinidad  in the Month he staid there for Captain  Preston  the more exactly to make his Draught thereof aforesaid At  Puerto de los Espannoles  he met with his Ships and found a Company of  Spaniards  keeping Guard at the Descent who in doubt of their own Strength offer'd Signs of Peace He sent Captain  Whiddon  to parley with them whom he afterwards left buried in the Island to his great Grief being a Man says  Ralegh  most honest and valiant From some of the  Spanish  Soldiers whom he found Means to make free of their Tongue by the Help of Wine and from one of the  Indian  Rulers named  Cantyman  he gather'd what Strength the  Spaniards  were of and how far it was to the City they had built under their Governor Don  Antonio de Berreo  Here he found Occasion of staying awhile both to have some Reckoning with  Berreo  for his treacherous Dealings with the  English  under  Whiddon  and to learn also the Strength Riches and Passages to several other Parts of the Country But when  Ralegh  was credidibly inform'd that the  Spanish  Governor had sent for a Recruit of Soldiers and how lamentably the Natives suffer'd under his Cruelties that the very Lords of the Country were made his Slaves that he had put one of them named  Morequito  to Death that several others were then lying in Chains and languishing under the most exquisite Tortures he found sufficient Occasion not only to revenge the Loss of his Countrymen but a good Opportunity to gain the Hearts of the  Indians  by attempting  to rescue them from this Yoke of Tyranny Therefore he boldly set upon the  Corps du Garde  in the Dusk of the Evening and having put them to the Sword advanced with a hundred Men and by Break of Day took their new City call'd  San Joseph  which at the Entreaty of the  Indians  he set on Fire Then were the Natives in Confinement set at Liberty Among them were five  Casiques  or petty Kings in those Parts These all bound together in one Chain almost dead with Famine and wasted with Torments having had their naked Bodies basted or dropp'd over with burning Bacon  Ralegh  also to his great Reputation deliver'd from their Captivity and several Years after when this with  Ralegh  's other noble Acts among these  Indians  was mention'd by some of our  English  Adventurers to  Guiana  it was freshly retain'd and gratefully acknowledg'd by them to his Honour when also one of their bravest Princes who had been in  England  and christen'd  Ragapo  came above a hundred Miles to visit them for the great Love he bore to  Ralegh  manifestly shewing how durably he had engag'd their Affection and Desires for his Return to be their Ruler and Protector But for the Governor who had imprison'd so many of them he was now become a Prisoner himself and  Ralegh  by his courteous Treatment of him reaped the Fruit of that Knowledge and Experience he had gather'd in the many Years he had consum'd with great Sums of Money upon the Discovery of  Guiana  The same Day that  Ralegh  made this Conquest arrived Captain  Gifford  and Captain  Keymis  and in their Ships divers Gentlemen and others which to his little Army was a great Succour and Solace Then proceeding upon his Discovery  Ralegh  first call'd all the Chiefs of the Island together who were Enemies to the  Spaniards  for some of them  Berreo  had brought out of other Countries and planted there to eat out and waste the Natives then by his  Indian  Interpreter whom he carried out of  England  he made them understand  he was the Servant of a Queen who was the  greatest Casique of the North  and a Virgin who had more  Casiqui  under her than there were Trees in that Island That she was an Enemy to the  Castellani  in Regard of their Tyranny and O  ression and having freed all the Coasts of the Northern World from their Servitude had sent him to free them also and withal to defend the Country of  Guiana  from their Invasion and Conquest  Then he shew'd them her Majesty's Picture which they so admir'd and honour'd that it had been easy for him to have made them idolatrous thereof The like and larger Speeches he made in solemn Manner to the rest of the Nations both in his Passage to  Guiana  and to those of the Borders So as in that Part of the World the Queen of  England  's Fame was diffus'd with great Admiration This done  Ralegh  return'd to  Curiapan  and tho' he had learn'd of  Berreo  that  Guiana  was some hundred Miles further than the Accounts he receiv'd of Captain  Whiddon  had represented it he kept the Knowledge thereof from his Company whom he fear'd would have been discourag'd thereby from prosecuting the Discovery When  Ralegh  had further gather'd from  Berreo  the Proceedings of the past Adventurers and his own of all which he gives us a succinct and curious History he told him he was come upon the same Design and was resolved to see  Guiana Berreo  used many Arguments to dissuade him as that he must venture in very light and small Boats to pass so many dangerous Shallows and could not carry Victuals enough above half the Way that none of the Country would  speak with him and if he followed them would burn their Towns besides the Way was long the Winter at hand and the Rivers beginning to swell but above all that the Kings and Lords who bordered upon  Guiana  had decreed that none of them should trade with any Christians for Gold because the same would be their own Overthrow  Ralegh  resolving however to make Trial directed his ViceAdmiral Captain  Gifford  and Captain  Calfield  to turn Eastward against the Mouth of the River  Capuri  and gave them Instructions to anchor at the Edge of the Shoal and upon the best of the Flood to thrust over but they labour'd in vain Nor did the Flood continue so long but the Water fell before they could have passed the Sands Then  Ralegh  sent one  King  Master of the  Lion's Whelp  to try another Branch called the  Amana  if either of the small Ships would enter but when he came to the Mouth he found it as the rest After him went  John Dowglass  who discover'd four goodly Entrances but all shoal'd and shallow in the Bays leading to them In the mean Time  Ralegh  fearing the worst caused his Carpenters to cut down an old Galego Boat to fit her with Banks for Oars and so as she might draw but five Foot in this went  Ralegh  with Gentlemen and Officers to the Number of threescore In the  Lion's Whelp  Boat and Wherry they carried twenty Captain  Calfield  in his Wherry carried ten and a Barge of  Ralegh  's ten more This was all the Means they had having left their Ships at  Curiapan  to carry a hundred Men with Weapons and Provisions for a Month exposed to all the Extremes of the Weather all the Hazards of the Water to lie open to the Air and upon hard Boards by Night in Storms of Rain or under the burning Sun by Day to swell  the wet Cloaths of so many crowded together the Dressing of their Food and that mostly stale Fish in the same Place to be in such a Labyrinth of Rivers in such a remote and unknown Region what Prison could be more loathsome and unhealthy what Prospect more fearful and desolate At first setting out they had twenty Miles of a high Sea to cross in these scanty Boats so that they were driven before the Wind into the Bottom of the Bay of  Guanipa  inhabited by inhuman Cannibals who shot poison'd Arrows And from thence to enter one of the Rivers of which  Dowglass  had brought Tidings After four Days they were past ebbing and flowing and might have wander'd a whole Year about and never been able to extricate themselves in such a general Confluence or Rendezvous of Streams were they now bewilder'd and so resembling one another as not to be distinguish'd but imperceptibly circulating and driving them about into the same Places where they had been before passing between many Islands and Streights whose Borders were so thickly arched and overshadowed with Trees as bounded their Sight to the Breadth of the River and Length of the Avenue while the Gloominess of the Prospect added Horror to the Lonesomeness of the Place At length on the d of  May  they fell into a River which because it had no Name they call'd the  Redcross River  these being the first Christians who ever enter'd the same When they drew into the Creek which led to a Town upon this River their  Indian  Pilot named  Ferdinando  landing was set upon by his Countrymen who hunted him with Dogs whereupon  Ralegh  seiz'd an old Man passing that Way and threaten'd to cut off his Head if he would not procure his Pilot's Liberty But he by his Agility soon  escaped them and swam to  Ralegh▪s  Barge However they kept the old Man and used him kindly assuring themselves of useful Information from a Native so long conversant in those Parts And indeed but for this Accident they had never found their Way forward to the Country they sought nor back to that where their Ships lay the old Man himself being often in the utmost Perplexity which River to take so numerous and intricate they were Those People who dwell in the flooded Lands of this  insular  and broken World or in all the Tracts towards  Guiana  which the eight Branches of the  Orenoque  fashion into Islands are generally called  Tivitivas  but distinguished into two Tribes a hardy and valiant Generation who though they inhabited Houses on the Ground in Summer yet in Winter were forced to reside in the Trees where they built themselves artificial Towns and whose Families were to be seen lodg'd in an Arm or Branch of those aireal or vegetable Tenements for between  May  and  September  those Islands are overflow'd in some Places twenty Foot high by the said grand River of  Orenoque  Departing from this Quarter of the  Tivitivas  which was under the Division or Tribe call'd  Ciawana  he kept passing up the River with the Flood and anchoring in the Ebb yet the third Day of his entering the River aforesaid his Galley run aground and stuck so fast they all thought their Discovery was at an End and that the greatest Number of them must live like Rooks and build their Nests in the Boughs but after emptying her Ballast and much Labour they got her a float at the End of the fourth Day and struck into another River call'd the  Great Amana  spacious and without winding being one of the fairest Branches of the grand  Orenoque  But here the  Flood of the Sea left them and every Man from the highest to the lowest was forced to tug by turns at the Oar for several Days against a rapid Current and in a most sultry Clime for they were now in five Degrees of the  Line  Many goodly Rivulets they pass'd on either Side which  Ralegh  nam'd in his Map and shewed their Rise and Descent When three Days more were passed over his Company began as well to despair at the Length of the Way as to languish through excessive Heat and well might their Courage now their Provision also began to fail yet now had they most need of Strength and Vigour when the Current of the River grew most boisterous and violent against them Here  Ralegh  had a great Task to keep up the Spirits of his disconsolate Companions which could not be done without being ever foremost to endure Labour and the last who gratify'd himself with Refreshment He also strictly commanded his Pilots to promise and End every next Day which honest Deceit he used so often they were forced to assure it would be at every Reach  Thus while he was giving them Hopes of attaining the Land where their Patience should be rewarded with Plenty Providence seems to have rewarded his Trust in her by happily shifting the Scene and presenting the most beautiful Landskip they had ever beheld For here Mountains crowned with Garlands of fruitful Trees invited one Sense and verdant Plains of many Miles extent enamelled with Groups of odorous Flowers regaled another Birds of such Sorts and Colours as they had never seen tempted them to supply themselves by their Fowling Pieces and Fishes of various Kinds by their Nets without which having little or no Bread and less Drink only the thick and troubled Water of the River they had  been in the greatest Extremity Now the old  Ciawanian  they had taken as beforemention'd persuading them he would lead them to a Town up the Branch of a River on the right Hand where they might be supplied with all Conveniencies and return before Night  Ralegh  leaving his Galley took eight Musketiers in his Barge and with  Gifford  and  Calfield  in their Wherries having eight Musketiers more enter'd the Mouth of that River but rowed till Sun set and saw no Sign of the Town even till they were forty Miles distant from the Galley and the Rowers were ready to give up the Ghost They had certainly hang'd this Pilot but that their Necessities were his Security for it was quite dark and they knew not their Way back again but as they proceeded the River grew so narrow and was so overspread with Trees from Side to Side that they were all forc'd with their Swords to cut a Way for their Oars About One aClock after Midnight they discern'd a Light and heard the Barking of Dogs soon after they found the Village and there they were stored with Provisions according to the Promises of the old Pilot In the mean Time the Company in the Galley mann'd out a Boat in Search of them but next Day they return'd and continu'd their Course after they had made this hungry and hazardous Voyage for fourscore Miles in that River which besides other strange Fishes of marvellous Bigness abounded with those ugly Serpents call'd  Crocodiles  whence the People nam'd it the River of  Lagartos Ralegh  had a young Negro attending upon him in his Galley who leaping out to swim in the Mouth of this River was in the Sight of them all instantly devour'd by one of these amphibious Animals Not long after being again in Want of Victuals they took two Canoes laden with excellent  Bread being run ashore by the  Indians  in them call'd  Arwacas  who fled to hide themselves in the Woods fearing through the Prepossessions of the  Spaniards  that  Ralegh  and his Company were  Canibals Ralegh  pursuing them in Hopes of some Intelligence found as he was creeping thro' the Bushes a Refiner's Basket there being in it Quicksilver Saltpetre and divers other Materials for the Trial of Metals and also the Dust of some Ore that had been refin'd but in two other Canoes which escaped them they heard of a good Quantity of Ore and Gold  Ralegh  then landed more Men and offered  l  to any of his Soldiers who should take one of the  Spaniards  whom they thought to have also landed in these last Canoes but they escaped while he was pursuing the former However while he was in Search of the  Spaniards  he found the  Arwacas  hidden in the Woods who had been Pilots for the  Spaniards  of which  Ralegh  kept the chief for his Pilot and carried him to  Guiana  by whom he understood in what Parts the  Spaniards  labour'd for Gold which he divulged to few of his Company knowing both the Season of the Year and other Conveniencies would be wanting to work any Mine himself Therefore he hasted away from this Place his Purpose being at that Time rather to discover what he could of the Country and win over the People to Subjection Besides this Restraint from all Greediness after their Gold there was another Virtue he no less strictly observ'd which highly advanced him in the Esteem of all those  Indians  For whereas the  Spaniards  were wont to satisfy their Lusts without Controul upon their Wives and Daughters  Ralegh  suffer'd not a Man of his so much as to touch any of their Women  I protest says he before the Majesty of the living God that  I neither knew nor believe that any of our Company one or other by Violence or otherwise ever knew any of their Women and yet we saw many Hundreds and had many in our Power and of those very young and excellently favour'd which came among us without Deceit stark naked  And because he found it a very troublesome Work to keep the meaner Sort from pilfering and Spoil when they went to any of the  Indians  Houses  Ralegh  caused his Interpreter at every Place when they departed to enquire after the Losses or Wrongs that had been done and if he found any Thing had been stolen or taken by Violence either the same was restored and the Party punish'd in their Sight or else it was paid for to their utmost Demand  After he was recruited with Bread and other Provisions which greatly encouraged his Men who now cry'd out  Let us go on we care▪ not how far Ralegh  sent back in one of the Canoes the old  Ciawan  and  Ferdinando  his first Pilot giving them such Things as they desir'd for their Voyage and wrote a Letter to his Ships which they deliver'd and then he went on under the Pilotage of one of those  Arwacas  he had taken whom the  Spaniards  had christen'd  Martin  But the next or second Day after they run aground again with their Galley and she was very near being cast away with their new Store of Victuals they lay on the Sand one whole Night and were in far greater Despair of disengaging her than before because they had no Tide of Flood to help them In the Midst of their Fears they bethought them of fastening an Anchor upon the Land and with main Strength drew her off So the fifteenth Day of their Absence from their Ships they discover'd at a Distance to their great Joy the Mountains of  Guiana  and towards the Evening were brought by a northerly  Gale in Sight of the great  Orenoque  which they soon after enter'd a River of vast Extent and Magnitude lying mostly East and West even from the Sea to  Quito  in  Peru  thought to be Miles wide at the Mouth Miles navigable for Ships for lesser Vessels and discharging it self by sixteen Arms into the Sea whereby many Parts of the  Spanish Indies  might most easily be invaded From other Observations it appears in many Places of the Channel to be twenty Fathom deep and in few that are shoally less than two and a half It was called by the succeeding Voyagers to this Place in Honour of Sir  Walter  after his Name One of them gives his Reason for it in these Words  Of the Worthiness of this River because I cannot say enough I will speak nothing we have presumed to call it by the Name of  RALEANA  because your self was the first of our Nation who ever enter'd the same  Now when  Ralegh  had procur'd one of the bordering Princes named  Toparimaca  a skilful old Pilot who was his Brother and who perfectly knew this River he sailed up a Branch thereof having on the left Hand a great Island which they call  Assapana  and thence along the Banks of several other Islands which they chose rather to anchor at than by the main Land because of the Tortoises Eggs found there in Abundance to their great Relief and for the Convenience of casting their Nets from the Rocks of a blue metalline Colour which look'd like Steelore So keeping always westward up the River there open'd after a while a Land on the right Side which appear'd a spacious Champaign and the Banks perfectly red  Ralegh  sent Captain  Giffard Thynn Calfield  his Cousins  Greenvil  and  Batshead Gorges  also his Nephew  John Gilbert  and some others with a Guard of Soldiers to march over the Banks and discover what Prospect it afforded  and finding it a Level of an unbounded Space it proved as their Pilot inform'd them the Plains of  Saima  reaching to  Cumana  and  Caracas  in the  WestIndies  which are a hundred and twenty Leagues to the North and inhabited by four principal Nations whereof one were the  Aroras  as black as Negroes but of smooth Hair a desperate People using the strongest and most deadly Poison of all others on their Arrows  Ralegh  was most curious to know the Composition of this Poison and what Remedies could be had against the dreadful Effects of it For besides the Mortality of the Wound the Patient is afflicted with most insufferable Torment and accompanied with such irksome Symptoms that the Physician cannot abide the Cure None of the  Spaniards  could ever extort this Secret either by Kindness or Cruelty and indeed but few of the  Indians  besides their Priests and Soothsayers knew it  Whether the Poison they used in  Guiana  was the same with that in some other Parts of the  WestIndies Ralegh  has not told us but Sir  John Hawkins  informs us that about  Cumana  where they are very expert Archers  'their Poison is of such Force that a Man being struck therewith dies in twentyfour Hours and that in his Judgment there can be no stronger using thereunto Apples which are fair and red of Colour but are a strong Poison perhaps the  Manchineil  of which with venomous Bats Vipers Adders and other Serpents they make a Medley and anoint their Arrows'  Ralegh  was therefore more beholden to the  Guianians  than any Body for  Antonio de Berrio  told him that he could never attain to the Knowledge thereof  And yet they taught me says  Ralegh  the best Way of healing this as well as all other Poisons  Then he tells us those Medicines which are vulgar and serve for the ordinary Poison are made of the Juice of a Root call'd  Tupara  which also marvellously quenches the Heat of burning Fevers and heals inward  Wounds and that those of common poison'd Arrows were wont to be heal'd by some of the  Spaniards  with the Juice of Garlic But this he communicates as a general Rule for all Men that shall hereafter travel the  Indies  where poison'd Arrows are used that they abstain from Drink for if they take any Liquor into their Body whereunto they will be exceedingly provoked by Drought and drink before the Wound is dress'd or immediately upon it there is no Relief but present Death  After having passed the Mountain  Aio  and a great Island which he mentions he reached on the fifth Day of his entering the great River aforesaid as high as the Province of  Aromaia  and anchoring at the Port of  Morequito  which is Miles within the Land upon the said great River  Orenoque  he sent a Messenger to the old King of  Aromaia  named  Topiowary  who came the next Day before Noon on Foot from his House and returned the same Evening being Miles backwards and forwards though himself was Years of Age He had many Attendants of both Sexes who came also to wonder at the  English  and brought them great Plenty of Flesh Fowl and Fish with divers Sorts of Fruits and among them abundance of  Pinas  the most excellent of all Kinds  Whether  Ralegh  at his Return brought of this Fruit into  England  which is otherwise called the  Ananas  and vulgarly the  P  e Apple  from some Resemblance it bears in Shape to the  Canes  of the  Pine tree  or any of that most delicious Wine made thereof which he there also tasted has rather been suggested than confirmed but afterwards when by a speedy Voyage some of the Fruit was brought over and presented to King  James  in greater Perfection than we can conceive from tasting what is forced out of h  t Beds here he discovered one of the noble Maxims in his King craft by declaring  It was a Fruit too delic  s for a Subject to taste of  especially those of  Guiana  besides Bread  Wine and a Sort of Parroquites no bigger than Wrens And one of them presented  Ralegh  with a little Beast which the  Spaniards  call  Armadilla  having his Body scaled or plated over like the  Rhinoceros  with a white Horn growing in his hinder Parts as big as a hunting Horn This Horn is recommended in Medicine and the Flesh for Food since  Ralegh  soon after made a Feast of it  When the old King had rested himself a while in a Tent which  Ralegh  had caused to be pitched for him they entered by the Interpreter into Discourse about the Murder of  Morequito  his Predecessor and the other Violations of the  Spaniards  Then  Ralegh  acquainted him with the Cause of his coming thither whose Servant he was and that it was his Queen's Pleasure he should undertake this Voyage to deliver them from the Tyranny of the  Spaniards  dilating at large on her Majesty's Power Justice and Clemency towards all oppressed Nations all which being with great Reverence and Attention received he began to sound the old Man touching  Guiana  as what Sort of Commonwealth it was how governed of what Strength and Policy of what Extent with whom in Alliance or Enmity lastly the Distance and Way to enter the Heart of the Country The King gave such ample and perfect Account of these Particulars that  Ralegh  wondered to find a Man of such Gravity Judgment and good Discourse without the Help of Learning or Breeding After his Departure  Ralegh  sailed westward to view the famous River  Caroli  both because it was so wonderful in itself and led to the strongest Nations of all the Frontiers who were Enemies to the  Epuremei  subjects to the  Inga  or Emperor of  Guiana  and  Manoa  Even when he was short of it or lower down than the Port of  Morequito  he heard the  roaring Falls of this River but when he entered it with his Barge and Wherries thinking to have gone up some Miles to the  Cassipagotos  he was not able with a Barge of eight Oars to row one Stone's Throw in an Hour and yet the River is as broad as the  Thames  at  Woolwich  Therefore encamping on the Banks he sent off an  Indian  to acquaint the Nations upon the River of his Arrival and his Purpose and that he desired to see the Lords of  Canuria  who dwelt in that Province Then one of the Princes came down named  Wanuretona  with many of his People and brought great Store of Provisions as the rest had done By him  Ralegh  found the  Carolians  were not only Enemies to the  Spaniards  but most of all to the  Epuremei  who abounded in Gold and that there were three mighty Nations at the Head of that River which would join him against them He was further informed by one Capt  George  whom he had taken with  Berreo  that near the Banks of this River there was a great Silver Mine but the Rivers were all now so risen that it was not possible for the Strength of Man with any Boat to row against the Stream Therefore he dispatched a Party between and to coast the River by Land while himself with two or three Officers and half a dozen Shot marched overland to view the strange and wonderful Overfalls of the said River  Caroli  which roared at such a Distance and the Plains adjoining with the Rest of the Province of  Canuri  When they had got to the Top of the first Hills overlooking the River they beheld that prodigious Breach of Waters which poured down  Caroli  and how it ran in three Streams for Miles together No less than or of these steep Cataracts appeared in Sight each as high above the other as a Churchtower which rushed  down with such Violence that the very Rebound of the Waters made the Place seem as if it had been all over covered with a great Shower of Rain And here  Ralegh  says he never saw a more beautiful Country nor more lively Prospects the Hills so raised up and down about the Valleys the Waters winding into such various Branches the Plains so clear of Bush and Stubble and covered all with fair green Grass the Ground of hard Sand and easy for the March either of Horse or Foot the Deer crossing in every Path the Birds towards the Evening singing on every Tree a thousand several Tunes with Cranes and Herons of white crimson and Carnation pearched along the River Banks the Air refreshed with gentle easterly Breezes and every Stone they stooped to take up promising either Gold or Silver by its Complexion His Company at their return brought several of these Stones home which they rather found coloured outwardly like Gold than any of that Metal fixed in them for those who had least Judgment or Experience kept only such as glittered and would not be persuaded but they were rich because they shone thereby bred an Opinion that all the Rest were no better Yet some of these Stones  Ralegh  shewed afterwards to a  Spaniard  of the  Caraccas  who told him it was  El madre del oro  that is  the Mother of Gold  and that the Mine was further in the Ground  Among the goodly Rivers beyond the  Caroli  there is one name  Caora  Upon this Branch it was attested to  Ralegh  by the most intelligent and credible Chiefs of the adjacent Parts there dwelt a Nation of People whose Heads appear not above their Shoulders which because every Body in the Provinces of  Aromaia  and  Canuri  also affirmed he was inclined to believe They are called  Ewaipanoma  and reported to have their Eyes in their Shoulders and Mouths in their Breasts or in a level with them It was further avouched to him they used Bows Arrows and Clubs thrice as big as any of the  Guianians  and that one being taken Prisoner the Year before was brought into  Aromata  When  Ralegh  doubted of such a Race to the Prince hereaftermentioned who came with him into  England  he answered it was no wonder among them for they had lately slain many Hundreds of his Father's People  Ralegh  observes  That  Mandevill  had before written of such a Nation and that since the  EastIndian  Discoveries we find his Relations true which were before held incredible  Further that when he afterwards arrived at  Cumana  he spoke with a  Spaniard  eminent for his Travels and withal for his Credit and Veracity who hearing that  Ralegh  had been as far in  Guiana  as  Caroli  immediately asked him if he had seen those People and declared he had seen many of them Then  Ralegh  names some  French  Merchants of  London  who were there present and heard what this  Spaniard  had thus asserted  Whether it is true or no says he the Matter is not great neither can there be any Profit in the Imagination for my own Part I saw them not but an resolved that so many People did not all combine or fore think to make the Report  After all whether the Observation of any Garment loosely rising above the Shoulders of these People or the crouching Posture in which they were so much seen by their constant Exercise of Archery might not first give some Rise to this Report I leave for others more largely to explain  Mr  Theobald  thinks we may be able to account in a few Lines for the Mystery of these supposed headless People For  Olearius  speaking says he of the Manner of Cloathing of the  Samojeds  a People of North  Muscovy  says  'Their Garments are made like those called  Cosaques  open only at the Necks When the Cold is extraordinary they put their  Cosaques  over their Heads and let the Sleeves hang down their Faces being not to be seen but at the Cleft which is at the Neck whence some have taken occasion to write that in these  northern  Countries there are People without Heads having their Faces in their Breasts'  Theobald  "s  Shakespear  vo vol    and how far the same Person shall here be condemn'd for an implicit Faith who was as we have read censur'd for the Want of it This Consideration may be further offer'd for what  Ralegh  also repeats not only from the Writers of all Nations concerning the modern  Amazons  in these Parts but from their very Neighbours For having told us that  Orellana  first discover'd  Marannon  which is call'd the River of  Amazons  and also after the said Discoverers own Name  Ralegh  was inquisitive to know whether there were any of those warlike Women from whom this River should be so call'd in these  American  Parts who are so fam'd in antient Histories to have been in  Asia  and  Africa  and was assur'd by an antient  Casique  that there was such a Nation of Women on the South of the said River in the Provinces of  Topago  whose Manners and Customs as they describ'd to him did somewhat conform with what is recorded of the antient  Amazons  As they cohabited with Men but one Month in the Year sent them the male Children and kept only the Females  but that they cut off their Right Breast  says he  I do not find to be true  He was further told they scrupled not to accompany with the Prisoners they took in War at any Time but in the End constantly put them to Death And that as others of the bordering Nations these Women wore certain Plates of Gold which they had sometimes exchang'd  with other Countries for  Spleenstones  which are of a green Colour and whereof says  Ralegh  I saw divers in  Guiana  for every King or  Casique  commonly has one which their Wives chiefly wear and esteem as great Jewels  When  Ralegh  with his Company lay at Anchor on the Coast of  Canuri  and had taken Knowledge of all the Nations upon the Head and Branches of the  Caroli  and found out many Tribes who were Enemies to the  Epuremei  and the new Conquerors having now wander'd for near a Month distant from his Ships above Miles besides the long Digressions up many Arms and Branches on every Side by the Way they found the Winter Season advance apace  "The Winter and Summer here as touching Cold and Heat says  Ralegh  differ not neither do the Trees ever sensibly lose their Leaves but have always Fruit either ripe or green and most of them both Blossoms Leaves ripe Fruit and green at one Time But their Winter consists of terrible Rains and overflowing of the Rivers with many great Storms and Gusts Thunder and Lightnings of which we had our Fill ere we return'd"  and the  Orenoque  threaten them with greater Fury every Day than other the Time they spent at  Trinidad  and the Company they there in vain waited for being both wanted here to compleat their Enterprise For the most violent Storms of Thunder and Lightning which now so frequently broke out pour'd down such Floods of Rain as made all the Rivers rise and rage most fearfully so that if they waded them over Shoes in the Morning outward homeward they could not come even the same Day without wading to their Necks or swimming before they could reach their Boats Besides they all grew very uneasy to themfelves and one another for want of Shifting no Man having Room to bestow any  other Apparel than what he wore on his Back and that was wash'd through to his Skin often ten Times a Day These Inconveniences with those of having no Instruments to try any Mines or Men sufficient to secure them against the guarded Nations nearer the Imperial City of  Manoa  Captain  Preston  having fail'd them made  Ralegh  conclude there was now no advancing thither or staying longer here but that he might well content himself for this Voyage with the various Discoveries of the Situation Products and Riches of the Country which he had thus far made with the Interest and Friendship he had thus spaciously procur'd and which no Adventurer to those Regions ever had in a much larger Space of Time with much greater Aids and Provisions the Diligence and Dexterity to equal  As he return'd to the East he spent some Time in discovering the River towards the Sea which he had not survey'd In a Day's Time he arriv'd again at the Port of  Morequito  for gliding down the Stream he went without Labour tho' against the Wind little less than a hundred Miles a Day When he came to Anchor he was very desirous of some further Conference with old  Topiowari  who soon upon Notice came with a Multitude of his People flocking down to  Ralegh  's Tent upon the Shore every one loaded with Presents When the old King was refresh'd and the Crown retir'd  Ralegh  by his Interpreter enter'd into a long Conference with him telling him that as both the  Epuremei  and the  Spaniards  were his Enemies the one having conquer'd  Guiana  already and the other endeavour'd to get it from both he desir'd to be instructed both in the best Ways to the golden Parts of  Guiana  and the civiliz'd Towns or apparell'd People of  Inga  The King answer'd  he could not perceive  Ralegh  meant to proceed to the great City of  Manoa  because neither the Season of the Year nor the Strength of his Company would enable him for he remember'd that in the Plains of  Maqureguarai  the first civil Town of  Guiana  where all the Gold Plates were made which were scatter'd over the neighbouring Nations and about four Days Journey from his own  Spaniards  were destroy'd who had no Friends among the Borderers therefore advised  Ralegh  never to invade the strong Parts of  Guiana  without the Help of all those Nations which were their Enemies  Ralegh  ask'd if he thought the Company he had with him were sufficient to take that Town The King thought they were and proffer'd to assist him with all his Borderers if he would leave him a Guard of fifty Men upon his Departure but  Ralegh  knowing if they should escape the  Guanians  the  Spaniards  expecting Supplies would repay upon them this Treatment at  Trinidad  very plausibly excus'd himself Hereupon the King desir'd he would forbear him and his Country at this Time for if the  Epuremei  should know he had given  Ralegh  any Aid or Intelligence he should soon be overrun by them nor could he avoid the  Spaniards  if they should return who had before led him Days in a Chain like a Dog till he paid Plates of Gold and several Chains of Spleenstones for his Ransom but if  Ralegh  would return in due Season next Year he would engage all the Borderers in the Enterprise for that he could not more desire to make himself Master of  Guiana  than they to assist him having been plunder'd by the  Epuremei  of their Women whom to recover they would willingly renew the War without Hopes of further Profit for the old King complain'd of it as a Matter of grievous Restraint  that now they were confin'd to three or four Wives a piece who were wont to enjoy ten or a dozen while the Lords of their Enemies had no less than or But they seem to have had a political Reason for this Recovery to strengthen their Alliance and encrease their Forces these Frontiers having been much depopulated between the Subjects of  Inga  and the  Spaniards Ralegh  finding it absolutely improper either to leave any of his Company or attempt War upon the  Epuremei  till the next Year apply'd himself now only to learn how these People wrought those Plates of Gold which were dispers'd about and how they divided it from the Stone The King told him that most of their Plates and Images were not sever'd from the Stone but that on the Lake of  Manoa  and many other Rivers thereabouts they gather'd the perfect Grains of Gold and mingling a Proportion of Copper the better to work it put it in a great earthen Pot under which they encreas'd the Fire by the Breath of Men through long Canes fasten'd to the Holes round the said Pot till the Metal dissolv'd which then they cast into Moulds of Stone and Clay and so made those Plates and Images whereof  Ralegh  brought two Sorts into  England  more to shew the Manner of them than their Value For he gave more Pieces of Gold of the twenty Shilling Coin with the Queen's Effigies upon them among these People to wear in Honour of her Majesty and to engage them in her Service than he receiv'd so little did he make his Desire of Gold known to them He also brought over some Gold Ore of their Mines  whereof I know some is as rich  says he  as any the Earth yields and of which I know there is sufficient if nothing else were to be hop'd for  but they wanted Time Hands and Instruments to break the Ground without which there could be  no working of Mines  We saw  adds he  all the Hills with Stones of the Colour of Gold and Silver and we try'd them to be no  Marquesite  and therefore such as the  Spaniards  call  El madre del oro  or the Mother of Gold which is an undoubted Assurance of the general Abundance thereof and myself saw the outside of many Mines of the  Sparre  which I know to be the same that all covet in this World and of those more than I will speak of  Now  Ralegh  besides having learn'd the Riches of the Country having also won the Affections of the People and receiv'd a faithful Promise of the Chiefs in those Provinces of  Aromaia  and  Canuri  to become Servants to her Majesty took his Leave of old  Topiowari  and receiv'd his Son Prince  Cayworaco  as a Pledge betwixt them whom he brought into  England  where he was christen'd  Gualtero  with great Solemnity leaving with the old King two of his own People in Exchange the one named  Francis Sparrow  who being a good Draughtsman and could describe a Country with his Pen desir'd to be left for that Purpose whom  Ralegh  instructed to travel as far as he could to  Manoa  with such Merchandise as he committed to his Care the other was a Boy who waited upon him named  Hugh Goodwin  for whom he left Orders to be taught the Language of the Country This done he weigh'd Anchor and coasted the River on  Guiana  side because he came towards it on the Northside by the Lawns of  Saima  There was a powerful Casique named  Putijma  who accompanied  Ralegh  and his Men from  Aromaia  with Promises to lead them to a Mountain call'd  Iconuri  which contain'd a Mine of Gold and which says  Ralegh  he perform'd  Ralegh  travell'd a great Way towards it himself along the River  Mana  till through Weariness he was  forced with some of his Attendants to rest on the Banks of a Lake in the delightful Valley of  Oiana  where one of his Guides kindling a Fire with two Sticks  Succeeding Voyagers have observ'd of the  Karaguata Guacu  a  Brasilian  Free about or Foot high with yellow Flowers on the Top and large long thick Leaves which yield an unctuous Liquor serving for Soap and Strings for FishingNets that with the Wood thereof and of another call'd  Imbaiba  the Inhabitants kindle their Fires by striking them together as we by a Flint and Steel  they stay'd a while to dry their Shirts sending Captain  Keymis  the while with a Party under that  Casique  to take Cognizance of the said Mine and promis'd to meet him at the River  Cumaca  in his Way to  Emeria  the Province of  Carapara  one of the greatest Lords of the  Orenoqueponi  with whom he sought to establish a League And as  Ralegh  return'd by the River  Mana  towards the said Province he saw himself many Rocks like Gold Ore and on the Left Hand a round Mountain of Mineral Stone From hence returning down the Stream he coasted the Province of  Parino  but the Branches of the Rivers he here passed with  Aio  and other Mountains he reserv'd to the Representation in his Map which for the numerous and distant Rivers and Countries therein occasionally refer'd to appears to have been a very accurate and comprehensive Performance  In the River of  Winciapora  he saw what they call the Mountain of Crystal which look'd at a Distance like a white Churchtower of exceeding Height over the Top of which a mighty River rush'd down with prodigious Noise  Berreo  told him there were Diamonds and other Stones of great Value thereon which blaz'd at a great Distance Upon this River  Ralegh  rested a while and marched to a Town of the same Name where he  found the Natives all as drunk as Beggars it being the Time of their Festival Here  Ralegh  refresh'd himself with the Provisions of the Place and the delicate Wine of  Pinas  But understanding that  Carapana  was retir'd from  Emeria  and imagining because he was an old subtil Prince it was to wait till he should return next Year then join him if the  English  were strong enough to tempt his Alliance if not that he might excuse his Retirement to the  Spaniards  as tho' it were in Fear of these new Visitors  Ralegh  spent no more Time in seeking after him but making to the River  Cumaca  he met with  Keymis  and took his Leave of  Putijma  who of all others most lamented his Departure for the  Orenoque  was now swoln most dreadfully so that it was impossible to return by the Way he entered for the River of  Amana  could not be sailed back by any Means the Breeze and Current of the Sea were so outragious therefore he follow'd the Branch of  Capuri  which enter'd into the Sea Eastward of his Ships that he might bear with them before the Wind and great Need there was so to do having by that Way as much to cross of the main Sea in their little Boats after they came to the River's Mouth as between  Gravelin  and  Dover  But when they arrived at the Seaside and anchor'd in the Mouth of  Capuri  there arose a mighty Storm and the River's Mouth was at least a League broad so that they run before Night close under the Land with their Boats and brought the Galley as near as they could which had much ado to live and was often near sinking with all her Men  Ralegh  was in the utmost Doubt what Course to take either to venture in the Galley through six Foot Water on the Sands for two Leagues together and that in the Channel when she drew five or trust in such a raging Wind and Sea to cross over in his  Barge At last seeing the Tempest increase the longer he tarried he took  Gifford Calfield  and  Greenvil  in his Barge and about Midnight thrust into the Sea leaving the Galley to come by Daylight  Thus faintly chearing one another in Shew of Courage says  Ralegh  it pleased God by Nine aClock the next Morning we discover'd the Isle of  Trinidad So they kept along the Shore to  Curiapan  where they found their Ships at Anchor  than which says he there never was to us a more joyful Sight  especially when they found upon meeting together they had lost but one Man before mention'd through so many Extremes of Wet Heat Hunger Want of Rest Sleep Lodging and such like violent Hardships in this toilsome and dangerous Adventure as drove them to many unusual and unhealthy Shifts especially in their Diet such as feeding upon many strange and corrupted Fruits▪ upon fresh Fish without seasoning  Crocodiles Seacows  Of these Seamonsters otherwise call'd  Manati  by the  Spaniards Ralegh  says he had seen as big as a Winepipe others describe its Flesh to be like Beef and to yield and excellent Oil the Hide being dress'd makes good Buff and dried good Targets or Armour wherefore we are told Sir  Walter Ralegh  brought several of these Hides into  England  Antas  and  armed Hogs  upon all Sorts of the Land or Water good and bad without Order or Measure and yet no  Calenture  befel them or other pestilent Diseases which are wont to infect all Regions so near the  Line  so wholesome was the Country or so happily suited to their Constitutions  In his Return homewards he touch'd at  Cumana  to store and refresh himself with such Provisions as he wanted but the  Spaniards  refused to supply him at which he threatned the Town and upon their refusing also to save it by such reasonable  Ransom as they had just before offer'd Captain  Preston  he set it on Fire the like he did at  St Mary  and at  Rio de la Hach  as we are informed by  Camden  and others some of whom affirm he got not only great Glory hereby but Riches the latter of which will be thought doubtful to those who have read the  Spaniards  had removed their Effects to the Mountains before they entered into a Capitulation with  Preston  On the th of  July  when the said Captain  Preston  with the rest of his Company were under  Cape St Anthony  the westermost Part of the Isle of  Cuba we met says the Writer of his Voyage with the honourable Knight Sir  Walter Ralegh  returning from  his painful and happy Discovery of  Guiana and his Surprise of the Isle of  Trinidad  so with glad Hearts we kept him and his Fleet of three Ships Company for he mentions no more till the twentieth Day at Night at which Time we lost them  When  Ralegh  was arrived in  England  he soon applied himself to digest the Observations he had made in his Discoveries and they were not many Months after committed to the Press Several Authors have bestowed Characters in Praise of this  Discourse  which manifests such a wonderful Genius in compassing the Knowledge of so many Places Productions and People with so small a Power and in so short a Time  But  Ralegh  with all his Zeal and Assiduity for the Honour and Advantage of his Country could never induce the State to proceed in the Plantation of  Guiana  not so much through any real Incredulity of the Emoluments that would accrue from it as through that malignant Jealousy which so eternally biass'd the domestic Competitors for Royal Favour to curb the foreign Services of enterprising Men lest the Atchievments of the one  should outshine the Administrations of the other whence we may here observe that he whose engaging Qualities had gain'd him such Influence such an Ascendency over the most savage and unciviliz'd Nations found no Dispositions so barbarous and intractable among those Strangers as he did in his own Country like  Hercules  himself who having by his glorious Labours shewed his Power of subduing and taming all other Monsters found Envy and Detraction invincible at last That  Ralegh  's Labours were attended with the same Fate himself has sufficiently discover'd in that  Dedication  which with so much Eloquence Modesty and Generosity he made of his  Discourse  upon  Guiana  aforesaid to the Lordadmiral  Howard  and Sir  Robert Cecyl  For notwithstanding the Difficulties and Dangers of the Voyage  it appears says  Ralegh  therein that I made no other Bravado of going to Sea than was meant and that I was never hidden in  Cornwal  or elsewhere as was suppos'd They have grosly belied me that fore judged I would rather become a Servant to the  Spanish  King than return and the rest were much mistaken who would have persuaded that I was too easeful and sensual to undertake a Journey of so great Travel but as he generously continues if what I have done receive the gracious Construction of a painful Pilgrimage and purchase the least Remission I shall think all too little and that there were wanting to the rest many Miseries  But  Ralegh  was in Hopes it would appear there was now a Way found out to answer every Man's longing a richer  Indies  than any the King of  Spain  enjoyed which if the Queen would patronize he was willing to end the Remainder of his Days in reducing it to a total Subjection Whatever he further advanced of this Kind Diffidence and Detraction  were so predominant that because some of  Ralegh  's Company brought over  Marcasite  for Gold as he informs us a little further there were some who woud not believe the real Goldore which he brought and which he had helped to dig out of the Rocks with his own Dagger was of greater Value Nay when many Trials had been made of this Ore wherein some Quantities were proved by one  Westwood  a Refiner in  Woodstreet  to hold after the Rate of twelve or thirteen thousand Pounds a Ton Other Parcels by Mr  Bulman  and  Dimock  Assaymaster found also to hold after the Rate of twentythree thousand Pounds the Ton and a third Sort tried by Mr  Palmer  Comptroller of the  Mint  and Mr  Dimock  in  Goldsmith  's  Hall  holding after the Rate of twentysix thousand nine hundred Pounds the Ton who tried also some Golddust of the same Mine which held eight Pound six Ounces weight of Gold in the Hundred and an Image of Copper made in  Guiana  which held a third Part of Gold when all this was prov'd there were those who would not yet believe it Gold of  Guiana  but that  Ralegh  purchas'd it upon the  African  Coast and caried it over thither  Surely the Singularity of that Device says  Ralegh  I do not well comprehend For my own Part I am not so much in love with these long Voyages as to devise thereby to cousen myself to lie hard to fare worse to be subject to Perils to Diseases to ill Savours to be parch'd and wither'd and withal to sustain the Care and Labour of such an Enterprise except the same had more Comfort than the fetching of  Marcasite  in  Guiana  or buying of Goldore in  Barbary  But I hope the better Sort will judge me by themselves and that the Way of Deceit is not the Way of Honour or good Opinion I have herein consumed much Time and many Crowns and I had no other Respect or Desire  than to serve her Majesty and my Country thereby If the  Spanish  Nation had been of the like Belief with these Detractors we should little have fear'd or doubted their Attempts wherewith we now are daily threaten'd  But if we now consider of the Actions both of  Charles V  who had the Maidenhead of  Peru  and the abundant Treasures of  Atabalipa  together with the Affairs of the  Spanish  King now living what he has added to the Acts of his Predecessors how many Kingdoms he has endangered how many Armies Garrisons and Navies he maintains the great Losses he has repaired as in  EightyEight  above    Sail of great Ships with their Artillery and that no Year is less unfortunate but that many Vessels Treasures and People are devoured and yet that he begins again like a Storm to threaten Shipwreck to us all we shall find that these Abilities arise not from the Trades of  Sack  and  Sevilleoranges  nor from ought else that either  Spain Portugal  or any of his other Provinces produce it is his  Indian  Gold that endangers and disturbs all the Nations of  Europe  it creeps into Councils purchases Intelligence and sets bound Loyalty at Liberty in the greatest Monarchies thereof if the  Spanish  King can keep us from foreign Enterprizes and from the Impeachment of his Trades either by Offer of Invasion or by besieging us in  Britain Ireland  or elsewhere he has then brought the Work of our Peril in great Forwardness for those Princes who abound in Treasure have great Advantages over the rest if they once constrain them to a  defensive  War where they are driven once a Year or oftener to cast Lots for their own Garments  For these and other substantial Reasons which  Ralegh  produces he declares he has laboured all his Life in the Promotion of those Attempts which promis'd either an Enlargement of our own national Interest  or an Abatement of the encroaching Greatness of the  Spaniard  who in his Judgment is not to be more easily reduc'd than by  such a War  from so many weak Nations are his Treasures gather'd and so far separated from mutual Succour But because he thought such Resolution and Preparations were not to be hoped for in Haste he doubted not if her Majesty would embrace the Offer of those Provinces and that Empire now by him discovered before they were engross'd by the Enemy but it would yield greater Quantities of Treasure than all the King of  Spain  possesses from the  Indies  both  East  and  West  and he would be contented to lose her good Opinion for ever and his Life withal if the Country should not be found to exceed whatever had been promis'd in his Discourse of it Tho' he has therein written he doubts not after the first or second Year that the same should be coloniz'd but to see in  London  a Contractationhouse of more Receipt for  Guiana  than that in  Seville  for the  WestIndies  And is positive  That if there was but a small Army afoot in  Guiana  marching towards  Manoa  the chief City of  Inga  he would yield to her Majesty by Composition so many hundred thousand Pounds yearly as should both defend us from all Enemies abroad and defray all Expences at home and that he would besides pay a Garrison of    or    Soldiers very royally to defend him against other Nations for he cannot but know how his Predecessors were beaten out by the  Spaniards  and that they have ever since with the greatest Cruelties sought the Entry of his Country wherefore he would doubtless be brought to Tribute if not having neither Shot nor Iron weapon in his Empire he might easily be conquer'd  And in another Part of the said Discourse he has these Words  If it be my Lot to prosecute the same I will willingly spend my Life therein and if  any else shall be enabled thereto and conquer the same I assure him thus much he shall perform more than ever was done in  Mexico  by  Cortez  or in  Peru  by  Pisarro  whereof one conquer'd the Empire of  Mutezuma  the other of  Guascar  and  Atabalipa  and whatsoever Prince shall possess it that Prince shall be Lord of more Gold and of more beautiful Empire and of more Cities and People than either the King of  Spain  or the Grand Turk  Concluding his whole Treatise of  Guiana  with  his Trust in him who is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords to put it into her Heart who is the Lady of Ladies to possess it if not I will judge those Men worthy to be Kings thereof  says he  who by her Grace and Leave will undertake it of themselves  All this would not do to raise the saternine Genius of the State to pursue this Action and upon this Occasion we might observe as  Ralegh  did afterwards upon another from a Poet of his own Time That  some great Men cloathing their private Envy in the fair Colours of the publick Good curbed the most needful and noble Undertakings with Distrust through a specious Care for the Service of the State  Among these sage and sceptical Politicians we may discern Sir  Robert Cecyl  to be one who in his Conferences with some of the speculative Geographers of his Time would shew how careful he was not to be overtaken with any partial Affection to the planting of  Guiana  as we are told by one of them whom he would consult about the Matter Nevertheless  Ralegh  's Advice was not wholly disregarded For that part of it proposing to drive the  Spaniards  to a defensive War but upon their own proper Coasts and Harbours was approv'd of and  Ralegh  himself chosen with other Commanders to put it in Execution In the latter End of  January  following he fitted out Capt  Keymis  with a Couple of Ships the  Darling  and  Discoverer  but provided rather to continue the Correspondence and peaceful Traffick with the  Indians  than to strengthen them in a warlike manner with Forces and Accoutrements which was what they most desired and expected When  Keymis  arriv'd at  Guiana  he found his Friends much dispersed but yet enquiring what was become of Sir  Walter Ralegh  whom they had been prepar'd some Months to join were mighty joyful to hear he was not slain at  Cumana  as the  Spaniards  now much encreas'd among them had attested but sadly disappointed that he had not sent a larger Fleet to expel them and conquer their neighbouring Enemies up to the Imperial City  Keymis  further learnt that  Berreo  being left at  Cumana  and lodged in the House of one  Fashardo  the Governors of the  Carraccas  and  Margarita  conspiring together had sent into  Spain  to inform King  Philip  that  Berreo  being retired to spend the Remainder of his declining Days in Privacy and Ease was utterly unable to pursue the Enterprize yet of what Importance his Majesty's Regard thereto was since so eminent an  English  Cavalier as Sir  Walter Ralegh  had by a vigorous Progress and most artful Address made such Conquests and Discoveries in some Parts and render'd himself so extensively engaging in all wherever he came that unless they had Power given them to undertake the Charge all their past Endeavours and future Hopes in those Parts would come to nothing But  Berreo  's CampMaster having been long before sent into  Spain  with Gold enough gotten out of  Guiana  to levy and furnish Men so effectually sollicited  Berreo  's Cause that present Order was given for the victualling and manning of ten Ships to be sent to him so well worth his Care  did the King of  Spain  think this Undertaking And further this Gold bore such Weight that the King commanded eighteen Ships more to stop at  Trinidad  and not follow their other Directions before they saw that Place secur'd from Enemies But  Berreo  himself suspecting that speedy Dispatch return'd to  Carapana  's Port with fifteen Men the scatter'd Remant that  Ralegh  had left him Those Governors follow'd him and anticipating the Authority they promis'd themselves from  Spain  enter'd  Guiana  with their Men and determin'd to murder  Berreo  who fled towards  Caroli  expecting his Son  Antonio de Ximenes  with Succours from the new Kingdom of  Granada  And now  Topiowary  who had fled to the Mountains being dead where the  English  Boy  Ralegh  left was devour'd by a Tyger  Sanjago  a  Spaniard  in the Faction of the Governors aforesaid took  Francis Sparrow  Prisoner who was also left by  Ralegh  but having gather'd great Plenty of Gold he ransom'd his Life therewith yet was kept in Captivity by the  Spaniards  some Years as we may hereafter learn After this the Faction return'd to  Trinidad  and begun to rebuild their Town where unhappily to these new lawless Rulers the twentyeight Sail of Ships arriv'd from  Spain  in  February  following and took  Sanjago  Prisoner whom  Keymis  found in Chains expecting to be put to Death The other Actors in this Interlude vanishing in Canoes recover'd  Margarita  and  Cumana  again When eighteen of those Ships had left all things in good Order they departed according to their Instructions leaving the other ten to sortify at  Conquerabia  for the Reception of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Fleet Nor was it above four Months after the Arrival of those Ships from  Spain  that the King had prepared several others it being in  June  to transport a new  Supply of whole Families to the Number of Persons for  Guiana  When  Keymis  was advanced to  Topiowary  's Port he found the  Spaniards  under  Berreo  had planted a Village there and that a rocky Island against the Mouth of  Caroli  was their Fort or Refuge but now leaving both Town and Island they gathered at the Mouth of that River and had sent for Cannon to defend the Passage  to those Mines says  Keymis  to  Ralegh  from whence your Ore and white Stones were taken the last Year  adding  We all not without Grief to see ourselves thus defeated and our hungry Hopes made void were witnesses of this their Remove  Then  Keymis  resolved to seek out  Putijma  who with some Friends was retired to the high Lands not far from the Mountain  Aio  intending if the  Indians  should think themselves too weak with his Help to displant the  Spaniards  to set some of them to work for Hatchets and Knives to return him Grains of Gold and white Stones from such Places as they should be directed to But when he came to the Place of their Abode they were fled apprehending him and his Company perhaps to have been a Party of  Spaniards Here as  Keymis  goes on  Gilbert  my Pilot offered to bring us either to the Mine of white Stones near  Winicapora  or else to a gold Mine which  Putiima  had shewed him being but one Day's Journey overland from the Place where we now staid at Anchor I saw far off the Mountains adjoining to this gold Mine and having measured their Paths near the same Place this last Year could not judge it to be    Miles from us I do well remember how coming that Way with  Putiima  the Year before he pointed to this same Mountain making Signs to have me go with him thither I understood his Signs and marked the Place but mistook his Meaning imagining that he would have shewed  me the Overfall of the River  Curwari  from the Mountains My  Indian  shewed me in what Sort without digging they gather the Gold in the Sand of a small River named  Macawini  which springs and falls from the Rocks where this Mine is And further told me that he was with  Putiima  when  Morequito  was to be executed by the  Spaniards  and that then the chief of  Morequito  's Friends were in Consultation to shew this Mine unto them if it might redeem their Captain's Life but upon better Advice supposing them in this Case to be implacable and that this might prove a Means to lose not only their King but their Country they have to this Day concealed it from them being of all others the richest and most plentiful  And a little further among the Reasons he gives for his not bringing Proofs away from this Mountain of his having known the Contents of it this is one  Forethinking withal that there being no means but ourselves to make known our Discovery if we returned not in our Misfortune the Hope of following this Voyage would be buried  And further still he says  I could promise Hope of gold Mines and certain Assurances of Pieces of made Gold of Spleen stones Kidneystones and others of better Estimate But because our Belief seems to be matted in these greater Matters and a Certainty of smaller Profits is the readiest Inducement to quicken our weak Hopes I go not so far says he as my own Eyes might warrant me  These Testimonies and others which may be produced  Francis Sparrow  above mentioned in the Body of the Work confirms this Account of the Mines in these Words  'Within six Weeks after I departed out of the River  Orenoque  I came to the rich Country of  Curaa  in  Guiana  where are the Mines of white Stone in which is much natural and fine Gold which the  Indians  call  Callicurii  The Gold in this Place runs between the Stones like Veins of which Gold I had some Store but now the  Spaniard  is the better for it In  Curaa  is also Gold in small Grains which lie in the Sands in the little Rivers or Brooks I always took those Grains for the finest Gold In these Rivers where Gold lieth are many Aligators or Crocodiles'    will both shew that  Ralegh  was not more Sanguine in his golden Hopes and Promises than the Experience of other Men as well as his own would justify  When  Keymis  was arrived at the Port of  Carapana  this Casique sent some of his People in  Canoes  to assure him he would come down next Day and have a Conference with him but not coming in five or six Days he at last sent one of his aged Attendants to excuse the Fatigue of such a Journey so unfavourable were the Ways and himself so disabled with Years and Infirmities This old Envoy then enlarged upon the Inconveniencies they felt in using the  Spaniards  Assistance against their Enemies especially when he compared their Conduct with that of the Queen of  England  's Subjects under her great Commander  For said he the last Year we doubted not but that he being able would have persecuted us as the Supporters of your Adversaries would have taken our Towns and have made us ransome our Wives and Children But we found it far otherwise and that none of your wellgoverned Company durst offer us any Wrong no not when undiscovered they might have done it We then believed to be true what your grand Captain reported of his Princess took this for a good Proof of her royal Authority and Wisdom that had framed her Subjects to such Obedience and of your Happiness who enjoyed the Benefit thereof Wherefore  Carapana  weighing the friendly Course of these Proceedings doth humbly  rave of her Majesty for himself and his People that with the Rest of the  Indians  who wholly depend on her princely Regard he also may enjoy her favourable  Protection not as a Man forsaken by the  Spaniards  but one that knowing their Injustice hates their Cruelties and takes it for the best Course utterly to disclaim their Friendship  Here  Keymis  breaks off to consider it as a Matter worthy of Observation how this Precedent of  Ralegh  's Moderation and good Order which among them his Countrymen who knew him was but his customary Comportment or ordinary Practice therefore of small Regard with them had yet both alienated the  Indians  Hearts altogether from the  Spaniard  and stirred up in them true Love and Admiration thereof After this he discloses his further Knowledge of the  Indian  Wealth aforesaid in these Words  This old Man shewed whence most of their Gold cometh which is formed in so many Fashions whence their Spleenstones and others of all Sorts are to be had in Plenty where Gold is to be gathered in the Sands of their Rivers from what Part the  Spaniards  both by Trade and otherwise have returned much Gold  and doubts not but all this was divulged with the Consent of  Carapana  as an Invitation to the further Aid and Protection he expected from the  English  Accordingly  Keymis  finding it was in vain to hope for a Conference with that wellwishing but wary  Casique  and having sent him a Present of Iron gave Assurance to all the  Indians  who repaired to him of his speedy Return with Succours promising to make them all rich in Hatchets Knives  These Instruments were such preferable Commodities among some of those  Indians  that  Francis Sparrow  in his Description of  Guiana  beforementioned tells us he bought at  Camalaha  to the South of the  Orenoque  eight young Women the eldest whereof was not Years of Age for one redhafted Knife which in  England  cost him one Halfpenny  and Beads if they would only reserve  good Store of their  Cassavi  which they used for Bread and some Plates of Gold for Exchange And having further spent some Time in the Discovery of above several Rivers Tribes or Nations of People Towns and Casiques in this Voyage he directed his Course homewards and arrived at  Portland  in the latter End of  June  aforesaid having spent five Months in going staying and returning As soon as he got Home he found  Ralegh  had been gone upon a grand Expedition out of the Nation near a Month Therefore he had Time to draw up his Account of this Voyage whence the Passages which more immediately relate to our Subject are extracted ready to present him with at his Return into  England  which he did and dedicated it  To the approved right valorous and worthy Knight Sir  Walter Ralegh  Lordwarden  c  When  Keymis  return'd into  England Ralegh  was gone upon that Enterprize which proved the most renowned of any the  English  undertook in those Days against the  Spaniards  For the Queen having heard they had received Encouragement from  TirOen  the  Irish  Rebel to threaten her with a new Invasion that because she had strengthened their Enemies they would take the shortest Course and begin with  England  Therefore had made great Naval Preparations to which they might not be a little embolden'd both by the Death of her two brave old Commanders  Drake  and  Hawkins  and again by their late Success no further from her own Coasts than  Calais  which taking by Storm under Cardinal  Albert  ArchDuke of  Austria  and Governor of the  Netherlands  the Thunder of the  Spanish  Artillery alarmed her Majesty's Ears in her Palace at  Greenwich  This Posture of Affairs made the Queen determine to use the most effectual Means for preventing the  Mischiefs of an Assault by taking the Start of them and sending a Force sufficient to destroy the  Spanish  Shipping in their own Harbours Accordingly a powerful Fleet was fitted out to the Number of Sail according to  Camden  from  Stow  and  Speed  from both But in the old Manuscript List of this Fleet which  Camden  followed as to the Number of Men it appears there were no more than Ships of the  English  Navy which were afterwards join'd by Sail of  Hollanders  as I gather out of  Grotius  and their other Historians This  English  Fleet contain'd about Men wereof were Voluntiers Now if to this Number of Men we add also that in the  Dutch  Ships which according to their own Computation was near Men there might be enough to leave the whole Fleet furnish'd with sufficient Hands to guard and work it and allow of Men to land upon the  Spanish  Coast  The Lord Admiral  Howard  and the Earl of  Essex  were joined in Commission Generals of this Enterprize but the Queen considering what there might be wanting to keep an old Head and a young one a cool and a warm one in due Temper and Harmony allotted them a Council of War in these Words  For the better and more orderly Execution of this your Commission and of those former Articles comprised in these our Instructions we do ordain that there shall be two Persons serving for the Seas and two that are appointed to serve for Land Service to be as Counsellors to you in our Name that is the Lord  Thomas Howard  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  Sir  Francis Vere  and Sir  Coniers Clifford  and to these four we do add Sir  George Carew  Lieutenant of our Ordnance to make the Number of five whom also we charge by these Presents that they will as they will answer before God give their Councils to  you both without any private Respect to either of you for Love or Fear in all Actions to be put in Question or taken in hand and the same deliberately to debate as the Weight of the Matter shall require before any Resolution be made and before the putting of the Matter in Action  There is further to be understood by those  two Persons serving for the Seas  that the Lord  Thomas Howard  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  were also constituted Admirals in this Expedition Hence was the whole  English  Fleet divided into four Squadrons and so it appears in the List aforesaid wherein we find that which was commanded by  Ralegh  consisted of Ships Mariners and Soldiers The  Dutch  Squadron was commanded by the Admiral of  Holland  named  John Duvenvord  Lord of  Warmondt  How  Essex  relish'd the Division of Authority may be somewhat guess'd at by the Queen's Answer to one of his Letters it seems which she thought very strange  You mention says she first a Danger to commit Authority to any other because you are referr'd to your Commission and Instructions formerly sent you which hath no Power of Deputation as who should say that if you did follow the Directions of our  Hand  our great  Seal  in this Matter should be brought to dispute the Validity of your Warrant  A little further it appears that he had been impatient to be gone for fear he should be detain'd for the Queen had persuaded him to stay behind but not prevailing she at length told him  Though we meant to drive it to the last Considerations and utmost Debates as much as could be yet we compared Times so sufficiently as a Prince who knows what belongs to such a Matter that nothing should be done to retard you being ready one Hour For as we know  Ralegh  not to be arriv'd so we know after it some Time to embark such an Army must be required  But  Ralegh  joined the Fleet and the whole Army was embark'd within ten Days after the Writing of this Letter for on the st of  June  before mentioned the Fleet set Sail from  Plymouth  When they came to the North Cape of  Spain  they called a select Council by hanging out the Flag of Arms and then had the Master and Captain of every Ship his sealed Instructions given him or Letters of Rendezvous which were not to be open'd till they were past  Cape St Vincent  unless separated by bad Weather but to be thrown overboard in Case of Danger from the Enemy and by which it appear'd the Voyage was determin'd for  Cadiz  They had a fortunate Progress both as to the Wind and the taking of every Ship which could give the Enemy Intelligence of their Approach On the th of  June  the Fleet came to Anchor in the Bay of St  Sebastians  short of  Cadiz  half a League The LordAdmiral being careful of her Majesty Ships had resolved with the Earl of  Essex  that the Town should be first attempted to the End that both the  Spanish  Galleons and Galleys together with the Forts of  Cadiz  might not all at once beat upon the  English  Navy  Ralegh  was not present at this Resolution as himself has declar'd in that Account of this Action which he dispatched soon after it was over to a Minister of State in  England  which being the clearest I have met with and easiest to be confirmed not only by the more indifferent Pens of Foreigners but the most partial ones of our own Country those of his Competitors themselves for Honour in this Engagement will here be our best Guide Hence therefore we learn the Reason of  Ralegh  's Aosence at that Resolution of first landing the Army to have been because he was engaged the Day before outward on the Seas in stopping such  Spanish  Ships as might pass out from  St Lucar  or  Cadiz  along the Coast When he return'd two Hours after the rest he found the Earl of  Essex  disembarking his Soldiers having put many Companies into Boats with Intention to make his Descent on the westSide of  Cadiz  but the Bilbows were so raging that the Boats were ready to sink at the Stern of the Earl and divers were lost with some armed Soldiers in them but because this Course had been resolved on and that doubting now in the Danger might look like dreading of it the Earl continued his Purpose of landing when  Ralegh  came aboard his Ship and in the Presence of all the Colonels protested against the Resolution giving him many Reasons and apparent Demonstrations that to the utter Overthrow of their Armies themselves and her Majesty's future Safety he was running the Way of a general Ruin The Earl excused himself and laid it upon the LordAdmiral who would not consent he said to enter with the Fleet till the Town was first possessed All the Commanders and Gentlemen present besought  Ralegh  to dissuade the Attempt for they all perceived the Danger and were convinced that the greatest Part must perish ere they could set Foot on Ground and if any reached the Shore yet would they surely have their Boats cast on their Heads and Men in such a desperate Descent might defeat them all The Earl hereupon prayed  Ralegh  to go and perswade the Lord Admiral who being also by him made sensible that certain Destruction would be the Consequence of pursuing the former Resolution consented to enter the Port When  Ralegh  brought  Essex  the News of this Agreement and call'd out of his Boat  Entramos Entramos  as he return'd towards him the Earl threw his Hat into the Sea for Joy and prepared to weigh Anchor The Day  was now far spent and it required much Time to return the Boats of Soldiers to their own Ships So as that Night they could not attempt the Fleet  Altho' many seeming desperately valiant thought it a Fault of mine says  Ralegh  to delay it till Morning though we had neither agreed in what Manner to fight nor appointed who should lead and who second whether by boarding or otherwise neither could our Fleet possibly recover all their Men in before Sunset But both the Generals being pleased to hear me and many Times to be advised by so mean an Understanding came again to Anchor and in the very Mouth of the Harbour So that Night about    o'Clock I wrote a Letter to the Lord Admiral declaring therein my Opinion  how the Fight should be order'd  persuading him to appoint to each of the great Galleons of  Spain  two great Flyhoats to board them after the Queen's Ships had batter'd them for I knew that both St  Philip  and the Rest would burn and not yield and then to lose so many of the Queen's Ships for Company I thought too dear a Purchase and what would be termed but a  lamentable Victory  This Method being agreed on and both the Generals persuaded to lead the Body of the Fleet the Charge of the Van for putting it in Execution was upon  Ralegh  's Request granted and assigned to him The Ship himself was in called the  Warspite  was one of the Queen's and carried about Mariners The Rest appointed out of her Navy to second him were the  MaryRose  commanded by Sir  George Carew  the  Lion  by Sir  Robert Southwell  the  Rainbow  by Sir  Francis Vere  the  Swiftsure  by Capt  Cross  the  Dreadnought  by Sir  Coniers  and  Alex Clifford  the  Nonpareil  by Mr  Robert Dudley  besides  Londoners  and certain FlyBoats Thus the Lord  Thomas Howard  because the  Mer Honeur  which he commanded  was one of the greatest Ships was also left behind with the Generals but being impatient thereof he pressed them to have the Service committed to him and to that End exchanged his Ship with Mr  Dudley  Hereupon  Ralegh  observes  For my own Part as I was willing to give Honour to my Lord  Thomas  having both Precedency in the Army and being a Nobleman whom I much honoured so I was yet resolved to give and not to take Example for this Service holding my own Reputation dearest  Therefore with the first Peep of Day he weighed Anchor taking the Start of all others a good Distance and bear with the Enemy who was in the following Disposition to receive him  Under the Walls of  Cadiz  were ranged Galleys which lay with their Prows to flank his Entrance There was also a Fort called  Philip  which beat into and commanded the Harbour besides the Ordnance which lay all along the Curtain upon the Wall towards the Sea and divers other Pieces of Culverin which scoured the Channel Notwithstanding as soon as the Enemy perceived an  English  Admiral under Sail approaching several of their Galleons and other Ships of War with great Vessels besides bound for  Mexico  and other Parts also set sail Of all which the  St Philip Matthew Andrew  and  Thomas  being four of the capital Galleons of  Spain  came again to anchor under the Fort of  Puntal  in a Streight of the Harbour which leads over to  Puerto Real  On the starboard Side of them they placed three Frigats of War at their Back two great Galleons of  Lisbon  besides two well furnished Argosies and the Gallies by three and three were to interlace them as Occasion should be offered The Admiral Viceadmiral and RearAdmiral of  New Spain  with the Body of the Fleet were ranged  behind them towards  Puerto Real  hoping with this great Strength to defend the Entrance the Place being no broader from point to point than that their Line did in Effect stretch over the Streight as a Bridge and had besides the Fort of  Puntal  for their Guard  Ralegh  as aforesaid advancing in the Van was first saluted by Fort  Philip  Sir  Walter Ralegh  afterwards exemplifying how little a resolute and experienced Man of War will fear to pass by the best appointed Fort of  Europe  with the Help of a good Tide and a leading Gale of Wind and how hard a Matter it is to stop a good Ship without another as good to encounter it says  'The Fort  St Philip  terrified not us in the Year when we entered the Port of  Cadiz  neither did the Fort at  Puntal  when we were entered beat us from our anchoring by it tho' it played upon us with four DemiCannons with in Point blank from six in the Morning ▪till at Noon'  Hist of the World  lib cap Sect  next by the Cannon on the Curtain and lastly in good Order by the Gallies which lay near the Town with all their Prows bent against him as he entered  Ralegh  answered the firing of their Ordnance with a Flourish of his Trumpets and still kept driving forwards that he might draw up a Sufficiency of the  English  Fleet into Play and to engage those he passed by while he was in Action upon the Body of the Enemy Accordingly the Ships that followed beat upon the Galleys so thick that they soon betook them to their Oars and got up to join with the Galleons in the Streight as aforesaid then as they were driven to pass near him he bestow'd his Benediction from several Broadsides among them but ply'd St  Philip  the great and famous Admiral of  Spain  most constantly as being most worthy of his Fire and being now resolved to repay the Enemy's former Treatment of the  Revenge  or to second her Loss with his own Life he came to Anchor  by the great Galleons whereof the  Philip  and the  Andrew  were the two which boarded that brave  English  Ship Here he fell to battering of them very briskly expecting after awhile the FlyBoats to come up that he might board and take them And now began the Engagement to be very desperate The Lord  Thomas  came to anchor on one side of him though pretty much behind with Sir  Robert Southwell  Sir  George Carew  and the  Cliffords  on the other and Sir  Francis Vere  was towards the side of  Puntal  At last the Thunder of the Ordnance grew so great about Ten aClock in the Morning that  Essex  impatient to abide far off thrust up through the Fleet heading all those on the left Hand and on that side anchor'd next to  Ralegh  afterwards came in Captain  Cross  as near as he could but  Ralegh  to his great Honour held always single in the head of all Now after they had beat as at two Buts one upon another almost three Hours so that the Volleys of Cannon and Culverin came as thick as if it had been a Skirmish of Musketeers till  Ralegh  's Ship was in Danger of sinking in the Place he made away to  Essex  in his Skiff to desire that he would inforce the promised FlyBoats to come up that he might board for as he rid he could not long endure so great a Battery  Essex  was then coming up himself to whom  Ralegh  declared  That if the Flyboats came not he would board in the Queen's Ship for it was the same Loss to burn or sink and one he must endure  Then the Earl promised him  That whatever he attempted he would second him in Person upon Honour  In the mean while the Lord Admiral  Howard  being also at first disposed to advance but the River was so choaked that he could not pass in the  Ark  came with the Lord  Thomas  in the  Nonpareil  and  while  Ralegh  was speaking to  Essex the Marshal  Vere  who thought it some Touch says  Ralegh  to his great esteemed Valour to ride behind me so many Hours got up ahead of my Ship which Lord  Thomas  perceiving headed him again myself being but a Quarter of an Hour absent At my return finding myself from being the first to be but the third I presently let slip Anchor and thrusting in between the Lord  Thomas  and the Marshal went further ahead than all of them before and thrust myself athwart the Channel so as I was sure none should outstart me again for that Day Essex  thinking his Ship stronger than the rest thrust  Clifford  's aside and still got next to  Ralegh  on the left Hand ahead of all that Rank but Lord  Thomas  while  Vere  secretly fastned a Rope on  Ralegh  's Shipside towards him and drew himself up equal with him but some of his Company advertising him thereof he caused it to be cut asunder so  Vere  fell back into his Place whom  Ralegh  guarded all but his Prow from the Sight of the Enemy  But now  Ralegh  having no Hopes of his Flyboats and  Essex  with the Lord  Thomas  having promised to second him he laid out a Warp by the Side of the  Philip  to close the Wind hindering him otherwise to board her and when the Admiral thereof with the Commanders of the other three wooden Apostles found that  Essex  and the Lord  Thomas  began to do the like they all slipped Anchor and ran aground Heaps of Soldiers and Mariners tumbling into the Sea like Coals out of a Sack says  Ralegh  into many Ports at once some drowning some sticking in the Mud He also tells us the  Philip  thereupon burnt herself and another Author more particularly in these Words  As  Ralegh  thought to have boarded the great Galleon  St Philip  a Negro gave fire to the Powder and  escaped by swimming it gave so great a Crack that the Mast was blown up into the Air as if it had been an Arrow A Pinnace that lay near it was burnt but the Men escaped in Boats The other Galleon called  St Thomas  was likewise blown up but did no Harm to the  Englsh He also mentions  two Easterlings which ran ashore and were burnt but says he the  St Matthew  and  St Andrew  of    or    Ton apiece were saved from running aground and carried away  However he does not inform us particularly by whom and others seem to have done  Ralegh  more wrong in nominating other Persons and omitting him in the Performance since it appears under his own Handwriting that he took them both himself And this agrees with the Manner his Letter of this Action in Print has expressed it where he says  those Galleons were recovered with our Boats e'er they could get out to fire them  Here he observes upon the Enemies running to the Shores and thus firing their Ships that the Spectacle was very lamentable on their Side for many drowned themselves many half burnt leaped into the Water very many hanging at the Ropes▪ends by the Ship's Side under the Water even to the Lips many swimming with grievous Wounds 'till struck under Water and put out of their Pain and withal such huge Fires and such tearing of the Ordnance in the  Great Philip  and the rest when the Flames came to them that  Ralegh  thought there was here to be seen the most lively Figure of Hell itself  Thus the Victory was obtained by Sea and the Bay resigned by two some say by four o'Clock in the Afternoon though no more of the  English  were constantly and closely engaged than the Ships and Commanders beforementioned against the six great Galleons Gallies with the Fleet of  New  Spain  Argosies and Frigats to the Number of or as  Ralegh  himself reckons them besides the Fort of  Puntal  playing upon them all the while After the Victory  Ourselves spared the Lives of all says  Ralegh  but the  Flemings  who did little or nothing in the Fight used merciless Slaughter 'till they were by myself and afterwards by my Lordadmiral beaten off  Then did they hasten to land the Army and attempt the Town  Cadiz  was a large and beautiful City and being the chief See of the Bishop had a good Cathedral Church Abbey Nunnery and fine College of Jesuits was strongly situated both by Nature and Art the Buildings of hard Stone all flat roof'd after the  Turkish  Manner so that having lodged Heaps of great Stones on the Tops of their Houses every Woman could endanger the Passengers in the Streets which were very narrow perhaps to avoid the great Heat All the Houses had fair Windowframes and large folding Shutters but were barr'd with Iron and none glazed except the Churches They had few Chimnies but in some lower Outrooms for necessary Uses seeming to be more careful of keeping themselves from roasting than to have much of any Thing roasted  in which there were of all Sorts above Soldiers in pay and about Horse of the Gentry and Caviliers of  Xeres  gathered together upon the Discovery of the  English  Fleet two Days before as they lay becalmed off  Cape St Mary  The Horsemen sallied out to resist their Landing but were so vigorously assailed and overpowered by the  English  that the greatest Part made away to the Bridge which leads to the Main called  Puente de Suaço  the rest retreated to the Town and were so eagerly pursued that they were driven to forsake their Horses at the Gate which the Inhabitants durst not open to admit them so that they were forced to leap down an old Wall into the Suburbs which the  English  Vanguard close at their Heels perceiving with  Essex  at their Head followed them and so the Town was carried with  a sudden Fury in a short Space of Time and with very little Loss  Ralegh  though he had received a grievous Wound in his Leg being much torn and deformed with a Splintershot in the Fight yet willing to encourage the Army with his Presence and desirous of seeing the Actions and Dispositions of the Enemy he was carried ashore on the Shoulders of his Men where the Lordadmiral out of his Care and Regard sent him one of his Horses but his own being recovered in due Time was made ready for him  The Torment he endur'd and the Fear he was continually in of being shoulder'd by the tumultuous Soldiers abandon'd to Spoil and Rapine without any Respect of Persons made him unable to abide above an Hour in the Town  After the Surrender was over Order was given to transport the religious Men and Women Merchant's Wives c to  Port St Mary  that no Violence might be offer'd them They had also Liberty to take as many of their Cloaths or Goods as they could carry with them which produced a remarkable Example in a beautiful young  Spanish  Lady who leaving all that was precious and valuable bore away her old and decrepid Husband upon her Back whom before she had hidden from the Danger of the Enemy herein imitating the Piety of the  Bavarian  Women after the Conquest of their Country by the Emperor  Conrade  III  The same Night therefore he return'd chiefly because there was no Admiral on board to order the Fleet or indeed few Mariners left in the Navy  all  to use his own Words  running headlong to the Sack  and also because he was fit for nothing but Rest and Retirement at that Time Otherwise he might like the rest of the Commanders have rewarded himself for his Services But leaving them in safe Possession at his Departure they promised to preserve for him his Share of the Booty and to give him a good Quarter of the Town of which as  we have it under his own Hand they defrauded him He had desired the Consent of the Generals that he might go and secure or destroy the  Indian  Fleet which was said to be worth twelve Millions and lay in  PuertoReal  Road but they desired to consider on it till next Morning At Break of Day  Ralegh  sent his Brother Sir  John Gilbert  and Sir  Arthur Throgmorton  as also Sir  Henry Leonard  to know their Resolution but the Generals sent back to desire he would come ashore into the Town  Ralegh  very favourable imputes these Evasions to the great Confusion in which it was almost impossible for them to order many Things at once In the Afternoon of the same Day the Merchants of  Cadiz  and  Seville  offer'd the Generals by the Committee of the ContractationHouse with the Purveyor Corrigidor and other Officers two Millions of  Ducats  to spare that Fleet neither could this bring them to any Resolution so that Advantage was lost  Ralegh  might possibly insist upon a larger Composition by saying  They ought first to be Masters of the Fleet and ransom it afterwards for if they offer'd two Millions already they would give four when it was taken  But it appears plain enough that  Essex  was not for having the Fleet seiz'd upon unless by Sir  Christopher Blunt  Sir  Edward Conway  Sir  Thomas Gerrard  and other Land Officers which  Ralegh  would not consent to for the Honour of the Sailors as it does appear from  Cambden  that the LordAdmiral would not consent to any Composition  For we came  said he  to consume them and not compound with them  But they saved him the Trouble for the next Morning being the d of  June  the Duke of  Medina  caused all that Fleet of Merchantmen to be set on Fire because he was convinced from their being beset so vigilantly by  Ralegh  who had the Charge of them that they must needs fall into his Hands Thus both Galleons Frigats Argosies with the Fleet of  Nueva Espana  and all except the Gallies which it seems escaped were consumed to Ashes Good Store of the Enemy's Ordnance was recover'd out of their Ships and great Quantities of Merchandize Plate Jewels and Money out of the Town Their whole Loss being computed at twenty Millions of Ducats  The Earl of  Essex  in a brief Narrative of the Advantages accruing to  England  and Losses to the  Spaniard  by this Expedition says  'The  English  took two Galleons routed Gallies with an unequal Number of Ships freed many of their Countrymen condemn'd to the Gallies and releas'd several  Spaniards  from Imprisonment took the best fortify'd City in all  Spain  and stayed thirteen Days in their Country brought home besides the Galleons aforesaid Brass Guns with a rich Booty and the Sailors but especially the Soldiers great Plunder the Enemy lost of his most serviceable Ships  Indian  Merchantmen and others besides vast Quantities of Ammunition Provisions c rendering it almost impossible he should in some Time appear again at Sea in a formidable Manner'  Many rich Prisoners were given to the Land Commanders  so as that Sort were very rich says  Ralegh  some had for their Prisoners sixteen or twenty Thousand some ten thousand Ducats besides great Houses of Merchandize What the Generals have gotten I know least concludes he they protest it is little For my own Part I have gotten a lame Leg and a deformed for the rest either I spoke too late or it was otherwise resolved I have not been wanting in good Words or exceeding kind and regardful Usage but have Possession of nought but Poverty and Pain  It was long disputed whether the Town should be held or no say Sir  Francis Vere  who adds that my Lord of  Essex  seemed to affect to remain there in Person as we may add  Vere  did too  because he says he offer'd to defend it with Men till her Majesty's Pleasure should be known when in Truth the Queen's Pleasure in this Particular was known before they left  England  For  Essex  himself informs us he sent Letters from  Plymouth  before they set sail by his Secretary  Edward Reignold  to the Council at  Greenwich  wherein he purposed  to dwell in a Port of the Enemy's and to make a continual Diversion of the Wars  but says he  My Letters were neither answer'd nor liked of  And much less was the same Proposal now relish'd in  Cadiz  when so many wanted to guard and secure the Treasures they had got and it was computed they would all soon grow in Want of Provisions nay one of his own Knights advis'd him to master and destroy Ships rather than Towns as what would make the Enemy more unable to molest them and procure him Wealth and solid Honour without Riot and Ruin of the Innocent besides the Riches in Ships could not be so easily conceal'd and convey'd away as in Towns also they might be brought into  England  and would be visible Monuments to his Glory but Towns tho' soon won could not be long enjoy'd  For these and other Reasons  Essex  was prevail'd upon to leave  Cadiz  but they first of all caused the City to be raz'd and with the Castles and Fortifications fired all but the Churches and Religious Houses together with all the naval Tackle and Provision they could meet with which they either needed not or could not conveniently carry away Their Courtesy however to the People especially of Distinction and all who had made no Opposition was such that at their Departure the  Spaniards  did the  English  the Justice to say  Tho' they were Hereticks as to Religion yet as to the  rest they had behaved themselves with generous Bravery  On the th of  July  the Army embarked and in Council it was insisted on to lie out at Sea for intercepting the  WestIndian  Fleet  but the Scarceness of our Victuals says  Vere  overthrew that Purpose  So Resolution was taken to make for  England  and visit the  Spanish  Coasts in the Way to destroy their Shipping The first Place they made to was  Faro  a good large populous Town but unfenc'd and a Bishop's See of  Portugal  Here the  English  landing and marching up to the Town the Inhabitants deserted it and left them in full Possession who after having rested and refreshed themselves five or six Days brought good Store of Provisions to the Ships also some Pieces of Artillery and the valuable Library of the late famous Bishop  Osorius  This was  Hieronymus Osorius  a Native of  Lisbon  and Bishop of  Si  ves  and  Algarva  characteriz'd by Foreigners to have been a Man of strict Virtue in his Morals and Master of a florid Pen in his Writings which were publish'd at  Rome  in four Volumes by his Nephew who also wrote his Life See more in  Thuanus Anno  when he died aged Years and in  Anthony Tessier  's Additions to that Historian's  Eloges des Hommes Scavans  c vo vol  Utrecht  p This Bishops was for none of his Writings more noted with us than his  Epistolary Admonition to Queen  Elizabeth and his  Controversy  with that learned Orator and Civilian Dr  Walter Haddon  who dying in the Year before he had compleated his last Book against  Osorius  it was finish'd and publish'd by  John Fox  the  Martyrologist  in and four Years after translated into  English  wherein  Fox  charges the Bishop's Book against the Doctor with being full of Lies Calumnies and Errors And the Lord  Bacon  where he notes among the Distempers of Learning that Luxuriancy of Style which began to prevail in  Luther  's Time with the Causes thereof which introduced an affected Study of Eloquence and grew to such Excess that Authors regarded a Roundness of Period more than Richness of Invention Soundness of Argument or Depth of Judgment and were charmed rather with Softness than Strength Sweetness than Solidity and Fulness of Words than Weight of Matter he instances among others then growing into Esteem the flowing and watery Vein of  Osorius De Augment  Scientiarum  lib  There is another Author who  mentions the taking of this Town and consequently that Library among  Ralegh  's Victories describing the Buildings to have been left so demolished as to yield no Covering for their Idols But since that Library is observed by  Camden  to have been thought by right  Essex  's Prize as if this Earl had somehow contended to engross it to himself it may somewhat direct us to whose greater Value for the Labours of the Learned and more public Spirit in this particular 'tis owing that it was more commendably bestowed being brought into  England  says  Monson  and made it seems an exemplary Foundation of the  publick Library  which was begun by Sir  Thomas Bodley  the ensuing Year at  Oxford  What Share  Ralegh  had in this Disposal towards the said renowned Undertaking of that learned Knight his Countryman and Acquaintance Authorities are wanting further than by Surmise from these Premises to certify But this we have expresly enough transmitted to us of him by  Bodley  himself even in the next Reign about nine Years after this Time when  Ralegh  was under great Misfortunes and therefore when an Act of Munificence must shine with the greatest Splendor that he generously contributed towards the Improvement of that Library the Sum of  l for which says Sir  Thomas Bodley  I will intreat the Vicechancellor to move the University for their Letters to him and the other Benefactors mentioned with him of publick Thanks  When the Forces were got again on Board they failed to the  Groyne  and looked into the Bay but  the Wind being unfavourable they thought it dangerous to enter therefore and because the Victuals daily grew more scarce so that in some Ships there was already extreme Want says Sir  Francis Vere  it was resolved to make Homewards However Sir  William Monson  in Favour of  Essex  's Impatience to go upon fresh Exploits computes they had enough Provision to supply them seven Weeks  Monson  also imputes the general Declension of the Officers from any further Invasion of the  Spaniards  at this Time to the Covetousness of those who wanted to secure the Treasures they had amassed And indeed  Vere  discovers not any Concurrence now with  Essex  's new Schemes of Adventure as might have been expected towards a Patron who had shewn him so much Favour and Countenance but visibly hastens Home upon the Complaint of the Scarcity aforesaid And yet that which might be thought  Vere  's true Motive for returning was never imputed to the Lordadmiral nor Sir  Walter Ralegh  tho' both by Speech and Writing they argued for it as much as any for they had engrossed no Booty that might be endangered by entering upon further Engagements abroad Yet had they other Objections to these inconsiderate Projects than the Want of Victuals or Sickness of Men for after both these Inconveniencies in  Ralegh  's Ship were proposed to be redress'd by  Essex  as  Monson  tells us  Ralegh  was as resolute against hazarding the Honour as others the Riches that was got at  Cadiz  and in this entirely agreed with the Lordadmiral who persuaded them to consider how subject they might be to great Losses in little Enterprizes which would not add much to their Praise if they succeeded but surely would to their Discredit if they failed This being the Sense of the greater or  the wiser Part most of the Fleet returned with the Lordadmiral to  Plymouth  on the th of  August  following and the Rest with the Earl of  Essex  two Days after who thence took his Journey to Court as  Ralegh  probably did at the same Time On the th of the same Month we find by a Letter from the Council of State to the Lordadmiral then advanced with the Fleet to the  Downs  that  Ralegh  as well as  Essex  had been with them and probably with the Queen from whom we hear of no Objections made to  Ralegh  's Conduct in the whole Action Therefore probably he was among those principal Actors therein whom she distinguished with liberal Praises and Rewards Yet that Letter does discover her Majesty's Dissatisfaction towards the Lordadmiral that he did not lie in wait for the Carracks or the  WestIndian  Fleet as  Essex  had intreated him to do And whereas Sir  Francis Vere  says that when  Essex  landed in the West and left Orders with him for dissolving not only the Landforces but the Shipping there arose much Strife between the said Mariners and his  LowCountry  Troops at their Parting the Sailors being determined to share in the Chests and Packs wherewith the Soldiers had most unproportionably enriched themselves in the late Spoil at which  Vere  complained to the Lordadmiral for Redress adding that  some other principal Officers of the Fleet  took the Sailors Part and as if they thought them unreasonably dealt with who had made Way by the Seafight for the Soldiers to get those Riches by Land asked him  whether the Mariners should have nothing  To which he answered  their Hopes in the  Indian  Fleet were more to be desired than that Trosh as he calls it which the Land▪men had got in the Town so as they had none to blame but their Officers  and their bad Fortune Which Answer  says he  was taken to Heart and is not forgotten to this Hour of which I feel the Smart  If  Ralegh  was one of those principal Officers here pointed at who thus stood the Sailors Advocate as he might be notwithstanding his expeditious Progress to Court the indifferent Manner wherewith  Vere  has treated him is very accountable to me But  Vere  has further betrayed his Partiality in not telling us the Consequence of his said Application to the LordAdmiral which appears in that Letter and others from the Council aforesaid to have procured the Disposal of the  Spanish  Plunder towards the Payment of the  English  Navy and that  Vere  's  LowCountry  Regiments should not return before they were searched both in Ships and Person As for  Essex  he wrote a  Censure of the Omissions  in this Voyage which he imputes to the Dissensions of his Council and Colleague Whence the common Historians have been led indiscriminately to arraign the setting forth such Expeditions under Commanders of equal Authority and have so much neglected giving these their distinct Commendations for what they did as to cavil at them for what they left undone while others more gratefully observe  That never was so much Riches and Renown acquired with the like naval Success  well justifying the Honours which were paid to Sir  Walter Ralegh  both by the Authors who dedicated Books to him this Year the Painters and Sculptors who have appropriated this Seafight to his Portraits and those other Advancers of the like honorary Arts who in their Discourses of  Medals  and  Intagias  have thought him worthy for this among his many other Actions and Excellencies of that metallic Commemoration which is more  usually among us confined to Princes and crowned Heads  Mr  Evelyn  in his Book of  Medals  gives us the Sculpture of a large one that was struck this Year having the Arms of  England France  and  Holland  in a threefold knot on one Side representing a triple League against  Spain  with this Inscription  Rumpitnr haud facile  and on the  reverse  a Navy of great Ships at Sea under the Name of  Jehovah  with this  Epigraph Quid me persequeris  Hence thought by some to have been in Memory of the Victory at  Cadiz  but as he tells us it was struck upon the Alarm menacing those three Nations on the Surprize of  Callais  this Year Therefore where he is speaking of those adventrous  Argonauts  in these Times who deserved the Honour of  Medals  for their Exploits at Sea among whom he reckons chiefly those who found out  new Worlds  planted  Colonies  and enlarged the  British Empire  he adds I know not whether there was any Medals of the Earl of  Essex  's Expedition to  Cadiz  and of the  Heroes  who accompanied him So recommends Sir  W Ralegh  to that Distinction as being  'a Person of extraordinary Merit for his  Learning  and  Experience  and who is he continues my Author that deplores not his being so happily cut off and our since Want of such as  Ralegh  was to gratify the crafty and Malicious'  Further where he is subsiding from  Arms  to  Arts  he mentions  Ralegh  again among the foremost of those illustrious Persons of whom he says  'How should one rejoice to find in more  lasting Matter  than painted Cloth the true  Effigies  of such as were famous for  both  '  Numismata  fol p  About two Months after  Ralegh  's Return from the Conquest of  Cadiz  we find him making a new Attempt to continue the Interest and Correspondence he had so hopefully begun in  Guiana  To this End he mann'd out and stor'd with all proper Conveniencies and Merchandize for Trade and Discovery in those Parts a handsome Pinnace which had been with him in the late Engagement called after his own Name the  Watt  therefore probably one of his own Ships The Command of her he committed to Captain  Leonard Berrie  but thro' Contrariety of Winds and other Accidents they made it the latter End of  December  following before  they got out of  Weymouth  In the Beginning of  March  they discover'd the Coast and fell into the River  Wiapouco  a River almost in four Degrees North of the Line and about sixteen Leagues in Length but not being able to find the Head of its Falls nor meeting with any of the Inhabitants to supply them with Provisions they return'd and made towards the great Town called  Aramatto  where they stored themselves to their Desire After this several of those Natives came in Canoes and traded with the  English  in their Ships Then Captain  Berrie  hired some of them with a Present of Knives to go back unto the River  Cawo  and invite the Ruler of that Place named  Ritimo  on board who accordingly came to them in the River  Chiana  where he and his Train were feasted and traffick'd with the  English  much to their Satisfaction And thither also flock'd from their several Towns great Numbers of a civiliz'd Race of  Carribes  who brought great Plenty of Victuals and Tobacco which they exchanged for such Commodities as the  English  were well instructed to carry thither After they had declar'd their unanimous Desire to have the  English  come and rout the  Spaniards  take Command of the  Orenoque  and dwell in the bordering Nations they departed and the  English  made away to the  Careres  or Triangular Islands and kept trading on with the People of the neighbouring Towns who familiarly resorted to them Then they passed along through the River  Marawin  to  Quiparia  and  Macirra  for about or Leagues upward to the Falls of that River and to the Sight of a rich Country above where the People were of an extraordinary Stature and carried Bows hafted with Gold but were forced to return without compleating that Discovery for Want of Provision though my Author  one of the Adventurers thought the Palmito's and other Trees in the Woods would have supported them till they could have rewarded themselves with what  might have done us good  says he  as long as we had lived  On the th of  April  they returned from that River and wandered through several others till about four Days after they fell into the  Coritine  In this River they met a Bark called the  John  of  London  commanded by Captain  Leigh  the same I suppose who afterwards made other Voyages to  Guiana  and took further Possession of the Country not by Force the  Spaniards  Title but Consent of the People tho' for a Prince indeed who deserved no Right there which he had not the Spirit to maintain And falling down some five Leagues from the Mouth thereof upon Intelligence that the  Dessekebe  with which that River meets would lead them within a Day's Journey of the Lake  Perima  whereon  Manoa  was suppsed to stand they meant to discover a Passage to this rich City But having rowed in their Boats about fifty Leagues from the Mouth of the  Coritine  to the Falls of the said River where having been credibly inform'd that five Days Journey further there was a Fall impassable and finding withal some of the Towns bordering thereon so importunate to engage them in Wars against their Enemies the  Waccawaes  which would turn greatly to the Disadvantage of the  English  when Sir  Walter Ralegh  should again return thither because he would have Occasion to pass that River which was reported to have Gold in it they therefore were constrained to return So clearing themselves of this Coast they took their Course to the Islands of the  WestIndies  Here my Author who was a Gentleman of the Company after having spoke in Praise of the Climate how  temperate and wholsome it is tho' within the  Tropic  and so near the  Equinoctial  as also how docible the Natives and humane especially to  Englishmen  tho' a savage and uncultivated People he proceeds to speak of their Riches in these Words  In the upper Countries they go apparel'd being as it seems of most civil Dispositions having great Store of Gold as we are certainly inform'd by the lower  Indians  of whom we had some Gold which they brought and bought in the high Country of  Wiana  being able to buy no more because they wanted the Things which now we have left among them  That there are many rich Mines and Minerals in  Guiana  as well as Mountains and Rivers impregnate with Gold is not only thus constantly intimated by the  English  Travellers thither of these Times but attested by the  Spaniards  themselves in their further Discoveries many Years after as may be seen in Father  D'Acuna  's Relation of the River of  Amazons  and other  Spanish  Authors But as for the rich City of  Manoa  just before spoken of which they had called  El Dorado  it seems now to have been invented by these  Indians  as a gilded Bait to draw the  Spaniards  into League with them against their Enemies and propagated by the  Spaniards  themselves to inhance the Merit of their Travels and sharpen the Appetite of their Successors to pursue the Enterprize for no such City having been found it has been reputed a Kind of  Philosopher's Stone  in  Cosmography  Yet like that in  Chymistry  tho' undiscover'd itself it was and may further be the Means of many profitable Discoveries If such a Metropolis had been distinctly ascertain'd by  Antonio de Herera  and  John de Laet  's excellent Accounts and Maps of these Parts and had not appear'd doubtful even to Father  D'Acuna  himself I see not how Monsieur  Sanson  who in graved a little Map to explain the  French  Translation of the said Jesuit's Discourse could have omitted it and for the new Edition published in another Map was graved by Mr  De Lisle  which tho' more copious and compleat is not as I can hear more particular in this Respect  Then having taken a little further Notice of their Manners with the Plenty and Variety of their Provisions he shews what Course his Company took  homewards and how they arriv'd safe at  Plymouth  on the th of  June  following  Thus have we abstracted all the Voyages Sir  Walter Ralegh  set forth for Discoveries as well as the warlike Expeditions in which he was engag'd as far as they have been preserv'd in  Hakluyt  's Collections Nor was it without just Reason that his said naval Enterprizes were thus carefully gather'd therein since  Ralegh  's Encouragement was such of this extraordinary Undertaking to raise a Grove of Laurels in a Manner out of the Sea that should overspread the Island with Glory and might be still made to shoot more spaciously afresh were the Author and his Work reviv'd in a Manner suitable to their Deserts that when even the first Edition of these  English  Voyages was published and before they could receive any Lustre from the  Guianian  Discoveries the said Author in his Preface ackcowledges Sir  Walter Ralegh  to have been one of those Benefactors  from whom he had received his chief Light into the  Western  Navigations  Nor did he only oblige  Hakluyt  with communicating divers maritime Adventures in which he himself and Countrymen were concern'd but procured for him at no small Expence some very scarce Voyages and Discoveries of Foreigners which were unprinted and was moreover at the Charge of rewarding some Persons of Learning and Leisure to translate them into  English  for the further Enrichment of the said Collections One Instance of this Kind he slightly mentions himself For in his learned Enquiries into the Name of the  Red Sea  he speaks of a Voyage made thither by the  Portugal  Viceroy of the  EastIndies  named  Stephen Gama  the Narrative whereof was written by  Castro  one of his principal Commanders which Discourse says he I gave Mr  Richard Hakluyt  to publish  Further we might expatiate upon this Care he had for the Preservation of other Mens Fame but here a gallant Exploit sollicits our Regard by which he much encreased his own  For the Earl of  Essex  grown discontented to see his Party of such little Power at Court and the  Cecilians  carry all before them that he could not advance several of his Friends and Followers to certain Posts in the Army not even Sir  Thomas Bodley  to the Office of Secretary whom he had perhaps prejudic'd with his prodigal Praises to the Queen she having prefer'd Sir  Robert Cecyl  to that Place in his Absence at  Cadiz  whom he had as intemperately traduc'd  Sir  Thomas Bodley  informs us that before he returned from the united Provinces in and after the Earl of  Essex  used him so kindly that though he meant to settle his Dependence only on the Lord  Burghley  as best able and most willing to work his Advancement with the Queen yet the Earl who sought by all Devices to divert her Liking both from the Father and the Son especially did often to withdraw his Affection also from both entertain the Queen with prodigal Speeches of his Sufficiency for a Secretary which were accompanied with such Words of Disgrace against the latter  'That neither she herself took any great Pleasure to prefer me the sooner says  Bodley  for she hated his Ambition and would give little Countenance to any of his Followers and both the Lord  Burghley  and his Son waxed jealous of my Courses'  And a little further  'when I had thoroughly bethought me first in the  Earl  of the slender Holdfast he had in the Queen of an endless Opposition of the chiefest of our Statesmen likely still to wa  t upon him of his perillous feeble and uncertain Advice as well in his own as in all the Causes of his Friends and when I had fully considered how untowardly these two Counsellors were affected to me how ill it became my natural Disposition to become a Stickler in publick Faction and how well I was able to live of my self c I was resolved to take my Farewell of State Employments and so retire from Courts'  resolved to seek by further Services abroad to strengthen that Interest at home which he now found so weak and unserviceable  for the King of  Spain  enrag'd at the late Overthrow and Destruction of  Cadiz  had immediately thereupon muster'd up the naval Powers from all his Ports at  Lisbon  for a new Expedition upon  England  and  Ireland  but his old Enemies the Winds and the Waves so speedily disabled and dispersed them that the Queen heard of their Fate before she had any Advertisement of their Design and as she then took Care to fortify such Castles as lay most obvious to any such Invasion so now that she heard the Storm was gathering again by the Repair of the said shattered Fleet and Recruits added to it threatning a new Descent upon  Ireland  she resolved also to recollect her Forces by Sea At first indeed before she was well informed of the Enemy's Strength she had only armed and victualled ten of her best Ships and caused the  LowCountries  to provide the like Number under Admiral  Duvenvard  But when the Lord  Thomas Howard  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  who were pitched upon for the Command of this Fleet declared their Hopes of doing any great Service with it to be weak and uncertain and the News of the  Adelantado  's stronger Preparations at  Feroll  and the  Groyne  were daily confirmed a new Council was call'd in which it was resolved that this naval Force which the Queen had appointed was too great for a Discovery and too little for an Attempt as in the Earl of  Essex  's Apology is rightly observed Therefore passing over the  Addition  so unaccountably deficient in the said  Apology  there were added to the first prepared Fleet about ten Ships more of the royal Navy which with the other Men of War Victuallers Transports and many stout Vessels belonging to the Nobles Knights and Gentlemen who were Adventurers in this Voyage amounted to about  Sail as we are informed by Sir  Arthur Gorges  an Officer in this Enterprize These Ships then being all sufficiently manned with Sailors received an Army of Soldiers with ten Pieces of Artillery for the Field and Volunteers most georgeously equipped The Proportion of Victuals was for four Months at large Allowance and double Apparel both for the Soldiers and Mariners The LordAdmiral  Howard  being indisposed declined the Command which therefore was granted in Chief to the Earl of  Essex  but the Lord  Thomas Howard  was made ViceAdmiral and Sir  Walter Ralegh  RearAdmiral in the Expedition and these three with four others made up the Council of War The Purpose of this grand Preparation was to defeat and destroy the  Spanish  Fleet aforesaid at  Ferroll  as well as in other Ports of the Enemy also to seize upon such  Indian  Fleets of Treasure as they should meet with belonging to the King of  Spain  but especially to conquer retain and engarrison most of the Isles of the  Azores  These Islands are situate in the  Atlantick  or western Ocean between and Degrees and distant from  England  about Leagues They were so named by the  Portuguese  from a Kind of Hawks call'd by them  Asores  by the  Romans Accipitres  and by us  Goshawks  these Islands breeding Abundance of those Birds Though  Ortelius  derives the Name from a  French  Word signifying to dry or wither without giving Reason for his Etymology They are nine in Number and named  St Mary  's which is near the Coast of  Spain  St  Michael  's which is the largest of them being about Miles long the  Ter  era  so called because lying the third from  Spain  is the strongest  Gratiosa  from the Fertility of the Soil and pleasant Temper of the Air  St George  's like the two first from the Saint's Name on whose Day it was discovered the  Pike  from the wonderful sharp Mountain thereon which rises Steeplewise three Miles high is six or seven Miles in Circuit at the Base and reported to have  Vulcano  's in its Bowels disgorging Flakes and Stones of Fire  Fayall  was so called from  Faya  the Beech tree which grew in Plenty there  Flores  from the Abundance of Flowers which overspread the Island and  Cuervo  from the vast Flocks of Crows or Ravens which were observed to breed therein  and above all the  Tercera  wherefore this Enter prize was called the  Island Voyage  About the th of  July  following the whole Fleet set sail from  Plymouth  and for two Days had a fair leading Wind in which Time all the Ships received their Directions from the Council of War with the Meetingplaces from Time to Time in Case of Separation by Tempest Fight Chase or any other Accident But being now advanced about sixty Leagues there arose such an exceeding high Storm full in their Teeth and continued for four Days together that all the Ships were driven with great Detriment to several back into  Plymouth  and many died of the Sickness it had brought upon them While they lay here Windbound for a Month and their Provisions much damaged and consumed  Essex  in company with Sir  Walter Ralegh  rode post to Court The Earl was very forward in his Proposals to set out again with the Fleet as soon as it should be repaired or at least one Half of it being sure the Enemy should have felt the Weight and Charge of the Journey But her Majesty not accepting his Offer it was more advisedly resolved to proportion their Expedition to the Opportunities which remained the Season being so far elapsed and their Provisions so much exhausted therefore  Essex  had Orders from her Majesty to discharge the Land Forces all but the thousand  LowCountry  Soldiers then thought the best and most experienc'd of this army whereby though they were disabled of disembarking at  Ferroll  and attacking the Enemy there by Land yet  Essex  offered to send  certain Fireships into the Bay and second them with the two  Spanish  Galleons last Year taken with some great Flyboats and Merchantmen to destroy their Shipping and leave the Queen's own  English  built Ships at the Mouth of the Harbour with a principal Commander to secure their Retreat and this was allowed of but with some Limitations as  Essex  confesses in one Place which in another we find to be an absolute Bar to hazard any other of the Ships and as absolute a Restraint of the Earl himself from going into the Harbour to put this Project in practise but that it should be done by that Principal Commander he would have left behind whether through Care of his Person as a Nobleman or to have it attempted by one of the greatest Abilities and Experience for such a naval Exploit I cannot say but Sir  Walter Ralegh  was prefer'd to the Execution of this Service and as Sir  Francis Vere  observes the Charge of firing the Fleet was undertaken by him  During this Absence of  Essex  and  Ralegh  at Court which was not above seven Days there fell out such exceeding tempestuous Weather as very much distressed the Fleet both at  Plymouth Road  and  Ca  water  insomuch that one of  Ralegh  's own Ships the  Roebuck  of Tons Burthen ran aground and bulg'd herself so became unserviceable for that Voyage though much Pains and Care were taken by all Hands and especially the Lord  Thomas Howard  himself in Person to have preserved her On the th of  August  following they weighed Anchor and with much Labour set sail again being becalm'd but the weather growing afterwards somewhat favourable they held their Course for the  NorthCape  Six Days afterwards they fell across the Bay of  Alchaser  or  Biscay  and at last bore full into it much to the  Dislike of  Ralegh  's Pilot a skilful Mariner named  Broadb  nt  who thought it very perillous for so great a Fleet so wilfully to imbay there and upon an Enemy's Coasts yet as it was the General's Course they comply'd The next Day they were here for several Hours beaten and scattered about by a prodigious Storm wherein one of the late taken Prizes named  St Matthew  falling into a Headsea and having her  Sprit sail  out broke her  Boltsprit  and  Foremast  overboard close to the  Partners  The Fall of Masts also broke two Anchors and carried the third away and her  Mainmast  with her rolling and tumbling had so loosened itself that it was in Danger of breaking in the  Step  whereby she would soon have been sunk had not her Captain Sir  George Carew  with great Resolution and Hazard carried her into  England  and exchanged her for another In the same Storm the other  Spanish  Prize the  St Andrew  spent her  Maintopmast  and lost Company for some Days but all the rest of the Fleet kept labouring in the Bay till first  Ralegh  and some Ships of his Squadron which happened to carry the  LowCountry  Soldiers clear'd out and made the best of their Way to the next Rendezvous and afterwards several of the Earl's losing him sailed thither also in search of him This gave Rise to a Misrepresentation by  Ralegh  's Adversaries that he had designedly withdrawn himself and that Part of the Fleet while  Essex  himself incurred a most just Censure throughout the whole Fleet by making the high Land of  Portugal  and bearing in so close to the Shore that he alarmed all the Country to make Defence against him Afterwards as the Fleet being joined again was passing towards the South almost as far as the Isles of  Bayon Ralegh  's Ship the  Warspite  being then in the Center of them on the th  of  August  broke her  Mainyard  asunder in the very midst by the  Parrel Essex  discovered in his Ship a desperate Leak by which he had muchado to escape drowning Here it was agreed that till  Ralegh  's Ship should be repaired he might keep cruising about the Height of the  Rock  where they were to unite and pass the  South Cape  yet the next Morning before that Reparation could be made  Raleigh  had a Message to attend  Essex  with all Speed that they might put in with the Land which was impossible for  Ralegh  to do being unable to work upon a Wind as having but a  Foresail  and  Mizen  and the Wind almost off the Land besides if he could have made the Land with that Sail it was thought Madness to put upon the Enemies Coast in that Condition when if the Wind should change to the West he must in Want of his  Mainsail  have yielded or perished so found himself necessitated to ply up and down for two Days till the said Fraction was mended In this Distress▪ there was no Direction given for any other of the Fleet to attend upon  Ralegh  yet Sir  William Brook  in the  Dreadnought  tarried with him also Lord  Thomas Howard  very affectionately offered all the Assistance he could give and several other of the Sea Captains voluntarily did the like but  Ralegh  would admit of no more than three or four small Men of War to accompany him and ordered the rest even of his own Squadron to repair to the  Admiral  So far was he from projecting a Division of the Fleet by entreating any to forsake  Essex  and abide with him as it was afterwards very falsely represented to incense  Essex  against  Ralegh  for contriving the Frustration of their first resolved Attempt and as  Ralegh  himself when they met at the  Azores  so satisfactorily made evident that the said Imputation turned only to the Shame of its Contrivers  When  Ralegh  had repaired the Damages of the Storm he here in with the Coast making all the Enquiry he could after  Essex  and the Fleet but could hear no Tidings of them he sent into the Isles of  Bayon  and towards the  South Cape  well knowing the Earl could not then put into  Feroll  or the  Groyne  as was afterwards colourably pretended he would have done had they united the Wind being flat against him and the whole Fleet having overshot that Coast near Leagues before the Mainyard of  Ralegh  's Ship was broken and besides that they could not recover it again both those  Spanish  Prizes were wanting which only were to have been ventured in the Service Hereupon  Ralegh  shaped his Course to the  Rock  which was appointed for the general Rendezvous expecting not only with good Reason to meet  Essex  there but with great Desire his own Force being so small and the Enemy as he heard out at Sea with a powerful Fleet Yet those who could suspect  Ralegh  would prefer a Separation dangerous and disadvantageous as it was now would needs have had it thought there was much more Reason for that Suspicion when there came to  Ralegh  at the  Rock  near Sail more most of them his own Victuallers and Transports but the Truth is that having lost  Essex  during the Storm in the Bay and missed him also at the  NorthCape  they came hither according to their Instructions where casually meeting with  Ralegh  he held them together and conducted them to  Essex  at the Islands Otherwise they had all return'd home after they had failed at the  South Cape  which was the third and last MeetingPlace of some Admiral to command them and of whom they would have fail'd since none of the Fleet went so far southward  Soon after he had determin'd in Search of the  Fleet to pass on towards the  SouthCape  he was travers'd by an  English  Bark which assur'd him they had learn'd from an  English  Man of War which had lately taken an  Indiaman  that the  Adelantado  was gone for the Islands to convoy the  Indian  Fleet safe home This seeming very probable and no one suspecting that any of their Countrymen would traiterously delude her Majesty's Fleet with any false Informations in a Pursuit of this Consequence  Ralegh  earnestly besought the Captain of the said Bark to hunt after  Essex  and apprise him of this Intelligence But he answer'd in the hearing of the whole Company that the Captain who had taken that  India man  had already sent a Letter to  Essex  thereof  Ralegh  doubting it might have miscarried or that none was sent commanded one of the small Men of War attending upon himself with all Diligence to seek out the Fleet and make Report of what they had heard This Ship by good Chance met with the Fleet next Day and deliver'd the News Two Days after  Ralegh  received two Letters from  Essex  which somewhat taxing his Absence and not writing requir'd that he would presently follow him to the Islands  Whereunto the Earl said he was hasiening to find the  Adelantado  not doubting but to give his Mistress a better Account of that Service than he should yield his Master  In passing to the Islands  Ralegh  was so much in Danger of losing his Mainmast that he was forced to send the Ships in his Company before because he thought  Essex  might be in Want of them if he should meet the Enemy and if they had joined the Fleet without  Ralegh  who was princpially depended on in Case of any Engagement it would have strengthened the Misconstructions that had been nourished against him but  Ralegh  so speedily  and effectually repaired his crazy Mast and so briskly ply'd his Sails that he overtook his Consorts next Day and on the th of  September  they all made the Island of  Tercera  yet here could they meet with no News of the Fleet though they enquired of an  English  Merchant who had traded about these Islands above six Weeks and though it had passed that Way but two Days before By this Merchant  Ralegh  wrote into  England  to acquaint the State in what Situation they were then passed on to  St George  's Island where they found the Weather exceedingly hot and were vexatiously becalm'd for a Day or two before they could get forward to  Gratiosa  Here as they coasted along on the th of  September  about Midnight they saw a large and perfect Rainbow by Moonlight in the S  ape and Bigness of those formed more commonly by the Sun tho' in Colours not so various but chiefly inclining to a pale or whitish Flame This made the Generality of the Seamen expect some extraordinary tempestuous Weather but it fell out on the contrary to be very calm and hot  This Rainbow by the Light of the Moon is the rather to be observed because  Pliny  in his Natural History speaking of Meteors denies any Rainbow to be seen but opposite to the Sun and never in the NightSeason yet tells us  Aristotle  reports for a Rarity that in his Time there was a Nocturnal Rainbow seen but withal that it could only be at the Full of the Moon Nevertheless in these Parts they are very ordinary as well when the Moon is not at Full as otherwise for no longer than a Week after this Time  Ralegh  and his Company observed another lunary Rainbow as they rode at Anchor before  Flores  and there could not be two full Moons in seven Days which makes it probable these Islands were not known to the  Greeks  and  Romans  or those Meteors not sufficiently observed by them  The same Night they also espied by the Light of the Moon then upon the Border of the Horison some Sail of Ships gliding towards the East of  Gratiosa  at which  Ralegh  hung out two Lights for his Company to follow him in Chase of them but they not taking his Course and the Moon being soon after quite shadow'd and intercepted by the Earth he was left in Darkness and Solitude having lost all Sight both of the newdiscovered Ships and those of his own Company till in the Space of four Days more a leisurely Breeze of Wind brought him after all these Impediments to the rest of the Fleet then gathered at the Isle of  Flores  As soon as  Ralegh  had descry'd the Fleet he took his Barge and with Sir  Arthar Gorges  as also some other of the Officers and Gentlemen in his Company went aboard the Earl of  Essex  's Ship with whom they all  n'd and  "who seemed says  Gorges  to be the joyfullest Man living for our Arrival"  protesting that  "he never believed we would leave him altho' divers persuaded him to the contrary" and acknowledg'd that he was sor  for a Letter which he had written by Mr  Robert Knolles  into  England  against us promising presently to make a Dispatch on Purpose contrary to the Former"  Further when  Essex  had fully satisfied himself that all the Transports and Victuallers which returned with  Ralegh  had not been inveigled away by him and how commendably he had thus drawn them to the Islands against their Inclinations being most of them in great Distress he open'd himself to him in a very amicable and communicative Manner He told him  how he had spent the Time of their Separation wholly in ranging the Seas to meet with the  Adelantado he acquainted him with  the many Conjectures and Surmises that had been vented of his Absence and withal named to him some of those Men who had taxed him secretly with strange Reports yet pretended to love him which he  protested he never believ'd but thereby the better observ'd their scandalous and canker'd Dispositions  In this Manner did the Earl of  Essex  receive and welcome Sir  Walter Ralegh  with the greatest Kindness and Familiarity as well as all the Gentlemen of his Company to the great Dislike and Heartburning of some who much envied that Liking which of his own Disposition  Essex  bore to  Ralegh For tho' the Earl had many Doubts and Jealousies buzz'd into his Ears against him yet I have often observ'd  says  Gorges that both in his greatest Actions of Service and in the Times of his chiefest Recreations he would ever accept of his Counsel and Company before many others who thought themselves more in his Favour  'Tis true the Earl of his own unperverted Nature was a Man prone to gracious and generous Principles but no less easily blown up to Prejudice and Indignation against his real Friends by his pretended ones whence we may conceive as Sir  Arthur Gorges  has well observ'd upon giving an Instance of his Moderation and Bounty to some of the Islanders  Tho' he was endowed with many good Gifts  how it came to pass that  he at last fail'd in the Use of them  Here as they lay before the Isle of  Flores  they held a Council of War to conquer and possess or lay waste some of these Islands they being the chief Places of Retreat and Refreshment for the King of  Spain  's  Indian  Fleets by the Treasures whereof his boundless Ambition so much disturbed and so tyranniz'd over  Europe  In this Council the Admirals and Commanders had their Charge allotted after the following Manner  Essex  and  Ralegh  were to undertake the Island of  Fayall  the Lord  Thomas Howard  and Sir  Francis Vere  were to secure  Gratiosa  the Lord  Mountjoy  and Sir  Christopher Blunt  were to attempt  St Michael  's and  the  Netherland  Squadron was quartered to  Pike  where grew the greatest Store of Wines therefore presumed no unwelcome Portion to them And these Places were the first resolved upon that they might afterwards attack the  Tercera  itself for  Ralegh  's Arrival gave their Resolution upon this stronger Island a second Life but it was first thought expedient to strengthen and supply themselves with whatsoever those weaker ones would afford And to this End the Fleet was divided into four Squadrons  But  Ralegh  's Mariners having obtained Leave to go ashore at  Flores  to water and furnish themselves with such other Necessaries as they wanted while he himself attended by several other of the Commanders and Gentlemen walked a Mile or two into the Island to stretch their Legs and refresh themselves where they all dined in a little Village the barelegged Governor having caused such Fare to be brought them as the Country afforded which they very honourably paid for without offering them the least Injury because the Earl had before given them an Indemnity under his own Hand from all Manner of Violence When  Essex  impatient to be in Action all of a sudden and before the Sailors could get their Casks of fresh Water aboard sent on the th of  September  Capt  Arthur Champernon  to tell them  That the General was borne up for  Fayall  meaning presently to take it in therefore required them to follow him instantly and though they should not overtake him yet to find him there as soon as they could and there they might supply their Wants  Hereupon they hastened away with all the Sail they could make after him but no General could they overtake The next Morning they got Sight of  Fayall  and miss'd of  Essex  also there to their great Dissatisfaction he being six Leagues  nearer that Island when he sent for them and set sail thither six or eight Hours before them  Being entered the Road they beheld before them a very fine Town pleasantly seated along the Shore from whence the People upon Sight of their Ships began to pack away both Bag and Baggage Their Friars Nuns other Women and Children they also sent away in Carts and Carriages so continued transporting all up into the Country for two Days together There was besides a strong Fort at one End of the Town and another on the Top of a very high Mountain near adjoining by Nature very inaccessible and artificially fenced with Flankers Rampier and a Ditch also six Pieces of Artillery and  Spaniards  in Garrison not reckoning others quartered about the Island They fired upon  Ralegh  's Ships as he anchored in the Road though without much Damage and set a great red Standard up in Defiance before his Eyes They sent moreover six Companies with their Colours to entrench upon the Shore in Order to oppose his Landing However  Ralegh  in his Barge accompanied with Sir  Arthur Gorges  and Captain  William Morgan  rowed close along the Shoreside and by the high Fort towards the Town to acquaint himself with the most proper Place for making a Descent when  Essex  should arrive from whence they were saluted with divers Musketshot which they very fortunately escaped having with them neither Targets nor Armour for their Safeguard  Upon these Provocations and the Want they grew in of those Necessaries wherewith they were both lately hurried from accommodating themselves and promised they should be supplied here  Ralegh  called a Council of the Captains and Officers to consult about taking of the Town if  Essex  arrived not thinking it a Shame to forbear so fair a Prize so  near at Hand 'till they had carried all off especially since the Enemy had begun the War upon them and so proudly dared them to their own Defence Further these Bravadoes with the Hopes of Wealth in this goodly Town▪ and the Ransom of Houses and Prisoners made all the Mariners and Soldiers not only ready to mutiny that they were so long restrained but reflect on their Commanders as if this Forbearance was the Effect only of their Fear And what made them the more eager was that they saw no Likelihood of other Benefit by this Voyage than what was thus to be gotten ashore Notwithstanding these Murmurs and that they heard no News of  Essex  in two Days the Council was divided and some of the Captains who were his most flattering and servile Dependants as Sir  Guilly Merrick  Sir  Nicholas Parker  and others were by no means for landing without his Knowledge but  Ralegh  with Sir  W Broek  Sir  A Gorges  Sir  W Harvey  and many other Commanders and Gentlemen of his own Squadron were of a contrary Opinion judging the General would repute them Idlers and Cowards to lie so long before so good a Town with so many Ships and Men and do nothing but let them convey away their Effects This was the general Voice both of the Land and SeaForces yet the violent Persuasions of  Merrick  did so prevail that they agreed to delay the Enterprize one Day longer when if the Earl did not come they all agreed to land together  Now the Wind tacking about somewhat unfit for the Road they lay in  Ralegh  and divers of his Squadron with many other of the Ships after him weighed and coasted about the the Point to the Northwest Side of the Island some four Miles further from the Town than they were before and there let fall their Anchors being a better Road  than the first as the Wind sat But  Merrick  with some five or six Ships of his Consorts would not advance with them They were now in the fourth Day of their Arrival before  Fayall  and no General appear'd but the Prospect of a most inviting Country full of little Villages and fruitful Fields which sharpen'd the general Desire of landing to supply their Want of Victuals and especially of Water wherewith they had not been recruited since their first setting out from  Plymouth  therefore by Agreement they mann'd out a Barge a LongBoat and Pinnace with Muskets and Pikes rather to guard themselves in watering than in Expectation of any Encounter from the Town or Forts on the other Side of the Island But they were no sooner ready to put off from the Ships than they discover'd six Ensigns of Foot and some dozen Horsemen marching down speedily from the Town and Forts to meet them and made such Haste that they soon possess'd the Trenches towards the Shore where the  English  lay and where with brandishing Swords and waving Colours they stood daring them to a Rencounter Hereupon  Ralegh  found it necessary to augment his Force which  Brook Harvey  and other SeaOfficers readily supply'd to the Number of Men more Then said  Ralegh  to them  Seeing these  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  are so gollant to seek or follow and keep us from watering we will try our Fortunes with them and either win our Landing or gain a Beating  As  Ralegh  then rowed along by his Ships he was greeted by  Bret Sidney White Berry  and other Captains of the  LowCountry  Soldiers who call'd out and advis'd him  to take them and some of their Companies with him for if he ventured to make the Shore only with Mariners and his own Attendants without their LandSoldiers  he might receive a discreditable Repulse  But  Ralegh  excus'd himself saying  he did not know for what Service the Earl might design them and therefore was resolv'd with his own Company to make the Descent and then should send for their Recruits by which he would undertake to lodge them that Night in the Town and the next in the Forts Besides he was willing to make the Attempt with those of his own Squadron that neither the General nor his Train should have Cause to be asham'd of them for undertaking that in the Face of their Enemies which they durst not of themselves follow and perform  Then  Ralegh  having thus a Party of Men not half the Number of the Enemy made forward and while some Ordnance he had judiciously placed before him in Pinnaces as close along the Shore as they could lie were beating upon their Trenches he rushed through or under them as fast as his Oars could ply to the Landingplace which was guarded first with a mighty Ledge of Rocks▪ Paces long into the Sea and afterwards trench'd and flank'd with Earth and Stone having only a narrow Lane between two Walls for their Entrance But now as they approached still nearer to the Shore the Enemies Shot flew down so thick upon them that not only several of the common Men but of those who would before have passed for very forward and valiant Leaders were much dismay'd insomuch that  Ralegh  who most gloriously approv'd himself no less their Chief in Courage than he was in Command did not spare openly to rebuke them aloud with many reproachful Words At last when he saw them still linger through Consternation as much to their Danger as their Disgrace he commanded with a loud Voice his Watermen to row his own Barge full upon the Rocks and bade as many as were not afraid to follow  him Hereat some Boats ran in with us says my Author and out of them were landed Mr  Garrett  then a Pensioner afterwards Earl of  Kildare  Sir  W Brook  Sir  W Harvey  Sir  John Scott  Captain  Henry Thynne  Captain  White  Captain  Arthur Radford  Captain  W Morgan  Mr  Duke Brook  Mr  Thomas Rudgeway  Mr  Walter Chute  Mr  Henry Allen  Mr  Charles Mackart  and divers other Gentlemen So clambering over the Rocks and wading through the Water he made his Way pellmell through all their Fire with Shot Pike and Sword up to the narrow Entrance where he so resolutely pursued his Assault that the Enemy after a short Resistance gave Ground and when they saw his Forces press faster and thicker upon them suddenly retiring they cast away their Weapons and betook themselves to the Hills and Woods The like also did those who were intrench'd higher And thus did he win this difficult and dangerous Landing together with the Trenches of the Enemy A few of his Men indeed were drowned and slain more hurt and a couple of Longboats sunk yet was not his Loss so considerable as to detract from the Justice of those Congratulations which were paid him by the Officers of the  LowCountry  Forces when with some of their Companies they arrived upon the Island and found the Footing he had won so strongly fortified and guarded  Ralegh  thus recrulted being now near strong thought best to go through with the Matter and prepare the Town in Readiness for  Essex  Therefore he appointed  Bret  to the Office of SerjeantMajor directed the other Captains to advance their Colours marshal the Companies and so in order marched to the Town about four Miles distant from the LandingPlace In their Passage  divers of the Enemy who had before braved them with the greatest Insolence came with white Napkins at the End of Staves and voluntarily abased themselves to Offices of the greatest Servility There was indeed a Way two Miles about by which they might have passed to the Town and avoided the high Fort where the  Spaniards  lay in Garrison But  Ralegh  considering the Trouble of their March the sultry Heat of the Weather the Hazards of Delay and above all the Necessity they were under of immediate Supplies took the shortest Course resolving to bring Fort and Town all into one Days Work Thus at the Head of about Gentlemen of the best Rank  Ralegh  led on the Companies in a gentle regular Manner full in the Face of the Fort having only his LeadingStaff in his Hand and no other Armour on but his Collar for which he was somewhat censur'd by his Friends for when they came within Reach of the Fort they were shrewdly encounter'd with several fierce Storms of great and small Shot which came thundering down upon them from all Parts of it wounding several  Among the rest there was one Captain  William Morgan  a brave old Soldier in this March who being reproved by our Author Sir  A Gorges  for coming to the Field only in his Doublet and Hose without either Armour or Target answer'd  That his Flesh was of Musket Proof  Immediately after a Musket Ball struck him pointblank upon his Belly and with the Force of its own Blow fell flat at his Feet leaving only a black Spot or Bruise upon his Skinthanks to the Buckle that join'd his Girdle deserving to be reposited among those Trophies in the Temple of  Mars  which Witness he wants not one Brother Soldier's impenetrable Suit of Mail nor the sevenfold Shield of another who can encounter his Enemy behind the Curtains only of a Pair of Proverbs attesting  How little Armour will suffice that is wellplac'd  and  How much Fortune favour the bold  killing some and putting most of his Men into Disorder Insomuch that  Ralegh  himself with his  little Vanguard was no sooner passed and enter'd under the Covert of their Trenches and Barricadoes at the Declivity of a little Hill but the rest composing the main Body of his Forces which 'till now that they found themselves under the Mercy of the Enemies Fire advanced in good Order begun to break their Ranks and from marching fell to running on in a straggling and confused Manner 'till they were under the Walls and Trenches almost as soon as their Leader who came some twelvescore Yards before them in a steady and deliberate March  Ralegh  was somewhat moved to see this tumultuous and timorous Course and more to think that the Enemy saw themselves were the Occasion of it therefore he cried out to  Bret Berry  and other Captains demanding  If these were the Men that should have done him such Service in Landing and saved him from Dishonour Or this the Manner of their  LowCountry  Troops to shew such base Cowardice at the first Sight of an Enemy and at the Musketshot so far off from a Fort  The Captains who were themselves brave enough knowing the Truth would be the best Apology answered  That these Companies who had behaved themselves with such Irresolution were indeed Men taken out of  Flushing  and  Brill  the cautionary Towns so were raw Soldiers who had ever lived in a safe Garrison and seldom or never seen an Enemy or encountered with Shot in the Field  Being thus got under Covert of the Trenches and Walls which the  Spaniards  had abandoned and retired to their Fortifications on the Top of the Hill  Ralegh  commanded Capt  Bret  to appoint a Serjeant or two with a few Shot to go view and discover the Way to the Town which in many Places lay open as well to the high Fort here in the Way towards it as to the other Fort at the End  thereof And where the Ways were fenced they were still more dangerous it being with lowpiled Walls of looseragged Stones which  Ralegh  justly suspected would increase rather than obstruct the Mischiefs of their Enemies Artillery  Bret  brought Word of a general Unwillingness in the Lieutenants and Serjeants to undertake this Discovery so much under the Command of the Fort and Hill and that the Troops were rather desirous of slipping by in the most hasty dispersed and unobserved Manner they could which  Ralegh  would by no Means suffer through Consideration of their Safety without urging the Regard he had to their Credit in this Enterprise for being by this Time wellinformed the Island could raise armed Men and reasonably believing they would gather their greatest Strength for the Defence of their best Town towards which he was now marching he concluded they would have it more in their Power to defeat him advancing in little disorderly and scattered Parties than in a regular united Body  Bret  did make some Offer himself to go and survey these Passages if he should be expresly commanded but indeed it was found he could not be wanted or spared among his own raw and unexperienced Troops  When  Ralegh  therefore saw all Men so scrupulous of this Undertaking and especially those GarrisonSoldiers he told them  That he would not offer that to any Man which he would himself refuse That though it were not the Duty and Office of a chief Commander to undergo so ordinary a Service but what duly appertained to the inferior Officers and Soldiers and notwithstanding said he that I could therefore enforce others to do it they shall well perceive that I myself will do that which they dare not attempt wherein I am ashamed on their Behalf that our General  and we are thus abused in our Opinion of these  LowCountry  Soldiers Then he called for his Cuirass and his Cask and said he would both go view the Way for them which they made so nice of as also the Passages and Ascents to the Hilltop and as well as he could observe the Strength and Fortifications thereof for their better Direction the next Morning Hereupon Capt  Berry  was very ready to go and earnestly desired me says our Author to divert our Rearadmiral from undertaking it and I thereupon continues he did openly dissuade him who commanded in chief from putting his own Person to these inferior Offices of Hazard fitter for a Lieutenant or Serjeant than himself to perform knowing that all the Direction as well of those Troops as also of a whole Squadron of the Navy did at that Time only rest upon him in the Absence of the Admiral and Viceadmiral Notwithstanding he was obstinate therein as well in scorn of those who had refused as also indeed out of a Desire to be better informed of the Strength and Fortifications of the high Fort When I saw him resolved I told him that I would out of the Love of a Kinsman in particular and also out of an honest Regard take such Part as he did from whom I had received many kind Favours and accompany him but not out of any great Desire I had to go about a Piece of Work which consisted of much Danger and little Honour in the Performance He thanked me for my offer but yet wished me not to go if it were against my Will Notwithstanding I accompanied him and so did some eight or ten more of our Servants and Followers But I say truly and so afterwards it was much spoken of that there was not any one more of Quality that did accompany him in that Business  In this Manner and with this Number did  Ralegh  in Person go the only one it seems who  despaired not of Success to discover the Ascents to the Hill the Cannon shot of the Enemy and thereby the Stones of the battered Walls flying on every Side thick about him all the while He still proceeded with an undaunted Pace to compass this Knowledge of the safest Way by which he was to lead the Rest though he perceived Wounds and Death dealt on either Hand and his own Danger at every Step more unavoidable Some of his Company in the March were hurt and two had their Heads taken from their Shoulders Sir  Arthur Gorges  had his left Leg shot through with a Musketball who without remembering any Pain it gave him observes the Bullet burnt both his silk Stocking and Buskin as if they had been singed with a hot Iron  I was then hard by the Rearadmiral continues he who also was shot through the Breeches and Doubletsleeves in two or three Places And still they plied us so fast with small Shot that as I well remember he wished me to put off a large red Scarf which I then wore being as he said a very fair Mark for them But I not willing to do the  Spaniards  so much Honour at that Time though I could have wished it had not been on answered the Rearadmiral again That his  white  Scarf was as eminent as my  red  and therefore I would now follow his Example  Having by this Time made a sufficient Discovery both of the Way for his Troops to pass as also of the Avenues to the high Fort on the Mountain which he intended to attempt after he had secured the Town Capt  Berry  with  Allen  and some others advanced to him Hereupon he sent some Guides to Capt  Bret  with Orders for him also to march up with the Companies that they might unite before they came to the Town because he there expected an Engagement or at least  some Salley out of the Fort at the End thereof which they must needs pass before they could get at the Town and which seemed to threaten Resistance being a very fine Fortification all of stone Work with Curtain Flankers and Ditch very artificially cast But immediately upon  Ralegh  's Approach with the Body of his Men the  Spaniards  it seems abandoned it for when he entered it he found they were newly departed In like manner as he marched on he found the Inhabitants had also forsaken the Town and left him in Possession of it with such Wares and Stores as could not suddenly be removed Thus though with much Danger indeed and some Loss of about half a score Men with the Hurt of little above double that Number  Ralegh  made himself Master in effect of the whole Island which supplied him from his own Experience with an Example to confirm the Assertion he afterwards took Occasion to maintain and which we have in Part touched upon before alledging  That a Country cannot prevent an Enemy's Fleet from landing its Army without as good a Fleet to oppose it  And this Example in his own summary Account we have here subjoined as what may give the Reader a double Satisfaction both in confirming the Veracity of that which has been here extracted thereof from Sir  Arthur Gorges  and adding to the many other Instances of  Ralegh  's Modesty and Restriction who could in the Recital of this Action be so much less particular in the brave Steps he took to this Victory with the Dangers and Difficulties he surmounted by Sea and Land than that honourable Historian has been who was a Witness of them  This Town of which  Ralegh  was thus possess'd was called  Villa Dorta  as I find in  Linscthoen  who also informs us the People were mostly of the  Dutch  Offspring yet using the  Portuguese  Language Others who likewise describe it reckon that it contained even some Years before this Time at least Houses built all of Sone with tiled Roofs and disposed into fine Streets besides a handsome Church Nunnery and Friery interspersed with many pleasant Gardens of delicate Fruits and Wells of fresh Water insomuch that for Bigness it has been compared to  Plymouth  or  Yarmouth  but in Situation to  Dover  and might probably now have been of as good Advantage to Sir  Walter Ralegh  as it was eight Years before to the Earl of  Cumberland  had he not in compliment to the Earl of  Essex  obliged himself to so disadvantageous a Delay in the Conquest of it However because the Town was unwall'd and he was to expect if he lay there open and carelesly refreshing himself while his Soldiers were scatter'd about in quest of Provisions he might easily be surpriz'd without some good Orders and Directions given before they fell to Rest and Repast he issued forth at his Entrance a Proclamation that none should straggle twentyscore Yards from the Town without leave of an Officer and then go upon their Guard with fit Weapon and Company He then made some strong Barricadoes planted a good Watch in proper Stations and a strong  corps de garde  in the Marketplace that others might in Safety bring together such Booty as the Inhabitants had left behind  Thus having refreshed and reposed themselves all Night the next Morning being the d of  September  even before break of Day they discover'd bearing with full Sail towards the Road of  Fayal  the Earl of  Essex  and his Fleet he having been all this while making a kind of Wildgoose Chase after  Indian  Fleets and the  Adelantado  who it  seems never stirr'd out to Sea this Year with other like uncertain Adventures Now Sir  Guilly Merrick  Sir  Christopher Blount  Sir  Anthony Shirley  and some other fatal Friends and Cherishers of the Earl's Infirmities soon interrupted by their aggravating and distorted Representations all  Ralegh  's further Intentions to secure the Island They presently possessed his Lordship's Head that  Ralegh  had taken this Opportunity to play over his Parts and shew the World how well he could act the Conqueror only to steal Honour and Reputation from the General they knew the Earl's Temper was as ready as Tinder to catch Fire at the least Suggestion For as no Man alive was a more passionate Courtier of Fame or more desirous to be reputed matchless for Magnanimity and Enterprize so none was more jealous of Rivals than  Essex  or could less endure that any Man should obscure his Glory how highly soever he might otherwise be in his Favour But in divers other disagreeable Colours this gallant Action was further disfigur'd to the Earl as the Contempt and Violation of Authority from whence they infus'd that the Presumption of landing such Forces without his Lordship's Leave was not to be passed over without severe Punishment and that it was fit a Court Martial should be call'd to censure the Offence and Breach of Order and Discipline In short the unpardonable Crime was that  Raleigh  dared to render himself more conspicuous than any Body else And he had been less culpable had he been less successful they seeming rather willing to have endured Blame for any ill Success which might have occur'd to him by their Absence and Restraint of Aid than allow of any Praise for his being victorious without them Nay there were not wanting some among  Essex  's Commanders who would needs shew the Volence  of their Zeal for his Lordship in such Extreams as to throw out that  Ralegh  was well worthy of losing his Head for his Labour All which might well inspire those solid and durable Exposures which he has in several Places made of such envious and insolent Usage  Essex  thus exasperated spent all the Forenoon in reprehending displacing and confining all the Land Captains and Officers who accompanied  Ralegh  whilst he expecting rather Thanks than such a perverse Interpretation of his Services made ready his Barge to go on board the General and guide him to Land But being entered his Ship he found all Mens Countenances estranged as he passed through them and when he came to his Cabin the Earl after a faint Welcome began to accuse him with  the Breach of Orders and Articles Ralegh  answered  he knew not wherein he had been guilty of such a Breach Essex  replied  there was an Article that none should land any of the Troops without the General's Presence or his Order Ralegh  desired leave to defend himself by those Laws which himself as well as others had made and his Lordship with the Council of War had authoriz'd then he should find that no Misdemeanor had been committed  For said he there is an Article indeed that no Captain of any Ship or of any Company if he be separated from the Fleet shall land any where without Direction from the General or some other principal Commander upon Pain of Death But I take my self said  Ralegh  to be a principal Commander under your Lordship and therefore not subject to that Article nor under the Power of the Martial Law because a successive Commander of the whole Fleet in her Majesty's Letters Patents your Lordship and my Lord  Thomas Howard  failing Besides you agreed I should land at this Island with you Lordship  whom I have attended these four Days and finding that you came not though your were half a Dozen Leagues before me in your Way thither I weighed Anchor and could not but conclude both that you thought me strong enough to take this Island and were gone yourself to take in some others Yet I refrained so long from landing at Sir  Guilly Merrick  's Entreaty that I heard my own Company even at my Back murmur and say that I durst not attempt it And to tell you the plain Truth my Intent at first was only to water till I saw them follow me in that braving Manner which with our Reputations we could not then shun and give over being already in our Boats for that Purpose For if I had intended the taking of the Town I would never have removed so far from our first Road which lay right before it  As for those Officers and Gentlemen who had been committed  Ralegh  desired  "they might receive no hard Measure in his Cause whatsoever his Lordship conceived to be misdone he he must take it wholly on himself to answer being at that Time Commander in chief  With these and other Arguments  Essex  was so well pacified that he went ashore into the Town and rested himself in  Ralegh  's Lodging There  Ralegh  invited him to supper and offered if he meant to call the Matter further in Question to claim no Privilege or Favour but would answer for himself more amply in the Morning Sir  Christopher Blount  taking the Earl's Answer from him said  he thought my Lord would not sup at all  To which  Ralegh  reply'd  That for his own appetite he might when he was invited disable it at his own Pleasure but if the Earl would stay he should be glad of his Company  In the mean Time the Lord  Thomas Howard  very nobly taking Care that no disrespectful Treatment should  be offered to  Ralegh  by the Practice of his Enemies dealt with  Essex  to find how he stood resolved and the next Morning assured  Ralegh  that his Lordship sought only some Acknowledgment because the rest would think him a weak and tame Commander if he had not Satisfaction  Ralegh  considering he had done nothing unjustifiable and very certain that he was successively in the Commission for the whole Command of the Fleet therefore not subject to any corporal Danger as also of the Lord  Thomas Howard  's sincere and honourable Dealing came again in the Morning to visit  Essex  Otherwise remembring the little Trust that Men ought to repose in such Reconciliations and the strong Malice borne him by others in greatest Favour with his Lordship had designed to betake him to his own Squadron and so to have defended himself or forsaken the Earl But the Lord  Thomas  after having given his Honour with great Kindness and Resolution that he would make himself a Party if any Wrong or Violence were offered contrary to his Lordship's Promise persuading him to go and satisfy the Earl  Ralegh  took his Counsel and all Things after a little Debate came to a calm and quiet Conclusion  The Promoters of this Disturbance however thus disappointed of their End scrupled not to share in the Benefits of this reproved Victory by lodging and refreshing themselves not only that Night but three or four Days after in the goodly Town aforesaid yet were they justly punished for their Envy and Ingratitude For had that Time which they spent in carping and cavilling at  Ralegh  's Conduct throughout this brave Action been employed according to his Measures in pursuing it the Birds which thereby they suffered to fly out  of their Cage had well rewarded their Unanimity in taking them and they would not have lost as now they had the Ransom of so many  Spanish  Prisoners out of the high Fort nor the Spoil which they had conveyed out of the Town for Safety to that Place So that instead of Assistance to advance the Profit of this Conquest  Essex  's Arrival brought only Means as far as in them lay to destroy the Honour of it  After the Army had plentifully regaled themselves with the best Provisions the Island would afford and the disgraced Captains were receiv'd again into Favour and Command they hoisted sail having first in Honour of their lost Men made the Town itself their funeral Pile and carried all the Artillery and other Stores they found therein or in their Forts to their Ships On the th of  September  they cast Anchor at  Graciosa  where the Chiefs of the Island coming on board the General submitted themselves with very acceptable Humiliation and willingly brought such Provisions as were required for their Composition This Homage of those People banished all Thoughts in the Earl of further repairing in that Place the great Charges he principally had created by this Voyage for he seemed so charmed with Submission as to have disregarded the Advantages it might have yielded and fonder of having a Power over his Enemies than of making any effectual Use of it When they came to  St Michael  's they heard Tidings of the  Indian  Fleet at which most joyful Acclamations rung through all their Ships within few Hours after they encounter'd and took three  Spanish  Prizes bound from the  Havanna  The greatest of them being about Tons burden was a very rich Ship as well for the Lading  as the Passengers in her and this if not the other two was taken by  Ralegh  who being nearest gave Chace caused her to strike and to yield These three Ships especially the last were laden with Cocheneal and other profitable Merchandize besides the Silver Gold Pearl Civit Musk Ambergrease found among the Passengers and acknowledged by the Merchants in them to be richly worth above Ducats When  Ralegh  had enquired from the Gallery of his own Ship of those who had computed the Value of these Commodities and been satisfy'd it would at least amount to that Sum he said  Although we shall be little the better for these rich Prizes yet I am heartily glad for our General's Sake because they will in great Measure give Content to her Majesty so that there may be no repining against this poor Lord for the Expence of the Voyage  These Ships made a Discovery of forty Sale of  Spanish Indiamen  whereof some were freighted with the King of  Spain  's Treasure and it was reported that while three or four of the  English  Fleet which were fallen among them were rifling one that foundered the rest escaped and recovered the  Tercera Essex  upon this Mischance called a Council of War and some of the Colonels with other Land Officers made liberal Professions of the daring Feats they would attempt if Boats Pinnaces and Men were allowed how vain and impracticable soever they seem'd to the Sea Commanders For they offered with Men to take both that Island and the Forts but these knowing the Difficulty of landing them with their Artillery on so dangerous a Place in so bad a Season besides the Strength of the Fortifications so well furnish'd by this new Arrival could not cordially and seriously give their Consent but urged many Reasons to the contrary yet when the Lord  Thomas  Howard  perceived this Incompliance would be used as a Handle at home for their losing the  Spanish  Fleet and Treasure he told  Essex  that if he was so forward to have it attempted both himself and Sir  Walter Ralegh  were ready to venture as far as any of them and that they would undertake to spare able Men out of the Fleet for the Service but this second Offer thus absolutely and solemnly made though of double the Number cool'd their Courage upon a little Deliberation who had made even the first and so the Vapour was dispelled  Hence they returned again to  St Michael  's  Island  which they had left upon the Intelligence aforesaid and in this Road  Essex  with a great Number of his Officers coming on Board  Ralegh  's Ship hung out the Flag of Council wherein they considered about landing and taking of the fair Town which lay so temptingly before their Eyes being unwalled and having but a slight Fort for its Defence by the Seaside  Essex  was for landing all the Companies immediately but  Ralegh  desired that himself might first go and survey the Place because the Billows were here in some Parts no less dangerous than where he had made the Experiment at  Fayal  The Earl at first consented but as  Ralegh  was putting off  Essex  standing in his Gallery with Sir  Christopher Blount  called him back in great Haste and said he would go himself As he was descending into his Barge  Ralegh  seeing him altogether unarmed except with his Collar and Sword called aloud to him and  desired him to take his Cosk and Target of Proof with him if he designed to approach the Shore seeing so many Muskets above    lying there on the Rest to oppose him  But  Essex  answered  That he would have none because he disdained to take any Advantage of the Watermen  who rowed him  for which our Author censures him  'In my Opinion says  Gorges  though that Answer much shewed his Valour yet became it not the Place that my Lord held For in Truth a General ought not to be so adventurous and careless of himself upon every slight Occasion nor to go unarmed to Places of imminent Peril  Homer  describes the valiant Heroes and brave Leaders of the  Greeks  to be best armed as  Achilles Ajax  cInsomuch that their very Arms are famous to these Days the Use whereof we make now scornful But they are no beaten Soldiers in the Wars who held these Opinions for it is truly said  That a great and wise General should die old  and I have read that  Epaminondas  was fined by his Countrymen the  Tbebans  for being too forward and serving in a Battle unarmed though he won the Victory'  as he had before done Sir  Walter Ralegh  However in viewing of those landingPlaces  Essex  and his Officers kept cautiously enough beyond the Reach even of Culverinshot therefore no such Temerity in leaving the Armour behind Thus after many Offers and Surveys made aloof says  Gorges  the Conveniencies of that Place for landing were excepted against  This Descent being thus disliked it was resolv'd that  Ralegh  should with all the great Ships lie as near before the Town of  St Michael  as he could to keep them in continual Alarm while  Essex  in a Pinnace of  Ralegh  's called the  Guiana  with about Men in Boats should by Night convey themselves about six Miles further than their first determined landing to the Town called  Villa Franca  Accordingly they all landed the next Morning at this Town without any Manner of Resistance while the Fleet kept the other in such constant Dread and Confusion that they could not regard their Neighbours to the End that the  English  Army having secured those might the better fall on the Back of these But in vain did the Fleet look over the Hills and Plains in expectation of them for that other pleasant Town of  Villa Franca  had so enchanted the Army being full of Fruits Wines and fresh Victuals that the Commanders as well as their Soldiers were content there to take up their Quarters without further Thoughts of  St Michael  's Town and for six Days together lay feasting and carrying on Board the Wheat Salt Woad and other Merchandize into certain private Mens Ships that followed the Fleet for such Purposes While  Ralegh  lay thus at Anchor there came into the Road a Ship of  Brasil  laden with the Woods of that Name and of  Fernambuc  with Sugars as well as other Merchandize and anchored full in the Midst of the  English  Fleet This Ship as Sir  Francis Vere  also informs us was taken by Sir  Walter Ralegh  and her Cargo when brought into  England  was very faithfully disposed of by our Author  Gorges  to defray the Expences of all the Men in  Ralegh  's own Ship to the Number of reckoning Soldiers as well as Mariners Soon after a huge Carrack of Ton Burthen and infinite Wealth says  Gorges  being laden with the Riches of the East and West came bearing in with all her Sails also among them whom she mistook for the  Spanish Armada For the King of  Spain  's Men of War when he made Fleets were compounded of Shipping of divers Nations and therefore more difficultly distinguished from ours  Sir  Walter Ralegh  in his Discourse touching a War with  Spain  and our Protection of the  Netherlands  has discovered many other Disadvantages in the  Spanish  Fleets of these Times through this Medley of Shipping whereof they were composed as the Diversity of Conduct and Swiftness in them whereby they could not either assail or defend in gross as the  English  or  Dutch  could Also the Confusion among their Mariners of so many different Countries and consequently Languages so as not to understand Directions and take them in general or even mistake them to the Loss of their Ship Besides being of such strange Nations unconcerned in the Quarrels they were forced into they fought with their Hands but not their Hearts and desired Liberty rather than Victory See  Ralegh  's  Three Discourses  vo p    which at that  Time consisted of  English  and  Holland  Bottoms besides a great Galleon before named and other  Spanish  Vessels they had taken  At Sight of this Carrack  Ralegh  gave Orders throughout his Fleet to take in all their Flags also that none should weigh Anchor fire a Gun or put off a Boat without Leave But as she was bearing in one of the  Holland  Squadron contrary to Direction and to an Discretion suddenly weighed Anchor hoisted Top Sail and as she approached made two or three Shot at her whereupon perceiving her Mistake she nimbly changed her Course at which Instant the Wind changing also so that he could not escape outwards  "she with the Help thereof and with the Fear of falling into our Hands says  Gorges  run herself a ground close under the Town and Fort  Here finding  Ralegh  follow her and her Danger inevitable she discharged her Men in the Boats that flock'd about her with some of her Wares and was then instantly set on fire in many Places at once  Ralegh  and his Men still pursued to board her and prevent her loss though not without great Danger in his Rowbarge as he was the Surge being very outragious but by then he could get up to her she was all over Thunder and Lightning her Ordnance discharging from every Port and her whole Hulk Masts Cordage and Furniture sunk overrun with such a thorough yet distinct and unconfus'd Blaze as represented the Figure of a Ship more perfectly in Fire than could be done by any Painter with all his Art and Colours and when she was consumed even to the Surface of the Water she exhaled as her last  Breath such Clouds from her spicy Entrails as for a great Way and for many Hours perfumed the Air and Coast around Had the Army then been at  St Michael  's Town as was expected it might have secured this Ship before she could have disembarked her Men or if it had terrified her back to Sea she must have been taken by the Fleet and then the Treasures she contained with those in this Town might probably have reimbursed the Charges of their Voyage since our Author laying this Loss upon the said LandForces thought it so much to be lamented that they were not to be excused  Neither  Essex  nor his Army being heard of in all this Time  Ralegh  was in a Consultation about drawing up the Fleet towards him when he perceived the Earl's Ship by her Flag turning out from the Point of  Villa Franca  Then  Ralegh  taking Capt  Morgan  in his Barge rowed to him and the same Night sent the Captain back with Directions in the General's Name to command all the Fleet to weigh and come to that Town It much grieved the Mariners to see the unprofitable Measures which were thus taken and that they must relinquish the Advantages they might have made of the Town before which they lay When the Fleet was got up to the Army at  Villa Franca  a general Command was given that all the Companies should repair to their respective Ships for the Time of Year approached that the Winds and Waves began to rise too high for them to ride on those Coasts any longer So they left this Town also entire upon what Considerations our Author knew not but thought the Woadmongers and CornMerchants might be most likely to resolve the Question  On the th of  October  they set sail for  England  and after three or four Days were violently toss'd about and dispers'd in a most tempestuous Sea  Ralegh  's Ship was near being stemm'd by the Shock she received from another that was driven against her whereby she became so leaky that he had much ado to keep her above Water He was further in such great Distress for Want of Drink that Sir  Arthur Gorges  proffer'd one of the Victuallers six Chests of Sugar for six Hogsheads of fresh Water but could not obtain it Insomuch that they were forced to set their great Stills on Work to furnish themselves in the best Manner they could During this Storm 'tis also observed many Sorts of Birds flew into his Ship and the Dove that came among them was look'd upon to presage the Calm that ensued two Days after When they began to meet again they descry'd at a great Distance the Earl of  Essex  accompanied with only two little Barks who about a Week before was attended with Sail of good Ships  After hailing and saluting one another they consulted with their Masters and Pilots about the best Course homewards wherein they of  Ralegh  's Ship varied much from those who guided the Earl's And tho'  Essex  had the Directions of  John Davis  a Navigator of much Experience and Repute who could have carried them without Error to any distant Parts of the World yet in conducting the Ships home to their own Coast did he strangely fail in his Pilotage and Conjecture for the  Sleeve  However all follow'd the Admiral and when he thought he was not far from the Entrance of the Channel all Hands fell to sounding for Ground and at last found it tho' indeed  I saw few the wiser thereby  says our Author  or the  more assured of the Coast  This Sounding of ours so much in Practice continues Sir  Arthur Gorges  and yet many Times bringing no great Certainty makes me call to mind an odd Conceit and Speech of a  Spanish  Prisoner which the General gave me in this Journey He was a Gentleman a Soldier and of late Years traded to the  WestIndies  With whom I one Day talking and discoursing of their Voyages wherein he was very well experienc'd he told me that in their Navigation from the  Indies  they sought out  Spain  in a more certain and gallant Manner than we did  England  For said he  'We seek out our Coast aloft with our Eyes by the Heavens by the Sun or Stars and with the Use of Art and Instruments which seldom or never fails But you said he that seek for  England  when you are forced to run into narrow Seas are forced for your surest Directions like Men blindfold to search under the Water and scrape with Lead and Tallow to the Bottom for Banks Sands and Shallows as if you would rake Hell for Instructions to find out the Channel which you call the  Sleeve  and yet for all your Soundings are oftentimes mistaken' I answer'd him Indeed it was true that our Humility taught us to go by the Ground whereas their Pride led them to gaze above the Clouds and thereby so dazzled their Eyes that they often stumbled upon those Men of War which now used as well to sound the  Spanish  Pocket as the  English  Sleeve'  exeept the skilful Master of  Ralegh  's Ship old  Broadbent  who knew it to be the Banks  of Scilly But there was no convincing of  Essex  so all followed his erroneous Light yet  Ralegh  kept at some Distance behind all Night long At Break of Day tho' it was close and foggy he perceived how providentially he had escaped Destruction in the dark and dangerous Passage he had made close by those fatal Rocks call'd the  Bishop  and his  Clerks  Soon after he also discerned  Essex  and many with him about three Leagues before bearing in with all their Sail NorthEast instead of East and by North full upon the Sands of the  Welsh  Coast on which in that gloomy Weather he had certainly stuck and perish'd had he held on a little longer and had not Sir  A Gorges  who was then upon the latter Watch  Ralegh  being retired to rest forced the Mastergunner of his Ship to discharge a Warningpiece three or four Times much against his Will and that of the Master himself who contrary to all Duty and Humanity  said they deserv'd to taste the Peril of their own Wilfulness having brought themselves and all the Fleet clearly out of their Way into such Danger  Upon this Admonition  Essex  with all his Train soon tack'd about and afterwards confess'd his Error With much ado they beat up to double the Cape of  Scilly  and enter'd the  Sleeve Ralegh  by this Time was shot along the Northside of  Cornwall  for his Ship was so crazy and his Provisions so scanty he durst not put again to Sea but stood along the Coast and that Night anchor'd before  St Ives  where he found the  Cornish  People all in Alarm several  Spanish  Caravals and Flyboats which lay there having made some Descents by Stealth and put them into great Fright and Confusion For  Essex  because he met not with the  Adelantado  had both believed and reported into  England  that he never stirr'd out to Sea this Year whereas indeed while the Strength of the  English  Navy lay before the Islands he had set out with a puissant Fleet for the Invasion of  England  and these lesser Vessels which were sent before did here attend his Coming But that Storm which so roughly scatter'd the  English  dispersed this  Spanish Armada  utterly disabled for the intended Enterprize  Ralegh  arriving at this Juncture gave great Joy to this Part of the Kingdom and being landed he immediately took such Order for the Safeguard of the County whereof he was her Majesty's Lieutenant as soon dispell'd the Fears of its Inhabitants Then having supply'd his Ship  with proper Necessaries he sent her round to the Fleet and she was paid off at  Bristol  with the Profits that arose from one of the Prizes he had taken beforenamed Had as good an Account been given of the other Prizes this Expedition for all the Casualties and Oversights which happen'd in it would have return'd her Majesty double the Charge she had been at in setting it sourth  Ralegh  took his Journey to  Plymouth  where a Commission came down from the State to Lord  Thomas Howard  Lord  Mountjoy  himself and Sir  F Vere  with Monies for repairing victualling and sending about the Fleet to  Chatham  and for maintaining  LowCountry  Soldiers which were now quarter'd along the Coast of  Cornwall  and afterwards sent into  Ireland Essex  in the mean while posted away to  London  but whatever Advantage he might have in first shaping out the Story of their Adventures to the Queen it little avail'd him for Sir  Francis  soon after arriving also at Court understood his Lordship was retir'd to his House at  Wansted  in great Discontentment For the Queen was so incens'd against the Earl that she laid the whole Blame of their evil Success on his Lordship both for not burning and spoiling the  Spanish  Fleet at  Feroll  and missing that which came from  India Vere  says he justify'd his Lordship and laid the Blame upon those who deserv'd it with such Earnestness that the Standersby her Majesty then walking in the Garden at  Whitehall  might hear him Insomuch that he quieted the Queen as he tells us who then discoursed with him of the Earl's Humours and Ambition and at last construed all so graciously that she fell into Commendation of him so that he soon after came to Court But he staid not long there nor with any Ease or Content so insupportable  was it to find  Cecil  made Master of the Wards the LordAdmiral  Howard  created Earl of  Nottingham  for his Services against the  Spanish Invasion  and at  Cadiz  and now  Ralegh  's Actions at the Islands esteem'd also more considerable than his own tho' indeed by the fewer Number for the Populace were easily led to believe the late Disappointment of  Essex  's great Expectations was owing to  Ralegh  's Regard of his own Glory more than that of his Country whereby  Ralegh  lost their Opinion even tho' victorious against their Enemies while  Essex  was sure to return with Triumph however he miscarried in his Attempts and was always received by them with such Joy as if his great Fleets and Armies came laden with sufficient Spoil and Conquest if they only brought him safe home again Still both enjoy'd a liberal Share in the Queen's Favour but it only ratify'd the Veneration of the Multitude to one and their Disaffection to the other yet was their Esteem more fatal to  Essex  at least more speedily so than their Prejudice to  Ralegh  However the Queen was little influenc'd with their Partiality to either till  Essex  too zealously cultivated that which so unreasonably increas'd in his Favour for she loved her People without Jealousy nor was offended at his being the Darling of their Eyes till she found him inclin'd to be the Darling of their Hearts And as for the Blame which  Camden  says they now laid on each other of the late Misadventures and which he informs us grew to a more open Rupture it seems to have fallen most upon  Essex  and that  Ralegh  's Conduct was approv'd because  Essex  was never after trusted with the Command of any naval Expedition but  Ralegh  was Yet whatever Misconduct in others  Ralegh  might be now driven to object in his own Defence his Generosity to  Essex  and some of his Followers whom he might have laid it upon many Years after their Death when there was little Fear of being controverted is so much above most of theirs to him while they were alive that having then Occasion to mention this Voyage he does not drop the least  inuendo  against any of them but ascribes their Disappointments in it to the most unblameable Cause  Before  Ralegh  could well arrive I think at  London  to give an Account of this Expedition the Parliament was met at  Westminster  for we read that the Queen went thither in an open Chariot all cover'd overhead Canopywise with Silver Tissue and begun the Sessions on the th of  October  this Year  Ralegh  making but a short Stay in Town went to his Seat at  Sherbourn  of which he must have had but little Enjoyment for two or three Years past Towards the latter End of  November  following we find Mr  Adrian Gilbert  now a Burgess for  Bridport  in  Dorsetshire  obtain'd License of the Speaker that he might retire to his Brother Sir  Walter Ralegh  in that County for the Benefit of his Health About a Month afterwards that is on the th of  December  we meet with  Ralegh  in the House for what Place return'd I find not and that Day the Parliament was adjourn'd till the th of  January  When they met again  Ralegh  appears frequently in Committees upon several Bills of the greatest Consequences that were then read as that against lewd and wandering Persons pretending to be Soldiers or Mariners another for an Act to encrease People for the Service and Strength of the Realm one to explain an Act for the Maintenance of the Navy one for paying the Queen's Debts one for erecting Houses of Correction and Punishment of Rogues Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars besides  many others whose Titles are more proper to be sought in the Parliamentary Journals of this Reign than here barely to be recited For the Clerk of this House seeming to have melted down most of the Speeches in this Session for Brevity into a Narrative of its Proceedings little or nothing of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Arguments is to be particularly extracted  The Parliament being dissolv'd on the th of  February Ralegh  seems not to have resided long in Town for soon after some Regulations being made for the publick Good of those People over whom he presided by his Offices of Power in the  West  of  England  we find him celebrated for his Exercise thereof among them as a very worthy Patriot in several Instances The Lord  Burghley  is mention'd in one of them who died about six Months after the said Parliament broke up that is to say in  August  therefore we must here relate it as occuring before this Time It concern'd the Restoration of certain Manors to their antient Tenure in  Cornwall  for there are appertaining to that Dutchy which took or renew'd their Holdings as they call it every seven Years of certain Commissioners for near three Centuries past whereby the Tenants reckon'd a kind of inheritable Estate accruing to them But notwithstanding this long Prescription a bold and busy Person in these Times getting an ExchequerLease of one or two such Tenements called the whole Right in Question but failing of Success another soon after resumed the broken Title and prosecuted it even to a  Nisi prius  Hereupon the Tenants deputed certain Gentlemen among whom was the Author of this Passage  Richard Carew  of  Anthony  Esq one of the DeputyLieutenants of the County to repair to  London  with a Petition to the said LordTreasurer  Burghley  who calling to him the Chancellor and Barons of the Exchequer found besides this long Continuance and the Importance thereof as touching the Ruin of above Inhabitants that her Majesty possessed no Lands which yielded her so fair a Benefit as these in Rents Fines Heriots and other Perquisites These Reasons found favourable Allowance but did not procure an effectual Remedy till the said Gentlemen became Supplicants to her Majesty in Person who then having been prepared it seems by  Ralegh  's Applications and Interest testify'd her Dislike of the Attempter and expresly order'd the Cessation of his Attempt For says this Author herein we were beholden to Sir  Walter Ralegh  's earnest Writing who was then in the Country also to the Advice of Sir  Henry  and the Sollicitations of Mr  W Killegrew  Another Example of his zealous Affection for the Ease and Advantage of these People under his Jurisdiction appears in his lightning them of a certain burdensome Tax which carried many other Inconveniences with it For as the Products and Commodities in those  Western  Parts had been antiently very much oppress'd with Tributes to the Earls of  Cornwall  whereby the Condition of a  Cornish  Inhabitant and a  French  Peasant differ'd very little so latterly while  Ralegh  was Lieutenant of that County there wanted not some who through Favour at Court and plausible Representations to her Majesty did in Part revive the same and under Pretext of restoring a Rent decay'd ever since the Ninth of King  Henry  II to the pretended Detriment of the Crown procured Letters patent that none should salt dry or pack any Fish in  Devonshire  or  Cornwall  without their License or Warrant the ill Consequences whereof grew so apparent as being what would have made  that Patentee an absolute Disposer of all the  Western  Shipping and Traffick with their Sea and LandDependants that the  Cornish  Justices whereof Mr  Carew  aforesaid was one made Suit to the PrivyCouncil for Redress and  through the never failing Forwardness and Backing of Sir  Walter Ralegh obtain'd a Revocation thereof Here we may also add  Ralegh  's good Offices the two following Years for freeing the Inhabitants of these Parts from those heavy Impositions with which the Trade and Manufacture also of their Tinworks were very much embarrass'd These Impositions were occasion'd by the Merchants and Usurers who advanced Money to the Tinners upon whom their Encroachments were now grown so exorbitant that  Ralegh  was importun'd to revive the Privilege of  PreEmption  founded on that Clause in the Charter of King  Edward  I allowing them to vend their Tin to their best behoof  nisi nos ipsi emere voluerimus  It had been attempted by others before him who alledg'd many Reasons how it might prove advantageous not only to her Majesty but the Country and prejudicial to none but those Extortioners who practis'd a far worse kind of  PreEmption  'When any Western Gentleman says Mr  Carew  wants Money to cesray his Expences at  London  he resorts to one o  the Tin Merchants to borrow some but shall as soon wrest the Club out of  Hercules  's Fist as one Penny out of their Fingers unless they give Bond for every  l  so taken in Loan to deliver Pound Weight of Tin at the next Coinage which shall be within two or three Months or half a Year at farthest At which Time the Price of every thousand will not fail to be at least perhaps Pounds yea and after Promise made must be driven with some Indignity to make three or four Errands to his House before he shall get the Money deliver'd Thus some one Merchant will have Pounds out beforehand reaping thereby a double Commodity both of excessive Gain for his Loan and of Assurance of being serv'd with Tin for his Money This they say is no Usury forsooth because the Price of Tin is not commonly known before hand for once only within these Years on purpose to escape the Penalty of the Law they brought it a little under  l  the thousand but if to take above fifty in in the hundred be Extremity whatsoever Name you list to give it this in Truth can be no other than Cutthroat and abominable Dealing'  Survey of Cornwall  p b  But tho' this Means of Redress was  by those Persons hotly begun and a reasonable Price offer'd it soon cool'd again till it receiv'd a new Life in  Michaelmas  Term for then the  Cornish  Men being in  London  were call'd before the principal Lords of her Majesty's Council and the Matter was there debated by Sir  Walter Ralegh  in Behalf of the Country against those Advocates deputed for the Merchants who had promoted this Suit and he brought it to such a Conclusion that Articles were sign'd Indeed it did not immediately take Effect Yet it seems the Privilege was afterwards invested in  Ralegh  and that he put his Power in Execution In  November  the Year following he held a Court at  Lostwithiel  the usual Place for Stannary Causes where having signified her Majesty's Pleasure for a new Tax of six Pounds on every Thousand Weight of Tin that should be transported besides  l    s  already payable he told them also that her Majesty had been prevail'd on so far to disengage them from dealing with the Merchants and Usurers that she would disburse  l  in Loan to the Tinners for a Year's Space and was contented to be repaid in Tin And lastly what appears totally to have excluded those Merchants from the Exercise of their Impositions is that by the Time of the ensuing Parliament  Ralegh  appears to have had the Power of PreEmption granted him because in  a Speech of his having justly maintain'd his Title thereto from the Charter beforemention'd he yet no less generously offers to resign it as indeed he not long after voluntarily did if those who had Privileges of far less antient Establishment would follow his Example  But to return a little into the more open and publick Current of Action we must here observe that King  Henry  IV of  France  having about the End of the last Parliament informed the Queen of  England  by an Ambassador that he had held some Conferences with the  Spanish  Ministers about a Peace but would come to no Conclusion without her Consent and that of the United States her Majesty sent some Commissioners over And while they were negotiating this Business in  France  she had the Argument very closely debated in her Council at home Here  Essex  was one of those who would by no means listen to any Manner of Accommodation and while the Matter was upon the Carpet was so expeditious as to produce a formal Apology in Writing for his Reasons it being dated in and written before the King of  Spain  's Death in the Beginning of  September  the same Year Yet upon this Topic there ensued a warm Dispute says  Camden  between the Queen and  Essex  as also upon her chusing some able Minister to superintend the Affairs in  Ireland  She look'd upon the Earl's Uncle Sir  William Knolles  as a proper Person for that Charge  Essex  preferr'd Sir  George Carew  perhaps on Purpose says  Camden  to get rid of him And when the Queen would not be perswaded to approve his Choice he quite forgetting all Duty turn'd his Back upon her in a contemptuous Manner The Queen unable to bear his Insolence dismiss'd him her Presence with a Box on the Ear The Fury this threw  the Earl into is better conceiv'd than express'd but having with his Hand on his Sword told the Queen  He would not have taken such a Blow from her Father  he retired from Court The LordKeeper  Egerton  sent him a prudent and pacifying Letter in which among other wholsome Motives to Submission and Complacency he says  In this Course you hold if you have any Enemies you do that for them which they could never do for themselves while your Friends you leave to Scorn and Contempt  The Earl return'd a long and passionate Answer as  Camden  calls it in which it appears he had also suffer'd some Imprisonment and wherein he makes this Reply to those Objections  In this Course do I any thing for my Enemies When I was present I found them absolute and therefore I had rather they should triumph alone than have me attendant upon their Chariots Or do I leave my Friends When I was a Courtier I could sell them no Fruit of my Love and now I am a Hermit they shall bear no Envy for their Love to me  But the LordKeeper soon brought him out of his Hermitage and he was in a little Time readmitted into the Queen's Favour However his Friends according to  Camden  were apt to date his Ruin from this unlucky Circumstance And indeed it hence appears he had no Enemies so great or who so much conspired to his Fall as his own Passions his unreasonable Expectations of an absolute Conformity to his own Will and Impatience to behold any Body aspire to Distinction who did it not through his Patronage and Protection Of this he gave a most notorious Example about this Time in which he made  Ralegh  a publick Object of his Opposition tho' it ended in his own Disgrace and his Relapse into the Queen's Displeasure which he might have prevented had he kept his Word  to the Lordkeeper and suffered  Ralegh  to have triumphed alone for during this Reconciliation or last Blaze  Essex  made with any Credit at Court this memorable Contest seems to have been promoted by him at the martial Exercises performed on the Queen's Birthday which was the th of  November  These martial Exercises were the Justs or Turnaments wherewith the most active Nobles and Cavaliers of those Times celebrated the Queen's Birthday every Year in the  Tilt yard  near her Palace at  Whitehall  Here her Majesty was commonly herself a Spectator of them with her Attendants of both Sexes as likewise all the foreign Ambassadors and a numerous Concourse besides both of the Court and City History has not been very particular of  Ralegh  's Appearance at those Assemblies as by what Colour or Impresses he distinguished himself with what Success he ran the Carreers or what Favours he bore away But as upon all other publick Occasions he made a most rich and splendid Figure so we find upon these Days of Triumph none surpassed him in military Bravery I have somewhere read of his curious fine Armory and as I remember that Part of it is or was preserved in the  Tower  of  Lodon  but it is more apparent that probably for some of these grand Entertainments he either made himself or was presented by his royal Mistress with a Suit of Armour all of solid Silver For there are still in being not only ancient Paintings representing him about this Part of her Reign in that glittering and warlike Habiliment but mention is also made in some Writings of his being thus armed at all Points and shining in those polished Plates of Silver Yet who were his Competitors and what his Success in these robust Exercises there is little I fear remaining to satisfy us  more than those dark and dispersed Hints of that extraordinary Opposition or Contention which  Essex  raised against him about this Time as was observed And this being the Original or Copy of a like Contrivance practised not long before or after it in  France  by Marshal  Biron  as I remember to have read may from thence and the corresponding Testimony of an Author whose Credit and Intelligence are not to be doubted be presumed to have happened in the following manner  About the Time that  Essex  by other like Instances of his incurable Humour to monopolize the Multitude fell into or confirmed the Queen's Displeasure he had by some of his Followers learnt that Sir  Walter Ralegh  with a very gallant Train gorgeously accoutred was to make his Appearance the next Tilting day in Orange colour Plumes Hereupon  Essex  provided a much more numerous Cavalcade and decked them out exactly in  Ralegh  's Colours Then the Earl himself appearing at the Head of all armed  cap apee  in a compleat Suit of Orangecolour not only passed for the sole Knight or Champion of that Distinction by drowning all Distinction in Sir  Walter Ralegh  but thereby incorporated him and his Train only as so many more of his own Esquires Pages and other Retinue or Servants who made up the Parade upon these Ocsions The Earl of  Clarendon  certainly points at this malignant Stratagem where speaking of those dangerous Indiscretions which were the Harbingers of  Essex  's Ruin he mentions among them  His glorious feathertriumph when he caused    orangetawney Feathers in Despite of Sir  Walter Ralegh  to be worne in the  Tilt yard  even before her Majesty's own Face  But it must have been somewhat surprising to see them enter the Lists and orangetawney running against itself Yet the Earl's Success  which is also come to Light seems not to have been much regretted being so agreeable to the Merit of Usurpers insomuch that it proved  Ralegh  's Feather triumph in the Conclusion For though the Lord  Bacon  might have Reason not to mention the Earl's Name where he tells us a Gentleman who came to the Tilt all in Orangetawney and ran very ill came again the next Day all in green and ran worse yet another Author instead of this Gentleman names  Essex  and goes on as the Lord  Bacon  does with observing that  One of the Spectators hereupon asking Why this Tilter who seemed to be known in both Habits changed his Colours  another answered  Surely because it may be reported that there was one in green who ran worse than he in Orangecolour  Such like Disturbances and ill Blood as these Contests must have bred might well make the Queen weary of having  Essex  any longer about the Court and desirous of removing him to some Employment where he might more commendably exercise his martial Qualities A good Occasion offered itself in  Ireland  where  Tir Oen  's Rebellion had now overspread almost the whole Kingdom A Consultation was therefore held for sending over the fittest Person to suppress it The Lord  Mountjoy  was first proposed But  Essex  himself made Exceptions against his Want of Experience and Activity alledging  Ireland  required a Person of the first Rank who was an old General and considerable for Honour Interest and Estate to gain him Respect and Influence there by which  Camden  thinks he would have recommended himself and adds that when the Queen therefore resolved on  Essex  he slightly refused it advising her to some abler Person tho' continues that Historian he had an Objection ready against any Person she should have  have named Notwithstanding this Authority and that  Essex  's smooth tongued Adversaries were for lending Spurs to the Ambition that wanted a Bridle he seems to me by a Letter of his own genuine Stile in Prose and Verse to the Queen at his going over in the End of  March  to have looked upon the Government of that Kingdom as the most irksome Kind of Banishment and to have entered upon it with the utmost Aversion  To the Queen  'From a Mind delighting in Sorrow from Spirits wasted with Passion from a Heart torn in Pieces with Care Grief and Travel from a Man that hateth himself and all Things else that keep him alive what Service can your Majesty expect since any Service past deserves no more than Banishment and Proscription into the cursedst of all  slands It is your Rebels Pride and Succession must give me Leave to ransome myself out of this hateful Prison out of my loath'd Body which if it happen so your Majesty shall have no Cause to mislike the Fashion of my Death since the Course of my Life could never please you'  Happy he could finish forth his Fate  In some unhaunted Desart most obscure  From all Society from Love and Hate  Of worldly Folk then should he sleep secure  Then wake again and yield God ever Praise  Content with  Hips  and  Haws  and  Brambleberry  In Contemplation passing out his Days  And Change of holy Thoughts to make him merry  Who when he dies his Tomb may be a Bush  Where harmless  Robin  dwells with gentle  Thrush  Your Majesty's exiled Servant  ROBERT ESSEX  His Conduct in it was answerable to the Expectations of judicious Men and one of his own Servants who attended him thither says it was his blackest Employment that  Ireland  was ordained to be the Sepulchre of his Father and the Gulph of his own Fortunes  About four Months after  Essex  was thus disposed of there were great Apprehensions in  England  of an Invasion but from what Quarter is not well distinguished Soldiers were suddenly raised to guard the City and Queen's Person Chains were drawn across the Streets of  London  Watches set and Lights hung out at every Man's Door for above a Fortnight By Sea or Ships of the Royal Navy were fitted out with wonderful Speed under the Command of the Lord  Thomas Howard  as Admiral in the  Elizabeth Jonas  and Sir  Walter  Vice admiral in the  ArkRoyal  Whether occasioned by any Mistrust the  English  and  Spaniards  had of one another or a Policy held on both Sides to make Peace with Sword in Hand my Author does not resolve but is sure the Preparation on both Sides was very great as if one expected an Invasion from the other And yet it was generally conceived not to be intended by either but that our Fleet had only Relation to the Earl of  Essex  then in  Ireland  as if he had some desperate Design to try his Friends in  England  and to be revenged of those he thought his Enemies However it was the Care and Cost was not so great as necessary for it was known that the  Ade  antado  had drawn both his Ships and Galleys to the  Groyne  which was not usual but upon some Action intended for  England  or  Ireland  And seeing we were not to be surprised he diverted them afterwards to a different Use Another Benefit that arose to the Nation by putting it into this sudden Posture of Defence was the great Dexterity and Expedition wherewith it was taught to spring into Arms For the incredible Speed and Order of the Commanders in raising such a Land Army and fitting out such a Royal Navy was so admired both by  Spain France  and  Holland  that all Foreigners  confessed  Her Majesty's Deeds in War were not heretofore more dreadful to her Enemies than now only her Preparations for it  Insomuch that it is said an Envoy was sent by the Archduke from  Brussels  with Overtures of Peace tho' they did not then succeed Whether a designed Invasion from  Spain  was hereby blown over or her Majesty was better satisfied about the Earl of  Essex  we find not but she commanded her Fleet Home after it had been about a Month at Sea  Near a Month after this  Essex  returned privately out of  Ireland  with some of his choice Friends one whereof named Sir  Christopher St Lawrence  offered to murder the Lord  Gray  whom they met upon the Road and to dispatch Secretary  Cecyll  when they came to Court but  Essex  would not encourage so base an Act The Queen was now at  Nonsuch  hither  Essex  hastened to present himself on his Knees before her in her PrivyChamber early in the Morning and when her Majesty least dreamt of him says  Camden  who adds that she entertained him with some Marks of her Grace and Favour though not with that Freedom he used to find The Queen indeed ordered  Essex  to his Apartment and there to continue as  Camden  goes on for the Earl had not only disoblig'd her before but now given fresh Provocation by leaving  Ireland  without her Permission and for shuffling up a Truce there which might be broke at a Fortnight's Warning whereas he might have made an effectual Composition with the Rebels and was impower'd to give them a general Act of Indemnity The Excuses he offered before the Council were so unsatisfactory and his Behaviour so contemptuous that the Queen thought proper to commit him to Custody but appointed it to be in the Lord Keeper's House rather than a common  Prison chiefly to obstruct the Infusions of his pernicious Adherents to whom he was so infatuated that he could not relinquish them though one of the Objections which would be raised against him was by his own Hand presupposed to be the leaving of that Kingdom in such an unsettled Posture and returning into this with such a Pack of Swordsmen at his Heels  While  Essex  was thus in Restraint Commissioners were sent over to  Bulloigne  to negotiate the Peace with  Spain  This was in  May  And about the same Time we find Sir  Walter Ralegh  was also sent with the Lord  Cobham  upon an Embassy concerning the same into  Flanders  Their Business was kept very secret yet  Albert  Archduke of  Austria  and Governor of the  Netherlands  having charged the Queen of  England  it seems with relieving the  Hollanders  and being likely to take some Umbrage at so many Persons of considerable Rank going over Volunteers to Prince  Maurice  as the Lord of  Northumberland  Lord  Rutland  and others Secretary  Cecyll  wrote to the said Commissioners at  Bolloigne  that if the Archduke should object in the like Manner to  Cobham  and  Ralegh  they were to return Answer  That these had no Charge nor carried either Horse or Men except some half Dozen of their own Attendants and finding the Queen so resolved to have a Peace if good Conditions could be had they obtained leave with importunity to see that one Action then expected before they might despair of seeing any more of the like Kind in her Majesty's Time  Thus much of this Matter we have in a Letter of Secretary  Cecyll  's to those Commissioners In another written by Sir  Henry Neville  who was one of those Commissioners to Mr  Winwood  he mentions it as a Report that  Cobham  and  Ralegh  were  gone over upon Pretext to see the Camp and Siege of Fort  Isabella  near  Ostend  before which Prince  Maurice  lay but thinks they had some other End and that in  England  there was some Alarm taken at these Matters although he was not worthy to know it The said Sir  Henry  in another Letter to Mr  Winwood  says that the Journey of  Cobham  and  Ralegh  was not upon Curiosity only but that they carried some Message to Prince  Maurice  it seems which did no Harm and that he would reveal the Particulars when he was better informed of them These three Letters were written in  July  this Year and in the first of them we perceive  Ralegh  was returned into  England  by the fourteenth Day of the said Month  When he arrived at Court the Government of  Jersey  was it seems vacant by the Death of Sir  Anthony  Son of Sir  Amias Paulet  The Queen had many Addressors for this Preferment but she thought none so worthy of it as Sir  Walter Ralegh  About six Weeks after that is in the latter End of  August  his Patent was passed with Grant of the Manor or Lordship of  St Germain  in the said Island and all the Lands and Tenements therein There is a learned Inhabitant of this Island who in his curious and exact History of it giving us a Succession of the Governors says  Sir  Walter Ralegh  came in after the  Paulets  the Year only before his Royal Mistress Queen  Elizabeth  died and was attainted the first Year of King  James  so that we were soon bereaved of the Happiness we promised ourselves under so excellent a Person His bare Name in the List of our Governors does Honour to the Island  Yet as the same Author further observes out of the said Patent  When Sir  Walter Raleigh  himself had this Government given him by Queen  Elizabeth  she struck off  l  a Year from it which  she took into her own disposal and made that great Man so renowned for his eminent Services to her and to the whole Nation be contented with the Remainder  Essex  had now been called before the Council at the Lordkeeper's where for the Matters laid to his Charge he was suspended from some of his Offices But the Course of Penitence and Resignation which he held for a while gave great Hopes after he had obtain'd his Liberty that he would recover himself also at Court till his Creatures blew him up again with their poisonous Counsels and led him to expect not only a Restoration to Favour but with unreasonable Interest  insomuch that he neglected the Queen's Pardon because it came not accompanied with a new Grant of his Lease for the farming of sweet Wines  as a noble Author observes who adds  if ever that uncouth Speech fell from him of the Queen which is delivered to us by one who was then much conversant in the secrets of the Court that she was as crooked in her Disposition as in her Carcase all my Wonder at his Destruction is taken from me  After this Speech the Queen did as good as deny him the Wine Licenses aforesaid as  Camden  relates Then  Essex  threw himself open to all ill Impressions renewing the Project he had begun in  Ireland  of removing by Force his Enemies at Court He curried Favour with King  James  in  Scotland  by several respectful Letters wherein he laboured to prejudice the King against those who had any Influence in the  English  Court and was very particular in acquainting him with the Interest of his Adversaries as one of whom he failed not to set forth Sir  Walter Ralegh  with the formidable Power he had in the West of  England  and now again in the Isle of  Jersey  that  Cobham  was Warden of the  Cinque Ports  Lord  Burghley  President of the  North  and Sir  George Carew  President of  Munster  in the South of  Ireland  That those were Places commodious for the  Spaniards  to land and these Persons well affected to the King of  Spain  and altogether with the Lord Treasurer Admiral and Secretary steer'd the Helm of Government Then he practised with the said King to send Ambassadors into  England  to press a publick Declaration of his Title to the Succession prepares Instructions for that Purpose still instancing the exorbitant Power of his Enemies their Disaffection to the King of  Scots  and great Veneration for the Infanta These Proceedings were outwardly varnish'd over all this while with the gloss of Conscience and Religion he won over the Puritans and their Preachers to his Party commiserated the afflicted Condition of the Papists retained a Crew of  Desperado  's to guard his House and left none uncountenanc'd who had nothing to hope for but Changes and Revolutions  Thus these ill Humours kept gathering till  Sunday  the th of  February  following and then broke out as may be seen at large in our Histories of these Times At Court the Guard was doubled being appris'd of this Eruption and the Morning it happened Sir  Walter Ralegh  sent out of particular Kindness to Sir  Ferdinando Gorges  one of  Essex  's Adherents and Governor of  Plymouth  Fort to come in all Haste to him at  Durhamhouse  to speak with him and as the more private Way that he would come by Water  Gorges  in the  Manuscript  he writ to vindicate himself from the Imputation of betraying  Essex  by this Meeting avers that he advertis'd his Lordship of this Message and that upon Council the Earl was willing he should go but directing him to appoint  his Meeting with  Ralegh  upon the  Thames  and not to land at  Durham House  also to take with him a Guard for securing his Return The Conference that passed between them as  Gorges  relates it was only this  When Sir  Walter Ralegh's  Boat came to me he being all alone and I having two Gentlemen he told me that he had sent for me to admonish me to make all Haste out of the Town down to my Charge there being a Warrant out for the sending me to the Fleet For his kind Advertisement I gave him Thanks but told him withal because I knew the present Occasion would soon discover itself that it came too late for I had engaged myself in another Matter He further inquiring of me what it was I told him there were    Gentlemen who had resolved that Day to live or die Free Men He protested unto me he heard not of it until that Morning but did not see what they were able to do against the Queen's Authority My Answer was it was the Abuse of that by him and others which made so many honest Men resolve to seek a Reformation thereof His Reply was that no Man is without a Colour for his Intent and advised me to look to myself and to remember my Duty and Allegiance I answer'd that I knew not any Man who did not more respect his Allegiance than his Life as the End would make apparent and thus we parted he to the Court and I to Essex house  In the Confession made by this  Gorges  eight Days after that of their Insurrection abovenamed before some of the Privy Council it appears Sir  Christopher Blount  had persuaded him to murder or seize Sir  Walter Ralegh  at this Meeting upon the Water For not doing either  Gorges  apologizes in the Manuscript aforesaid after this Manner  If it be demanded of me why I did not then take Sir  Walter Ralegh  First It was not a Matter I ever proposed though many persuaded  me so to do Secondly I never held it an Act fitting among Men to betray any that repose Trust in us and he putting himself into my Hands with what Honesty could I have avowed so barbarous a Deed unless he had given me the first Occasion by violent Deeds or unkind Words for either of which I was both resolved and prepared And at my Return I deliver'd unto my Lord what had passed between Sir  Walter Ralegh  and my self which he received with Applause as may be testified by those who were present and yet alive  Lastly in another Part of the said Manuscript  Gorges  says  The Reason why I acknowledge I had Means to have taken or killed Sir  Walter Ralegh  was the better to make it appear that there was neither malicious or butcherous Course intended to him or any and also to give him Cause to acknowledge himself in that Respect beholden unto me whereby to take from him Occasion to exercise his Power which I knew to be great at that Juncture to my Ruin For I did believe he could not in Reason be so void of human Respect as not to requite one Courtesy with another and also it was no Matter of Treason against her Majesty but rather a Manifestation of the contrary approving this Intent to be particular against Sir  Walter Ralegh  and others  This is the Conference which passed between them a few Hours before the Insurrection as  Gorges  has represented it  After  Essex  with his Party had made several Excursions and some Persons had been slain both on his Side and the Queen's After he had been proclaimed a Traitor by the King of Arms in several Parts of the City and was driven by Water to seek Garrison in his own House we find  Ralegh  mentioned among the several Nobles and Knights who invested it tho' he appears in no particular Action against the said Earl or his Company  But when the Earl soon after surrender'd himself and was brought to Examination he profess'd that he was to have been assaulted or assassinated by his private Enemies of this we have the following Account publish'd by Authority  As in all former Discontentments he had gone the beaten Path of Traitors turning their Imputation upon Counsellors and Persons of Credit with their Sovereign so now he was forced to descend to the Pretext of a private Quarrel giving out how that Evening when he should have been called before the Lords of the Council there was an Ambuscade of Musketeers placed upon the Water by the Device of my Lord  Cobham  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  to have murdered him in the Way as he pass'd A Matter of no Probability continues my Author those Persons having no such desperate Estates or Minds as to ruin themselves and their Posterity by committing so odious a Crime On the contrary it was certain Sir  Ferdinando Gorges  accused  Blount  persuading him to kill or at least apprehend Sir  Walter Ralegh  and that  Gorges  rejecting this Advice  Blount  sent four Shot after him in a Boat which  Blount  denied not and asked  Ralegh  Forgiveness for it at the Time of his Death  But there were other Improbabilities to discredit this Slander as we may safely call it since the State call'd it by a grosser Name besides that the Persons so accused had Reputations and Estates better establish'd than to overthrow them by such a detestable Deed  as  Essex  's declining to produce or name any Author of such an Information besides his varying from himself like the Judges in the Story of  Susannah  from one another in the Place as one while he was to have been murdered in his Bed and another on the Water also in the Time and Persons as that it was to have been done by Jesuits and some Days before so that in the End this Accusation  by  Essex  was resembled to the Action of  Pisistratus  who proceeded so far in this Kind of Fiction and Dissimulation that he lanced his own Body and came wounded before the People as though he had been assaulted by his private Enemies thus obtained a Guard about his Person whereby he afterwards usurped upon the State  Further what may perfectly clear up the Innocence of  Cobham  and  Ralegh  from this unworthy Calumny is the Acknowledgment which  Blount  made at his own Trial when being asked by Secretary  Cecyll Whether he thought my Lord  Cobham  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  intended any such Assassination of the Earl he answered that he did not believe they ever meant any such Thing nor that the Earl himself feared it only it was a Word cast out to colour other Matters  And lastly what may tend to prove that  Ralegh  did rather compassionate and incline to befriend the Earl than harbour any Enmity that was implacable against him is that one of the Earl's own Faction Capt  Thomas Lee  should have such Hopes that  Ralegh  might be persuaded into the Danger of disobliging the Queen by Importunity or other violent Means for retrieving both  Essex  and  Southampton  from the Jaws of Death as by Way of Proposition to tell Sir  Robert Cross  who had been an old Officer under  Ralegh  in several Engagements at Sea  That Sir  Walter Ralegh  might get himself eternal Honour and Love more than ever he can otherwise if he would procure her Majesty's Warrant to free the Lords which he might compass by undertaking her Person  for this does not only shew the Opinion that was held of  Ralegh  's Power with the Queen but the Probability that he might be induced to exert it for the Rescue of those Noblemen We find he did use his Interest for some who were drawn in unawares and got a Pardon for Sir  Edmund Bainham  also for  John Littleton  and  Orell  a brave old Soldier the two former were Men of Fortune and their Purses might bleed or be threatened upon this Occasion But as  Camden  observes few paid the Fines laid on them  On the th of  February Essex  was arraigned at  Westminster  and we find in his Trial that Sir  Walter Ralegh  with of the Queen's Guard was as Captain thereof there present upon Duty  Ralegh  was here examined about the Conference beforementioned and all he said was  That  Gorges  told him on the Water  Essex  had put himself into a strong Guard at his House and this would be the bloodiest Day's Work that ever was wishing he would speed to Court for the Prevention of it and that he himself wished  Gorges  to refuse their Company else he would be undone  This is all  Ralegh  said of that Conference which  Gorges  here also in Court confirmed But  Essex  seems to charge  Gorges  with Prevarication where he replies  Whatsoever Sir  Walter Ralegh  hath said differeth altogether from that which Sir  Ferdinando  told us at  Essexhouse  upon his Return from the Water  And indeed it is not likely he should tell  Essex  he advised  Ralegh  to go to Court and prevent the Insurrection Six Days after  Essex  was beheaded in the  Court yard  of  LondonTower  Among the many Persons of Distinction there present was Sir  Walter Ralegh  probably in his Charge again as Captain of the Guard He stood near the Scaffold according to his own Assertion that he might better answer if  Essex  should be desirous of speaking to him But his Enemies expounded his Presence there in such a barbarous Sense says  Camden  as if he had pressed near the Place of Execution ouly to feast his Eyes with the Tragedy of the Earl's Sufferings and the greatest or most notorious of  Ralegh  's Enemies  who is known to us he who betrayed him to his untimely End as will be observ'd did after  Ralegh  's Death when he could not answer for himself insinuate that he not only insulted upon  Essex  being dead but even plotted his Downfal as that  he had called the Earl's Saintship in Question  had writ in some Letters  that the great Boy died like a Calf and like a Craven  and that soon after the Execution a Gentleman returning from  Spain  touched at  Sherborne  who being asked by  Ralegh what they said in  Spain  of  Essex  's Death  answered  They had not heard of it but he was sorry to bear that in the Island Voyage the Earl had brought him to his Mercy  to which that  Ralegh  answer'd  but I trust I am now quit with him  and as a more evident Demonstration says that the Night before the Earl's Suffering  Ralegh gave Instructions to the Lieutenant of the Tower for the Execution of the Warrant  Which surely he did not do without Authority But these Particulars it must be observed come from the Person stigmatiz'd with having ensnared  Ralegh  to his Destruction and to the Person who destroy'd him with Endeavour to Palliate the Conduct of both to the World And as we find those Obloquies gave not Satisfaction to their Author's Cotemporaries So we have produced them that they may not escape the Reception they deserve of Posterity As for  Ralegh  's Comportment to  Essex  we may guess what it was while the Earl was alive since he made no Exceptions to it at his Death when he had free Liberty of Speech and when  Ralegh  came to the same End it appears by his last▪ Words that he had relented more at the Earl's Fate than any Thing were hear of in his pretended Friends and that he retir'd from the Sight of the Earl at the Time of his Death in Compliance with the Misconstruction  of the Populace though he afterwards repented it since the Earl had a Desire to see and speak with him before he took his Farewel of the World  This Desire was in all Probability to ask  Ralegh  Forgiveness for having so dishonourably treated and traduced him to countenance his own rash Purposes For just such a Desire had Sir  Christopher Blount  when his own Execution approached on the th of  March  following at  TowerHill  where understanding that  Ralegh  as Captain of the Guard was near the Scaffold he said  Sir  Walter Ralegh  I thank God that you are present I had an infinite Desire to speak with you to ask you Forgiveness e'er I died both for the Wrong done you and for my particular ill Intent towards you I beseech you forgive me  Ralegh answered  that he most willingly forgave him and besought God to forgive him and to give him his divine Comfort protesting before the Lord that whatever Sir  Christopher Blount  meant towards him for his Part he never bore him any ill Intent  And further said to him  I pray you without Offence let me put you in Mind that you have been esteemed not only a principal Provoker and Persuader of the Earl of  Essex  in all his undutiful Courses but especially an Adviser in that which has been confess'd of his Purpose to transport a great Part of her Majesty's Army out of  Ireland  into  England  to land at  Milford  and thence to turn it against her sacred Person You will do well to tell the Truth herein and to satisfy the World  Blount reply'd  When I was brought from  Reban  to  Dublin  and lodg'd in the Castle his Lordship and the Earl of  Southampton  came to visit me and he began thus plainly with me That he intended to transport a choice Part of the Army of  Ireland  into  England  and land them in  Wales  at  Milford  or  thereabouts And so securing his Descent would gather such other Forces as would enable him to march to  London I answer'd  I would that Night consider of it  Next Day the Earls came again I told them  Such an Enterprize as it was most dangerous would cost much Blood so as I could not like it But I rather advised him to go over himself with a good Train and make sure of the Court than make his own Conditions and tho' we never resolved to hurt her Majesty's Person yet I know and must confess if we had failed of our Ends we should rather than have been disappointed even have drawn Blood from herself  Then giving a few farther Hints of their Progress in general he leaves the rest to his Confessions made before the PrivyCounsellors whom he names and to whom he beseeches Sir  Walter Ralegh  to commend him for their favourable and charitable Dealing Lastly having also declared he died in the Catholick Faith and bid farewel to the Lords  Gray Compton  and the rest he made a decent End Thus have we connected all the Passages of  Essex  's Insurrection wherein we have found  Ralegh  any ways mention'd or concern'd which with several other remarkable Parts of his Story those Authors who had read many of the Tracts Letters Records and other Manuscripts whence it is here drawn out have visibly curtail'd and suppress'd in their Annals and Chronicles of this Reign which were publish'd in the next  The following Summer in the Year it appears that  Ralegh  attended upon the Queen in her Progress and when the King of  France  came to  Calais  on the Alarm of the ArchDuke's besieging of  Ostend  her Majesty was at  Dover  Ambassadors were sent over to each other on this Occasion and in that private Dispatch of the Marquis of  Rosney  afterwards Duke of  Sully  related only by  himself we find that upon his landing at  Dover  he was received by  Ralegh  in Company with the Lords  Cobham Sidney  and others The Interview then expected between these two Princes was not brought to pass nor seem the Proposals made to her Majesty about the War with  Spain  to have had the full Effect that was hoped for because not long after on the th of  September  there arrived at  London  another Ambassador from  France  named the Duke of  Biron  with a very noble numerous and stately Equipage to the Number of or Persons The Queen was then in  Hantshire  and during the Days she was entertained at  Bosing  the Marquis or  Winchester  's Seat the Duke of  Biron  with his Retinue was brought to the  Vine  a fair House in the said County of the Lord  Sandys  which was furnish'd with B  ds by the neighbouring Gentry and with all other Accommodations from the Queen's Palaces for the Reception of the said Ambassador I leave this Entertainment to the Description of the  French  and  English  Historians who observe it as one discontinued Festival and that the lik  was never made by any of our Princes in a Progress 'Tis more particularly to be expected that  Ralegh  did here attend upon the Court because he was commonly appointed to entertain the foreign Ministers especially of  France  or the  States  being so well acquainted with those People and their Policies And when the Queen left the Country we find among the ten Persons she there knighted a greater Number than ever she had conferr'd that Honour upon at one Time that one of them was  Carew  John Stow'  Annals  Edit Fol  This is that Sir  Carew Ralegh▪  who appears in the CourtRolls of  Gillingham  in  to have been one of the Stewards his Brother Sir  Walter Ralegh  being the other of that Manor in these Times belonging the Crown as I have it from a Letter of some obliging Remarks upon the Family of the  Raleghs  written by  William Nicholas  Esq of  Westhorsely  in  Sussex  This must be also the same Sir  Carew Ralegh  who had in for what Consideration is not mention'd  l  paid him from the Government as I find in an  Abstract of the State of his Majesty's Revenue  reprinted vo p Likewise the same who sold  Widdycombe Ralegh  to one of the  Martyns  as is before observed and the antient Patrimony of  Fardel  to  Walter Heale  Esq of  Brixton  as  John Prince  informs us in the  Worthies of Devon  Fol Lastly the same Sir  Carew Ralegh  who married  Dorothy  Daughter of Sir  William Wroughton  and Relict of Sir  John Thynne  by whom he had  Gilbert  Hier of  Downton  and he by  Lucy  Daughter of Sir  Gilly Wroughton  of  Broadbinton  in  Wilts▪  had several Children as  Gilbert George Walter Katharine Anne  c This I gather from a Pedigree of the  Raleghs  in the Possession of  Brown Willis  Esq mention'd at the Beginning of this Work wherein it farther appears the said Sir  Carew  his Son and GrandChildren were all alive in And hence the  Wiltshire Raleghs  have flourish'd to these latter Times  the Brother of Sir  Walter Ralegh  But as for that Passage in a  French  Historian lately quoted between the Queen and the Ambassador when they were in  London  of her shewing him among the Heads of those Rebels which were stuck upon the  Tower  that of the Earl of  Essex  it has been proved fabulous by  Camden  'Whereas certain  French  Writers have mention'd says  Camden  that the Queen shewed to  Biron  the Earl of  Essex  's Skull in her Closet or according to others sixer upon a Pole it must needs be a Story as ridiculous as false since that was interr'd with his Body'  Annal Eliz    who would doubtless have detected other such Falsities in the said  French  Author relating to our  English  History and in particular to Sir  Walter Ralegh  had his  Annals  extended to the Year in which we shall be obliged to take Notice thereof  Soon after the Queen's Return from this Progress her last Parliament met at  Westminster  and that was on the th Day of  October  This was a Session  full of important Business and  Ralegh  appears frequently engaged in it The first or most antient List of the Members of the House of Commons at least extant is as I have been told by an eminent Antiquary that which we have of this Parliament and herein it appears that Sir  Walter Ralegh  was one of the Knights of the Shire for the County of  Cornwall John Arundell  Esq being the other and that Sir  Carew Ralegh  was one of the Burgesses for  Foway  in the same County The first Speech we have of Sir  Walter  's upon Record in this Parliament was on  November  the th and in Opposition to the Act for sowing of Hemp  For my Part said he I do not like this constraining of Men to manure or use their Ground at our Wills but rather let every Man use his Ground to that which it is most fit for and therein use his own Discretion For Halsiers Cables Cordage and the like we have plentifully enough from foreign Nations and we have Countries here in  England  that make use thereof in Abundance And the Bill of Tillage may be a sufficient Motive to us in this Case not to take the Course that this Bill intends For where the Law provides that every Man must plough the third Part of his Land I know divers poor People have done so to avoid the Penalty of the Statute when their Abilities have been so poor that they have not been able to buy Séedcorn to sow it withal nay they have been fain to hire others to plough it which if it had been unploughed would have been good Pasture for Beasts or might have been converted to other good Uses  Upon this Motion all the House bid away with the Bill But it was put to the Question whether it should be committed or no Some Doubt arising the House was divided and the  Yea's  were the  Noes  so the Bill was not committed It was afterwards put to the Question for ingrossing  and notwithstanding Mr  Comptroller  's Speech for the Weight of it which is not preserved it was denied and so absolutely rejected Three Days after Sir  Walter Ralegh  was at the Committee in the House touching the Subsidy Here he moved them to consider for what Intent they came thither and now in their coming what was to be considered  For the Subsidy  said he  the Manner and Quality thereof I will now only intimate thus much to you that the last Parliament only three Subsidies were granted upon fear that the  Spaniards  were coming but now we see they are come and have set Foot even in the Queen's Territories already therefore are the more of us to be respected and regarded And seeing the Sale of her Majesty's own Jewels the great Loans her Subjects have lent her yet unpaid the continual selling of her Lands and decaying of her Revenues the sparing even out of her own Purse and Apparel for our own Sakes will not serve but she must yet be fain to call her Court of Parliament for our Advice and Aid in this Case I wish for my part as a particular Member of the Commonwealth that we may not do less than we did before and that we may also bountifully according to our Estates contribute to her Majesty's Necessities as they now stand  This Speech was confirmed by many other Members and met with no Opposition that we read of But the manner of raising this Subsidy created some short Debate in which Sir  Francis Hastings  moved that the  Three Pound  Men might be exempted and all others above that Rate to pay according to the  Rate  to make up a full Subsidy To this Sir  Walter Ralegh  answered  If all pay none will be aggrieved if any be exempted doubtless it will breed much Grief the feeling will be great to those  Three Pound  Men that will feel any Thing but it will be nothing to them that know  any Thing  Sir  Edward Hobby  who it seems sat near the Door not hearing well this Speech said  You should speak standing that the House might hear you Ralegh  answered  That being in a Committee he might speak sitting or standing  so without rising repeated his former Words In the End this Proposal was agreed to and Secretary  Cecyll  reported to the whole House  That most Voices concluded there should be no Exception of the  Three Pound  Men because according to their Rate some were assessed under Value besides Separation might breed Emulation Suspicion of Partiality and Confusion  Yet when  Cecyll  among those who launched out  Of whom none more remarkable than Serjeant  Heale▪  who marvelled much the House should demur upon granting this Subsidy or in the Time of Payment  'When all we have said he is her Majesty's and she may lawfully at Pleasure take it from us Yea she has as much Right to all our Lands an Goods as to any Revenue of her Crown'  At which the House hummed and laughed  'Well all your  Humming  said the Serjeant shan't put me out of Countenance'  So to mend the Matter he told them  'he could prove his former Position in the Time of King  Henry  III King  John  King  Stephen  c'  At this the House was lou  er than before 'till they hummed the Serjeant into his Seat but he was afterwards more particularly exposed for these slavish Principles    carried the Matter so high as to say  That neither Pots or Pans nor Dish nor Spoon should be spared when Danger is at our Elbows nor would by any Means have the  Three Pound  Men excluded because he'd have the King of  Spain  know how willing we are to sell all in Defence of God's Religion our Prince and our Country  and when Mr  Francis Bacon  in his Speech concluded it was  Dulcis tractus pari jugo therefore the Poor as well as the Rich not to be exempted Ralegh  did answer  I like it not that the  Spaniards  our Enemies should know of our selling our Pots and Pans to pay Subsidies well may you call it Policy as an honourable  Person alledged but I am sure it argues Poverty in the State And for the Motion that was last made  Dulcis tractus pari  jugo  Call you this  par jugum  when a poor Man pays as much as a rich and peradventure his Estate is no better than it is set at or but little better while our Estates are three or four Pounds in the Queen's Books and it is not the hundredth Part of our Wealth therefore it is neither  dulcis  nor  par This might flow as well from the natural Source of his own Benignity as from any Compliance with the Queen's Inclination to favour the poorer Sort for whom  Ralegh  seems by her Command to have before indeed been a chosen Advocate  Sir  Walter  speaking of a Parliament in the Reign of King  Richard  II wherein a Subsidy was given only by the better Sort and the Commons spared says in the Person of a Justice of Peace  'I myself once moved it in Parliament in the Time of Queen  Elizabeth  who desired much to spare the common People and I did it by her Commandment but when we cast up the Subsidybooks we found the Sum but small wheu the Pound Men perhaps the Cypher is added by Mistake were left out'  See  Ralegh  's  Prerogative  of  Parliaments    but he knowing as well as the Rest of the Members by former Experience▪ that such a Supply as her Majesty now wanted▪ being no less than Pounds according to  Cecyll  's Representation could not be raised▪ if such an Exemption were admitted of the former Proposition prevailed and the three pound Men were necessarily included  When the Complaint against Monopolies was made on the th of  November  and Dr  Bennet  mentioned that of Cards I cannot perceive how it could be justly observed in the Journals to make any Change in the Countenance of Sir  Walter Ralegh  since in the same Journals it is also observed that the Patent for Cards was now granted to  Edward Darcy  But when Mr  Martin  spoke of a  Country that groaned nnder the Burthen of monstrous and unconscionable Substitutes to Monopolitans of Starch Tin Fish Cloth Oil Vinegar Salt and what not  Sir  Walter Ralegh  replied  I am urged to speak in two Respects the one because I find myself touched upon in particular the other in that I take some Imputation and Slander to be offered unto her Majesty I mean by the Gentleman who first mentioned Tin For that being one of the principal Commodities of this Kingdom and being in  Cornwall  it has ever so long as there were any belonged to the Dukes of  Cornwall  and they had special Patents of Privilege It has pleased her Majesty freely to bestow on me that Privilege and that Patent being Word for Word the very same the Duke's is And because by Reason of my Office of Lordwarden of the  Stannaries  I can sufficiently inform this House of the State thereof I will make bold to deliver it unto you When the Tin is taken out of the Mine and molten and refined then is every Piece containing    Weight sealed with the Duke's Seal And by Reason of this Privilege which I now have he ever had the Refusal in buying thereof for the Words of the Patent are  Nisi nos emere voluimus  Now I will tell you that before the granting of my Patent whether Tin were but at    Shillings and so upward to    Shillings a Hundred yet the poor Workman never had but two Shillings a Week finding himself But since my Patent whosoever will work be Tin at what Price soever they have four Shillings a Week truly paid there is no Poor that will work there but may and have that Wages  But notwithstanding his Merit as well as Right  Ralegh  concluded saying  Yet if all others may be repealed I will give my Consent as freely to the cancelling of this as any Member of this House  It is noted that a great and uncommon Silence followed this Speech At  last Sir  Francis Hastings  said in Respect thereto  I joy to see so great a Reformation that we may speak quietly and be heard peaceably every Man has not alike Sense or Judgment neither is every Man's Memory alike I wish that if any Gentleman who speaks of this or any other Subject as curious shall let fall any Word amiss or unpleasing that it may be attributed rather to Earnestness than Want of Duty  Throughout the further Proceedings against the numerous Monopolies now in Force we find not any Mention made of his Patent aforesaid among those which were particularly promis'd to be revoked or abolished as Grievances to the State On the th of  November  Sir  Edmund Morgan  and Mr  Pemberton  both Members of the House being served with  Subpoenas  to appear in the Court of  Chancery  the same Day at the Suit of Sir  Walter  and Sir  Carew Ralegh  they had the Privilege granted them The Officers who served those  Subpoenas  were taken into the Custody of the Serjeant but soon released upon pleading they knew not those Gentlemen to be Members of Parliament This is all I find of that Suit concerning Sir  Walter Ralegh  On the d of  December  he spoke against the Defects and Hardships in a Bill that was read  for Reformation of Abuses in Inns  as that  it would deprive those who by their Lordships or Manors had Right to enquire into the Default of selling Liquors by full Measure of their Privilege that by disabling a Man for ever after of being an Innkeeper how detrimental it might be to the Inheritance of those who had Inns some at    Pounds  per Annum  and how dangerous to Innkeepers who might by the Negligence of a Servant suffer All which he left to the Discretion of the House  After other like Objections by another Member or two we hear no more of it Soon after the  Means of suppressing the Pirates of  Dunkirk  now grown strong both in Arms and Shipping came under the Consideration of this House As one Remedy against them it was proposed to restrain the Transportation of Ordnance and a Bill to prohibit the same was read a second Time on the th of  December  but before it was committed there passed many Speeches upon this important Argument It seems a Patent for transporting them had been granted to Sir  Henry Nevill  and the Queen's Duty thereby rose to  l  a Year yet this Profit no Ways ballanced the Inconveniences For being carried into all Countries that were Friends with  Dunkirk  and Confederates with  Spain  the  Spaniards  had such Plenty that they now usually sold Weight of Iron Ordnance for seven Ducats and a half The Laws were moreover urged in of  Henry  VIII and of  Edward  VI which prohibited the Transporting of Gun Metal and tho' Guns were not then made of Iron they now were therefore it was within the Power of those Laws Sir  Walter Ralegh  in Approbation of this Motion said  I  Sir  Walter Ralegh  has also written upon this Subject in two or three Places In his  Discourse touching a War with  Spain  and the protecting of the  Netherlands written not long after he made the afore  aid Speech having told King  James  how he remembered that within these Years two of her Majesty's Ships would have commanded Sail of theirs and that when he w s a Captain in  Ireland  Foot and Horse would have beaten all the Force of the strongest Provinces He adds  'but of late I have known an  Easterling  fight Hand to H nd with one of her Majesty's Ships and  have in this last War overthrown with even or far less Number The  Netherlands  continues he in those Days had wooden Guns and the  Irish  had Dar  but the one is now furnished with as great a Number of  English  Ordnance as ourselves and the other with as good pikes and Muskets as  England  hath'  See  Ralegh  's  three Discourses  vo p In another  Discourse  he afterwards writ  touching a Marriage between Prince  Henry  of  England  and a Daughter of  Savoy speaking of the  Netherlands  he has these Words  'Whereas in my Time I have known one of her Majesty's Ships command of theirs to strike Sail they will now undertake us one to one and not give us a good Morrow They master us both in their Number and in their Mariners and they have our own Ordnance to break our own Bones withal We had Reason to help them but not to help them up to that Height as to make them able to tread upon our own Heads'  Thus in the old MS of that Discourse communicated by the noble Earl of  Oxford  Lastly in another  Discourse  Sir  Walter Ralegh  wrote after this I mean that  on the Invention of Shipping  he has more copiously argued upon this Head These Arguments I shall here also annex both as what will exemplify the Constancy of his Judgment and prove the Genuiness of these Discourses though two of them are posthumous Publications and the other was never published "There is no State says he grown in Haste but that of the  United Provinces  especially in their SeaForces and by a contrary Way to that of  France  or  Spain  the latter by Invasion the former by Oppression For I myself may remember when one Ship of her Majesty's would have made  Hollanders  strike Sail and to come to Anchor they did not then dispuce  de▪ mari  be  o  but readily acknowledged the  English  to be  Domini Maris Britannici"  And a little further "But whence comes this Dispute Not from the Encrease of Numbers not because our Neighbours breed more Mariners than we do nor from the Greatness of their Trade in all Parts of the World for the  French  creep into all Corners of  America  as they do and the  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  employ more Ships by many fishing Trades excepted than the  Netherlands  But it comes from the detestable Covetousness of such particular Persons as have gotten Licences and given Way to the transporting of  English  Ordnance  Fuit haec sapientia quondam publica privatis secernere sacra profanis  and that in so great Abundance that not only our good Friends the  Hollanders  and  Zealanders  have furnished themselves and have them lying on their Wharfs to sell to others but all other Nations have had from us not only to furnish their Fleets but to garnish all their Forts and other Places fertifying their Coasts without which the  Spanish  King durst not have dismounted so many Pieces of Brass in  Naples  and elsewhere to arm his great Fleet in But it was directly proved in the Lowerhouse of Parliament  Anno  of Queen  Elizabeth  that there were landed in  Naples  above  Culverins English  since which Time and not long since it is lamentable that so many have been transported into  Spain  But those belike who then determin'd it and the Transporters have now forsaken the Country and tho' the Procurers remain I am resolved they also have forsaken the Care of his Majesty's Estate and the Honour of this Nation I urge not this Point as thinking it unfit to furnish his Majesty's good Friends and Allies who have had with us one common Enemy for many Years But all politick States have well observed this Precept  Ut  ic tractarent amicum tanqnam inimicum futurum  for what are all the Ships in the World to be valued at other than a Company of  floating Tubs  were they not furnish'd with Ordnance either to offend others or defend themselves If a Ship of Tons had in her Musketeers and never a great Gun with one  Crumster  carrying or  Culverins  she may be beaten to Pieces and her Men slaughtered Certainly the Advantage which the  English  had by their Bows and Arrows in former Times was never so great as we might now have had by our Iron Ordnance if we had either kept it within the Land kept it from our Enemies or imparted it to our Friends moderately For as by the former we obtained many notable Victories and made ourselves Masters of many Parts of  France  so by the latter we might have commanded the Seas and thereby the Trade of the World itself But we have now to our future Prejudice and how far to our Prejudice I know not forged Hammers and delivered them out of our Hands to break our own Bones withal" See  judicious and select  Essays  by Sir  Walter Ralegh vo p c  am sure heretofore one Ship  of her Majesty's was able to beat ten  Spaniards  ut now by Reason of our own Ordnance we are hardly matched one to one And if the  LowCountries  should either be subdued by the  Spaniard  or yield unto him upon a conditional Peace or shall join in Amity with the  French  as we see them daily inclining I say there is nothing does so much threaten the Conquest of this Kingdom as the Transportation of Ordnance and therefore I think it a good and speedy Course to proceed by Way of Petition lest we be cut off from our Desires either by the Upper House or before by the Shortness and sudden Ending of the Parliament  The Generality agreed with him in the Needfulness  of restraining this Privilege however they proceeded by Way of Bill which passed the Commons but not the Lords for other Business interfering it fell asleep 'till the End of the Session and then the Speaker  Crook  who was to represent it to her Majesty forgetting his Promise it came to nothing  On the th of  December  the Dispute was renew'd whether the Statute of Tillage should be continu'd This Statute was made in the Time of Dearth and Sir  Walter Ralegh  agreed with those who were for having it now repeal'd His Reason for it was because  many poor Men are not able to find Seed to sow so much Ground as they are bound to plough which they must do or incur the Penalty of the Law Besides all Nations abound with Corn  France  offer'd the Queen to serve  Ireland  with Corn for sixteen Shillings a Quarter which is but two Shillings the Bushel if we should sell it so here the Ploughman would be beggar'd The  LowCountryman  and the  Hollander  who never sow Corn have by their Industry such Plenty that they will serve other Nations The  Spaniard  who often wants Corn had we never so much Plenty would never be beholden to the  Englishman  for it neither to the  LowCountryman  nor to  France  but will fetch it even of the very  Barbarian  and that which the  Barbarian  has been suing for these    Years I mean for Traffick of Corn into  Spain  the King in Policy has set at Liberty of himself because he will not be beholden to other Nations And therefore I think the best Course is to set it at Liberty and leave every Man free which is the Desire of a true  Englishman After other Speeches it was put to the Question whether the Bill of Tillage should be committed and it pass'd in the affirmative But it having pleas'd her Majesty to license Mr  Dormer  under  her Letters patent with a  Nonobstante  this Statute to enclose Acres of Ground he prayed the House to admit of this Proviso therefore it was put to the Question and carried The  Noes  demanded a Division of the House Whereupon Mr  Richard Martyn  observ'd the  Noes  had always carried it in this Parliament when they came to a Division many staying with the  Yeas  because they would not lose their Places Sir  Walter Ralegh  rose to answer him but many hurrying out to the Division he and  Cecyll  it seems took some Displeasure for after the Division when Mr  Dormer  's Proviso carried it again by a Majority whereby the House was set quiet Sir  Walter Ralegh  said  I thought I had deserved of the House to have been heard to speak as well as he that spake before the Division and in that I offer'd to speak and was not heard I had Wrong For him that last spake it was out of Humour and not out of Judgment Notwithstanding I think it a Monopoly and the Speech to be both Persuasion and to lay a great Imputation upon the House And this is all I would have said before  Next Day came on the Question whether the Tax for  DoverHaven  should be continued by Force of the Statute which was Three Pence a Ton for the Burthen of every Ship One Member Mr  Swale  objected that the Charge amounted to at least a Thousand Marks a Year yet the Haven was never the better and that it was grown a proverbial Wish of any Tax that it would not continue like that of  DoverHaven  But Mr  John Boys  shewed the Conveniency of this Haven and how many hundred Pounds worth of Stones were ready to repair it Sir  John Fortescue  also observ'd what large Ships of Burthen it would receive how necessary it is for the Passage of all Merchants  As also that the Tax was small and the Time might be when it would need a great Tax at one Time Lastly Mr Comptroller having likewise express'd how imprudent it was to take away this Tax now they were debating how to defend themselves from the  Dunkirkers  which would weaken the most necessary Haven of  England  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was more particular in these Words  There are divers Havens which have been famous and now are grown to decay as  Tinmouth Seaton  and  Winchelsey Rye  is of little Receipt  Sandwich  as a Burgess of that Town Mr  Peak  said this Parliament is even a going The Tax being employ'd as it should be I hold it both good and necessary and there is no Trade of Fishermen to  Newfoundland  but by this Haven of  Dover  which if the Tax be taken away and that go to Decay her Majesty shall lose one of the best and most necessary Havens of  England  which hath all the Commodities that Mr Comptroller shewed and lies opposite to all our Enemies Countries who may soon be with us and we not able to resist them or help ourselves should we want this Haven I think it therefore fit this Matter should be consider'd of and committed  And so it was  The th of  December  was read the third Time a Bill for the more diligent Resort to Church on  Sundays  which produced several Speeches in the House The Recusants were very numerous at this Time no less than in  Yorkshire  as Dr  Bennet  affirm'd which might be one Reason for now urging this Bill but those who were no ways popishly inclin'd perceived several insufferable Defects in it as Mr  John Bond  who among other Arguments was not for exposing the Ecclesiastical Authority among their Enemies as more impotent than a Twelvepenny Fine At last there was a Proviso added to it  That if any Man came eight  Times a Year to Church and said the usual Divine Service twice every  Sunday  and HolyDay in his House with his whole Family that should be a sufficent Dispensation  But the Bill weak enough of itself was overthrown by this Conjunction after Sir  Walter Ralegh  had shewed  That all the ChurchWardens of every Shire must come to the Assizes to give information to the Grand Jury Say then there be    Parishes in a Shire there must now come extraordinarily    ChurchWardens and say that but two in a Parish offend in a Quarter of a Year that makes    Persons with the Offenders to appear What great Multitudes this will bring together what Quarrelling and Danger may happen besides giving Authority to a mean ChurchWarden how prejudicial this may be  with divers other Reasons against it and Instances of the Ambiguities and Equivocations in it and as for the Proviso newly added  it was a plain Toleration from coming to Church  and the Parson could not prevent or constrain any if they read Service at Home Hereupon it was put to the Question and the House was divided the  Yeas  went forth and were and the  Noes  within were so it was thrown out by one Voice But the  Yeas  urging they had the Speaker's Voice which would make it even this grew a Question whether he had a Vote Sir  Edward Hobby  thought he had one but Sir  Walter Ralegh  argued  that he was foreclos'd of his Voice by taking that Place which it had pleased them to impose upon him and that he was to be indifferent for both Parties  withal shewed  that by the ol  Order of the House the Bill was lost  The Speaker himself confirm'd his Observation and confess'd he had not by Custom any Vote Then Mr  B  yer  Secretary to the Lord Treasurer  Bu  khurst  would have retrieved it by suggesting  there was some foul Play deela  ing a Member was pulled back by the Sleeve as going out and charged Mr  Dale  of the  MiddleTemple  To which Sir  Walter Ralegh  answer'd in a humorous Manner  Why if it please you it is a small Matter to pull one by the Sleeve for so I have done myself oftentimes  which though a familiar Phrase for checking or reproving one's self for any Weakness or Error yet a very disingenuous and incongruous Construction was forced upon it by the Comptroller and  Cecyll  as if  large was his Conscience or very flexible that in a Matter of this Consequence would be drawn backwards or forwards by the Sleeve Ralegh  took no Notice of them and the Speaker being allowed to have no Voice the Bill was thrown up and they took their Leave of it Besides the Speeches  Ralegh  made in Parliament which we have thus drawn together as far as they are upon Record he appears in the Committees of many other Bills and in several Conferences with the Lords as may be seen in the Journal Books of both Houses but being only mention'd in general we need not here be so particular as to recite them Therefore shall only observe that the Commons having granted the Queen a liberal Subsidy and her Majesty given her Royal Assent to Nineteen publick and ten private Acts this last Parliament in her Reign was dissolv'd on the th of  December  In the Beginning of the Year Mr  Carew  's Dedication of his  Survey of Cornwall  is dated as was before intimated wherein that Author has with such Energy copied forth the most amiable Distinctions of  Ralegh  's Mind This agreeable Picture thereof and the many other noble Attitudes in which we have seen it display'd have made me inquisitive what Portraitures remained of his Person  that we might better judge of the Correspondence between them how well in one Aspect the Sprightliness of Genius consorted with the Solidity of Judgment how well in one Figure the Roughness of War with the Splendor and Magnificence of Courts I have at last had the Satisfaction of seeing these Characters united in that Portrait of Sir  Walter Ralegh  still remaining with the Descendants of his Family  'Tis in the Possession of Captain  William Elwes  Nephew of the Lacy  Elwes  Grand Daughter of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and to that Gentleman we are oblig'd for the Liberty of bringing the same into Pr nt  It is a half Length representing him in the silver Armour beforemention'd and richly adorn'd in the Skirts the Sword and Belt with Diamonds Rubies and Pearls It seems by the Darkness and Fullness of the Hair with the Freshness and Clearness of the Countenance to have been the Picture of him before his  Guianian  Expedition above related but the Inscription upon another very old Draught in the same Posture and Habit mentions his Government of  Jersey  Among the Collections of his Grace the Duke of  Dorset  at  Knowle  in  Kent  Farther to describe this Piece here will be needless since it is now brought into Sculpture by an excellent Hand and ready to be made publick Another Painting I have also seen of him and this is at full Length probably an Original It agrees very well with the Foregoing in the Form of the Face and Colour of the Hair and Beard at least as far as may be expected from the Hands of different Artists some Alteration perhaps by Repairs and some Difference of Years in the Object whereby he seems in this last more ruddy and tann'd than the other For by the Inscription thereon partly still legible it appears  that this Picture was painted in this last Year of the Queen abovementioned and that his Son  Walter  who is likewise here drawn by him was then eight Years of Age Further in this Picture the Stature of Sir  Walter Ralegh  measures about six Feet is wellshaped and not too slender He is apparell'd in a white Sattin pink'd Vest closesleev'd to the Wrist and over the Body of it a brown Doublet finely flowered and embroidered with Pearl his Belt of the same Colour and Ornament in which hangs his Sword and on the other Side over the right Hip is seen the Pommel of his Dagger In his Hat which he has on is a little black Feather with a large ruby and pearl Drop at the Bottom of the Sprig in Place of the Button His Trunks or Breeches with his Stockings and Ribbongarters fringed at the End are all white and Buffshoes tied with white Ribbons His Son standing under his left Elbow is fair and prettily featured dressed in a blue silk Jacket and Trowsers guarded down with narrow silver Galloon Stockings blue and white Shooes Gloves in the right Hand Hat or Cap in the left and a silver Sword by his Side  This Picture of Sir  Walter  and his Son did belong to the  Carews  of  Beddington  whence by Marriage with a Daughter of the late Sir  Stephen Leonard  Baronet it was removed to  WestWickham  in  Kent  near which Place at a Gentleman's Seat where there is a Copy that was taken from it I lately saw it    A Year before this the Lady  Ralegh  's Picture was also painted as appears by the Date upon it It is a halflength like the first but painted on Board a high finish'd Piece in the labour'd Manner of those Times by some masterly Hand has been well kept and is doubtless an Original It represents her a fair handsome Woman turn'd  perhaps of thirty She has on a dark colour'd hangingsleeve Robe tuffted on the Arms and under it a closebodied Gown of white Sattin flower'd with black with close Sleeves down to her Wrist has a rich Ruby in her Ear bedrop'd with large Pearls a lac'd Whisk rising above the Shoulders her Bosom uncover'd and a Jewel hanging thereon with a large Chain of Pearl round her Neck down to her Waist These are all the paintings I have seen of them that I can count authentic or most likely to bear any true Resemblance But have been credibly inform'd of a Picture of Sir  Walter Ralegh  in Miniature taken not long before his Death and another at large representing him also in a white Suit which he had beset with Jewels to the value of threescore thousand Pounds and that one Diamond thereof worth a hundred Pounds remained in the Family till the beginning of the late Queen's Reign In this Picture there is a Ribbongarter fring'd at the ends ty'd about his left Arm This according to the Tradition that remains in his Family was his Lady's otherwise might be thought one of the Queen's Favours at the  TiltYard  which he brought one Morning when he was obliged to attend her Majesty early as a Token that for Dispatch he had rode Miles since he took leave of her late the Night before But such a Number of Jewels which might be call'd Extravagance in others was no Expence to Sir  Walter Ralegh  who had many other Kinds of Treasure as well as this in  Spanish  Prizes or otherwise in Traffick with foreign Nations and as for his stately Appearance in by wearing of them upon some special Occasions it is not only confirm'd by Circumstances in part beforementioned but also by some Authors who are not expected to take Notice of it with great Commendation  yet the Jesuit  Drexelius  might perhaps have found more dazling Examples to dress out his  Dialogue  upon  Attire  nearer the Time he wrote it  As Lord  Hay  and others in King  James  's Reign but above all the Duke of  Buckingham  with whom it was common at an ordinary Dancing to have his Cloaths trimmed with great Diamond Buttons and to have Diamond Hatbands Cockades and Ear rings to be yoked with great and manifol  Ropes and Knots of Pearl in short to be manacled fettered and imprisoned in Jewels insomuch that "at his going over to  Paris  in he had Suits of Cloaths made the richest that Embroidery Lace Silk Velvet Silver Gold and Gems could contribute one of which was a white uncut Velvet set all over both Suit and Cloak with Diamonds valued at Fourscore thousand Pounds besides a great Feather stuck all over with Diamonds as were also his Sword Girdle Hatband and Spurs' This from a MS in the  Harleyan  Library  B H C fol  and to have parellel'd with the  Roman  Emperors he produces than  Ralegh  even tho' Sir  Walter  might upon some great Assemblies at Court have this very  Shoes  bedeck'd with precious Stones that exceeded the value of  six thousand six hundred Pieces of Gold  as that Author relates All I think here further observable upon the Pictures of Sir  Walter Ralegh  is that after so many which may be called genuine and many more pretended to be so still in being there have been such frequent Occasions of engraving his Effigies for his Books yet we have never had till now more than  two Sculptures  which can pretend to have taken from any paintings that even these are different from any above describ'd and that all the rest of the Copper Prints we have of him whereof near half a score might be reckon'd are Copies only from the last of those two  Of these two Sculptures or Prints of Sir  Walter Ralegh  the first is an extraordinary Rarity insomuch that many  Virtuosi  and Antiquaries who have searched after and collected the graved Heads of eminent Persons for many Years together have not so much as ever heard of it The Felicity and the Favour are therefore the greater that I have been oblig'd with the Sight of it by General  Dormer  who has procur'd a fresh and fair Impression of it from  France  into his choice and costly Collections for it is a  French  Piece in the  Octavo  Size and graved by  Thomas Leau  an Artist who was encouraged by some of our Nobility in these Times for the Excellence of his Hand It represents him in a closebodied silk Coat laced agrees pretty well in the Features with those before describ'd especially the high Forehead and cornering up of the Hair above the Right Temple It has a Compartment or Group at the Bottom displaying his Victory over the Fleet in the Bay of  Cadiz  yet in the large  Latin  Inscription expressing his Titles and Offices of Command there is Mention made of his Government of  Jersey  So I conclude it was graved between his Preferment thereto and the Queen's Death The other Print of him is that which we see prefix'd to most of the Editions of his History of the World whether to the first Edition I am not yet certain the oldest that I have seen being among the Heads annexed to  Henry Holland  's  Basilogia  was graved by  Simon Pass  in the Year representing him in a closebodied Suit thickly laced a full laced Ruff and Truncheon in his Hand Also when he was more aged and corpulent than we see him in any of those before mention'd By the visible Erasement of a long Inscription that was at the Bottom for the Substitution of that which is more brief the Plate should seem to have been graved before that Year but by the Truncheon in his Hand not till he had his Command as General for his last Expedition yet being probably taken from some anthentic Painting it lay most ready to be copied when any Print was wanting for his lesser Works This is all I shall here observe upon the Pictures of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and for much of this we are obliged to the Knowledge and Industry of the ingenious Mr  Vertue  Among the Re  t of the Particulars we shall briefly relate of Sir  Walter Ralegh  in this last Year of the Queen's Reign a Voyage which he now set out for the Supply of his Colony in  Virginia  is principally to be remembered For tho' he had made an Assignment of his Patent to other Undertakers as was before observed yet they making no successful Progress he was so regardful  of the  English  he had planted there that he sent to them almost every other year even from the Time of the said Assignment For besides the five Voyages before epitomized which himself chiefly was at the Expence of for the first Plantation of  Virginia  we are well informed of five Voyages more which since those he set forth thither for the Relief of his Countrymen as well as for further Discoveries of those Parts and Alliance with the People and that the last of these Voyages under the Command of Captain  Samuel Mace  was made this Year In all which Sir  Walter Ralegh  might very well have disbursed forty thousand Pounds as was before observed since in a  French  Author I have found the two first Voyages only to  Virginia  cost him and his Friends threescore thousand Crowns yet were not the  English  so securely established in this most promising Plantation as Sir  Walter Ralegh  would have had them for from the short Account we have of this last Voyage and other Circumstances we may observe the said Colony was much impaired by the barbarous  Indians  as indeed  Ralegh  's Purse seems also to have been by these frequent Communications to it Nor was it without much Blood as well as Money that this Settlement was at last fixed by the succeeding Undertakers in the next Reign and all owing to the want of that timely and competent Assistance from the Queen or State whereby the most worthy Attempts for the Publick Good were even in these as well as other Times so generally starved But  Ralegh  afterwards gave some emphatical Reasons for this Unhappiness whence we may evidently perceive it was to the Queen's consulting so much and relying upon the Persuasions of her  Scribes  Men unexperienced in all warlike or adventurous Enterprizes narrow domestick Politicians or mere Courtiers  who were most constant at her Ear that she so frequently  did Things by halves  as well in Conquests and Discoveries as in Rewards and Preferments especially of Military Men  'That her Majesty in her Advancement of her Men of War says Sir  Walter Ralegh  did sooner believe other Men than herself a Disease unto which many wise Princes besides herself have been subject I say that such a Confidence altho' it may  eem altogether to excuse her noble Nature yet can it not but in some sort accuse her of Weakness And exceeding strange it were were not the Cause manifest enough that  where the prosperous Actions are so exceedingly priz'd▪ the Actors are so unprosperous and neglected  The Cause I say which hath wrought one and the same Effect in all Times▪ and among all Nations is this that those who are nearest the Person of Princes which martial Men seldom are can with no good Grace commend or at least magnify a Profession far more noble than their own seeing therein they should only remind their Masters of the Wrong they did unto others in giving less Honour and Reward to Men of far greater Deserving and far greater Use than themselves'  History of the World  lib cap sect  Thus those speculative Counsellors though they could not hinder brave and active Spirits from budding out into noble Beginnings of most hopeful Benefit to the Commonwealth yet could by stopping the Channel of Supplies or Encouragements  blite  them from advancing to any fruitful or profitable Conclusions and this only to bring down those of superior Service and Merit to a Level with themselves  Whether the Expence of those Voyages was the Cause of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's selling about this Time his Estate or some part of it in  Ireland  is not so expresly told us as that it was become less advantageous to him since the late Rebellion in that Kingdom But we find that a little before Sir  George Carew  now President of  Munster  took the Castle of  Carigfoyl Kerry  Mr  Richard Boyle  afterwards Earl of  Cork  not only bought a Ship  of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's called the  Pilgrim  but soon after the said President conquered  Berehaven  Castle he having advised the said Mr  Boyle  to buy also Sir  Walter  's Lands in  Munster  sent him into  England  with two Letters the one to Secretary  Cecyll  giving an Account of Mr  Boyle  's Abilities desired that he would introduce him to Sir  Walter Ralegh  and recommended him to this great Man says my Author as a proper Purchaser of his said Lands the other Letter was written by Sir  George Carew  to Sir  Walter Ralegh  himself acquainting him that the Bearer was capable of making the Purchase and that he thought he might be willing to dispose of it since the Management thereof in those turbulent Times gave him a great deal of Trouble and the Income it produced was very inconsiderable so after a Meeting the Bargain was struck up and Conveyances executed These Lands soon after in the peaceable Times became a great Estate to Mr  Boyle  and this Purchase as he afterwards gratefully remembered in the  Memoirs  he wrote of his own  Life  when he was Earl of  Cork was the third Addition and Rise to his Estate  See an Extract of the said  Memoirs  in the Life of the late Earl of  Orrery  by  Eustace Budgell  Esq vo p But it seems the said Earl of  Cork  was afterwards sadly plunder'd of his great Estate for at the breaking out of the  Civil Wars  he wrote these Words in a letter to another Nobleman▪  "Thus your Lordship sees in what miserable Condition we are fighting Night and Day to preserve ourselves and our Castles for all we had without Doors is lost and poor I that besides my House Demesne Parks Ironworks Fishings and other Commodities had a Revenue of  fifty Pounds per diem  cannot now truly say that I have  fifty Pounds per Ann  in certain Revenue"  Thus in the Earl of  Cork  's Letter to the Lord  Newbourgh  Chancellor of the  Exchequer  in  Ireland  MS in the  Harleyan  Library B H C sol    As for the Estate at  Sherborne  it appears he now settled it upon his Son  Walter  and that the Deeds were drawn in  Midsummer  this present Year for so we have it from has own Words This Settlement as I understand it was of the Remainder of the Lease for Years For though the Bishop of  Sarum  Dr  Henry Cotton  had the last Year assigned over to the Queen the Fee and Inheritance also of the said Premises and her Majesty granted the same by her Letters Patent to Sir  Walter Ralegh  before her Death yet he did not make them over to his Son 'till the seventh Year of her Successor The Reason of settling his Estate upon his Son at this Time appears also to have risen from a Challenge which he had lately received from Sir  Amias Preston  who had been knighted at  Cadiz  by the Earl of  Essex  since we last spoke of him and which  Ralegh  says himself  he intended to answer  The Cause of their Quarrel I never could meet with in Print or Manuscript yet conceive  Ralegh  had good Reason on his Side because he afterwards shewed publickly himself how deliberate he was in his Preparations for it by sorting his Writings and how resolved by settling his Estate But from what excellent Hands soever Dr  Fuller  received his Information that upon some distaste Sir  Amias  sent  Ralegh  this Challenge we may be pretty certain from what  Ralegh  has mention'd that the said Information or this Author's Account of it is erroneous where he adds  That Sir  Walter  declined it  Indeed I agree he might do so  with ut any Abatement to his Valour wherein he had abundantly satisfied all Possibility of Suspicion and with great Advancement of his Judgment for having continues  Fuller  a fair and fixed Estate with Wife and Children Child he should have said being a PrivyCounsellor here he mistakes again  and Lordwarden of  the  Stannaries  my said Author thinks  Sir  Walter  looked upon it as an uneven Lay to stake himself against Sir  Amias  a private and single Person though of good Birth and Courage yet of no considerable Estate  But if  Ralegh  did accept of the Challenge as it appears plainly he did when he might have had such fair Reason of Evasion those Inequalities in  Preston  will either prove Sir  Walter  a generous Adversary or that the Injury he received from Sir  Amias  was indispensable Now this Representation seems to have been officiously and unnecessarily shaped to make  Ralegh  's Actions conformable with his Writings for continues our said Author  this is consonant to what he has written so judiciously about Duels condemning those for ill Honours where the Hangman gives the Garland  This curious and copious Digression against Duels which that Author alludes to is in Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  History of the World  lib V cap III S XVII sect Sir  Walter  has also in his  Instructions to his Son  written a Chapter against  Private Quarrels  in which he no less wisely than bravely says▪  'Thou shalt be in as much Danger in contending with a Brawler in a private Quarrel as in a Battle wherein thou may'st get Honour to thyself and Safety to thy Prince and Country but if thou be once engaged carry thyself bravely that they may fear thee after' And a little further▪ I would not have thee for any respect lofe thy Reputation or endure publick Disgrace for better it were not to live than to live a Coward if the Offence proceed not from thyself if it does it shall be better to compound it upon good Terms than to hazard thyself for if thou overcome thou art under the Cruelty of the Law if thou art overcome thou art dead or dishonoured c'  However they were afterwards reconciled as  Fuller  concludes and upon the whole Sir  Walter Ralegh  seems to have shewn a much more creditable Conduct herein than Sir  Francis Vere  a little while before had done in the Difference between him and a certain Nobleman  But here we are no longer to take Notice of such open Adversaries for now in the very Close of this Year on the th of  March  ends the long Reign of glorious  Elizabeth  and now sets the Sun of  Ralegh  's external Honour and Felicity yet like that ever active Planet will shine resplendently to the Heavens when he is clouded or eclipsed to Mankind How he fell into this Eclipse Record the only Luminary of Time past does but dimly or doubtfully discover All we can do is diligently to assemble every unextinguish'd Spark which darts any Light this Way then see if they will afford that Guidance to the Truth by being congregated which they have not yet been observed to yield asunder And first we may remember to have before read of the Prepossessions which  Essex  is affirm'd to have instill'd unto King  James  against  Ralegh  and after the Earl's Death there are several Circumstances imploying that  Cecyll  did the like For tho'  Cecyll  and  Ralegh  join'd against  Essex  and his Faction yet when these were overthrown they divided and seem to have had a Trial of Skill with one another And one Author says that  Ralegh  wanting Strength tho' not Wit to be the Treasurer's Rival  perished because not thought to own Humility enough to be his Servant it being more safe at Court to have many Enemies of equal Power than one false ambitious Friend that has attained to the Absoluteness of Command  In short  Cecyll  seems to have used those Arts of Insinuation with King  James  before his coming into  England  to which  Ralegh  could not bend himself That he then held clandestine Correspondences with  Scotland  is apparent from that Story in Sir  Henry Wotton  who tells us  that her Majesty taking the Air on  Blackheath  attended by  Cecyll  when the Post rode by and hearing he came  from  Scotland  she called for his Packet  Cecyll  though he knew it contained Letters which to discover were as so many Serpents yet making more shew of Diligence than Doubt to obey called in great Haste for a Knife to rip it up but approaching at some Distance with it he told the Queen it looked and smelled so illfavour'dly coming out of the filthy Budget that it must needs be aired first because he knew how offensive ill Scents were to her Majesty So got Opportunity to separate what he would not have seen  and she smelt nothing of the Matter One Talent above the Rest  Cecyll  was not wanting in to recommend him to this new Sovereign and this was such a Faculty of discovering Plots as if he thought he should be looked on as useless without them  For as a noble Author observes  It seemed as necessary for him that there should be Treasons as for the State that they should be prevented And though he created none yet he fomented some Conspiracies that he might give frequent Evidences of his Loyalty having not the Advantage of others in Person to gain Estimation therefore did it by these eminent Services  And as for King  James  he was so apprehensive so susceptible of such Impressions that when he was but cross'd or disturb'd in his Sports he would charge People with Treason Nay we are particularly told by those who were otherwise Friends to his Memory that his Carver once at Table giving him accidentally a Nick on the Finger as he was routing in the Dish his Majesty at the Sight of his own Blood could not forbear calli ng out Treason and that  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  was wont to make himself merry with this Expression And all this instanced by my said Author to shew that for any Clamour of this Kind King  James  's  Word  was no  Slander  But more directly to our purpose there is another Writer who  making some critical Enquiry into the Preliminaries of Sir  Walter  's Fall  says  Sir Robert Cecyll  principal Secretary of State fearing the great Abilities of  Ralegh  and being wearied with the troublesome Impertinences of  Gray  and  Cobham  all which had joined with him in Design against the Earl of  Essex  their common Enemy  had done their Errand to King  James  whose Counsels he desired to engross to himself alone before his coming into  England And when the King was arrived there was Matter enough to exasperate  Cecyll  against  Ralegh  if through any Design of Recrimination Sir  Walter  did present to his Majesty  a Memorial  wherein he reflected heavily upon  Cecyll  in the matter of  Essex  and vindicating himself threw the whole Blame upon the other further laying open at the End thereof the Conduct of  Cecyll  and his Father also in the Matter of the Queen of  Scots his Majesty's Mother  bitterly charging the Death of this unfortunate Queen upon them  However says my Author  this had no Influence over the King and only irritated  Cecyll  the more against  Ralegh  But what seems sufficient to have incensed the King also against  Ralegh  was his being of that Party who in Regard of the inveterate Feuds between  England  and  Scotland  desired the King might be obliged to Articles for as another writes  among these noble and publick Spirits were Sir  John Fortescue  Sir  Walter Ralegh  the Lord  Cobham  c all frowned upon after by the King who had yet the Luck to live so long as to change his Opinion and wish the Number of his Countrymen had been limited and they not suffer'd like Locusts to devour this Kingdom  There were not wanting still other particulars which might render  Ralegh  obnoxious to a Man of the King's jealous Disposition  for he had  at the Time of his Majesty's  Accession to the Throne  the Daughter and Heir of  Basset  to his Ward who was to be married to his Son  Walter  her Estate worth    l  per Annum  but she was after his Condemnation we suppose taken from him and married to Mr  Henry Howard  who died suddenly at Table and she was afterwards married to the Earl of  Newcastle  who profess'd he would never have wedded her if young  Walter Ralegh  had been alive conceiving her before God to be his Wife for they were married as much as Children could be  Now these  Bassets  as we find elsewhere were those of  Umberlegh  and  Heanton Court  in  Devonshire  who being descended from the  Plantagenets  laid some Claim at this very Time of the King's Entrance to the Crown of  England  Sir  Robert Basset  by his Grandmother descended from the  Plantagenets  and of the Blood Royal in the Beginning of King  James  's Reign made some Pretensions to the Crown of  England  but not being able to make them good was forced to fly into  France  to save his Head to compound for which together with his generous Way of Living he greatly exhausted his Estate selling off no less than Manors of Land tho' there is now a fair Estate belonging to the Heir of the Family  Prince's Worthies of Devon  fol  See also  Wood  's Ath Oxon vol I col  But whatever Discountenance  Ralegh  might receive at his first Meeting of the King in his Journey from  Scotland  Sir  Richard Baker  's Chronicle Also Sir  John Hawles  in his Reply to the  Magistracy  and  Government  of  England vindicated  c Fol more expresly says  "Cobham  and  Ralegh  were not permitted to come at the King upon his Journey into  England  and had Word sent them  they might spare their Labour"  But  Stow  says when the King came towards  York  his Train increased by such Numbers of Gentleman from the South as made Provisions so dear that he was fain to publish an Inhibit on against the inordinate Access So that many were stopp'd in their Way Thus perhaps the Countermand might not be particular of any Person however some as we see apply it to  Ralegh  as others have also done to  Cobham  affirming the King check'd him for his Absence from his Charge at that dangerous Time being then LordWarden of the  CinquePorts  whence he set out on the th of  April  and arrived at  Theobalds  which  was  Cecyll  's Seat on the d of  May  and at  London  four Days after it seems not to have amounted to a peremptory Dismission from his Majesty's Service or Presence For we are told  the King used  Ralegh  for some Weeks with great Kindness and was pleased to acknowledge divers Presents which he had received from him being in  Scotland  for which he gave him Thanks But finding him a martial Man addicted to foreign Affairs and great Actions he feared left he should engage him in a War  That  Ralegh  was in Company with the King and that some of his Conversation turned upon this Subject we have from his own Words where he says  I offer'd his Majesty at my Uncle  Carew's  to carry    Men to invade the  Spaniards  without the King's Charge  And this agrees with his writing a Discourse which he did or intended to deliver to his Majesty  against the Peace with  Spain now in Treaty which seems to be the same that was Years afterwards publish'd by his Grandson Herein he advised his Majesty to protect the  Netherlands  for says he  a poor Neighbour's House set on Fire is to be better guarded or watched than a great City afar off  Herein he persuades the King to deliberate and not come to a hasty Conclusion of Peace with the  Spaniards for when the House is built it is ill mending the Foundation  Herein he says  I dare not write all I desire for I know not to whose Hands these may come This I beseech your Majesty to know that it proceeds from an humble and a faithful Heart which your Majesty cannot beat from the Love of your Royal Person and good Estate  And lastly I shall  observe that herein he also mentions another Discourse  how War may be made against  Spain  and the  Indies  which I will says he also present your Majesty if you will vouchsafe the reading thereof  but this I think has never appear'd in Print The former of these Discourses is humbly and discreetly address'd with Variety of Arguments and Observations from his own Knowledge and Experience also strengthened with many historical Examples of Foreign Countries and political Maxims or Sentences from the antient Classicks All which he had plentifully at Command in any Topic he undertook to write or even speak of Such the Extensiveness of his Remarks and his Reading such the Felicity of his Memory and Talents of Application But if Reason would have prevail'd it was not wanting also from other Hands so that Sir  Walter Ralegh  was not singular in his Dissuasions of the King but had the Satisfaction of seeing Foreigners as well as his own Countrymen subscribe to his Senitments and the Lord  Henry Howard  tho' otherwise brought into the CourtMeasures yet could not it seems consent to these of a general Pacification therefore was as well as  Ralegh  excluded from the Benefit of those rich Presents which the Marquis of  Rosny  Ambassador from  France  made to all those Courtiers who promoted the same insomuch that  Howard  being ask'd by the King  How it happen'd he had not a Jewel as well as the rest  Answer'd in Allusion to  Esop  's Fable  Non sum  Gallus  itaque non reperi  Gemmam The Causes which moved the King of  Spain  to sue for this Peace  Ralegh  did afterwards with great Perspicuity lay open  Ralegh  lays down five Reasons for the King of  Spain  's making this Peace with  England  and the  Netherlands  "As first his having so exhausted his Treasure that he was no longer able to maintain the Archduke's Army  Secondly  the great Interruption of his Trade and Losses of his Merchants to the breaking of both his Banks at  Seville Thirdly  his Fear that the  English  and  Netherlanders  would plant in the  WestIndies Fourthly  to recruit his Coffers and enable himself to break into War again  Fifthly  that the  English  may decline and forget the Passages and Pilctage to the  WestIndies  and their SeaOfficers may be worn out for except a little Trade for Tobacco there is not a Ship that sails that Way And seeing the Spaniards  may hang up the  English▪ or put them to Death by Torments as they do and that the  English  dare not offend the  Spaniards  in those Parts a most notable Advantage gotten in the Conclusion of the Peace it is certain that the  English  will give over that Navigation to the infinite Advantage of the  Spanish  King both present and future For these Causes of Importance it was that the Catholic King sought the Peace of  England  and the  Netherlands  and so much all Men of Judgment discern" See these Reasons more at large in Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  Dialogue  between a  Jesuit  and a  Recusan    among the  genuine Remains  publish'd at the End os an Abridgment of his  History of the World  by  Philip Ralegh  Esq vo  but his present  Opposition of it and the Consequences of that seem to have been the Hinges upon which his whole Fortune now turn'd I say the most apparent Cause to me of all those Sorrows and Sufferings which fill up the melancholy Remains of his Story This unfortunate Event which he was above shunning by trimming and temporising in a Matter which he knew so highly concern'd the Honour and Advantage of his Country he has himself so excellently accounted for where he shews the ill Success which attends such sincere Conduct and how Prosperity is the Fruit of slavish or hypocritical Compliances  In a curious Discourse where he Learnedly and Religiously reconciles Fortune with Reason and Providence  Ralegh  has these Words "But may it be objected that if  Fortune  and  Chance  were not sometimes the Causes of  Good  and  Evil  in Men but an idle Voice whereby we express  Success  how comes it then that so many worthy and wise Men depend upon so many unworthy and emptyheaded Fools That Riches and Honour are given to external Men and without Kernel and so many Learned Virtuous and Valiant Men wear out their Lives in poor and dejected Estates In a Word there is no other inferior or apparent Cause besides the Partiality of Men's Affection but  the Fashioning and not Fashioning ourselves according to the Nature of the Times wherein we live  For whosoever is most able and best sufficient to discern and has withal an honest and open Heart and loving Truth if Princes or those who Govern endure no other Discourse than their own Flatteries then I say such a one whose Virtue and Courage forbids him to be base and a Dissembler shall evermore hang under the Wheel which kind of deserving well and receiving ill we always falsely charge Fortune withal For whosoever shall tell any Great Man or Magistrate that he is not Just the General of an Army that he is not Valiant and great Ladies that they are not Fair shall never be made a Counsellor a Captain or a Courtier Neither is it sufficient to be Wise with a Wise Prince Valiant with a Valiant and Just with him that is Just for such a one has no Estate in his Prosperity but he must also  change with the Successor  if he be of  contrary Qualities  sail with the Tide of the Time and alter Form and Condition as the State or Statesmaster changes Otherwise how were it possible that the most base Men and separate from all imitable Qualities could so often attain to Honour and Riches but by such an observant slavish Course" A little further having quoted out of  Menander  "That every Fool is won with his own Pride and the flattering Applause of others he infers That whosoever will live altogether out of himself study other Men's Humours and observe them shall never be Unfortunate On the contrary that Man who prizes Truth and Virtue except the Season wherein he lives be of these and all Sorts of Goodness Fruitful shall never prosper by the Possession or Profession thereof" So after other learned Authorities and proper Examples concludes with the following ingenious Allusions "Whosoever therefore will set before him  Machiavel  's two  Marks  to shoot at  Riches  and  Glory  must set on and take off a back of Iron to a weak Wooden Bow that he may fit both the Strong and the Feeble For as he who first devised to add Sails to rowing Vessels did either so proportion them as being fastened aloft and towards the Head of his Mast he might abide all Winds and Storms or else he some Time or other perish'd by his own Invention So that Man who prizes Virtue for itself and cannot endure to hoist and strike Sail as the divers Natures of Calms and Storms require must cut his Sails and his Cloth of mean Length and Breadth and content himself with a slow and sure Navigation to wit a mean and free Estate" Sir  Walter Ralegh  's History of the World  lib I cap sect  that I could not but from the  said Occasion of the greatest Vicissitude in his Life form the Introduction to this Account of it  Thus have we seen several Circumstances and these are all I have met with in this Interval whereby  Ralegh  might undesignedly and unluckily become disagreeable to a Man of King  James  's Temper but on the other side little or nothing that could so inflame  Ralegh  against the King as to make him run headlong into such violent Conspiracies as could only end in his own Ruin Suppose the King did discourage  Ralegh  's Attendance upon him at his Entrance dislike his Patent for Wines or removed him from the Guards to oblige Sir  Thomas Erskine  his Countryman and Favourite whom he afterwards prefer'd to higher Dignities and this is all I have met with that could give Offence on the King's part will this be thought sufficient Provocation for a Man of  Ralegh  's Reason and Judgment so tender of Fame and Reputation so settled in Family so well situated in his Fortune no less than  l  a Year as was confess'd at his Trial besides many other profitable and I may say princely Possessions on the Seas as well as the Land to plot Commotions or Insurrections yet enervate himself for the Execution of them by resigning as he says himself he did his Office of chiefest Power the Wardship of the  Stannaries  Nay further to herd with a motley and disjointed Crew of Priests also with profess'd Enemies to himself not to mention Knaves and Fools and on a sudden resolve to turn Rebel Ru  ian and Cutthroat to be the  Coryphaeus  to murder the King with his own Hand and all his innocent Progeny for this is the Charge that the fertile Pens of  French  Writers have heap'd upon him Indeed I was somewhat startled when I read it in a History that bears the Name and Character of  Thuanus  though I thought he might possibly come at it by ministerial Direction to an  English  Resident till at last I found his Author to be no other than one of his own Countrymen whom  Camden  as I have before observ'd has refuted in other Passages that are even more credible Now these tell over this desperate Story thus In the Month of  June  Sir  Walter Ralegh a Man equally dexterous at Consultation or Action  says Thuanus  and famous for his memorable Expeditions to the  Indies taking Leave of his Sister at  London  intreated her to commend him to God in her Prayers for he was going to a Place from whence he expected never to return She suspecting that he was going to fight a Duel with the same Levity dispersed it among the Ladies of her Acquaintance 'till the Rumour came to Court Then  Ralegh  's Friends and Relations flocked about him to know this Enterprise he apprehending himself detected readily made a whole Confession and Discovery of the Matter The King was informed and greatly astonished but would needs have  Ralegh  before him who then asking his Pardon acknowledg'd that seeing his Majesty give more Countenance to the  Scots  than the  English  and had deprived him of his Command in the Guards and that many great Men expected when he was established on the Throne he would be revenged for the Death of his Mother he had therefore entered into a Conspiracy with others whom he named to shed his Royal Blood and that they had unanimously deputed him to be his Majesty's Executioner when  he rode a hunting Hereupon the said Conspirators were taken up and tried as these Authors proceed to relate If there had been any Truth in this ridiculous Story which I think no one before has taken the Pains to relate in  English  that Confession had neither escaped the Attorney General  Coke  at  Ralegh  's Trial when they were so lamely put to it to bring him in guilty without sufficient Proof nor King  James  'sapologetical Declaration after  Ralegh  's Death in which his Majesty and his Council together have no less lamely offered weaker Reasons for taking away his Life as will be fully represented in its proper Place  By our  English  Accounts it appears there was somewhat of a Plot but it was never proved that  Ralegh  was engaged in it however his great Enemy the Attorneygeneral  Coke  affected to compare him with the Conspirators  to  Sampson  's Foxes which were joined in the Tails though their Heads were severed  What Share he had in that Plot may further be judged by the Promotions which the Conspirators intended themselves upon the Success of it for whereas one was to be Lordchancellor another Lordmarshal this Lordtreasurer that Master of the Horse and t'other Secretary of State how comes it as one Author well observes that  Ralegh  able to officiate any had no Office in the State assign'd him But perhaps the best Means to clear him may be the very  Trial  by which he was condemn'd 'Tis too common and too tedious to be thought needful of transcribing it here at length not to say so full of barbarous Partiality and foul Language especially by  Coke  himself that he was exposed for it upon the publick Theatre and those who revere the Laws of our Country have been so ashamed of it as rather to wish the Proceedings have been falsely related than believe  such a Sentence could pass upon such insufficient Evidence But the Character of this  Trial  and of that  Attorney General  I leave to others and shall here only from the several Copies or Accounts of it I have met with draw out a short regular Narrative of the most material Matters of Fact wherein  Ralegh  appears any way concern'd and it is as follows  There was one  Matthew de Laurencie  a Merchant of  Antwerp  Attendant on Count  Aremberg  who now about the Beginning of  June  came over Ambassadorextraordinary from  Albert  Archduke of  Austria  to congratulate King  James  and assist in composing the General Peace With this Merchant the Lord  Cobham  had held Intelligence some Years before upon Matters of State with Licence Five Days after  Aremberg  's Arrival that is to say about the th of the same Month  Cobham  repair'd to him with  Laurencie  and that Night  Cobham  supp'd with Sir  Walter Ralegh  at  Durhamhouse  in the  Strand  whereby  Ralegh  came to understand that  Cobham  had fresh Negociations with  Aremberg  and was as the chief of those who refused the Peace offered a Sum of Money by  Cobham  to be a Promoter of it tho' that Offer also made to  Ralegh  before  Aremberg  came was afterwards pretended as will appear to have been for treasonable Purposes In the next Month those Persons with whom  Cobham  transacted the Conspiracy or part of it then on foot were discover'd either by the  Spanish  Faction in revenge to  Ralegh  the greatest Enemy of  Spain  alive thinking he was then too far hamper'd in or acquainted with it to escape or by some one of the  English  Conspirators to secure himself And when the Lord  Cecyll  for he was lately made Baron of  Essenden  found upon the first News of  Anthony Copley  one of these  Conspirators who was apprehended the th of  July  that the King's Person was to be surpriz'd by the Lord  Grey  of  Wilton  and  George Brook  Brother to the Lord  Cobham  he suspected  Cobham  himself was in the Secret and  Cobham  's great Intimacy with  Ralegh  at this Time who was now buying an Estate for him and settling his Houshold Affairs drew  Ralegh  also into Suspicion  Hereupon  Cecyll  meeting  Ralegh  upon  Windsor  Terrace tells him  the Lords of the Council had something to say to him  so he was examined about the surprising Treason and particularly about  Cobham  as appears from his own Words whom he fully cleared After Examination  Ralegh  further said  Whatsoever Correspondence there was between  Cobham  and  Aremberg Laurencie  might be better able to give Account of it therefore advised to the calling upon him  though as he further explained  he knew of no Intelligence between them but such as might be warranted  And that Advice he wrote also in a Letter to  Cecyll  When  Ralegh  returned from Examination a private Prisoner to his own House  Cobham  sent him to know what had pass'd  Ralegh  writ an Answer by Capt  Feymis that he was examin'd and had clear'd him of all  and  Keymis  bid  Cobham be of good Comfort for one Witness could not condemn him  This Precaution to arm  Cobham  against making Discoveries was after his Confession of it objected against  Ralegh  but he utterly deny'd that he sent any such verbal Message Now when  Cobham  was brought to his Examination at  Richmond  one Date whereof appears to have been  July  and after he had by a constant Denial cleared both himself and  Ralegh  of all that was question'd against them  Cobham  was by Device says my Author in an Epistolary Narrative of his Trial at which he was present induced  to think that  Ralegh  had first impeach'd and betray'd him For that Part of  Ralegh  's Letter aforesaid to  Cecyll  referring the Lords to  Laurencie  for  Cobham  's Transactions with  Aremberg  being shewed to  Cobham  and accompanied it seems with such artful Suggestions as were proper to inflame a Man of  Cobham  's Weakness had the desired Effect for he being led thereby to imagine that  Ralegh  had accus'd him of all or more than he knew burst out into vehement Exclamations against  Ralegh  and in his Rage or Madness made the following Confession  That having a Passport to go to the  Spanish  King he intended first to confer with the Archduke and because he knew he had not Money to pay his own Army meant from thence to go to  Spain  to deal with the King for    Crowns then to return by  Jersey  and that nothing should be done about the Distribution of that Money to the Discontented in  England  till he had spoken with Sir  Walter Ralegh  Further that he had never enter'd into these Courses but by his Instigation He spake also of Plots but of the Particulars could give no Account yet acknowledg'd he was afraid that  Ralegh  upon his Return to  Jersey  would have him and the Money to the King  After all this before  Cobham  departed to the Stairfoot he retracted his Confession and profess'd he had done  Ralegh  wrong Nor does it appear says my Author that he did subscribe it In another Branch of his Examination  Cobham  said he had of  Ralegh  a Book written against the King's Title which he gave to his Brother  Brook  and that  Ralegh  said it was foolishly written But this he also retracted as we shall hear Upon this and other Parts of his Confession more foreign to  Ralegh  concerning the Advancement of Lady  Arabella Stuart  to the Crown as also from that of  George Brook  a known Enemy  to  Ralegh  as  Cecyll  could not deny  asserting his Brother  Cobham  told him tho'  Cobham  in his Confession refused to own it the Lord  Grey  and others were only on the  bye  but he and  Ralegh  were on the  main  thereby meaning said  Brook  the taking away of the King and his Issue  together with what  Ralegh  acknowledg'd in his own Examination  That  Cobham  offer'd him    Crowns for his Furtherance of the Peace tho' the Lord  Cecyll  and Earl of  Northumberland  were to have the same Proffers  and that in some Discourses he might have said  the Way to invade  England  was to begin with Stirs in  Scotland Upon these Circumstances I say  Ralegh  was indicted at  Stanes  on the st of  September  following and from hence that heavy Indictment appears to have been accumulated upon him which we see prefixed to his Trial Three Days afterwards  Cobham  and  Grey  were also indicted at the same Place and not long after this they were all three return'd Prisoners to the Tower of  London  When the Time of their Trial drew nigh that is to say in the Beginning of  November Ralegh  got a poor Fellow in the Tower to cast up a Letter fasten'd to an Apple in at  Cobham  's Window while the Lieutenant was at Supper to intreat him because he then knew not but  Cobham  might be arraign'd before him  for God's sake to do him Justice by his Answer and signify to him that he had wronged him in his Accusation  and  Cobham  did by an Answer under his Hand confess the same which not being perhaps so full and expressive as  Ralegh  expected he afterwards sent  Cobham  another Letter desiring he would publish his Innocence at his Arraignment But notwithstanding that  Ralegh  did not now request any further Justification under his Hand  Cobham  sent him another Answer clearing him in the most  solemn and perfect Manner as will presently appear Now by Reason of the Plague which raged so violently in and about  London  the Term having been proclaim'd to be held at  Winchester  the State Prisoners who were thus indicted for the Plot were conveyed thither in great Pomp I find that  Ralegh  went in his own Coach under the Custody of Sir  Robert Mansell  on the th of  November  to  Bagshot  in  Surrey  twenty four Miles from  London  and two Days after from thence the other thirty Miles to the Castle at  Winchester  The Conspirators conducted thither at the same Time were  George Brook  under the Charge of Sir  William Wade  Sir  Griffin Markham  under Sir  Robert Worth  besides Sir  Edward Parham Bartholomew Brookshy Anthony Copley  also  William Watson  and  William Clark  two Priests Underwardens of the  Tower  and the Keeper of the  Gatehouse  together with a Guard of fifty Light Horse As for  Cobham  and  Grey  they set out six Days and arrived three Days before at the said Castle under the like Guard  And here  Cobham  having been prevailed on to make fresh Accusations in a Letter to the Lords at least subscrib'd with his Name which will be produced a little further  Ralegh  's Trial was first brought on and this was on the th of the Month aforesaid He excepted not against his Jury being all Strangers But we are told by one who seems to have had good Intelligence of this Matter  That there was appointed for  Ralegh  another Jury the Foreman of which was Sir  Michael Stanhope  the next Sir  Edward Darcy  the next Sir  William Killegrew  all Men of Honour and near Servants to the late Queen  Elizabeth  But these being found not for their Turn they were all changed over Night and those others named in  the common Printed Trial put in their Places  After the Indictment had been opened and aggravaed Serjeant  Heath  and Attorney  Coke  in Speeches manifestly fathering the Treasons of the Rest upon  Ralegh  for no other Reason that I can see but because  he was a Man of Wit and a Swordsman Cobham  's Examination was read as before quoted Here  Ralegh  first shewed the Unreasonableness and Improbability of the Accusation therein against him as follows  It is strange for me  said he  to devise with  Cobham  that he should go to  Spain  to persuade the King to disburse so much Money he being a Man of no Love in  England  and I having resigned my Room of chiefest Command the Wardenship of the  Stannaries  it is strange for me to make myself a  Robin Hood  or a  Ket  or a  Cade  I knowing  England  to be in a better State than ever it was I knew  Scotland  united  Ireland  quieted  Denmark  assured which before was suspected I knew that having a Lady whom Time had surprised we had now a lawful Successor The State of  Spain  was not unknown to me I had written a Discourse which I intended to present unto the King against the Peace with  Spain  I knew the  Spaniard  had six Repulses three in  Ireland  and three at Sea and once in    by my Lordadmiral also at  Cadiz  I knew he was discouraged and dishonoured I knew the King of  Spain  to be the proudest Prince living but now he comes creeping to my Master for a Peace I knew whereas he had before in his Ports six or seven Score Sail of Ships he has now but six or seven I knew of twentyfive Millions he had from his  Indies  he has scarce one left I knew him so poor that the Jesuits in  Spain  were fain to beg at the Churchdoor Was it ever read or heard that any Prince should disburse so much Money without a sufficient Pawn I knew her own Subjects the Citizens  of  London  would not lend her Majesty Money without Lands in Mortgage I knew the Queen did not lend the States Money without  Flushing Brill  and other Towns for a Pawn and can it be thought he would let  Cobham  have so great a Sum I never came to the Lord  Cobham  's but about Matters of his Profit as the ordering of his House and I had of his when I was examined four thousand Pounds worth of Jewels for a Purchase a Pearl of three thousand Pounds and a Ring worth five hundred Pounds If he had had a Fancy to run away he would not have left so much Money to have purchased a Lease in Feefarm I saw him buy three hundred Pounds worth of Books to send to his Library at  Canterbury  and a Cabinet of three hundred Pounds to give Mr  Attorney  for drawing the Conveyances and God in Heaven knows not I whether he intended to travel But for the Practice with  Arabella  or Letters to  Aremberg  or any Discourse with him or in what Language he spake unto him if I knew any of these Things I would absolutely confess the Indictment and acknowledge myself worthy of a thousand Deaths  And a little further concerning  Cobham  's Examination  He that hath been examined has ever been asked if it be according to his Meaning and then to subscribe Methinks my Lords when he accuses a Man he should give some Account and Reason of it it is not sufficient to say we talked of it If I had been the Plotter would not I have given  Cobham  some Arguments whereby to persuade the King of  Spain  and answer his Objections I knew  Westmoreland  and  Bothwell  Men of other Understandings than  Cobham  were ready to beg their Bread  Here being obstructed by other Matters the Attorney fell at last into that Passage of  Cobham  's telling  Brook You are on the Bye  Ralegh  and I are on the Main  But  Cobham  would not confirm  his ever having said such Words  Brook  who had pretended he did say them was allowed to have been  Ralegh  's Enemy so the Expression was not proved Another Matter they kept some Coil about was the Book  Cobham  said he had of  Ralegh  written against the King's Title This was nothing more than a  Defence of the Queen's Proceedings against  Mary  Queen of  Scotland written by one  Robert Snag  a Lawyer and found by  Ralegh  in the Library of the late Lordtreasurer  Burghley  which he had Liberty of searching for some geographical Descriptions of the  WestIndies Ralegh  had declared to  Cobham  that it was foolishly written but denied that he gave it him and though  Cobham  in his Examination said it was given him by  Ralegh  he revoked that Confession upon being further questioned about it as one of the Lords of the Council own'd and said the Truth was  he took the same of himself out of Sir  Walter Ralegh's  Study when he was asleep  so much to be depended on were Lord  Cobham  's Accusations But there was nothing acted thereby to the King's Prejudice for the Book was burnt As for the Evidence of a Rumour in  Lisbon  brought into Court by one  Dyer  a Pilot who answering to a Question  when the King would be crowned  made by somebody or other there that  he hoped 'twould be shortly  was told again  it should never be for Don  Ralegh  and Don  Cobham  would cut his Throat first Ralegh  made light of it as of such a Rumour and such a Witness he might and said  If  Cobham  had Practice with  Aremberg  it might well be known abroad And that the Duke of  Buckingham  was named with  Jack Straw  's Treason to countenance it  But none of these little Circumstances were much insisted on and we are told by one who was present that  touching the setting up of  Arabella  nothing at all was proved nor touching the Invasion here or Sedition in  Scotland  or even the Destruction of the King c The Proof against  Ralegh  as the same Writer continues a little further did rest only upon  Cobham  's Accusation and some Presumptions whereof that only was the Ground therefore  Ralegh  spent most of the Time in disabling that Accusation as being only utter'd in Fury and Passion  through the Device aforesaid of making  Cobham  believe that  Ralegh  had first accused him Besides that he had renounced and repented it and altho'  afterwards by Practice says my said Author he did affirm it yet would he never be brought to set his Hand to the Examination all which was clear  Then  Ralegh  seeing this Retraction so unjustly overlook'd  laboured to prove these two Points out of Scripture Civil Law Statute Law Common Law and Conscience in every of which he had been plentifully read as the same Auditor of his Arraignment goes on first that there ought to be produced against him two Witnesses secondly that his Accuser might be brought to accuse him Face to Face  Agreeable here to are  Ralegh  's own Words after he had urged the Statutes of  Edward  III  Edward  VI and Queen  Elizabeth  produced the Opinions of Judges in the Law and Precedents from their Writings besides Testimonies from the Old and New Testament where he says  If by the Statute Civil Law and God's Word it be requir'd that there must be two Witnesses at least hear with me if I desire but one  But truly it was an unreasonable Request those Statutes were repeal'd and the Law would not allow of it now tho' we are informed that King  James  himself taking Notice how  Cobham  was withheld should say  If he could have spoken any Thing against  Ralegh  they would have brought him from  Constantinople  to have accused him  Well  therefore might he desire the Jury to consider  There is no Cause so doubtful which the King's Counsel cannot make good against the Law These Men do usually defend bad Causes every Day against Men of their own Profession and as able as themselves if they can do so what may they not do with me who never studied Law till I came into the Tower of  London  who have been practis'd in other Affairs am weak of Memory and feeble as you see  for he was fain to have a Pen and Ink to help him in the long Speeches that were made against him Then said he more closely to them  If you would be content to be judg'd upon Suspicions and Inferences if you would not have your Accusation subscrib'd by your Accuser if you would not have your Accuser brought to your Face being in the same House too where you are arraign'd if you would be condemned by an Accusation of one that has recanted and is truly sorrowful for it if you in my Case would yield your Bodies to Torture lose your Lives your Wives and Children and all your Fortunes upon so slender a Proof then am I ready to suffer all these Things  or as the common Trial has it  If you would be contented to be so judged judge so of me  Now tho'  Ralegh  at last put himself on it that if  Cobham  would only speak before God and the King  that ever he knew either ef  Arabella  's Matter or the Money out of  Spain  or of the surprizing Treason or would accuse him with Things equivalent in any main Point or any Ways to have been an Instigator of him to deal with the King of  Spain yet would they not let  Cobham  confront him or give his Testimony  viva voce  and tho'  Ralegh  did not directly consent to be determined by  Cobham  's Accusation if they should now produce it justified under his Hand yet he was forced to submit to what they had in Reserve of this Kind which was the Letter above  mentioned written to the Lords at  Winchester  the Day before the Trial Some say this Letter was not written by  Cobham  himself but that Sir  William Wade  one of  Cecyll  's Creatures tampering with his Weakness got  Cobham  to write his Name to a Blank to which says my Author  Wade  no question wrote the Accusation Others imply that  Cobham  did himself write it tho' after he was instructed by a Letter from his Lady that there was no Way to save his own Life but to accuse  Ralegh  and that it was so reported upon the going together of the Jury This Letter was read with great Triumph and Exultation by  Coke  as follows  I have thought it fit to set down this to my Lords wherein I profess on my Soul to write nothing but the Truth I am come now near to the Period of my Time therefore I confess the Truth before God and his Angels  Ralegh  four Days before I came from the  Tower  caused an Apple to be thrown in at my Chamberwindow the Effect of it was to intreat me to right the Wrong I had done him in saying that I would come home by  Jersey  which under my Hand to him I have retracted His first Letter was thrown in the same Manner wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter which I did He sent me Word the Judges met at Mr  Attorney  's House and that there was good Hope the Proceedings against us should be staid he sent me another Time a little Tobacco At  Aremberg  's coming  Ralegh  dealt with me to procure him a Pension of fisteen hundred Pounds a Year▪ for which he promised that no Action should be against  Spain  but he would give Knowledge beforehand He told me the States had Audience with the King He hath been the original Cause of my Ruin for I had no Dealing with  Aremberg  but by his Instigation He hath been the Cause of my Discontentment he advised me not to be overtaken with Preachers as  Essex  was and that the King would better allow of a constant Denial than to accuse any  But this Advice to a Denial and by that Example and the Desire of any such Pension from  Spain Ralegh  protested to be false And further to shew them what a base dishonourable Recreant  Cobham  was he pull'd out the Letter which  Cobham  a few Days before wrote to him voluntarily in the  Tower  desiring the Lord  Cecyll  to read it because he knew his Hand and that the Jury would observe if  Cobham  's Testimony were of any Credit with them how much more solemnly it was writ to clear than the other to condemn him being in these Words  Seeing myself so near my End for the Discharge of my own Conscience and freeing myself from your Blood which else will cry Vengeance against me I protest  upon my Salvation I never practis'd with  Spain  by your Procurement God so comfort me in this my Affliction as you are a true Subject for any Thing that I know I will say with  Daniel  Purus sum à sanguine hujus  So God have Mercy on my Soul as I know no Treason by you  This was the last Evidence given yet the Jury brought in their Verdict guilty This Letter last produced to acquit  Ralegh  not prevailing with them so much it seems as the Letter before which was last tho' less forcibly written by  Cobham  to accuse him  which all Things considered says the Person who heard the whole Trial  was no more to be weigh'd than the Barking of a Dog and I would not  continues he  for much to have been of the Jury to have found him guilty  Some of his Jury we are further told were after he was cast so far touch'd in Conscience as to demand of him Pardon on their Knees and even  Coke  the Attorney himself being retired into a Garden to take some Air when his Man brought him Word that the Jury had condemn'd  Ralegh  of Treason  answered Surely thou art mistaken for I myself accused him but of Misprision of Treason and this Relation upon the Word of a Christian I have received says my Author from Sir  Edward Coke's  own Mouth  Sentence being given  Ralegh  humbly desired the King might know the Proofs against him that he still persisted in his Loyalty notwithstanding that Verdict which he would pray that his said Jury might never answer for and only craved Pardon for concealing Lord  Cobham  's Offer to him which he did through a Confidence that he had diverted him from those Humours So accompanied the Sheriff to the Prison  with admirable Erection yet in such Sort as a condemned Man should do  Thus was he  tired out of his Life as one observes by the Bawling of the King's Counsel on one Side and the Bench's insisting on a Confession extorted from the Lord  Cobham  out of Fear on the other rather than convinced  And thus did his Adversaries reap Dishonour and Reproach in their Victory while he received triumphant Applauses in his Overthrow like some Flowers which are sweeter in their Fall than others in their Bloom He stood at a Bay with them from Morning 'till Night  to the great Admiration of the Hearers who all thought that a Man of such Understanding and Experience would hardly be drawn into a Plot so soul and so foolish Divers who went thither his Enemies went away with Commiseration of his Injuries and Misfortunes thinking never Man spake better for himself  One of his Auditors says  He behaved himself so worthily so wisely so temperately that in half a Day the Mind of all the Company was changed from the extremest Fate to the extremest Pity  And another says That  Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Carriage was most remarkable first to the Lords humble yet not prostrate  Towards the Jury affable but not fawning rather shewing Love of Life than Fear of Death Towards the King's Counsel patient but not insensibly neglecting not yielding to Imputations laid against him in Words And it was wondered that a Man of his heroic Spirit could be so valiant in suffering that he was never overtaken in Passion  c On the other Side as to  Coke  's Behaviour we shall to what has been said only observe as one Means to account for it that it  Essex  was known to have ever been in any wise a Friend or Patron to him as it appears he was in a private Memorial of an honourable Person who was of the same College in  Oxford  with  Ralegh  and almost of the same standing then  Coke  might perhaps think of retrieving himself in the Eye of the World and making Atonement for his  Ingratitude  to the said Earl also at his Trial and to his Memory after his Death by his Inhumanity now to one of the contrary Faction  Cecyll  on the other Side play'd a smooth Edge upon  Ralegh  throughout the Trial his Blade seemed ever anointed with the Balsam of Compliment or Apology whereby he gave not such rough and smarting Wounds though they were as deep and fatal as the other But  Ralegh  could distinguish crooked Friendship and perhaps the Grounds of it in this Place as well as he has done crooked Wisdom in another when to those Speeches where  Cecyll  said  My Affection to you Sir  Walter Ralegh  was not extinguish'd but slaked in Regard of your Deserts and excepting your Faults I call them no worse by God I am your Friend  he answered  Whoever is the Workman it is Reason he should give Account of his Work to the Workmaster  As to any Impertinences that occurred in the Trial they appear no where so much as in the personal Reflections made by the said Attorney  Coke  and the Lord Chief Justice  Popham  whom  Camden  justly calls a censorious Man they being foreign to the Matters  Ralegh  was charged with therefore he wisely looked over them But these and the other Irregularities throughout the whole Proceedings which have left Men so unsatisfied in the Justice of them against Sir  Walter Ralegh  and so little inclined to believe him the Criminal his Enemies made him being summed up by an able Hand and one whose Province it more properly was to judge of them I shall take my Leave of the said Trial with a Reference to his Observations on it  Sir  John Hawles  Sollicitor General to the late King  William  in his Reply to a Sheet of Paper entitled The  Magistracy  and  Government  of  England vindicated  Printed in Fol having observed that the Accusations of Sir  Walter Ralegh  did not amount to a legal Proof says further p as follows "Not to mention all that might be excepted to in the Trial of the Case cited I would know by what Law is the Deposition of a Person who might be brought Face to Face to the Prisoner read as Evidence I would know by what Law it is forbidden that the Accuser should be brought Face to Face to the Accused I would know by what Law  Brook  's Deposition of what the Lord  Cobham  told him of  Ralegh  was Evidence against  Ralegh  I would know by what Law the Story  Dyer  told of what an unknown Man said to him at  Lisbon  of Don  Ralegh  was Evidence against  Ralegh  I would know by what Statute the Statutes of the th of  Edward  III and the th of  Edward  VI are repeal'd This Trial was so very irregular throughout that I would willingly believe it was not so as it is related but if it were so I am sure none can defend it And even for that Reason if any such Resolution was in the Case as is cited I am sure it ought to carry no Credit with it And there is no Reason to believe there was any such Resolution there being no Occasion for it the Question being only Fact which Sir  Walter  deny'd The Circumstances of his Trial in which the Court always overruled the Prisoner were somewhat like the Lord  Russel  's he complained of the ill Usage of the King's Counsel as well as the Lord  Russel  and both had Reason so to do Hearsay was admitted to be given in Evidence against both all that either of them said for themselves tho' very material was slighted The one was put in Mind at his Trial of the Death of the Earl of  Essex  as the other was of the Death of the Viscount  Stafford  both in their dying Speeches vindicated themselves of those Aspersions The principal Witnesses in both Cases had before the Trials asfirm'd they knew nothing against them They were both accused with having heard what other Persons had said in their Company and had not discover'd it they both gave the same Answer that they could not help other Men's talk I think it is plain at this Day that of Sir  Walter Ralegh  is thought a  Shamplot  What the Lord  Russel  's is thought let the author say"    That  Ralegh  expected nothing less than this Kind of Treatment from those Hands is plain by the Letter which he wrote to the King himself just before his Trial wherein having said  I know that among many Presumptions gathered against me your Majesty has been persuaded that I was one of those who were greatly discontented and therefore the more likely to prove disloyal but the great God of Heaven and Earth disclaim me from both Worlds if I were not the contrary and if I took not great Comfort to behold your Majesty always learning some Good and bettering my Knowledge by your Majesty's Discourse And having humbly beseeched him not to believe any of those who under Pretence of Offences to Kings do easily work their particular Revenge  he says a little further  For my Part I protest before the everliving God that I never intended Treason consented to Treason or performed Treason against you and yet I know I shall fall into their Hands  è quibus non possum evadere  unless by your Majesty's gracious Compassion I be sustained  Another Letter which he wrote to the Lords gives us some further Light or Assurance that the Offer made to him for one Intention and to others for another was construed as made to him for both where speaking of the two principal Accusations against him he says  the first was that Money was offered me  with a Pretence to maintain the Amity but the Intent was to have assisted his Majesty's Surprise The other that I was privy to my Lord  Cobham  's  Spanish  Journey For the first it seems this Money was offered to others long after it was offered to me and upon other Considerations than it was to me For myself I avow upon my Allegiance that I never knew or suspected either the Man or the new Intention To me it was but once propounded and in three Weeks after I never heard more of it neither did I belive that he had any Commission to offer it for it that Word Amity had been used to me Colourably I must have been also made acquainted with the true End for which it should have been given which it seems was for the Surprize But of any such horrible Purpose if ever I had so much as a Suspicion I refuse your Lordships Favour and the King's Mercy I know your Lordships have omitted nothing to find out the Truth but as you have not err'd like ill Surgeons to lay on Plaisters too narrow for so great Wounds so I trust that you will not imitate unlearned Physicians to give Medicines more cruel than the Disease itself For the Journey into  Spain  I know I was accused to be privy thereto but I know your Lordships have a Reputation of Conscience as well as Industry By what means that revengeful Accusation was stirr'd you my Lord  Cecyll  know right well that it was my Letter about  Keymis  and your Lordships all know whether it be maintain'd or whether out of Truth and out of a Christian Consideration it be revoked  A little further he says  As the King's Counsel in  Ralegh  's Trial used Arguments grounded on Presumptions to prove him Guilty so did he there also use others to clear himself grounded on these of his great Expences against the  Spaniards  and his having always been such a noted Enemy to their Faction But the Sum of  l  in this Letter above is only call'd so many Crowns in the said common Trial  God knows and I can give an Account of it  that I have spent    Pounds of my own against that King and Nation that I never reserved so much of all my Fortunes as to purchase forty Pounds  per Annum  Land that I have been a violent Prosecutor and Furtherer of all Enterprizes against that Nation I have served against them in Person and how my Lord Admiral and my Lord of  Suffolk  can witness I discover'd myself the richest Part of all his  Indies  I have planted in his Territories I offer'd his Majesty at my Uncle  Carew  's to carry two Thousand Men to invade him without the King's Charge Alas to what End should we live in the World if all the Endeavours of so many Testimonies should be blown off with one blast of Breath or be presented by one Man's Word Think therefore  says he a little further  I beseech you on my great Affliction with Compassion who lost my Estate and the King's Favour upon one Man's Word and as you would that God should deal with you deal with me  He concludes in this Manner  Your Lordships know that I am guiltless of the Surprize intended you know or may know that I never accepted of the Money and that it was not offered me for any ill and of the  Spanish  Journey I trust your Consciences are resolved Keep not then I beseech you these my Answers and humble Desires from my Soveraign Lord  qui est rex pius misericors non leo coronatus In another Letter which he wrote to the King after his Trial he has these Words  Lost I am for hearing a vain Man for hearing only and never believing or approving and so little Account I made of that Speech of his which was my Condemnation that I never remember'd  any such Thing till it was at my Trial obiected against me  This Letter he nobly concludes with a Desire only to  repay  a  lent Life  with a Love and Affection equal to the Goodness wherewith his Majesty should please to bestow it  If these Letters had any good Effect it appeared not immediately  Ralegh  being kept near a Month at  Winchester  after he was condemned in daily Expectation of Death We find that when the Report of the Arraignments was made to the King in his Privy▪chamber at  Wilton  he carried himself so reservedly that no Body could guess how well he was satisfied with the Equality of Condemnation till he made himself a Difference in the Punishment The two Priests were executed on the th of  November  and  George Brook  on the th of  December  following His Majesty also sign'd Warrants for  Cobham Grey  and  Markham  to be beheaded on the th Day of the said Month But in the particular  Narrative  of this proceeding to Execution  Ralegh  is not so much as mention'd and this might be owing to the extraordinary Disappointment of that Purgation which was expected from one of those three next to be executed for the Day aforesaid being come  Markham  was first brought to the Scaffold and having ended his Speech Prayers with all he had to say and being on his Knees ready to receive the Stroke of the Ax up steps  John Gibb  Groom of the King's Bedchamber to Sir  Benjamin Tichbourne  the Sheriff of  Hampshire  with his Majesty's Warrant to stay the Execution so  Markham  was told he must withdraw a while into the Hall to be confronted by the Lords Then Lord  Grey  was brought upon the Stage and he is said to have poured out his Prayers and his Confession tho' not one Word of them recorded in our Narrative  aforesaid then was he also call'd aside Lastly  Cobham  was brought and expos'd in the same Manner and his Devotions to God are mentioned but not a Word of the Treason his Guilt or Innocence or concerning any Promoter of his Disloyalty or Discontent So when he had done the Sheriff found it Time to unravel the Plot by proclaiming and magnifying his Majesty's Mercy as we have it in the same Author who yet cannot forbear comparing his own Relation to a Comedy  representing so many lively Figures of Justice and Mercy in a King of Terror and Penitence in Offenders and of so great Admiration and Applause in all others as appeared in this Action carried on only and wholly by his Majesty's own Direction  But whereas  Coke  had after his outrageous Manner charged  Ralegh  in the Trial frequently with being the chief Plotter and Traitor in all this Conspiracy we now see the King in his Warrant aforesaid contradicting him where he says to use his own Dialect that  the tuo Priestis and  George Brooke  vaire the principal Plotteris and Intisairs of all the rest to the embracing of the saidis treasonabill Machinations  And yet you find in the Trial again that  Brook  's Treason was distinct and to be kept secret from  Ralegh  because there  Brook  tells  Markham Take Heed how you make Lord  Cobham  acquainted for whatever he knows  Ralegh  the Witch will get it out of him  In short the whole Proceeding is so full of Inconsistences Slanders and other like odious Effects of a false and malicious Prosecution that we may well conclude with that Historian who says  the King had Ground enough to shew Mercy which some of the condemned Party obtained  But  Ralegh  it seems did last taste of it and for no other apparent Reason but because he was the  only one whom his Enemies still wanted Matter to exclude from it as may be gather'd from what  Cecyll  wrote to a Correspondent three Days after the King's Warrant of Suspense to the others before mentioned where among these wonderful Instances of his Majesty's Clemency we are told  He pretended to forbear Sir  Walter Ralegh  for the present till the Lord  Cobham  's Death had given some Light how far he would make good his Accusation  And tho' we hear not that he ever did make it good yet was the pretended Time of  Ralegh  's Execution so determined however we find not that he like the rest was ever brought to the Place that he wrote what he intended for his last Words to his Wife the Night before he expected to be put to Death in a very moving Letter full of the most generous Acknowledgments of the wisest most religious and affectionate Advice to her no less than of the most heroic and magnanimous Sentiments in Regard to himself and to that Suffering which ordinary Souls so naturally shrink at It is too long to recite in this Place besides has been often printed and may be easily met with in his Works The historical Passages in it acquaint us that his Lands were conveyed to his Son as is before mentioned that he intended his Wife the Profits of his Wineoffice half his Goods and all his Jewels except some one to his Son that  Baily  owed him two hundred or as other Editions have it Pounds and his Brother  Adrian Gilber  six hundred that he had also much Money owing him in  Jersey  besides the Arrearages of the Wines which would pay all his Debts Towards the Conclusion he intreats her  to get those Letters if it be possible which I writ said he to the Lords wherein I sued for my Life God is my Witness that it was for you and yours that  I desir'd Life But it is true that I disdain myself for begging it for know it dear Wife that your Son is the Son of a true Man and one who in his own Respect despises Death and all his mishapen and ugly Forms I cannot write much God knows how hardly I steal this Time while others sleep and it is also high Time that I should separate my Thoughts from the World Beg my dead Body which living was deny'd thee and either lay it at  Sherborne  if the Land continue or in  Exeter  Church by my Father and Mother I can say no more Time▪ and Death call me away  And as in the former Part of this Letter  he trusts that his Blood will quench their Malice who had thus cruelly murdered him  So in the Conclusion  he prays to God that he may forgive his Persecutors and Accusers  But after all this Usage  Cobham  never confirming his Accusation of Sir  Walter Ralegh  they both were with the rest of the Prisoners returned on the th of  December  to the Tower of  London  Those of whom the least Profit was to be made were either acquitted or did afterwards get their Liberty among whom was  Markham  who travell'd abroad but endured greater Distress in his State of Freedom than he had in his Restraint  James Wadsworth  in his  English Spanish  Pilgrim to p speaking of the State and Demeanor of the  English  Fugitives under the King of  Spain  's Dominions says "This Sir  Griffin Markham  at his first arrival in  Bruxels  being kept under by the Jesuits was driven to such an Exigency that he was constrained to pluck out the inlaid Silver of the Hilts of his Sword to buy Flour to make a Hastypudding for his Dinner but he afterwards says the same Author took the best way to raise his Fortunes having got into Favour with the Duke of  Nubu  ge  who gives him the surest Pension of all"  But  Grey  it seems died in the Tower and with  Cobham  it went nigh to fare still worse for he would have starved there being so closely fleec'd  as he was by the Courtbeggars of his great Estate had they not also laid thereby a Kind of a Fine upon his Majesty for his Offences the Crown being imposed upon to support him in his many Years Confinement as  Ralegh  himself has sufficiently discover'd † And here to dispatch what more remains of this Lord relating to our present History we may observe that some Years after their Confinement  Ralegh  is said to have himself procur'd a Reexamination of  Cobham  and to have been absolutely cleared by him  But the Practices which were used against him therein are represented so Foul and Wicked  * The Lord  Cecyll  who was created Earl of  Salisbury  in  and Lord Treasurer upon the Death of  Buckhurst  Earl of  Dorset  in did very much engross the Revenues of the Crown as  Ralegh  made appear to the King himself in an excellent Dialogue he dedicated to his Majesty where among the Particulars of  Cecyll  's neglecting an Increase of    to the King's Estate the conferring a  l  Fine upon  Devonshire  and his Mistress the engrossing to himself many goodly Manors and the Exchange of  Theobald  's for  Hatfield  which the greatest Subject or Favourite Queen  Elizabeth  had never durst have named to her he farther instances that 'It had been an honest Service to the King to have also added  l  Lands of the Lord  Cobham  's with his Woods and Goods worth  l  more For those Lands remaining with  George Brook  's Children but during their Lives had been the King's for ever in Effect but to wrest them from the King and draw the Inheritance upon himself the Treasurer persuaded his Majesty to relinquish his Interest for a petty Sum of Money and that there might be no Counterworking he sent  Brook  six thousand Pounds to make Friends whereof Lord  Hume  had two thousand Pounds back again  Buckhurst  and  Berwick  had the other four thousand Pounds and the Treasurer and his Heirs the Mass of Land for ever"  What then came to the King by this confiscation  says one of the Correspondents in the said Dialogue "His Majesty answers t'other by all those goodly Possessions Woods and Goods loses five hundred Pounds a Year which he gives in Pension to  Cobham  to maintain him in Prison" See Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  Prerogative of Parliaments  in his  Remains  last Edit p c  as to have given some whose Interest it was to favour the Administrations of these Times Occasion to suspect the Assertion tho' it is corroborated by several material Circumstances as well as the Testimony of coeval Writers The Author in whom we first meet with this Passage and whose shorter Account of it is before related to shew that  Ralegh  's Life was surreptitiously taken away gives it us again more Circumstantially and has a true Story thus  Queen  Anne  that brave Princess was in a desperate and some believed incurable Disease whereof the Physicians were at the furthest End of their Studies to find the Cause at a  non plus  for the Cure Sir  Walter Ralegh  being by his long Studies an admirable Chymist undertook and performed the Cure  The Author of  Aulicus Coquinariae  thinks he sufficiently answers this Passage where he says p  'The Queen was never cur'd of her Disease but by Death that ends all Maladies'  Now the Disease which this Queen  Anne  died of was a Dropsy but not till after Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Death and above fifteen Years after this his Imprisonment whereas the Disease from which  Ralegh  recover'd her was a Fever as Dr  Welwood  informs us in his Notes on  Wilson  's History of King  James  In the same Place he says it was some Time before the Illness of Prince  Henry  and  Camden  in his  Annals  of King  James  telling us when Sir  Julius Caesar  was made a Privycounsellor we may conclude this Cure was perform'd between the Years and  for which he would receive no other Reward but that her Majesty would procure that certain Lords might be sent to examine  Cobham  whether he had accused Sir  Walter Ralegh  of Treason at any Time under his Hand The King at the Queen's Request and in Justice could do no less sends some Lords and others of the Council which as our Author goes on were the Duke of  Lenox Salisbury Worcester Suffolk  Sir  George Carew  and Sir  Julius Caesar  to demand of  Cobham  whether he had not under his Hand accused Sir  Walter Ralegh  at  Winchester  upon that Treason he was arraign'd for  Cobham  did protest never nor could he but  said he  that Villain  Wade  did often sollicite me and not prevailing that Way got me by a Trick to write my Name upon a piece of white Paper which I thinking nothing did so that if any Charge came under my Hand it was forged by that Villain  Wade  by writing something above my Hand without my Consent or Knowledge  An Author has attempted to disprove this Particular thus  'How could  Wade  tamper with  Cobham  to write his Name to a Blank to which  Wade  framed the Accusation against  Ralegh  when it appears  Cobham  never signed at all to his Examinations'  Aulic Coquin  p But it is plain this Trick of  Wade  's if such he committed could not be meant of  Cobham  's Examinations for they were taken at  Richmond  and at  London  but the Question here put was Whether  Cobham  had not under his Hand accused Sir  Walter Ralegh  at  Winchester  which could relate only to this Letter of Accusation before quoted which was subscribed with  Cobham  's Name and pretended to be written by him the Night before  Ralegh  's Trial there  These six returning to the King the Rest made  Salisbury  their Spokesman who said Sir My Lord  Cobham  hath made good all that ever he wrote or said Where it is to be noted that this was but an Equivocating Trick in  Salisbury  for it was True that  Cobham  had made good whatever he had Writ but never wrote any Thing to accuse  Ralegh  by which you see the Baseness of this Lord the Credulity of the King and the Ruin of Sir  Walter Ralegh  As for the miserable End this Lord  Cobham  made the same Author relates it  He tells us that "as Lord  Grey  died pitied  Cobham  died scorn'd and his Death as base for he died lousy for Want of Apparel and Linnen and had starved had not a Trencherscraper some Time his Servant in Court relieved him with Scraps in whose House he died being so poor a House as he was forced to creep up a Ladder into a little Hole to his Chamber which was a strange Judgment and unprecedented for a Man of seven thousand Pounds  per Annum  and of a personal Estate of thirty thousand Pounds of all which the King was so cheated or of what should have escheated to him that he could not give him any Maintenance as in all Cases the King does unless out of his own Revenue of the Crown which was the Occasion of this Lord's Want his Wife being very rich and would not give him the Crumbs that fell from her Table and this was a just Judgment of God on him" Thus  Weldon  p c  Osborne  also much to the same Sense tells us from the Authority of  William  Earl of  Pembroke  that  Cobham  died in a Room ascended by a Ladder at a poor Woman's House in the  Minories  formerly his Laundress rather of Hunger than of any more natural Disease Thus miserable was his Fate in meeting with a Prince so inconsiderately profuse to Strangers that he forgot the Owner not leaving him wherewithal to buy Bread An Impiety not found among Infidels  who ever deemed it less Injustice to take away Life than the means to maintain it  and it is also confirm'd  by others who were well acquainted with the History of these Times and from whom we learn that  Cobham  survived not Sir  Walter Ralegh  above two or three Months  But to return to more early Passages in  Ralegh  's Imprisonment and to consider his State as it appears at his Entrance therein we may very easily believe he was at first in very great Trouble to be so suddenly and in such a Manner depriv'd of Power Fortune Liberty and Reputation but find nothing to confirm the extraordinary Dejection one Writer describes him under where he says  'In the publick Joy and Jubilee of the whole Realm when Favour Peace and Pardon were offered even to Offenders he who in Wit in Wealth in Courage was inferior to few fell suddenly he cannot tell how into such a downfall of Despair that his greatest Enemies would not have wished him so much Harm as he would have done himself'  for we have seen he had Enemies who would have done him the Injury that could not  be exceeded had not the King in some degree of Justice rather than Mercy to him interpos'd and secured him as well from being quite destroyed by as taking Revenge on them Besides that Letter to his Wife beforementioned when his Fate appeared nearest and most unavoidable to him demonstrates the Firmness and Fortitude of a Man who could receive Death as an Acquaintance rather than a Stranger or one who having so often gone to face him among the Foes to his Country abroad could with equal steadiness and composure of Mind meet him from those at Home Indeed the Affairs of a Person who had such various and extensive Dealings or Commerce with Mankind could not but be somewhat perplexed and embarrass'd upon a Fall so sudden and precipitous therefore to find him employing Agents for collecting in Debts and satisfying Creditors is to be expected Thus in one of his Letters to Sir  Michael Hext  he desires him to spare  John Shellbury  for a little Time he being bound for him in a Sum of fifteen hundred Pounds and if he was restrained so that he could not recover the Winearrearages which as we find from  Ralegh  's Letter before to his Wife would clear all his Debts they must remain unpaid The Date endors'd upon this Letter probably by Sir  Michael  himself is  November  In the Middle of  February  following we find a Grant made by the King to that  John Shellbury  and another Person to this Effect  'That Sir  Walter Ralegh  late of  Sherborne  c being attainted of High Treason whereby all his Goods and Chattels Real and Personal Moveable and Immoveable Debts Duties Sums of Money Bonds c are forfeited His Majesty therefore in Consideration that the said Debts which Sir  Walter Ralegh  did truly  owe before the said Attainder and Conviction may be justly and truly paid as also for the Help and Maintenance of Dame  Elizabeth  his Wife his Child and Family and for other Considerations grants to  John Shellbury  and  Robert Smith  of  London  Gentlemen all the said Goods c'  Thus we see a great Distinction made already between him and  Cobham  and shall find more Favour extending towards him in a little while 'Tis said to be much owing to the earnest and unwearied Intercessions of his Lady at Court who that she might be more serviceable to him soon after he was committed to the  Tower  petition'd the King that she might be a Prisoner with her Husband or live with him there in his Confinement and her Request was granted Here manifestly after the Grant aforesaid to  Ralegh  's Trustees because that mentions but one of his Sons she was delivered of the other and he was Christen'd  Carew  who was yet born as Authors compute within the Year abovementioned To this Satisfaction  Ralegh  had others afterwards which greatly alleviated the loss of his Liberty so that his restraint which was intended as a Mortification his Prudence in Time so converted that it proved only a Retirement or the quiet Enjoyment of a domestick Life and he felt certain Comforts arise from the constant Company of his little Family which in the Pomp of Courts the Pride of Conquests the Glory of Discoveries and the Sweetness of Freedom itself he had never tasted But this Tranquillity appears not to have suddenly arrived being for a while divested of all his Estate and having some Contentions at Law with those who were considerably indebted to him and could not otherwise be brought to Account  one Instance whereof we have in  William Sanderson  the elder  who was of Kin to Ralegh  For the said  William Sanderson  the Elder who was much engaged among the MerchantAdventurers in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign and one of her Commissioners for the  Spanish  PrizeGoods also of Note for the great Globes which by his Encouragement were brought to Perfection married about the Year  Margaret Snedale  or  Snowdale  the Daughter of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Sister  Mary  by her Husband  Hugh Snedale  a Commander in the Queen's royal Navy  and as we are told in the Time of his Prosperity and Greatness was his Servant intrusted with receiving great Sums of Money for him out of his Office of Wines and his other Places by which he became in Arrear to  Ralegh  in divers great Sums which after his Troubles he sent for to  Sanderson  who was so far from paying them that he pretended  Ralegh  should owe him    Pounds Whereupon Sir  Walter  in great Anger commenced a Suit against  Sanderson  which was managed by his Servant and Sollicitor  John Shellbury  and  Sanderson  being overthrown and found in Arrear to  Ralegh  in very great Sums was cast into Prison where he died a Beggar Hence sprung all the Spleen and Malice of  William Sanderson  the younger in his History of King  James  's Reign towards Sir  Walter Ralegh Now this Exposure both of that Author's Father and his own History so enraged the Son that he forthwith published an Answer to the said Pamphlet in which he not only endeavours to support what he had written of Sir  Walter Ralegh  in his History though with no Authorities or satisfactory Reasons but falls most foully upon  Carew Ralegh  as if he was the Author of the Pamphlet aforesaid against his History and that with such womanish Spleen and Slander as might have betrayed had not himself owned that his Wife had a Hand in writing it But of the Passage here  last quoted tho' he contradicts several Particulars he does not deny the main Point which is that Sir  Walter Ralegh  now after his Reprieve did commence Suits by  Shellbury  against his Father which might naturally sharpen the Son's Pen and warp his Impartiality when he was representing him in his History and the rather if  Ralegh  was such a Debtor besides to his Father as he describes him But whoever was the Author of those Observations on the said History he has not more unfavourably treated it than others who examined it  Dr  Welwood▪  in his Notes on  Wilson  's History of King  James  says nothing could inhance the Value of it more than "a most wretched one published by one  William Sanderson  who pretends in several Places to some secret Memoirs or Discourses with great Men to make good the Passages of his History But the Truth is the whole is nothing else but an illcompil'd Collection out of other Authors wherein he for the most Part mistakes or perverts their Meaning In cursorily reading over this History I have sometimes taken Notice of above four or five gross Errors either in Names Things or Chronology in one single Page"  When  Ralegh  had got over these troublesome Contests all Things appear'd for a while about him as serene as in such a gloomy State could be hoped for and he who lately was upon the very Brink of Dissolution had all his Offices Lands and Goods seized upon and was himself committed a close Prisoner had not only his Life repriev'd and his Confinement sweetned with some Degrees of Latitude but even his Estate also restor'd to him For these Lands were actually made over by Sir  Walter Ralegh  to his Son both Inheritance and Fee before Queen  Elizabeth  died as formerly was also the Lease for Years So that as he observes again in another Place  being entail'd on Sir  Walter  's Heirs he could not forfeit them but during his  own Life and the King finding in himself the Iniquity of Sir  Walter  's Condemnation gave him all what he had forfeited again  Herewith agrees likewise Sir  John Harrington  who not only tells us by whose Mediation  Ralegh  recovered his said Estate and his Enlargement in Prison but how laudably he employed himself there at the Time of this Author's Writing which might be about the Year where he says  God put it into the King's Mind against Man's Expectation to save his Life and since by the Suit of his faithful Wife both to preserve his Estate and to ease his Restraint in such Sort as many who are at Liberty taste not greater Comforts than he doth in Prison being not barr'd of those Companions meaning Books that he may and perhaps does take more true Comfort in them than ever he took of his courtly Companions in his chiefest Bravery  But this Prospect was soon overcast for there was a young  Scotchman  named  Robert Car  who soon after the said Restitution sprang up in great Favour at Court and having no Fortune of his own it was contrived by those who had gaped in vain for  Ralegh  's Estate themselves to lay the Foundation of this Favourite's future Greatness upon his Ruin for being thus frustrated of the Effects of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Attainder they pretended to find a Flaw in his last Conveyance of the Fee and Inheritance of  Sherborne  to his Son and to this purpose an Information was exhibited in the  Exchequer  by the Attorneygeneral  Hobart  to which  Ralegh  put in his Answer and therein the said Grant or Conveyance was set forth to be made over as above yet for Want of a single Word which was found notwithstanding in the Paperbook and was only the Oversight of the Clerk they pronounced the Conveyance invalid and  Sherborne  absolutely forfeited to the Crown a Judgment to be foreseen without Witchcraft since his chief Judge was his greatest Enemy and the Case argued between a friendless Prisoner and the King of  England  Then was  Sherborne  given to this  Car  afterwards Earl of  Somerset  The Lady  Ralegh  and her Children earnestly petitioned the King for Compassion but could now obtain no other Answer than  he  mun  have the Land he  mun  have it for  Car And she a Woman of high Spirit on her Knees pray'd to God that he would punish those who had thus wrongfully exposed her and her Children to Ruin We have an elegant Letter of  Ralegh  's extant to  Car  himself upon this Occasion but having been corruptly printed it may appear from several antient Manuscriptcopies more correct as follows  'After some great Losses and many Years Sorrows of both which I have Cause to fear I was mistaken in the End it is come to my Knowledge that yourself whom I know not but by an honourable Fame has been persuaded to give me and mine our last fatal Blow by obtaining from his Majesty the Inheritance of my Children and Nephews lost in the Law for want of a Word This done there remains nothing with me but the Name of Life despoiled of all else but the Title and Sorrow thereof His Majesty whom I never offended for I ever held it unnatural and unmanly to hate Goodness stayed me at the Grave's brink not as I hope that he thought me worthy of many Deaths and to behold all mine cast out of the World with myself but as a King who judging the Poor in Truth has received a Promise from God  that his Throne shall be established for ever  And for yourself Sir seeing your fair Day is but now  in the Dawn and mine drawn to the Evening your own Virtues and the King's Grace assuring you of many Favours and much Honour I beseech you not to begin your first Building upon the Ruins of the Innocent and that their Sorrows with mine may not attend your first Plantation I have been ever bound to your Nation as well for many other Graces as for their true Report of my Trial to his Majesty against whom had I been found Malignant the hearing of my Cause would not have changed Enemies into Feiends Malice into Compassion and the Minds of the greatest Number present into the Commiseration of my State It is not the Nature of foul Treason to beget such fair Passions neither could it agree with the Duty and Love of faithful Subjects especially of your Nation to bewail his Overthrow who had conspir'd against their most liberal and natural Lord I therefore trust Sir that you will not be the first that shall kill us outright cut down the Tree with the Fruit and undergo their Curse who enter the Field of the Fatherless which if it please you to know the Truth is far less fruitful in Value than in Fame But that so worthy a Gentleman as yourself will rather bind us to your Service being Sir Gentlemen not base in Birth or Alliance who have Interest therein and myself with my utmost thankfulness will ever remain ready to obey your Commandments'  This Letter in one or two old Copies is dated  December  But this so little prevailed upon  Car  or any other Applications  Ralegh  might make to the King with his Majesty himself that besides  Sherborne  and the Manors belonging to it those other Lands which  Ralegh  himself had purchased call'd  Pinford  and  Primesly Barton  and the Manors appertaining also thereunto forfeited with the rest by his Attainder were  also granted the following Year or the seventh of his Majesty's Reign to the said Favourite  But now or not long after  Ralegh  was grown into high Esteem with that great hope and heir of these Kingdoms Prince  Henry Frederick  the King's eldest Son who being satisfied of his Loyalty and well inform'd of his great Qualifications and Experience in Civil and Military Affairs with his hazardous Services for the Honour and Defence of his Country no less than his many publickspirited Adventures both to enlarge and enrich it testified not his own Merits more in any one particular than in distinguishing those of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and notwithstanding the many little envious Detractions of some undermining Courtiers about him did both encourage his Epistolary Addresses to him from the  Tower  and send for his Counsel or Opinion upon several emergent Occasions It was perhaps one of the brightest Rays in the shining Orb of this rare Prince's Actions that he never left invading the King with the most persuasive Solicitations that he would bestow  Sherborne  upon him with full design to return it to its just Owner till his Majesty at last granted his Request but by what cruel Fate  Ralegh  's hopes were eclipsed again and indeed those of the whole Kingdom we shall suddenly hear  In the mean Time we must hear endeavour to give such Light of that intercourse which passed between the said Prince  Henry  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  as those Letters and Discourses which he addressed to his Highness and are extant will afford and first when he found how commendably the Prince was inclined to the Studies of Navigation how much delighted he was with a View of the Fleet at  Chatham  how inquisitive or de  ous to inform himself by Consultation with the  most experienced Commanders in the Knowledge of building Ships most Artfully fitting them out most Commodiously sailing them most Dexterously and fighting with them most Successfully in order to execute those great Designs he had upon the  WestIndies  and  Spain  itself whenever the King thereof should give cause of publick Hostility as of his own Servants acquaints us and would have done more distinctly had he not been manacled in in a Courtly Maxim so discrepant with all personal Narrative  That to publish particulars agrees not with Rules of State Ralegh  composed and communicated to his Highness several Tractates upon these Subjects Such was his Letter touching the Model of a Ship which the Prince intended to build and such his Discourse of a Maritimal Voyage with the Passages and Incidents therein which he seconded with some necessary Observations on the Royal Navy and Sea Service also dedicated to his Highness and wherein he appears to have been a most worthy and earnest Counsellor of the Prince to a due Regard and Regulation thereof For says  Ralegh  to him in answer to any Objection that might be made to the Maintenance of so great a Fleet in the Perfection and Readiness which he recommends now in Times of Peace  'Tho' the Sword is put into the Sheath we must not suffer it to rust or stick so fast that we shall not be able to draw it readily when needs requires'  and a little further  'we may be assured that if those powerful Means whereby we reduced our Enemies to the Courtesy of seeking Peace of us were neglected so as we could not again upon Occasion readily assume the Use and Benefit of them as we have done those proud mastering Spirits finding us at such Advantage would be more willing to shake us by the Ears as Enemies  than to take us by the Hands as Friends Therefore far be it from our Hearts to trust more to that Friendship of Strangers which is but dissembled upon Policy and Necessity than to the Strength of our own Forces which has been experienced with so happy Success I confess that Peace is a Blessing of God and blessed are the PeaceMakers therefore doubtless blessed are those Means whereby Peace is gain'd and maintain'd For well we know that God works all Things here among us mediately and by a secondary Means the which Means of our Defence and Safety being Shipping and Seaforces are to be esteemed as his Gifts and then only available and beneficial when he withal vouchsafes his Grace to use them aright'  To this end  Ralegh  also wrote another Discourse for the said Prince  Of the Art of War by Sea  But the untimely Death of his Highness as we shall too soon find deprived both him and Posterity of the Advantages which a Subject so useful and uncommon from an Author so able and experienc'd did promise  There is nothing in these Discourses▪ or any other I have met with which shew  Ralegh  any ways concerned in writing those Propositions or Arguments for Foreign Wars which were delivered to Prince  Henry  by some of his Military Servants and which were afterwards abstractedly published together with an Answer at large written very conformable to the Taste of King  James  by the Learned Sir  Robert Cotton  tho' to the first Edition of this Treatise the Bookseller having prefixed Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Picture have thereby misled some Writers of his Life carelesly to insert this Book into the Catalogue of his Writings 'Tis true  Ralegh  has obliquely and subordinately  touched this Branch of the Subject in some of his Discourses upon War but in other Arguments than are here answered nay after this Answer was written nor are they addressed to the Prince but indeed written also after his Death In some Places he has given the greatest Discouragements to a military Life from knowing how many are deluded to be the Executioners of other Men's Ambition and to lay down their Lives for what they should not venture them  His Words are 'It may be affirmed the Number of those that have been slaughtered by their Fellowcreatures exceed the Number of all the Inhabitants that ever were at one Time living upon the Face of the Earth yet very few of this infinite Number thus untimely Slain were ever Masters of the Grounds of the Disputes for which they suffered or the true Reason of their being led to the Battle the Truth with much Artifice being kept from all but what were Parties to the Design resolved on What deluded Wretches then have a great part of Mankind been who have either yielded themselves to be slain in Causes which if truly known their Hearts would abhor or been the bloody Executioners of other Men's Ambition It is a hard Fate to be slain for what a Man should never willingly Fight yet few Soldiers have laid themselves down in the Bed of Honour under better Circumstances'  Ralegh  's Three Discourses p  yet withal the greater Disproportion of Honour and Reward which attends that Profession than others of less personal Hardship and Danger as was before partly observed In other Places he has written against wanton and causeless Invasions for the mere Sake of brutish and vainglorious Victory against waging War with our Enemies 'till we beat the Art of it into them 'till Cowards are learnt to be couragious and Defenders become Assailants Yet has elsewhere in a very ingenious Similitude shewn that martial Policy is one of the principal Supports of  Government  It is as follows 'They say that the goodliest Cedars which grow on the high Mountains of  Libanus  thrust their Roots between the Clifts of hard Rocks the better to bear themselves against the strong Storms that blow there As Nature has instructed those Kings of Trees so has Reason taught the Kings of Men to root themselves in the hardy Hearts of their faithful Subjects And as those Kings of Trees have large Tops so have the Kings of Men large Crowns whereof as the first would soon be broken from their Bodies were they not underborne by many Branches so would the other easily  otter were they not fasten'd on their Heads with the strong Chains of Civil Justice and Martial Discipline'  Ralegh  's  Rémain▪  last Edit p  However when a Prince has thereby got Authority or the sharpest Means in his Power he would have the mildest Use and the one acquired in full Strength only that the other may be exercised with perfect Safety For he ever preferred Reason and Love as stronger Chains of Government than Constraint or Violence and thought that royal Dealings was ever surest of meeting with royal Success Such were the Principles Sir  Walter Ralegh  infus'd not only into the Prince of  Wales  but all other Readers throughout his Writings and agreeable hereto is the Tenor of that Letter he wrote to the said Prince  August  the th concerning the most eligible Power in an  English  Sovereign where he has with the Spirit of a true Patriot said  Let me not doubt but all Plans which do not carry in them the mutual Happiness of Prince and People will appear as absurd to your great Understanding as disagreeable to your noble Nature  But now  Ralegh  's Pen was engaged upon a different Subject in the Prince's Service and by his Command for  'the first Overtures of a Marriage between this Prince and the eldest Daughter of  Spain  being put off'  the like Motion  was now made by the  Savoyan  Ambassador not only for a Marriage between Prince  Henry  and a Daughter of the Duke of  Savoy  but for another of his Son Don  Phillibert  Prince of  Piedmont  with Princess  Elizabeth  the Daughter of  England Ralegh  wrote two Discourses upon this Occasion in the Year last mentioned and that he particularly was requested by the Prince to give his Opinion of the said Offers appears in his Introduction to the first of those Discourses inscribed to some Minister of State about his Highness in which  Ralegh  has so notably discovered what a Tool for  Avarice and Ambition most of the Catholic Princes in  Europe  had made of this Sacrament of Matrimony  and how notoriously  the  Castilians  with those of whom these Princes are descended have gotten no less by the Traffick of their Marriages than they have done by the Trade of their  Indies that I wonder these excellent political Discourses were never made publick for the more easy Advertisement of our succeeding Princes upon this Topick The second of them upon the Match for Prince  Henry  is treated under eight Heads and in the fourth Page of it  Ralegh  has these Words  There is a Kind of noble and royal deceiving in Marriages between great Kings and Princes yea it is of all others the fairest and most unsuspected Kind of betraying It has been as ordinary among them to adventure or cast away a Daughter to bring some Purpose to pass as at other Times for saving of Charges to make them Nuns  A little farther having represented the Duke of  Savoy  so tied to the See of  Rome  both by Religion and Benefit that he could no more be separated and subsist than if his Soul was divided from his Body he goes on thus more directly concerning the Marriages  What then remains of Profit to our Prince by this Alliance A Sum of Money and a  beautiful Lady For Beauty says he it was never more cheap in any Age and it is ever better loved in the Hope than when it is had For the Million of Crowns offered which makes but two of our Subsidies I speak it confidently that when those Dukes Lords and great Ladies who will attend the Princess in her Passage hither shall be all presented with Gifts according to their Degrees and the King's Honour when the Preparations Triumphs and Feastings are paid for there will nothing remain but a great Encrease of Charge and perchance a great deal of Melancholly  And a little further  Ralegh  comes closer still to the Prince himself in these Words  Now if by these Dislikes of the former Alliances you make Judgment that it is my Desire that the Prince should not marry at all I say my Desire is not that the Prince should not marry at all but not as yet and I am exceeding Sorry that the Prince has not the same Desire For seeing his Majesty is yet but young and by God's Favour like to live many Years and that his Highness if he should now marry may have many Children born to him before he be    Years old and seeing all his Children shall be Princes and must be provided for as Princes I think it will much perplex him to find himself so environed 'till his Majesty has somewhat repaired his Estate and provided beautiful Gardens to plant these Olive Branches in While the Prince is unmarried all the Eyes of  Christendom  are upon him for with what King soever he shall be ballanced he will cast the Scale but to have him weighed with a little Prince I should be sorry and he himself will be as sorry after All the Princes in  Christendom  woo'd  Charles  Duke of  Burgundy  while his Daughter was unmarried and while our Prince is free our Enemies not knowing upon what Ground to build their Practices his Majesty's Safety is in the mean while  infinitely assured but the Prince once disposed of they will presently muster our Forces measure our Fortunes sound us to the Bottom and make their Approaches accordingly they will then say we have seen the utmost of the Prince of  Wales Then having observed that  since there is none but a Catholic Lady for us let us have a King on our Side says he to boot  So in Consideration of the many Motives to Enmity between  France  and  Spain  which he enumerates as also the many Obligations which  France  then lay under of Gratitude to the Crown of  England  and the Advantage of retaining the  Netherlands  he proposes the Daughter of the  French  King On the other Side that it would be a needless Hazard both to neglect this Love and Union and sustain withal the Hatred of the Archduke the Pope and the King of  Spain  together however disunited they were not to be feared  For then if they should combine against us from whom should we hope for Help If it be from  Savoy  or  Florence  God help us Our Friends inhabit beyond the Mountains our Enemies at Hand We leave those that are strongest and nearest us for those who are weakest and furthest off We leave those that can help us or harm us for those that can do neither Those we leave who depend on themselves to wit the  French  for those who depend on others to wit the  Savoyans  and  Florentines Thus ends Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Discourse upon the Marriage proposed for Prince  Henry  In his other Discourse on the Match that was offered for the ingenious and accomplished Lady  Elizabeth  that Prince's Sister having copiously exemplified as we have observed what mercenary Sacrifices had been made by crowned Heads of their Children in this grand Market of Matrimony and answered the Objection he foresaw some espaniolized Courtiers might make that seeing the  Kings of  France  and especially of  Spain  had so often matched themselves with the Dukes of  Savoy  Why should not the King of  England  also accept of their Alliance He proceeds to examine what Encrease of Honour and Dignity or what great Comfort or Contentment this excellent young Princess could expect or hope for by this Match  For the first to wit Honour and Dignity says he as she is born the eldest and now only Daughter of one of the mightiest Kings of  Christendom  so is she thereby of higher Place and State than the Wife of a Duke of  Savoy  Besides in her Birth and Blood both of Father and Mother descended of such royal Races as  Savoy  cannot add any greater Grace or Glory to and by Nature and Education endowed with such princely Perfections both of Body and Mind as may well deserve to be reputed a worthy Spouse for the greatest Monarch of  Christendom  especially considering the Possibilities of a Daughter of  England  whereof we have had many Precedents and  at this Time is happily manifested in the King's Majesty our Sovereign being descended of a Daughter of  England whereby the whole Island formerly divided is again now made one  GREATBRITAIN  to the mutual Strength of either Now to confer the Possibility of such a Fortune upon a poor popish Duke of  Savoy  that can return no Recompence of Benefit to this State were greatly for his Glory tho' little for the Advancement of this noble Princess and less for the Safety of this Kingdom considering the Dangers that it may draw upon our worthy magnanimous Prince and the noble Duke of  York  if the Ambition of this Match should tickle the  Savoyan  to look after Possibilities wherein there would want neither Means Persuasions nor Pardons from  Rome  to practise any Villainy in that Behalf whereby to benefit or strengthen an Appendix of  Spain  and so  devoted a Son to the  Romish  See For the  second  namely the Comfort and Contentment of this worthy young Lady by this Match as there is little in Appearance presently so there is less to be hoped for in the future For as first she must be removed far from her nearest Blood both by Father and Mother into a Country far estranged from our Nation as any part of  Christendom  and as far differing from us in Religion as in Climate And what true Correspondence or matrimonial Affection there can be maintain'd between those Persons whose Minds are different and opposite in the religious Points of their Christian Faith is greatly to be doubted Moreover it is greatly to be feared with what Safety and Security she can long live free from secret Practices and Treacheries in a Country so near the Pope's Jurisdiction environ'd with the Plots of the Jesuits who we see do daily traffick the Lives and Fortunes of all Princes who are not wholly devoted to the  Romish  Obedience and therefore how they will entertain or tolerate the Race of our King were too great an Error and Presumption to trust to So as when the worthy Lady hereafter by her Children or otherwise has furnish'd their Desire and fully served their Turn she shall be then either forced to wound her Conscience by forsaking her Faith or else to undergo the Scorns and Danger which shall be daily cast upon her and her Family for the Exercise of her Religion And this also we may be well assured of that if she shall have any Issue by the Prince of  Piedmont  they must all be bred and brought up contrary to her Conscience which can be no small Grief to a virtuous and natural Mother and as little Comfort to our just religious King their Grandfather Lastly the very binding Cause of Amity between all Kings Princes and States is their Trade and Intercourse of their Subjects Now  there is not any Prince or State of  Europe  the inland Countries of  Hungary  and  Transylvania  excepted but the  English  have Trade withal yea even with the  Turk Barbarian Persian  and  Indians  only with the Subjects of  Savoy  I do not know that we have any meddling or interchange at at all for the Duke has no Port his Ditch of  Villa Franca  excepted which is only capable of a few Gallies either to furnish Ships from or to receive them being Strangers And therefore for his Majesty of  England  to match his eldest and only Daughter with a Prince who has his Dependance on other Kings a Prince jesuited who can neither head us in Time of War nor trade with us in Time of Peace a Prince by the Situation of his Country every Way unprofitable to us and that no less perilous for his Majesty's Daughter to live in I resolve myself that he is of too excellent a Judgment ever to accept of it and his honourable Council too wise and provident to advise the Prosecution thereof Now if his  Highness  should be pleased to ask my Opinion with what  Christian  Prince he should match his Sister were it in his own Power and Choice to make Election I humbly desire to be excused herein for would it become me to presume so far It is true I have heard it that some Overtures have been made for the Prince  Palatine  of the  Rhine  certainly he is as well born as the Duke of  Savoy  and as free a Prince as he is The Nation is faithful he is of our Religion and by him we shall greatly fasten unto us the  Netherlands  And for the little Judgment which God has given me  I do prize the Alliance of the  Palatine  of the RHINE and of the  House  of NASSAU more than I do the Alliance of  T  n Dukes  of  Savoy  And thus ends his  Discourse  on the Marriage of Princess  Elizabeth  What followed was that about a Twelvemonth after the writing of those Discourses the said Princess was married to  Frederick  Elector Palatine of the  Rhine  This Marriage was celebrated on the th of  February  in such Pomp and Splendor that the Jewels only which were worn by the King Queen and Prince were valued that Day by his Majesty himself upon Occasion of Discourse happening of the Bravery then appearing at  l  Sterling Sir  John Finet  's Observations touching Foreign Ambassadors vo p  afterwards King of  Bohemia  a Match which might have well answered all the Advantages expected from it at least one that had never been attended with such a Series of Calamities were King  James  to have been moved if not through Honour and Power as a Sovereign yet through Nature and Affection as a Father to have granted them a seasonable Supply against their Enemies Instead of which his indulging beyond all Apprehension of Possibility at least all Production of precedent a blessed peaceable Temper as his Flatterers called it to the sitting down a quiet Spectator of his Childrens Overthrow and their Fortunes occasioned not only all the lamentable Wars which succeeded throughout  Germany  to the utter Ruin of his said Soninlaw and all the Princes who assisted him but also those of his Successor at Home throughout his own Dominions For daring not to draw his Sword through Fear of offending the  Spaniard  he sat musing at Home one while how to raise Money by PrivySeals Benevolences Crownlands and Woods either to cram his insatiable Favourites or else to fit out more prodigal and frivolous Embassies than would by Arms have settled his Children unmoveably in their Throne and at other Times how to improve  his Sovereignty or pick Quarrels with his Parliaments and entail them to his Heirsgeneral  As for the Prince of  Wales  he is said to have first encouraged the Prince Elector to attempt his Sister desiring more to head an Army in  Germany  than he durst make shew of and would no doubt have been bravely followed But alas that Fate which so often suffers the unworthy to flourish deprived this Kingdom of Prince  Henry  in less than a Month after the Arrival of the said  Elector  Some have insinuated as if the  Spaniards  because his Highness approved  Ralegh  's Discourse touching a War with  Spain  had a Hand in his untimely End alledging that if  Philip  the second cut off his own hopeful Son  Charles  for but pitying the People of  Flanders  it can be no wonder he or his Son should promote the Destruction of a Stranger who did so far applaud the Advice of  Ralegh  as to say  No King but his Father would keep such a Bird in a Cage  But from more intestine and unnatural Sources his sudden Death is surmised by others to have sprung the Disease being so violent that the Combat of Nature against it in the Strength of Youth he being almost Years of Age lasted but few Days Here it is somewhat remarkable that after Sir  Theodore Mayerne  with Dr  Butler Hamond  and other most eminent Physicians had used the utmost of their Skill in vain and had the least Hopes imaginable left of the Prince's Recovery that these should be at last centered in some Relief that might be had from Sir  Walter Ralegh  and that a Cordial from him a StatePrisoner should be sent for and with Consent or Approbation administered when all other Means had failed and were given over as we may gather from Sir  William Cornwallis  and other Historians of those Times As to the Effect  though it came too late so that it might rather prolong Pain than Life for a few Hours and truly must have been a Kind of Miracle to have restored one so far exhausted and on the Point of expiring for he died the same Evening being the th of  November  Yet to observant Readers it is enough to manifest first what high Reputation Sir  Walter Ralegh  's medicinal Knowledge through this Cordial had now gained and it afterwards encreased  Insomuch that there has been a distinct Volume written upon this Cordial whereby I find it is not to be taken for that which is called Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  Cordial  in a Book entitled as I remember  The Lady  's  Closet open'd  for that is only a simple StrawberryWater But this here meant was his Great Cordial as I find  Ralegh  in one of his Manuscripts has styl'd it himself This Cordial rose into such high Repute for its sovereign Virtues in the Reign of King  Charles  II and was so much recommended to and admired by him that he commanded  Nicholas e Febvre  the Royal Professor in Chymistry and Apothecary in Ordinary to his Majesty's Houshold to prepare a Quantity of this precious Remedy after the exactest Manner which the said Chymist not only did but composed in  French  also under his Majesty's Auspices and Command a Treatise entitled  Discours sur le Grand Cordial de Sir  Walter Ralegh which he dedicated to the said King And this was at the same time Translated into  English  by  Peter B  lon  Student in Chymistry For there were both Licensed on the d of  April  tho' the Translation appears to have been Printed first because it is dated that Year and the Original the Year after The  French  is in    the  English  in vo After the Dedication follows this Introduction of the

aforesaid begins his Discourse with Examples among the Antients of those who have made themselves Famous by their Remedies as  Mithridates  c and among the Moderns  Matheolus B Valentine Paracelsus  and others but finds none more worthy in this particular than Sir  Walter Ralegh  because he has not only selected most judiciously whatever is most Choice and Soveraign in the Animal Vegetable and Mineral World but has also manifested so much Art and Experience in the Preparation of this Great and Admirable Cordial as will of itself render him Immortal Wherefore he says he could not restrain the Applauses owing to his Honour and Glory which he has more than merited by that noble Labour and profound Study that acquired him the sublime Knowledge he had in the Virtues and Qualities of all those Ingredients which unite to the Composition of this incomparable Remedy So he proceeds to explain first the Virtues of every individual Drug which together cause those rare Effects this Cordial daily produces says he as well towards the Healthful as the Sick Secondly He specifies how Art helps Nature in the harmonious and exquisite Method of the Preparation Thirdly Distinguishes the Efficacy of it in Maritime or Islandic and Northerly Countries Lastly What a Preservative it is as well as Restorative and concludes with the Exposition of the Dose the Quantity Time and Method of using it Thus much concerning this Discourse on Sir  Walter Ralegh  's great Cordial of which the following Particulars may be here farther observed That the Author  le Febvre  acknowledging he had inserted two Ingredients by the Counsel and Approbation of the abovesaid Sir  Kenelm Digby  and Sir  Alexander Fraiser  which were not mentioned in the first Prescription and which I have marked before in a different Character being the Flesh H  a  t and Liver of Vipers and the mineral Unicorn which some would have to be the white Loadstone it may induce the Curious to enquire whether more Liberties have not been taken with Sir  Walter Ralegh  's own genuine Recipe To this end should be consulted the  English  Copy thereof in Sir  Kenelm Digby  's Collection of Receipts▪ printed a few Years after  le Febvre  's Book Also Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Book of Chymical Receipts an original MS in Sir  Hans Sloane  's Library marked B In which Book all written with  Ralegh  's own Hand there are p b these Words  Our Great Cordial  and underneath several Ingredients set down tho' not near the Number above cited but scored out again with a Pen tho' not  llegibly The next Leaf is torn out where 'tis supposed  Ralegh  had writ it more compleatly and that from this Leaf  le Febvre  's Copy was taken Lastly There is a Receipt of this Cordial remaining with a Lady who is a Descendant from Sir  Walter Ralegh  but whether agreeing with those in Print I have not at this juncture the Leisure for making a Request to be satisfied  among the most skilful of the Faculty  and secondly the unsteady and incoherent Opinions which were entertain'd of one and the same Man's Loyalty that he who was accused at his Trial of a Plot to  extirpate  the  Royal Family  should yet be so far relied on to save it as to have the Lives first of Queen  Anne  as was before related  and now of Prince  Henry  trusted to his Experiments But in a modern Author we have some further Circumstances of this Passage which I have not elsewhere met with For having spoken of the particular Esteem which Prince  Henry  had contracted for Sir  Walter Ralegh  the constant Correspondence he kept with him by Letters and Messages and of the Sollicitations he had so repeatedly made to the King for his Liberty as what might contribute towards his Majesty's personal Prejudice against  Ralegh  he adds  When the Prince fell into his last Illness the Queen sent to Sir  Walter Ralegh  for some of his  Cordial  which she herself had taken in a Fever some Time before with remarkable Success  Ralegh  sent it together with a Letter to the Queen wherein he express'd a tender Concern for the Prince and boasting of his Medicine stumbled unluckily upon an Expression to this Purpose  That it would certainly cure him or any other of a  Fever  except in Case of  Poison The Prince dying tho' he took it the Queen in the Agony of her Grief shewed  Ralegh  's Letter and laid so much Weight on the Expression about Poison that to her dying Day she could never be dissuaded from the Opinion that her beloved Son had foul Play done him  If this was true there might be a Stress too confidently laid on this Medicine in supposing that nothing but Poison could relesist the Power of it and perhaps some Inadvertency in starting such a Suspicion in a fond Mother which in the said modern Writer's Opinion there might possibly be no Ground for and might in the Consequence prove fatal to  Ralegh  himself tho' the same Author also knew  Ralegh  was not the only Man who started that Suspicion for he knew what the Prince's domestick Chaplain preach'd at St  James  's on the Dissolution of his Highness's Family and he knew  what the Lord Chief Justice  Coke  not long after said in open Court about the poisoning of Sir  Thomas Overbury  That it was to prevent the Discovery of another Crime of the same Nature committed upon one of the highest Rank whom he termed a  Sweet Prince  and indeed several Histories of these Times make no Secret of it where they shew the Bickerings between Prince  Henry  and the aforesaid Favourite  Car  in Regard to the Countess of  Essex  not to mention other Motives However the Physicians about the Prince gave it under their Hands which was spread abroad in several Copies that he died of a strong Malignant  Fever  after they had anatomiz'd him to amuse the World says another Writer and clear the Suspicion of Poison as if no Venoms could produce the like Effects while the King to dispel the Clouds and Monitors of Sorrow commanded that no Man should appear at Court in Mourning  Whatever was the Cause of this excellent Prince's Death  Ralegh  had no common Share in the Loss of him his Highness having but a few Months before he died obtained  Sherborne  with Intention to return it him as is already observ'd and we are further inform'd that King  James  to satisfy his Favourite  Car  who was now Viscount  Rochester  gave him instead thereof  l  in Money So far was the Crown from gaining by this Purchase But now after the Prince's Death this  Rochester  got  Sherborne  of the King again however as some Kind of Composition or Amends his Majesty we are told by  Ralegh  himself also gave his Wife and Son  l  for the said Estate But how it thrived with  Rochester  is evident enough in the Histories of those Times where it appears that in little more than three Years from this Prince's Death the said Favourite by the Title of  Earl of  Somerset  was arraigned and condemned for that black and shameful Business of poisoning Sir  Thomas Overbury  whereby he not only lost  Sherborne  but all those other Possessions which the King had so lavishly heaped upon him for what Merits or Services may better appear in those Histories than it is needful they should do here As to  Sherborne  on whom it was next bestowed and upon what Consideration with the Attempts made after  Ralegh  's Death by his Son  Carew  to recover it since the Accounts thereof would carry us too far beyond the Period in these Sheets proposed and indeed do more properly relate to the Story of the Son than the Father I shall here refer to an Abstract thereof in a brief Memorial of the said  Carew Ralegh  at the Bottom of the Page  Carew Ralegh  was born as is before observed in the  Tower  in the latter End of or Beginning of the next Year being aged about Years at his Father's Death as he tells us himself became a Gentlemancommoner of  Wadham  College in  Oxford  in as  Anthony Wood  informs us but indeed rather sooner because  Carew Ralegh  's own Words are that after having been five Years at  Oxford  he came to Court and by the Favour of  William  Earl of  Pembroke  his noble Kinsman hoped to obtain some Redress in his Misfortunes but the King not liking his Countenance said he appeared to him like his Father's Ghost Whereupon the Earl advised him to travel which he did till the Death of King  James  which happen'd about a Year after Then returning and a Parliament sitting he according to the Custom of this Land petition'd to be restor'd in Blood that he might be enabled to inherit whatever Lands might fall to him as his Father's Heir or any other Way but his Petition having been twice read in the House of Lords King  Charles  sent Sir  James Fullerton  then of the Pedchamber for Mr  Ralegh  who being brought into the King's Chamber by that Knight his Majesty after using him with great Civility told him plainly that he had formerly promised Sir  John Digby  now Earl of  Bristol  to secure his Title to  Sherborne  it being confer'd on him th of  June  against the Heirs of Sir  Walter Ralegh  whereupon  Digby  had given him being then Prince  ten thousand Pounds  so that now he was bound to make good his Promise being King and therefore unless he would quit all his Right and Title to  Sherborne  he neither could nor would pass his Bill of Restoration Mr  Ralegh  urged the Justice of his Cause that he desir'd only the Liberty of a Subject and to be left to the Law which was never deny'd any Freeman but the King was positive and so left him After this Sir  James Fullerton  used many Arguments to persuade Submission as the Impossibility of contesting with kingly Power and the many Inconveniencies of not being restor'd in Blood all which consider'd together with splendid Promises of great Preferment in Court and particular Favours from the King not improbable wrought much in the Mind of young Mr  Ralegh  who being not full twenty Years old as he says himself left friendless and fortuneless it prevailed so far that he submitted to the King's Will Whereupon there was afterwards an Act passed  Caroli  for his Restoration and together with it a Settlement of  Sherborne  to the Earl of  Bristol  and in Shew of some Kind of Recompence four hundred Pounds a Year Pension during Life was granted to Mr  Ralegh  after the Death of his Mother who had that Sum paid during her Life in Lieu of Jointure About a Twelvemonth after this Mr  Carew Ralegh  married the Lady  Philippa  Relict of Sir  Anthony Ashley  a rich young Widow by whom he had two Sons and three Daughters and was not long after at least before the Year made one of the Gentlemen of the King's Privychamber Among the ingenious Poems of  Thomas Carew  Esq who was another of those Gentlemen printed vo p there is a Compliment  To his Cousin  C R  marrying the Lady  A by which Letters are to be understood this Mr  Ralegh  and that Lady  Ashley  As for the kind Token which  Anthony Wood  says the King honoured him with at his Majesty's leaving  Hamptoncourt  and going into the  Isle of Wight anno  it was no more than a Picture of the Lady  Stanley  as I remember which was Mr  Ralegh  's own Property therefore she King among the Letters he left on the Table desired in one of them the said Picture might be returned him as may appear by those Letters which were then printed or the Extract of them in  Heath  's Chronicle In the Year and afterwards several little Tracts of his Father's were publish'd and dedicated to him In there was a Committee for the Sale of Delinquents Estates and about that Time the Earl of  Digby  being fled to  France  Mr  Ralegh  had a fair Prospect to recover his Estate therefore deliver'd his Case in to the said Committee and it was order'd 'That this Case be reported to the House with the Opinion of this Committee  That they conceive him a sit Object of their Mercy  He also about the same Time drew up a brief Relation of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Troubles and address'd it to the Parliament But whether printed before his Death I know not the Edition here used being dated three Years after nor wherefore his Case and Petition were laid aside In came out the Observations on  Sanderson  's History of King  James  which this Historian supposing to be writ by  Carew Ralegh  publish'd an Answer to it the same Year with some scandalous and unworthy Reflections therein upon him But no one has given Heed to them He certainly made his Court to the Commons of  England  in Hopes of getting  Sherborne  by their Means  Hence  Wood  says he cringed to Men in Power and was made Governor of the Isle of  Jersey  by the Favour of General  Monk  in the latter End of  January  as  Whitlock  has recorded At the Restoration of King  Charles  II his Majesty would have confer'd some personal Honour upon him but he declined it in Hopes of something better the King therefore Knighted his eldest Son  Walter  who died soon after at  West Horsels  in  Surrey  his Father's Seat which had I think been the Earl of  Dorset  's for his Will is dated from thence as a Friend who has seen it informs me This was sold after Mr  Ralegh  's Death to Sir  Edward Nicholas  Secretary to King  Charles  He had another Seat at  Kenton Park  near  Hampton Court  which I think he sold himself and dying in was buried in the Month of  December  according to  A Wood  in his Father's Grave who further says he has seen some Sonnets of his Composition and certain ingenious Discourses in MS also a Poem set to Musick by Mr  Henry Lawes  Sir  Henry Wotton  in his Letters gives him the Character of a Gentleman of dexterous Abilities and he is by others mentioned with Honour but far God wot says  Wood  was he from his Father's Parts either as to his Sword or Pen  for as  to his elder Brother  Walter  whose Right it had first been to have pursued whatever Prospect there  was of retrieving the said Estate he died before their Father as will be more particularly remembered towards the Conclusion of this Work  But which of these two Sons was attended on in his Adventures by  Ben Johnson  is not easy to distinguish from the Words of an Author who writes  That  Johnson's  Mother having married to her second Husband a Bricklayer took her Son from  WestminsterSchool  where he had made a hopeful Progress under the learned  Camden  and made him work at her Husband's Trade 'till being pitied by some generous Gentlemen  Camden  got him a better Employment which was to attend or accompany a Son of Sir  Walter Ralegh  in his Adventures whereby gaining Experience he made his Company acceptable among many  Now if this happened before  Ben Johnson  took to acting or writing of Plays as our said Author relates it did then Sir  Walter Ralegh  's eldest Son was scarce old enough to go to School much less upon Adventures Besides this Son never made that we can hear of more than one Adventure abroad from which he never returned therefore he could not part with his Attendant or Companion  Ben Johnson  in the manner our said Author intimates he did after their Return Then if we suppose it the other Brother  Carew  he never made any Adventures at all nor stir'd out of  England  till six Years after his Father's Death and then only upon a short Tour for about a Twelvemonth which was near thirty Years after  Ben Johnson  became a Dramatick Poet or Writer for the Stage and when he seems rather to have wrote himself into his Pension from the Crown or otherwise into such easy Circumstances as render it unlikely he should attend even on  Carew Ralegh  in those Sorrows and Difficulties he was then under and consequently in the whole that either one or other should part with him  not in cool Blood  as our said Author thinks after their Return Had the Time of his going abroad with the younger or the elder Brother been better adjusted that Particular of their Parting would need no Regard seeing by what Trifles what Misunderstanding between themselves or Misrepresentations by others such Divisions are made between Persons who would  or might otherwise be most serviceable and beneficial to one another  If  Ben Johnson  was of such a surly and  hypercritical  Disposition as some Men's Writings and indeed some of his own have represented him as it makes such parting the more plausible if there had ever been any such Meeting so it is probable it would have distill'd with more Acrimony from his Pen when he was giving a Character of  Ralegh  as an Author than that he could find nothing to condemn either in his Judgment or his Stile  But as for  Ralegh  's Temper to all who had Dependance upon him and they were very numerous in the Time of his Felicity especially towards those of any liberal Knowledge and Education it appears to have been of singular Candor and Benignity There are Examples further than what have been beforementioned of his Courtesy superior to that of many other great Persons in his Time towards such Men of Parts as any ways relied on his Patronage or Protection and publickly asserted by those themselves who had tasted the Benefits thereof He has also under his own Hand recommended such generous Treatment as most coercive especially to such as live under the Power or Command of others and exploded the Austere the Imperious Regimen as what is liable to betray its Practitioners no less into Peril than Disdain where he shews how contemptibly the Vain with effectual Sourness counterfeit the Gravity of the Wise because the Shadow of Reverence thereby obtained has Power to delude the Eyes only of Underlings and how thus the Time wherein by using it well Men might attain to be such as they ought they usually mispend in seeking to appear such as they are not Yet withal  not only how deceivable but dangerous a Course this is procuring instead of the Respect that was hoped for more Indignation than was feared Many other weighty Counsels and useful Precautions to this purpose are dispersed up and down his Writings both in Print and Manuscript which for brevity I forbear here to recite  But here as  Ralegh  has been occasionally mentioned in the Character of an Author we are reminded that it is high time he should be considered more particularly in that Light which cannot in any Place more properly be done than in this sedentary part of his Life when most of his Works were written Here then we are arrived at that part of his Story wherein he will appear rather a Collegian than a Captive a Student in a Library than a Prisoner in the  Tower  On this Occasion we cannot but reflect how well such Productions in such a Situation Such spacious Exercises of Genius in such a contracted State will prove that Tho' the Soul of Man by a Fly or a Hair may be separated from the Body Tyranny itself cannot confine it to the Body and at the same Time how trifling a calamity Confinement must be to those who have well employed their Liberty Some Men impatient under so many Years Restraint would have pined obscurely away by Despair and others with Rage have made their Bonds more galling But  Ralegh  as in many other Disasters so in this has left us no common Example of an heroick Mind In him we may observe there is no levelling a sublime Spirit with the Subalterns of Nature Press it on one part it will still rise in another and be like some hardy Plants we have seen whose Heads will shoot forth and flourish in the Sight of Mankind tho' their Roots are closely fettered in Walls of Stone  Happy then are they who in their Youth have so fortified themselves with Knowledge and attained to such a Relish of Literature that wheresoever they are driven by the Persecutions of Power they can make the Contemplation of Wisdom beguile the Sense of their Sufferings Who out of the most prevailing Examples in all Ages of Patience and Prudence in all Exigences can set themselves Lessons of Fortitude and Tasks of Imitations Who can out of the Misfortunes of others extract Consolations for themselves or partake in their Prosperity and make it Tributary to their own Contentment Such carry with them an infallible an undeprivable Solace which can relieve them in Poverty with inestimable Treasure manumise them in Prison with intellectual Liberty For the Multitudes of Anxieties which surprise illiterate and uncultivated Minds even in the midst of the most splendid Affluence or Adulation are inaccessible to them under the darkest Clouds of Indigence or Reproach  That  Ralegh  in his greener Years did attain to such a Taste of Letters as all his succeeding Avocations could never remove and which proved not only an Ornament to those his earlier and happier Days but a Relief in his Age and Afflictions even so as to render him under his darker Fortunes and Condition more illustrious than he was in his brightest Prosperity may appear by a Survey of his Writings from the juvenile Productions of his Pen to the more numerous and mature Offsprings of his present Confinement But in this Survey we think not the simple chronological Method will be either needful or acceptable which tho' easiest and readiest for transcribing would be most crude and disjointed in reading and yet be incapable of admitting all into their true Order because we  have not the Time that several of his Pieces were written Therefore that we may carry on our Discourse with some Coherence we shall attempt at such a Digestion as upon a little Review will naturally arise or most conveniently at least in this Place lead us as out of a flow  arden into the high Road again of publick Action for I might perhaps recommend some Variation in this Arrangement of the same Pieces if they were to be revived in a uniform and methodical Edition of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Works so that the junior Efforts of his Muse or more extemporary Products of his epistolary Correspondence might not as here for Dispatch lead up the rest  Now as for these Productions of his Muse since several of them are mentioned in the former part of these Sheets they need be here only recapitulated as his Poem on  Gascoign  's Steeleglass  The Excuse The Silent Lover the Answer to  Marloe  's Pastoral  with his Poem of  Cynthia  and two more on  Spencer  's  Fairy Queen  Since the Time that these seven were before spoken of I have met with four other such like poetical Pieces which seem also to have been composed by the same Hand from those elegant Taulologies or Retornellos wherein his Sonnets and Madrigals are usually so correspondent with one another These were all written long before this his Imprisonment as were probably some also in the  Ashmolean  Library namely  Erroris Responsio  and his Answer to the Lie c Besides we find there is a satirical Elegy on the Death of the Treasurer  Cecyll  Earl of  Salisbury  written within this Period likewise ascrib'd to him and we have still three Pieces more of his Poetry written afterwards and but a short Time before his own Death These are of a solemn Nature as his Pilgrim his Epigram in Allusion  to the Snuff of a Candle Lastly a Divine Stanza which is call'd his Epitaph  Next we might speak of those shorter Pieces also in Prose his Letters and these being written in all parts of his Life cannot perhaps be improperly  this I have seen of them in Print and Manuscript to the Number of twentyeight Fourteen or fifteen of them have already been made use of in the foregoing Sheets and the rest as they likewise are of personal Import will be serviceable in the Remainder so they need not be more particularly distinguish'd in this Place  But those more continued Compositions which were the Result of Experience and Occasion in his several publick Professions or Engagements of Life will perhaps first demand our Observation such as relate to his Character as a Warrior a Sailor a Discoverer of unknown Countries and a Politician vers'd in the Interest of Nations and the Arts of Government Among these we may first mention his military Discourses and these concern either a Defence of  England  in particular or contain general Arguments and Examples of the Causes and Reasons of War among Mankind On the former Subject he seems to have drawn up several Remonstrances which are but sparingly and slowly come to Light However from what has before been observed of his having had a principal Hand in the Determinations of the grand Council of War for putting the Nation in Arms when it was under immediate Apprehensions of the  Spanish Invasion  there is good Reason to believe he was also the Author of a Treatise containing Notes of Direction for such Defence of the Kingdom Written three Years before when the said Enemies were beginning to shew their Designs To this Treatise was  also joined a Direction for the best and most orderly Retreat of an Army whether in Campaign or Straits And these were then presented in MS to the Privycouncil Herein one Advice is since Frontier Forces are▪ unlikely to prevent an Enemy from landing that if they should land through the Deficiency or Absence of our Shipping for this is the Force  Ralegh  was ever for having first us'd against such foreign Invasions it were better by driving or clearing the Country of Provisions and temporising to endeavour at growing stronger and rendering the Enemy weaker than to hazard all by a confused and disorderly Descent of the Populace to oppose the first landing as their Custom heretofore was But this chiefly among the said Reasons and Positions for preventing an invading Enemy was a little before the Approach of the  Spanish Armada  oppugned by  Thomas Gibbes  Esq MusterMasterGeneral of her Majesty's Forces in the  LowCountries  in a Discourse of the  best Order for repulsing a foreign Force  c which he then exhibited in Print This produced an Answer which having been found in an old manuscript Copy among others of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Discourses has lately been published and which by several Circumstances therein agreeing with many in his Life as well as with several Orders in the aforesaid Council of War several Passages in his  History of the World  and his other Writings offers may Reasons to believe it was written by him  But if we would see his Opinion upon this Subject in a more extensive and universal Manner it must be in his Discourses of the original and fundamental Cause of natural and necessary arbitrary and customary holy and civil Wars which tho' also published several Years after his Death have sufficient Marks of Genuineness upon them There  are other Writings of his besides which relate to this Topick But as War in them is treated of subordinately and rather with respect to some national Advantages wherewith it might have been maintained against our Enemies as the Posture of Affairs then was or the personal Behaviour of some particular Men so we may think it more proper to speak of them under other Divisions  Among these that which admits of his maritime Discourses may not perhaps be least observable being a Subject so scarcely handled by Men of such Learning and Experience yet of such Importance to a People in our Situation And under this Head that which should here be perhaps first spoken of tho' indeed one of the last Pieces he wrote in this State of Durance is his Discourse of the Invention of Shipping c wherein he treats of the Use Defects and Improvements thereof the Strength and Deficiency of the Seaforces of  England France Spain  and  Venice  with five Causes of the Rise of the  Hollanders  His Encouragement of a mutual Friendship between them and  England  as also of the  Newcastle  Trade This might lead us more particularly to his excellent Observations and Notes concerning the royal Navy and Sea Service which he dedicated to the Prince of  Wales  as is beforementioned therefore all we need observe more of it in this Place is that herein he discourses under distinct Heads of the Officers of the Navy of some Errors to be reformed in Shipbuilding and others in harbouring and manning the Fleet of surcharging them with great Ordnance the Defects in sheathing and calking the Abuses in victualling Inconveniency of the Cookrooms of mustering and pressing Mariners of Arms and Munition and lastly of Captains to serve in his Majesty's Ships With the second Head or Chapter in  this Tract agrees his Letter to Prince  Henry  before spoken of concerning the Model of a Ship And in his Introduction to the said Observations as was also said our Author mentions a  Discourse of a maritimal Voyage with the Passages and Incidents therein  which he had formerly written to that Prince This if it is now in being must I think remain still in Manuscript for no other Knowledge of it have I elsewhere met with therefore it has I fear endured the same Fate with that other Work probably more copious and considerable and to which as what might seem designed to bring the others into Practice they may appear only preparatory This Work though taken Notice of by no other Author who has written of him is thus mentioned by himself  Of the Art of War by Sea I have written a Treatise to the Lord  Henry  Prince of  Wales  A Subject to my Knowlege never handled by any Man ancient or modern But God has spared me the Labour of finishing it by the Loss of that brave Prince of which like an Eclipse of the Sun we shall find the Effects hereafter Impossible it is to equal Words and Sorrows I will therefore leave him in the Hands of God that hath him  Curae leves loquuntur ingentes stupent This may lead us up to such of his Discourses as represent this Art in Execution particularly those two gallant naval Actions wherein Sir  Richard Greenvil  lost his Life and himself won a most signal Victory of which his own Pen has preserved the faithful Memorials in his  Report of the Truth of the Fight about the Isles of  Azores and his epistolary Account of the  Action at  Cadiz both of them before abstracted into this Work Nor did his Care terminate in the best Advice for the Regulation and Maintenance of our Shipping or in recording some of the most notable Atchievements performed therewith  but extended to the Choice and Reparation of the most convenient Harbours for their Reception and that not only by his Speeches in Parliament as we have already seen but also by a Memorial he presented to Queen  Elizabeth  touching the Port of  Dover  in particular declaring how honourable and profitable to her Majesty how necessary and commodious for the Realm the rebuilding it would be with the least expensive and most perfect manner of performing the same  But if we advance to his more extensive pursuits and performances relating to that Topick they will lead us into a new Geography into Discoveries and Descriptions of unknown Countries with the Voyages which himself and others under his charge and directions made to that Purpose And under this Head would fall those Papers and Discourses of his concerning the Discovery Plantation and Settlement of  Virginia  which were in the Possession of Sir  Francis Walsingham  as was before observed but whether now recoverable I know not nor what is become of his Treatise of the  West Indies  which seems to have been a very comprehensive Work by the short Sketch himself has given of its Contents before quoted  Better Luck seems to have befall'n his Writings upon  Guiana  for we have at least four of his Discourses on that Country in being though they probably are not all he writ thereon as first his  Considerations on the Voyage for  Guiana which I never saw in Print Secondly his  Discovery of the large rich and beautiful Empire of  Guiana which he printed himself and being before largely used and spoken of the less need be said of it here Thirdly his  Journal of his second Voyage to  Guiana This remains still in Manuscript and perhaps should do so it being unfinished and full of Chasms  seeming to contain only Notes and Observations for his own Memory when he should have leisure at his return into  England  to digest and fill up the Particulars in a continued Discourse Accordingly it seems to have supply'd him therewith when he wrote his  Apology for the said Voyage  But as both these will be made use of in the subsequent part of our Narrative 'twill be then time enough to speak more distinctly of them And there also will be mention'd the four or five Letters we have of his extant concerning the said last Expedition  After his writings becoming the Character of an able Commander both by Land and sea if we look for him as an Author in the Civil or Political Capacity we may find him there also no less eminent we may behold him in this light no less qualified to govern Nations than in the other to conquer and defend them Some of his Compositions under this Distribution are of a general Nature as that call'd the  Seat of Government  shewing it to be upheld by the two great Pillars of Civil Justice and Martial Policy and how this is fram'd out of the Husbandmen Merchants and Gentry of the Realm The rest of these Ranks or Degrees he calls the Fruit Trees of the Kingdom or those who gather the Honey yet hardly enjoy the Wax And as these feed so the second Sort enrich it nourishing such Trades as have assisted our Kings with great Sums of Money and great Fleets upon Occasion while the third Sort our Gentry he calls the Garrisons of good Order throughout the Realm or means rather they have been or should be such more than they were in these latter Times to agree with a Note he has elsewhere dropt upon them But this little Essay appears by one Expression towards the Conclusion mentioning something to be hereafter proved▪  which is not to be no more than a Fragment The like we apprehend of his  Observations concerning the Causes of the Magnificency and Opulency of Cities  from a Word in the very first Paragraph referring to such People as seem to have been before mentioned Tho' in the main this is a general Discourse it bears some particular References to a rude and barbarous People and might possibly be the Result of such Considerations as must have engaged his Mind when those Propositions were on foot for founding the City of  Ralegh  in  Virginia  as was before intimated In this little Essay after having spoken of the Means to civilize and reform such a People he proceeds under distinct Heads to treat of the best Situations of Cities for Safety and Plenty of the Multitude of Inhabitants Religion Academies Courts of Justice Artificers Privileges and Triumphs so concludes with those three Causes of confirming a City in her Greatness Justice Peace and Plenty Of a more extensive Nature still is that Treatise we have of his called  Maxims of State  being a methodical Compendium of Government in all or most of its Forms and Branches with many of its Chapters analytically digested for the sake of Brevity and Perspicuity Herein having explain'd and defin'd the Words Government Policy State and the Office of Soveraignty he proceeds to distinguish the feveral Sorts of Monarchy Aristocracy Free State Tyranny Oligarchy and Commonwealth Then of the founding a State with its Parts and of preserving it under those several Forms by Mysteries or Sophisms Rules or Actions Lastly the Conversion of States general and particular by foreign Invasion domestick Sedition or Alteration without Violence Thus ends this Treatise to which is joined as a kind of Corollary  for the better use of the Book two or three Passages in the Story of  David  From whence an Inference is drawn  that old Age is not always unfit for Government  and also a defence of that Prince for marrying  Abishag  So closes with a portrait of political Nobility in the Story of  Adonijah  aspiring to the Kingdom with Observations of the Marks to discern such Practices and another of the  Political Prince  in a farther Example of the said King  David  who tho' aged deserted and rebell'd against by many of his Nobles stirr'd up himself to publick Action and thereby shew'd his Vigour and Sufficiency to manage the Affairs of his Kingdom Herewith may be mention'd that larger Treatise bordering upon these Subjects which is call'd  The Arts of Empire  c  This was first published with the Title of  The CabinetCouncil containing the chief Arts of Empire and Mysteries of State discabineted c By the ever renowned Knight Sir  Walter Ralegh  published by  John Milton  Esq    vo  who prefixed this Motto  Quis Martem Tunica tectum Adamantina digne scripserit  The Editor's Opinion of this Book and its Author he farther offers to the Reader in these Words "Having had the MS of this Treat  se written by Sir  Walter Ralegh  many Years in my Hands and finding it lately by Chance among other Books and Papers upon reading thereof I thought it a Kind of Injury to withhold longer the Work of so eminent an Author from the publick it being both answerable in Stile to other Works of his already extant as far as the Subject would permit and given me for a true Copy by a learned Man at his Death who had collected several such Pieces  John Milton"  In the second Edition it was titled  The Arts of Empire and Mysteries of State discabineted  c vo  Lond  containing Pages and beginning with these Words  A commonwealth is a certain sovereign Government of many Families  c  but handled in a different Manner It is divided into twentysix Chapters defining publick Weals and Differencies of Sovereignty more particularly the three Kinds of Monarchy and how to perpetuate them Also of Councils and Counsellors Officers Commissioners  Magistrates and Ministers of State Of Justice Treasure and War Of Neighbouring Princes The Character of an Excellent Prince Art of Ruling Of princely Authority Power and Force Of Conspiracy and Treason publick Hatred Diffidence and Dissimulation Of War defensive and invasive Law of Arms Soldiers and their Discipline Of Generals and Commanders Councils of War Directions tactic and stratagemic with Advice how to make an honourable Peace Of Civil War with the Causes and Remedies thereof And the two last Chapters contain a Collection of Political Observations and Maxims of State or prudential Grounds and polemical Precepts concerning all States and Forms of Policy c confirm'd by select Narrations and historical Precepts  But if we descend to those political Writings of our Author which were occasionally compos'd and with more particular Regard to the Exigents of State in his own Time through the Virtues of a penetrating Eye into the Drifts of every neighbouring Nation and an undiscourageable Heart for the Security and Interest of his own we shall find them still more numerous And these as they most of them have a special Regard to  Spain  might proceed from the perfect Knowledge he had of that Kingdom and its tyrannical Practices One Instance hereof we have in that Discourse of  The  Spaniards  Cruelties to the  English  in  Havanna which is ascrib'd to Sir  Walter Ralegh  with other Tracts in a Volume among the Manuscripts of a late Person of Honour His many other Observations of this Kind might well produce his  Consultation about the Peace with  Spain and our protecting the  Netherlands  of which some Account has been before given as also that other Treatise  How War may be made with  Spain  and the  Indies mention'd in the same Place Directions for such an Enterprize may be easily presumed to have been effectually enough given by the same Hands that was also Author of  The present State of  Spain  with a most accurate Account of his Catholick Majesty's Power and Riches Also the Names and Worth of the most considerable Persons in that Kingdom  A Manuscript which I have not hitherto been so successful as to meet with Yet take it to be a different Performance from that also written by our Author and entitled  The present State of Things as they now stand between the three Kingdoms  France England  and  Spain whereof there is a Copy in being  In the  Harleyan  Library N  o  B 'Tis a Tract of about three Sheets and a Page in Folio copied as appears about the Reign of King  Charles  I and begins with these Words  the three great Kingdoms  France England  and  Spain  as they now stand may be compared to the Election of a King of  Poland  where there are three Factions and in the End two of them join'd together are able to overcome the third  Further it was this intimate Knowledge he had in the State of all the  European  Princes which so well qualified him to give the approved Advice he did in those two Discourses he wrote upon  The Match propounded by the  Savoyan  between the Lady  Elizabeth  and the Prince of  Piedmont And that  between Prince  Henry  of  England  and a Daughter of  Savoy of which we have several manuscript Copies and as I have heard the original also extant The same Knowledge likewise enabled him so dexterously to eviscerate the corrupt Doctrines and pernicious Designs of the Papists in his  Dialogue between a Jesuit and a Recusant shewing how dangerous their Principles are to Christian Princes  Another excellent Tract we have of his in this Way of Writing is his  Dialogue between a Counsellor of  State and a Justice of Peace  better known in the printed Copies by the Title of his  Prerogative of Parliaments  dedicated with a true and generous Spirit of Wisdom and Loyalty to King  James  These two Dialogues will give a perfect Taste of our Author's Manner in these his lesser Compositions and are answerable to the Character before deliver'd of his  Consultation about the Peace  abovemention'd The last Tract we have to speak of under this Partition except perhaps a short unprinted  Discourse of the Words Law and Right  also ascribed to him and to be found in the  Ashmolean  Library is intitled  Observations touching Trade and Commerce with the  Hollander  and other Nations as it was presented to King  James  wherein is prov'd that our Sea and Land Commodities serve to enrich and strengthen other Countries against our own  But as there are some Reasons to doubt whether Sir  Walter Ralegh  was the Author of this Treatise I need say no more of it in this Place yet shall throw them into a Corner of the Page  Roger Coke  in his  Detection of the Court and State of  England  during the four last Reigns  printed vo the third Edition speaking of  Ralegh  page fixes these  Observations on Trade and Commerce  upon him in these Words  'While he was thus confined he was the first who made publick the Growth by Sea of the  Dutch  and the Riches they deriv'd from their  Fishing  upon the Coasts of  England  and  Scotland  and the Consequence which would necessarily follow not only to the Loss of the King's Sovereignty of the  British  Seas but to the Trade and Navigation of  England  otherwise After that one  Tobias Gentleman  set forth another Treatise of this Nature and how this  Fishery  might be carried on from the Ports of  England  and dedicated it to the King But the King wholly giving himself up to Pleasure neither minded one nor regarded the other'  That  Gentleman  was a Fisherman or other like Seafaring Man and I have seen his Treatise but published long before this I think was which that Historian ascribes thus to Sir  Walter Ralegh  The first Edition of these Observations I could ever meet with in Print is in  mo  and it was bound up with the second Edition of  Ralegh  's  Remains  Its anonymous Publisher appears to be the Bookseller who had no other Authority for appropriating it to Sir  Walter Ralegh  but the Opinion of a Person who recommended it to him as a genuine Piece of his Writing 'Tis true our Author has touch'd after a different Manner upon the Topick in some of his Tracts and particularly at the End of his  Discourse of Shipping  where he laments  'That Strangers should be permitted to eat us out by exporting and importing both our own Commodities and those of foreign Nations'  But I think no Treatise of his will be found that descends so much into minute Examples Calculations c However not to except at this because a Treatise upon Trade may require Observations suitable to the Subject it does not appear probable that the Author of these Observations whose Project was as he tells us "To erect twenty Busses in some Seaports Town so by Degrees to extend a thousand or two over the Nation who was one that had traced this Business made his Endeavours known not only to the King but his Noblemen Merchants and others who had made him Subscriptions to disburse large Sums of Money for building up this great and rich Seacity" should be a Prisoner all this while in the  Tower  of  London  No this Projector further proposing to constitute a Statemerchant for these Purposes and praying in the Conclusion that the King would give him leave to nominate the Commissioners for conferring upon and making Report thereof to his Majesty seems to have been some manufacturing or mercantile Man one ambitious of that Office himself and consequently none of Sir  Walter Ralegh  But if from the Subject whereon we bend our Consideration to the Time when this Tract was written we shall find further Objection against entitling our Author to it For the very first Words of the Dedication are "According to my Duty I am embolden'd to put your Majesty in Mind that about or Years past I presented you a Book of such extraordinary Importance for Honour and Profit of your Majesty and Posterity and doubting it has been laid aside c I am encouraged to present you with one more c" Now if we allow the first Book to have been presented in the very first Year of the King's being in  England  then this second must have been presented in or when Sir  Walter Ralegh  was out of  England  or his Thoughts far differently engag'd But the greatest Objection of all is that there are several Manuscripts of this Treatise in the Libraries of our Nobility and Gentry more ancient than the earliest Edition in Print which as I have observ'd do all entitle it to one  John Keymer  possibly the Merchant or Vintner of that Name whom  Ralegh  many Years before had licensed to retail Wine in  Cambridge  as is related in the foregoing Part of this Life With one of these Manuscripts the most ancient I have seen among the Collections of the late Mr  Granger  there was another written also in the same little neat old Hand ascribed to the same  Keymer  and which I take to be that first mentioned in his Dedication last quoted and also to agree in its Contents with  John Keymer's Observations made upon the  Dutch  Fishery about the Year    Demonstrating there is more Wealth raised out of  Herrings  and other  Fish  in his Majesty's Seas and the neighbouring Nations in one Year than the King of  Spain  hath from the  Indies  in four And that there were twenty thousand Ships and other Vessels and about four hundred thousand People then set on Work by Sea and Land and maintained only by Fishing upon the Coasts of  England Scotland  and  Ireland Printed  vo Lond  from the original Manuscript for Sir  Edward Ford  in the Year Whoever has read these two Pieces will allow that one Hand writ them  where they may least interrupt the progressive View of his remaining Writings  These we shall divide but into two Parts and then perhaps one of them may be best comprehended under the Topic of Philosophy This Way seems to look by its Subject that short  Treatise of the Soul  ascrib'd to Sir  Walter Ralegh  whereof there is a Copy preserved among the  Ashmolean  Manuscripts It was never publish'd I think and I have not yet seen it therefore can say no more at present of it But we have in Print another Treatise which may be admitted under this Head being built on the Doctrine of  Pyrrho  the  Greek  Philosopher entitled Sir  Walter Ralegh's Sceptick or Speculations  This Doctrine shewing how much may be said  for  and  against  the same Things such an ingenious Exemplification of it as this little Tract contains may if discreetly used prevent many rash dogmatical Determinations  and inure us to a wary or prudent Suspence of Judgment For the  Sceptick  as our Author describes him does neither affirm nor deny any Position but doubts of it and opposes Reasons against that which is affirm'd or deny'd to justify his not consenting because he may report how Things appear but whether they are so he knows not This little Tract as it is here handled relates chiefly to our Senses but another we have upon a more dignified Topic as concerning our Manners or Virtues and Vices therefore what might be more particularly subdivided under the Distinction of Moral Philosophy and it is call'd  Instructions to his Son and Posterity  A Treatise well becoming an Author who had seen the World in so many Climates and Life in so many Changes It is written in a perspicuous Style with forcible Arguments and on the most practical Subjects These are interspersed with several memorable Admonitions the Fruits of his particular Experience therefore may claim a Part in his personal History and being apt to rivet in the Mind may prove of constant Use and Service as touching upon the most incidental Engagements in Life Thus in his first Chapter upon the  Choice of Friends  he says  Tho' I persuade thee to associate with thy Betters or at least with thy Peers yet remember always that thou venture not thy Estate with any of those Great Ones who shall attempt unlawful Things for such Men labour for themselves and not for thee thou shall be sure to impart with them in the Danger but not in the Honour and to venture a sure Estate at present in hopes of a better in future is mere Madness Besides great Men forget such as have done them service when they have obtained what they would and will rather hate thee for saying thou hast been a means of their Advancement  than acknowledge it I could give thee a thousand Examples I myself know it and have tasted it in all the Course of my Life  From his next Chapter on the  Choice of a Wife  we have before given Extracts in this Work His third against  Flatterers  ends with this Reflection  Thou may'st be sure that he who in private will tell thee of thy Faults is thy Friend for he adventures thy mislike and hazards thy hatred Few can endure it every Man for the most part delighting in Selfpraise one of the most universal Follies which bewitches Mankind  From the fourth Chapter on  private Quarrels  we have already given a Taste and here the chief Caution he further urges to prevent the Inconveniences thereof is ever to beware of unadvised Speech  He that cannot refrain from much speaking  says he  is like a City without Walls  And a little further  In all that ever I observed in the course of worldly Things I ever found that Mens Fortunes are oftner made by their Tongues than by their Virtues and more Mens Fortunes overthrown thereby also than by their Vices  In the fifth Chapter among the Rules recommended to preserve an Estate the most pressing is against Suretiship advising rather to give a part of what a Man has than live in continual Apprehension of losing both it and his Friend  If thou art bound says he for a Stranger thou art a Fool if for a Merchant thou puttest thy Estate to learn to swim if for a Churchman he has no Inheritance if for a Lawyer he will find an Evasion by a Syllable or a Word to abuse thee if for a poor Man thou must pay it thyself if for a rich one he needs it not Therefore from Suretiship as from a Manslayer or Enchanter bless thyself for the best Profit and Return will be this that if thou force him for whom thou art bound to pay it himself he will become thy  Enemy if thou shalt chuse to pay it thyself thou wilt be a Beggar and believe thy Father in this and print it in thy Thoughts that whatever Virtue thou hast be it never so manifold if thou be poor withal thou and thy Qualities shall be despised  In the sixth Chapter upon  Servants  he has this Advice  If thou trust any Servant with thy Purse be sure thou take his Accompt e'er thou sleep for if thou put it off thou wilt then afterwards for Tediousness neglect it I myself have thereby lost more than I am worth Whatever thy Servant gains thereby he will never thank thee but laugh thy Simplicity to scorn besides 'tis the Way to make thy Servants Thieves who else would be honest  The seventh Chapter is only a Word or two against exceeding in the Bravery of gay  Garments as what will soon wear out of Fashion when Money in the Purse will always be in Fashion  The eighth is upon  Riches  and as it seems by the Beginning should follow the Fifth herein exhorting against the Attainment of them by base or evil Means he charges his Son as never to destroy any Man for his Wealth so by no Means further to impoverish the Poor but above all Things to exercise Compassion towards them as the best Way to Prosperity and Peace of Mind  Use says he thy poor Neighbours and Tenants well pine not them and their Children to add Superfluity and needless Expences to thyself He that has Pity on another Man's Sorrow shall be free from it himself he that delights in and scorns the Misery of another shall one Time or other fall into it himself  The ninth is against the Inconveniencies of delighting in  Wine  as being the greatest Enemy to Health Trust Honour and Preferment and the last Chapter begins thus  Now for the World I know it too well to persuade thee to dive into the Practices thereof rather stand upon thy own Guard against all that  tempt the thereunto or may practise upon thee in thy Conscience thy Reputation or thy Purse resolve that no Man is wise or safe but he that is honest  So concludes with advising him to make God his Director in all his Actions  With these Instructions to his Son which have I think been oftner printed than most other of our Author's lesser Pieces there is usually joined in all the Editions I have seen  The dutiful Advice of a loving Son to his aged Father  'Tis a Religious and Rhetorical Exhortation to prepare for his latter End written in a general Manner but how probably by our Author or by either of his Sons it is left to the critical and discerning Reader All the Works I have met with further ascribed to Sir  Walter Ralegh  bearing any Affinity with this Class are two Manuscripts which might be distinguished under the Branch of Natural Philosophy  The first is his Treatise  Of Mines and the Trial of Minerals  a Subject on which he very probably might write both from his own Observations in the  WestIndies  and those Engagements he might also have in his Native County of  Devon  with his Brother Sir  Adrian Gilbert  who first in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign begun to work the long neglected Mines in  CombMartin  whence King  Edward  III had supply'd his Wars against  France  and was followed by Sir  Beavis Bulmer  who from those Mines recovered a great Quantity of Silver out of which he caused two massy Goblets to be made one whereof was presented to the Earl of  Bath  and the other weighing one hundred thirty seven Ounces to the Lord Mayor of  London  in the th of the Queen's Reign So that what  Cicero  says to his Friend of this Island that it yielded not a Drachm of that Metal was false in  Ralegh  's Time and what he could not be sure was true in his own But whether the said Treatise is so particular as to mention any Thing of this I know not having never seen it The second Manuscript is Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  Collection of Chymical and Medicinal Receipts  for fixing  Mercury  preparing  Antimony  and for the Cure of several Diseases His Application to Studies of this Kind may perhaps be somewhat accountable from the Patronage which as in a Note before cited it appears he had shewn to  John Hester  the famous Chymist with the Conversation there might probably pass between them and the Knowledge he had learn'd from the  Guianians  of curing all manner of Poisons c 'Tis apparent that he bestowed some portion of his Time upon the Use of Lembicks and Crucibles while he was in the  Tower  and seems to have had a kind of Laboratory there for his said Operations A view of him in this light will explain the Expression in a Character of him given by Dr  Joseph Hall  the venerable Bishop of  Norwich  whom Sir  H Wotton  calls the  English Seneca  where he speaks among other Things which will be hereafter observ'd of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  Philosophical Experiments  in the  Tower  And other Authors might be produced who in their Character of him also refer to his profound Knowledge in the Mysteries of Nature or his Investigations thereof through the Animal Vegetable and Mineral World for the Benefit of his Countrymen notwithstanding some memorable Attempts to advance their Prosperity in the Political World had met with much Discouragement As if tho' he could not absolutely recover them from some Indispositions or Corruptions of the Mind he was hereby resolved to try how serviceable and successful he could be against the Maladies of their Body  How elaborately soever many of these Pieces are allowed by others to have been written our Author looked upon them but as little Excursions or Sallies as he calls them from his grand Labour I mean that Ocean of History wherein he has outdone all that went before him and given such Lights to Futurity as must ever be grateful A Voyage which  If begun even in the Dawn of his Day when the Light of Knowledge first broke out upon his younger Years and before any Wound received either from Fortune or Time he might yet well have doubted as he observes himself that the Darkness of Age and Death would have overtaken him long before the Performance  But being undertaken as it was in the Evening of a tempestuous Life a Life so far run out in Travels and Considerations of such opposite Nature for one under the soulpiercing Privations of Honour Fortune Freedom One buried alive to attempt such a universal Revival of the Dead And while his Body under all those pressures was so long incarcerated for his Brain to be delivered of that  Minerva  as one calls it his  History of the World  is an Example that might puzzle such an Historian even as  Ralegh  himself to parallel For beginning at the Creation he has given us the Flower of recorded Story down to the End of the second  Macedonian  War Thus having reviewed the three first Monarchies of the World he leaves  Rome  in the fourth Triumphant about a Century and a half before the Birth of Christ comprehending a period of near four thousand Yeas This Work was divided by our Author into five Books who annexed to it a very copious and useful Chronological Table and it was with the further Decorations of Maps Tables of Genealogy c publish'd in the Month of  April  just before the Meeting of the Parliament in a  large Volume  Folio  The Approbation it has met with since the Author's Death has been so universal that if they are different Editions of the Book to which we may see different Dates printed we may venture to say no Work of any Author in  England  has been so often reprinted that is of equal Size and Antiquity The several Characters and Commendations which have been bestow'd on this History as well by miscellaneous Writers who have frequently quoted it with great Deference and Respect as by Historians and Criticks who have closely traced and throughly examin'd it and as well in Verse as Prose would be too numerous to be here inserted could they be recover'd To provide therefore as well against the Ignorance as the Satiety of those Readers who have not met with them a few are presented in the Annotation here directed to  This may not perhaps be better introduced than in the Reflection of Bishop  Hall  who in his ingenious Book of  Consolations  has these Words "A wise Man as  Laurentius  the Presbyter observed well does much in Solitude So may'st thou employ the Hours of thy close Retiredness and bless God for so happy an Opportunity How memorable an Instance has our Age afforded us of an eminent Person to whose Imprisonment we are all obliged besides many philosophical Experiments for that noble History of the World now in our Hands The Court had his youthful and freer Years and the Tower his latter Age the Tower reformed the Courtier in him and produced those worthy Monuments of Art and Industry which we should have in vain expected from his Freedom and Jollity It is observed that shining Wood when it is kept within Doors loses its Light it is otherwise with this and many other active Wits which had never shin'd so much if not for Closeness" Thus in a Treatise call'd  Balm of  Gilead  or Comforts for the Distress'd both moral and divine by Dr  Joseph Hall  Bishop of  Norwich mo afterwards reprinted under the Title of  The Art of Patience  c vo In the  Familiar Letters  of  James Howel  Esq speaking of this rare and renowned Knight he says "His Fame shall contend in  Longaevity  with this Island itself yea with that great World which he Historises so gallantly" In another wellknown Book of his call'd  Dodona  's  Grove  or  The Vocal Forest  discoursing of  Ralegh  and describing him to have been "A Cavalier of a spacious Understanding and of no vulgar Reach in Policy scientifical and full of abstruse Notions he adds "That tho' his Body was under Restraint and coffin'd up so many Years yet he never travers'd more Countries than then for his Brain ran over all the World as appears by that famous Monument he transmitted to Posterity and hung up in the Temple of Fame while he was as it were buried alive" But in the Life of the Lord  Stafford  written by  Anthony Stafford  Esq to this Author goes so far as to say That if Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  History of the World  had been written in the  Indian  Tongue we should not have scrupled or avoided the Pains of learning that Language only to read it If we consult what Character the Historians give it we may find many of them who never name it without some Epithet or Sentence in its Praise Thus Dr  Heylin  in one Place calls it an  excellent History  in another the  first or chief of Histories  And thus in the Preface of Dr  William Howell  's  Universal History  who must have had continual Occasions of inspecting our Author's 'tis said That  Sir  Walter Ralegh  is never to be mentioned without Honour Shirley  in his Life of our Author gives it as his Judgment of his History "That for the Exactness of its Chronology Curiousness of its Contexture and Learning of all Sorts it seems to be the Work of an Age" And a little further "That a Man who had been the greatest Part of his Life taken up in Action should write so judiciously so critically of Times and Actions is as great a Wonder as the Book itself and it still remains in Doubt whether the Age he liv'd in was more oblig'd to his Pen or his Sword the one being busy in conquering the new the other in so bravely describing the old World" And Mr  Echard  in the Preface of his  Roman  History admires that Part of  Ralegh  's History which treats of the  Roman  Story "Especially the last Hundred Years which says he are written with very much Spirit and Judgment and all of it with as much Skill and Clearness yet that all before the first  Panick  War is not proportionably copious to the rest' But how duly it was considered by this particular Historian whether that was not a judicious Disproportion in our general Historian may be left to the Examination of others  To this we may join the Character of Dr  Henry Felton  in his  Dissertation upon the Classicks  where he says "Sir  Walter Ralegh  's  History of the World  is a Work of so vast a Compass such endless Variety that no Genius but one adventurous as his own durst have undertaken that great Design I do not apprehend any great Difficulty in collecting and commonplacing an Universal History from the whole Body of Historians that is nothing but mechanick Labour But to digest the several Authors in his Mind to take in all their Majesty Strength and Beauty to raise the Spirit of meaner Historians and to equal all the Excellencies of the best this is Sir  Walter  's peculiar Praise His Stile is the most perfect the happiest the most beautiful of the Age he wrote in majestick clear and manly and he appears every where so superior rather than unequal to his Subject that the Spirit of  Rome  and  Athens  seems to be breathed into his Work"  He took no ordinary Care to deserve these Encomiums for besides his own Learning Knowledge  and Judgment which many would have thought sufficient for any Undertaking he with that Caution wherewith we have beheld so many others of his great Enterprizes temper'd would suffer no Part of this History to pass his own Hand before some of the most able Scholars whom he assemhled it seems for this Purpose had debated the Parts he was most doubtful of and they most conversant in before him Thus in the  Mosaic  and  Oriental  Antiquities or fainter and more remote Footsteps of Time he would sometimes consult the learned Dr  Robert Burhill  In all Parts of Chronology Geography and other Branches of mathematical Science he wanted not the Opinions of the learned  Hariot  and the Earl of  Northumberland  's three  Magi  long his Neighbours in the Tower and wherever he scrupled any Thing in the Phrase or Diction he would hear the acute and ingenious Sir  John Hoskyns  sometime also Resident in these Confines who viewed and reviewed the said History as we are told before it went to the Press and whom  Ben Johnson  proud of calling others his Sons could gratify that Humour in calling Father Thus having spared no Labour and neglected no Means to bring this Work to the Perfection wherein we behold it 'tis no Wonder that some Scribbler or other should upon finding it so universally read endeavour to raise himself a little Profit or Credit from it by pretending that the World needed an Abridgment of its History as if that wherewith Sir  Walter Ralegh  has presented us either is or was intended for any Thing more But this more specious Kind of Detraction meeting with no Countenance the Author of it threw out another of Animadversions upon this History but as insignificant and no less disregarded than the other being agreeable to that unhappy Spirit of Contradiction which ever harrass'd him to oppose the greatest Writers in his Time  But that which is more considerable concerning this History is whether our Author ever continued it down to his own Times and whether on some Pretence that this first Part did not meet with Encouragement he ever destroyed the said Continuation himself as we have it in the Mouths of every Body when they speak of him but in the Belief of nobody who knows any Thing of his Story or his Character All that he says himself in the least glancing this Way is first in his Preface  That he proposed to confine his Discourse with this our renowned Isle of  GreatBritain And  That he forbears to promise a second or third Volume which he intends if the first receives Grace and good Acceptance for that which is already done may be thought enough and too much  Lastly in the Conclusion of the  History  he says  Whereas this Book by the Title calls itself  The first Part of the General History of the World  implying a second and third Volume which I also intended and have hewn out besides many  Discouragements persuading my Silence it has pleased God to take that glorious Prince out of the World to whom they were directed whose unspeakable and neverenough lamented Loss has taught me to say with  Job Versa est in luctum cithera mea organum meum in vocem flentium From hence it seems plain enough that our Author had only some Plan or perhaps a few rough Draughts of some succeeding Parts of the History at this Time drawn up and that he was discouraged from making any further Progress in them Allowing his Mind might change and that there was Time enough to finish the remaining Volumes between this Year and that of his Death which is scarcely allowable yet as we know how most of that Time was employ'd by him it will admit of no room for any such Performance For in the Year which followed that wherein he publish'd his History two at least of his most elaborate Tracts beforemention'd were written The same Year he was also busy in writing Letters and making other Interest for his Releasement which he obtain'd before it was quite expired After this it will no less appear that he made himself too eminently the subject of modern History to be any further an Author of that which is ancient There is indeed a little Intimation of the Design he had upon some ancient Part of our  English  Story preserved in a Letter of his own written it seems tho' undated before his great Work was publish'd to that Acquaintance whose Library was most likely to accommodate him with those uncommon Books which he wanted for his Purpose This Letter is as follows  Sir  Robert Cotton  If you have any of these old Books or any Manuscripts wherein I may find any of our  British  Antiquities if you please to lend them me for a little  while I will safely restore them and think myself much beholden unto you Or if you have any old  French  History wherein our Nation is mentioned or any else in what Language soever  So subscribes himself  Your poor Friend  W Ralegh But this does not sufficiently assure us whether the Use of these Books was to continue his  General History  or furnish him upon some more particular Subject however we may incline with the Writer of Sir  Robert Cotton  's Life to the former Opinion And as for the Reasons of one ingenious Author  why Sir  Walter Ralegh  was the most proper Person to write the History of his own Time  and the Opinion of another  That his admirable Performance already published sufficiently shews that if he had attempted the  History of his own Country or his own Times  he would have excell'd even  Livy  or  Thucydides  and that the Annals of Queen  Elizabeth  by his Pen without diminishing from the serious and judicious  Camden  had been the brightest Glory of her Reign and would have transmitted his History as the Standard of our Language even to the present Age  These are still no Affirmatives that he did finish such a second Part So that his own Intimations in the first Part reserv'd and inconclusive as they are seem to have been the only Foundation of that formal Story  How Sir  Walter Ralegh  a few Days before his Death sent for  Walter Burre  the Bookseller who had printed his first Volume and taking him by the Hand asked him How that Work of his had sold who answer'd So slowly that it had undone him hereupon  Ralegh  stepping to his D sk reach'd out the other Part of his History which he had brought down to the Times he liv'd in then saying with a Sigh Ah Friend has the first Part undone thee the second Volume shall undo no more this ungrateful  World is unworthy of it so stept to the Fire threw it in and set his Foot on it till it was consum'd  But as we observed before  Ralegh  had no Leisure to finish such a Second Part of his History down to his own Time In the next Place 'tis no ways probable that he who in Regard to the first Part could follow the Rule of  Seneca  that he who  having satisfied his own Conscience could disregard the Censure of others  should sacrifice so great a Part of his Labours or any Part in such a rash and inconsiderate Manner to the sudden Representations of a Bookseller without ever suspecting any mercenary Ends in him Further it does not appear true that the first Part did sell slowly for there was a second Edition of it set forth by that very Bookseller within three Years after the first and lastly the first Man we can meet with who reports the same is a trifling and superficial Writer who produces no Authority for his Assertion  As to the unfinish'd Parts he might have of such a Continuation to admit that they were thus destroy'd would moreover in no wise agree with an Account we have more satisfactorily attested of that great Quantity there was in Being of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's unprinted Writings several Years after his Death For it is affirm'd to us  That the famous Mr  Hamden  a little before the Civil Wars was at the Charge of transcribing    Sheets of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Manuscripts as the Amanuensis himself told me says my Author who had his close Chamber his Fire and Candle with an Attendant to deliver him the Originals and take his Copies as fast as he could write them  Yet what is become of this Treasure now I have not been able to learn for if we suppose that Mr  Hamden  would not be at the Trouble and Charge of transcribing any of  our Author's Writings which had then been printed and grant that all of his which have been printed since that Time as well as all we can hear of remaining in MS which are allow'd to be his were Part of that Collection or Quantity they will not both join'd together as might be computed from what is here observed of them amount to a fourth Part thereof tho' we should admit two or three Pieces more also ascribed to him which have not yet been named and happen to fall under his historical Division The First of them is call'd  A notable and memorable Story of the cruel War between the  Carthaginians  and their own Mercenaries Gather'd out of  Polybius  and other Authors by that famous Historian Sir  Walter Ralegh The other two Pieces might seem to fall within the intended Continuation of his Universal History but the first of them call'd  The Life and Death of  Mahomet  the Conquest of  Spain  together with the Rising and Ruin of the  Saracen  Empire  ascribed to Sir  Walter Ralegh  near twenty Years after his Death by the Bookseller who dedicated it to his Son is except a few Leaves about that of  Mahomet  no more than a Translation of an Epitomy made by some ignorant  Spanish  Author chiefly from what one of his own fabulous Countrymen had written of a fictitious Prince named  Jacob Almansor  as I have been assur'd by a Gentleman of great Knowledge both in the  Spanish  and  Oriental  Writers But the Stile itself so uncouth in some Places so meagre in others and incorrect especially in known Things Places and Persons might of itself exclude our Author from having any hand it The other Piece is stiled  An Introduction to a Breviary of the History of  England  with the Reign of King  William I  entitled the Conqueror written by Sir  Walter Ralegh It was near  fourscore Years after his Death before this was publish'd Yet there are several old manuscript Copies of it in the Libraries of the Curious which entitle him the Author of it but it was written at least two Years before he publish'd his  History of the World  because it was inscribed to a Person who died so long before the said Publication in these Words  I intend by the Help of God and your Furtherance right noble Earl of  Salisbury  to write a brief History of  England  from  William  the First entitled the Conqueror to the End of Queen  Elizabeth  of perpetual Memory  But by then his  History of the World  was finish'd he was as we have observed also from his own Words discouraged from all Continuation To these Discouragements might be added the ungrateful Treatment which was shewn to this Part he did publish at its first Appearance For tho' we have observed what universal Approbation it has met with since the Author's Death yet how it was rereceiv'd as soon as it came abroad and made its first Visits at Court we are yet to relate  Those who thought the King must needs be a Patron of Authors because he was one of the Number have been ready to insinuate that his Favour encreased towards  Ralegh  in Proportion to the Proofs his Pen had given of his Abilities therefore that his many excellent Writings and especially this  History of the World  were the most powerful Intercessors for his Releasment out of the Tower as if his Majesty in respect to his own Honour thought it in vain longer to confine his Person since no Condition could confine his Fame or in Regard to  Ralegh  's Merit that he had well deserved no Place should be a Barrier to his Liberty who had given such extraordinary Testimony that no Age could set a Bound to his Knowledge  Sanderson  has describ'd the Freedom which not long after ensu'd to one of those Motives where he says  Sir  Walter Ralegh  wearied with long Imprisonment and having there spent his Time well in the  History of the World  made his Petition more passable to the King whose Love to Learning granted him now at last his Liberty and not long after Leave to wander after a Design to the Western World where he had been in several Climates before  But others who seem to have known the Matter much better or have more ingenuously imparted it assure us that  Ralegh  's excellent Talents were so far from ingratiating him with the King  that tho' his Majesty had been intemperately praised by Flatterers for some of the weakest of his own Compositions yet he could not forbear out of an impertinent Emulation to affect Sir  Walter Ralegh  the less because of the great Repute which followed him for his excellent Pen  Nay we are elsewhere told in Answer to  Sanderson  above that  Ralegh  's  History of the World  gave the King so much Displeasure  that at its first Publication it was forbid and particularly for some Passages in it which offended the  Spaniard  as also for being too plain with the Faults of Princes in his Preface  For it is indeed replenish'd with many remarkable Examples of divine Vengeance pour'd forth on Princes of many other Nations as well as our own who strove to establish their Thrones by Oppression and Iniquity That Passage in Answer to  Sanderson  is so far from being deny'd by this Writer that he afterwards confirm'd it in Contradiction to what himself had written as above about  Ralegh  's Petition being made more passable by his History where after his gross Manner of Interpretation he says  King  James  and all other Princes had Cause of Complaint because his whole Book sets out the Eastern Monarchs  with much Glory and exclaims against Christian Princes as most inhuman tracing all the  English  Sovereigns from the Conquest especially  Henry  the Eighth whom for his Daughter's Honour Sir  Walter Ralegh  might have spar'd from Gall and Bitterness  And a little further  King  James  might perhaps observe more to repress the Wickedness of such a Person who under Pretence of taxing a Vice in the Father intended cunningly to stain the whole Race  c This Objection against  Ralegh  's Character of the King is more particularly ascribed to King  James  by another Writer also beforecited who tells us  That after much Scorn cast upon  Ralegh's  History the King being modestly demanded What Fault he found answered as one surprized That  Ralegh  had spoken irreverently of King  Henry  the Eighth  as if he would have reflected a Breach of Gratitude upon our Historian towards his Benefactress the late Queen In speaking such Truth when he was to give a Character of her Father as not only others who read it must concur in seeing the Historian has so many Proofs at his Finger's End to confirm it but what that King himself were he alive on whom it was written must also have allowed since it is only a Paraphrase upon his own dying Confession that he had been  a Prince who never spared Man in his Anger nor Woman in his Lust  But if King  James  could thus object against  Ralegh  for one Character and pay him no Thanks for another which follows in the same Paragraph of that Preface and in some Parts of the History itself this may perhaps best shew where lay the Breach of Gratitude But however his Majesty might think it a Kind of Blasphemy that any below the Dignity of Princes should be the Censors of them Yet that Objection aforesaid seems not to be the natural Cause says our lastquoted  Author of his Dislike to this History  since none ever exclaim'd more against that Prince than usually King  James  himself did  And others more particularly still are inclin'd to believe that any Liberty  Ralegh  may have taken with the Characters of other Princes was not so much the real Cause of such Disgust in King  James  as through the Insinuations of some mischievous Sycophants about him who knew well what Humour might be most agreeably fed that several Parts of the History contained an oblique and artful Exposure of himself and his Ministry as if truly the general  History of the World  was chiefly a secret History or Satire upon his Court and  Scotch  Faces were to be seen in it stuck upon old  Jewish Babylonian  or  Assyrian  Shoulders For as one has observ'd  There was a Time when one of our most renowned Historians could not comment upon a Piece of the  Old Testament  without being thought to write a Libel upon his own Times and the King was almost led to fancy he saw his own Features in the Face of  Ninias  the Son of Queen  Semiramis  but surely if he could think his Justice censured in the Story of  Ahab  's taking away  Naboth  's Vineyard and not commended in that of the  French  King's Conduct towards his Judge and Admiral of  France  he must not only have been a very captious and selftormenting Reader but have satiriz'd himself more sharply by engrossing of Application or acquiescing in Resemblances than he could have been by that Author had he really intended any  But the Truth is that conscious Minds can find in every Example something to chastise themselves and to Stomachs vitiated through foul and unwholsome Administrations with evil Habits the most innocent Diet is upbraiding That  Ralegh  soresaw his Enemies would make such perverse Construction and Misuse of his  History is evident enough in his own Words where mentioning the Choice he had made at least exceptionable of the elder Times to describe he yet anticipates this Objection  Against this Choice also Why may it not be said that in speaking of the pass'd I point at the present and tax the Vices of those who are yet living in their Persons who are long since dead and have it laid to my Charge But this I cannot help tho' innocent and certainly if there be any who finding themselves spotted like the Tygers of old Time shall find Fault with me for painting them over anew they shall therein accuse themselves justly and me falsely  Yet such Fault there was we see found and so falsely was he accused Thus the Honour which should reward a publick Benefit is stifled by private Prejudice  We are therefore to seek some other Mediator for  Ralegh  's Deliverance out of Prison than his Merit by this publick Benefit and that we shall at last find to be his Money tho' other Causes in our common Histories are also suggested especially that which seemed most effectual the Offer he made of fitting out an Expedition to secure and possess for the Crown a Gold Mine in  Guiana  which he had himself discover'd when he was formerly in that Country and which since that Time had been by others so amply testified that further Confirmation was not now requir'd So that  Ralegh  's being deceiv'd by  Keymis  with Ore of a golden Complexion which he brought from thence or by any chymical Tricks such as secretly slipping real Gold with the Ore into the Meltingpot are foolish Untruths Now that Offer  Ralegh  had made at least three Years before he obtain'd his Liberty with no unreasonable Expectation of its being accepted since King  James  had so publickly asserted and confirm'd the Right of  England  to that Country through Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Conquest and Discoveries therein with the Submission he had gain'd from the chief Lords thereof as to have given Commissions and Patents for the Possession of the same that is to say all from the River of  Amazons  to the  Dessequebe  and all the Islands for twenty Miles about in his Majesty's Name which were accordingly executed in all due Form by Captain  Charles Leigh  and Captain  Robert Harcourt  which last left a Colony there of thirty Persons for three Years as may be read at large in the Narratives of their several Expeditions Besides the publick Invitations and Encouragement which afterwards ensued to all who would again settle and plant in that new discover'd Part of  America  gave the Discoverer himself no doubt the greater Hopes that his own Propositions being not for his private but the publick Benefit yet at his own Expence and that of such Friends as he should engage in the Adventure could not but be embrac'd Add to this the Advantages of his further knowing the Riches of this Country even while he was in Prison not only by the long Conversation he had with those  Indians  whom we find here with him in the former Part of his Confinement but others who from Time to Time came over to him For during this long Imprisonment he held constant Intercourse with  Guiana  and was at the Charge every Year or every second Year of sending a Ship or more thither to keep them in Hopes of being relieved from the  Spaniards  who had again encroach'd upon them and cruelly massacred both several of the Natives and of his own Men So that the Number of Voyages he set forth for  Guiana  was at least as many if not more than those he is before observed to have fitted out for  Virginia  But all this Experience which should have recommended his Offer serv'd at first only to render it unacceptable For the Treasurer  Cecyll  being then alive he with two or three others who bore the Sway at Court were resolved to discountenance it not that they so much doubted the Probability that such Treasure might remain unpossess'd or the Knowledge and Resolution of  Ralegh  to compass it so much as his Disposition towards themselves if by a successful Return he should purchase the King's Favour Therefore to prevent such a Rival as he might prove to them the Advantage he propos'd to the State was neglected nay so deeply had they rooted Prejudices in the King's Breast towards him in this particular as well as in others beforementioned that when his Majesty was sollicited by any Person in  Ralegh  's Behalf and Royal Sollicitors he had he with that implicit Reliance on other Men's Reports which those in supreme Station so often bury their own Judgments and their Justice in would answer  That his Council knew him better than he did  But after  Cecyll  's Death and now that Sir  Ralph Winwood  was Secretary of State  Ralegh  reviv'd his Proposal to him and in a Letter told him with relation to those two or three Earwigs who were ever crawling about the King and at the Mercy of whose Representations he had so long lain that it was his only Infelicity the King did not know him as well as those Courtiers pretended to do  For had his Majesty known me  says he  I had never been here where I now am or had I known his Majesty they had never been so long there where they now are His Majesty not knowing me has been my Ruin and his misknowing them has been the Ruin of a goodly Part of his Estate But they are all of them now some living and some  dying come to his Majesty's Knowledge  We learn furtherout of the said Letter that both Queen  Anne  who had inform'd herself from the Beginning of all that  Ralegh  had been accus'd with and her Brother the King of  Denmark  at both times of his being in  England  were thoroughly satisfy'd of his Innocency otherwise they would never have moved his Majesty in his Behalf And Prince  Henry  who had been curious in searching into the Nature of his Offences had been frequently a Mediator for him as we have read before Hereupon says  Ralegh The Wife the Brother and the Son of a King do not use to sue for Men suspect but since they have all done it and with Reference to me alone you strengthned by their Example may with the more Hardiness do the like  Towards the End  Ralegh  having acknowledged that all he had remaining was owing to the King and that he was ready to sacrifice it all in his Majesty's Service concludes with this noble Distinction  To die  for  the King and not  by  the King is all the Ambition I have in the World  This and other like Addresses to that new Secretary advanced not  Ralegh  's Request so much but he found it necessary to use stronger Interest than what he was here making and more substantial Arguments than could flow from a Pen For whatever  Pity of his Sufferings his Merit and Fame of Learning now begat in many or by whatever means of the  French  Ambassador with others of our own Lords  it is pretended in our common Accounts of him that  he got Freedom of repairing for his Health to his House at  St James's  a Year or two before he procured his Commission for his Voyage to  Guiana we are more positively and particularly told  That Sir  William St John  and Sir  Edward Villiers  Halfbrother to the Lady  Villiers  afterwards Dutchess  of  Buckingham  procured Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Liberty and had fifteen hundred Pounds for their Labour  It further appears that these used their Power with Sir  George Villiers  the new rising Favourite at Court and so obtained the King's Consent for  Ralegh  's Enlargement For there is a Letter of  Ralegh  's Acknowledgments to that Favourite in these Words  Sir You have by your Mediation put me again into the World I can but acknowledge it for to pay any part of your Favour by any Service of mine as yet it is not in my Power If it succeed well a good Part of the Honour shall be yours and if I do not also make it profitable unto you I shall shew myself exceeding ungrateful In the mean while and till God discover the Success I beseech you to reckon me among the Number of your faithful Servants tho' the least able  W Ralegh This Letter is dated only  March  but probably written in this Year last mentioned because three Days afterwards as  Camden  has precisely remember'd Sir  Walter Ralegh  was released out of the  Tower  So that he thus purchas'd his Liberty in the thirteenth Year of his Confinement that is to say after he had been without Intermission twelve Years three Months and five Days in the said  Tower  of  London  besides near three Months more at his first Commitment thither and during his Arraignment at  Winchester  At this Time  Carr  Earl of  Somerset  had been about four or five Months in the said Tower with his Countess for the barbarous Impoisonment of Sir  Thomas Overbury  about two Years before in the same Place to which he had treacherously driven him for only having obstructed the said Earl's vile and scandalous Commerce with that lewd Woman while she was young  Essex  's Wife  These two Accidents at this Time drew great Notice happening  as 'tis observed in a Tract ascribed to the Lord  Brook  so much beyond all Expectation that the one being a special Favourite of the King the other a condemned Man the one imprison'd the other set at Liberty gave great Occasion of Speech and Rumour and so much the more Wonder and Admiration because of  Ralegh  's Wit and Policy Raleigh  is further said by the same Author to have given  Somerset  many Quips and Taunts during his said Imprisonment and it may not be improbable towards such an undeserving Intruder upon his Estate But as this Earl of  Somerset  was convicted of Felony for the said Murder whereby the Two hundred thousand Pounds he had heap'd up and Lands to the Income of Nineteen thousand Pounds  per Annum  being again dispers'd and as the King had laid that heavy Curse upon himself and his Posterity which he did if ever he pardon'd any of the said Murderers it might have been thought that  Ralegh  's Comparison of himself and that noble Malefactor would not have been spoil'd when he said  That the whole  History of the World  had not the like Precedent of a King's Prisoner to purchase Freedom and his Bosom Favourite to have the Halter but in Scripture in the Case of  Mordecai  and  Haman Instead of that  Ralegh  is said by the Relater of this Passage to have been told the King should reply upon hearing this Observation▪  That  Ralegh  might die in that Deceit  and so he did as this Author truly says For the King now sav'd the Life of the one as much to the Astonishment of the World as he afterwards put the other to Death But he could do no less if his Favourite was really a Master of such Secrets as are elsewhere spoken of And this is enough to resolve why the Misfortunes of that Earl if they may be called such which at the Worst were more favourable  than his Merits in any wise deserved were not equal to his Crimes  Ralegh  being thus at Liberty soon appears busy in making Preparation for his Voyage To this Purpose he called in the Pounds which he had lent to the Countess of  Bedford  reckon'd in King  James  his Declaration a competent Satisfaction for  Sherborne  tho' it was afterwards valued by the State at  l per annum  But seeing that not sufficient to fit out a Fleet in the Manner he found necessary his Wife consented also to sell her House and Lands at  Micham  in  Surrey  for which he received  l  all which and more he expended in this Expedition And what Frenzy could possess him as he says himself thus to dispose of his whole Substance and undertake such a toilsome and perilous Voyage now that his Constitution was impair'd by such a long Confinement besides Age itself Sickness and Affliction were he not assur'd thereby of doing his Prince Service bettering his Country by Commerce and restoring his Family to their Estates all from the Mines of  Guiana  and says he  if I myself had not seen them with my own Eyes  I have not yet heard who was the Purchaser of that Estate at  Micham  but there is a Letter of  Ralegh  's to a Nobleman extant which possibly relates thereunto It is to intreat him to make an impartial Valuation of some Lands to a rising Favourite who was to be the Purchaser and is penn'd in the following Words  I humbly beseech your Lordship to give me Leave and Pardon too if I need it for the answering of those Things which you were lately pleas'd to object against me and that you will charitably also consider both of my Demands and of the Reasons which embolden me to make them Those Answers go here in a Paper which is enclos'd apart and my Letter shall say but  thus much that the Gentleman who is so greatly in favour hath many fair Fortunes before him and we nothing to look for but Misery and that he is better able to give us above the Worth of the Land than we in condition to abate any Part thereof And therefore we humbly beseech your Lordship that your  Compassion  and Care of  Honour  may be the Judge between his prosperous Navigation and our Shipwreck And that your  Charity  for us and your Desire of  Satisfaction  for him may equal the Ballance between us I hope so heartily to find all just Favour at your Hands as I will venture upon this to ossure you that I will do all my utmost to make my Wife and Son forget themselves and be ever mindful of their Duty towards your Lordship to whom I hope they will be as I am sure myself have been and am a most faithful humble Servant  Besides the ten thousand five hundred Pounds which it cost Sir  Walter Ralegh  to put himself in Equipage for this longproposed Voyage a much greater Sum than would have paid for his Liberty of receding from it or for a formal Pardon had he thought he needed and had gone about to purchase it there were many Coadventurers who by Contributions to the Expence thereof intitled themselves to a Share in the Returns But most of these are called by  Ralegh  a Company of Voluntiers who had never seen the Sea nor Wars and except some forty Gentlemen a very dissolute disorderly and ungovernable Crew  whom their Friends thought it an exceeding good Gain to be discharged of at the Hazard of some thirty forty or fifty Pounds knowing they could not have lived a whole Year so cheap at Home  There were moreover several Merchants not only in  England  but foreign Parts who contributed to this  MineAdventure  so confident were they that it was no  Chimera no supposititious or airy Treasure that was promised or pursued One of these Merchants afterwards knighted and very eminent for his Dealings was named  Peter Vanlore  who so approved of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Undertaking that he not only sent a Letter to his Brother Sir  Adrian Thibaut  in  Amsterdam  requesting him to engage another Merchant there to communicate something he knew of the Riches in  Guiana  to Sir  Walter Ralegh  but made that Request in  Ralegh  's own Manner of Expression from a Copy which he drew up for him This Draught as I have it from the said Original is as follows Brother  Tibotes There is a Merchant in  Amsterdam  that for the Love he bears to my honourable Friend Sir  Walter Ralegh  is content to discover somewhat of Importance unto him in  Guiana  to which Country Sir  Walter Ralegh  is now preparing to go but he doth require Assarance from Sir  Walter Ralegh  that he himself may be assured to enjoy such Part of the Commodity discover'd as he shall agree upon with Sir  Walter Ralegh  by his Deputy Mr  Henry Hovenar  I do therefore pray you to speak with the Party which Mr  Hovenar  will bring unto you and to know what Assurances he will require which to pleasure Sir  Walter  I shall be willing to give that is to say to give him Assurance that upon Sir  Walter  's Return into  England  the Charges being deducted the Discoverer shall receive from Sir  Walter  such Part of the said Merchandize as Sir  Walter  and he shall agree on altho' there needs no such Assur  n  e to be given because his Majesty doth assure all Sir  Walter  's Partners by the Great Seal of  England That they shall truly and quietly enjoy all their Parts and Shares of what Goods Merchandize or Treasure soever shall be returned  out of which Great Seal of  England  the Discoverer shall have an Assignment for so much as belongs  unto him to be deliver'd here in  London  to whomsoever he shall appoint to receive it"  Then in a new Line he concludes thus  To Mr Peter Vanlore This is the Letter which I desire you to write to your Brother in  Amsterdam  and for any Assurance you shall give I will again put you in Sureties to save you harmless  W Ralegh This Letter is dated  July  And if  Ralegh  had his Commission for that Voyage before this Time as it appears he had by his citing it then it must be erroneously dated being near two Months after in King  James  's Declaration Here again that Commission seems to have been given under the Great Seal of  England  and also elsewhere In that Declaration 'tis said to be under the Privy Seal But there are other Things observable of this Commission as it is there printed and in other Places as we shall see presently  In the mean while we may here observe a little Opposition that was made to this Voyage And indeed some Persons at Court who might remember what Advances  Ralegh  had formerly made there by the Means of several Exploits which he undertook at a Distance from it and others admonish'd by Conscience that every friendly Gale in his Navigation would be splitting them upon a Rock might well be expected to obstruct as far as they could his Progress But none do we hear of so impatient and clamorous against it as the  Spaniard  For there had been now in  England  about three Years an Agent from  Spain  named  Diego Sarmiento de Acuna  better known but not till about the Time of  Ralegh  's Death or perhaps after it by the Title of Count  de Gondomar  a Man who if he gain'd that Influence he did over King  James  purely by Art must be allowed a good Share of Dexterity in the Mysteries of Negotiation but as he  was adapted by Nature to sooth and captivate him no less than by the Pretensions of his Agency it diminishes the Wonders of his Success in making that King such a Subject to his Enchantments and keeping him so many Years a  Prisoner  as it were in the  Tower  he had heap'd up of airy and glittering Promises Yet what Reward was reserved for all his Services here in his own Country and how this ardent Slave to the Will and Pleasure of his Master was both Executioner of his Royal Pride as well as other Passions and Sacrifice also at last to them must be left for those to display who have more Leisure to dilate upon such Retaliations of Providence This was the Man who as he is represented in King  James  's Declaration now  took great Alarm and is said to have made loud and vehement Assertions to his Majesty in repeated Audiences that he knew and had discover'd the Intention and Enterprize of Sir  Walter Ralegh  to be but hostile and piratical tending to the Breach between the two Crowns and the Danger and Destruction of the King his Master's Subjects in those Parts protesting in a sort against it  To which that the King should answer as it is there said after  Ralegh  's Death  He would send Sir  Walter Ralegh  with a limited Commission  but how limited it was will soon appear and that  he durst not upon Peril of his Head do any such Matter and if he did he would surely do Justice upon him or send him bound Hand and Foot into  Spain  with all the Gold and Goods he should obtain by Robbery and bring Home were they never so great  Then the King by Sir  Ralph Winwood  got both a solemn Protestation from  Ralegh  that he had no other Intention but only to go to those Gold Mines and also a close Letter to his Majesty as it is here in his Declaration justly call'd confirming the same  This close Letter was both written close to the Purpose or in such expressive Terms as to have laid open the whole Scheme of  Ralegh  's Voyage and also as a Matter to be kept close or with the utmost Privacy for 'tis said that upon such Communication his Majesty promised  on the Word of a King to keep it secret  And it would have prevented all Supposition of Disingenuity if this close Letter had been fairly exhibited in that Declaration had it been when this was penn'd in the King's Possession as it ought according to his Royal Promise On the contrary this seems to have been the very Letter by which through the  Spanish  Ambassador's Means his Master the King of  Spain  was preadmonish'd of  Ralegh  's whole Enterprize and had sent to  Guiana  before he left the  British  Channel to prepare a greater Force than his to oppose him as will hereafter appear Nay 'tis visible by what immediately follows in the said Declaration both that this close Letter how closely soever the Contents of it are withheld did reveal the Particulars of  Ralegh  's naval Strength and that the King did divulge it to the  Spanish  Ambassador because it was so far from making him recede from his former Jealousy that he is discover'd to have objected thereupon against the Number of Ships  Ralegh  had prepared for the said Voyage to which  Ralegh  then doubtless made as proper Answer as we shall find he did hereafter But in short such a Proposal by one carrying the Reputation of such an active witty and valiant Gentleman especially of so great a Commander at Sea as his Enemies allow he had one who must be thought most wary above all others of incurring King  James  's Displeasure under which he had so long suffer'd one who had given such publick Attestations of his Sincerity  in the Prosecution of this Proposal and one who as the greatest Proof he could give thereof was actually embarking his whole Fortune as well as Credit together with those of his Friends and Relations all finding Security for their good Behaviour without any Charge to the Crown if they fail'd and with Prospect of great Advantage if they succeeded was so far from being overthrown by any Remonstrances of the Ambassador himself or from being thought a most noble and generous Overture by all other Men that even the King's Honour is acknowledged in his own Declaration to have been engag'd  not to deny his People the Adventure and Hope of so great Riches  And yet what Character of that King's Honour towards his People is exposed in the same Leaf of that very Declaration where it is pretended that  in his own Princely Judgment he gave no Belief to it  as being persuaded that in Nature there were no such Mines entire or that the  Spaniards  so industrious in the Chace of Treasure would have so long neglected the same is left to the Reader's Distinction But it may be best discover'd by the Care taken to secure his Majesty's Dividend so clearly and to express many other Articles so doubtfully in the Commission itself of which we shall now give an impartial Abstract whether it was from a magnanimous Principle or a mercenary one from upright Policy or downright Prevarication that the same was granted being as fo  lows  JAMES by the Grace of God c To all to whom these Presents shall come c Whereas Sir  Walter Ralegh  Knight intendeth to undertake a Voyage by Sea and Shipping to the South Parts of  America  or  elsewhere  within  America  possess'd and inhabited by  heathen  and  savage  People to discover some Commodities and Merchandize profitable for the  Subjects of our Kingdoms whereof the Inhabitants make little or no Use whence may ensue by Commerce some Propagation of the Christian Faith and reformed Religion among those idolatrous People And whereas there are divers Merchants c well disposed to assist Sir  Walter Raleigh  had they Assurance to enjoy their due Share of the Profits returned Sir  Walter Raleigh  being under the Peril of the Law and whereas divers other Gentlemen his Kinsmen and Friends with several Captains and Commanders are also desirous to follow and venture their Lives with him if they might be commanded by none but himself We upon deliberate Consideration desiring the Benefit of our  Subjects  also to give our princely Furtherance to the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  and his Friends as well as to encourage others in the like  laudable Enterprises  advance the Conversion of Savages and encrease Traffic by our Subjects of this Kingdom have of our special Grace c granted Sir  Walter Raleigh  full Power to carry for the said Voyage so many of our Subjects or others who will become our Subjects as shall willingly accompany him with sufficient Shipping Armour Weapons Ordnance Munition Powder Shot c and all other Things as he shall think necessary for the Use and Defence of him and his Company besides Liberty to exchange or otherwise dispose of his Goods or Merchandize also to return into this or other of our Dominions with such Gold Silver Bullion or any other Wares and they to be converted to the proper Use of the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  and his Company paying to us our Heirs c the full fifth Part of all such Gold and Silver Bullion and Ore of Gold or Silver Pearl or precious Stones as shall be so imported with all such Customs c as shall be due for any other Goods whatever Further to encourage Sir  Walter Ralegh  and the Adventurers  we promise  in verbo Regio  that no Gold Silver or other Wares by them imported from those Parts so possess'd and inhabited shall be seiz'd by us our Heirs or any of our Officers but that it shall remain the fifth Part of the said Gold Silver Bullion c as before with all other Customs and Duties being truly paid to the sole Use of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and his Company Further of our most special Grace c we constitute the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  to be the sole Governor and Commander of all Persons who shall travel or be with him in the said Voyage or in their Return And give him full Power to correct punish pardon and rule them according to such Orders and Instructions as the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  shall establish as well in Cases capital and criminal as civil both marine and other so that the said Proceedings as near as conveniently as may be are agreeable to the Laws of this Realm and to the Christian Faith now profess'd in the Church of  England  And because in such Enterprizes great Inconveniences have grown by Mutinies and Disorders for Want of sufficient Authority we give full Power to Sir  Walter Ralegh  in Case of Rebellion or Mutiny by Sea or Land to exercise martial Law upon just and apparent Necessity in as ample a Manner as our LieutenantGeneral by Sea or Land or our Lieutenants in the Counties of  England  And we give Sir  Walter Ralegh  full Power to appoint such Captains and other Commanders and Ministers under him as shall be requisite for the better ordering and governing his Company We further command the Wardens of the  Cinque Ports  Customers and other Officers quietly to permit Sir  Walter Ralegh  and all who shall adventure with him to pass to the said  South  or other Parts of  America  possess'd and inhabited as aforesaid and to return with any Goods whatever and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same to the only Use  of him and his Company paying the fifth Part of all Gold Silver Bullion c as before imported and other Customs and Duties aforesaid And these Presents c shall be to the said Wardens c sufficient Warrant And we grant to the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  that these our Letters Patents or the Inrollment thereof with all the Grants Clauses c therein shall be sufficient and effectual in Law any Law Statute c notwithstanding Witness ourselves the    th Day of  August  in the    th Year of our Reign of  England France  and  Ireland  and of  Scotland  the    th  Per breve de privato sigillo  This Abstract is made from the said Commission as it is printed in King  James  's Declaration and may agree with that which seems also to have been given us from the Records Whether there was originally any Preamble to it we cannot say But there are Authors who affirm that in this Commission King  James  called him his Trusty and Well beloved Sir  Walter Ralegh  Tho' these may be Words of Course in such like Instruments yet if some Words were thus taken out in that Recital aforesaid it might give Reason of inferring that by the same Liberty others have been squeez'd in Yet even as it is suffer'd there to appear 'tis surely far from being so clearly penn'd in point of those Limitations it is said in his Majesty's Declaration he promis'd the  Spanish  Ambassador For here is no Limitation to any Part of  America  not only the  South  Parts but elsewhere being authoriz'd and all that are habitable inhabited in some Degree or other by Heathen and Savage People So vague so equivocal and disputable is that Distinction Not one Word of  Guiana  no owning of his own Right or the Power he had lately given to plant there no Privilege for working any Mine there nor Prohibition to meddle with the King of  Spain  's  Subjects there or elfewhere as another Writer has well observ'd On the contrary full Liberty to carry what Arms and Ammunition they pleas'd for Defence if they should need it and lastly the Royal Assurance of enjoying unmolested whatever they returned with In short this Commission must easily be observed to have been penn'd how clearly soever pretended as if King  James  did neither know of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Intention for and at  Guiana  tho' a little before he had the whole Particulars thereof from  Ralegh  's own Hand or that there were any  Spaniards  planted there tho' he appears to have known that also from the  Spanish  Ambassador himself whose own Kinsman as we shall hear was sent during  Ralegh  's Restraint from  Spain  to build and colonize upon that very Spot to which  Ralegh  had now this unlimited Commission as we may rather term it to go For 'tis so much the Reverse of that close penn'd Letter wherein  Ralegh  had so expressively and so unreservedly placed his whole Trust of this Voyage in King  James  that it seems contriv'd both to hoodwink the  Spaniard  till the Action was over tho' the King betray'd it himself and to secure Loopholes sufficient for the Royal Authority against his Exceptions but they proved so large that it was thought expedient in the End as we shall find that the Commission should not be insisted on to limit or restrain any body  Whether this indistinct Power in that Commission made  Ralegh  more or less importunate for his Pardon we cannot say Some indeed write that he laboured mainly to obtain it but they are led into that Belief by the Declaration aforesaid Whereas we find it expresly asserted in a Letter of  Carew Ralegh  's that his Father had Overtures made him of procuring his Pardon for  l  by  Sir  William St John  one of the Persons of whom he purchas'd his Freedom therefore one whose Interest was the less to be doubted in this Particular but that Sir  Walter Ralegh  conferring a little before his Departure from  England  with Sir  Francis Bacon  newly made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and not long after Lord Chancellor upon this pecuniary Pardon he positively advised  Ralegh  against it in these Words  Sir the Kneetimber of your Voyage is Money spare your Purse in this Particular for upon my Life you have a sufficient Pardon for all that is pass'd already the King having under his Broad Seal made you Admiral of your Fleet and given you Power of the Martial Law over your Officers and Soldiers  But we are elsewhere told that even for less than half that Money beforemention'd that is to say  for    l the said Sir  William St John  and also Sir  Edward Villiers  before spoken of offer'd Sir  Walter Ralegh  not only his full Pardon but Liberty not to go his Voyage if he pleas'd and that he refus'd both the rather because he was told by Sir  Francis Bacon  as above that his said Commission was as good as a Pardon for all former Offences as the Law of  England  could afford him  And now near seven Months after the Date of his Commission began his Fleet to appear or rather that Part of it which lay in the  Thames  and consisted of seven Sail From the  Survey  which was taken thereof by the Appointment of  Charles  Earl of  Nottingham  the Lord Admiral on the th of  March  in the Year last named it appears that the first of them or Admiral a brave Ship as described by one who might probably have seen it and built by  Ralegh  himself was named the  Destiny  of Tons and Pieces or more of Ordnance Sir  Walter Ralegh  General and his  Son  Walter  Captain Besides two hundred Men whereof fourscore were GentlemenVolunteers and Adventures most of them Sir  Walter  's Relations which Number was afterwards increas'd Second The  Jason  of  London  Tons and Pieces of Ordnance Captain  John Pennington  ViceAdmiral fourscore Men one Gentleman and no more Third The  Encounter  Tons Pieces of Ordnance  Edward Hastings  Captain no Men more except the Master mentioned but he dying in the  Indies  was succeeeded in the Command by Capt  Whitney Fourth  The  Thunder  Tons Pieces of Ordnance Sir  Warham Sentleger  Captain six Gentlemen sixty Soldiers ten Landmen Fifth The  Flying Joan  Tons Pieces of Ordnance  John Chidley  Captain twentyfive Men Sixth The  Southampton  Tons six Pieces of Ordnance  John Bayley  Captain twentyfive Mariners two Gentlemen Seventh The  Page  a Pinnace Tons three Rabnets of Brass  James Barker  Captain eight Sailors But before  Ralegh  left the Coast of  England  he was joined by as many Ships more so that his whole Fleet consisted of thirteen Sail besides his own Ship And tho' we cannot be so particular in the remaining Part we may yet learn thus much of it that one Ship named the  Convertine  was commanded by Capt  Keymis  another called the  Confidence  was under the Charge of Capt  Woolaston  there was a Shallop named the  Flying Hart  under Sir  John Ferne  two Flyboats under Capt  Sam King  and Capt  Robert Smith  and a Carvel with perhaps another named the  Chudleigh  besides  With the former Part of the Fleet  Ralegh  set sail from the  Thames  on the th of  March  aforesaid which was in the Year and was soon after ready to proceed at the  Isle of Wight  when  several little Accidents fell out to retard his Progress for he stay'd there some Days for Sir  Warham Sentleger  whose Ship the  Thunder  by the Negligence of her Master was at Lee in the  Thames  Also after  Ralegh  was got to  Plymouth  Capt  Pennington  was not come to the  Isle of Wight  and when he did arrive was forced to ride back to  London  to engage the Lady  Ralegh  to pass her Word for the Money which was to redeem the Bread for his Ship amounting to thirty Pounds without which he could not have gone forward nor could Sir  John Ferne  proceed till  Ralegh  had supply'd him with a hundred Pounds by his Cousin  Herbert  and procur'd him another hundred Pounds of his Friend Dr  Sutcliffe  Dean of  Exeter  having furnish'd himself with a third hundred before he came from  Wales Ralegh  tarried also for Capt  Whitney  who had a third Part of his Victuals to provide and to assist him  Ralegh  generously sold his Plate at  Plymouth  notwithstanding which and  Ralegh  's having given him more Countenance than any other of his Officers  Whitney  ran away from him at the  Granadoes  and drew Capt  Woolaston  with his Ship after him  Ralegh  had further the Patience to wait ten or twelve Days for Captain  Bayley  which he afterwards ungratefully requited by deserting also the Fleet at the  Canaries  for no apparent Reason but  Ralegh  's refusing him a  French  Shallop he took in the Bay of  Portugal  and yet after  Ralegh  had bought her for fifty Crowns that the  French  might have no Cause of Complaint  Bayley  might have had her if he had desired it  For these Reasons he was forced to linger some Months at  Plymouth  losing thereby a fair Wind and indeed the Season of the Year The meanwhile he published in  May  following such Orders throughout his Fleet as gained him great Applause  for the Regularity and Instruction they establish'd therein A Gentleman of his Company in a Tract he wrote of this Voyage having express'd  how many Ways Sir  Walter Ralegh  was moved to Enterprizes of this Nature more than any other  Englishman  whatsoever by his Wisdom and Learning Variety of Conference and Experience of Places he had formerly held also how much greater his noble Ends have been than any Man's whatsoever of our Nation who had attempted the like Courses  he proceeds  to the particular Government of his Fleet which tho' others  says he  have in some Measure observed yet in all the great Volumes which have been written touching Voyages there is no Precedent of so godly severe and martial Government fit to be engraved in every Man's Soul that covets to do Honour to his King and Country in the like Attempts  Then exhibits  a Copy of the said Laws Articles and Commandments which we at this present  says he  observe  and of which it may not therefore be unacceptable hereunder to present the Heads  Bearing this Title  Orders to be observ'd by the Commanders of the Fleet and Land Companies under the Charge and Conduct of Sir  Walter Ralegh  Knight bound for the  South  Parts of  America  or elsewhere Given at  Plymouth  in  Devon May They first enjoin That Divine Service should be read Morning and Evening or if interrupted by foul Weather once a Day That all Swearing and

Vert  Upon discovering any Sail at Sea either to windward or leeward of the Admiral which he cannot discern if she be large and single▪ to strike main Topsail and hoise it again so often as they judge it to be Tons B  rthen as if to strike and hoise twice c Upon discovering a small Ship to do the like with Foretopsail but if many great Ships appear both to strike the maintop Sail often and hang out the Ensign in the Maintop If they go large before Wind to stand as they do till it may be judg'd the Admiral had seen the said Signs and Standing But if you went large at the Discovery to hale the Sheets after a while then go large again so if they have their Tacks aboard and you yours aboard at the Discovery bear up a little and hale your Sheet off again to shew us what Course they hold If you discover a Sail by Night to windward of you and you windward of the Admiral bear up to acquaint us If you think you might speak with her keep aloof and fire a Piece to give us Knowledge None to fire any Ordnance but in discovering a Sail by Night in Danger of Enemies Fire or sinking If you fire by Day we shall know 'tis to make a Ship strike if by Night we shall know you see more Sail than your own if you think we hear not in a Quarter of an Hour fire again If you are in present Danger by a Leak▪ shoot two Pieces soon after one another if by Fire three in like Manner In foul Weather every

Every Ship under Lee of the Enemy must labour to recover the Wind if the Admiral endeavour it or if the Enemy be to Leeward the whole Fleet to follow the Admiral or other leading Ship within Musketshot of the Enemy giving so much Liberty to the leading Ship after her Broadside deliver'd and her Sail trimm'd Then the second Ship to give her Side so the third and fourth all taking as the

be established by general Consent when they should arrive there A Flag on the Mizen Shrouds of the Admiral was to be the Signal for summoning the Officers to Council See a Tract call'd  News of Sir  Walter Ralegh c  to  from Page to  It was the End of  June  or the Beginning of  July  before all his Company join'd him and he  sail'd from  Plymouth  then being encounter'd with a violent Storm fome eight Leagues to the West of  Scilly  in which Capt  Chidley  's Pinnace was sunk and Capt  King  driven into  Bristol Ralegh  held it from Experience as well as Reason the Office of a Commander of many Ships and those of different Sailings and Conditions rather to take a Port and keep his Fleet together than to endanger the Loss of his Masts and Rigging or the Advantage which Enemies might take or the Loss of more Time in attending another Rendezvous by the Danger of a Separation Therefore he put into  Ireland  and was obliged to stay seven Weeks there so that the Winds only were to be accused now as he observes for their Delay And here tho' by his Credit he procured fifty Oxen which he distributed among his Fleet some of the Crew spared not at his Return to defame him with having taken Care to revictual himself and none of the rest On the th of  August  he set forward from  Cork  When he arriv'd at the Isle of  Lancerota  on the th of  September Ralegh  sent a Request to the Governor that he might be admitted to treat for some Provisions The Governor sent back Word that he would confer with  Ralegh  himself if he would come attended but by one Gentleman and armed only with their Rapiers  Ralegh  taking with him Lieutenant  Bradshaw  met the Governor who  agreed that if he would send up an  English  Factor whose Ship then rode in the Road whatever the Island afforded should be deliver'd at a reasonable Rate  Ralegh  sent the Factor but the Governor procrastinated and at last sent Word that unless he would embark his Men which lay on the Sea Shore the Islanders were so jealous they durst not divide from one another to supply him  Ralegh  comply'd but when half his Men were got aboard the Islanders began to offer Violence upon the rest They slew one and sent the Factor to tell  Ralegh  they would part with nothing to him for that they believed his Company to be the  Turkish  Fleet which had lately destroy'd  Puerto Sancto  The  English  hereupon would have gone and helped themselves but  Ralegh  considering what Displeasure it might give at home how the Merchants might suffer and the poor  English  Factor be ruin'd complained to the Governor of the  Grand Canaries  of whom he also desired Leave to take Water undisturb'd but instead of Answer when he landed some hundred Men in the Desart Part of the Island where they found fresh Water there Ambush was laid by which one of his Men was wounded to Death and more had been slain had not Captain  Thornhust  and Lieutenant  Hayman  two valiant Gentlemen seconded by Sir  Warham Sentleger  and young Captain  Ralegh  with half a dozen more made forty of them run away From this unavoidable Fray  Bayley  found Pretence to turn Tail and go home again  In Want of Water they sail'd to  Gomera  one of the strongest and best defended of all these Islands and the best Port The  Spaniards  being seated upon the very Wash of the Sea roughly saluted the Fleet at its first Entrance with their Cannon and the  English  returned their Salutation But as  soon as  Ralegh  recover'd the Harbour and commanded there should be no more firing he sent a  Spaniard  he had with him ashore to assure the Governor he had no Intention to make War with any of the  Spanish  King's Subjects and if any Harm had been done by his great Ordnance to the Town it was their Fault who by shooting first gave the Occasion The Governor answer'd he thought they had been the  Turkish  Fleet aforesaid but having been certified they were Christians and  Englishmen  and sought nothing but Water he was willing to let them take what they pleas'd if he might be assur'd they would make no Attempt upon the Town Houses or their Gardens and Fruits  Ralegh  reply'd that he would give him his Faith and the Word of the King of  Great Britain  his Sovereign that if the People of the Town or Island should lose so much as an Orange or a Grape by any of his Men without paying for it he would hang him up in the Marketplace And  Ralegh  kept his Men in such good Discipline that the Governor in divers Letters for he wrote to him every Day acknowledg'd how punctually  Ralegh  kept his Faith with him in Regard to the inoffensive Behaviour of his Company and also how much himself was beholden to him for his particular Civilities For his Countess who was of  English  Extract being a  Stafford  by the Mother's Side and of the House of  Horne  by the Father having sent  Ralegh  some Presents of Fruit Sugar and Rusk he return'd others of greater Value  Tho' the Presents  Ralegh  return'd to this Governor's Lady are not mentioned in his  Apology  whence his Progress hitherto is chiefly extracted I find in his own Journal aforesaid of this Voyage that they consisted of an Extract of Amber Ambergreese a fine cutwork Ruff a very excellent Picture of  Mary Magdalen  and a good Quantity of RoseWater which was of great Value and Esteem in these Parts  The Earl moreover gave him at his Departure on the st of  September  a Letter to  Don Diego Sarmiento  the  Spanish  Ambassador in  England  testifying how honourably  Ralegh  had comported himself to the  Morisco's  in these  Canary Islands  during the fourteeen Days that he was among them Before he set Sail he discharg'd a Bark of the  Grand Canaries  taken by one of his Pinnaces coming from  Cape Blanc  in  Africa  who complaining that his Men had eaten of their Fish to the Value of six Ducats  Ralegh  gave them eight  After having weather'd through a violent Hurricane and some vast Showers of Rain besides Dangers no less fearful within Sickness now beginning to visit his Ship he arriv'd on the d of  October  at the Isle of  Bravo  And here underwent great Hazards and Hardships beside the Sickness daily spreading among his Men For whereas all those who navigated even between  Cape de Vert  and  America  were wont to pass between fifteen and twenty Days at most he found the Wind so contrary to him and indeed to Nature so many Storms and Showers that he spent near six Weeks in the Passage from hence by reason whereof and the burning Heat of the Climate he was in great Distress for Water Here losing Anchors Cables and Watercask besides two more of his Company he was driven after two Days by a Kind of  Turnado  from this Island which as well as the others he touch'd at before mention'd he has well describ'd in his Journal of this unfortunate Voyage After his Return home Detraction did not spare to give out that he went to  Cape de Vert  knowing it to be infected and thereby loft many of his Men whereas he was Leagues from that  Cape  according to his own Account in his Apology and had threescore Men ill in his own  Ship before he came to  Bravo  as we find it in his Journal tho' if he had gone to that  Cape  now after the Rains which had fallen there had been little Danger of any such Infection All Places that lie near great Rivers in low and moorish Grounds do indeed as he rightly observes subject their Inhabitants to Fevers and Agues as even along both Sides of our own River  Thames  and other Infection is not found either in the  Indies  or in  Africa  except when the easterly Wind or Breezes are excluded and kept off by some high Mountains from the Valleys whereby the Air wanting Motion stagnates and becomes exceedingly unhealthful as at  Nombre de Dios  and some other Places But says he  as good Success admits of no Examination so the contrary allows of no Excuse  Hence they proceeded on the th of  October  towards  Guiana  But the Sickness revisited and destroy'd many of those whom the Storms spared carrying off Numbers of his ablest Men both for Sea and Land no less than fortytwo of his own Ship ending their Voyage with their Lives mostly in this Month at least before they reach'd the Coast About the th of the same Month when their Sickness began to be at the Height and they at the greatest Distance from any Shore they were many other Ways also distress'd for when they began to be in Scarcity of Water they were also becalm'd yet ever threatned with Extremity of tempestuous Weather from the strange and unusual Alterations in the Atmosphere One while the Horizon muffled as it were in such thick and fearful Darkness that they were forced to steer a Day or two by Candlelight At other Times arched and overshot with gloomy Discolorations so that watery Rainbows were continually invading their  Eyes or heavy Showers their Bodies and dead Calms retarding their Ships Afterwards at  Trinidad Ralegh  observ'd besides two Watergalls no less than fifteen Rainbows in one Day and one of them bent as it were both Ends together making a perfect Circle and these were ever followed with wet Weather for as he also noted especially of the Morning Rainbow it did not here produce a fair Day as in  England  But one good Effect ensu'd that when their Water was so scarce near the latter End of this Month that the Ship's Crew was reduced to half Allowance they saved some Hogheads which fell from the Clouds and all quenched their Thirst with great Cans of this bitter Draught as  Ralegh  describes that Rain Water to have been On the last Day of this Month as he was raised abruptly out of his Bed in a Sweat by the Noise which a sudden great Gust had occasion'd in his Ship he got a Cold which turned to a burning Fever and cast him down for twenty Days together in which Time he receiv'd no other Sustenance than a few stew'd Prunes but Drink every Hour both Day and Night and sweated so excessively that he was forced to shift three Times every Day and as often at Night At last the Violence of his Disease was abated by the Oranges and other Fruits he had received at  Gomera  of the Governor's Lady which he had carefully preserved in Sand to his great Refreshment and without which as he owns himself he could not have lived But it was double the Time before he could recover in any tollerable Degree from this sharp Visitation  In this slow and sickly Manner they arrived at last on the th of  November  at the North Cape of  Wiapoco  And here  Ralegh  sent for his old Servant  Leonard  the  Indian  who had been in  England  three or four Years with him but he was remov'd so far up in the Country there was no pursuing him Therefore he stood away for  Caliana  which is in Degrees on the Coasts of  Guiana  at the first Discovery call'd Port  Howard  where the Cassique was also his Servant and had lived with him in the  Tower  of  London  two Years There he arrived in a Day or two having passed the Island noted for its Multitude of Birds and Silkbearing Trees and from thence sent for his Servant  Harry  the  Indian  who with other Cassiques came and brought him great Store of  Cassavi  Bread and roasted Mullets with Plantanes Pinas Pistacias c But  Ralegh  ventured not to eat of the Pinas which tempted him exceedingly till after a Day or two's airing on the Shore in a Tent which was there pitch'd for him then he also eat some Armadillo and a little Pork and began to gather Strength Here also he landed his sick Men and recovered many and here he buried Captain  Edward Hastings  the Lord  Huntington  's Brother who died ten Days or more before and with him his Serjeant Major  Hart  and Captain  Henry Snedale  the Charge of whose Ship  Ralegh  gave to his Servant Captain  Robert Smith  of  Cornwall  Here he also set up his Barges and Shallops which they brought from  England  in Quarters cleansed his Ships trim'd up his Casks and supply'd them with Water fix'd up a Forge and made such Iron Works as they wanted Thus on that Shore and this River they employed and refresh'd themselves for about three Weeks during which Time  Ralegh  was very much caress'd by the  Indians  of his old Acquaintance aforesaid and the other Natives of this Place who cherished him daily with the best Provisions that the Country yielded and offer'd him all Kind of Obedience even to the making him their Sovereign  Prince and Ruler if he would abide and settle among them so fresh continued his Memory and such unanimous Impressions of Homage and Respect had his former Behaviour still left upon them which Offer he mentions with the greatest Modesty and Indifference in the Dispatch he now sent to  England  For in this Interval Captain  Peter Alley  one of his Company who was much troubled with a vertiginous Disorder in his Head having got Leave to return home and the Opportunity of a  Dutch  Vessel which lay there  Ralegh  among other Letters sent one by him to his Lady dated from  Caliana  the th of  November Herein  says he  I cannot write to you but with a weak Hand for I have suffered the most violent Calenture for fifteen Days that ever Man did and lived but God that gave me a strong Heart in all my Adversities has also now strengthned me in the Hellfire of Heat We had two most grievous Sicknesses in our Ship of which fortytwo have died and there are yet many sick but having recover'd the Land of  Guiana  this    th of  November  I hope we shall recover them We are yet two hundred Men and the rest of our Fleet are reasonably strong strong enough I hope to perform what we have undertaken if the diligent Care at  London  to make our Strength known to the  Spanish  King by his Ambassador has not taught the  Spanish  King to fortify all the Entrances against us Howsoever we must make the Adventure and if we perish it shall be no Honour for  England  nor Gain for his Majesty to lose among many others an hundred as valiant Gentlemen as  England  hath in it  Then having spoken of  Bayley  's running away from him the unnatural Weather they had labour'd through and their tedious Passage with the Present of Fruits which had so much relieved him as is before observed besides the Death of  some principal Officers and Recommendation of himself to some Friends in  London  especially his Son  Carew  he concludes thus  To tell you that I might be here King of the  Indians  were a Vanity but my Name hath still liv'd among them here they feed me with fresh Meat and all that the Country yields All offer to obey me  At this Time also a Gentleman of his Company having drawn up a Discourse in Praise of  Guiana  and in Honour of this Adventure especially of the principal Discoverer  Ralegh  himself it being dated from  Caliana November  the th sent it also into  England  by the same Bearer and it was printed the following Year  On the th of  December  they left this River and came next Day to the  Triangle Islands  but were all in Danger of leaving their Bones upon the Sholes before they got thither For they were laid aground especially  Ralegh  's larger Ship for the Space of twentyfour Hours or more and had it not been fair Weather would never have got off the Coast having not above two Fathom of Water Here after a few Days when all the Fleet was gather'd together it being consider'd in a general Consultation that  Rolegh  himself who had grappled with the Sickness for six Weeks and was now rather so much relaps'd than recover'd that he could not move otherwise than as he was carried in a Chair they resolved that there was no Thoughts of his undertaking the Passage up the  Orenoque  in Person And further though they could never understand by  Keymis  who was the first of any Nation that had entered the main Mouth of that River nor by any of their Mariners who had traded there many Years for Tobacco what Certainty the Water was of yet having found by Experience that Ships at eleven Foot Water lay aground  three Days in passing up therefore there was no attempting it with  Ralegh  's Ship which being heavier and charged with near forty Pieces of Ordnance drew seventeen Foot Nor would his Son with the rest have ventured with the Provisions they had through any other Person's Assurance or Resolution of staying to relieve them at a Place appointed against the Forces expected to approach but that of his Father and their General So it was resolved by all that the five larger Ships should ride at  Punta de Gallo  in  Trinidad  under  Ralegh  to secure their Retreat and the five lesser for this was now the whole Number of his Fleet with five or six Foot Companies of fifty Men each should enter the River According to this Determination the Fleet was here divided that is to say Captain  Whitney  in the  Encounter Woolaston  in the  Confidence King  in the  Supply Smith  in a Pink and  Hall  in a Carvel The Companies had for their Leaders Captain  Charles Parker  and Captain  North  Brothers to the Lord  Mounteagle  and the Lord  North  young  Ralegh  Captain  Thornhurst  of  Kent  Captain  Pennington  's Lieutenant who seems to be another  Hall  and Captain  Chidley  's Lieutenant  Prideux  Sir  Warham St Leger Ralegh  's Lieutenant who had the Charge of these Companies fell sick at  Caliana  so it was confer'd on  George Ralegh  Sir  Walter  's Nephew who had served with great Commendation in the  Low Countries  and Captain  Keymis  had the chief Charge for their Guidance and landing within the River But  Keymis  having laid down the Plan of his intended Attempt upon the Mine and undertaken to discover it with six or eight Persons in Sir  John Ferne  's Shallop  Ralegh  upon Consideration disliking that Method of Procedure  determined to alter it and therefore gave him his Instructions in the following Words  Keymis  Whereas you were resolv'd after your Arrival into the  Oronoque  to pass to the Mine with my Cousin  Herbert  and six Musketiers and to that End desired to have Sir  John Ferne  's Shallop I do not allow of that Course because you cannot land so secretly but that some  Indians  on the River side may discover you who giving Knowledge thereof to the  Spaniard  you may be cut off before you recover your Boat I therefore advise you to suffer the Captains and Companies of the  English  to pass up westward of the Mountain  Aio  from whence you have no less than three Miles to the Mine and to encamp between the  Spanish  Town and you if there is any Town near it that being so secured you may make Trial what Depth and Breadth the Mine holds and whether or no it will answer our Hopes And if you find it royal and the  Spaniards  begin to war upon you then let the Serjeantmajor repel them if it is in his Power and drive them as far as he can but if you find the Mine is not so rich as to persuade the holding of it and it requires a second Supply then shall you bring but a Basket or two to satisfy his Majesty that my Design was not imaginary but true though not answerable to his Majesty's Expectation for the Quantity of which I never gave Assurance nor could On the other Side if you shall find any great Number of Soldiers are newly sent into the  Orenoque  as the Cassique of  Caliana  told us there were and that the Passages are already enforc'd so as without manifest Peril of my Son yourself and the other Captains you cannot pass towards the Mine then be well advised how you land for I know that a few Gentlemen excepted what a Scum of Men you have and I would not for all the World receive a Blow from the  Spaniard  to the Dishonour of the Nation  I myself for my Weakness cannot be present neither will the Company land except I abide by the Ships the Galleons of  Spain  being daily expected  Piggot  the Serjeant major is dead Sir  Warham St Leger  my Lieutenant without Hope of Life and my Nephew  George Ralegh  your Serjeantmajor now but a young Man it is therefore on your Judgment that I rely who I trust God will direct for the best Let me hear from you as soon as you can You shall find me at  Punta de Gallo  dead or alive and if you find not my Ships there yet there you shall find their Ashes for I will fire with the Galleons if it come to Extremity but run away I will never  With these Instructions those five Ships set forward parting from  Ralegh  and the rest of the Fleet at the Islands aforesaid with a Month's Provision on the th of  December  But when they found a new  Spanish  Town called  St Thome  consisting of about Houses though lightly built with a Chapel a Convent of  Franciscans  and a Garrison erected on the main Channel of the  Orenoque  about Twenty Miles distant from the Place where  Antonio Berreo  the Governor taken by  Ralegh  in his first Discovery and Conquest here attempted to plant  Keymis  and the rest thought themselves oblig'd through Fear of leaving the Enemy's Garrison between them and their Boats to deviate from their Instructions which enjoin'd them first to carry a little Party to make Trial of the Mine under a Shelter of their own Camp and then to deal with the  Spanish  Town as it should give Cause by permitting or offering to prevent them So they concluded to land in one Body and encamp between the Mine and the Town whereby though themselves were something stronger their Boats were subject to the same Exposure  and the Mine left untry'd contrary to  Ralegh  's Order For about three Weeks after their Departure landing by Night it seems nearer the Town than they suspected and meaning to rest themselves on the Riverside till morning they were in the Nighttime set upon by the  Spanish  Troops appriz'd of and forearm'd for their coming as we shall see This Charge was so unexpected and struck the common Soldiers with such Amazement and Confusion that had not the Captains and some other valiant Gentlemen made head and animated the rest they had all been cut to pieces But the rest by their Example soon rallying made such a vigorous Defence against the  Spaniards  that they drove them to a Retreat till in the Warmth of their Pursuit the  English  found themselves at the  Spanish  Town before they knew where they were Here the Battle was renewed afresh upon them being assaulted by the Governor himself  Don Diego Palameca  and four or five Captains at the Head of their Companies against whom Captain  Walter Ralegh  a brave and sprightly young Man now twentythree Years of Age but fonder of Glory than Safety not tarrying for the Musketiers rush'd foremost at the Head of a Company of Pikes and having killed one of the  Spanish  Captains was himself shot by another but pressing still forward with his Sword upon  Erinetta  probably the Captain who had shot him this  Spaniard  with the Buttend of his Musket fell'd him to the Ground and after these Words  'Tis said in King  James  's Declaration p that young  Ralegh  likeliest to know his Father's Secret when he led his Soldiers upon this Town us'd these or the like Words  Come on my Hearts here is the Mine that we must expect they that look for any other Mine are Fools  As if  Ralegh  was at so much Toil Hazard and Expence only to break the Peace and drive a Pack of poor  Spaniards  out of a worthless Town Nor does it seem likely that if young  Ralegh  knew this to be his Father's Secret that he would thus disclose it but rather if he did utter such an Expression that he suddenly invented it to give his Men Hopes of Booty knowing that would best excite them to Bravery  Lord have mercy upon me and prosper  your Enterprize  young  Ralegh  spoke no more Hereupon  John Plessington  his Serjeant thrust the said  Spanish  Captain through the Body with his Halbert Two Commanders more of the  Spaniards  were at the same Time slain one by  John of Morocco  another of young  Ralegh  's Company And lastly the Governor himself also lost his Life in the said Engagement which happened as  Camden  reckons the second of  January  The Leaders being thus all dispatch'd and many of their Soldiers the rest fled and were dispers'd some to shelter about the Market place from whence they kill'd and wounded the  English  at Pleasure so as they saw no Way left to be safe but by firing the Town about their Ears and driving them to the Woods and Mountains whence they still kept the  English  waking with perpetual Alarms Others were more careful to defend the Passages to their Mines of which they had three or four not far distant than they had been to defend the Town itself But for the Magazine of Tobacco which one Writer among other erroneous Representations of this Voyage thought might countervail the Charge of it could it with some other Things have been preserved it seems not to have been consumed by the  English  because  Ralegh  had enough thereof soon after to have paid for the victualling of his Fleet if there had been Occasion as himself has related  All Obstructions seeming thus removed Capt  Keymis  had now a fair Opportunity to make what Trial he pleas'd at the Mine and that he did attempt the Discovery will appear by the Consequence as his Preparations do in the Letter he wrote to  Ralegh  six Days after the Action aforesaid tho' it came not long after to his Hands Herein having open'd in as gradual and discreet a Manner as he could how gallantly his Son fell in this Exploit and observed that if  his extraordinary Valour and Vigour of Mind had not led them all on it had never been attempted nor performed as it was to his surviving Honour  having also observ'd  that four of the best Houses in Town belonged to Refiners tho' he had seen no Coin or Bullion but only a little Plate  he adds  Now I propose God willing to visit the Mine not eight Miles from the Town sooner I could not go by Reason of the Murmurings the Discords and Vexations wherewith the SerjeantMajor is perpetually tormented  Concluding with these Words  I have sent your Lordship a Parcel of scatter'd Papers and reserve a Cartload one Roll of Tobacco one Tortoise with some Oranges and Lemons praying God to give you Strength and Health of Body and a Mind armed against all Extremities I rest ever to be commanded this    th of  January  your Lordship's  Keymis  Indeed  Ralegh  had need of those Prayers on his own Part at this Time not only in his Sickness but even in the Intervals he had of Recovery for here to give some Account of him in this Time of Separation we may observe that he lay with the five larger Ships under himself Capt  John Pennington  his ViceAdmiral one of the most sufficient Gentlemen for the Sea that  England  has says he Sir  Warham St Leger  another  valiant and worthy Gentleman Sir  John Ferne  and Captain  Chidley  of  Devon  mostly at  Punta de Gallo  and other Ports about  Trinidad  no less than a hundred and fifty Miles from the rest of his Fleet making the Adventure up the  Oronoque  yet in daily Apprehensions of meeting with the  Spanish Armada  sent purposely to lay wait for and destroy him which it would probably have done after the great Sickness which had so much weakned his Men and under this disadvantageous Division of his Ships but that the Enemy luckily waited for him in a wrong Place Besides it having been falsly rumour'd in his Fleet that he brought out of  England  twentytwo thousand Broadpieces of Gold with him some of his Crew traiterously conspir'd to sail away while he was gone ashore in his Barge to take Views and make Discoveries of the Country which he was sometimes wont to do as at  Terra de Brea  or the  Pitchland  as he calls it from the bitumenous Substance which so remarkably issues there as he has well describ'd and when he travers'd some Woods to seek the Trees that yield that precious Balsam whereof he got a small Quantity which smelt like Angelica so to have left him a Prey to Famine wild Beasts or the no less unmerciful  Spaniards  by whom he might have been flea'd alive as other  Englishmen  who came but to traffick had formerly been Add to this the many Provocations he received from the  Spaniards  who were in any of the Ports where his Men landed only to exchange a few Commodities for Tobacco or other Products of the Country not only by the most opprobrious Language but discharging sometimes a Volley of twenty Muskets at a Time upon them whereby Sir  John Ferne  had some of his Men kill'd And lastly the Uneasiness he was continually in that he could hear no  Tidings of the rest of his Fleet thus detach'd upon the Adventure And tho' some  Indian  Spies were brought to him in the Beginning of  February  by one of whom who could speak the  Spanish  Tongue he was first informed that the  English  in  Orenoque  were reported by some  Tivitivas  he had spoken with to have taken  St Thome  and slain  Diego de Palameca  the Governor with Captain  Erinetta  and Captain  John Rues  that the rest fied and that two  English  Captains were likewise kill'd Tho' the same was soon after also asserted with other Particulars by another  Indian  yet  Ralegh  would not set them down till he knew the Truth which afterwards endeavouring to compass of other  Indians  said to have been at the Taking of that Town whom he sent in Pursuit of they escaped and he was not certified in the Report even near the middle of this Month for so far his own Journal extends  In the mean while  Keymis  made an Attempt for the Mine and had set forward with Captain  Thornhurst  Mr  W Herbert  Sir  John Hamden  and others but at their first Approach near the Bank where they intended to land he received from an Ambuscade of  Spaniards  in the Woods who had probably gather'd there with Expectation of his coming that Way to the Mine a Volley of Shot which slew two of his Company hurt six others and wounded Captain  Thornhurst  so dangerously in the Head that he languish'd thereof three Months after This Blow first stagger'd the Resolution of  Keymis  who then as he reflected more upon the State of their Condition was more overpower'd with Doubts and Discouragements insomuch that though the  English  under him might have been informed of two or three Mines more beside this which  Keymis  had undertaken to lead them to by  a  Mulatto  who had waited on the late Governor in his Chamber and as he has written in his Letter beforemention'd knew all Things that concern'd his Master This Servant afterwards by no other Means than courteous Usage discover'd the same to  Ralegh  himself and not only the Places where those Mines lay but more particularly that two of them Gold ones were in the Possession of  Don Pedro Rodrigo de Parama  and  Hermian Frontino  and a Silver one in the Possession of  Francisco Fasardo  and that the Cause of their remaining unwrought was that they wanted Negroes to work them for by a Law of  Charles  the Emperor the  Indians  could not be constrain'd and the  Spaniards  neither would nor could endure the Labour Yet did the  English  now decline all Endeavour either to be directed to these though but few Miles distant from the Town or proceed to possess that which  Keymis  was to conduct them to though within a few Hours March Nay when the Ships were upon their Return and they had sailed down the River as far as the Country of  Carapana  one of the natural Lords who had reserved that Part of  Guiana  to the late Queen and having heard that the  English  had abandon'd  St Thome  and left no Forces as he hop'd they would have done had sent a great Canoe laden with Store of Fruits and Provisions to the Captains also by one of his Men who had learn'd the  Spanish  Tongue during his long Slavery under the  Spaniards  had offer'd them a rich Gold Mine in his own Country to engage their Stay further proffering to leave sufficient Pledge for any  English  Person they should send to examine it and when Captain  Leak  with another of the Company named  Molineux  offer'd themselves to go the greater Part nevertheless refus'd to suffer them This Declension  of his Offer so heightned  Carapana  's Desire to make it acceptable that he sent again leaving one of his Men still aboard who entreated to detain them but two Days and  Carapana  would himself aged as he was bring them a Sample of the Ore who though still rejected and the Ships under Sail yet sent once more a Boat after them up to the Mouth of the River in hopes to the very last of retrieving them as the said Captain  Leak Parker Molineux  and half a dozen Officers more are by  Ralegh  nominated to attest But the Adventurers among other Dissuasives from all Temptation to continue there any longer harbour'd a Notion that the  Spaniards  had secretly agreed with and employ'd those  Indians  only to trepan the  English  which appear'd but a weak and illgrounded Apprehension to  Ralegh  for such Treachery might have been easily prevented had they waited the Arrival of the old  Indian  Chief who would have brought the Ore to their very Ships And what Advantage in betraying them says he could there be when the  Guianians  offered to leave Hostages six for one Moreover one of the  Indians  whom the  English  found in Fetters when they took  St Thome  and brought with them aboard could have told them that the very Cassique who sent to shew them the Gold Mine in his Country was unconquer'd and at Enmity with the  Spaniard  and could have assur'd them withal that such Mines were in that Country possess'd by the said Cassique But no Intreaty or Invitation would retain them and so they return'd about the middle of  February  to  Punta de Gallo  after the Fleet had been thus divided and they absent above two Months from Sir  Walter Ralegh  as himself has informed us whereby it appears that the Fleet united at or very soon after the Time he  discontinued his Journal and it appears no where in that Journal that any inhuman Offer was made to remove from  Punta de Gallo  to the  Charibees  many Leagues off where he knew Famine must overtake the Land Soldiers before they could overtake him as his Enemies suggested besides he cleared himself in such a solemn Manner of this Aspersion at his Death as leaves not the least Stain of Cruelty any where but upon their Characters who slander'd him with it  'Tis possible that  Keymis  might at his first Return be favourably received and ss familiarly admitted to  Ralegh  's Table as before for a Disappointment of this Consequence was not to be too readily broach'd on one Side nor reprehended on the other Besides as some Mitigation of their ill Success and Inducement to further Hopes  Keymis  produced two Ingots of Gold which had been reserved at  St Thome  as the King of  Spain  's Quota or Proportion together with several other valuable Spoils of the Governor  Keymis  also brought with him a large Quantity of Papers Letters Memorials Schemes Plans and Maps found in the said Governor's Study which gave some singular Lights into the State and Condition of  Spain  with Respect to many of the  American  Plantations Among these Papers were found four Letters which plainly discover'd not only  Ralegh  's whole Enterprize to have been betray'd but his Life thereby put into the Power of the  Spaniards  themselves  The King of  Spain  's first Letter sent to  Guiana  by a Bark of  Aviso  to arm the  Indians  against  Ralegh  's Coming was dated  March  at  Madrid  which Letter says  Ralegh  in his to Sir  Ralph Winwood  I have here enclosed sent you the rest I reserve not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not▪ The second of that King's was dated d of  May  sent also by a Caravel to  Diego de Palameca  Governpr of  Guiana El Dorado  and  Trinidad  The third of his Majesty's was sent by the Bishop of  Puerto Rico  and delivered to ihat Governor the th of  July  following and the fourth was sent from the Farmer and Secretary of his Customs in the  Indies  at the same Time Thus  Ralegh  's Letter to  Winwood  from  St Christopher's  in his  Remains  last Edition p compared with some Manuscript Copies of it in the  Harleyan  Library c Others tell us these Advertisements and Preparations were the Cause of all the Resistance that was made at  St Thome  that  Ralegh  's whole Design under his own Hand was delivered by King  James  to  Gondomar  and that his own Letter thereof to King  James  was found in the Governor of  St Thome  's Closet which Letter he brought back and shewed to the Lords of the Council See  Observations on  Sanderson  's History  p Thus also in the  StateTrials  Vol I p and in Dr  Welwood  's Memoirs it is said  Ralegh  's Plan which King  James  promised to keep secret was sent by  Gondomar  to  Spain  and thence to the  Indies  before  Ralegh  left the  Thames  and the very original Paper was found in the  Spanish  Governor's Closet  and by whom even to the Breaking of that Peace if any was broken for which he was afterwards exclaim'd against  Ralegh  himself has related  Though  Ralegh  his charged this Matter of betraying him to the  Spaniards  in plain Terms both in his Letter to the Secretary of State which follows as above and in his Apology one or both of which King  James  had certainly read it is yet observable that this Topic is not so much as touch'd upon in his Majesty's Declaration but entirely sunk in Silence  for he thought this such black and cruel Usage that he forbore not in a Letter which he wrote about a Month after this Time from the Isle of St  Christopher  's to Sir  Ralph Winwood  the Secretary of State to shew his Sense of it in these Words  It pleased his Majesty to value us at so little as to command me upon my Allegiance to set down under my Hand the Country and the very River by which I was to enter it to set down the Number of my Men and Burden of my Ships and what Ordnance every Ship carried which being made known to the  Spanish  Ambassador and by him sent to the King of  Spain  a Dispatch was made and Letters  sent from  Madrid  before my Departure out of the  Thames By the Contents of those  Spanish  Letters it further appears that three hundred  Spanish  Soldiers and ten Pieces of Ordnance were commissioned to be sent from their respective Garrisons against the Adventurers up the  Orenoque  that is a hundred and fifty Men from  Nuevo Reyno de Granada  under the Command of Captain  Antonio Musica  and another hundred and fifty from  Puerto Rico  to be conducted under  Francisco Zanchio  There was also prepared an  Armada  by Sea to set upon  Ralegh  himself and the Ships with him  by which says he we had not only been torn to pieces but all those in the River had also perished they being of no force for the Sea Fight for we had resolved to have burnt by their Sides and to have died there had the  Armada  arriv'd but belike they stay'd for us at  Margarita  by which they knew we must pass towards the  Indies In another Letter which he wrote the next Day from the same Island to his Wife  Ralegh  says  Never was poor Man exposed to Slaughter as I was  Then having related the Particulars of the Forces beforemention'd sent to destroy him through the Communication of his Scheme to the Court of  Spain  by the  Spanish  Ambassador he concludes this Part with these Words  It were too long to tell you how we were preserved if I live I shall make it known  But the Indignation which  Ralegh  must have conceived at the Sight of these Letters was not a little heightned when he came to hear that  Keymis  had made no actual Trial at the Mine and the Reasons he gave for having relinquish'd it He alledg'd indeed that after the Salley of the  Spaniards  upon them from the woody Banks which had disabled several of his Men at their first Attempt to land he began to consider they had not  then able Men enough left to work the Mine though indeed it lay not so deep as to need all those Pioneers and Implements which in King  James  's Declaration  Ralegh  is objected against for not carrying with him as may appear by the first Discovery of this Mine in the former Part of these Sheets  Keymis  also argued they had not Men enough to keep this Mine though they should escape further Danger in the difficult Passage to it which he feared much they should not the  Spaniards  being more careful to preserve it as was said than the Town and the Ways to it  Aspera y Fragosa  as  Ralegh  has observed agreeable to that Infirtility and Unaptness for Cultivation which  Acosta  and other Naturalists have describ'd in those Grounds which are impregnate with such Treasures  Keymis  urged further that they wanted sufficient Provisions for the Number remaining having been much longer up the River than they expected and that they could not carry enough from the Town up the Mountain their Company being divided the greater Part in the Town itself and those too weak to defend it That he further found all Regard to Order and Obedience broke through as soon as Capt  Ralegh  was dead and feared the fatal News of his Death would either not find his sick Father alive or hasten his End that to attempt the Discovery and fail through any of these Discouragements he thought would be more detrimental than wholly at this Time to decline it that to discover it for a Pack of Profligates and Mutineers was more than they deserv'd and to discover it for  Ralegh  himself not likely to live and unpardon'd was as whisper'd in the Company for a Man  non ens  in the Law Above all that it would therefore be a greater Error to find it for the  Spaniards  than to pretend it could nowhere  be found Lastly that these Arguments approv'd of by the Majority were confirmed by the Alarm they received at the Discovery of the Letters aforesaid in the Governor's Closet whereby they were led every Moment to expect a fresh Enforcement of the Enemy against them from each End of the River therefore separate as the Fleet was and not able to make Resistance they all agreed to return  However specious these Arguments or some of them might be  Raleigh  was in no wise pacify'd with them He utterly disavowed the whole Conduct of  Keymis  before several of his Company and the Ignorance he had pretended to them told him that a blind Man might have found the Place by the Marks and Directions himself had set down under his own Hand and that his Care of losing more Men in passing the Woods was but feigned for after his Son's Death it was known he had no Care for any Man surviving and therefore had he brought Home but one hundred Weight of Ore tho' with the Loss of as many Men it would have given the King Satisfaction preserved his Reputation and encouraged a Return the next Year with greater Force to have held the Country for his Majesty to whom it belonged for the Riches and Fruitfulness whereof himself had formerly so largely attested But since he had suffered his Wilfulness in spite of his Knowledge to defeat their whole Undertaking he should indeed be glad if  Keymis  could make those Reasons for not opening the Mine passable with the State but that he himself could not justify the Neglect  Keymis  grew deeply discontented hereat and continued so several Days  Afterwards he came to me in my Cabbin  says  Ralegh and shew'd me a Letter he had written to the Earl of  Arundel  excusing himself  for not discovering of the Mine using the same Arguments and many others which he had done before and prayed me to allow thereof  But  Ralegh  no Way satisfied declared that as  Keymis  could plead no Ignorance he could admit of no Excuse being wounded in his Credit with the King past all Recovery and that this could admit of no Reparation  Keymis  seeing  Ralegh  resolved not to favour his Folly retired as one knowing not what Course to take yet expressing perhaps also some Design of giving further Satisfaction  and went out of my Cabbin into his own  says  Ralegh  where having shut himself in  Ralegh  soon after heard a Pistol go off and sending up to know who discharged it  Keymis  made Answer he fired it himself because it had been long charg'd About half an Hour after his Boy going into his Cabbin found him dead with much Blood by him having a long Knife thrust through his Left Pap into his Heart and his Pistol lying by him with which it appeared that he had shot himself but the Bullet being small and having only crack'd a Rib he dispatch'd effectually with the Knife  The Letters in the  Remains  aforesaid p And the  Apology  p  James Howel  says that Captain  Keymis  the main Instrument for the Discovery of the Mine pistol'd himself in a desperate Mood of Discontent in his Cabbin in the  Convertine  which not being  Ralegh  's Ship would remove  Keymis  's Death still further from all Surmise that he had any such foul Play done him to prevent telling of Tales as  Sanderson  and other prejudiced Writers have maliciously insinuated The  Observator  on his History of K  ng  James  calls it a b  se Aspersion and  Sanderson  in his Answer instead of producing any Authority in his own Justification is for meddling no further with it so refers to his History as a Matter too large to be inserted again But what entirely clears the Affair is King  James  's Declaration for had there been the least Shadow of Suspicion that  Ralegh  had been any Way concerned in  Keymis  's unfimely End we may be well persuaded that Declaration would not have been silent thereof which has amass'd and aggravated so many frivolous Circumstances in this Voyage against him  And this  as I compute happen'd about the latter End of  February  aforesaid or perhaps the former Part of  March  because  Ralegh  mentions it in the Letters he wrote this Month into  England  before referr'd to therefore the Death of  Keymis  could not happen in the following Summer as one Author mistakes And whereas some had given it out that  Keymis  slew himself through Remorse that he had seduced and deluded so many Gentlemen with an imaginary Mine  Ralegh  will not allow that to have been the Cause but ascribes it entirely to his own positive and passionate Temper and says that  he would not have laid violent Hands on himself for any Man's Opinion nor when he did adds  Ralegh  could he have said unto me that he was ignorant of the Place and knew of no such Mine for what Cause had I then to have rejected his Excuses or to have laid his Obstinacy to his Charge  Further urging  that several Captains  whom  Ralegh  names  might be put to their Oaths whether or no  Keymis  did not confess to them coming down the River at a Place where they cast Anchor that he could from thence have gone to the Mine in two Hours  After this Accident it was determined in a Council of the Officers to make for  Newfoundland  to repair and refresh their Ships but before as well as after they arrived there great Disorders arose Some took to Courses of their own Head and ran away from him as was beforementioned and many others proved so refractory and ungovernable that when he came to the Isle of  St Christopher's  he was forced under the Conduct of his Cousin Mr  Herbert  to ship them Home Of whom tho' he had  shewed some uncommon Generosity to some of them he says in the Letter he wrote from thence to his Wife on the d of  March I know then will not spare to wound me  and further declares  There is never a base Slave in all the Fleet that hath taken the Pains and Care that I have done that hath slept so little and travell'd so much My Friends will not believe them and for the Rest I care not  In another Letter he sent from hence at the same Time to Sir  Ralph Winwood  he writes to the same Sense and further adds  But these being gone I shall  says he  be able if I live to keep the Sea till the End of  August  with some four reasonable good Ships  for to that Number was his Fleet now reduced By the Time here proposed of continuing at Sea there might have now been Thoughts of some Course to qualify the Misadventure of the Mine and enable them to re attempt it perhaps by some little trading Voyages But how probable that he should design any Thing so far as the  EastIndies  or that with such small Force he intended to go for the Western Islands to attack the  Mexico  Fleet and surprize the Carracks as in the King's Declaration is laid to  Ralegh  's Charge we shall leave for others to decide 'Tis plain that nothing of this was put in Practice for when they came to  Newfoundland  the Company in his own Ship mutiny'd and those who were for staying aboard whom  Wilson  calls the major Part made  Ralegh  says he take an Oath not to go Home but by their Allowance But the Declaration says that the greater Number were for returning to  England  and that  Ralegh  getting on the Seabank put it to the Question whereupon the Voices divided starboard and larboard and that when he perceived the greater Number voted for their Return he went to that Side and voted so too but manifestly to the Hazard of his  Life was his voting on either Side In the same Declaration we are further led to believe he afterwards  offered his own Ship which was of great Value to his Company if they would only set him aboard a  French  Bark and that he made the same Offer to some of his Officers when he was come back to  Ireland  as not knowing how Things would be construed and being loth to put his Head under the King's Girdle  but he did and we shall see the Consequence of it  By the Time that  Ralegh  arrived on the Coast of  Ireland  the sacking of  St Thome  the firing of the Town and the Slaughter of the  Spaniards  to the Number of four or five hundred Men were largely descanted on by his Enemies as by his Friends were his own more particular Misfortunes in the long and dangerous Sickness he had endur'd his Disappointment in the Mine the Consumption of so much Treasure the Loss of his gallant Son the violent End of his old Servant Captain  Keymis  and above all the general Disorder Defection and Dispersion of his own Fleet All together it became not so much a national as a universal Topic of Discourse and Attention every one censuring or commiserating as their Interest or Affections mov'd It is remember'd by  Camden  that Captain  John North  Brother to the Lord  North  a valiant Gentleman and who was much esteemed by  Ralegh  for his faithful Conduct under him throughout this Voyage was the first who related the deplorable News of this unfortunate Expedition to King  James  on the th of  May  He seems to have done it in a very just and pathetical Manner and it might have had a good Effect had that King's Pity been as easily touch'd as his Fear Among Authors some who had been for registering this Commission of King  James  with that  granted by  Alphonso  King of  Naples  to  Bertram  his Captive  Moor  whom he intrusted both with his Liberty and a large Sum of Money to buy him some fine Horses in  Barbary  for which his Jester gave him a prime Place in his Fool's Chronicle were now upon the Expectation of a Return ready with the same Jester to blot out the King and enroll the Captive for a Fool But others look'd upon this Action of  Ralegh  's in a nobler and more elevated Light and as what for the Integrity of acquitting his fiduciary Pledges was rather to be compared with the generous Act of that brave  Roman  Consul  Attilius Regulus  who to keep his Promise and his Faith returned to his Enemies the  Carthaginians  under whom he had been a Prisoner tho' he knew that he went to inevitable Death  And now the  Spanish  Ambassador having by special Advertisements gain'd the earliest Intelligence of all that had passed at  Guiana  and how among the Rest his own Kinsman the Governor had been slain broke into the King's Presence in a turbulent Manner and bawling out for his Majesty's Audience only of one Word assaulted him with the abrupt and repeated Exclamation of  Piratas Piratas Piratas  At last he found Breath and Words to enlarge upon the Matter so effectually as what tended not only to the Infringement of his Majesty's Promise but that happy Union between the two Crowns in their Royal Progeny now the Match between Prince  Charles  and  Dona Maria  with all the Advantages it was pregnant with was in such a hopeful Degree of Maturity even to the involving of both Nations in the most durable and dreadful Hostilities that the pacifick King of  Great Britain  was ready to do any Thing in the World to appease him and hush it up To this  Purpose his Royal Proclamation was forthwith publish'd on the th of  June  setting forth that  Whereas we gave Liberty to Sir  Walter Ralegh  and others to undertake a Voyage to  Guiana  where they had pretended a Probability of discovering Gold Mines c We did by express Limitation and Caution restrain and forbid them from attempting any Act of Hostility upon any Territories or Subjects of foreign Princes with whom we are in Amity and more particularly those of our dear Brother the King of  Spain  in Respect of his Dominions in that Continent which notwithstanding they have by hostile Invasion of the Town of  St Thome c  broken and infringed We have therefore held fit to make publick Declaration of our utter Mislike and Detestation of the said Insolencies and for the better Detection and clearing up of the Truth we charge all our Subjects that have any Understanding or Notice thereof to repair to any of our Privy Council and make known their whole Knowledge that we m  y thereupon proceed to the Exemplary Punishment and Coercion of all such as are found guilty of so scandalous and enormous Outrages  The next Thing to be thought of was a proper and plausible Instrument for the Apprehension of Sir  Walter Ralegh  when he should come ashore such a one was Sir  Lewis Stucley  soon found to be and not Sir  John  as one Writer erroneously christens him who was ViceAdmiral of  Devon  not Lieutenant of the Tower as the same negligent Author mistakes again One who though  Ralegh  's Countryman and as all others but  Stucley  say his Kinsman too yet most officiously undertook that Charge through the sordid Prospect of Profit  so unnatural says  Wilson  and servile is the Spirit when it hath an Allay of Baseness there being many others fitter for that Employment  However  his Orders were to bring up this great Malefactor in a fair and courteous Manner according to his Majesty's gracious and mild Course as it is call'd in his Declaration And though we are told by one otherwise misguided in his Account of this Expedition by some distorted Representations of it in those Times  That the World much wonder'd so great a wise Man as Sir  Walter Ralegh  would return to cast himself upon so inevitable a Rock as it was feared he would  nevertheless as we are assured by Captain  Samuel King  an old Officer of  Ralegh  's who bore him Company all this while and has left us a particular Narrative of whatsoever occurr'd in their Journey from their landing now at  Plymouth  to their final Arrival at  London  that he no sooner put into the Harbour and heard of the Proclamation aforesaid against him than he resolved to surrender himself voluntarily into his Majesty's Hands and to that Intent both moor'd his Ship and sent his Sails ashore the first Day he landed which I take to have been in the Beginning of  July  and after he had been absent upon this Voyage a full Twelvemonth Moreover though he soon met here with several discouraging Reports also concerning the  Spanish  Ambassador's Stay at  London  only for his coming up to prosecute him as my said Manuscript Author has it  Ralegh  still continued firm in that Resolution The said Ambassador is in some common Memoirs said to have been sent for over to  Spain  at this Time and in some again that his Commission was expir'd but others think that Impatience to deliver the Success of his Negotiations spur'd him away according to Instruction when he had got full Assurance that  Ralegh  should be dispatch'd at some Rate or other whatever he could say for himself for he departed for  Spain  three Weeks before  Ralegh  came to  London  having left the Remainder of his Business in the Hands of some espanioliz'd Partisans at Court whom he had made sure  Here since we are to take our Leave of this  Don Diego Sarmiento▪  the following Remarks upon him may not be thought very digressory since they mostly tend to the further Illustration of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Story His first coming into  England  is remember'd by Sir  John Finet  in his Observations touching Foreign Ambassadors to have been in being aged then as I compute from a Date upon one of his Pictures Years Some have intimated that the  Spanish  Ambassador could not with all his worrying and baiting of King  James  prevail so effectually for the Destruction of Sir  Walter Ralegh  how easy and tempting soever it might be to trample over the Fence that is already broken down but that he was forced to belabour the Point with  Spanish  Gold among those Creatures who had the greatest Influence at Court For as one writes  The Bargain was made and  Ralegh  was devoted for a Sacrifice before they knew whether he was successful or not and if we may believe the Accounts that are left upon Record of that Part of History the King of  Spain  gave a good Sum of Money for his Head Some have gone so sar as to tell us who had the Money at least a good Part of it If this be true the  English  Court had in it at that Time some of the most infamous People that were ever concerned in any Administration As to those who reprove the King himself with it I shall say no more than this they ought to have been very sure of the Truth of it before they recorded a Thing of a  British  King so much beneath the Character of any Monarch in the World  viz  to take Money of an Enemy for the Blood of their own Subjects and of such Subjects too as were most dangerous to the very Enemy they were sold to which is neither less nor more than selling their own Safety as well as innocent Blood  See  An Historical Account of the Voyages and Adventures of Sir  Walter Ralegh  vo  p Howeever it was the  Spanish  Ambassador seems to have left the  English  Court well satisfied on the th and embark'd for  Spain  on the th of  July  having first emptied all the Prisons in  England  of  Romish  Priests many of whom he carried with him home further to grace his Triumphs But this Ambassador return'd to  England  in the Beginning of  March  under Pretence of pursuing that delusive Negotiation and was lodg'd not without Murmurs at the Bishop of  Eli  's House in  Holborne  He was also trick d out with titular Honours the usual Reward of such Services as his were being newly made  Conde de Gondomar  as Sir  John Finet  observes otherwise in the whole not so substantially rewarded at Home as the slavish Pains he took abroad to please his Prince was thought to deserve As for the pernicious Practices of this  Spanish  Ambassador in  England  which might gain him those airy Gratuities they are unfolded in a Tract entitled  Vox Populi  or  News from  Spain  translated according to the  Spanish  Copy which may serve to forewarn both  England  and the  United Provinces  how far to trust to  Spanish  Pretences  In t  is Treatise  Gondomar  is represented in a  Spanish  Council lately held at  Aragon  and delivering his chief Services to have been st His working a Dislike between King  James  and his House of Commons persuading him to to rule by his Prerogative and as for Money to furnish himself by the Marriage with  Spain  and by domestick Projects without any Subsidy▪ Also that he hereby kept  England  from furnishing its Navy dly His shewing only a colourable Resistance of our  EastIndia  Trade as being rather hurtful than helpful to the State by carrying out our solid Treasures and bringing Home Spice Silk Feathers and Toys besides wasting our Mariners dly His opposing our  WestIndian  Voyages most strenuously as what would raise another  England  to withstand their  New Spain  in  America  therefore that he cross'd all the Undertakings for  Virginia  and the  Bermudas  causing the Recusonts who were Sharers to withdraw their Ventures and discourage the Work thly That by this Means likewise he kept the voluntary Forces from  Venice  till it was almost too late to succour them thly That he stickled hard for the Cautionary Towns which the late King  Philip  called the Keys of the Low Countries And thly That the last and not the least Service he did was in overthrowing Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Voyage and pursuing him  I need not say almost to Death  says he  if all Things hit right▪ and all Strings hold  Further that his Commission would not let him tarry to be a Specta or of his Execution  which I desired the rather  says he  that by Concession I might have wrung from the inconsiderate  English  an Acknowledgment of my Master's Right in those Places punishing him for attempting there tho' they might prescribe for the first Foot And this I did to stop their Mouths hereafter and because I would quench the Heat and Valour of that Nation that none should ever dare hereafter to undertake the like or be so hardy as to look out at Sea▪ or breathe upon our Coast and lastly because I would bring to ignominious Death that old Pirate who is one of the last now living bred under that  English  Virago and by her flesh'd in our Blood and Ruin To do this I had many Agents first divers Courtiers who were hungry and gaped wide for  Spanish  Gold Secondly some who bare him at Heart for inveterate Quarrels Thirdly some Foreigners who having in vain sought the Elizir heretofore hope to find it in his Head Fourthly all Men of the  Komish  Faith who are of the  Spanish  Faction and would have been my Blood hounds to hunt him or any such to Death willingly And lastly I left behind me such an Instrument composed artificially▪ of a secular Understanding and a religious Profession as he is every Way adapted to screw himself into the Cl  set of the Heart and to work upon feminine Levity who in that Country have masculine Spirits to command and pursue their Plots unto Death  How much soever this may be called a fictitious Speech it is founded on such Matters of Fact that  Rushworth  and others of our most serious Historians have admitted the Substance thereof as perfect History  In about Easter  Gondomar  committed a gross Solecism in Politicks by suffering his ungovernable Passion so to expose his leiger Honour by striking  William Lithgow  the  Scotch  Traveller whom he had long deceived with Promises of Reparation for the Imprisonment Tortures and Robberies committed on him by the Inquisition at  Malaga  as may be read in the Book of his Travels that the said Ambassador got his Ears soundly box'd by him before a numerous Crowd of noble Witnesses "His Fistula says  Lithgow  meaning I think his Cane tho' alluding to his Disease was contrabanded by a Fist and for Victory Favour lent me Authority" He was imprisoned for it nine Weeks in the Marshals  a "Whence I returned says he with more Credit than he left  England  with Honesty" In  June  following as  Camden  tells us  Gondomar  was reported to be imprisoned in  Spain  for so much promoting the Match and that the  Infanta  was to be married to the Grand Duke of  Tuscany  However before he left  England  an excellent Letter seems to have been written by  Ralegh  in his own Defence and conveyed to the  King which as we have it in Print runs thus  May it please your most excellent Majesty If in my Journey outward bound I had my Men murdered at the Islands and yet spared to take Revenge if I  did discharge some  Spanish  Barks taken without Spoil if I did forbear all Parts of the  Spanish Indies  wherein I might have taken twenty of their Towns on the SeaCoasts and did only follow the Enterprize I undertook for  Guiana  where without any Directions from me a  Spanish  Village was burnt which was new set up within three Miles of the Mine by your Majesty's Favour I find no Reason why the  Spanish  Ambassador should complain of me  If it were lawful for the  Spaniards  to murder twentysix  Englishmen  tying them back to back and then cutting their Throats when they had traded with them a whole Month and came to them on the Land without so much as one Sword and it may not be lawful for your Majesty's Subjects being charged first by them to repel Force by Force we may justly say O miserable  English  If  Parker  and  Mecham  took  Campeachy  and other Places in the  Honduras  seated in the Heart of the  Spanish Indies  burnt Towns and killed the  Spaniards  and had nothing said unto them at their Return and myself who forbore to look into the  Indies  because I would not offend must be accus'd I may as justly say O miserable  Ralegh  If I have spent my poor Estate lost my Son suffer'd by Sickness and otherwise a World of Hardships if I have resisted with manifest Hazard of my Life the Robberies and Spoils with which my Companions would have made me rich if when I was poor I could have made myself rich if when I had gotten my Liberty which all Men and Nature itself do much prize I voluntarily lost it if when I was sure of my Life I rendered it again if I might elsewhere have sold my Ship and Goods and put five or six thousand Pounds in my Purse and yet brought her into  England  I beseech your Majesty to believe that all this I have done because it should not be said  thay your Majesty had given Liberty and Trust to a Man whose End was but the Recovery of his Liberty and who had betrayed your Majesty's Trust  My Mutineers told me that if I returned for  England  I should be undone but I believed in your Majesty's Goodness more than in all their Arguments Sure I am the first that being free and able to enrich myself yet hath embraced Poverty and Peril and as sure I am that my Example shall make me the last But your Majesty's Wisdom and Goodness I have made my Judges who have ever been and shall ever be your Majesty's most humble Vassal  Walter Ralegh  When  Ralegh  had settled his Affairs in the west of  England  he began his Journey to  London  pursuant to his first Resolution but before he came to  Ashburton  twenty Miles from  Plymouth  he was met by Sir  Lewis Stucley  who said  he had Orders for arresting him and his Ship Ralegh  answer'd  he had saved him the Labour and done it to his Hands  And though at that Time  Stucley  had no Warrant as our MS Author afores  d goes on for such Arrest either from the King or the Lords of the Council  for it seems that his Haste was so great and his Heart so set upon some supposed Purchase that he could not stay for a Warrant  yet  Ralegh  being told by him that he had such a verbal Commission from the Secretary did in no wife resist even that Authority So they went back together to  Plymouth  and lay at Sir  Christopher Harris  his House where Sir  Walter Ralegh  was so little watch'd that he was sometimes two or three Days without seeing Sir  Lewis Stucley  And  Ralegh  himself says that  Stucley  left him nine or ten Days to go where he listed while he rode about the Country However as we learn from Captain  King  it did at last come into  Ralegh  's Mind whether upon some private Advices how insuperably  the Prejudice of his Enemies was working against him or any Suggestions of his own how he might work a Reconciliation more successfully from abroad it is not said but contrive he did to convey himself out of the Kingdom Therefore while they were at  Plymouth  he employ'd our Author the said Captain  King  to provide him a Bark that would carry him over into  France  King  James  's Declaration says  Ralegh  dealt with for a Bark as for a Friend and proffered twelve Crowns for the Passage  Stucley  says he dealt with two Captains of  French  Barks the Declaration says  Ralegh  was then under no Guard and  Stucley  that he was then under his keeping But leaving these Inconformities to others I here follow Captain  King  who informs us that himself procur'd the Vessel which is most likely and that he detain'd it nigh four Days riding at Anchor beyond command of the Fort The first Night about one of the Clock they secretly took Boat to have gone Aboard but before they reach'd the Bark  Ralegh  whether through some more prevailing Thought that might arise of a generous Reliance upon the King or a more confident Dependance upon the Justice of his Cause or for any thing he left behind or would have first left either in Writing or otherwise does not yet appear but certain it is he changed his Resolution and returned to his Lodging unsuspected by any one The next Day he sent Money to the Master of the Bark to retain him one Night more and yet  Ralegh  never went nigh him afterwards  It has been objected as Captain  King  goes on who does not say by whom but I find it in the King's Declaration that  Ralegh  was obliged to return because the Night was so Dark that he could not find the Vessel  But I says the Captain who  was with him will take my Oath that if he had been only willing to have rowed a quarter of a Mile further he might have seen her Besides if that Night would not have served one of the other three would the Wind being fair and the Tide falling out conveniently  After this says Captain  King Stucley  received a Warrant to bring up Sir  Walter Ralegh  but with no more speed than his Health would permit and he took to his Assistance one  Manourie  a  French  Quack  upon what Occasion says  King  I here willingly omit as well because I would not meddle with any Instrument of State as because I little suspecting what followed was somewhat careless in the Observance of their Carriage  In their Journey they baited and lodg'd at divers Gentlemens Houses of  Ralegh  's Acquaintance upon the Road from some of whom hearing more distinctly the nearer he approach'd it what a storm his Enemies had brew'd at Court he began to regret his having neglected the Opportunity he had at  Plymouth  of retiring which he discoursed of to his Lady and to Me says Captain  King  who told him  He could blame none but himself  But after that peremptory Warrant which a Pursuivant brought down for the speedy bringing up of his Person he began again to meditate upon a Retreat tho' as he grew more desirous it grew more difficult Therefore when he had made such inland Advancement on his Journey as to have no Means left that would favour him by Water  He once more employed me says Captain  King  who was always ready to do any thing that might procure his Safety being well assur'd in my own Conscience tho' he sought to absent himself till the  Spanish  Fury was over yet as he always said That no Misery should make him Disloyal to his King or Country And altho'  Manourie  in his Declaration sets down that Sir  Walter Ralegh  should to him in private speak ill of his Majesty yet I must protest till my last Hour that in all the Years I followed him I never heard him name his Majesty but with Reverence I am sorry the Assertion of that Man should prevail so much against the Dead  The particulars of Captain  King  's Employment for this second Escape we shall respite a while to make way for those which according to the due Course of Time must now be recur'd to out of that  Frenchman  's Declaration as Captain  King  calls it above and shall do it with such Justice as not to omit or disguise any of the ill Words against his Majesty ascribed to  Ralegh  therein But can only do it from that which was suffer'd to appear after  Ralegh  's Death annexed to King  James  's Declaration and thereby chuse rather to hazard a Trespass upon the Patience of some Readers who may think it a Detail of improbable at least insignificant Objections than incur the Censure of Partiality from others in omitting it since King  James  and consequently his Council thought it would pass for Matter of such Importance by their making it so great a Part of what was hoped would justify his Proceedings against  Ralegh  and of such Authority as to need no other Evidence not that it is there too expressively or positively call'd  Manourie  's Declarations or his Confession or Examination upon Oath but by a pretty light pliable Phrase 'tis said  The Story himself reporteth to have passed in this Manner  Upon  Saturday  the th of  July  Sir  Walter Ralegh  Sir  Lewis Stucley  and the said  Manourie  went to he at Mr  Drake  's where the Letters of Commission from the Privy Council were brought to Sir  Lewis Stucley  and that  Ralegh  hereat changing  Countenance exclaimed with an Oath Is it possible my Fortune should return upon me thus again This hastening their Departure they advanc'd on  Sunday  Morning nearer to  London  about four Miles and baited at Mr  Horsey  's That here  Ralegh  first caused  Manourie  to be founded what was in his Heart suspecting apparently that he was designed as a Spy over him by his Old Domestick Captain  King  who discoursing  Manourie  upon  Ralegh  's Calamities said  I wish we were all at  Paris  Manourie  answer'd  I would we were all at  London  what should we do at  Paris  Because  said  King as soon as we come to  London  they will commit Sir  Walter  to the  Tower  and cut off his Head Manourie  said  he hoped better Things and that according to his Ability he was ready to do him all honest Service  After Dinner they set forward for  Sherborne  and here  Ralegh  is said to tell  Manourie All that was his and the King had unjustly taken it from him Manourie  and  Ralegh  's Retinue lay in the Town that Night but  Ralegh  himself and  Stucley  at old Mr  Parham  's On  Monday  they got to  Salisbury  where as  Ralegh  was walking on foot down the Hill and had found by Enquiry that  Manourie  had got some Physick about him he desired him to prepare a Vomit against Morning  For I know  said he as he is here represented with a surprizing Faith already in such a Man  'twill be good to evacuate bad Humours and by this Means I shall gain Time to work my Friends order my Assairs and perhaps pacify his Majesty otherwise as soon as I come to  London  they'll have me to the Tower and cut off my Head which I cannot escape without counterfeiting Sickness which your Vomits will effect without Suspicion  Accordingly that at  Salisbury  he complained of a Dimness of Sight with a Dizziness in his Head and  when he was conducted towards his Chamber that he stagger'd and struck himself with such Violence against a Pillar in the Gallery as made  Stucley  think he was sick indeed and in that Belief  Manourie  left him for that Time On  Tuesday  Morning  Ralegh  sent his Lady with the greatest Number of his Servants forwards to  London  and now it was he also sent Captain  King  thither on the Expedition aforesaid whom we shall meet with there prepared for the same as soon as  Manourie  is brought to an End of this same Story Then comes a Servant of  Ralegh  's into  Stucley  's Chamber and declares his Master was out of his Wits that he left him in his Shirt upon all four scratching and gnawing the Rushes on the Planks  Stucley  sent  Manourie  who found him in Bed and asking  what he ail'd  he answer'd  Nothing but that he did it on Purpose  That then  Ralegh  asked for the Vomit and took it without any Hesitation At  Stucley  's Entrance that he fell a raving and before his Vomit operated had such strong Convulsions upon him that  Stucley  and all the Help he could get were not strong enough to prevent the Contraction of his Sinews as fast as the Company could draw them straight insomuch that  Stucley  caused him to be chaf'd and fomented but that  Ralegh  truly afterwards laugh'd at it to  Manourie  and said such a Confident is he now grown  he had made  Stucley  a perfect Physician  In the next Place  Ralegh  must be observed to take some Repose so  Manourie  is shut into the Room with him and having dissuaded him from a more violent Vomit because his first did not yet work  Ralegh  ask'd if he knew not of some Preparation which would make him look ghastly and i  ksome outwardly and not affect the Vitals or make him inwardly sick After a Pause  Manourie  assur'd him he could furnish him with an harmless Ointment which would yet soon make him all over like a Leper  Whereby we are told  Ralegh  said the Lords would be afraid to approach him and that it would move their Pity besides  Soon after he had been thus anointed on the Brows Arms and Breast the Blisters rose successfully and so soon ripen'd to their full Discolourations that  Stucley  at his next Visit perceiving  Ralegh  's Body all broke out in purple Spots with yellow Heads and the rest of his Skin so inflamed with Heat concluded he was struck over with the Plague and that it was highly contagious But asking  Manourie  's Opinion he truly concealed all for that as yet he knew nothing of  Ralegh  's intended Flight but thought it was only to gain Time to satisfy his Majesty However away went  Stucley  to the grave Bishop  Andrews  then upon the Point of his Translation to  Winchester  and soon made known what a frightful Figure Sir  Walter Ralegh  was become described all the Tokens upon him and in the End return'd with two Doctors and one Batchelor of Physick All their Skill could not enlighten them with one Spark of Knowledge in the Nature of his Distemper but they gave their Opinion in Writing that the Patient could not be removed into the Air without manifest Hazard of his Life and  Manourie  set his Hand to it  Here  Ralegh  is describ'd to have been much delighted that Matters went on so prosperously especially that the Vomit worked so thoroughly in the presence of these learned Doctors But having apprehended they would inspect his Water he directed  Manourie  to rub the Urinal with a certain D  ug which turned all to such a dismal Colour and such a disagreeable Scent that if Heaven did not prescribe the Patient must perish for nothing  could the Physicians do but pronounce the Disease mortal Further that he then made  Manourie  bind his Arm about with the black Silk Ribband which he took from his Poniard but that not distempering his Pulse agreeable to Expectation he had more Blisters raised the next Day By this Time his Physick having opened his Stomach and made him hungry he got  Manourie  secretly to buy a Leg of Mutton and three Loaves which he fed upon in private and by this Subtilty was thought to have fasted three Days that is to  Friday  the last of  July  ever feigning great Indisposition and Uneasiness in Company but when alone for to get the Opportunity of being so was the chief Source of all the Artifice he did here really put in Practice he wrote his Declaration or Apology and is said to have got  Manourie  to make him a Transcript of it which was as the Penman of this Story further says since presented to his Majesty But by an Expression of that Ambiguity and Latitude whether we are designed to understand it was before or after  Ralegh  's Death that Penman intelligent enough in other Parts of  Manourie  's said Story and the rest of the King's Declaration for they were both of them visibly cast in one Mould might think it not necessary to be so here It was surely a most vexatious Stratagem that  Ralegh  should unexpectedly make such a provoking Vindication of his Voyage and thereby defeat the Preparations that were making to cut him off for it but however it may▪ in the Opinion of Posterity have cleared his innocence among his Cotemporaries it could not secure his Safety  The same Night as the Story goes on apparently to ra  se inflammations beyond his own Person he insinuated to  Stucley  that he thought he had taken Po  n at Mr  Pa  ham  's for that he was a Papist  and kept a Priest in his House but desired and particularly to  Monsieur  that it might not be spoken of A while after being in his BedChamber undress'd and no Body present but his Friend  Manourie  he is said to have taken a Lookingglass in his Hand to admire his spotted Face and to have merrily observed to his said Confident  how they should one Day laugh for having thus cozen'd the King Council Physicians and  Spaniards  and all  On the first of  August  being the Day that the King arrived in his Progress at  Salisbury Ralegh  is said to have taken  Manourie  in private and having open'd a red Leather Trunk put into his Hand nine Pieces of  Spanish  Gold saying  There is twenty Crowns in Pistoles which I give you for your Physical Receipts and the Victuals you bought me and I will give you fifty Pounds a Year if you will do what I tell you and if Sir  Lewis Stucley  asks what Conference you have had with me tell him that you comfort me in my Adversity and that I make you no other Answer than what is here written  giving him a Piece of Paper containing these Words  Ve la M Manourie l'acceptance de tous mes travaux perte de mon Estate et de mon fils mes maladies et douleurs Ve la c'effect de ma Confience au Roy  As much as to say  Behold there  M Manourie  the Fruit of all my Toils the Loss of my Fortune and of my Son the Sickness I have endured and the Sorrows behold there the Effect of that Faith I reposed in his Majesty  But behold wherefor that  ve la  or  voila  repeated as it is plainly points at some more copious or convincing Evidence which accompanied this Expression and more particularly demonstrated those Losses and Afflictions to have been the Fruit of  Ralegh  's Trust or Faith in the King to which these Words appear but a bare Direction and which therefore seems here to have been suppress'd  Which Paper of  Ralegh  's own Hand▪Writing was afterwards produced by  Manourie  And now  Ralegh  is pretended to practise more unreservedly still about the Escape with  Manourie  as being all in his Power to aid him and he the only Person trusted by  Stucley  Whereupon he proposes that  Ralegh  at his coming to  London  should lie  perdue  at a Friend of  Manourie  's in  ShireLane  which did not long engage his Approbation for  Ralegh  resolved otherwise telling this only Person trusted by  Stucley  through an incredible Profuseness of Communication  that he had sent Captain  King  to hire him a Bark below  Gravesend  which would go with all Winds and another little Boat to carry him to it  Adding that  to hide himself in  London  he should be always apprehensive of a Discovery by the general Searchers that are there but that to escape he must get Leave to go to his own House and being there he would so handle the Matter as to slip from  Stucley  through a Backdoor into the Boat with Ease for no Body would dream he could go on Foot seeing him so feeble as he seemed to be  Then that  Manourie  should say  Why would you fly your Apology and your last Declaration do they not sufficiently justify you  and that  Ralegh  should silence him with  Tell me no more a man that fears is never secure  In the next Place  Ralegh  is said to have procur'd the King's Licence to be at his own House when he should come to  London  and that when  Manourie  hereupon observed his Majesty seem'd not inclin'd to take away his Life since he suffer'd him to repair to his own Habitation for the Recovery of his Health that  Ralegh  should reply  They used all these Kinds of Flatteries to the Duke of  Bi  on  to draw him fairly into Prison and then they cut off his Head  Adding  I know they have concluded among them it is expedient that a Man should die to reassure the Traffick which I have broken with  Spain Thereupon says our Story he broke forth into the most hateful and traiterous Words against the King's own Person but it surprisingly omits them all to object only his ending with this improbable Rant  that if he could but save himself for this Time he would plot such Plots as should make the King think himself happy to send for him again and restore him to his Estate with Advantage yea and would force the King of  Spain  to write into  England  in his Favour  Nay when  Manourie  as we are further persuaded shewed such Care and Concern for  Stucley  as to ask what would become of him if  Ralegh  escap'd Whether he would be put to Death or lose his Office and Estate  Ralegh  is said to answer  Not to Death but he would be imprison'd for a while yet his Lands were assured to his eldest Son and for the rest it was no Part of his Care  Then  Manourie  asks if it were not Treason in himself to be aiding to his Escape  No answers  Ralegh  you are a Foreigner However if you pretend to know any Thing they'll put you in Prison But what if I am discover'd to have a Hand in your Escape  says t'other  Why follow me into  France  your own Country replies  Ralegh  quit all and I will make amends for all  As they travell'd between  Andover  and  Stains Manourie  as this Story that is ascrib'd to him acknowledges discovered  Ralegh  's intended Escape to  Stucley  who thenceforth used extraordinary Diligence in Guards and Watches upon him which  Ralegh  perceiving as it is also own'd nevertheless trusts  Manourie  with a new Proposal at  Stains  in these Words  I see it is not possible to escape by our two Means alone  Stucley  is so watchful and sets such strict Guard upon me and will be too hard for us with all our Cunning therefore there is no Way but  to make him of our Council and if we can persuade him to let me save myself I will give him in Hand the Worth of two hundred Pounds Sterling  Upon these Words he drew forth and shewed  Manourie  a Jewel made in the Fashion of Hail powder'd with Diamonds having a Ruby in the middle valued at a hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling and putting it into his Hands said  Besides this Jewel he shall have fifty Pounds in Money pray tell him as much from me and persuade him to it I know he will trust you  This Overture being made by  Manourie Stucley  after some Parley sent back Word by him to  Ralegh that he would accept of his Offer and bad him tell  Ralegh  he was content to do as he had desired but would chuse rather to go with him than tarry behind with Shame and Reproach  directing  Manourie  further to ask  how this could be done without losing his Office of ViceAdmiral which cost him six hundred Pounds also to what Place they should go how they should live afterwards and what Means he would carry with him to furnish this intended Escape Ralegh  obviates all this with praying him to tell  Stucley that if he would swear unto him not to discover him he would tell him his whole Intent and that for the first Point though  Stucley  were to lose his Office he should yet be no loser that as soon as he was got into  France  or  Holland  his Wife was to send him a thousand Pounds and that he should carry with him only a thousand Crowns in Money and Jewels to serve at present  After Supper  Ralegh  is further represented so open so contrary to all his former Character and beyond all Manner of Belief as to say  O if I could escape without  Stucley  I should do bravely but it's no Matter I'll carry him along and afterwards dispatch myself of him well enough  Then  Manourie  having apprised  Stucley  of all that pass'd brought them together  Ralegh  shewed the Jewel and probably deliver'd it for  Stucley  shewed himself content and it was probably upon the Acceptance of it but desired a little Respite to dispose of his Office  Manourie  having thus seen the Agreement made took his Leave of them for  London  the Part design'd for him ending here after having said to  Ralegh he did not think of seeing him again while he was in  England  Ralegh  at parting gave him by a Letter to a Person at  Radford  an Iron Furnace with a Distillatory of Copper belonging to it and charged him  to tell every Body he met how sick he was and that he left him in an extreme Looseness that very Night  But as  Ralegh  had dispatch'd Captain  King  to  London  with Instructions to be in Readiness for him he kept moving on when there fell out an Accident which gave him fresh Hopes to facilitate his Escape For when he came to his Inn at  Brentford  he was met by a  Frenchman  named  La Chesnay  a Follower of  Le Clerc  Agent from the  French  King who told  Ralegh  the said  French  Agent was very desirous to speak with him as soon as he got to  London  about some Affairs which highly concerned his Safety Accordingly the next Night after  Ralegh  was at  London  the said  Le Clerc  and  La Chesnay  came to visit him at his House and there  Le Clerc  offer'd him a  French  Bark which he had prepared for him to escape in and withal his Letters recommendatory for his safe Conduct and Reception to the Governor of  Calais  and to send a Gentleman expresly that should attend and meet him there But  Ralegh  understanding the  French  Bark not to be so ready nor so fit as that he had already proposed for himself gave him Thanks and told him that he would  make use of his own Bark but for his Letters and the rest of his Offer that he should be beholden to him because his Acquaintance in  France  was worn out  Ralegh  might say this to get his Recommendation the stronger but indeed his Fame was now in high Request at the  French  Court For one of the noblest Scholars in  France Nicholas Claudius Fabricius  Lord of  Peresk  writing soon after a Letter over to  Camden  concludes it with these Words highly in his Favour  The  French  Agent having form'd a Design of conveying Sir  Walter Ralegh  to  France Monsieur de la Chesnaye  was examined before the Lords of the Council who confess'd that  Le Clerc  had employ'd him for that Purpose  Le Clerc  was then cited to appear before them but as Punctilios often arise in Relation to Ambassadors so here a Dispute sprung up which seem'd to add to the Indignation already conceiv'd against Sir  Walter  for  Le Clerc  refus'd to answer any Interrogatories till the Lords of the Council should stand up and be uncovered as he was insisting that Sir  W Becher  when Agent for King  James  in  France  had claimed a Right to the same Privilege and was granted it To which the Lords reply'd that different Countries had different Forms but in Order to set all Objections aside they remov'd out of the Council Chamber into a private Room where no Ceremony was observ'd and  Le Clerc  being confronted by  Le Chesnaye  confess'd the whole Affair King  James  being inform'd thereof  Le Clerc  was forbid all further Exercise of his Charge and ordered not to appear at Court till it was known whether or no the  French  King approv'd of his Conduct  With this Passage and a Word or two only of  Ralegh  's Attempt to escape after he came to  London  it not being thought proper here to expatiate upon the Arts used in betraying it ends the tedious Fardel of Objections accumulated to render him unworthy of Mercy in the King's Declaration and the Story ascribed to the obscure  Frenchman  aforesaid in it but unconfirmed by any Affidavit or Evidence upon Oath which in other such Cases have been thought necessary Vouchers therefore how far to be call'd heinous Offences Acts of Hostility Depredations Abuses of his Charge Impostures and Declensions of Justice the Reader  may now first give his own Judgment and then compare it with what has been before said of these Accusations by others  Upon the great Murmurs which arose at the putting Sir  Walter Ralegh  to Death King  James  publish'd a Declaration which instead of mitigating the Affair only aggravated it in the Eye of the World And an Author writing on this Subject says  that his Crime was in having more Merit than such a Prince k  w how to value  for his Attempt at  Guiana  was even by his very Enemies judg'd reasonable  And now comes on the Remainder of Captain  King  's Narrative wherein he tells us that from  Salisbury  he was sent before to  London  to provide a Boat and to lay her as low as  Tilbury  and that he was also advised to put one  Cotterell  in Trust who had been  Ralegh  's Servant for the Provision of a Wherry As soon as  King  came to  London  he dealt with  Cotterell  who seem'd as willing to do Sir  Walter  Service as himself but telling him of one  Hart  who had been Boatswain to the said Captain's Ship and had a Ketch of his own with him the Captain therefore agreed and gave him Money to get it in Readiness having vowed Secrecy upon the Reward which the Captain further promised him But he had no sooner received the  thirty Pieces of Silver  than he betray'd the Design to Mr  William Herbert  who as suddenly divulg'd it but  King  not suspecting any Discovery still fed  Hart  with Money to keep the Ketch at  Tilbury  On Friday Night which was the th of  August  Sir  Walter Ralegh  came to  London  when Captain  King  attended on him at his Lodgings but was told by  Ralegh  that he could in no wise get ready to go off that Night It seems to be the next Day that  Stucley  got his Warrant to indemnify him for any Contract he should enter into with Sir  Walter Ralegh  or to authorize his Compliance with any  Offer he should make him for his Escape or in short as others have not spared to call it a Licence to betray him for tho'  Ralegh  might now have been secur'd in a direct and undisguised Manner yet the Glory was to do it insidiously and under the Vizor of Friendship being not more suitable to the Genius of predominant Power than necessary on the present Occasion to give Room for so many more little Circumstances of Objection as might occur to supply the Place of one wanting that should have been capital And this Night it was that the  French  Ambassador aforesaid came to  Ralegh  's House and made the Proposal before recited But when Capt  King  came to him again the same Night  Ralegh  said there was no going now without  Stucley  whom he doubted not but he should engage to go along with him and that the next Night without Failure he would meet the Captain at the  TowerDock  As for Mr  Herbert  aforesaid he was employ'd in  garrowing  Sir  Walter Ralegh  's House as the Captain phrases it while  Ralegh  being thus drawn out of it by  Stucley  under Pretence of bearing him Company might be the more unexpectedly seiz'd with all such private Papers as he should have about him in Hopes no doubt that by one means or other something might turn out to make a Charge of sufficient Weight against him But in the Conclusion says our said Author all the Papers which were found prov'd to be no other than what might without any Discredit have been laid open to all the World  Capt  King  went as he further tells us on  Sunday  Night to the Place appointed with two Wherries and Sir  Walter Ralegh  also came thither having put on a false Beard and a Hat with a green Hatband He was accompany'd with Sir  Lewis  Stucley  young  Stucley  and his own Page Then asking Captain  King  if all Things were ready he answer'd they were and that the Cloakbag and the four Pistols were in the Boat  Stucley  then saluted Captain  King  and ask'd  whether  thus far  he had not distinguished himself an honest Man  to which  King  answer'd  that he hop'd he would  continue  so  After they enter'd the Boats and divided the Pistols they had not rowed above twenty Strokes before the Watermen told them that Mr  Herbert  had lately taken Boat and made as if he would have gone through Bridge but return'd down the River after them This rais'd some Apprehension in  Ralegh  but upon  Stucley  's Encouragement they row'd on yet  Ralegh  not well satisfy'd call'd Captain  King  near to him who was in the other Boat with young  Stucley  and  Hart  and intimated that he could not go forward unless he was sure of the Watermen whom he then also spake to asking whether if any should come to arrest them in the King's Name they would row forwards or return At this the great Boobies were so frighten'd that they cry'd and answer'd they knew no body there but Captain  King  who had hired them to  Gravesend  and that they neither dared nor would go any further  Ralegh  said that a brabbling Matter with the  Spanish  Ambassador was the Cause that of Necessity he must go to  Tilbury  to embark for the  Low Countries  and that he would give them ten Pieces of Gold for their Pains  Then began  Stucley  's Part cursing and damning himself that he should be so unfortunate as to venture his Life and Fortune with a Man so full of Doubts and Fears He swore that if the Watermen would not row on he would kill them and persuaded  Ralegh  that there was no such Danger as he  suspected of which Opinion Capt  King  also still was Thus the Time pass'd till they drew near  Greenwich  when a Wherry cross'd them which  Ralegh  said came to discover them  King  sought to dissuade him from this Supposition and told him that if they could but reach  Gravesend  he would hazard his Life to get to  Tilbury  These Delays spent the Tide and the Watermen said it was impossible to get to  Gravesend  before Morning Hereupon  Ralegh  would have landed at  Purfleet  and  Hart  would have possess'd him that tho' it was Night he could procure him Horses to  Tilbury Stucley  appear'd very zealous for this Proposal and said that upon that Condition he could be content to carry the Cloakbag on his own Shoulders half a Mile but  King  told him that if they could not go by Water it was impossible at that Time of Night to get Horses to go by Land  By this Time they had rowed as far as  Woolwich  or rather about a Mile beyond which might be to a Reach call'd the  Gallions  near  Plumstead  Here approaching two or three Ketches  Hart  began to doubt whether any one of them was his Upon this  Ralegh  concluded they were all betray'd and bid the Watermen turn back hoping to have got to his own House before Morning and began to examine  Hart  very strictly who pretended he had given his Men express Charge not to stir from  Tilbury  till he came down but this would not induce  Ralegh  to proceed Before they had rowed back a Furlong they espied another Wherry and hailing her they said they were for the King  Ralegh  perceiving they were some of Mr  Herbert  's Crew proposed to  Stucley  seeing they were discover'd and in Respect to his Safety that he might remain still in his Custody and that  Stucley  should openly declare to the Watermen he was his Prisoner  which he did Here  Stucley  and he fell into private Discourse contriving how  Ralegh  might reach his House and how  Stucley  might save himself harmless by saying that he only pretended to go along with  Ralegh  in order to discover his Intentions and seize upon his private Papers Then they whisper'd some Time together and  Ralegh  taking some Things out of his Pockets whether more Rubies powder'd with Diamonds our Author does not say and gave them to  Stucley  who all this while not only hugg'd and embrac'd him as it seem'd with the greatest Tenderness but made the utmost Protestations of Love Friendship and Fidelity When they were got back to  Greenwich Stucley  said that he durst not carry  Ralegh  to his House but persuaded him to land which they did the other strange Boat landing at the same Time in which the Men they perceived belong'd to Mr  W Herbert  and Sir  William St John  the same who had made good Profit of  Ralegh  before as we have read Upon  Greenwich  Bridge  Stucley  told Capt  King  it would be for Sir  Walter  's Good that he should pretend he was consenting with him to betray his Master  King  not able to fathom the Depth of this Policy as he tells us refus'd it thinking he should not only thereby bely his own Conscience but make himself odious to the World therefore tho'  Ralegh  himself made some Motion of it to him he could not how serviceable soever it might prove be guilty of so much Insincerity towards him Then  Stucley  arrested the Captain in his Majesty's Name and committed him to the Charge of two of Mr  Herbert  's Men After this they all went to a Tavern and by the way Captain  King  heard  Ralegh  say  Sir  Lewis  these Actions will not turn out to your Credit Ralegh  was kept apart from  King  till Morning when as they  enter'd into the Tower  Ralegh  said to him  Stucley  and  Cotterell  have betray'd me adding for your Part you need be in Fear of no Danger but as for me it is I am the Mark that is shot at Then Captain  King  being forced to take his leave left  Ralegh  to his Tuition with whom I do not doubt  says he  but his Soul resteth And so concludes his Narrative  Here the curious Reader would probably be willing to know what  Stucley  had to say for himself upon this Business and this I have some Opportunity of relating from the Tract he publish'd at  Ralegh  's Death in his own Defence which tho' for its Author's Behaviour aforesaid it has been so much disregarded that of all the Historians general and particular who have written of Sir  Walter Ralegh  and some few of them whose Characters are pretty well known to his Disparagement I never met with one who has shewn it so much Credit as to quote it Yet as I have found some few Passages not altogether useless in explaining other Parts of this Life so those which concern this Part I have thought proper more particularly here to insert in observance to a good biographical Maxim which enjoins us as far as the Parts they bear in our Narrative will permit to shew a due Respect to the Characters of all Men and consequently not in Favour of any to prostitute our own  In this Tract which is properly enough address'd to the King one of the earliest Motives to Revenge in that poor Instrument of State as  Stucley  no less properly calls himself against  Ralegh  appears to be a Pretence that  Ralegh  had abridg'd  Stucley  's Father of an incredible dividend in a Prize many Years before taken at Sea whereof a more particular Account has been before given  in its proper Place as the last Motive will appear to be what  Ralegh  said of this  Stucley  in his dying Speech But the Arguments  Stucley  makes Use of for having betray'd him are drawn first from  Ralegh  's having pretended to be poison'd at Sir  Edward Parham  's House who was  Stucley  's Kinsman For he reports  Ralegh  to have said  Tho' the Gentleman would not hurt me yet there might be Priests that did it for I remember after my Morning's Draught of a Cup of Ale which Sir  Edward Parham  offer'd me in the Hall I felt presently a kind of Excoriation in my Bowels as if some Jesuit had been the Butler Now says  Stucley  when I saw the Pustles break out upon him at  Salisbury  my Compassion I confess was too credulous to report it  But that being thus deceived himself and thereby wronging his Kinsman it moved his Indignation against  Ralegh  for abusing both so that in short he drew  Ralegh  to his Destruction by a Lie because he had induced  Stucley  to asperse his Kinsman with one And tho' Divinity would not as  Stucley  owns yet Reason of State would hold it lawful to lie for the Discovery of Treason in service to the Commonwealth Then he endeavours to reconcile himself to the Commonwealth by answering the Objection of his being so Instrumental to the depriving it of so sufficient a Member as had not left his Equal behind him in these Words  No Man denies but he had many Sufficiencies in him But what were these but so many Weapons of Practice and Danger against the State if he escaped being so deeply tainted in so many Points of Discontent Dishonesty and Disloyalty He knew as he had written that as in Nature so in Policy  a privatione ad habitum not fit regressio  And therefore being desperate of any Fortune here agreeable to the Height of his Mind who can doubt but he would have made up his Fortune  elsewhere upon any Terms against his Soveraign and Country  In another Place which relates to  Ralegh  's last Endeavours of escaping he tells the King  On the  Saturday  when I received your Majesty's Commission by my Cousin  Herbert  I received also Intelligence by him that at that Instant  Ralegh  was flying from my Custody without my Privity not having as yet made him any Semblance of Condescent so that I almost came upon him unawares even as he was putting on his false Beard and other Disguisements which declares he did still distrust your Goodness doubtless out of the Conscience of his Guiltiness whatever he writ or said to the contrary And is it any marvel then that he was angry with me at his Death for bringing him back Besides being a Man as he was thought of so great a Wit it was no small Grief that a Man of so mean Wit as I should be thought to go beyond him Yea but you should not have used such Craft to go beyond him No  Sic ars deluditur arte Neque enim lex justior ulla est quam necis artifices arte perire sua  But why did you not execute your Commission bravely to his Apprehension on him in his House Why my Commission was to the contrary to discover his Pretensions and to seize his secret Papers c And can any honest Subject question my Honesty in the Performance of such a Commission which tended to discover the secret Intentions of an illaffected Heart to my Soveraign How can any dislike this in me and not bewray his own dishonest Heart unto the State Yea but tho' another might have done this yet how might you do it being his Kinsman and his Friend Surely if I had been so yet in a publick Employment and Trust laid upon me I was not to refuse it much less to prefer private Kindness and Amity before my publick Duty and Loyalty for what did I know the dangerous Consequence of these Matters which were to  be discovered or who knows them yet of those that make themselves my competent Judges But if there were no Kindred or Amity between us as I avow there never was what Bond then might tie me to him but the Tie of Compassion to his Miseries which was in my Sovereign's Heart to distribute when he saw Time that did command me and not in the Dispensation of me nor of any other  Instrument's  Power that is to be commanded  These are his Arguments and he concludes his Pamphlet with making two humble Petitions to his most excellent Majesty  First seeing that I your poor loyal Subject am burdened and oppressed with the Testimony of a bitter Enemy of a perjured and condemned Man against all Reason Conscience and Law that I may have your Majesty's Leave to the Confirmation of the Truth which I have avowed to be sufficient to receive the Sacrament upon it in your Majesty's Chapel  But if he did receive the Sacrament to confirm the Truth of his Assertions for this seems to be the Meaning of his Words if they have or were intended to have any how that would justify the Falshood of his Actions and how his taking of the Sacrament would be of any Credit to him who has own'd that Divinity would not hold his Practices lawful or how clear him for the Violation of that Trust and Fidelity he had before taken the Sacrament as we shall hear presently to maintain he was not thought a Casuist or even Instrument of State enough to resolve the last Petition is  That his Majesty would be so gracious as to suffer a Declaration to come forth from the State for the clearing of these Matters and further Satisfaction of the World  which plainly discovers that this Pamphlet sent out under the Name of this Instrument was a mere concerted Preparative to the said Declaration which so observantly followed it like a  Fomentation to supple the Minds of the uneasy People that the soveraign Unguent might enter more effectually But how little Satisfaction the said Declaration gave we have already noted and for  Stucley  's Performance it made not so much as himself easy being in his own Opinion so insufficient to deface the black and odious Stains of his Conduct that he was forced to write an Apology besides and that was so little regarded as never to have been thought worthy of the Press Whether his Life was more successful than his Writings and how it fared with him after this Piece of Courtservice may be gathered from several Authors Some historical Compurgators of this Reign and consequently no Friend to Ralegh's Memory yet own that Stucley's Destiny was suitable to his Dealings being afterwards hang'd say they for clipping of Gold But those who had better Intelligence and knew the Truth more particularly have delivered it more perfectly where they affirm  That  Stucley  having for a Bag of Money falsified his Faith which he had confirmed by the Tie of the Holy Sacrament he was before the Year came about caught clipping the same Coin in the King's own House at  Whitehall  which he had received as the Reward of his Perfidiousness for which being eondemned to be hang'd he was driven to sell himself to his Shirt to purchase his Pardon of two Knights Then to avoid the Sight and Scorn of Mankind withdrew himself to a little Island in the Severn Sea called the  Isle of Lundy  and there died a poor distracted Beggar  Which as we find it elsewhere sufficiently confirmed was in less than two Years after  Ralegh  's Death Thus horribly did the Deceiver's Reward prove his Punishment and thus we leave this notable Monument of unprosperous Treachery  Ralegh  as was before mentioned was now Prisoner again in the Tower of  London  being brought thither on  Monday  Morning the th of  August  About two or three Days after a Committee was selected to examine into the aforesaid Escape it being a Matter luckily capable and highly necessary to be enlarged upon in order to fill up the Measure of Accusation Such a premeditated Flight was therefore declaim'd against as a Crime so heavy and so heinous such a Disdain or Despair of his Majesty's Mercy as was greatly to be expected could never obtain his Forgiveness Then again for Sir  Walter Ralegh  to alienate himself thus from his native Country by Means of a foreign Power was stretch'd out to the Idea of a Separation as horrid as the Breach of some huge Rock or Promontory from the main Land when its Foundation was sap'd and wash'd away by undermining Waves  The Arguments  Ralegh  now returned to extenuate this mighty Transgression having been by no Author transmitted to us it is not impossible but they were with the rest of his Justification before those Commissioners during the Time of this his last Imprisonment industriously stifled There is notwithstanding one of his own Letters on this Subject descended by Means of the Press to us It is directed by the Error of the Editor it seems to the Duke tho' as yet no more than Marquis of  Buckingham  and dated the th of  October  Herein says  Ralegh  with Relation to his late attempted Escape  That which doth comfort my Soul in this Offence is that even in the Offence it self I had no other Intent than his Majesty's Service and to make his Majesty know that my late Enterprize was grounded upon a Truth and which with one Ship speedily set out I meant to have assured  or to have died being resolved as it is well known to have done it from  Plymouth  bad I not been restrained Hereby I hoped not only to recover his Majesty's gracious Opinion but have destroyed all those malignant Reports which had been spread of me That this is true that Gentleman whom I so much trusted my  Keeper  and to whom I opened my Heart cannot but testify and wherein if I cannot be believed living my Death shall witness Yea that Gentleman cannot but avow it that when we came back towards  London  I desired to save no other Treasure than the exact  Description  of those Places in the Indies That I meant to go hence as a discontented Man God I trust and my own Actions will dissuade his Majesty whom neither the Loss of my Estate thirteen Years Imprisonment and the Denial of my Pardon could beat from his Service nor had the Opinion of being counted a Fool or rather distract by returning as I did ballanc'd with my Love to his Majesty's Person and Estate any Place at all in my Heart  It was that last severe Letter from the Lords for the speed  bringing of me up and the Impatience of Dishonour that first put me in Fear of my Life or enjoying it in a perpetual Imprisonment never to recover my Reputation lost which strengthned me in my late and too lamented Resolution if his Majesty's Merey do not abound if his Majesty do not pity my Age and scorn to take the extremest and utmost Advantage of my Errors if his Majesty in his Charity do not make a Difference between Offences proceeding from a Lifesaving natural Impulsion without all ill Intent and those of an ill Heart and that your Lordship remarkable in the World for the Nob  eness of your Disposition do not vouchsafe to become my Intercessor whereby your Lordship shall bind  an hundred Gentlemen of my Kindred to honour your Memory and bind me for all the Time of that Life which your Lordship shall beg for me to pray to God that you may ever prosper and overbind me to remain your most humble Servant  W Ralegh  Though all other Events and Motions in this Expedition were now also rack'd and tenter'd by his Adversaries though the Commissioners who were perhaps the same mention'd in a Kind of oblique Manner at the End of the King's Declaration as Witnesses thereof came now constantly to the Tower to pick out or catch hold of any Thing that might contribute some plausible Matter to condemn him yet after the Examinations Reexaminations and Confrontments of the most discontented Persons in the late Voyage none of all the Depositions upon Oath that are pretended to have been taken or were really worm'd out of them were ever thought so material by the said Commissioners as to have been distinctly brought to Light either in that Declaration or elsewhere against Sir  Walter Ralegh  Much less may we expect to meet with any of the Arguments urged by himself in his own Defence during this Inquisition or close and private Manner of sisting him from so many Quarters And yet if they had been fairly presented to the publick it is not thought they could have given the World greater Satisfaction or have cleared him better than what he had just before written both in his Letter to the Lord  Carew  and at the End of his Apology to prove the Authority he had for the late Action at  Guiana  the Integrity of his Conduct in it with the Reason and Necessity thereof Wherein it appears he absolutely depended on the Honour of King  James  to continue now as he had begun the Maintenance of his Right to that Country which  Ralegh  had  lawfully possessed for the Crown at least so far as not to renounce or circumvent his own Commission otherwise how well he knew that if he made the least Opposition to any Resistance of his Attempt he was liable to be pursued as an Invader or if he returned with any Gold to be persecuted as a Plunderer by the  Spaniards  and if he did neither that he was still no less liable to be accus'd as an Impostor by his Coadventurers But in this latter Respect all Suspicion was clearly removed even from those who by their Losses in this Voyage would have been most readily prompted to make such Reproach when they found  Ralegh  prove himself as in these Writings to the Face of Mankind such a far greater Loser than any of the rest hereby as was before observed And as for the other two Objections  Ralegh  has also made it no less amply evident in the same Pieces how glaringly he must appear to the World a mere premeditated or designed Sacrifice to one of them if King  James  should maim his Soveraignty of its Title to  Guiana  or now disclaimed the Undertaking there which he had before authorized For therein he has shewed that his Majesty was well resolved of his Right in those Parts bordering the  Orenoque  to the South as far as the  Amazons  by having formerly given the  English  Leave to plant and inhabit there and that his own Proposal to go thither was not accounted of as what would endanger the Peace even by the  Spanish  Ambassador who pretended it to be needless that  Ralegh  should carry such Strength with him if he intended no other Enterprize for that he should work any Mine there without Disturbance but had a good Reason returned by  Ralegh  for that Strength from the Example of Sir  John Hawkins  Further shewing that for the  Spaniards  to set up a Town upon the  Orenoque  was such a Usurpation and that their King should thereupon call himself King of  Guiana  was as unreasonable as if he were to call himself King of  Ireland  because he took Possession at  Smerwick  and built a Fort there Having also shewn that no Peace could be broken there by him where no Peace was maintain'd by the  Spaniards  both from their bloody Usage of the  English  who had lately been to trade there and from the Words in the King of  Spain  's late Letters to the Governor  who first call'd us Enemies when he hoped to cut us in Pieces  says  Ralegh and having fail'd Peacebreakers when to be an Enemy and a Peacebreaker in one and the same Action is impossible  Moreover that here the  Spaniards  began the first Slaughter that their Town was not burnt by any Knowledge or Permission of his nor his Directions to the Mine followed Lastly having observ'd how little the  Spaniards  can endure that the  English  Nation should look upon any Part of  America  being above a fourth Part of the whole known World tho' the hundredth Part was never possessed by the  Spaniards  and withal the many ill Consequences of acknowledging that we have offended the King of  Spain  by landing in  Guiana  even to the Ruin of our Navigation Trade Power and Dominion in this Quarter of the Globe where there was as much Room and Reason for advancing the Honour and Riches of  England  as of any State in Christendom he concludes his Apology with these Words  I have said it already and I will say it again  that if  Guiana be not his Majesty's the working of a Mine there and the taking of a Town there had been equally perilous for by doing the one I had robb'd the King of  Spain  and been a Thief and by the other a Disturber or Breaker of the Peace  Now it is plain that King  James  so much waved his right to  Guiana  at least till  Ralegh  was put to Death for then he assum'd it again by the Power he gave for another Expedition to those Parts  About a Year after the Death of Sir  Walter Ralegh  King  James  granted Captain  Roger North  a Commission to inhabit and settle a Colony near the River  Amazons  in  Guiana  but was soon aw'd by  Gondomar  so much that on the th of  May  he issued a Proclamation to recall that Gentleman from the said Undertaking▪ and committed his Brother the Lord  North  to the  Fleet  Prison for hastning the said Voyage  however irresolutely according to Custom he revok'd it that as we observe in his  Declaration  not only the place which  Ralegh  went to is pretended to be out of his Commission but the Title he stood upon to be no ways compatible with it Yet so incontestably did  Ralegh  make it appear no doubt in his Examinations at Present no less than in the Writings abovemention'd that if any Peace could be broken where no Peace had been maintain'd it must either be by King  James  himself in first granting a Commission to plunder another Prince for he knew where  Ralegh  was going and no where declines his Knowledge that the  Spaniards  were settled there and then betraying it to procure a Defeat of the very Attempt he had empower'd or else by the  Spaniards  themselves in resisting his Endeavours to put it in Execution that after all this questioning canvasing and heaping up of Allegations against him the Council could not think it justifiable to take away Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Life for all that had passed at  Guiana  Yet as he must be put to Death they found a Way to appease the  Spaniards  with his Blood by making this last Action at  St Thome  the  efficient  Cause but the obsolete Condemnation at  Winchester  fifteen Years past the  nominal  Cause of his Destruction as a  Course whereby both the Law would be judicially satisfied and the Title be left for fear of Displeasure undecided So in the whole it was resolved there should be room enough to revoke the King's former Mercy as it appears in his Declaration and that  Ralegh  might lose his Head upon his former Attainder  King  James  says  Osborne  gave up this incomparable Jewel to the Will of this Monster in Ambition the  Spaniard  under the pretence of a superannuated Transgression contrary to the Opinion of the most Honest sort of Gownmen who maintain'd that his Majesty's Pardon lay inclusively in the Commission he gave him upon his setting out to Sea It being incongruous that he who remain'd under the Notion of one dead in the Law should as a General dispose of the Lives of others not being himself Master of his own But the  Spanish  Faction then absolute at Court and sole Managers of the King's Power no less than his Justice did so far tender his Catholick Majesty's full Satisfaction in the procuring of his Death the only Man of Note left alive who had helped to beat them in the Year that no Absurdity lying in the way of his Prosecution could deter them from making Use of his former Condemnation remembring withal how far his Wit had puzzled them at  Winchester  and how much the Jury who condemn'd him there were touch'd in their Consciences which made it the less probable they should be able to Impannel one so wicked as would do it then Besides  No Peace beyond the Line  was a Belief so rivetted in the Opinion of all as he could not have been indicted anew without the King's producing the original Articles by which his Accusers would have been convinced of Malice or his Prince of Folly  Memoirs of King  James  p    notwithstanding the Repugnancies apparent in such a Conclusion to Men of Penetration among whom  Carew Ralegh  has very well observ'd thereupon that his Father was condemn'd for being a Friend to the  Spaniards  and lost his Life by the same Sentence for being their Enemy  See  Howels  Letters Vol II p and the Tract entitled  A brief Relation of Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Troubles c  where  Carew Ralegh  's Words are  p  as follows  Here Justice was indeed Blind Blindly executing one and the same Person upon one and the same Condemnation for things contradictory for Sir  Walter Ralegh  was condemn'd for being a Friend to the  Spaniard▪  and l  st his Life for being their utter Enemy Thus Kings when they wi  do what they please please not him they should God and having made their Power subservient to their Will deprive themselves of that just Power whereby where are  to them  A Method however of dispatching him being thus piec'd out the King or those with whom he left the Management of this Affair when he went upon his Progress appear'd very eager for bringing it to a Period Therefore as the shortest way a privy Seal was sent to the Judges forthwith to order Execution But they considering there ought to be some Face of Regularity in the Matter and a little Finger in the Court of Justice to slide it off with as much Decency and Smoothness as the Business would allow of demur'd upon that extrajudicial Manner of Proceeding Therefore on  Friday  the d of  October  there was a Conference held upon the Form or Manner how Prisoners who have been attainted of Treason and set at Liberty should be brought to Execution between all the Justices of  England  as one of them Judge  Hat  on  tells us wherein the Question being put  Whether a privy Seal was sufficient it being directed to the Justices of the  King'sBench  to command them to award Execution against Sir  Walter Ralegh▪  or how they should proceed before Execution be awarded  It was resolv'd by all  That he ought to be brought to the Bar  y  Hab  as Corpus  to the Lieutenant of the  Tower  and then demanded if he could say any thing why Execution should not be awarded For the Proceedings against him being before Commissioners they are deliver'd only into the Court of  King'sBench  or they might have remain'd in a Bag or a Chest and no Roll made thereof and so long Time passing it is not a legal Course that he should be commanded by a privy Seal or great Seal to be Executed without being demanded what he hath to say For he might  have a Pardon or he might say that he was not the same Person as if one be outlawed of Felony and taken he shall not be presently hang'd but he shall be brought to Bar and so demanded c Upon this Resolution a privy Seal came to the Justices of the  King'sBench  commanding them to proceed against him according to Law  In what Sense he was so proceeded against may be better understood by that Notice which on the th of  October  being the next Day  Ralegh  received from the Commissioners to prepare for Death and by his not being suffer'd when he soon after appear'd in Court before the Judges according to Law to make any Defence of himself for what had been the Occasion of his coming thither as may be seen by the following Abstract of the said Proceedings which I have been favour'd with from authentick Copies  On  Wednesday  the th of  October  Sir  Walter Ralegh  at eight o'Clock in the Morning was awaked out of a Fit of a Fever with Summons presently to appear at the  King'sBench  Bar at  Westminster  and soon after nine o'Clock he was by Writ of  Habeas Corpus  brought thither The Writ being deliver'd to the Judges by Sir  Walter Apsley  and Sir  Walter Ralegh  's Conviction at  Winchester  read the Attorney Mr  Henry Yelverton  set forth  That the Prisoner having been fifteen Years since convicted of HighTreason and then received the Judgment of Death his Majesty of his abundant Grace had been pleased to shew Mercy unto him till now that Justice calls to him for Execution Sir  Walter Ralegh  continued he hath been a Statesman and a Man who in regard to his Parts and Quality is to be pitied He hath been as a Star at which the World have gazed but Stars may fall nay they must fall when they trouble the Sphere wherein they abide It is therefore his Majesty's  Pleasure now to call for Execution of the former Judgment and I now require Order for the same  Then the Clerk of the Crown Mr  Fanshaw  having read the Record of the Conviction and Judgment the Prisoner holding up his Hand was ask'd  what he could say why Execution should not be awarded against him Ralegh  told the Lords  his Voice was grown weak by his late Sickness and an Ague he had at that Instant upon him in which he was brought thither therefore as it appears in another Copy of these Proceedings before referr'd to desired the Relief of a Pen and Ink  But the Lord Chief Justice Sir  Henry Montague  telling him  he spake audibly enough  he went on to this Effect  That he hoped the Judgment he received to die so long since could not now be strained to take away his Life since by his Majesty's Commission for his late Voyage it was imply'd to be restor'd in giving him Power as Marshal on the Life and Death of others and since he undertook the same to honour his Sovereign and enrich his Kingdom with Gold of the Ore whereof this Hand said he hath found and taken in  Guiana Then beginning to mention by what unavoidable and unblameable Means the said Enterprize miscarried the Lord Chief Justice interrupted and told him  whatever he spoke touching his Voyage was not to the Purpose also that his Commission could be of no Service to him that Treason was not pardon'd by Implication and that he must say something else to the Purpose otherwise they must proceed to give Execution Ralegh  then finding whatever he should offer in his own Justification would be no Way to the Purpose put himself upon the King's Mercy yet gave some Reasons  why he hoped the King would take Compassion upon him concerning that Judgment which was so long past in which both his Majesty was of Opinion and there were some present who  could witness that he had hard Usage  The Lord Chief Justice advised him to the Wisdom of Submission and told him  he was called to grant Execution upon the Judgment given fifteen Years since all which Time he had been as a Man dead in the Law but the King in Mercy spared him that he might think it heavy if this were done in cold Blood but it was not so for new Off  nces had stirr'd up his Majesty's Justice to revive what the Law had formerly cast upon him I know  continued he  that you have been valiant and wise and I doubt not but you retain both these Virtues for now you shall have Occasion to use them Your Faith hath heretofore been questioned but I am resolved you are a good Christian for your Book which is an admirable Work doth testify as much I would give you Counsel but I know you can apply unto yourself far better than I am able to give you  Yet with the good Neighbour in the Gospel he was for pouring some Oil into his Wounds tho' far was it from yielding the Refreshment he promised by Reason of the Severity wherewith he so sharpened the Infusion  I give you the Oil of Comfort  said he  though in Respect that I am a Minister of the Law mixed with Vinegar  Nay the Judge further gave him how unnecessary soever he just before own'd it to be one  Lecture upon Sorrow Sorrow  said he  will not avail you in some Kind for were you pained Sorrow would not ease you were you afflicted Sorrow would not relieve you were you tormented Sorrow would not content you and yet the Sorrow for your Sins would be an everlasting Comfort to you  Then another also upon  Death You must do as that valiant Captain did  said he  who perceiving himself in Danger said in Defiance of Death  Death thou expectest me but  maugre thy Spite  I expect thee  Fear not Death too much  nor fear Death too little not too much lest you fail in your Hope nor too little lest you die presumptuously and here I must conclude my Prayers to God for it and that he would have Mercy on your Soul  So he ended with saying  Execution is granted  Ralegh  then desir'd that he might not be cut off so suddenly for that he had something to do in Discharge of his Conscience something to satisfy his Majesty and something the World in he desir'd further that he might be heard at the Day of his Death and concluded with calling on  God to be his Judge before whom he should shortly appear that he was never disloyal to his Majesty which I will justify said he where I shall not fear the Face of any King on Earth  Thus the Manuscripts here chiefly followed conclude but in the more ancient Copy of these Proceedings  Ralegh  's Conclusion to the same Sense is thus more copiously express'd  I most humbly beseech your Lordships that you will grant me some Time before my Execution that I may settle my Affairs and my Mind more than they yet are for I have much to do both for my Reputation Conscience and Loyalty and I would beseech the Favour of Pen Ink and Paper to express myself something thereby and to discharge myself of some Trust of worldly Matters that were put in me which Leisure I beseech you think that I crave not for to gain one Minute of Life for now being old sickly in Disgrace and certain to go to it Life is wearisome to me And I do lastly beseech your Lordships that when I come to die I may have Leave to speak freely at my Farewell to satisfy the World only that I was ever loyal to the King and a true Lover of this Commonwealth for this I will seal with my Blood  So craving their Prayers he was led away to the  Gatehouse  near the  Palaceyard  The King was all this while retir'd as it were or at some Remoteness from this tragical Scene and as I have receiv'd it from particular Tradition in  Hertfordshire  as if he would have diverted himself not only from the Sight or Report but even the Thoughts of it yet what an effectual and expeditious Hand he had in it may further appear by his special Warrant for the Execution which was produced ready sign'd as if it at  Westminster  in a Manner as soon as the Sentence was over being dated the same Day and directed to his Chancellor  Verulam  Herein his gracious Majesty  dispensing with the Manner of Execution according to his former Judgment and releasing him of the same to be drawn hang'd and quarter'd says our Pleasure is instead thereof to have the Head only of the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  cut off at or within our Palace of  Westminster  commanding the said Chancellor hereupon to direct two several Writs under the Great Seal one to the Lieutenant of the Tower or his Deputy for the Delivery of Sir  Walter Ralegh  to the Sheriffs of  Middlesex  at the said Palace and the other to the said Sheriffs for the receiving the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  from the said Lieutenant and for executing him there for which this to be his Warrant and Discharge against us our Heirs and Successors for ever  We find about the same Time some Petitions presented to the King in Behalf of Sir  Walter Ralegh  which were strengthened with the Solicitations of some Persons in great Power and Esteem with his Majesty but shall not wonder at their having no Effect with him to mitigate this peremptory and rigorous Doom if it be true as an Author who had Opportunity enough of observing his Disposition and Abilities sufficient to give a clear  Judgment of it has said thereof with Relation to Sir  Walter Ralegh  that  King  James  so far participated of the Humour of a pusillanimous Prince as to pardon any sooner that those injur'd by himself  As for  Ralegh  we find not that he harbour'd the least Expectation or Desire of a Reprieve for that all the Oppressions of Age Sickness Obloquy Spoil and Loss of all his Means besides the other Indignities he now lay under banish'd every Wish of Redress in this World but by that Dissolution which puts an End to all worldly Miseries appears pretty evident in the Letter he seems to have written but a short Time before his Death to the King in which he rather acknowledges some former Tendencies to Favour and Compassion than desires any Repetition of them and gives a very good Reason for having no further Prospect of any Thing substantial therein where he says  I have not spared my Labour my poor Estate and the hourly Hazard of my Life but God hath otherwise disposed of all and now end the Days of my Hope  But if the Days of his Hope had ended when he landed at  Plymouth  the Days of his Life had probably been augmented to a much greater Number Not if it had been prolonged into many other Acts that they might have adorn'd it with such unfading Renown as that one whereby with such universal Admiration he finished it That Letter aforesaid he concludes with the generous Profession of  being in nothing so miserable as in that I could never meet with an Occasion  says he  wherein to be torn in Pieces for your Majesty's Service  But his Majesty chose rather to let his own Name and Memory be torn in Pieces for  Ralegh  's Honour and not only by all indifferent or impartial Judges  but by his own Countrymen  Bishop  Burnet  speaking of some great Errors in King  James  's Reign goes on thus  Besides these publick Actings King  James  suffer'd much in the Opinion of all People by his strange Way of using one of the greatest Men of that Age Sir  Walter Ralegh  against whom the Proceedings at first were much censured but the last Part of them was thought both barbarous and illegal  A little further speaking of the same King he says  His Reign in  England  was a continual Course of mean Practices The first Condemnation of Sir  Walter Ralegh  was very black but the executing him after so many Yrars and after an Employment that had been given him was counted a barbarous sacrificing him to the  Spaniards History of his own Times  Vol  fol and  and even by Antagonists to one another in other Parts of History than suffer any Mercy to interfere with that sordid but deceitful and soon after derided Pursuit of a profitable Alliance with the Crown of  Spain  Whether any such Conditions were offer'd him at this Time to lengthen the short Line of an uncomfortable Existence which were either so extortionate as  Ralegh  could not comply with them or so base and detestable as to be worse than Death the Particulars are not come to Light unless some Glimpses thereof may be discerned in that Epigram he wrote a little while before his End in Allusion to the Light of a Candle which is as follows  Cowards may fear to die but Courage stout  Rather than live in  Snuff  will be  put out  Moreover how sublimely his Thoughts were now sequester'd or elevated from all worldly Considerations and with what Serenity what Steadiness he did in a Manner possess the Joys of a better State before he could be driven to it is visible in that Poem he wrote about the same Time on the Pilgrimage his Soul was suddenly to make to  the Regions of Eternity which he concludes with this Distich  Of Death and Judgment Heaven and Hell  Who often thinks must needs die well  And that his Faith was no less stedfast in the Hopes of a Resurrection we are as convincingly assured by those Verses which this last Night of his Life he probably wrote also here in the  Gatehouse  they being found there in his Bible and according to the most ancient Copies I can meet with penn'd in these Words  Even such is  Time  who takes in Trust  Our Youth our Joys and all we have  And pays us but with Earth and Dust  Who in the dark and silent Grave  When we have wander'd all our Ways  Shuts up the Story of our Days  But from that Earth that Grave and Dust  The Lord shall raise me up I trust  The next Morning being  Thursday  the th of  October  and the  LordMayor'sDay  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was conducted by the Sheriffs of  Middlesex  to the Old  Palaceyard  in  Westminster  where there was a large Scaffold erected before the  Parliamenthouse  for his Execution He had on a wrought Nightcap under his Hat a Ruff Band a black wrought Velvet NightGown over a Haircolour'd Sattin Doublet and a black wrought Waistcoat a Pair of black cut Taffety Breeches and Ashcolour'd Silk Stockings He mounted the Scaffold with a chearful Countenance and saluted the Lords Knights and Gentlemen of his Acquaintance there present Then Proclamation  being made by an Officer for Silence he introduc'd his Speech with informing them that as he was yesterday taken out of his Bed in a strong Fit of a Fever which much weaken'd him and whose Untimeliness forbearing no Occasion or Place he expected it again Today therefore did first implore God that he would preserve him from the Interruptions thereof at this Time and next desired the Audience if any Disability of Voice or Dejection of Countenance should appear in him that they would impute it rather to the Disorder of his Body than any Dismay of Mind Then pausing a little he sat down and directed himself towards a Window where the Lords  Arundel Northampton Doncaster  with other Nobles were sitting and begun his Speech But they being at some Distance from the Scaffold he apprehended they did not plainly distinguish his Words therefore said he would strain his Voice for that he would willingly have them hear him To which the Lord  Arundel  answer'd they would rather come down to the Scaffold which he and some others did Then Sir  Walter Ralegh  having saluted them severally began again as follows  I thank God that he has sent me to die in the Light and not in Darkness I likewise thank God that he has suffer'd me to die before such an Assembly of honourable Witnesses and not obscurely in the  Tower  where for the Space of thirteen Years together I have been oppress'd with many Miseries And I return him Thanks that my Fever hath not taken me at this Time as I prayed to him it might not that I might clear myself of some Accusations unjustly laid to my Charge and leave behind me the Testimony of a true Heart both to my King and Country  There are two main Points of Suspicion that his Majesty hath conceived against me and which I conceive have specially hastned my coming hither therefore I desire to clear them to your Lordships and resolve you in the Truth thereof The first is that his Majesty hath been inform'd I have had some Plot or Confederacy with  France  for which he had some reasons tho' grounded upon a weak Foundation One was that when I return'd to  Plymouth  I endeavoured to go to  Rochel  which was because I would fain have made my Peace before I came to  England  Another Reason was that again I would have bent my Course to  France  upon my last intended Escape from  London  being the Place where I might have the best Means of making such Peace and the best Safeguard during that Terror from above These join'd with the coming of the  French  Agent to my House here in  London  only to confer about my said Voyage together with the report of my having a Commission from the King of  France  might occasion my being so suspected in this particular and his Majesty to be so displeased with me But this I say for a Man to call God to Witness at any Time to a Falshood is a grievous Sin To call him as Witness to a Falshood at the Point of Death when there is no Time for Repentance is a Crime far more impious and desperate therefore for me to call that Majesty to witness an Untruth before whose Tribunal I am instantly to appear were beyond Measure sinful and without Hope of Pardon I do yet call that great God to witness that as I hope to see him to be saved by him and live in the World to come I never had any Plot or Intelligence with the  French  King never had any Commission from him nor saw his Hand or Seal that I never had any Practice or Combination with the  French  Agent nor ever knew or saw such a Person till I met him in my Gallery unlook'd  for If I speak not true O Lord let me never inter into thy Kingdom  The second Suspicion or Imputation was that his Majesty hath been informed I had spoken disloyally of him The only Witness of this was a base  Frenchman  a Renegade a chymical Fellow whom I soon knew to be perfidious for being drawn by him into the Action of freeing myself at  Winchester  in which I confess my Hand was touch'd he being sworn to Secrecy overnight revealed it the next Morning 'Tis strange that so mean a Fellow could so far incroach himself into the Favour of the Lords and gaping after some great Reward could so falsly accuse me of seditious Speeches against his Majesty and be so credited But this I here speak it is no Time for me to flatter or to fear Princes I who am subject only unto Death and for me who have now to do with God alone to tell a Lye to get the Favour of the King were in vain And yet if ever I spake disloyally or dishonestly of the King either to this  Frenchman  or any other ever intimated the least Thought hurtful or prejudicial of him the Lord blot me out of the Book of Life  I confess I did attempt to escape and it was only to save my Life I likewise confess that I feigned myself to be indisposed at  Salisbury  but I hope it was no Sin for the Prophet  David  did make himself a Fool and suffer'd Spittle to fall upon his Beard to escape from the Hands of his Enemies and it was not imputed unto him as a Sin what I did was only to prolong Time till his Majesty came in Hopes of some Commiseration from him  But I forgive that  Frenchman  and likewise Sir  Lewis Stucley  the Wrongs he hath done me with all my Heart for I have received the Sacrament this Morning of Mr  Dean  and I have forgiven all Men  but in Charity to others am bound to caution them against him and such as he is For Sir  Lewis Stucley  my Keeper and Kinsman hath affirmed that I should tell him my Lord  Carew  and my Lord of  Doncaster  here did advise me to escape but I protest before God I never told him any such Thing neither did these Lords advise me to any such Matter It is not likely I should acquaint two Privy Counsellors of my Escape or that I should tell him my Keeper it was their Advice neither was there any Reason to tell it him or he to report it for it was well known he left me six eight or ten Days together alone to go whither I listed while he rode about the Country He further accus'd me that I should shew him a Letter whereby I did signify that I would give him ten thousand Pounds to escape but God cast my Soul into everlasting Fire if ever I made such Proffer of ten thousand Pounds or one thousand Pounds but indeed I shewed him a Letter that if he would go with me there should be Order taken for the Discharge of his Debts when he was gone neither had I one thousand Pounds for if I had I could have made my Peace better with it otherwise than by giving it  Stucley  Further he gave out when I came to Sir  Edward Parham  's House who had been a Follower of mine and gave me good Entertainement I had there received some Dram of Poison When I answer'd that I feared no such Thing for I was well assur'd of those in the House and therefore wished him to have no such Thought Now I will not only say that God is the God of Revenge but also of Mercy and I desire God to forgive him as I hope to be forgiven  Then casting his Eye upon his Note of Remembrance he went on thus  It was told the King that I was brought perforce into  England  and that I did not intend to return again Whereas Captain  Charles Parker  Mr  Tresham  Mr  Leak  and divers others that knew how I was dealt withal by the common Soldiers will witness to the contrary They were an hundred and fifty of them who mutiny'd against me and sent for me to come to them for unto me they would not come They kept me close Prisoner in my Cabbin and forced me to take an Oath that I would not go into  England  without their Consent otherwise they would have cast me into the Sea After I had taken this Oath I did by Wine Gifts and fair Words so work upon the Mastergunner and ten or twelve of the Faction that I won them to desist from their Purposes and intended when I returned home to procure their Pardon in the mean while proposed that I would dispose of some of them in  Ireland  to which they agreed and would have gone into the North Parts from which I dissuaded them and told them they were  Redshanks  who inhabited there so drew them to the South and the better to clear myself of them was forced to get them an hundred and fifty Pounds at  Kingsale  otherwise I had never got from them  There was a Report also that I meant not to go to  Guiana  at all and that I knew not of any Mine nor intended any such Matter but only to get my Liberty which I had not the Wit to keep But it was my full Intent to go for Gold for the Benefit of his Majesty myself and those who went with me with the Rest of my Countrymen tho' he that knew the Head of the Mine would not discover it when he saw my Son was slain but made himself away  Then turning to the Earl of  Arundel  he said  My Lord you being in the Gallery of my Ship at my Departure I remember you took me by the Hand and said you would request one Thing of me which was whether I made a good Voyage or a bad that I would return again into  England  which I then promis'd and gave you  my Faith I would So you did said his Lordship 'tis true and they were the last Words I said to you Another slander was raised of me that I should have gone away from them and have left them at  Guiana  but there were a great many worthy Men who accompanied me always as my Serjeantmajor and divers others whom he nam'd that knew it was none of my Intention Also it hath been said that I stinted them of fresh Water to which I answer every one was as they must be in a Ship furnish'd by Measure and not according to their Appetites This Course all Seamen know must be used among them and to this Straight were we driven Another Opinion was held that I carried with me sixteen thousand Pieces of Gold and that all the Voyage I intended was but to gain my Liberty and this Money into my Hands But as I shall answer it before God I had no more in all the World directly or indirectly than one hundred Pounds whereof I gave about fortyfive Pounds to my Wife But the Ground of this false Report was that twenty thousand Pounds being adventured and but four thousand appearing in the Surveyor's Books the Rest had my Hand to the Bills for divers Adventures but as I hope to be sav'd I had not a Penny more than one hundred Pounds These are the material Points I thought good to speak of I am at this Instant to render my Account to God and I protest as I shall appear before him this that I have spoken is true  I will borrow but a little Time more of Mr  Sheriff  that I may not detain him too long and herein I shall speak of the Imputation laid upon me through the Jealousy of the People that I had been a Persecutor of my Lord of  Essex  that I rejoiced in his Death and stood in a Window overagainst him when he suffer'd and puff'd out Tobacco in Defiance of him when as God is my Witness that I shed Tears for  him when he denied and as I hope to look God in the Face hereafter my Lord of  Essex  did not see my Face at the Time of his Death for I was far off in the Armory where I saw him but he saw not me 'Tis true I was of a contrary Faction but I take the same God to witness that I had no Hand in his Death nor bare him any ill Affection but always believed it would be better for me that his Life had been preserved for after his Fall I got the Hatred of those who wished me well before and those who set me against him set themselves afterwards against me and were my greatest Enemies And my Soul hath many Times been grieved that I was not nearer to him when he died because as I understood afterwards he asked for me at his Death and desired to have been reconciled to me  And now I entreat that you all will join with me in Prayer to that great God of Heaven whom I have grievously offended being a Man full of all Vanity who has lived a sinful Life in such Callings as have been most inducing to it for I have been a Soldier a Sailor and a Courtier which are courses of Wickedness and Vice that his Almighty Goodness will forgive me that he will cast away my Sins from me and that he will receive me into everlasting Life So I take my leave of you all making my Peace with God  Then Proclamation being made that all Men should depart the Scaffold he prepared himself for Death giving away his Hat and Gap and Money to some Attendants who stood near him When he took leave of the Lords and other Gentlemen he intreated the Lord  Arundel  to desire the King that no scandalous Writings to defame him might be publish'd after his Death Concluding  I have a long Journey to go therefore must take my leave  Then having put off his Gown and Doublet he call'd to the Headsman to shew him the Ax which not being suddenly done he said  I pr'ythee let me see it Dost thou think that I am afraid of it  Having finger'd the Edge of it a little he return'd it and said smiling to the Sheriff  This is a sharp Medicine but it is a sound Cure for all Diseases  and having intreated the Company to pray to God to assist and strengthen him the Executioner kneeled down and asked him Forgiveness which  Ralegh  laying his Hand upon his Shoulder granted Then being asked which way he would lay himself on the Block he answer'd  So the Heart be right it is no Matter which way the Head lies  As he stoop'd to lay himself along and reclined his Head his Face being towards the East the Headsman spread his own Cloak under him After a little Pause he gave the Sign that he was ready for the Stroke by lifting up his Hand and his Head was struck off at two Blows his Body never shrinking or moving His Head was shew'd on each side of the Scaffold and then put into a red Leather Bag and with his Velvet Nightgown thrown over it was afterwards conveyed away in a Mourning Coach of his Lady's His Body as we are told was buried hard by in the Chancel of St  Margaret  's Church near the Altar but his Head was long preserved in a Case by his Widow for she survived him twentynine Years as I have found by some Anecdotes remaining in the Family and after her Death it was kept also by her Son  Carew  with whom it is said to have been Buried  Thus have we seen how Sir  Walter Ralegh  after a shining and conspicuous Series of Actions against the Enemies of his Country and for the Improvement of Navigation as well as the Enlargement and  Enrichment of the  British  Empire under one Soveraign was deprived of his Liberty his Estate and his Life under another how Sir  Walter Ralegh  who had been one of the greatest Scourges of  Spain  was made a Sacrifice to it how the Services of Sir  Walter Ralegh  I say in Camp in Court by Land by Sea with Sword and Pen were an Honour to Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign and how his Sufferings at  Winchester  at  Westminster  by Imprisonment by Law with Slander and the Ax were the Disgrace of King  James  's Writers vary in their Accounts of his Age but the most credible Historians inform us that he was sixtysix Years Old at his Execution Yet was it conjectured by the extraordinary Effusion of Blood from his Veins that he had Stock and Strength enough left of Nature to have survived many Yaars  His Death was managed by him as one Author has observed with so high and religious a Resolution as if a  Roman  had acted a  Christian  or rather a  Christian  a  Roman And this is confirm'd by Sir  Richard Hutton  's Evidence who says  He died in a good and religious Manner spake much and without any Fear of Death submitted himself to the Block by his Death he gained great Reputation in this Life and by the Grace and Mercy of God Remission of his Sins and Eternal Life hereafter  And now since it is Time to close the Scene  Let this glorious and gallant Cavalier whose Enemies have confess'd he was one of the weightiest and wisest Men that this Island ever bred rest in his Grave and may his Virtues live in Posterity  whom to inspire therewith the Felicities of Commemoration however here disposed of seem to have signally combin'd having transmitted many ample Testimonies how emulous the Harmony of Record and the Spirit of Communication have been  to restore those Honours to his Memory which were torn from his Person and make Historical Compensation for such honourable Calamities and that so early that from this speedy Growth of his Fame through his extraordinary Merits and Misfortunes the learned and judicious Mr  Nathanael Carpenter  who wrote but few Years after his Death drew that comprehensive Character which has so much engaged the Concurrence of all succeeding Writers where he says  Who hath not known or read of that Prodigy of Wit and Fortune Sir  Walter Ralegh  A Man unfortunate in nothing else but in the greatness of his Wit and Advancement Whose eminent Worth was such both in domestick Policy foreign Expeditions and Discoveries in Arts and Literature both Practic and Contemplative that it might seem at once to conquer both Example and Imitation  But lest a private Judgment should be suspected more liable to the Ignorance of a Stranger or the Affection of a Friend and that there may be no room left to doubt either of such manifold Worth in Sir  Walter Ralegh  or that it was all made a Sacrifice of State to the Enemies and Deceivers of the State we have reserved as most convincing the Acknowledgments of an Enemy who made him that Sacrifice here to conclude with For King  James  soon after  Ralegh  's Execution beginning to see how he was and would be deluded by the  Spaniard  made one of his Ministers write to h s Agent in  Spain  to let that State know they should be look'd upon as the most unworthy People in the World if they did not now act with Sincerity since his Majesty had given so many Testimonies of his and now of late by causing Sir  Walter Ralegh  to be put to Death chiefly for the giving them Satisfaction Further to let them see how in many Actions of late his Majesty had  strained upon the Affections of his People and especially in this last concerning Sir  Walter Ralegh  who died with a great deal of Courage and Constancy Lastly that he should let them know how able a Man Sir  Walter Ralegh  was to have done his Majesty Service Yet to give them Content he hath not spared him when by preserving him he might have given great Satisfaction to his Subjects and had at Command upon all Occasions as useful a Man as served any Prince in  Christendom  THE TRIAL OF Sir  Walter Ralegh  Kt FOR  HIGH TREASON  At  Winton  the    th of  November  JAC I  The COMMISSIONERS were  The Right Hon  Henry Howard  Earl of  Suffolk  Ld Chamberlain  Charles Blunt  Earl of  Devon  Lord  Henry Howard  afterward Earl of  Northampton  Robert Cecil  Earlof  Salisbury  Edward  Lord  Wotton  of  Morley  Sir  John Stanhope  ViceChamberlain  Ld Ch Just of  Eng Popham  Ld Chief Justice of the  CommonPleas Anderson  Mr Justice  Gawdie  Mr Justice  Warburton  and  Sir  William Wade  _FIRST The Commission of  Oyer  and  Terminer  was read by the Clerk of the CrownOff  ce and the Prisoner bid hold up his Hand  And then presently the Indictment which was in Effect as followeth  THAT he did conspire and go about to deprive the King of his Government to raise up Sedition within the Realm to alter Religion to bring in the Roman Superstition and to procure foreign Enemies to invade the Kingdom That the Lord  Cobham  the  th of  June  last did meet with the said Sir  Walter Ralegh  in  Durham  House in the Parish of  St Martin's in the Fields  and then and there had Conference with him how to advance  Arabella Stuart  to the Crown and royal Throne of this Kingdom and that then and there it was agreed That  Cobham  should treat with  Aremberg  Ambassador from the ArchDuke of  Austria  to obtain of him    Crowns to bring to pass their intended Treasons It was agreed That  Cobham  should go to  Albert  the Archduke to procure him to advance the pretended Title of  Arabella  From thence knowing that  Albert  had not sufficient Means to maintain his own Army in the  LowCountries Cobham  should go to  Spain  to procure the King to assist and further her pretended Title  It was agreed the better to effect all this Conspiracy That  Arabella  should write three Letters one to the Archduke another to the King of  Spain  and a third to the Duke of  Savoy  and promise three Things  First  To establish a firm Peace between  England  and  Spain Secondly  To tolerate the  Popish  and  Roman  Superstition  Thirdly  To be ruled by them in contracting of her Marriage  And for the effecting these traiterous Purposes  Cobham  should return by the Isle of  Jersey  and should there find Sir  Walter Ralegh  Captain of the said Isle and take Counsel of  Ralegh  for the distributing of the aforesaid Crowns as the Occasion or Discontentment of the Subjects should give Cause and Way  And further That  Cobham  and his Brother  Brook  met on the    th of  June  last and  Cobham  told  Brook  all these Treasons To the which Treasons  Brook  gave his Assent and did join himself to all these and after on the  Thursday  following  Cobham  and  Brook  did speak these Words  That there would never be a good World in  England  till the King  meaning our Sovereign Lord  and his Cubs  meaning his Royal Issue  were taken away  And the more to disable and deprive the King of his Crown and to confirm the said  Cobham  in his Intents  Ralngh  did publish a Book falsly written against the most just and Royal Title of the King knowing the said Book to be written against the just Title of the King which Book  Cobham  after that received of him Farther for the better effecting these traiterous Purposes and to establish the said  Brook  in his Intent the said  Cobham  did deliver the said Book unto him the    th of  June  And further the said  Cobham  on the    th of  June  for Accomplishment of the said Conference and by the traiterous Instigation of  Ralegh  did move  Brook  to incite  Arabella  to write to the three forenamed Princes to procure them to advance her Title and that she after she had obtained the Crown should promise to perform three Things  viz  Peace between  England  and  Spain  To tolerate with Impunity the  Popish  and  Roman  Superstitions    To be ruled by them three in the contracting of her Marriage  To these Motions the said  Brook  gave his Assent and for the better effecting of the said Treasons  Cobham  on the    th of  June  by the Instigation of  Ralegh  did write Letters to Count  Aremberg  and did deliver the said Letters to one  Matthew de Lawrency  to be delivered to the said Count which he did deliver for the obtaining of    Crowns which Money by other Letters Count  Aremberg  did promise to perform the Payment of and this Letter  Cobham  received the    th of  June  And then did  Cobham  promise to  Ralegh  that when he had received the said Money he would deliver    Crowns to him to which Motion he did consent and afterwards  Cobham  offered  Brook  that after he should receive the said Crowns he would give to him    thereof to which Motion  Brook  did assent  To the Indictment Sir  Walter Ralegh  pleaded Not guilty  The JURY  Sir  Ralph Conisby  Knt  Sir  Thomas Fowler  Knt  Sir  Edward Peacock  Knt  Sir  William Rowe  Knt  Henry Goodyer  Esq  Roger Wood  Esq  Thomas Walker  Esq  Thomas Whitby  Esq  Thomas Highgate  Gent  Robert Kempthorn  Gent  John Chawkey  Gent  Robert Brumley  Gent  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was asked whether he would take Exceptions to any of the Jury  Ralegh  I know none of them they are all Christians and honest Gentlemen I except against none  E  Suff  You Gentlemen of the King's learned Council follow the same Course as you did the other Day  Ralegh  My Lord I pray you▪ I may answer the Points particularly as they are delivered by Reason of the Weakness of my Memory and Sickness  Popham Chief Justice  After the King's learned Council have delivered all the Evidence Sir  Walter  you may answer particularly to what you will  Heale the King's Serjeant at Law  You have heard of  Ralegh  's bloody Attempts to kill the King and his royal Progeny and in Place thereof to advance one  Arabella Stuart  The Particulars of the Indictment are these  First  That  Ralegh  met with  Cobham  the th of  June  and had Conference of an Invasion of a Rebellion and an Insurrection to be made by the King's Subjects to depose  the King and to kill his Children poor Babes that never gave Offence Here is Blood here is a new King and Governor In our King consists all our Happiness and the true Use of the Gospel a Thing which we all wished to be setled after the Death of the Queen Here must be Money to do this for Money is the Sinew of War Where should that be had Count  Aremberg  must procure it of  Philip  King of  Spain  or Crowns and out of this Sum  Ralegh  must have then there must be Friends to effect this  Cobham  must go to  Albert  ArchDuke of  Austria  from whom  Aremberg  was Ambassador at that Time in  England  And what then He must persuade the Duke to assist the pretended Title of  Arabella  From thence  Cobham  must go to the King of  Spain  and persuade him to assist the said Title Since the Conquest there was never the like Treason But out of whose Head came it Out of  Ralegh  's who must also advise  Cobham  to use his Brother  Brook  to incite the Lady  Arabella  to write three several Letters as aforesaid in the Indictment all this was on the th of  June  Then three Days after  Brook  was acquainted with it After this  Cobham  said to  Brook  'Twill never be well in  England  till the King and his Cubs are taken away Afterwards  Ralegh  delivered a Book to  Cobham  treacherously written against the Title of the King It appears that  Cobham  took  Ralegh  to be either a God or an Idol  Gobham  endeavours to set up a new King or Governor God forbid mine Eyes should ever see so unhappy a Change As for the Lady  Arabella  she upon my Conscience hath no more Title to the Crown than I have which before God I utterly renounce  Cobham  a Man bred in  England  hath no Experience abroad But  Ralegh  a Man of great Wit Military and a Swordman Now whether these Things were bred in a hollow  Tree I leave to them to speak of who can speak far better than myself  Sir  Edward Coke the King's Attorney  I must first My Lords before I come to the Cause give one Caution because we shall often mention Persons of eminent Places some of them great Monarchs Whatever we say of them we shall but repeat what others have said of them I mean the capital Offenders in their Confessions We prosessing Law must speak reverently of Kings and Potentates I perceive these honourable Lords and the rest of this great Assembly are come to hear what hath been scattered upon the Wreck of Report We carry a just Mind to condemn no Man but upon plain Evidence Here is Mischief Mischief  in summo gradu  exorbitant Mischief My Speech shall chiefly touch these three Points Imitation Supportation and Defence  The Imitation of Evil ever exceeds the Precedent as on the contrary Imitation of Good ever comes short Mischief cannot be supported but by Mischief Yea it will so multiply that it will bring all to Confusion Mischief is ever underprop'd by Falshood of foul Practices And because all these Things did concur in these Treasons you shall understand the Main as before you did the Bye  The Treason of the Bye consisteth in these Points  First  That the Lord  Grey Brook Markham  and the rest intended by Force in the Night to surprize the King's Court which was a Rebellion in the Heart of the Realm yea in the Heart of the Heart in the Court They intended to make him that is a Sovereign subject to their Power purposing to open the Doors with Musquets and Calivers and to take also the Prince and Council Then under the King's Authority to carry the King to the  Tower  and to make a  State of the Admiral  When they had the King there to extort three  Things from him  First  A Pardon for all their Treasons  Secondly  A Toleration of the  Roman  Superstition Which their Eyes shall sooner fall out than they shall ever see for the King hath spoken these Words in the hearing of many  I will lose the Crown and my Life before ever I will alter Religion  And  Thirdly  To remove Counsellors In the Room of the Lord Chancellor they would have placed one  Watson  a Priest absurd in Humanity and ignorant in Divinity  Brook  of whom I will speak nothing Lord Treasurer the great Secretary must be  Markham Oculus Patriae  A Hole must be found in my Lord Chief Justice's Coat  Grey  must be Earl Marshal and Master of the Horse because he would have a Table in the Court Marry he would advance the Earl of  Worcester  to a higher Place All this cannot be done without a Multitude Therefore  Watson  the Priest telleth a resolute Man That the King was in Danger of Puritans and Jesuits so to bring him in Blindfold into the Action saying That the King is no King till he be crown'd therefore every Man might right his own Wrongs But he is  Rex Natus  his Dignity descends as well as yours my Lords Then  Watson  imposeth a blasphemous Oath that they should swear to defend the King's Person to keep secret what was given them in Charge and seek all Ways and Means to advance the Catholick Religion Then they intend to send for the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen in the King's Name to the  Tower  lest they should make any Resistance and then to take Hostages of them and to enjoin them to provide for them Victuals and Munition  Grey  because the King removed before  Midsummer  had a further Reach to get a Company of Sword▪men to assist the Action Therefore he would stay till he had obtain'd a Regiment from  Ostend  or  Austria  So you see these Treasons were like  Sampson  's Foxes  which were joined in their Tails tho' their Heads were sever'd  Ralegh  You Gentlemen of the Jury I pray remember I am not charged with the Bye being the Treason of the Priest  Attorney  You are not My Lords you shall observe three Things in the Treasons  First  They had a WatchWord the King's Safety their Pretence was  Bonum in se  their Intent was  Malum in se Secondly  They avouched Scripture both the Priests had  Scriptum est  perverting and ignorantly mistaking the Scriptures  Thirdly  They avouched the Common Law to prove That he was no King till he was crowned alledging a Statute of  Eliz  This by Way of Imitation hath been the Course of all Traytors  In the th of  Edward  II  Isabella  the Queen and the Lord  Mortimer  gave out That the King's Person was not safe for the Good of the Church and Commonwealth  The Bishop of  Carlisle  did preach on this Text  My Head is grieved  meaning by the Head the King that when the Head began to be negligent the People might reform what is amifs  In the d of  Henry  IV Sir  Roger Claringdon  accompanied with two Priests gave out that  Richard  II was alive when he was dead  Edward  III caused  Mortimer  's Head to be cut off for giving Couusel to murther the King  The d of  Henry  VII Sir  Henry Stanley  found the Crown in the Dust and set it on the King's Head When  Fitzwater  and  Garret  told him that  Edward  V was alive he said  If he be alive I will assist him  But this cost him his Head  Edmund de la Pole  Duke of  Suffolk  killed a Man in the Reign of King  Henry  VII for which the King would have him hold up his Hand at the Bar and then pardoned him Yet he took such Offence  thereat that he sent to the Noblemen to help to reform the Commonwealth and then said he would go to  France  and get Power there Sir  Roger Compton  knew all the Treason and discovered  Windon  and others that were attainted  He said there was another Thing that would be stood upon namely that they had but one Witness then he vouched one  Appleyard  's Case  Temp Eliz  a Traytor in  Norfolk  who said a Man must have two Accusers  Helmes  was the Man that accused him but Mr Justice  Catlin  said that that Statute was not in Force at that Day his Words were  Thrust her into the Ditch  Then he went on speaking of Accusers and mad  this Difference An Accuser is a Speaker by Report when a Witness is he that upon his Oath shall speak his Knowledge of any Man  A third Sort of Evidence there is likewise and this is held more forcible than either of the other two and that is when a Man by his Accusation of another shall by the same Accusation also condemn himself and make himself liable to the same Fault and Punishment This is more forcible than many Witnesses So then so much by Way of Imitation Then he defined Treason There is Treason in the Heart in the Hand in the Mouth in Consummation comparing that  in Corde  to the Root of a Tree  in Ore  to the Bud  in Manu  to the Blossom and that which is  in Consummatione  to the Fruit  Now I come to your Charge you of the Jury The Greatness of Treason is to be considered in these two Things  Determinatione finis  and  Electione medicorum  This Treason excelleth in both for that it was to destroy the King and his Progeny These Treasons are said to be  Crimen laesae Majestatis  this goeth farther and may be termed  Crimen extirpandae Regiae Majestatis totius Progeniei  suae  I shall not need my Lords to speak any Thing concerning the King nor of the Bounty and Sweetness of his Nature whose Thoughts are innocent whose Words are full of Wisdom and Learning and whose Works are full of Honour although it be a true Saying  Nunquam nimis quod nunquam satis  But to whom do you bear Malice To the Children  Ralegh  To whom speak you this You tell me News I never heard of  Attorney  Oh Sir do I I will prove you the notoriousest Traytor that ever came to the Bar After you have taken away the King you would alter Religion As you Sir  Walter Ralegh  have followed them of the Bye in Imitation for I will charge you with the Words  Ralegh  Your Words cannot condemn me my Innocency is my Defence Prove one of these Things wherewith you have charged me and I will confess the whole Indictment and that I am the horriblest Traytor that ever lived and worthy to be crucified with a thousand thousand Torments  Attorney  Nay I will prove all Thou art a Monster thou hast an  English  Face but a  Spanish  Heart Now you must have Money  Aremberg  was no sooner in  England  I charge thee  Ralegh  but thou incitedst  Cobham  to go unto him and to deal with him for Money to bestow on discontented Persons to raise Rebellion in the Kingdom  Ralegh  Let me answer for myself  Attorney  Thou shalt not  Ralegh  It concerneth my Life  Lord Chief Justice Popham  Sir  Walter Ralegh  Mr  Attorney  is but yet in the General but when the King's Council have given the Evidence wholly you shall answer every Particular  Attorney  Oh do I touch you  Lord Cecil  Mr  Attorney  when you have done with this general Charge do you not mean to let him answer to every Particular  Attorney  Yes when we deliver the Proofs to be read  Ralegh  procured  Cobham  to go to  Aremberg  which he did by his Instigation  Ralegh  supped with  Cobham  before he went to  Aremberg  after Supper  Ralegh  conducted him to  Durham  House from whence  Cobham  went with  Lawrency  a Servant of  Aremberg  's unto him and went in by a Backway  Cobham  could never be quiet until he had entertain'd this Motion for he had four Letters from  Ralegh Aremberg  answered the Money should be performed but knew not to whom it should be distributed Then  Cobham  and  Lawrency  came back to  Durham  House where they found  Ralegh Cobham  and  Ralegh  went up and left  Lawrency  below where they had secret Conference in a Gallery and after  Cobham  and  Lawrency  departed from  Ralegh  Your Jargon was Peace What is that  Spanish  Invasion  Scotish  Subversion And again you are not a fit Man to take so much Money for procuring of a lawful Peace for Peace procured by Money is dishonourable Then  Cobham  must go to  Spain  and return by  Jersey  where you were Captain And then because  Cobham  had not so much Policy or at least Wickedness as you he must have your Advice for the Distribution of the Money Would you have deposed so good a King lineally descended of  Elizabeth  eldest Daughter of  Edward  IV Why then must you set up another I think you meant to make  Arabella  a titular Queen of whose Title I will speak nothing but sure you meant to make her a Stale Ah good Lady you could mean her no good  Ralegh  You tell me News Mr  Attorney  Attorney  Oh Sir I am the more large because I know with whom I deal For we have to deal today with a Man of Wit  Ralegh  Did I ever speak with this Lady  Attorney  I will track you out before I have done  Englishmen  will not be led by Persuasion of Words but they must have Books to persuade  Ralegh  This Book  This Book was intitled  A Defence of the Queen's Proceedings against  Mary  Queen of  Scotland Written by one  Robert Snag  See the Arraignment of Sir  Walter Ralegh  By Sir  Thomas Overbury to  was written by a Man of your Profession Mr  Attorney  Attorney  I would not have you impatient  Ralegh  Methinks you fall out with yourself I say nothing  Attorney  By this Book you would persuade Men that he is not the lawful King Now let us consider some Circumstances My Lords you know my Lord  Cobham  for whom we all lament and rejoice lament in that his House which hath stood so long unspotted is now ruinated Rejoice in that his Treasons are revealed is neither Politician nor Swordman  Ralegh  was both united in the Cause with him and therefore Cause of his Destruction Another Circumstance is the secret contriving of it  Humphry Stafford  claimed Sanctuary for Treason  Ralegh  in his  Machiavilian  Policy hath made a Sanctuary for Treason He must talk with none but  Cobham  because saith he one Witness can never condemn me For  Brook  said unto Sir  Griffith Markham  take heed how you do make my Lord  Cobham  acquainted for whatsoever he knoweth  Ralegh  the Witch will get it out of him As soon as  Ralegh  was examined on one Point of Treason concerning my Lord  Cobham  he wrote to him thus  I have been examined of you and confessed nothing  Further you sent to him  by your trusty  Francis Kemish  that one Witness could not condemn and therefore bad his Lordship be of good Courage Came this out of  Cobham  's Quiver No But out of  Ralegh  's  Machiavelian  and Devilish Policy Yea but  Cobham  did retract it Why then did you urge it Now then see the most horrible Practices that ever came out of the bottomless Pit of the lowest Hell After that  Ralegh  had Intelligence that  Cobham  had accused him he endeavoured to have Intelligence from  Cobham  which he had gotten by young Sir  John Payton  But I think it was the Error of his Youth  Ralegh  The Lords told it me or else I had not been sent to the Tower  Attorney  Thus  Cobham  by the Instigation of  Ralegh  entred into these Actions So that the Question will be Whether you are not the principal Traytor and he would nevertheless have entred into it Why did  Cobham  retract all that same  First  Because  Ralegh  was so odious he thought he should fare the worse for his Sake  dly  He thought thus with himself if he be free I shall clear myself the better After this  Cobham  asked for a Preacher to confer with pretending to have Dr  Andrews  but indeed he meant not to have him but Mr  Galloway  a worthy and reverend Preacher who can do more with the King as he said than any other that he seeing his constant Denial might inform the King thereof Here he plays with the Preacher If  Ralegh  could persuade the Lords that  Cobham  had no Intent to travel then he thought all should be well Here is Forgery In the Tower  Cobham  must write to Sir  Thomas Vane  a worthy Man That he meant not to go into  Spain  which Letter  Ralegh  devised in  Cobham  's Name  Ralegh  I will wash my Hands of the Indictment and die a true Man to the King  Attorney  You are the absolutest Traytor that ever was  Ralegh  Your Phrases will not prove it Mr  Attorney  Attorney  Cobham  writeth a Letter to my Lord  Cecil  and doth will  Mellis  his Man to lay it in a  Spanish  Bible and to make as though he found it by chance This was after he had Intelligence with this Viper then he was false  Lord Cecil  You mean a Letter intended to me I never had it  Attorney  No my Lord you had it not You my Masters of the Jury respect not the Wickedness and Hatred of the Man respect his Cause if he be guilty I know you will have Care of it for the Preservation of the King the Continuance of the Gospel authorised and the Good of us all  Ralegh  I do not hear yet that you have spoken one Word against me here is no Treason of mine done If my Lord  Cobham  be a Traytor what is that to me  Attorney  All that he did was by thy Instigation thou Viper for I  Thou  thee thou Traitor  Ralegh  It becometh not a Man of Quality and Virtue to call me so But I take Comfort in it it is all you can do  Attorney  Have I anger'd you  Ralegh  I am in no Case to be angry  C J Popham  Sir  Walter Ralegh  Mr  Attorney  speaketh out of the Zeal of his Duty for the Service of the King and you for your Life be valiant on both Sides  Now they proceed to the reading the Proofs  The Lord  Cobham  's Examination read  He confesseth he had a Pasport to go into  Spain  intending to go to the Archduke to confer with him  about these Practices and because he knew the Archduke had not Money to pay his own Army from thence he meant to go to  Spain  to deal with the King for the    Crowns and to return by  Jersey  and that nothing should be done until he had spoken with Sir  Walter Ralegh  for Distribution of the Money to them which were discontented in  England  At the first Beginning he breathed out Oaths and Exclamations against  Ralegh  calling him Villain and Traytor saying he had never entered into those Courses but by his Instigation and that he would never let him alone  Here Mr  Attorney  willed the Clerk of the CrownOffice to read over these last Words again  he would never let him alone  The Lord  Cobham  's Examination  Besides he spake of Plots and Invasions Of the Particulars whereof he could give no Account tho'  Ralegh  and he had conferred of them because he was as he said confounded with them Further he said he was afraid of  Ralegh  that when he should return by  Jersey  that he would have him and the Money to the King Being examined of Sir  Arthur Gorge  he freed him saying They never durst trust him but Sir  Arthur Savage  they intended to use because they thought him a fit Man  Ralegh  Let me see the Examination This is absolutely all the Evidence can be brought against me poor Shifts You Gentlemen of the Jury I pray you understand this This is that which must either condemn or give me Life which must free me or send my Wife and Children to beg their Bread about the Streets This is what must prove me a notorious Traytor or true Subject to the King Let me see my Accusation that I may make my Answer  Clerk of the Council  I did read it and shew you all the Examinations  Ralegh  At my first Examination at  Windsor  my Lords asked me what I knew of  Cobham  's Practice with  Aremberg  I answered negatively And as concerning  Arabella  I protest before God I never heard one Word of it If that be proved let me be guilty of a thousand Treasons It is a strange Thing you will impute that to me when I never heard so much as the Name of  Arabella Stuart  but only the Name of  Arabella  After being examined I told my Lords that I thought my Lord  Cobham  had Conference with  Aremberg  l suspected his visiting of him For after he departed from me at  Durham  House I saw him pass by his own Stairs and passed over to St  MarySaviours  where I knew  Lawrency  a Merchant and a Follower of  Aremberg  and therefore likely to go unto him My Lord  Cecil  asked my Opinion concerning  Lawrency  I said That if you do not apprehend  Lawrency  it is dangerous he will fly if you do apprehend him you shall give my Lord  Cobham  Notice thereof I was asked likewise Who was the greatest Man with my Lord  Cobham  I answered I knew no Man so great with him as young  Wyat  of  Kent  As soon as  Cobham  saw my Letter to have discovered his Dealing with  Aremberg  in his Fury he accused me but before he came to the Stairfoot he repented him and said he had done me wrong When he came to the End of his Accusation he added That if he had brought this Money to  Jersey  that I would have delivered him and the Money to the King Mr  Attorney  You said this never came out of  Cobham  's Quiver he is a simple Man Is he so simple No He hath Dispositions of his own he will not easily be guided by others but when he has once taken Head in a Matter he is not easily drawn from it he is no Babe But it is strange for me to devise with  Cobham  that he  should go to  Spain  to persuade the King to disburse so much Money he being a Man of no Love in  England  and I having resigned my Room of chiefest Command the Wardenship of the  Stannaries  Is it not strange for me to make myself  Robin Hood  or a  Kitt  or a  Cade  I knowing  England  to be in better Estate to defend itself than ever it was I knew  Scotland  united  Ireland  quieted  Denmark  assured which before was suspected I knew that having lost a Lady whom Time had surprised we had now an active King a lawful Successor The State of  Spain  was not unknown to me I had written a Discourse which I had intended to present unto the King against Peace with  Spain  I knew the  Spaniards  had six Repulses three in  Ireland  and three at Sea and once in at  Cales  by my Lord Admiral I knew he was discouraged and dishonoured I knew the King of  Spain  to be the proudest Prince living but now he cometh creeping to the King my Master for Peace I knew whereas before he had in his Ports six or seven Score Sail of Ships he hath now but six or seven I knew of twentyfive Millions he had from his  Indies  he hath scarce one left I knew him so poor that the Jesuits in  Spain  who were wont to have such large Allowance were fain to beg at the Churchdoor Was it ever read or heard that any Prince should disburse so much Money without a sufficient Pawn I knew her own Subjects the Citizens of  London  would not lend her Majesty Money without Lands in Mortgage I knew the Queen did not lend the  States  Money without  Flushing Brill  and other Towns for a Pawn And can it be thought he would let  Cobham  have so great a Sum  I never came to the Lord  Cobham  's but about Matters of his Profit as the ordering of his House paying of his Servants Boardwages c I had  of his when I was examined four thousand Pounds worth of Jewels for a Purchase a Pearl of three thousand Pounds and a Ring worth five hundred Pounds If he had had a Fancy to run away he would not have left so much to have purchased a Lease in Feefarm I saw him buy three hundred Pounds worth of Books to send to his Library at  Canterbury  and a Cabinet of thirty Pounds to give to Mr  Attorney  for drawing the Conveyances and God in Heaven knoweth not I whither he intended to travel But for that Practice with  Arabella  or Letters to  Aremberg  or any Discourse with him or in what Language he spake unto him if I knew any of these Things I would absolutely confess the Indictment and acknowledge myself worthy a thousand Deaths  Cobham  's second Examination read  The Lord  Cobham  being required to subscribe to an Examination there was shewed a Note under  Ralegh  's Hand the which when he had perused he paused and after brake forth into these Speeches Oh Villain Oh Traytor I will now tell you all the Truth And then said His Purpose was to go into  Flanders  and into  Spain  for the obtaining the aforesaid Money and that  Ralegh  had appointed to meet him in  Jersey  as he returned home to be advised of him about the Distribution of the Money  Popham Lord Chief Justice  When  Cobham  answered to the Interrogatories he made scruple to subscribe and being urged to it he said if he might hear me affirm that a Person of his Degree ought to set his Hand he would I lying then at  Richmond  for Fear of the Plague was sent for and I told him he ought to subscribe otherwise it were a Contempt of a high Nature  Then he subscribed  The Lords questioned with him further and he shewed them a Letter as I thought written to me but it was indeed written to my Lord  Cecil  He desired to see the  Letter again and then said Oh Wretch Oh Traytor Whereby I perceived you had not performed that Trust he had reposed in you  Ralegh  He is as passionate a Man as lives for he hath not spared the best Friends he hath in  England  in his Passion My Lords I take it he that hath been examined hath ever been asked at the Time of his Examination if it be according to his Meaning and then to subscribe Methinks my Lords when he accuses a Man he should give some Account and Reason of it it is not sufficient to say we talked of it If I had been the Plotter would not I have given  Cobham  some Arguments whereby to persuade the King of  Spain  and answer his Objections I knew  Westmorland  and  Bothwell  Men of other Understandings than  Cobham  were ready to beg their Bread  Sir  Thomas Fowler one of the Jury  Did Sir  Walter Ralegh  write a Letter to my Lord before he was examined concerning him or not  Attorney  Yes  Lord Cecil  I am in great Dispute with my self to speak in the Case of this Gentleman A former Dearness between me and him ty'd so firm a Knot of my Conceit of his Virtues now broken by a Discovery of his Imperfections I protest did I serve a King that I knew would be displeased with me for speaking in this Case I would speak whatever came of it But seeing he is compacted of Piety and Justice and one that will not mislike any Man for speaking a Truth I will answer your Question  Sir  Walter Ralegh  was staid by me at  Windsor  upon the first News of  Copley  that the King's Person should be surpriz'd by my Lord  Grey  and Mr  George Brook  when I found  Brook  was in I suspected  Cobham  then I doubted  Ralegh  to be a Partaker I speak not this that it should be thought  I had greater Judgment than the Rest of my Lords in making this Haste to have him examin'd  Ralegh  following to  Windsor  I met with him upon the Terrace and willed him as from the King to stay saying The Lords had something to say to him Then he was examined but not concerning my Lord  Cobham  but of the surprizing Treason my Lord  Grey  was apprehended and likewise  Brook  by  Brook  we found that he had given Notice to  Cobham  of the surprizing Treason as he deliver'd it to us but with as much Sparingness of a Brother as he might We sent for my Lord  Cobham  to  Richmond  where he stood upon his Justification and his Quality sometimes being froward he said he was not bound to subscribe wherewith we made the King acquainted  Cobham  said if my Lord Chief Justice would say it were a Contempt he would subscribe whereof being resolved he subscribed There was a Light given to  Aremberg  that  Lawrency  was examined but that  Ralegh  knew that  Cobham  was examined is more than I know  Ralegh  If my Lord  Cobham  had trusted me in the Main was not I as fit a Man to be trusted in the Bye  Lord Cecil  Ralegh  did by Letter acquaint us that my Lord  Cobham  had sent  Lawrency  to  Aremberg  when he knew not he had any Dealings with him  Lord H Howard  It made for you if  Lawrency  had been only acquainted with  Cobham  and not with you But you knew his whole Estate and were acquainted with  Cobham  's Practice with  Lawrency  and it was known to you before that  Lawrency  depended on  Aremberg  Attorney    Ralegh  protesteth against the surprizing Treason That he knew not of the Matter touching  Arabella  I would not charge you Sir  Walter  with a Matter of Falshood You  say you suspected the Intelligence that  Cobham  had with  Aremberg  by  Lawrency  Ralegh  I thought it had been no other Intelligence but such as might be warranted  Attorney  Then it was but lawful Suspicion But to that whereas you said That  Cobham  had accused you on Passion I answer three Ways I observ'd when  Cobham  said Let me see the Letter again he paused and when he did see that Count  Aremberg  was touch'd he cry'd out  O Traytor O Villain now will I confess the whole Truth  The Accusation of a Man on Hear say is nothing Would he accuse himself on Passion and ruinate his Cause and Posterity out of Malice to accuse you Could this be out of Passion Mark the Manner of it  Cobham  had told this at least two Months before to his Brother  Brook You are Fools you are on the Bye  Ralegh  and I are on the Main we mean to take away the King and his Cubs  this he deliver'd two Months before So mark the Manner and the Matter he would not turn the Weapon against his own Brother and accuse himself to accuse you  Ralegh  Hath  Cobham  confessed that  Lord Chief Justice  This is spoken by Mr  Attorney  to prove that  Cobham  's Speech came not out of Passion  Ralegh  Let it be proved that  Cobham  said so  Attorney  Cobham  saith he was a long Time doubtful of  Ralegh  that he would send him and the Money to the King Did  Cobham  fear lest you would betray him in  Jersey  Then of Necessity there must be Trust between you No Man can betray a Man but he that is trusted in my Understanding This is the greatest Argument to prove that he was acquainted with  Cobham  's Proceedings  Ralegh  hath a deeper Reach than to make himself as he said  Robin Hood  a  Ket  or  Cade  yet I never heard  that  Robin Hood  was a Traytor they say he was an Outlaw And whereas he saith that our King is not only more wealthy and potent than his Prededecessors but also more politick and wise so that he could have no Hope to prevail I answer there is no King so potent wise and active but he may be overtaken through Treason Whereas you say  Spain  is so poor discoursing so largely thereof it had been better for you to have kept in  Guiana  than to have been so well acquainted with the State of  Spain  Besides if you could have brought  Spain  and  Scotland  to have joined you might have had Hope to prevail For his six Overthrows I answer he hath the more Malice because Repulses breed Desire of Revenge Then you say you never talk'd with  Cobham  but about Leases and letting Lands and ordering his House I never knew you Clerk of the Kitchen c If you had fallen on your Knees at first and confessed the Treason it had been better for you You say he meant to have given me a Cabinet of thirty Pounds perhaps he thought by those Means to have anticipated me therewith But you say all these are Circumstances I answer all this Accusation in Circumstance is true Here now I might appeal to my Lords that you take hold of this that he subscribed not to the Accusation  Lord H Howard  Cobham  was not then pressed to subscribe  Attorney  His Accusation being testified by the Lords is of as great Force as if he had subscribed  Ralegh  saith again if the Accuser be alive he must be brought Face to Face to speak and alledges  Edw  III That there must be two sufficient Witnesses that must be brought Face to Face before the accused and alledgeth and  Eliz  Ralegh  You try me by the  Spanish  Inquisition if you proceed only by the Circumstances without two Witnesses  Attorney  This is a treasonable Speech  Ralegh  Evertere hominem justum in causa sua injustum est  Good my Lords let it be proved either by the Laws of the Land or by the Laws of God that there ought not to be two Witnesses appointed yet I will not stand to defend this Point in Law if the King will have it so it is no rare Thing to be falsly accused A Judge condemned a Woman in  Sarum  for killing her Husband on the Testimony of one Witness afterwards his Man confessed the Murder when she was executed Who after being touch'd in Conscience for the Judgment was used to say  Quod nunquam de hoc facto animam in vita sua purgaret  It is also commanded by the Scripture  Deut  xvii  In ore duorum aut trium testium  c and xix  Non stabit unus testis contra aliquem  c  If Christ requireth it as it appeareth  Mat  xviii If by the Statute Civil Law and God's Word it be required that there must be two Witnesses at the least bear with me if I desire one  I would not desire to live if I were privy to  Cobham  's Proceedings I had been a Slave a Villain a Fool if I had endeavoured to set up  Arabella  and refused so gracious a Lord and Soveraign But urge your Proofs  Lord Chief Justice  You have offered Questions on divers Statutes all which mention two Accusers in Case of Indictments you have deceived yourself for the Laws of  Ed  III and  Ed  VI are repeal'd It sufficeth now if there be Proofs made either under Hand or by Testimony of Witnesses or by Oaths it needs not the Subscription of the Party so there be Hands of credible Men to testify the Examination  Ralegh  It may be an Error in me and if those Laws be repeal'd yet I hope the Equity of those Laws remains still but if you affirm it it must be a Law to Posterity the Proof of the common Law is by Witness and Jury let  Cobham  be here let him speak it Call my Accuser before my Face and I have done  Attorney  Scientia seeleris est mera Ignorantia  You have read the Letter of the Law but understand it not Here was your Anchorhold and your Rendezvous you trust to  Cobham  either  Cobham  must accuse you or not accuse you if he did then it would not hurt you because he is but one Witness if he did not then you are safe  Ralegh  If ever I read a Word of the Law or Statute before I was Prisoner in the  Tower  God confound me  Attorney  Now I come to prove the Circumstances of the Accusation to be true  Cobham  confessed he had a Pasport to travel hereby intending to present Overtures to the Archduke and from thence to go to  Spain  and there to have Conference with the King for Money You say he promised to come home by  Jersey  to make merry with you and your Wife  Ralegh  I said in his Return from  France  not  Spain  Attorney  Further in his Examination he saith Nothing could be set down for the Distribution of the Money to the Discontented without Conference with  Ralegh  You said it should have been for Procurement of Peace but it was for raising Rebellion Further  Cobham  saith He would never have entred into these Courses but by your Instigation and that you would never let him alone Your Scholar was not apt enough to tell us all the Plots that is enough for you to do that are his Master You intended to trust Sir  Arthur Savage  whom I  take to be an honest and true Gentleman but not Sir  Arthur Gorge  Ralegh  All this is but one Accusation of  Cobham  's I hear no other Thing to which Accusation he never subscribed nor avouched it I beseech you my Lords let  Cobham  be sent for charge him on his Soul on his Allegiance to the King if he affirm it I am guilty  Lord Cecil  It is the Accusation of my Lord  Cobham  it is the Evidence against you must it not be of Force without his Subscription I desire to be resolved by the Judges Whether by the Law it is not a forcible Argument of Evidence  The Judges  My Lord it is  Ralegh  The King at his Coronation is sworn  In omnibus Judiciis suis Aequitatem non Rigorem Legis observare  By the Rigour and Cruelty of the Law it may be a forcible Evidence  Lord Chief Justice  That is not the Rigour of the Law but the Justice of the Law else when a Man hath made a plain Accusation by Practice he might be brought to retract it again  Ralegh  Oh my Lord you may use Equity  Lord Chief Justice  That is from the King you are to have Justice from us  Anderson  The Law is if the Matter be proved to the Jury they must find you guilty for  Cobham  's Accusation is not only against you there are other Things sufficient  Lord Cecil  Now that Sir  Walter Ralegh  is satisfied that  Cobham  's Subscription is not necessary I pray you Mr  Attorney  go on  Ralegh  Good Mr  Attorney  be patient and give me Leave  Lord Cecil  An unnecessary Patience is a Hindrance let him go on with his Proofs and then refel them  Ralegh  I would answer particularly  Lord Cecil  If you would have a Table and Pen and Ink you shall  Then Paper and Ink was given him  Here the Clerk of the Crown read the Letter which the Lord  Cobham  did write in  July  which was to the Effect of his former Examination further saying  I have disclosed all to accuse any falsely were to burthen my own Conscience  Attorney  Read  Copley  's Confession the th of  June  he saith  He was offered    Crowns to be in this Action  Here  Watson  's Additions were read  The great Mass of Money from the Count was impossible c  Brook  's Confession read  There have Letters passed  saith he  between  Cobham  and  Aremberg  for a great Sum of Money to assist a second Action for the surprizing of his Majesty  Attorney  It is not possible it was of Passion for it was in Talk before three Men being severally examined who agreed in the Sum to be bestowed on disaffected Persons That  Grey  should have Crowns and  Ralegh  should have or Crowns  Cobham  's Examination  July    If the Money might be procured  saith he  then a Man may give Pensions  Being asked if a Pension should not be given to his Brother  Brook  he denied it not  Lawrency  's Examination  Within five Days after  Aremberg  arrived  Cobham  resorted unto him That Night that  Cobham  went to  Aremberg  with  Lawrency Ralegh  supped with him  Attorney  Ralegh  must have his Part of the Money therefore now he is a Traytor The Crown shall never stand one Year on the Head of the King my Master if a Traytor may not be  condemned by Circumstances For if  A  tells  B  and  B  tells  C  and  C D  c you shall never prove Treason by two Witnesses  Ralegh  's Examination was read  He confesseth  Cobham  offered him    Crowns which he was to have for the Furtherance of the Peace between  England  and  Spain  and that he should have it within three Days To which he said he gave this Answer When I see the Money I will tell you more for I had thought it had been one of his ordinary idle Conceits and therefore made no Account thereof  Ralegh  The  Attorney  hath made a long Narration of  Copley  and the Priests which concerns me nothing neither know I how  Cobham  was altered For he told me If I would agree to further the Peace he would get me Crowns I asked him Who shall have the rest of the Money He said I will offer such a Nobleman who was not named some of the Money I said He will not be persuaded by you and will extremely hate you for such a Motion Let me be pinched to Death with hot Irons if ever I knew there was any Intention to bestow the Money on discontented Persons I had made a Discourse against the Peace and would have printed it if  Cobham  changed his Mind if the Priests if  Brook  had any such Intent what is that to me They must answer for it He offered me the Money before  Aremberg  came that is Difference of Time  Serj Philips  Ralegh  confesseth the Matter but avoideth it by distinguishing of Times You said it was offered you before the Coming of  Aremberg  which is false For you being examined whether you should have such Money of  Cobham  or not You said Yea and that you should have it within two or three Days  Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri  Lord Henry Howard  Alledge me any Ground or Cause wherefore you gave Ear to my Lord  Cobham  for receiving Pensions in Matters you had not to deal with  Ralegh  Could I stop my Lord  Cobham  's Mouth  Lord Cecil  Sir  Walter Ralegh  presseth that my Lord  Cobham  should be brought Face to Face If he asks Things of Favour and Grace they must come only from him that can give them If we sit here as Commissioners how shall we be satisfied whether he ought to be brought unless we hear the Judges speak  Lord Chief Justice  This Thing cannot be granted for then a Number of Treasons should flourish The Accuser may be drawn by Practice whilst he is in Person  Judge Gaudy  The Statute you speak of concerning two Witnesses in Case of Treason is found to be inconvenient therefore by another Law it was taken away  Ralegh  The common Trial of  England  is by Jury and Witnesses  Lord Chief Justice  No by Examination If three conspire a Treason and they all confess it here is never a Witness yet they are condemned  Judge Warburton  I marvel Sir  Walter  that you being of such Experience and Wit should stand on this Point for so many Horsestealers may escape if they may not be condemned without Witnesses If one should rush into the King's PrivyChamber whilst he is alone and kill the King which God forbid and this Man be met coming with his Sword drawn all bloody shall not he be condemned to Death My Lord  Cobham  hath perhaps been laboured withal and to save you his old Friend it may be that he will deny all that which he hath said  Ralegh  I know not how you conceive the Law  Lord Chief Justice  Nay we do not conceive the Law but we know the Law  Ralegh  The Wisdom of the Law of God is absolute and perfect  Haec fac vives  c But now by the Wisdom of the State the Wisdom of the Law is uncertain Indeed where the Accuser is not to be had conveniently I agree with you but here my Accuser may he is alive and in the House  Susanna  had been condemned if  Daniel  had not cried out  Will you condemn an innocent Israelite without Examination or Knowledge of the Truth  Remember it is absolutely the Commandment of God if a false Witness rise up you shall cause him to be brought before the Judges if he be found false he shall have the Punishment which the Accused should have had It is very sure for my Lord to accuse me is my certain Danger and may be a means to excuse himself  Lord Chief Juctice  There must not such a Gap be opened for the Destruction of the King as would be if we should grant this You plead hard for yourself but the Laws plead as hard for the King I did never hear that Course to be taken in a Case of Treason as to write to one another or speak to one another during the Time of their Imprisonment There hath been Intelligence between you and what underhand Practices there may be I know not If the Circumstances agree not with the Evidence we will not condemn you  Ralegh  The King desires nothing but the Knowledge of the Truth and would have no Advantage taken by Severity of the Law If ever we had a gracious King now we have I hope as he is such are his Ministers If there be but a Trial of five Marks at the Common Law a Witness must be deposed Good my Lords let my Accuser come Face to Face and be deposed  Lord Chief Justice  You have no Law for it God forbid any Man should accuse himself upon his Oath  Attorney  The Law presumes a Man will not accuse himself to accuse another You are an odious Man For  Cobham  thinks his Cause the worse that you are in it Now you shall hear of some Stirs to be raised in  Scotland  Part of  Copley's  Examination  Also  Watson  told me that a special Person told him that  Aremberg  offered to him a thousand Crowns to be in that Action and that  Brook  said the Stirs in  Scotland  came out of  Ralegh  's Head  Ralegh  Brook  hath been taught his Lesson  Lord H Howard  This Examination was taken before me Did I teach him his Lesson  Ralegh  I protest before God I meant it not by any PrivyCounsellor but because Money is scant he will juggle on both Sides  Ralegh  's Examination  The Way to invade  England  were to begin with Stirs in  Scotland  Ralegh  I think so still I have spoken it to divers of the Lords of the Council by Way of Discourse and Opinion  Attorney  Now let us come to those Words of  Destroying the King and his Cubs  Ralegh  O barbarous if they like unnatural Villains should use those Words shall I be charged with them I will not hear it I was never falfe to the Crown of  England  I have spent Crowns of mine own against the  Spanish  Faction for the Good of my Country Do you bring the Words of these hellish Spiders  Clark Watson  and others against me  Attorney  Thou hast a  Spanish  Heart and thyself art a Spider of Hell for thou confessest the  King to be a most sweet and gracious Prince and yet hast conspired against him  Watson  's Examination read  He said that  George Brook  told him twice that his Brother the Lord  Cobham  said to him That you are but on the Bye but  Ralegh  and I are on the Main  Brook  's Examination read  Being ask'd what was meant by this Jargon the Bye and the Main he said That the Lord  Cobham  told him that  Grey  and others were in the Bye he and  Ralegh  were on the Main Being ask'd what Exposition his Brother made of these Words he said he is loth to repeat And after saith by the Main was meant the taking away of the King and his Issue And thinks on his Conscience it was infused into his Brother's Head by  Ralegh  Cobham  's Examination read  Being ask'd if ever he had said  It will never be well in  England  till the King and his Cubs were taken away  He said  He hod answered before and that he would answer no more to that Point  Ralegh  I am not named in all this There is a Law of two Sorts of Accusers one of his own Knowledge another by Hearsay  Earl of Suffolk  See the Case of  Arnold  Lord Chief Justice  It is the Case of Sir  William Thomas  and Sir  Nicholas Arnold  Ralegh  If this may be you will have any Man's Life in a Week  Attorney  Ralegh  saith That  Cobham  was in a Passion when he said so Would he tell his Brother any Thing of Malice against  Ralegh  whom he loved as his Life  Ralegh  Brook  never loved me until his Brother had accused me he said nothing  Lord Cecil  We have heard nothing that might lead us to think that  Brook  accused you  he was  only in the Surprising Treason  for by accusing you he should accuse his Brother  Ralegh  He doth not care much for that  Lord Cecil  I must judge the best The Accusation of his Brother was not voluntary he pared every Thing as much as he could to save his Brother  Cobham  's Examination read  He saith he had a Book written against the Title of the King which he had of  Ralegh  and that he gave it to his Brother  Ralegh  said it was foolishly written  Attorney  After the King came within twelve Miles of  London Cobham  never came to see him and intended to travel without seeing the Queen ahd the Prince Now in this Discontentment you gave him the Book and he gave it to his Brother  Ralegh  I never gave it him he took it off my Table For I well remember a little before that Time I received a Challenge from Sir  Amias Preston  and for that I did intend to answer it I resolved to leave my Estate settled therefore laid out all my loose Papers amongst which was this Book  Lord Howard  Where had you this Book  Ralegh  In the old LordTreasurer's Study after his Death  Lord Cecil  Did you ever shew or make known the Book to me  Ralegh  No my Lord  Lord Cecil  Was it one of the Books which was left to me or my Brother  Ralegh  I took it out of the Study in my Lord Treasurer's House in the  Strand  Lord Cecil  After my Father's Decease Sir  Walter Ralegh  desired to search for some Cosmographical De  criptions of the  Indies  which he thought were in his Study and were not to be had in Print which I granted and would have trusted Sir  Walter  Ralegh  as soon as any Man though since for some Infirmities the Bands of my Affection to him have been broken and yet reserving my Duty to the King my Master which I can by no Means dispense with by God I love him and have a great Conflict within myself But I must needs say Sir  Walter  used me a little unkindly to take the Book away without my Knowledge nevertheless I need make no Apology in Behalf of my Father considering how useful and necessary it is for PrivyCounsellors and those in his Place to intercept and keep such kind of Writings for whosoever should then search his Study may in all Likelihood find all the notorious Libels that were writ against the late Queen and whosoever should rumage my Study or at least my Cabinet may find several against the King our Sovereign Lord since his Accession to the Throne  Ralegh  This Book was in Manuscript and the late Lord Treasurer had wrote in the Beginning of it with his own Hands these Words  This is the Book of Robert Snagg  And I do own as my Lord  Cecil  has said that I believe they may also find in my House almost all the Libels that have been writ against the late Queen  Attorney  You were no PrivyCounsellor and I hope never shall be  Lord Cecil  He was not a sworn Counsellor of State but he has been called to Consultations  Ralegh  I think it a very severe Interpretation of the Law to bring me within Compass of Treason for this Book writ so long ago of which nobody had read any more than the Heads of the Chapters and which was burnt by  Brook  without my Privity admitting I had delivered the same to my Lord  Cobham  without allowing or approving but discommending it according to  Cobham's  first Accusation And put the Case I should come  to my Lord  Cecil  as I have often done and find a Stranger with him with a Packet of Libels and my Lord should let me have one or two of them to peruse This I hope is no Treason  Attorney  I observe there was Intelligence between you and  Cobham  in the Tower for after he said  It was against the King's Title  he denied it again  Sir  William Wade  First my Lord  Cobham  confesseth it and after he had subscribed it he revoked it again To me he always said  That the Drift of it was against the King's Title  Ralegh  I protest before God and all his Works I gave him not the Book  Note  Sir  Robert Wroth  speaketh or whispereth something secretly  Attorney  My Lords I must complain of Sir  Robert Wroth  he says this Evidence is not material  Sir  Robert Wroth  I never spake the Words  Attorney  Let Mr  Serjeant Philips  testify whether he heard them  Lord Cecil  I will give my Word for Sir  Robert Wroth  Sir  Robert Wroth  I will speak as truly as you Mr  Attorney  for by God I never spake it  Lord Chief Justice  Wherefore should this Book be burnt  Ralegh  I burned it not  Serj Philips  You presented your Friend with it when he was discontented If it had been before the Queen's Death it had been a less Matter but you gave it him presently when he came from the King which was the Time of his Discontentment  Ralegh  Here is a Book supposed to be Treasonable I never read it commended it or deliver'd it nor urged it  Attorney  This is cunning  Ralegh  Every Thing that doth make for me is cunning and every Thing that maketh against me is probable  Attorney  Lord  Cobham  saith that  Kemish  came to him with a Letter torn and did with him not to be dismay'd for one Witness could not hurt him  Ralegh  This poor Man hath been close Prisoner the  e eighteen Weeks he was offered the Rack to make him confess I never sent any such Message by him I only writ to him to tell him what I had done with Mr  Attorney  having of his at that Time a great Pearl and a Diamond  Lord H Howard  No Circumstance moveth me more than this  Kemish  was never on the Rack the King gave Charge that no Rigour should be used  Commissioners  We protest before God there was no such Matter intended to our Knowledges  Ralegh  Was not the Keeper of the Rack sent for and he threatned with it  Sir  William Wade  When Mr  Sollicitor  and my self examined  Kemish  we told him he deserved the Rack but did not threaten him wiih it  Commissioners  It was more than we knew  Cobham  's Examination read  He said  Kemish  brought him a Letter from  Ralegh  and that Part which was concerning the Lords of the Council was rent out that he was examined and cleared him of all and that the Lord  H Howard  said because he was discontent he was fit to be in the Action And further that  Kemish  said to him from  Ralegh  that he should be of good Comfort for one Witness could not condemn a Man for Treason  Lord Cecil  Cobham  was asked whether and when he heard from you he said every Day  Ralegh  Kemish  added more I never bad him speak these Words  Nota  Mr  Attorney  here ofsered to interrupt him  Lord Cecil  It is his last Discourse Give him leave Mr  Attorney  Ralegh  I am accused concerning  Arabella  concerning Money out of  Spain  My Lord Chief Justice saith a Man may be condemned with one Witness yea without any Witnefs  Cobham  is guilty of many Things  Conscientia mille Testes  He hath accused himself what can he hope for but Mercy My Lords vouchsafe me this Grace Let him be brought being alive and in the House let him avouch any of these Things I will confess the whole Indictment and renounce the King's Mercy  Lord Cecil  Here hath been a Touch of the Lady  Arabella Stuart  a near Kinswoman of the King's Let us not scandal the Innocent by Confusion of Speech She is as innocent of all these Things as I or any Man here only she received a Letter from  Cobham  to prepare her which she laugh'd at and immediately sent it to the King So far was she from Discontentment that she laugh'd him to scorn But you see how far the Count of  Aremberg  did consent  The Lord Admiral  Nottingham  being by in a Standing with the Lady  Arabella  spake to the Court  The Lady doth here protest upon her Salvation that she never dealt in any of these Things and so she willed me to tell the Court  Lord Cecil  The Lord  Cobham  wrote to my Lady  Arabella  to know if he might come to speak with her and gave her to understand that there were some about the King that laboured to disgrace her she doubted it was but a Trick But  Brook  saith his Brother moved him to procure  Arabella  to write Letters to the Kings of  Spain  But he saith he never did  Ralegh  The Lord  Cobham  hath accused me you see in what Manner he hath forsworn it Were it not for his Accusation all this were nothing Let him be asked if I knew of the Letter which  Lawrency  brought to him from  Aremberg  Let me speak for my Life it can be no hurt for him to be brought he dares not accuse me If you grant me not this Favour I am strangely used  Campian  was not denied to have his Accusers Face to Face  Lord Chief Justice  Since he must needs have Justice the acquitting of his old Friend may move him to speak otherwise than the Truth  Ralegh  If I had been the Infuser of all these Treasons into him You Gentlemen of the Jury mark this He said I have been the Cause of all his Miseries and the Destruction of his House and that all Evil hath happened unto him by my wicked Counsel if this be true whom hath he Cause to accuse and be revenged on but on me And I know him to be as revengeful as any Man on Earth  Attorney  He is a Party and may not come the Law is against it  Ralegh  It is a Toy to tell me of Law I defy such Law I stand on the Fact  Lord Cecil  I am afraid my often speaking who am inferior to the Lords here present will make the World think I delight to hear myself talk My Affection to you Sir  Walter Ralegh  was not extinguished but slaked in Regard of your Deserts You know the Law of the Realm to the which your Mind doth not contest that my Lord  Cobham  cannot be brought  Ralegh  He may be my Lord  Lord Cecil  But dare you challenge it  Ralegh  No  Lord Cecil  You say that my Lord  Cobham  your main Accuser must come to accuse you You say he hath retracted I say many Particulars are not retracted What the Validity of all this is is merely left to the Jury Let me ask you this If my Lord  Cobham  will say you were the only Instigator of him to proceed in the Treasons dare you put yourself on this  Ralegh  If he will speak it before God and the King that ever I knew of  Arabella  's Matter or the Money out of  Spain  or of the surprizing Treason I put myself on it God's Will and the King's be done with me  Lord Howard  How if he speak Things equivalent to what you have said  Ralegh  Yes in a main Point  Lord Cecil  If he say you have been the Instigator of him to deal with the  Spanish  King had not the Council Cause to draw you hither  Ralegh  I put myself on it  Lord Cecil  Then Sir  Walter Ralegh  call upon God and prepare yourself for I do verily believe my Lords will prove this Excepting your Faults I call them no worse by God I am your Friend The Heat and Passion in you and the Attorney's Zeal in the King's Service makes me speak this  Ralegh  Whosoever is the Workman it is Reason he should give Account of his Work to the Workmaster  But let it be proved that he acquainted me with any of his Conferences with  Aremberg  He would surely have given me some Account  Lord Cecil  That follows not If I set you on Work and you give me no Account am I therefore innocent  Attorney  For the Lady  Arabella  I said she was never acquainted with the Matter Now that  Ralegh  had Conference in all these Treasons it is manifest  the Jury hath heard the Matter There is one  Dyer  a Pilot that being in  Lisbon  met with a  Portugal  Gentleman who asked him if the King of  England  was crowned yet To whom he anfwered  I think not yet but he shall be shortly  Nay saith the  Portugal  Gentlemen that shall he never be for his Throat will be cut by  Don Ralegh  and  Don Cobham  before he be crown'd  Dyer  was called and sworn and delivered this Evidence  Dyer  I came to a Merchant's House in  Lisbon  to see a Boy that I had there there came in a Gentleman into the House and enquiring what Countryman I was I said an  Englishman  Whereupon he asked me if the King was crowned And I answered that I hoped he should be so shortly Nay faith he he shall never be crowned for  Don Ralegh  and  Don Cobham  will cut his Throat e'er that Day come  Ralegh  What infer you upon this  Attorney  That your Treason hath Wings  Ralegh  If  Cobham  did practise with  Aremberg  how could it not but be known in  Spain  Why did they name the Duke of  Buckingham  with  Jack Straw  's Treason and the Duke of  York  with  Jack Cade  but that it was to countenance his Treason  Consider you Gentlemen of the Jury there is no Cause so doubtful which the King's Council cannot make good against the Law Consider my Disability and their Ability They prove nothing against me only they bring the Accusation of my Lord  Cobham  which he hath lamented and repented as heartily as if it had been for a horrible Murther For he knew that all this Sorrow which should come to me is by his Means Presumptions must proceed from precedent or subsequent Facts I have spent Crowns against the  Spaniard  I had not purchased forty Pounds a Year If I had  died in  Guiana  I had not left Marks a Year to my Wife and Son I that have always condemn'd the  Spanish  Faction methinks it is a strange Thing that now I should affect it Remember what St  Austing  says  Sic judicate tanquam ab alio mox judicandi unus judex unum tribunal  If you would be contented on Presumptions to be delivered up to be slaughter'd to have your Wives and Children turned into the Streets to beg their Bread if you would be contented to be so judged judge so of me  Serj Philips  I hope to make this so clear as that the Wit of Man shall have no Colour to answer it The Matter is Treason in the highest Degree the End to deprive the King of his Crown The particular Treasons are these  First  To raise up Rebellion and to effect that to procure Money to raise up Tumults in  Scotland  by divulging a treasonable Book against the King's Right to the Crown the Purpose to take the Life of his Majesty and his Issue My Lord  Cobham  confesseth Sir  Walter Ralegh  to be guilty of all these Treasons The Question is Whether he be guilty as joining with him or instigating of him The Course to prove this was by my Lord  Cobham  's Accusation If that be true he is guilty if not he is clear So whether  Cobham  say true or  Ralegh  That is the Question  Ralegh  hath no Answer but the Shadow of as much Wit as the Wit of Man can devise He useth his bare Denial the Denial of a Defendant must not move the Jury In the  StarChamber  or in the  Chancery  for Matter of Title if the Defendant be called in Question his Denial on his Oath is no Evidence to the Court to clear him he doth it in  propria Causa  Therefore much less in Matters of Treason  Cobham  's Testisication against him before then and since hath been largely discoursed  Ralegh  If Truth be constant and Constancy be in Truth Why hath he forsworn that that he hath said You have not proved any one Thing by direct Prooss but all by Circumstances  Attorney  Have you done The King must have the last  Ralegh  Nay Mr  Attorney  he which speaketh for his Life must speak last False Repetitions and Mistakings must not mar my Cause You should speak  secundum allegata probata  I appeal to God and the King in this Point Whether  Cobham  's Accusation be sufficient to condemn me  Atterney  The King's Safety and your Clearing cannot agree I protest before God I never knew a clearer Treason  Ralegh  I never had Intelligence with  Cobham  since I came to the  Tower  Attorney  Go too I will lay thee upon thy Back for the confidentest Traytor that ever came at a Bar Why should you take Crowns for a Peace  Lord Cecil  Be not so impatient good Mr  Attorney  give him Leave to speak  Attorney  If I may not be patiently hcard you will encourage Traytors and discourage us I am the King's sworn Servant and must speak if he be guilty he is a Traytor if not deliver him  Note  Here Mr  Attorney  sat down and would speak no more until the Commissioners urged and intreated him After much ado he went on and madc a long Repetitiom of all the Evidence for the Direction of the Jury and at the repeating of some Things Sir  Walter Ralegh  interrupted him and said  He did him wrong  Attorney  Thou art the most vile and execrable Traytor that ever lived  Ralegh  You speak indiscreetly barbarously and uncivilly  Attorney  I want Words sufficient to express thy viperous Treasons  Ralegh  I think you want Words indeed for you have spoken one Thing half a dozen Times  Attorney  Thou art an odious Fellow thy Name is hateful to all the Realm of  England  for thy Pride  Ralegh  It will go near to prove a measuring Cast between you and me Mr  Attorney  Attorney  Well I will now make it appear to the World that there never lived a viler Viper upon the Face of the Earth than thou  and therewithal drew a Letter out of his Pocket saying further  My Lords you shall see this is an Agent that hath writ a Treatise against the  Spaniard  and hath ever so detested him this is he that hath spent so much Money against him in Service and yet you shall all see whether his Heart be not wholly  Spanish  The Lord  Cobham  who of his own Nature was a good and honourable Gentleman till overtaken by this Wretch now finding his Conscience heavily burthened with some Courses which the Subtilty of this Traytor had drawn him into my Lords he could not be at Rest with himself nor quiet in his Thoughts until he was eased of that heavy Weight out of which Passion of his Mind and Discharge of his Duty to his Prince and his Conscience to God taking it upon his Salvation that he wrote nothing but the Truth with his own Hands he wrote this Letter Now Sir you shall see whether you had Intelligence with  Cobham  within four Days before he came to the  Tower  If he be wholly  Spanish  that desired a Pension of Pounds a Year from  Spain  that  Spain  by him might have Intelligence then  Ralegh  is a Traytor He hath taken an Apple and pinned a Letter unto it and threw it into my Lord  Cobham  's Window the Contents whereof were this  It is doubtful whether  we shall be proceeded with or no perhaps you shall not be tried  This was to get a Retractation Oh it was  Adam  's Apple whereby the Devil did deceive him Further he wrote thus  Do not as my Lord of  Essex  did take heed of a Preacher for by his Persuasion be confessed and made himself guilty  I doubt not but this Day God shall have as great a Conquest by this Traytor and the Son of God shall be as much glorified as when it was said  Vicisti Galileae  you know my Meaning What tho'  Cobham  retracted yet he could not rest nor sleep until he had confirmed it again If this be not enough to prove him a Traytor the King my Master shall not live three Years to an End  Nota  Here Mr  Attorney  produced the Lord  Cobham  's Letter writ to the Commissioners the Night before  Ralegh  's Trial  viz Nov  and as he read it inserted some Speeches  I have thought it fit to set down this to my Lords wherein I profess on my Soul to write nothing but the Truth I am come new near to the Period of my Time therefore I confess the Truth before God and his Angels  Ralegh  four Days before I came to the  Tower  caused an Apple  Eve's Apple  to be thrown in at my Chamber window the Effect of it was to intreat me to right the Wrong that I had done him in saying That I should have come home by  Jersey  which under my Hand to him I have retracted His first Letter I answered not which was thrown in the same Manner wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter which I did He sent me Word that the Judges were at Mr  Attorney  's House and that there was good Hope the Proceedings against us should be staid he sent me another Time a little Tobacco At  Aremberg  's coming  Ralegh  dealt with me to procure him a Pension of    Pounds a Year for which he promised that no Action should be against  Spain  but he would give Knowledge beforehand He  told me the  States  had Audience with the King  Ah is not this a  Spanish  Heart in an  English  Body  He hath been the original Cause of my Ruin for I had no Dealing with  Aremberg  but by his Instigation He hath been also the Cause of my Discontentment he advised me not to be overtaken with Preachers as  Essex  was and that the King would better allow of a constant Denial than to accuse any  Attorney  O damnable Atheist he hath learned some Text of Scripture to serve his own Purpose but falsly alledged He counsels him not to be counselled by Preachers as  Essex  was He died the Child of God God honoured him at his Death Thou wast by when he died  Et Lupus turpes instant morientibus Ursae  He died indeed for his Offence The King himself spake these Words  He that shall say  Essex  died not for Trea on is punishable  Ralegh  You have heard a strange Tale of a strange Man now he thinks he hath Matter enough to destroy me but the King and all of you shall witness by our Deaths which of us was the Ruin of the other I bid a poor Fellow throw in the Letter at his Window written to this Purpose  You know you have undone me now write three Lines to justify me  In this I will die that he hath done me Wrong Why did not he acquaint me with his Treasons if I acquainted him with my Dispositions  Attorney  But what say you now of the Letter and the Pension of  l per Annum  Ralegh  I say that  Cobham  is a base dishonourable poor Soul  Attorney  Is he base I return it into thy Throat on his Behalf But for thee he had been a good Subject  Lord Chief Justice  I perceive thou art not so clear a Man as you have protested all this while for you should have discovered these Matters to the King  Nota  Here  Ralegh  pulled a Letter out of his Pocket which the Lord  Cobham  had written to him but a few Days before he wrote that above to the Lords and desired my Lord  Cecil  to read it because be only knew his Hand the Effect of it was as followeth  Cobham  's Letter of Justification to  Ralegh  Seeing myself so near my End for the Discharge of my own Conscience and freeing myself from your Blood which else will cry Vengeance against me I protest upon my Salvation I never practised with  Spain  by your Procurement God so comfort me in this my Affliction as you are a true Subject for any Thing that I know I will say as  Daniel Purus sum a sanguine hujus  So God have Mercy on my Soul as I know no Treason by you  Ralegh  Now I wonder how many Souls this Man hath He damns one in this Letter and another in that  Here was much ado Mr  Attorney  alledged that his last Letter was politickly and cunningly urged from the Lord  Cobham  and that the first was simply the Truth and that lest it should seem doubtful that the first Letter was drawn from the Lord  Cobham  by Promise of Mercy or Hope of Favour the  Lord Chief Justice  willed that the Jury might herein be satisfied Whereupon the Earl of  Devonshire  delivered that the same was merely voluntary and not extracted from the Lord  Cobham upon any Hopes or Promise of Pardon  Nota  This was the last Evidence whereupon a Marshal was sworn to keep the Jury private The Jury departed and staid not a Quarter of  an Hour but returned and gave their Verdict  Guilty  Serj Hele  demanded Judgment against the Prisoner  Clerk of the Crown  Sir  Walter Ralegh  Thou hast been indicted arraigned and pleaded not guilty for all these several Treasons and for Trial thereof hast put thyself upon thy Country which Country are these who have found thee Guilty What canst thou say for thyself why Judgment and Execution of Death should not pass against thee  Ralegh  My Lords The Jury have found me Guilty They must do as they are directed I can say nothing why Judgment should not proceed You see whereof  Cobham  hath accused me You remember his Protestations that I was never Guilty I desire the King should know of the Wrongs done unto me since I came hither  Lord Chief Justice  You have had no Wrong Sir  Walter  Ralegh  Yes of Mr  Attorney  I desire my Lords to remember three Things to the King I was accused to be a Practiser for  Spain  I never knew that my Lord  Cobham  meant to go thither I will ask no Mercy at the King's Hands if he will affirm it I never knew of the Practice with  Arabella  I never knew of my Lord  Cobham  's Practice with  Aremberg  nor of the surprising Treason  Lord Chief Justice  In my Conscience I am persuaded that  Cobham  hath accused you truly You cannot deny but that you were dealt with to have a Pension to be a Spy for  Spain  therefore you are not so true to the King as you have protested yourself to be  Ralegh  I submit myself to the King's Mercy I know his Mercy is greater than my Offence I  recommend my Wife and Son of tender Years unbrought up to his Compassion  Lord Chief Justice  I had thought I should never have seen this Day to have stood in this Place to give Sentence of Death against you because I thought it impossible that one of so great Parts should have fallen so grievously God hath bestowed on you many Benefits You had been a Man fit and able to have served the King in good Place You had brought yourself into a good State of Living If you had entered into a good Consideration of your Estate and not suffered your own Wit to have entrapped yourself you might have lived in good Comfort It is best for Man not to seek to climb too high lest he fall nor yet to creep too low lest he be trodden on It was the Posie of the wisest and greatest Counsellor of his Time in  England In medio spatio mediocria firma locantur  You might have lived well with  l  a Year for so I have heard your Revenues to be I know nothing might move you to be discontented but if you had been down you know Fortune's Wheel when it is turned about riseth again I never heard that the King took away any Thing from you but the Captainship of the Guard which he did with good Reasons to have one of his own Knowledge whom he might trust in that Place You have been taken for a wise Man and so have shewed Wit enough this Day Again for Monopolies for Wine c If the King said  It is a Matter that offends my People should I burthen them for your particular good  I think you could not well take it hardly that his Subjects were eased tho' by your private Hindrance Two Vices have lodged chiefly in you one is an eager Ambition the other corrupt Covetousness Ambition in desiring to be advanced to equal Grace and Favour as you have been before time that Grace you had then you got  not in a Day or Year For your Covetousness I am sorry to hear that a Gentleman of your Wealth should become a base Spy for the Enemy which is the vilest of all other wherein on my Conscience  Cobham  hath said true By it you would have increased your Living  l  a Year This Covetousness is like a Canker that eats the Ironplace where it lives Your Case being thus let it not grieve you if I speak a little out of Zeal and Love to your Good You have been taxed by the World with the Defence of most heathenish and blasphemous Opinions which I list not to repeat because Christian Ears cannot endure to hear them nor the Authors and Maintainers of them be suffered to live in any Christian Commonwealth You know what Men said of  Harpool  You shall do well before you go out of the World to give Satisfaction therein and not to die with these Imputations on you Let not any Devil persuade you to think there is no Eternity in Heaven if you think thus you shall find Eternity in Hellfire In the first Accusation of my Lord  Cobham  I observed his Manner of speaking I protest before the Living God I am persuaded he spoke nothing but the Truth You wrote that he should not in any Case confess any Thing to a Preacher telling him an Example of my Lord of  Essex  that noble Earl that is gone who if he had not been carried away with others had lived in Honour to this Day among us He confessed his Offences and obtained Mercy of the Lord for I am verily persuaded in my Heart he died a worthy Servant of God Your Conceit of not confessing any Thing is very inhuman and wicked In this World is the Time of confessing that we may be absolved at the Day of Judgment You have shewed a fearful Sign of denying God in advising a Man not to confess It now comes in my Mind why you may not have  your Accuser Face to Face for such a one is easily brought to retract when he seeth there is no Hope of his own Life It is dangerous that any Traytors should have any Accefs one to another or Conference when they see themselves must die they will think it best to see their Fellow live that he may commit the like Treason again and so in some Sort seek Revenge  Now it resteth to pronounce the Judgment which I wish you had not been this Day to have received of me For if the Fear of God in you had been answerable to your other great Parts you might have lived to have been a singular good Subject I never saw the like Trial and I hope I shall never see the like again  The  JUDGMENT  But since you have been found guilty of these horrible Treasons the Judgment of the Court is that you shall be had from hence to the Place whence you came there to remain until the Day of Execution and from thence you shall be drawn upon a Hurdle through the open Streets to the Place of Execution there to be hanged and cut down alive and your Body shall be opened your Heart and Bowels plucked out and your PrivyMembers cut off and thrown into the Fire before your Eyes then your Head to be strucken off from your Body which shall be divided into four Quarters to be disposed of at the King's Pleasure And God have Mercy upon your Soul  FINIS
