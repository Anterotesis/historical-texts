NATURAL PATRONS OF THIS WORK THE FOLLOWING HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS ARE MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY THEIR VERY OBLIGED AND MOST DEVOTED FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT  THE AUTHOR  LONDON  March  st  PREFACE  EVERY work on the subject of Topography founded on au∣thentic records and executed with accuracy and fidelity has a natural claim upon the patronage of that particular place or district of which it treats The following may in some degree boast of more extensive pretensions two considerations making an History of Newcastle upon Tyne of general and national im∣portance its situation not far from the borders of Scotland which rendered it one of the principal frontier towns during the hostilities with the sister kingdom and since that unhappy time its extensive coal trade  The oldest printed account of that place is a small book in quarto consisting of thirtyfour pages and intitled "Chorogra∣phia or a Survey of Newcastle upon Tyne c Newcastle printed by S B S P D dilectis Burgensibus et probis Hominibus Novi Castri super Tinam W G"  The last letters stand for the initials of William Grey of whom I have not been able to recover any particulars The Greys of Backworth in Northumberland are said to be of the same family This work an imperfect outline but which is extremely scarce was reprinted in the Harleian Miscellanies vol iii in with some additional remarks  Another small quarto volume on the same subject very rarely to be met with is intitled "England's Greivance discovered in relation to the Coal Trade with the map of the river of Tyne and situation of the town and corporation of Newcastle c by Ralph Gardiner of Chriton Chirton in the county of Northum∣berland Gent London " It is dedicated to the Lord Protector Cromwell consists of two hundred and eleven pages and is ornamented with the heads of several kings and queens of England The author appears to have been a most pointed enemy to the magistrates of Newcastle  The mayor and corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne in their answer to the com∣plaint of Ralph Gardiner to the committee appointed for trade c a MS which I have read expressly say that that writer "broke the goale of Newcastle last summer being there imprisoned for divers great sums of money and again imprisoned at the suit of the sheriff of the said town" and to this they attribute his malicious charge  The MS Life of Alderman Barnes which I shall often have occasion to cite in a note p informs us that "upon some methods agreed on for reformation of man∣ners in the town according to that clause in the charter which impowers them to make be laws there was one Gardiner writ a malicious invective against the government of Newcastle but he got his reward being afterwards at York hanged for coyning"  Chirton where he lived is a village east of Newcastle near the town of Sheilds "He was" says Bourne "a bitter enemy to this town and did all the mischief to it that lay in his power as appears in every page of his book in which are numbers of falsities"  From each of these curious tracts I have adopted in the subsequent collections what∣ever I thought worthy of being preserved  With regard to MS authorities I shall constantly refer my readers to the great national repositoriesthe Heralds' and Aug∣mentation Offices the British Museum the Rolls' Chapel and the Tower of London  The Bodleian library at Oxford the public library and those of Trinity and Bennet Colleges in the university of Cambridge were open to my inspection  I found a very copious source of unedited materials in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne  Permission was granted to me in the most liberal manner by the late John Baker Esq alderman of that town during his last mayoralty to inspect all the records with liberty at the same time to make what extracts I thought proper    My honoured patron the Duke of Northumberland conde∣scended to allow me the liberty of perusing and extracting what∣ever I found to my purpose from many of the valuable records of his illustrious house  I was indulged with the free use of a MS collection intitled "An Abstract in order of Time of the Charters and other Records concerning the Town of Newcastle upon Tyne"  It appears to have belonged to some former recorder or townclerk but comes no lower down than the fifth year of the reign of King Charles the First  I cite this under the name of "the Aubone MS" it having belonged to the late Mr Aubone secretary to the TrinityHouse A copy of it taken by Mr Aubone's permission is preserved in the library of John Erasmus Blackett Esq alderman of New∣castle  That gentleman used his utmost endeavours but without success to obtain for me a sight of the Milbank MS so often quoted by Bourne    I have derived very considerable information from a MS in folio which I call "the Murray MS" having received the loan of it from a gentleman  Mr George Parker  to whom it was bequeathed by the late Mr James Murray attorney at law  Mr Murray served his clerkship to Mr Ord attorney at law in NewcastleHe was afterwards in the townclerk's officeThe MS devolved to him on the death of Mr Ord I have some reasons for thinking that the greatest part of this collection was made by Sir Robert Shaftoe on  recorder of Newcastle Mr Murray died in See Inscriptions in St Andrew's churchyard in the following work  It is written in various hands and evidently at different periods so that probably it has also been the property of some former recorder or townclerk  I was favoured with the perusal of a curious MS by the pre∣sent possessor John Medley Esq alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne It is intitled "A Catalogue of all the Mayors and She∣riffs of his Majesty's Towne and Countye of Newcastle upon Tyne with their Coats of Armes and the Reignes of the several  Kinges and Queens of this Land with certain Briefs of Chronicles that happened in their several Reigns since Anno Domini " I call this throughout the following work "the Carr MS" as it appears to have owed its preservation to one of that family The subsequent inscription is stamped in golden letters on the binding "Robert Carre Esq St Helen Auckland " with the family arms viz gules on a chevron argent three mullets fable This is doubtless the identical MS mentioned by Bourne in page of his History of Newcastle  In the Introduction to the first volume of the Archaeologia p notes it is said that Mr Elstob son of Ralph Elstob merchant at Newcastle upon Tyne who was born in fellow of University College Oxford and died rector of the united parishes of St Swithin and St Mary Botham in London collected for an History of New∣castle but what is become of the MS is not known  For this collection I made every inquiry but in vain    I have occasionally made considerable use of a MS "Life of Ambrose Barnes merchant and sometime alderman of New∣castle" It is in folio closely written with a dedication to Sir Theodore Talbot It contains several curious anecdotes but the writer whoever he was appears to have been deeply tinctured both with religious and political fanaticism  The dedication signed with the initials M R is dated June th  From Bourne's History of Newcastle upon Tyne a thin folio volume which was published three years after the death of the author A D a circumstance which both apologizes and accounts for the various contradictions with which it abounds I have selected whatever I thought authentic and interesting to my subject  In the Newcastle Courant for November th are inserted Mr Bourne's proposals for publishing this work by subscription He had advertised for materials in the same Courant for September th  The posthumous work was advertised ibid April th to be delivered to the subscribers on the d of May following  Mr Bourne after a very lingering illness died about four o'clock in the afternoon of February th    George Allan Esq F S A of Darlington in the county of Durham favoured me in the most liberal and polite manner with the loan of several volumes of MSS copied from original records remaining in the church of Durham and which had been bequeathed to him by the indefatigable transcriber the Rev Mr Randall late of that city with liberty of making such ex∣tracts as I should think proper I cite these passim by the title of "Randall's MSS  Dr Hunter of Durham often mentioned with respect by the learned Mr Horsley in his Britannia Romana transcribed a great number of records relating to Newcastle upon Tyne from the archives of the church of Durham as I gather from Randall's MSS and sold a copy of Bourne's History aforesaid with these transcripts interleaved to Mr Akenhead bookseller at Newcastle for five guineas in This collection was the groundwork of Mr Akenhead's engaging in the design to publish an History of Newcastle for which he gave out proposals not long after the above purchase This intended work was however never published nor could I by any means procure a sight of the interleaved copy of Bourne's History but I have every reason to think that I found transcripts of the same records in Randall's MSS Mr Akenhead's proposals for printing by subscription a History of Newcastle upon Tyne in two volumes in quarto were published in the Newcastle Journal some time in the year  "  I selected some very interesting materials from the MS collec∣tions of the late George Grey of Newcastle upon Tyne Esq barrister at law all of which together with his library had been sold by his executors to Mr Robert Harrison formerly of that town of whom they were purchased with several notes extracts and references to books concerning the same place which he himself had made and collected in the course of his very extensive reading for the use of the following work  Vicinity and other circumstances once tempted me to hope that in the course of my progress in it I should have profited much by his judicious observations but from the circumstance of his removing to the south of England and of my leaving the north before his return my expectations on that head were en∣tirely frustrated  Sir Matthew White Ridley Bart governor of the Merchants' Company indulged me in the politest manner with the liberty of inspecting the records of that society  Alexander Adams Esq steward of the Hostmen's Company did me a similar favour with respect to those of that fraternity  I am indebted to John Erasmus Blackett Esq for the loan of a curious MS collection of pedigrees c which formerly be∣longed to the Calverley family and to their late most respectable representative Sir Walter Blackett Bart  I owe the perusal of Dr Ellison's MS collections with many other attentions to the kindness of his grandson the Rev Natha∣niel Ellison M A vicar of Bolam in Northumberland and lec∣turer of St Andrew's in Newcastle upon Tyne  The late George Stephenson Esq procured me leave to inspect the old books and other records of the TrinityHouse of that town  Liberty to examine and collect notes from the parish registers was granted me in the most friendly manner by the several clergy and keepers of the registers in Newcastle and Gateshead  I must not omit to mention that a collection of neat drawings of monuments arms c in the several churches of Newcastle was purchased of Mr Lambert formerly clerk to the recorder of Newcastle for the use of this work and had the copies of the inscrip∣tions on the monuments been as accurate as they ought to have been they would have anticipated a great deal of my most ungrateful labour    I owe acknowledgments for permission to inspect several antient MSS curious deeds c to Thomas Astle Esq F R S and S A keeper of the records in the Tower of London to John Topham Esq F R S and S A of the State Paper Office to Craven Ord Esq F R S and S A of the Exchequer to John Caley Esq keeper of the records in the Augmentation Office  For various communications in the course of the following work I stand indebted to Charles Coombe M D F R S and S A to the Rev Mr Penneck F R S the Rev Mr  Southcote and the Rev Mr Ascough of the British Museum to Mrs Adair formerly Miss Shaftoe of Benwell Lodge in the county of Northumberland to Hugh Hornby Esq alder∣man of Newcastle upon Tyne to John Davidson Esq clerk of the peace for the county of Northumberland to Nathaniel Clayton Esq townclerk and

law in Newcastle to Robert Page Esq deputy comptroller of the CustomHouse of that place to Mr Ralph Beilby and Mr Richard Fisher of the same town  To the several stewards of the incorporated companies of Newcastle I was obliged for the liberty of searching in their respective archives for their ordinaries and other antient writings  I shall just barely mention that the late Rev Mr James Murray a dissenting minister in Newcastle undertook some time before his death to compile a history of that town but having no means of procuring any other information on the subject than was to be obtained from printed books his design came to nothing  From motives of delicacy I contented myself with this account of his MS from those who perused it declining for very obvious reason to read a line of it myself  There is a brief history of Newcastle included in Wallis's History of Northumberland and in Hutchinson's View of the same county    After pleading in excuse for the rough and unpolished style of the following collections the rudeness of my materials deduced from the records of barbarous ages corrupted in many places by the ignorance and inattention of former tran∣scribers I shall conclude in the language of the learned pre∣late Dr White Kennet  "If the present age be too much immersed in pleasures to take any relish or to make any use of these discoveries I then appeal to posterity for I believe the times will come  when persons of better inclination will arise who will be glad to find any collections of this nature and to supply the defects and carry on the continuation of itI am under no concern to vindicate it from the slights and ridicule that may be cast upon it by idle witty his Lordship might have added ignorant people who think all history to be scraps and all antiquity to be rust and rubbish" Or in that of the great Camden in the preface to the Latin edition of his Britannia  "Si qui sint qui in urbe sua hospites in patria sua pere∣grini et cognitione semper pueri esse velint sibi per me pla∣ceant sibi dormiant non ego illis haec conscripsi non illis vigilavi"  LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS  A  GAWEN Aynsley Esq Little Harle Tower  James Allgood Esq Nunwick  Henry Askew

Newcastle is that in Speed's Map of Northumber∣land See a facsimile copy of this in a corner of the new plan that accompanies this work It was described by William Mathew who is mentioned in an inquisition th James I in the account of the castle about the year  A D a Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne dedicated to Matthew Featherstone∣haugh mayor the aldermen sheriff and common council of that town was published in two sheets with twentysix views of publick buildings by James Corbridge  The plan prefixed to Bourne's History published in is without any engraver's name and seems only a copy of the above with additions and improvements  Gough in his British Topography Vol II p tells us he was informed that "a very correct plan of Newcastle was taken soon after the rebellion by order and at the expence of the late Duke of Cumberland and is now in the hands of Mr Thompson who drew it" I inquired of Mr Thompson's son but could neither learn of him whether ever such a plan had been taken nor into whose hands it had fallen  A most correct plan of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead taken from an actual survey finished in the year engraved in two sheets by J Ellis was published by Charles Hutton mathematician  Thoresby in his Ducatus Leodensis p mentions a  Prospect  he had of Newcastle drawn by Mr William Lodge of Leeds who was born in and died  A south prospect of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne taken from the top of GatesheadChurchsteeple by Samuel Buck was engraved and published in the month of April  A large northeast view of Newcastle was published by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck  Grey in his Chorographia p tells us that Camden makes Newcastle upon Tyne grad min longitude grad min latitude and that Hues makes it grad min longitude grad min latitude  According to Dr Hutton's plan it stands precisely in degrees of north latitude and about ° ′ longitude west from London  CHURCHES MONASTERIES BRIDGES AND OTHER PUBLICK EDIFICES IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE  HARDYNG in his Chronicle informs us that Newcastle upon Tyne was inclosed with a wall during the reign of William Rufus  See History of Newcastle as a borough town under that reign His words are  "The towne to builde and walle as did append  He gave theim ground and golde ful great to spend  To builde it well and wall it all aboute c  "  That part of the wall near St Andrew'sChurch which is of a more antique fashion than the rest may perhaps be a specimen of the earliest and original walls of Newcastleit extends from NewGate to EverTower    In a charter of King John to that town dated January th express mention occurs of the walls thereof  See History of the Merchants AdventurersThe words are "Et quod nullus eorum qui fuerit infra gildam suam mercatoriam placitet extra muros Novi Castri"    In a grant from the King to the BlackFriars of Newcastle dated Sept th the west part of the present wall of that town near the house of that order is called the NewWall  To have a passage into their gardenThe words are "Quod per medium novum murum circumagentem villam predictam quem per medium gardini predictorum fratrum fieri oportebit c" See afterwards in the account of that house The wall appears to have been finished a year or two afterwards by the subsequent extract from the Aubone MS "A D th Ed I Upon a writ of ad quod damnum inquiry was made before the mayor and bailiffs of Newcastle whether there were between the townwall and the house of the friars preachers there a place called the King'sPlace And it was found that there was such a place purchased the last year of the issues and profits of the murage upon part of which the wall was built and part left for necessary carriages unto it which is called the void place and is necessary for the defence thereof"  Among the writings preserved in the hutch or common treasury of Newcastle A D was one intitled "A grant for building the walls of the town" The original is now lost and the date has not been transmitted    Most respectfully inscribed  Hugh H  rn  y Esq  An inside View of part of the TOWN WALL of Newcastle upon  S  t  Andrew's Church between Newgate and Westgate  In a record dated May th the building anew of

prisoner by the Scottes out of the town self as it is re∣ported Hereupon he was raunsomed for a great sum and returning home he beganne to make a waulle on the ripe of Tyne ryver from SandHille to PandonGate and beyond that to the tower agayne the AugustineFreres"He afterwards says the walls were not en∣tirely finished till Edward the Third's timeIndeed he speaks merely from the report of others who plainly appear to have known nothing of the matterHe adds "The strength and magnificens of the waulling of this towne far passith al the waulles of the cities of England and most of the townes of Europe"  The following I extracted from a MS in the Cotton Library Julius F "Edwardo primo regnante civis Novocastrensis vir opulentissimus ex ipso oppido in Scotiam abductus fuit qui demum pretio redemptus Novocastr' muro primus circumdare coepit quod reliqui cives imitati Edwardo Tertio regnante firmissimo muro circumdedit"  of Newcastle on the side towards the east occurs  A grant to the Carmelites to remove from Wallknoll to another site"Eo quod murus ejusdem villae de novo constructus per medium clausi ipsorum c" See account of WhiteFriars  this was in all probability occasioned

Whereas the mayor aldermen sheriff and common council of the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne in council assembled did some time since present to his Majesty at the Board an humble petition setting forth that the ancient wall of the said town from the SandHill to the SandGateGate is not of any use for defence and being on the key where all goods are landed and shipped off is a very great obstruction to carriages and a hindrance to the dispatch of business and humbly praying that his Ma∣jesty would be graciously pleased to grant them leave to remove the said wall at their own expences and to make use of the stones and other materials for building a church and whereas the Lords of the Committee of Council to whom his Majesty was pleased to refer the consideration of the said petition have this day reported as their opinion that it may be adviseable for his Majesty to comply with the petitioners' request his Majesty taking the same into consideration was pleased with the advice of his privy council to ap∣prove thereof and doth hereby give power and authority to the petitioners to remove the said wall provided the same be done at their own expence and to make use of the stones and other materials for building a church as is desiredWhereof all persons concerned are to take notice and govern themselves accordingly  HEN FANE    FOSS  THE Foss or Ditch that has anciently surrounded the walls of Newcastle is in most places at present filled up and made level with the adjoining ground The space however which it occupied is still called "The King'sDikes" It appears to have been uniformly of the breadth of twentytwo yards or a chain It is claimed as the pro∣perty of the corporation to whom every waste within their jurisdiction devolves by the authority of

security of the town against the rebels  and round towers in them which were wont to be defended in times of hostility with the Scots by the particular wards appropriated to them  There was a turret

still remaining It has been made use of successively as a meetinghouse for the companies of housecarpenters and sailmakers  The CloseGate  "CloseYate" says a curious account of the wards preserved in

westward upon the NorthRawe unto the CloseYate"  which since the fall of TyneBridge in has been converted into a temporary prison has evidently had its name from the street called the Close both sides of which it had in ward as far as the place called JavelGrip From the CloseGate there are an hundred and forty steps on the top of the wall as it mounts a very steep hill to WhiteFriarTower at the distance of sixtynine yards and one footThe common name of these  i e  the BreakNeckStairs is of very obvious etymology  WhiteFriarTower was so called from the adjoining house of the Carmelites or

the company of wallers bricklayers and plaisterersSee account of that society  probably derives the first of these appel∣lations from the same person that gave a name to the lane called DentonChareAs it undoubtedly does the second from the Nevil family whose townhouse called WestmorelandPlace stood near and is said to have communicated with it by a subterraneous passage  From the PosternGate  On the wall over the PosternGate is the following inscription "The walls were repaired and fortified for the defence of this town against the rebels A D Cuthbert Smith Esquire Mayor Henry Partis Esq Sheriff"  Bourne supposes this postern in the wall to have been an outlet to the White Friars that they might walk to the Forth and the neighbouring fields and that it might be of use to the castle in times of hostility with the Scots He imagines also this to have been the gate out at which the townsmen in the reign of Edward III to the number of three hun∣dred valiant men issued and came suddenly in the night upon a great army of the Scots which lay in the west part of the town and raised and put them to flight taking Earl Murray prisoner in his tent c See Historical Events Over this gate

NEWCASTLE upon TYNE  This gate consists of four wards and is said to have been built by Roger de Thornton a merchant who from small beginnings became equally distinguished for his wealth and munificence This place was formerly a prison for unruly apprentices and is at present the hall of the company of housecarpenters A foot way was opened out on the north side of this gate "Edward Mosley

all that dwell fro the said Kirk unto the WestYate"  Roger de Thornton is said to have come originally from the country west of Newcastle according to the old saying which Bourne gives as follows  "At the WestGate came Thornton in  With a hap and a halfpenny and a lambskin"  In Stow's transcript of Leland's Itinerary it is somewhat different  "In at the WestGate came Thornton in  With a happen hapt in a ram's skynn  He adds "This Roger Thornton was the richest marchant that ever was dwelling in Newcastell The isle and almost all the landes that the Lord Lomely hath in Yorkshire and Northumbreland were this Thornton's" Vol v p  Lord Lumley married his daughterThere is a tradition in the family that the de∣scendants of this great benefactor to the town were exempted from paying toll at the gates of Newcastle  Mention occurs of WestGate used for a prison in the following extract from Rush∣worth's Collections Part IV vol ii p "On Monday night last in the time of the storm all that were in WestGate in the town of Newcastle to the number of seventeen of the prisoners lately taken in Northumberland escaped away Having had friends come to visit them several times divers ropes were brought in to them which was not known till they were gone In the dark of the night when the storm was violent blew hard and much rain by the ropes let themselves down by a privy"  This happened about the beginning of August It appears that six of the chief of the prisoners that were in TinmouthCastle escaped at the same time letting themselves down through a privy built on the north side of the Castle with sheets sewed together  "  Leland calls this gate "a mightye strong thinge of four wardes and an yron gate"  From the WestGate to DurhamTower  "DurhamTower" says the MS so often cited

MS intitled "Lib' de Reb Novocastri' informs us that before the taking down of the top of the old tower it was much of the same size model and stone with the tower of Routchester in Northumberland which was certainly one of the towers belonging to the PictsWall"  Grey who wrote his Chorographia in speaking of the towers of the RomanWall says "One of these towers remaineth whole in the townewall

Carpenters' Tower to the farther side of SandGate  SandGate has evidently had its name from being built upon the sand on the side of the river  Bourne speaking of the towers on the walls of Newcastle informs us on the authority of the Milbank MS that "between every one of these towers there were for the most part two watch towers made square with the effigies of men cut in stone upon the tops of them as though they were watching and they were called Garret which had square holes over the walls to throw stones down"  the distance is two hundred and thirtytwo yards and one foot  The above measures are taken from a MS communicated by the late Mr Thomas Aubone intitled "The distance of the towers one from another with the breadth of their faces on the town'swall beginning at the

continues "is supplied with all kinds of provision from the very plentiful markets of the town here being used annually above beeves calves sheep and lambs with swine fish poultry eggs butter c in a

having nightly lamps in the streets  "October st Thursday night the lamps put up in the streets of this town were lighted up for the first time"This was in consequence of an act lately passed for lighting the streets and other places and maintaining a regular and nightly watch within the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and for regulating the hack∣ney coachmen and chairmen

beginning of the reign of King James Iand on the th of June they were incorporated by a royal charterSee the continuation of their common history under "St Mary Magdalen's Hospital"  From St Thomas' Chapel we enter upon  TYNEBRIDGE  THE proofs that a Roman bridge  Bourne tells us "The bridge is of great antiquity undoubtedly as old as the times of the Romans there must have been a communication between this and the other side of the river and therefore there was a necessity for it"The ingenious Mr Horsley p says "I think there are some certain and visible remains of a military way on GatesheadFell pointing directly towards the part where I suppose the station has been at New∣castle and coming as I apprehend from ChesterleStreet Dr Hunter assured me he had also observed visible remains of such a way And it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from ChesterleStreet to Newcastle This way tends towards the place where the bridge now is There must then have been a bridge in the Roman times over the river Tyne near the place where the present bridge stands" Thus far from BourneHorsley's words are p Romana Britannia"That Dr Hunter in∣formed him that "he had observed a military way going off from WatlingStreet near Binchester which he Dr H supposed went to ChesterontheStreet between Durham and Newcastle he traced it to BranspethPark but could find it no farther" He adds p "That the name of ChesterontheStreet does not a little confirm the opinion that there has been a Roman settlement there of some kind or other and that a military way has passed from Newcastle to it"He adds farther on this subject p "The gardener at Cousins'House told me that he had observed when he wrought thereabouts the military way from Newcastle to Chesterlestreet and that it lay to the west of the pre∣sent highway through the Fell And Dr Hunter was positive that he had observed the same way upon this Fell as also some remaining tracks of a via vicinalis beyond Chester between Binchester and BrancepethCastle as I remember pointing towards Chester which he therefore concluded must have gone that way"  Dr Stukeley in his Iter Boreale p speaking of Gateshead says "The Roman road here which is the true HermenStreet coming from Suffex coming down Gates∣headFell passes in a strait line to the bridge"  occupied either the same or nearly the same site with the present bridge at Newcastle appear  stronger than those generally are which are brought in confirmation of truths of such remote antiquity  Two eminent antiquaries  Mr Horsley author of the Britannia Romana and Dr Hunter of Durham  of this country to one of whom we owe the greatest part of our intelligence concerning Roman Britain were persuaded from visible remains existing in their time that there was a Roman road from Binchester through ChesterintheStreet to the site of the present Newcastle upon Tyne  An ancient Itinerary discovered since they wrote seems to confirm their account beyond the possibility of a doubt  The Itinerary of Richard of Cirencester discovered and first printed by Mr Bertram in Sweden We trace on the ancient map delineated in this very valuable acquisition to English antiquartes the Roman great road leading straight from Cataract in York∣shire to Binchester in the county of Durham where it branches out into two different iters one of which stretches towards Falkirk in Scotland by way of Ebchester Cor∣bridge c while the other passing through ChesterintheStreet terminates at the Roman wall at Newcastle upon Tyne  At Corbridge the remains of a Roman bridge are still visible  The very high antiquity of this Itinerary is said by Dr Stukeley to be marked out by such names as "ad Murumad Tesamad Alaunamad Tuedam" c shewing that the roads were generally made or marked out but that towns cities and castles were not then built only some inns for present conveniencyHe adds that we may reasonably judge from hence that the original Itinerary and Map which this Richard of Cirencester copied was constructed in Agricola's timethough afterwards additions were made to it Some have supposed that there was one of those inns at Gateshead called at that time from the sign of a goat's head "Caprae Caput"But see account of "Gateshead"    The Emperor Aelius Hadrian who connected the forts erected by Agricola by raising the great vallum that in this part of the island extended nearly from sea to sea was probably the first that built a bridge at this place from which circumstance the station it led to from the Roman road was afterwards called "Pons Aelii" an appellation plainly derived as were those of others of his publick works from the name of his own family  "Thus" says Pennant "Jerusalem was styled Aelia Capitolina" and the games he instituted at Pincum in Maesia "Aeliana Pincensia" It may be added that the bridge which Hadrian throw over the Tyber at Rome is called to this hour "Ponte Elio Adri∣ano" See Piranesi's Views  Two coins appear to have been struck upon the building of two bridges by this Em∣peror one is doubtless to be referred to that at Rome may not the other have been in∣tended to commemorate the work we are now considering One of the bridges marked on these coins has seven the other five arches The Tyber being a very inconsiderable river when compared with the Tyne we must therefore claim that with seven arches especially as we find a view of the Pons Aelius at Rome in Piranesi's Collection without the modern ornaments where it is represented as consisting of exactly five arches See Vaillant tom i p where speaking of the coins of Hadrian he thus describes one of them "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum septem fornicibus sub eo plurimae figurae" and the other p as follows "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum quinque forni∣cibus"Edition of Paris quarto  See also "Numismatum Antiquorum in Musaeo Pembrochiano Sylloges pars "    Many Roman coins  "I cannot help thinking" says Pennant Tour vol iii p "that part of the Roman bridge remained there till very lately for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers they seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches This was a manner of building used by the Romans witness the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan at Severin twenty Hungarian miles from Belgrade whose piers I be∣lieve still exist" Of the coins that were found Mr Pennant describes the following "Coins posterior to the time of Adrian probably deposited there in some later repairs One is a beautiful Faustina the Elder after her deificationher forehead is bound with a small tiaraher hair full twisted and dressed a la moderneround is inscribed "Diva Faustina" On the reverse is a Ceres with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other the inscription "Augusta S C"  "The next has the laureated head of Antoninus Piuson the reverse Apollo with a patera in one hand a plectrum in the otherthe legend defaced  "The third is of Lucius Verus after consecrationreverse a magnificent funeral pile and the word "Consecratio S C"The originals of these are in the possession of the Bishop of Durham"  I have one of Trajan found here alsoit is the same as that described in Thoresby's Leeds p N  o  as also one of Antoninus of the larger size  I have caused one of the Emperor Hadrian though much defaced to be engraved It was found in the same ruins and communicated by John Erasmus Blackett Esq alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne See plate of coins  were discovered in the ruins of the piers of  this bridge after the fall thereof A D proving it should seem that some of the original Roman structure remained here till every part of the ancient building was cleared away on the erection of the new bridge  Bourne's reasoning  His words are these "It has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone but I think it is altogether needless all the bridges in England were ori∣ginally of woodIn the reign of Richard I Philip Bishop of Durham sent to the bur∣gesses of Gateside a grant of forestage in which are these words "And it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the river of Tyne without any licence" This I imagine has been for the building of keys and especially for the repairing of the Bishop's part of the bridge which is a further proof that the bridge which was the original one was wood" See afterwards under "Gates∣head"  on the Bishop of Durham's charter to the bur∣gesses of Gateshead in the reign of Richard I is founded on an error in translating the passage he selected from the original LatinThe clause which he has either found wrong or made so ought to be ren∣dered as follows "Any burgess  i e  of Gateshead may give his wood to whom he pleases provided they live on this side of the Tyne" that is on the Durham side of that river  In a charter of King Henry II to the town of Newcastle cited in one of King John the existence of a bridge here at that period is implied in his exempting the burgesses from the duty of  pontage  for their own goods  See under that reign "History of Newcastle as a corporate town"    In the year the greatest part of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne together with the bridge there was destroyed by fire  "In Anglia etsi de aliis sileamus maxima pars burgi qui Novum Castrum super Thi∣nam appellatur cum ponte igne quasi suriosa consumpta est"  Matth Paris Watts Edit p    Bourne tells us without subjoining on what authority that after this event the town of Newcastle joined with the Bishop of Durham in erecting a bridge of stone  From his Liber CartarumLaurentius was then the master of the bridgeThe archdeacon of Northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry and desired them to assist the work of the bridge inforcing the command of the Bishop of Durham to set about the affair of indulgencies preferring the episcopal ones to othersIn like manner the official of Carlisle promised an indulgence of ten days to any one that would assist the repairing of Tyne Bridge  and that the business was effected by a method common at that time  i e  by sending indulgencies to all per∣sons who would assist them either with money or labour to rebuild it Here he first mentions that the Bishops of Durham were bound to repair a third part of TyneBridge  See the reasons for this in the History of the River Tyne    A D Simon de Shotton Robert de Seaton and Henry Gategang parson of Emildon occur as benefactors to this bridge  Bourne's History p    A D during the mayoralty of Henry de Carliol Robert Valesine gave an annual rent to the support of TyneBridge  Ibid    On the th of the kalends of October Walter Bishop of  Durham granted an indulgence  For the collection of the alms raised by indulgencies an officer was appointed who was styled the custos or guardian of the bridge This was often held with the mastership of the Hospital of St Thomas the Martyr  of twenty days to any person that would contribute to the reparation of TyneBridge  Bourne ut supra    On the ides of September Sewald Archbishop of York granted an indulgence of thirty days to come to every person bestow∣ing any thing towards the building and reparation of Tyne Bridge About the same time Andrew Bishop of Cathness in Scotland gave liberty by a grant to collect alms throughout his whole diocese for the reparation of TyneBridge  The Bishop of Waterford in Ireland granted also to those that would assist in the reparation of Tyne Bridge a promise of being prayed for in the cathedral church of the Holy Trinity in Waterford and the other churches of his diocese as also an indulgence for ten days  Bourne p  By this means considerable benefactions were procured  Ibid"John" he says "the son of Decanus and Bartholomew the son of Wil∣liam son of Benedict guardian of the alms collected for the support of the Tyne Bridge with the council and assent of the mayor bailiffs and burgesses confirmed to Gervasius the son of Ralph the whole land with every thing belonging to it in the fields of Jesemu∣thia which Henry de Bulmar and Ralph gave and by their charters confirmed to the said Tine Bridge c on condition that he rendered to the said Tyne Bridge one plank or six shillings annually at the feast of St Michael Adam de Jesemuthia was the first wit∣ness to this grant  "Adam de Jesumuthia

the guardian or master of the bridge four shillings at the terms agreed upon and gave to them and their heirs one rose at the Feast of the Nativity of St John Baptist" P from the Liber Cart' p    In

together with a tower which that body had lately caused to be erected thereupon  In a petition presented by Thomas Bishop of Durham to the King in Parliament in  asterTerm A D it was set forth that he and all his predecessors Bishops of Durham from this unmemorial had h  ld the county and liberty of Durham between the waters of Te  s and Tyne together with moieties of these waters and the soil of the said moieties of the waters a parcel of the county and liberty of which they had been seized all that time with the franchise jurisdiction and royalties in them as the right of their church of St Cuthbert of Durham peaceably and intirely As also a moiety of Tyne Bridge on their soil till the first of May when William Bishopdale mayor of Newcastle and the commonalty of that town began to build a tower on the bishop's part of the bridge at Gateshead and removed and carried into Newcastle two stones called St Cuthbert's Stones the ancient boundaries of the liberty aforesaid and which tower they occupied at that time The mayor and burgesses of Newcastle in vindica∣tion of their proceedings pretended they had authority for so doing in a charter dated February th in the th year of King JohnThe corporation of Newcastle it is need∣less to add were cast in this trial compelled to take back and replace St Cuthbert's Stones and give up the tower they had built together with their claim to the Bishop's right to a third part of this bridge of which seizin was made for the said bishop as above January th From a record in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne see also Wharton's Anglia Sacra p  The Aubone MS says "In the d of Henry V the Bishop of Durham had judg∣ment against the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle for removing his stones and incroach∣ing upon his liberties upon the third part of Tyne Bridge It appears in the little black book in the hutch under Hen V that the execution of the said judgment of the d Hen V was opposed when Sir Christopher Moresby sheriff of Westmoreland Sir Wil∣liam Claxton sheriff of Durham and others came to take seizin of the said onethird part of the bridge for the Bishop of Durham upon the false verdict as it is there called of the jurors of Westmoreland and Cumberland against the mayor and commonalty of Newcastle"  "The blue stone" on this bridge occurs in the commoncouncil books March d  Bourne speaking of this "blue stone" says "here is the boundary of Newcastle southwards"    In the year a recluse appears to have lived in a hermitage upon TyneBridge and was appointed by Roger Thornton in his will  This will is dated the Thursday before Christmas day "Item I will that the recluse of Newcastlebe parcel of the thirty priests cand the recluse six marks yearly ctill an hundred marks be dispended if they live so long"See Bourne under that year  That there was a hermitage on this bridge anciently appears from a deed remaining in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle dated November th "Her∣mitages" says Tanner in the preface to the Notitia Monastica p "were religious cells created in private and solitary places for single persons or communities many times endowed and sometimes annexed to larger religious houses"  one of the thirty priests he had ordered to sing for his soul with a bequest of six marks annually This year also the above  Roger Thornton left an hundred marks to the reparation of this bridge  See the will in Bourne ut supraon the following singular condition "if so that the mayor and commons will release me all actions as I that never hindered them nor nought awe them at my witting but this I desire for eschewing of clamour"    In an ordinary granted A D to the fullers and dyers of Newcastle half of a fine of twenty shillings imposed as the penalty

that  "Tyne Bridge had ten arches and a stronge warde and towre on it"  and that there was  "a gate at the bridge ende"  i e towards NewcastleBy this strong ward and tower must have been meant what was lately called  "the tower on the bridge"  and  an iron gate  which was beyond it towards the south and is marked in Speed's Plan of the town  "The gate at the bridge ende"  must have been a gate in the townwall perhaps considerably nearer to St Thomas' Chapel than the late magazinegate which had the date of upon it and Grey in his Chorographia published in mentions it as lately built  Bourne tells us "this bridge had once  twelve bold arches but now only nine  the rest being turned into cellaring at the building of the keys" describing it "as a pretty street beset with houses on each side" He adds "At the end of the bridge which leads into Gateside is another tower where has been a drawbridge"    About the year the very marvellous event related by Bourne and others concerning Mr Anderson's ring dropped by accident over this bridge as he was fingering it is supposed to have happened The part of the story which some have ventured to doubt the truth of is that this identical ring was brought back again after some time in a fish bought in Newcastle market by a servant of the above merchant and most unexpectedly restored to its owner  In the parchment fragment before mentioned supposed to have been stoler out of the archives of the corporation of Newcastle at the riot there in is entered by an after insertion an account of what is there called "Sir Francis Anderson's ring" under the year  Yet the writer of Vox Piscis or the Book Fish published in tells us p that this event "fell out in our memorie" to a "citizen of Newcastle whose name I take to be M Anderson"He does not mention the kind of fish in which the ring was found  In Grey's Chorographia M Anderson is styled an alderman and the fish called a salmon which some say is incapable of swallowing any thing so large as a ring See a story similar to this in Herodotus lib iii c In Littlebury's translation of that work it is in vol i p  There is another of the same kind related in the English Morery or Collier's Diction∣ary in verbo "Kentigern"  Fuller in his Worthies takes notice of this event referring in the margin to the Vox Piscis  Bourne tells us p "This gentleman from whose finger the ring fell was mayor of Newcastle and was ancestor of the present Mr Abraham Anderson merchant on the SandHill the said Francis Anderson made over his estate to his son Henry Anderson who was the father of the said Abraham's grandfather" He adds "On the inside of the ring just under the signet is the picture of a salmon in commemoration of the fish and the transaction on the one side of which is the letter F and on the other the letter A in commemoration of the person" calling it at the same time "A curiosity so great that not only the whole kingdom cannot shew the like of it but the whole world beside"  This ring is at present A D in the possession of Mr Edward Anderson mer∣chant who permitted me to take a drawing of it with an impression on wax of the sig∣net the engraving on which appears to me to be a Roman antique though Bourne says it represents Solomon and the Queen of ShebaThis Mr Edward Anderson is a de∣scendant of the person to whom the accident happened and has a deed of family property the seal of which exhibits an impression of the signet of this memorable ring and i  of a date prior to the supposed date of this most extraordinary but by no means incredible event See plate of Miscellaneous Antiquities N  o      A D an ordinary granted to the company of slaters and bricklayers directs that half of the penalty of ten shillings for any brother's invading the province of the wallers in working with black mortar or clay as also half of all the other fines of the company shall go to the maintenance of the great bridge of Newcastle  See "History of Companies"    February th a decree was made in the Exchequer that the Bishop of Durham for the time being and not the inhabitants of the county of Durham at large should repair the third part of this bridge  Aubone MS    In a deed preserved in the archives of Newcastle upon Tyne dated November th a tenement here is mentioned "as knowne by the name of the Ladies Chapell" This i  plainly a corruption of "our Lady's Chapel" and evinces that there was a chapel on TyneBridge in the Popish times dedicated to the Virgin Mary  It was on the east side of the pier next on the south to that whereon the tower of the bridge stood "In this tower" says Bourne "are kept lewd and disorderly persons till they are examined by the mayor and brought to due punishment except the crime be of a very gross nature and then are removed to NewGate and there continued till the assizes" There was a stone with the town's arms on it placed on the south front of this tower with the motto "F Fortiter defendit triumphans " It is at present built up in the garden wall of Hugh Hornby Esq alderman  In the MS Life of Alderman Barnes p is given a ludicrous account of one Harry Wallis a master shipwright who was so abusive to the said Alderman B that he committed him to the tower on the bridge where being enraged at the stone doublet which his rudeness had got him and finding a quantity of malt lying in the chamber where he was lodged the chamber standing over the Tyne he threw it out of the win∣dow with a shovel into the water and made the following verses on the occasion with such wit as his ale had inspired him with  "O base mault  Thou didst the fault  And into Tyne thou shalt"  There is thought to have been anciently a chapel in this tower also for on taking it down after the fall of the bridge in a stone coffin and a skeleton were found in it see Newcastle Courant for July th On the north side of this tower there was cut rudely in stone on a shield a Holy Lamb passant Arms attributed by Nesbit in his Heraldry to some northern bishop    In the commoncouncil books Dec d and July th mention occurs of the reparation of TyneBridge  It appears ibid March th that the late King  i e  Charles the First had allowed a portion of trees out of Chopwell Woods in the vicinity of Newcastle for the reparation of TyneBridge  The commoncouncil had directed that application should be made to the Parlia∣ment for forty trees there marked for the King's use to be employed in the said reparation    By authority of the ordinance for abolishing episcopacy two dif∣ferent sales one in the year

true liberty that defends every man's right or partie"  Grey's account of TyneBridge in his Chorographia published in is to the fol∣lowing effect "The bridge of this town over the river Tyne consisteth of arches high and broad having many houses and shops upon the bridge and three towers upon it the first on the south side the second in the middle and the third in Newcastle side lately built upon an arch in the bridge used for a magazine for the towne and an old chappell There is a blew stone about the middle of the bridge which is the bounds of Newcastle southward from Gateside in the county palatine of Durham" P    Soon after the restoration of King Charles II the arms of the commonwealth beforementioned were taken down from the said gate and their place supplied by the royal arms and a statue of the late restored King in a Roman habit with this motto "Adventus Regis solamen gregis"  i e  the coming of the King is the comfort of the people  There were the visible remains

part of TyneBridge where there had anciently been a drawbridge  "In July Richard Trevor Bishop of Durham repaired with stone one of the south arches of the TyneBridge then in decay having been made of

ruins of Tyne Bridge to prevent the passage of keels boats c through any other of the arches but the four that remained on the north side of the river  "The arches of the old bridge" says Hutton in his Plan of Newcastle dated January th "were of different figures some of them resembling Gothic ones and others scheme arches nor did the arches decrease regularly from the middle to the ends and the exceeding narrowness of the passage over it which was still more contracted by the houses built upon it rendered it exceedingly inconvenient"    January th the commoncouncil of Newcastle ordered a petition to be presented to the House of Commons for leave to bring in a bill for building a temporary bridge and also a bridge of stone over the river Tyne as also for monies to be granted them to defray the expences necessary for such a work  Commoncouncil books  A second petition from the same body and on the same subject occurs February th  Ibid This was signed by the mayor aldermen and

subscription was entered into for the support of a petition to Parliament against the building of the intended bridge over the Tyne at the JabelGroop"The subscription then amounted to upwards of fifty

between the town of Newcastle and Gateshead for completing the new stone bridge there and for making the avenue to and the passage over it more commodiousThis Act was to be continued for the term of three years and no longer No houses except toll shops were to be erected on the new bridge and the tolls were to be raised upon it for twelve years from June th  It appears by this act that the corporation of Newcastle had expended of their own money December th the sum of l s d including l s d the price of property on the old bridge and that it was supposed that before it was finished it would cost them l more It appears also that on the above th of December they had expended above the sum of l mentioned in the former Act for building the temporary bridge the sum of l s d more than the tolls on that tem∣porary bridge had produced nor was it expected that the money to be taken for tolls there from that time to June th would reimburse the overplus of expence  September th in the forenoon the sixth and last arch of that part of the new stone bridge belonging to the corporation of Newcastle was closedNewcastle Courant  November th the workmen began to pull down the houses on

enter the street called the Close  Bourne says "it was formerly the part of the town where the principal inhabitants lived Sir John Marley Sir William Blackett Sir Mark Milbank and the houses of many other gentlemen of figure are still remembered by the ancient inhabitants The houses within speak magnificence and grandeur the rooms being very large and stately and for the most part adorned with curious carving Of late" he adds "these houses have been forsaken and their wealthier inhabitants have chosen the higher parts of the town"  A deed now lies before me dated March st that mentions a waste tenement in this street lately belonging to Sir Thomas Ilderton Knight  A finely carved chimneypiece was removed a few years ago from Sir John Marley's house to that of Charles Williams Esq without the CloseGate  in which the chief merchants of the town had anciently their habitations and which probably had its name from its closeness or narrowness  The house of the Earls of Northumberland stood on the side of this street next to the river bounded on the east by BowerChare be∣twixt TyneBridge and JavilGroopApril th Henry Earl of Northumberland demised it to his servant George Bird by the name of the Earl's Inn under an annual rent of s d Bourne tells us that it stood on the site of a house having in his time "a great gate at its entrance with a large round ball of stone  Vulgo "The Round Stone Entry"  and that in the lower part of the building towards the water were very manifest tokens of its antiquity  "Henry Erle of Northumberlande Lorde of th'onor of

place is spelled "Ga∣bleGroope"In Bourne's History "JavillGripp" and in an inrolment in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle Sept "GavellGroop"  Groope or Grype signifies a ditch and Javel is said to be a corruption of gaol The castle of Newcastle was long the common prison of the county of Northumberland and here it is probable has been anciently the communication between the ditch or foss of the castle and the river Tyne  On the right hand after we have entered the Close  There were formerly two pants in the Closeone near the place called Aubone's Entry the other near the

nearly opposite the mansionhouse is a third flight of stairs called the TuthillStairs  Bourne's conjecture concerning the etymology of the name of this hill appears very erroneous "The proper name of it" says he "should be Touthill from the  ting or winding of a horn upon it when an enemy was at hand" It seems more probably to be a corruption of Toothill  i e  the Hill of Observation  Sir John

house anciently consisting of an hospital and chapel was founded in the reign of Henry the Second by one Aselack of Killing∣howe  Bourne p "Ego Aselack de Killinghowe fundavi hospitale Sanctae Mariae

hospitalis benefactorumLib Cart Some of the witnesses were "Gilbert parson of Eland Richard parson of Standfordham Waldon parson of Newburne Eustachius parson of Benton"  The words above "super terram meam fundavi" seem plainly to infer that he raised the structure from the ground although Bourne on the authority of the MS he so often cites and which he calls "Liber Cartarum" styles Aselack the second founder Having found in Cambden's Britannia a Lord Walter de Bolbeck conveying lands to the church of Winchester A D and one of the same name among the first benefactors to this place he thinks them one and the same person adding that "it is a strong reason that this hospital was founded in King Henry I's reign" Yet we find in Tanner's No∣titia Monastica p a Walter de Bolbeck founding the Abbey of Bl  nchland A D at or near the time it may be supposed of the first foundation of this house and to which that Baron may have been a benefactor before he was sixty years of age It may be added that what he has cited from the charter of Henry II to the m  ns of Newcastle favours out hypothesis as does also the confirmation charter to this house by Richard I mentioned afterwards in which Aselack the founder  poken of as then alive What Tanner in his Notitia Monastica has recorded concerning the different foundations of this house being only a transcript of Bourne's very confused account must necessarily follow the fortune of its original  who not only raised the fabric but gave the ground also upon which it was erected and placed therein two friars regular and  a chaplain to serve God and the poor farther intending it to be a place of entertainment for the indigent clergy and such pilgrims as were passing this way  This house has been called at different periods "The Hospital of Newcastle" See Bishop Pudsey's Charter to it and that of Henry II to the nuns"Of St Mary the blessed virgin of WestGate" see afterwards various records"of St Mary and St John the Evangelist" see a record from Bishop Langley's Register A D also "The WestSpittle" and since the Hospital of the Trinity which stood in an eastern extremity of the town has been generally forgotten "the Spittle" omitting the epithet which had clearly been used by way of contradistinction "Spital" is evidently a corrup∣tion of "Hospital"    Hugh Pudsey made Bishop of Durham A D and who died in the year granted a charter of episcopal confirmation to this hospital  "H Dei gratia Dunolm' Episcopus omnibus hominibus tocius episcopatus sui cle∣ricis et laicis Francis et Anglis salutem Sciatis

belonging sometime to a chantry of the Blessed Virgin in the church of St Nicholas on the west partthe highway on the north and the back walls of the said town of Newcastle on the south for years  From a paper now lying before me in an old handThe common street must mean here it should seem the narrow passage opposite to the new assemblyhouse leading from WestGate to the Forth having the town's

the college was once possessed of in Newcastle" He farther intimates that these had lain so long in disorder and obscurity till the possessions to which they related had been forgotten and lost  under the yearly rent of ten shillings  The parsonage or vicarage house of Newcastle is situated in this street not far from St John's Church  There was a hall in it in Bourne's time very grand and stately

vicaragehouse" which appears to have been almost entirely de∣stroyed by the Scots soon after the taking of the town in This house was repaired and enlarged A D An elegant great room was fitted up in it by the late Dr Brown The Roman wall is said to have passed through the garden of this house    There was a building in this street called SpitalAlmsHouse it stood nearly opposite to St John's

what time this church or chapel was founded  See Bourne's account    Bourne says that it appears to have been built A D  In a charter Ed I "Venellum quo itur ad ecclesiam Sancti Johannis"    Great alterations were probably made both in the steeple and body of the church by Robert Rhodes the great benefactor to all our reli∣gious buildings  His arms which remain in two of the other churches are found here also under the belfryThey are also placed over the window on the outside of the southcross One William Hutton is conjec∣tured to have been one of the first benefactors to this church from some punning devices expressive of his name after the manner of those times which are still preserved in the glass of one of the southeast windows of the southcross and upon one of the pillars before the western gallery  Dr Ellison's MSS"In one of the southeast windows of the southcross there is a coat of arms in the glass but not coloured viz two fuller's clubs I think and in base a tun W H are

accounts from June th and ending June th  In the lower apartments is kept a subscription coffeehouse  Near the head of WestGate behind a handsome new square built by Mr Newton architect stands the house of the Black Friars  BLACK FRIARS  THIS house was filled with Dominicans one of the four orders of mendicants or begging friars  The orders of mendicants were instituted according to the learned Warton on the following occasion"The monastic orders in consequence of their ample revenues had degenerated from their primitive austerity and long before the thirteenth century were totally abandoned to luxury and indolence Hence a new order of religious was intro∣duced who being destitute of fixed possessions and of consequence obliged to rely on their own merits with the people might restore respect to the monastic institution and recover the honour of the church"This order one and the first of the four is said to have been founded by St Dominic a native of Cologna in Spain A D Pope Innocent III approved it in and it was confirmed by a bull of Pope Honorius the Third in By some they are reported to have come into England A D but ac∣cording to others not till the year Their first residence was at OxfordThey boast of having produced a great number of martyrs and confessorsthree popes sixty cardinals an hundred and fifty archbishops and eight hundred bishops and to have fur∣nished in this kingdom no less than eighty writers of eminence  Their habit was a white cassock with a white hood over it and abroad they wore a black cloak and hood over allAt the dissolution they had fortythree houses    In France they are called Jacobins from their house in St James's Street ParisThey are named Black Friars from the colour of their garments Dominicans from the name of their founder Preaching  Most respectfully  of the  An inside  of the  MONASTRY  of  BLACK FRIARS  Friars from their office of preaching and converting hereticsAt New∣castle they appear to have had the title of Shod Friars  The lane near this house called at present LowFriarChare anciently was styled ShodFriarChare from the circumstance of its vicinity to this monastery  Grey who certainly mistakes in saying this was called in old time "The Gray Friars" adds that they were called also "BennetChessieFriars" a corruption some have thought of "Benoists Chaussès"  i e  "Shod Bennets" from their having adopted in a certain measure the rule of St Bennet or Benedict The only real evidence for this supposed title for I do not think they were ever called so occurs in the commoncoun∣cil books of Newcastle June st in the account of a  parcell of ground called BennyChessesClose  in FenkellStreet which was doubtless part of the possessions of this monastery but I cannot help being of opinion that it was so called from the name of the lessee after the dissolutionIn the books of the merchants of Newcastle A D there occurs one "Bennat Chessye" an officer of that respectable body and who was buried as appears by St Nicholas' Register October  in contradis∣tinction as it should seem to their neighbours the Grey Friars who went barefooted Sir Peter Scot and his son Sir Nicholas Scot are said to have invited the order to Newcastle and to have founded this house  This Sir Peter Scot was the first chief magistrate of Newcastle who had the title of mayor A D His son was one of the four bailiffs in the years and and mayor in Neither of them has the title of knight in the list of mayors but Leland and a MS which Bourne often cites "De Reb Novocastr" affix a "Sir" to each of their names According to Leland they were both merchants in Newcastle and owners of the lordship of Eshett in Northumberland "The beginning of these "Scotts" he observes "was by merchandice"    The precise date of the building has not been transmitted  Tanner says it was about the year or shortly after    The ground on which it stands is said to have been given by three pious sisters whose names have been ungratefully consigned to oblivion  November th after an inquisition taken by Adam de Gesse∣muth sheriff of Northumberland and the mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne by which it appeared that the aqueduct made by the Friars Preachers of that town under a royal grant from a certain fountain be∣yond their courtyard and to their monastery and from thence into the town ought to remain as an advantage to the public at large the King confirmed it to them for ever  "Paten' de anno regni Regis Henrici tercii quadragesimo octavo  "Pro fratribus predicatoribus Novi Castri super Tynam Rex

should seem formerly prior occurs at St Andrew's in Scotland very learnedly informing his audience there that Pater noster should be addressed to God and not to the Saints See in a note subjoined from the Preface to Knox's History of the Re∣formation a picture of the manners of our monks drawn from the life and marked with striking traits of the wretched ignorance that prevailed in those times  One Richard Marshall prior of the BlackeFriars at Newcastle in England preach∣ed in St Andrews that the Paternoster should be said to God only and not to the Saints The doctors of St Andrew's attended at it made a GrayFriar called Tottis preach a  inst Marshall his tenet which he did  taking his  out of the th of St Mat∣thew "Blessed are the poor in spirit" Seeing we say good day rather to any old man in the street we may call a Saint Pater who is older than any alive And seeing they are in heaven we may say to any of them our Father which art in heaven And seeing they are holy we may say to any of them hallowed be thy name And since they are in the kingdom of heaven we may say thy kingdom come And seeing their will is God's will we may say to any of them thy will be done But when the GrayFriar preaching came to the fourth petition give us this day our daily bread he was hissed at and so was constrained not only to leave off preaching but also to leave the city for shame Yet among the doctors then assembled the dispute continued about the Pater for some would have it said to God formaliter and to the Saints materialiter Others to God principa∣liter to the Saints minus principaliter others primario to God secundario to the Saint  others would have it said to God taking it strictè and to the Saints taking it late Notwithstanding all their distinctions the doctors could not agree upon the bu∣sinesse A fellow called Tom servant to the subprior of St Andrews one day per∣ceiving his master much troubled with some businesse and as he conceived weighty said to him sir what is the matter of this your trouble The master answered we can∣not agree about the saying of the Pater The fellow replied to whom should it be said but to God alone The master answers what shall we do then with the Saints The fellow replies give them aves and credes enough that may suffice them and too well too" Bourne tells us that he saw a grant of a tenement near the WhiteCross signed by friar

alterations that have taken place in it to give a more than faint idea of what it must originally have been There is a perspective view of the outside of it in Grose's Anti∣quities  This monastery

apartments for their poorBut see afterwards in the ac∣count of "ManorChare"  Bourne complains of the d  rtiness that prevailed in this place in his time I could not on a late visit compliment the present tenants with profiting any thing by his censure of which however it is probable they have never heard Their want of cleanliness is the more to be wondered at as they still enjoy the advantage of abundance of fine water in the old well adjoining to it and still called our Lady's Well which whatever imagi∣nary qualities it may have  to the present hour its purifying virtues  The west window

SheepHead Alley  Before I enter upon the history of the Castle of Newcastle I shall take occasion to give a brief account of the famous wall of the emperor Hadrian which ended at the castrum of the Roman station of Pons Aelii and that of the emperor Severus which passed through the site of the present Newcastle and ended at Wall's End  Hadrian's Wall or Vallum made A D was a wall of turf with a deep foss or ditch accompanying it on the north side the ori∣ginal height of it is not known  Severus' Wall was built A D of square stones and every where also except on the edges of precipices was accompanied by a deep ditch or foss The original height thereof was feet and the breadth Between the village of Walker  i e  the town by the wall and BykerHill the Wall of Severus with its foss are still plainly distinguishable the site of the wall at present is covered with brush∣wood and stunted trees Dr Stukeley has preserved in his Iter Boreale a view of the appearance of the Roman Wall between BykerHill Mill and Newcastle when he wrote From this mill to the Smith's shop near the first milestone on the Shields road the site of the wall and hollow of the foss running parallel with the present turnpike way are yet clearly discernible  At the head of the bank overlooking OuseBurn was a castellum or exploratory tower out of the foundations of which I saw many Roman stones taken not many years ago to build an adjoining house  Coing down the hill from thence to the rivulet of OuseBurn the foss on the north side of the hedge is still very deep and forms what is here called a little gill  Severus' Wall must have formed a small angle at the arch by which it has crossed OuseBurn  On the rise of the hill between this streamlet and RedBarns I found April d many of the square stones which had evidently been the plunder of the wall  About RedBarns the garden grounds have destroyed every vestige both of the wall and the foss but when we are past the gardens the remains of the wall seem again to appear and having crossed the field proceed in a straight line behind the Keelman's Hospital to the SallyPort or ShipCarpenter's Tower There was a ropewalk here upon the foundation of the wall not many years ago  Near the present SallyPort Gate stood a turret or Roman castlellum From hence the wall as the foundations thereof which were discovered some years ago  Thomasin Scott an old woman about years of age living on the WallKnoll informed me April d that several years ago some workmen in building a coachhouse there for Alderman Sowerby discovered plainly the foundations of the Roman Wall coming over the top of the hill and bearing to the north side of the present SallyPort Gate and that a great many curious gentlemen came to view it  The passage of Virgil lib vii may be strictly applied to the etymon of WallKnoll from the Roman Wall  "Ab illo  Dicitur aeternumque tenet per saecula nomen"  plainly evinced passed over the top of the hill to  which it gave the name of WallKnoll and must have crossed PandonBurn by an arch near StockBridge as it is said to have been the ancient boundary and defence of the royal mansion of PandonHall on the north  Grey in his

in∣tersected  the line of the townwall a little to the north of the WestGate where Horseley supposes a very small turn has been made in it in order to come up to the north rampart of the station  Horseley thus determines the boundaries and situation of the station of Pons Aelii "I hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the wall's passing through St George's Porch near the northwest corner of St Nicholas' church But it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church and I think has not touched this porch though it comes near it And therefore I conjecture that the wall which has passed through this porch must have been the east rampart of the station for the supposition will reconcile these seemingly different accounts and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of Severus' Wall so as to pass through that porch and be continued along the brow of the hill at the head of the side till it meet the line of Ha∣drian's Vallum near the cast end of Belygate and not far from the Castle this line seems to answer so well in all respects that I cannot much doubt its having been the eastern limits of the ancient station for this brings the station near to the Castle which probably has been built a little more to the southeast in order to bring it nearer to the top of a steep hill And fixing the eastern boundary of the station here leaves a plain and level area for the station itself and without it a descent towards the south and the river for the town to stand upon which might extend itself to the bridge supposing the ancient bridge to have been near the same place where the present one stands From which bridge the ancient town and station might probably take the name of Pons Aelii This eastern boundary of the station must at that time have been nearer the river than it is now since it is certain that the river formerly flowed farther up towards this part of the town The position of the eastern rampart of the station being thus determined the other boundaries may be also defined for the distance here between the lines of the walls seems to be about charms and it is not much to be questioned but the two walls here as in other cases they frequently did have fallen in with the northern and southern ramparts of the station so that these chains have been the breadth of the station And if we suppose the station to have been of a middle size we must make it a square and allow chains for the length of it If at this distance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former and between the lines of the wall it will be the western boundary of the station as the two respective parts of the two walls make the northern and southern limits And upon this supposition a line drawn from the scot of the Flesh Market to Barly Gate near the east end of it will be the eastern limits of the ancient station That part of the vallum which reaches from BailyGate to Mr Ord's house will be the southern limit and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of Severus' Wall which is about yards east from the end of RosemaryLane must be the western boundary and the part of Severus' Wall included between this and the foot of the FleshMarket remains for the line of the northern rampart" page  at Newcastle and to get to a sufficient distance from Hadrian's Vallum  Horseley with great probability supposes that one of the extremities of Hadrian's Vallum was on the bank of the Tyne beyond the castle perhaps near the present halfmoon battery covered now with mo∣dern buildings where there may have been a circular turret in the time of the Romans to command the pass of the bridge  This vallum passing the north corner of the castle went in a straight line  It crossed WestGate we collect from that writer between the part or con  luit  stood in his time not far from the end of DentonChare and Barly Gate but  to BailyGate and passing near the free school intersected the line of the town well but  WestGate and the smaller gate that leads to the Earth  that  before he wrote a coin of Vespasian was found  he was told by the person that found it I am of opinion that the inscriptions belonging to the state  of Pons  all built up in the old keep of the castle and that  ch  of this  or other be discovered lurking in its almost impregnable walls by future    to the place where in Horseley's time it became distin∣guishable without the WestGate and so onwards to that rising which still is so remarkable in a field without the TurnpikeGate along which are ranged a set of boundary stones where it certainly has passed  Hadrian's Vallum is with extreme probability supposed to have formed the southern rampart of the station of Pons Aelii as Severus' Wall at the distance of about six chains may be naturally thought to have been the northern one This station most likely has been square The brow of the hill at the head of the Side easily directs us where to draw the line of the eastern rampart running from St George's Porch till intercepted by Hadrian's Vallum near BailyGate And a line drawn from what was in Horseley's time Mr Ord's house lately Mr Gibson's the townclerk's to that part of the line of Severus' Wall which was about yards east from the present RosemaryLane shews as what must have been the western boundary of this fortification  From that part of the line of the townwall where we left Severus' work the track of it running westward has entirely been destroyed by buildings and gardens till near the TurnpikeGate where it was thought distinguishable in Horseley's time in a small field between QuarryHouse and Newcastle That writer was of opinion that it  passed through the site of this quarryhouse just beyond which on the west an immense quarry has eradicated every vestige both of the wall and foss of Severus but mounting to the top of the rising ground be∣yond it westward the hollow of the foss begins to reappear running along pretty close to the north side of the turnpike road to Benwall called in the Notitia the Station of Condercum  Hadrian's Vallum which we left running up a field west of the TurnpikeGate and marked by a range of boundary  They are

Normans" says Grose in the preface to his Antiquities p "found the ruins of an ancient building on the site of their intended structure they either en∣deavoured to incorporate it into their work or made use of the materials as may be seen by many buildings of known Norman construction wherein are fragments of Saxon archi∣tecture or large quantities of Roman bricks which has caused them often to be mistaken for Roman or Saxon edifices"  reedifying or refounding of this once very strong and important fortress is differently fixed by different historians some placing it in the year

this castle was only repaired by Robert Curtois son of the Conqueror Boeth p Buchanan vol i p  Many considerations induce us to lament that no one has set about to give us a work to be intitled "The Harmony of English Historians" till that appear we may perhaps do something towards reconciling the various and clashing accounts of the building of this castle by supposing that the earliest relate to the year when it was be∣gun and the others to the time of its final completion  However that may be the greater part of our historians agree that this work was undertaken during the reign and at the command  of William the Conqueror under the direction of Robert Curthose his eldest son on his return from an unsuccessful enterprize against Mal∣colm king of Scotland who presuming on the absence of William on the Continent where he was likely to have been a long while detained by the revolt of the Normans and the diversion of his French enemies had passed the borders of the two kingdoms and wasted the northern provinces of England  Its having been called on its erection the "New Castle" seems strongly to imply that it arose from the site of some older fortress from which by way of contradistinction it derived a name extended after∣wards to the adjoining town and which is still retained in its present appellation  See BourneThe Milbank MS he says tells us "that this New Castle may be dis∣tinguished from the old one"  i e  the Round Tower since called the HalfMoon Bat∣tery which is supposed to have been a Roman fortress to command the pass of the bridge over the river Tyne built by the Emperor Hadrian and which gave its name to the Ro∣man station  i e  Pons Aelii See Account of TyneBridge  Thus as Dr Plot in his History of Staffordshire in∣forms us in a very similar instance Newcastle under Lyme  Leland in his Itinerary vol vii fol says "Newcastell under Line" is "so cawllid of a brooke renning therby or of an hille or wodd therby so cawllid There cummith a broke out of the pole aboute the castell  In Rymer's  rdera tom v A D "Novo Castro subtus Lynam" occurs  The English Monery says it is called Newcastle upon Line from the rivulet Line upon which it is seated to distinguish it from Newcastle upon Tyne in Northumberland In the Rolls of Parliament vol vi p A D there occurs mention of "Newcastell under Lyne otherwise called Newcastell under Lyme within our countie of Stafford"  or Line in that county had its name from the old castle of Chesterton under Lyme which at the time of its erection was falling into ruin  Scarcely had this castle been completed before it was converted to a purpose very different from the intention of building it having been se∣cured to protect the rebellion of Earl Mowbray against William Rufus the son and successor of William the Conqueror The King marched against it in the year  The words of Brompton are "Detecta et cognita eorum fraude Rex cum exercim m  gno Northumbriam adiit ubi citò in quadam firmitate quae Novum Castrum vocatur plures de proceribus se invicem alligatis cepit et eos in custodia posuit pro voto extra Angliam relegandes"Decem Scriptores p  Huntingdon's account is somewhat different "Promovit Rex exercitum in Nort∣humbre statimque in quadam firmitate quae vocatur Novum Castellum omnes meliores consules et proceres cepit"Hon Huntingdon Hist p lib vii  Matthew Paris p says "In Novo Castello potentisumos quosque familiae comitis cepit et vinculis redidit"  The Saxon Chronicle does not contra  he  the above and mentions the taking of a great many of Mowbray's adherent "in a certain fortress"  The Durham MS in the Cotton library has these words "He the King entered Newcastell wherein he took preesoners the best souldiers of the said counte c"  But where is the probability that the best soldiers of this noble delinquent would yield themselves prisoners till a short siege at least ended perhaps by storming the fortress had convinced them of the impossibility of holding it out against the king  with a great army and took it after a  short siege together with several of the partizans of that noble traitor William having missed the great object of his northern journey in this castle sat down before that of Tinmouth on the taking of which also he was a second time disappointed for Earl Mowbray was found to have taken refuge in the fortress of Bambrough After a tedious and fruitless siege of that castle rendered by its natural situation almost im∣pregnable the King returned southward but not till he had erected a castle before it to cut off all hopes of throwing in succours and filled it with his army whom he directed to continue the blockade  Driven perhaps to great straits through want of provisions Mow∣bray closed with an offer of some of his faithful adherents of whose loyalty the King had however entertained no suspicions as he had ap∣pointed them the guards of this Newcastle upon Tyne these had trai∣terously and with secrecy invited the Earl to take shelter in it The unfortunate nobleman escaped from Bambrough but was discovered during his flight to this castle on which he suddenly changed his route and took sanctuary in the church of St Oswin at Tinmouth The holy asylum could not protect so formidable an enemy of the King for after being wounded he was dragged out by violence from the altar and made a prisoner  Thompton's account  "Inde vero quodam also castello conquisito et statre consulis in eo capto apud Bamburgh consulem post haec obsedit quod cum armis inexpugnabile Rex viderit aliud castellum ante illud paravit quod Malveyseyn appellavit in quo partem exercitus sui relinquens recessit Cumque postmodum quadam nocte Robertus Consul a castro de Bamburgh latenter recessisset eum usque Tynmuth regalis exercitus est secutus ubi cum se defendere non posset ad ecclesiam Sancti Oswyni regis martyris fugit in quâ demum vulneratus violenter extrahitur et in Regis custodia securè ponitur"De∣cem Scriptores p  "Robert" says Ridpeth in his Border History p "by means of some secret cor∣respondence he had in the garrison of Newcastle hoped to make himself master of it for this purpose he set out from Bamburgh in the night accompanied by thirty horse But being observed by the garrison of Malvoisin he was pursued by a part of them and his pursuers having advertised the garrison of Newcastle to be upon their guard he found himself shut out from that place and directed his flight to the monastery of St Oswin at Tinmouth"  Odericus Vitalis says that the Earl was betrayed by his own men See

Northumberland the offices of constable and porter of Newcastle sheriff of the county of Northumberland and constable of the castle of Dunstanborough and Bamburgh in that county By the list of sheriffs it appears that the above Earl was appointed first in and continued till  of the wardenship of the north marches together with the castles towns lordships customs and feefarms of Carlisle and

the cor∣poration of Newcastle upon Tyne the supposed private act of parlia∣ment whereby this castle and its precinct had been restored  Perhaps the charter of Hen IV had neither power nor intention to sever it from thence The following is extracted from Grose's Antiquities vol i "The castle of Chester with the precincts thereof were reserved out of that charter by King Henry VII by which that city was made a county of itself and accordingly hath ever since been used for the King's majesty's service of the county of Chester and esteemed a part thereof and not of the county of the city"  Morant in his History of Colchester p tells us "The castle of that town with the bailey is independant of the corporation"The Tower of London is exempted from the city jurisdictionThe castle of Norwich stands in the middle of the city yet is wholly exempted from itThe same may be observed of Worcester Castle which as far as the bounds thereof go is out of the corporation  to the county of Northumberland after the charter of the st of Henry IV had constituted the town of Newcastle a county of itself was in a great degree invalidated and the same power given to the magistrates of Newcastle in this place the dungeon only excepted as in all others under their peculiar jurisdiction  "Elizabeth Dei gratia cCumque quoddam vetus et ruinosum castrum scituat' existit infra predictam

and defence of clients causes The place where moot cases were argued was anciently called a moothall"Blount's Law Dictionary in verbo  I am not satisfied with this etymology for the MootHall in the castle of Newcastle See before a note under where "mota" is used in the original record for the castle itselfMay not therefore moothall mean no more than "the hall of the castle" See Blount also for this sense of the word "mota"  and other conveniences for keeping the assizes and sessions for the use of the county of Northumberland were excepted in this grant at the time of the date of which the

from it also that the grant of King James to Stevenson fell into the possession of Barbara Blacke widow of Patrick Blacke from whom about November th it was conveyed Jane Langston of St Martin's in

inquisition was taken concerning the bounds  of this castle and the lands thereto belonging and there was an in∣formation thereupon in the exchequer chamber  It appeared says Bourne by this inquisition that the ancient castle belonging to the King situated within the walls of Newcastle upon Tyne belongs to the county of North∣umberland and is surrounded with a great stonewallthat below the castle there is a great hall where the county of Northumberland hold their assizesThere is also a great tower full of chinks under which are two vaults which are the places where the pri∣soners of the said county of Northumberland are kept which are within the circuit of the castle itselfAnd that there is in being the exterior wall of the castle He goes on to describe the boundaries of it which from the change of owners of the different tene∣ments c surrounding it is unintelligible at this distance of time which contains by measure acres of ground and one rood  Complaint was made of an enormous dunghill in length yards and in breadth and yards deep which imposed so prodigious a weight upon the wall on the west side of the castle in length yards yards in height and two yards broad as to have thrown down a great part thereof to the great detriment of the strength of the castle the damage of which was computed at l  It was also complained of that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies and that onethird of it was almost taken away that all the lead and covering which it had of old was embezzled and carried off insomuch that the prisoners of the county of Northumberland were most miserably lodged by reason of the showers of rain falling upon themThey computed that the charge of repairing it would amount to l s He adds in a note that the above enormous dunghill was taken away by Sir John Mar∣ley mayor and his adherents to rampart the town's walls against the parliament and commonwealth    In the year Sir John Marley Knt then mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne covered the keep of this castle with planks  Books of the company of shipwrights in Newcastle"At a meeting August st to treat concerning the right worshipful the mayor his propositions concerning covering the castle with plank c"  and placed cannon thereupon for defence of the town against the Scots he retired to it with some others after the enemy had taken Newcastle by storm October th and held it out against them for eight days with great gallantry  Bourne p "In the year the roundtower under the MootHall towards the Sand Hill called the HalfMoon which was the old castle of Monkchester was by Sir John Marley made use of to secure the river and keyside against the Scots and the other castle he put into good repair which was very ruinous on the former he had great guns for the use abovementioned and on the latter he placed great ordnance to beat off those guns which the Scots had laid upon the banks of Gateshead against the town"    An information occurs in the House of

King was petitioned to grant this castle and its precincts the lease whereof to Stevenson was within a few years of expiring for the use of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne  Upon this a dispute arose whether a grant thereof were not more proper for the county of Northumberland than for the town because it was alleged though the said castle and garth stand in Newcastle yet they belong to the county of Northumberland  Lord Ogle on behalf of that county having had a conference with those who appeared for Newcastle was convinced that it was more proper for the town of Newcastle to have them on being assured that the gaol c should still continue for the service of the county as heretofore  In the interim of this dispute Lord Gerard prevented the corpo∣ration of Newcastle and obtained a grant

castle but that was found no ways necessary for his majesty's service    In the year we find the mayor aldermen and burgesses of Newcastle petitioning the King to revoke Lord Gerard's grant as it was only under the exchequer seal was at an under value and had been obtained by surprise The matter was referred to the lords commissioners of the treasury but they could obtain no redress for the present  From the petition a copy still preserved in the archives of the corporation    The matter of annexing the CastleGarth to Newcastle and dismem∣bering it from the county having been referred by the lords commis∣sioners of the treasury to the attorneygeneral it was by him reported that he conceived it might be more fit for the government of the inha∣bitants of CastleGarth if that place was put within the limits and jurisdiction of the town of Newcastle which might be done by the King's letters patent with a proviso that the assizes and sessions be kept there for the county as formerly

purporting that King's Meadows an island in the middle of the river Tyne opposite to Elswick belonged to this castle as also that several streets in Newcastle belonged to it    The liberties and privileges of the castle extend northwards to the river of Tweed and southward to the river of Tees  Bourne p For an account of the several villages c see Wallis' History of Northumberland vol iiHutchinson's Northumberland c  "  The subsequent observations on the present remains of this once famous and important fortress were made July th  The Keep or Great Tower measured yards and a quarter in height it appears anciently to have been somewhat higher and had no doubt a kernelled battlement  The ichnography of this keep would describe nearly a square the lines of two sides of which bear to the northwest That front how∣ever which properly speaking ought to be called the southwest front is generally styled the south one The others are named the west north and east sides with the same little impropriety  The grand entrance originally no doubt the only one is at a great height from the ground  Mr King in his ingenious Essay on ancient Castles Archaeologia vol iv speaking of Canterbury castle says p "Whoever looks at that ancient structure attentively will easily perceive that the present entrances have been forced and could never have been there originally"  Two portals as it were must be passed before we can arrive at it  "The entrance was not in any ancient castle that I have seen in the lower story or upon the ground or near it but at a considerable height and was by means of a grand staircasethere was also a strong gate about the middle of the staircase"Ibid p  From the first of these which is on the south and in a great wall  "There were two great strong walls" says Bourne "which surrounded the castle The interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself as may be still seen in several places The exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle bounders From this outer wall were four gates the great gate and three posterns On the north side of the castle is the main gate now called the BlackGate It has had two portcullises one without the gate as may be still seen and another within it at a little distance from it the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago On the east side of the castle there was a postern which led down to the street called the Side which is still to be seenOn the south side of the castle is another gate which leads down the castle stairs to the street called the Close This was called the SouthPostern There is an old building upon it which was the countygaoler's house On the westside was the postern facing BailiffGateThere is an house in the yard  i e  CastleGarth or Yard where they say was the chapel of the garrison which is called the ChapelHouse to this day it stands northeast from the chapel he means the chapel of the castle or keep its common name now is the Three Bulls Heads"  i e  an Inn with that sign  Since Bourne's time in digging cellars for this inn human bones as also a large stone coffin were found  Dr Stukeley who visited this castle in seems to have mistaken a part of its outerwall for what he calls "a bit of the true old Roman Wall" See Iter Boreale p et seq  There is a place still called the Mount on the south side of this keep and within the outer wall of the fortification  "Large mounts" says Grose ut supra p "were also often thrown up in this place these served like modern cavaliers to command the adjacent country"  which at a few yards distance has in∣closed  the whole keep we mount by eleven steps to the second one which is of prodigious strength and from the top of it the be∣sieged appear to have had great power to annoy the assailants  From this second portal to the grand entrance are eighteen steps part leading from south to north and part from east to west No grooves for portcullises  "The Herse or Portcullis was a strong grating of timber fenced with iron made to slide up and down in a groove of solid stonework within the arch of the portal just as a sashwindow does in its frame and its bottom was furnished with sharp iron spikes designed both to strike into the ground or floor for the sake of greater firmness and so∣lidity and also to destroy and break whatever should be under it at the time of its being let fall and its groove was always contrived to deep in the stonework that it could not be injured or removed without pulling down the whole wall"King ut supra p  are discoverable in either of the portals but so much appears to have been demolished that one cannot from thence infer that there have never been any  The grand entrance which is towards the east has had its arch adorned in a superb manner with zigzag and other Saxon or semiSaxon ornaments  The wall here measured four yards and a quarter in thickness  Pennant in his Tour in Scotland vol m p speaking of the place tells us "The walls of Roberts Tower are thirteen feet thick with galleries ga  ed out of them" He adds "The height of this tower was eightytwo feet the square on the outside sixtytwo by fifty four"    Near this grand entrance and in front as you ascend to it from south to north is a doorway leading into a little apartment which has been richly adorned on the insideIt stands over a crypt or vault of consi∣derable height on two great arches that intersect each other of beauti∣ful  Gothic masonryThis had a distinct roof and the whole forms a projection eastward at the northeast angle against the east end of which a modern house has been built From the garret of this house there is at present an entrance into it through an arched passage where there must have been anciently a window At present it is a currier's shop From the richness of its interior ornaments I suspected it to have been the chapel to which supposition its direction from east to west is not unfavourable It must however have been but a very small one Bourne supposes the chapel to have been within the walls of this keep on the ground floor in a place which at present composes a part of Mr Fife's very curious and extensive cellar  The great entrance seems to have led immediately into the state apartments  "The room" says Bourne "this grand entrance leads into has its floor broken down close to the castlewall as indeed all the other floors are to the top of the castles so that excepting the floor above the countygaol there is not one left though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this This floored room flagged by William Ellison Esq mayor of Newcastle in seems to me without any doubt to have been the common hall of the castlebecause on the north side of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into one where is the largest fireplace I saw in the castle which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen"Near this kitchen Bourne supposed he could also trace the pantry and cellar"On the south of this room" says Bourne also "there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawingroom which has a fireplace in it which has been a piece of curious workman∣ship as is visible to this day And this place has no communication with any part of the castle but this room"  which have been lighted from the east by the most mag∣nificent window in the whole great tower Near this and in the body of the wall is an apartment with a curious drawwell in itat sixteen yards depth  The water was two yards lower in Bourne's time  we reached the water The depth in all is thirtyone yards and a quarter The water is hard and very cold There are square cavities in the wall on each side of this well in which are round holes for pipes used anciently to convey the water to the several apart∣ments It measures eleven yards to the ground from the window of the apartment that contains the well  There is no way at present to the top of this keep where one is sur∣prised  to find a little artificial garden producing appletrees rosebushes c except by one great winding staircase about two yards wide in the northeast angle There is another staircase  Thus King ut supra p speaking of Canterbury castle he tells us "There are two circular staircases in the corners"  in the southeast angle but it is now built up at the top It has come down to the ground floor at which place also the communication is now closed up  By the rows of square holes in which the beams have rested there must have been five stories of apartments of which the great hall and state rooms were the lowest from the present flagged floor to the top of this tower  There is a gallery of communication in the center or thickness of the wall and on all four sides of it about five yards and a half  Thus King ut supra p "Within the thickness of the walla gallerythat orders might be speedily communicated to all partsAnd there was besides another smaller and narrower gallery within the thichness of the wall in the floor above"  Speaking also of Guildford castle he says "There are also galleries in the thickness of the wall as at Rochester"  from the top This passage is about two yards and a half high and has three or four loup holes on each side all widening gradually inwards  Below this in the south front is a gallery in the center of the wall about fifteen yards and three quarters from the ground in which there have been two large ornamented windowsnearly on a level with which on the north front is another window of the like sort  Two great windows have let in light to the great hall  "These great rooms" says King ut supra p "were undoubtedly hung with arras"  of this keep that in the south front near the southwest angle having had the pillar or division in it broken away has now the appearance of a doorway A door hardly half its size is at present hung in it The other window is very observable it is on the west side near the southwest angle  The kitchen of this great tower has been in the north wall it con∣tains a much larger fireplace than any other of the apartments The chimney appears on the outside of the wall by a square projection  ending abruptly and yet I know not with any degree of certainty whether ever it has been carried up any higher one of its windows has been enlarged with great labour to give more light to a joiner's shop into which it has been converted  The northwest angle of this tower is of an hexagonal form  "Neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers square round and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the same building" Grose ut supra p  and projects in a manner different from any of the others  Thus King ut supra p "The outlets to the sinks and other conveyances of filth were nearly in the same manner as the chimneys only reversed and going down∣wards"  In the wall of the western front have been several necessaryhouses communicat∣ing with the great drains  All the apartments of the groundfloor and the countyprison itself except when used at the assizes have been converted into cellars a pur∣pose for which their great coolness renders them very fitThere is a place here into which if water be poured in the largest quantities it im∣mediately disappearsIt probably communicates with one of the large drains  In the center of the present county prison is a remarkable pillar from which arches branch out very beautifully on all sides This co∣lumn is hollow and a pipe has  "Having a hollow in the middle" says Bourne "of a foot wide with a lead spout in the side of it"  conducted water down through it from the well beforementioned There is a very observable window  "Windows" says he "were so contrived that it was almost impossible for any wea∣pon to be shot into the room so as to do any hurt for if it went at all ascending it would strike against a low arch purposely contrived over every window and could not enter the room at all" King ut supra p  I know not which is the house which Bourne says was anciently the countygaol and underneath which he adds "It is reported there is a vault which leads to the castle" "There is indeed a large door" he continues "still to be seen which was perhaps the entrance into it and Mr George Grey the present possessor told me that it was cer∣tainly so because he had put down through his own sloot a bailiff's rod to the very end and could find no bottom"  I know not on what authority Bourne rests his information when he tells us that the castlegate I suppose he means the BlackGate was begun to be built by one George Hayroy but was finished by one John Pickle who kept a tavern in it  in  this place with an arch turned in the inside to repel missile weapons c See an account of many similar ones in King's ingenious ac∣count of ancient castles ut supra  Great alterations must have been made in the appearance of the low parts of the south front when the temporary prison of the county was made in this keep The present entrance to which we descend by four or five steps must have been first made on that occasion for there is no arch over it in the wall Another similar kind of entrance on the eastern side of the southeast angle which is now built up with a swinestye before it is also without doubt of a date much posterior to that of the original building  If there has been a dungeon in this keep as there probably was I mean that dreary kind of mansion to which the only entrance was by a square hole in the top it must have been filled up as no traces thereof can be discovered at present  NEWGATESTREET  NEWGATESTREET has plainly had its name from the NewGate which bounds it on the north  Bourne mentions a tenement on the east side of this street given by Mrs Alice Belaysis to UniversityCollege in Oxford  On the east side of this street near the NewGate is a tenement which was given by Mrs Alice Belaysis to UniversityCollege in Oxford A D The site of it is thus described "Situatum est infra predictam villam juxta novam portam ejusdem ville inquo quidem tenemento Thomas Gray Lidster modo inhabitat viz inter tenementum Roberti Daunt ex parte boreali et vicum ducentem ad fratres minores ab ecclesia Sancti Andree ex parte australi" But the same writing goes farther"Ac tria tenementa et duo tofta inde insimul situantur in eodem vico ducente a dicta ecclesia Sancti Andree usque fratres predictos" c Bourne p    The same writer tells us that a tradition remained in his time that  there had been anciently several markets between NewGate and the WhiteCross  In an inrolment in the archives of Newcastle upon Tyne dated Car II "the NoltMarket" occurs as "neare the WhiteCrosse"Ibid May d "the great inns in the NoltMarket" occur  A mutilated deed preserved in St Andrew's vestry mentions a messuage in this street called "HorseMarketGate" inter terram abbatis de novo monasterio c" dated  In the Harleian MSS Eschaets Ric II a messuage occurs in "HorseMar∣ketGate"  There are four fairs kept in this street in the year one at Lammas and another at St Lukesmass both for horsesThe other two are for black cattle the one on All Souls Day and the other at MartinmasBourne    An ancient street called DarneCrook runs westward to the townwall at the bottom of St Andrew's churchyard In this says Bourne were some wastes and houses that belonged to the nuns of St Bartholomew  Almost contiguous to NewGate stands St Andrew's church  ST ANDREW'S CHURCH  THIS building appears to have retained more of its original masonry than the other churches and from the style of its architecture has been generally thought to be the oldest in the town  See Bourne's account David King of Scots it is unknown for what reason is men∣tioned in the MS de Rebus Novo Castr' which he often cites as its founder  The arch that separates the chancel from the body of the church is of the semi Saxon style with zigzag ornaments which proves it to have been built not long after the con∣quest  In the columns that support this arch there are proofs hewn out in stone that some of the Romish exhibitions in churches were comparatively speaking no more than inno∣vations These plainly appear to have been cut away in parallel directions to gain sup∣ports for the rood loft which stood under this arch before the ReformationFor an ac∣count of rood lofts see Staveley on Churches p    Mention of it occurs A D in the time of King Henry III  Chartulary of Tinmouth monastery at NorthumberlandhouseAnno R R II fil' Johannis tio "Item de terr' Gilberti Marishall d unde paroch' Sancti Andree respond"    Bourne is of opinion that it was founded by the townsmen and reli∣gious houses  A D the justices itinerant appear to have held their courts in this church  Tinmouth MS ut supra fol "Quod quidem breve Dominis G et M justic' in ecclesia Sancti Andree Novi Castri fuerat ex parte Domini Regis per predictum prio∣rem traditum c anno R R E octavo"    The oldest writing that I have seen belonging to this church is dated  It begins "Anno ab incarnacione Domini M  o  C  o  C  o  octogesimo primo c"    John Bishop of Durham granted an indulgence of forty days to those who should contribute any thing to the reparation of St Andrew's Church in Newcastle and to the chapel of the Holy Trinity in the same c dated at Gateshead July th  See afterwards

still remains having been used not very many years ago as an alecellar to an adjoining alehouse It appears from an old parish book that it was once the habitation of the beadleThe vestry perhaps has been the third chantryIt is very ancientThe roof is formed by ribbed arches and covered with large square stones  No mention occurs of it in the certificate abovecited of the Hen VIII in the

the same time was beau∣tified  in the year A new service of silverplate was subscribed for and procured with a beautiful altarcloth on the occasion  THE STEEPLE  THIS steeple has probably had the name and arms of Robert Rodes in the center under the belfry as in the other churches of the town  By a view from the present bellloft it is discoverable that the belfry has been an∣ciently supported by intersecting arches as well as those of the other three churches of the town These arches were probably destroyed at that timeThree great windows appear to have been built upAgainst the east end of this steeple on the outside there is the same mark of a sloping roof that is often seen in the remains of churches that have belonged to religious housesSee Grose's View of BrinkburnAbbey c    It appears to have been battered down by the cannon of the Scots army during the memorable siege of the town in  Commoncouncil books    It contains six bells of a soft melodious sound  PARISH REGISTER  THE register of this church begins about Some few leaves of a prior date appear to have been lostBourne very unjustly complains that this register has been badly kept  The following entry occurs in St Andrew's register "December th Hugh Brown bured the day in the church the King's kouchman"  i e  coachman  This seems to prove what tradition informs us that the unfortunate monarch during his stay at Newcastle resided in the house in this parish which belonged to the late Sir Walter Blackett Bart  The following entry occurs ibid "March th Thomas Smith and Kattren Lawson asked market dayes in the

parts of the parish  See Bourne's account    It seems rather to have belonged to the lazar house that once stood near it and was an appendage to St Magdalen's Hospital  A D Edward Burell then master of St Magdalen's Hospital is styled also "Pre∣visour of the chapell of St Jaymes and of the Lazer House neighe adjoining to the said hospitall" See account of that hospital  Mention of this place occurs in the account of the wards of the town as follows  "From Gallowsgate unto the WaterMill beside St James' kirk"  In the will of John Cragg of Newcastle upon Tyne dated Tuesday after the feast of the Nativity of St John Baptist he bequeaths five marks to the chaplain that went to St James'"cuidam capellano c  cuidam hujusmodi eunti apud S Jacobum quinque marcas"  See Bourne sub anno    The western end of this chapel has been converted into a cowhouse in the east end is at present a dwellinghouse the fireplace of which stands on the site of the communion table Old arches built up with brick are still observable and the eastern window may be traced  out from the stairs of an adjoining house The whole building is called at present "The SickMan's House"  ST MARY'S CHAPEL AT JESMONT IN THIS PARISH  Randall's MSS say "St Mary's Chapel and Hospital of Gesmond Jesumonde or Jesumuth was a free chapel distant northeast from Newcastle two miles The name is spelled many different ways Jes'mont  i e  the Mount of Jesus noted for its chapel and hospital" There is said to have been an artificial mount at or near this village on which a cross or some image of Christ stood from whence the place is thought to have derived its name Sed Quaere    THE founder of this free chapel at Jesmont dedicated to St Mary is unknown  June th Thomas Hatfield Bishop of Durham instituted Sir William de Heighington chaplain to the free chapel of Jesmuth within the parish of Newcastle on the presentation of Sir Alexander de Hilton and Matilda his wife patrons  See Bourne's accountIt appertained to the barony of Robert de Gaugy in the d of Hen III Adam de Athol who lies buried in the chapel of the Holy Trinity in St An∣drew's church lived in this village and is styled "Dominus de Jesmond" It was

and King James of sacred memory March th" He adds "On the place where the cross stood was a cistern for receiving the water which was then called the New Water This" he continues "was lately pulled down and there is now in the place where the cross was a pillar of stonework"  There is an order of commoncouncil April th in which mention occurs of the White Cross as almost quite demolished and fallen down with directions to the then town's surveyor to rebuild it with steps and other conveniencies  A D a milkmarket was established at WhiteCrossNewcastle Courant Sept In the year it was pulled down and rebuilt after a design by Mr David Stevenson architect    NewgateStreet from the Scotch Inn  It stood directly opposite to the inn called the Turk's Head Bourne describes it as an "ancient building with a large gate which has formerly been a piece of stately work∣manship" He adds that "Sir Robert Shaftoe recorder of this towne in a MS de Rebus Novocasti' was of opinion that this was the house of the earls of Northumberland and was called the Earl's Inn"Sir Robert was however certainly mistakenSee before in the account of the Close  a place where anciently the kings nobility c of

In Corbridge's Plan of Newcastle the foot of BiggMarket is called "The ButterMarkett"  Bigg is the old name for a particular kind of barley    NUNNERY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE  A LITTLE above the Scotch Inn on the opposite side of the street there still remains part of the arch of the great entrance to the Nunnery of St Bartholomew  The account of this evidently the oldest of the monastic buildings here of which any vestiges are now to be found cannot be impro∣perly prefaced with a short history of the first introduction of Christi∣anity into this part of the island  Bede the father of our church history who was born in this north∣ern extremity of England fixes this great event to A D  See Smith's Bede lib ii cap    The place now called Newcastle upon Tyne he mentions years afterwards as the scene of occurrences instrumental in no common degree to the general propagation of our religion throughout the whole island by the name of "Ad Murum  See under "Annals and Historical Events" the proofs that "Ad Murum" was neither "WallTown""Walbottle" nor "Benwall" but stood upon part at least of the site of the present Newcastle upon Tyne  "  i e  At Wall as the re∣sidence of the then Christian King of Northumberland and where two other royal converts became such by the initiatory rite of baptism  A D Peada  "A D His temporibusPeada Merciorum Regis filius venit ad Regem Nor∣danhymbrorum Osvin postulans filiam ejus Alchfledam sibi conjugem dari neque aliter quod petebat impetrare potuit nisi fidem Christi et baptisma cum gente cui praeerat ac∣ciperetBaptizatus est ergo a Finano Episcopo cum omnibus qui secum venerant co∣mitibus ac militibus corumque famulis universis in vico Regis illustri qui vocatur Ad Murum" Smith's Bede p  son of Penda King of Mercia being here on  a visit at the court of Oswy King of Northumberland to demand his daughter Alchfleda in marriage could on no other conditions obtain her father's consent but by being baptized himself and promising that all his subjects should become Christians Struck with the excellence of the doctrines of this new faith which were warmly recommended to him on the occasion by his friend Alchfrid the natural son of Oswy who had married Cyniburga his sister he declared himself a convert by conviction and having been baptized together with his retinue by Finan Bishop of Lindisfarn obtained a bride with whom he may be said to have received a truly royal dower and who would doubtless encourage him in the promulgation of the Christian faith throughout his extensive dominions There accompanied him on this mission of conversion from the court of the Northumberland King four priests Cedda Adda brother of Uttanus abbot of Gateshead Betti and Dinmi to teach and baptize his Mercian subjects on their return home  About  A D Eo temporeSigebert Rex orientalium Saxonum baptizatus est cum suis a Finano in villa regia cujus supra meminimus quae cognominatur Ad Murum ubi tunc temporis erat Rex supradictus Oswin"Smith's Bede p  the same time the zealous Oswy as well by argument as friendly persuasion recovered to the faith of Christ Sigebert King of the East Angles who had apostatized after a former conversion and who after having been baptized together with his attendants by the bishop aforesaid was accompanied home by two priests whom Oswy at his own request deputed to preach the gospel to the East Saxons  "Thus were the East Angles recovered to our faith whose kingdom bounded on the east and north by the sea on the west by St Edmund's Dyke and part of Hertfordshire and on the south by Essex containing the present counties of Norfolk Suffolk Cam∣bridgeshire and the isle of ElyOn his return to his own kingdom he caused proper places of instruction to be erected and the new taught religion began greatly to flourish in the kingdom"  Strutt's Chronicle vol i p    As no account of any building appropriated to baptism or any other rite of Christian worship which in that age appear to have been of the rudest and most simple architecture is given in the relation of the above very important events we may suppose the ceremony to have been performed in the river Tyne if some temporary structure inclosing a baptistery had not previously been provided as had before been done at York where King Aidun was baptized on EasterDay A D in a church of wood which he himself had hastily erected for the occasion  To the ancient name of our town "Ad Murum" succeeded the ap∣pellation of MonkChester it is uncertain at what period this new title took place which has generally been interpreted "The fortified resi∣dence of persons of the monastic order  "Sir Robert Shastoe a former recorder of Newcastle was of opinion that MonkChester had its name from the neighbouring monks' retiring to it for occasional protection in times of danger and devastation" Dr Ellison's MS Notes  " who may have crowded into it for reasons impossible to be known at this very distant period of time  On the introduction of monastic orders with whom not only the reliques of saints but also the scenes of events of great consequence to religion were held in the highest estimation it seems no very impro∣bable conjecture that a place consecrated to the warm imaginations of these wellmeaning zealots by circumstances so remarkable as have been just related should be accounted sacred in more than a common degree if we farther unite the idea of personal safety expected in what had been so recently a Roman fortification and so often wanted in the times of the Danish invasions with that of sanctity affixed to it by something not unlike superstition it seems natural to suppose that those ancient devotees would prefer it on both accounts However this may have been we are certain from the clearest testimony of historians that monks in more than ordinary numbers resided at it and learn farther that neither the idea of local sanctity with which we have pre∣sumed its then inhabitants to have been impressed nor the military  works left in it by former owners could preserve it from destruction in the predatory incursions of foreign or neighbouring barbarians  Matthew of Westminster informs us that in the year of grace an army of Danish pagans ravaged and spoiled the church of Tinmouth carrying off the spoil in∣stantly to their shipsThat sixtyseven years afterwards the same cruel victors d  popu∣lated the whole province of Northumberland to the mouth of the river Tyne and subju∣gated the whole countryAs also that three years afterwards the noble monasteries on our coast those of Lindisfarn Tynmouth Gyrway Jarrow and Weremouth were ut∣terly plundered and destroyed    The monasteries of MonkChester having fallen almost with every memorial of them in the common destruction of sacred edifices by the infidel Danes the ruins of that place seem to have been unnoticed till about the middle of the eleventh century when they were visited on motives of religious zeal similar to those by which we have supposed the Town had before been rendered famous but when scarce any vestiges of the habitations or religious houses of its former monastic orders could be found Aldwine  Hoveden's Annal p  Brompton inter decem Scriptores p  Warton's Anglia Sacra vol i p  monk and prior of the monastery of Winchelsea having gathered from ancient monuments which he ap∣pears to have studied both from motives of christian piety and literary curiosity that Northumberland had been particularly distinguished for its sacred edifices formed a resolution of visiting their remains He was accompanied in what was then a perilous journey by Elfwius and Rein∣fridus two monks of Evesham The holy travellers performed it on foot in all the plainness of pristine simplicity leading a little ass car∣rying some books and sacred vestments necessary for the performance of divine service This happened A D On their arrival at Northumberland their residence was for some time at MonkChester but finding there no vestige of the former monastic orders and having been invited by Walcher then Bishop of Durham to place themselves under the jurisdiction of the church rather than accept an habitation under the power of secular persons they removed from thence a little way down the river to Jarrow which before that time had been a famous monastery and though then in ruins also was fitted up a  second time for the reception of these devout strangers Thus was a revival given to monkery in this part of the island after it had been extinguished and unknown here for about two hundred years that is from the time when the Danes had destroyed the convents  Ridpath's Border History p    Mention occurs of a small Benedictine nunnery at Newcastle upon Tyne A D  "Anno quo anno Clito Eadgarus Etheling frater Sanctae Margaretae cum ducentis militibus mare transiens Apuliam adiitreperi autem sic scriptum quod Agatha mater Sanctae Margaretae et Christina foror ejus apud Novum Castrum super Tyne sponsae Christi consecratae sunt" J Forduni Scoti Chron lib v p  See also Leland's Collectanea vol i p who says it was of the Benedictine order This order or rule was common to monks and nuns the latter of whom omitting only what was improper for their sex wore habits of like colour with the former and had their heads always covered with a veil  Hither Agas the mother of Margaret Queen of Scotland and Christian her sister after King Malcolm was killed at Alnwick retired and took the sacred veil  If we may credit a manuscript in the Bodleian library  See Bernard's Catalogue of MSS preserved in that most venerable repositoryp "Collectiones quaedam de Berwico et Novo Castro""Notandum quod Baron de Hilton miles olim strenuissimus per generaciones et successiones heredum legitimorum ap∣pellatus est fundator illius monasterii monialium in Novo Castro super Tynam" This MS is without date It refutes Speed's account of the founder of this house and if it does not confirm must be admitted not to contradict that of Fordun abovementioned "The family of the Hiltons" says Carter in his Analysis of Honor p "whose anti∣quity not only by an ancient pedigree which I have seen taken out of the office but by the records of the Tower doth produce the noblest descent that I know any family in England"  at Oxford this nunnery owed its origin to an ancient baron of the name of Hilton This family was of distinction in the north in times of the most re∣mote antiquity It has lately become extinct and experienced at last the fate of all human greatness  Speed on I know not what authority ascribes to King Henry the First the foundation of the Hospital of St Bartholomew the Apostle for nuns at Newcastle upon Tyne  See his Catalogue of Religious Houses    David  On the express testimony of Boethius Fordun and other Scottish historians this David King of Scotland during his residence at Newcastle founded there a monastery of Praemonstratensians Admitting the fact no accounts either by tradition or writing have been transmitted where their house stood in Newcastle or with what lands or pos∣sessions it was endowed  King of Scotland who resided at this town soon after A D is reported by some historians to have been the founder of this nunnery  "Moniales apud Novum Castrum fundatae per Sanctum David Regem Scotorum" Appendix ad Joh de Fordun Scoti Chronicon p Hearne's edit vol vSee also ibid lib v cap citing this authority "Ut patet in prologo ejus super statutis bur∣gorum"  It appears by a charter of King John that the Scot∣tish King endowed it with some land  In a charter of the d of King John to the town of Newcastle mention occurs of a claim from that town of fiftyone shillings and a halfpenny from the land which the nuns of that place held at that time by the gift of King David See under "History of Newcastle as a corporate town"    King Henry I may have done the same and for one common reason both these royal benefactors may have been reputed the original founders  Some time before A D William de St Barbara  "Willielmus Dei gracia Dunelmensis Episcopus priori et conventui Sancti Cuthberti et archidiaconis et omnibus sancte matris ecclesie

differences occur concerning the right of creating an abbess or prioress in the nunnery of this house A prioress it seems had been elected to it by the abbot of Newminster which Wolsey then Bishop of Durham as the ordinary thought an infringement of his power  Lord Dacre warden of the marches had interested himself in fa∣vour of the prioress and the claim of the abbot but numerous prece∣dents found in the bishop's registers fully established the justice of the episcopal pretensions  The personal worth of the lady then not quite thirty years of age conciliated favour on this occasion and she was reinstated by a new and proper election the vicargeneral advising her friends to procure a dispensation for her nonage and promising in consideration of the poverty of the house a mitigation

of this nunnery is now unknown  Two great houses are marked out hereabouts in Speed's Plan of Newcastle one is called "King's Lodgings"the other "The Manor" a part of the Nuns I should think it stood near the spot where a playhouse has since been erected Indeed the playhouse seems supported by part of the northwall of St Bartholomew's church in which the north doorway built up with stone is still observable so that where once these daughters of celibacy and retirement heard their masses Thalia and Melpomene now laugh and weep by turns and farces of another kind have succeeded to the super∣stitious rites of papal Rome  The above playhouse erected by Mr William Parker master of the Turk's Head Inn was finished in the latter end of the year  On a view of the Nuns in I discovered that part of the meadow which Bourne tells us was filled up to make the ground levelpart seems to have been left in its original state in order to preserve a very fine wellthis has occasioned a remarkable artificial hol∣low I found also the issues of the two great conduits where Lamborn and Lorkburn unite in the deenOne of them points up towards FickettTower where it passes through the townwall and the other towards ExecutionDock  Bourne as I  think erroneously supposes that the passage still called NunGate was not the grand entrance to it Here very lately remained part of a great arch that once formed a gateway very unlike that of a back passage especially when we consider the general poverty of style in building that prevailed at the time when this was erected  The popular tradition of a subterraneous communication with a neighbouring monastery prevailed here also  See Grose's account of Godstow nunnery in Oxfordshire there is a similar tradi∣tion of a subterraneous passage under the Thames from Syon nunnery to the friary of Sheen now called Richmond in Surry  this was said to have been made for purposes that we shall but hint at and to have ended at the house of BlackFriars Some large vaulted drain has probably given rise to the charge against our fair and as it should seem by this account frail sisterhood and it has owed its support to the illnature of religious party than which no species of rancour has been found to be more malignant  Among Fairfax's Views published in the time of the civil wars and now extremely rare there occurs a small one of the then remains of this nunnery inscribed at bottom the "Nunns Newcastle  I have caused a fac simile of this to be engraved See Plate of Miscellaneous Anti∣quities N  o    "  Nearly at the end of the

William Penrith the site of which is now lost paid an annual rent to the chantry of our Lady in the parishchurch of LongBenton  Also in the inquisition Sept d Elizabeth    Horseley in his Romana

books August th the WoolMarket is mentioned as having been removed "from the PullenMarkett to the lane betwixt GroateMarkett and MiddleStreet adjacent to Mr Lewin's house there"  Near the WoolMarket and opposite the shop of W Charnley bookseller a house stood in my remembrance on the top of which a reservoir was built for the water that came from GatesheadFellIt has lately been taken down and rebuilt    The continuation of this street beyond the east end of DentonChare was the ancient IronMarket  In the book of inrolments in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle in a deed dated th

capacious and superb structure dedicated to St Ni∣cholas  St Nicholas was Bishop of Myra a city in Lycia a province of Asia Minor he lived about the beginning of the fourth century and during the persecution of Licinius the Roman Emperor was sent into banishment but after the death of that tyrant he re∣visited his diocese and threw out all the idols which he found in it He is said to have assisted at the general council of Nice where he strenuously opposed the Arians He commemorated on the sixth of December  Bourne says that in his time a large flag which was the first step into the church at the north door was cut all along the surface with uneven lines in imitation of the waves of the sea as a silent remembrancer of this Saint so famous among some for his miracles and apparitions by sea that he has merited the title of the Patron of the Sailors  There is a perspective view of "St Nicholas' church in Newcastle upon Tyne" in∣scribed to Lord Crew Bishop of Durham W Horseley del  is styled in the earliest accounts of it "The church of New∣castle upon Tyne  See afterwards under Henry I  Yet perhaps it was so called by way of eminence for we find that although in the ordering of the vicarage by Hugh Pudsey Bishop of Durham A D it is called "the church of St Nicholas of Newcastle upon Tyne" yet afterwards in the year it is simply styled "the church of Newcastle" when that of St Andrew appears to have been built by unquestionable evidence  However that may have been it was certainly the mother or parishchurch to which the other three were no more than parochial chapels built it is probable at different pe∣riods as the town was enlarged or became more populous  The respective limits of the four parishes or parochial districts in Newcastle upon Tyne are said to have been settled in the year if we may credit an account in Warburton's MS collections remaining in the archives of the Duke of Northum∣berland  " a circumstance which seems to prove

Laurence of Durham who was prior of Durham in the year which by the way is a farther proof of our conjecture of this chapel's being founded by King Henry I in that reign at latest"  According to Dr Ellison's MSS this chantry was founded by Laurentius prior of Durham  It was refounded in the year by Richard de Emeldon  "Richard de Emeldon who had been above twelve times mayor of Newcastle was permitted by letters patent from King Edward III to build upon a piece of vacant ground over against the chapel of St Thomas the martyr that he might present it to three chap∣lains to procure their prayers for him whilst he was living and after he was dead And also for the souls of his wives and his father and mother c every day at the altar in St Nicholas which was dedicated to John the Baptist and John the Apostle and Evangelist This gentleman died about the th or th of the reign now mentioned as is clearly ga∣thered from the authority above and the letters in which this chantry is mentioned beat date the sixth of this reign and therefore it is a mistake to suppose this chantry founded in the reign of Henry VI which was almost an hundred years after"  "The priests set apart to attend this altar were every day to pray for his soul and the others above mentioned And by an order from the then Richard Lord Bishop of Dur∣ham the chaplains for the time being were obliged on the anniversary of his death every year for ever to celebrate his memory with a solemn tolling of the bells and devoutly sing¦ing by note in the evening of the anniversary and on the anniversary itself and solemnly to sing mass for the soul of Richard himself and the souls abovementioned and the souls of all the faithful departed And after mass one of the chaplains was to distribute among poor people the sum of s d and this annually for ever This together with several other things was ordered by Richard Bishop of Durham in the third year of his consecration A D which was with all other things mentioned in the charter con∣firmed by Edward III in the th year of his reign Thus it appears that this chantry is of a much older date than the reign of Henry VI"Bourne's History  See V  llis'

GEORGE'S PORCH  GREY for what reasons I know not has supposed this to have been built by one of the kings of England  Chorographia    Bourne without giving his authority says that it was one of the chantries of St Nicholas' church  Bourne's History"It hath under it" says he "a vault and there is on the north window the head of the King the father of the lady which whom St George delivered from the dragon"  "On the east window" he continues "is still remaining some of the painted glass There is particularly the picture of St Lawrence and some skin marks and coats of arms It has been a beautiful little placeIt is ceiled at the top and has been surrounded with carved work in wood some of which still remains to speak the curious art and commend∣able expence of the days of old"    This place would unquestionably be made use of when the feast of St George was celebrated in Newcastle upon Tyne A D  See Historical Events under that year    July th there was an order of the commoncouncil of Newcastle to give l towards the rebuilding and reparation of this porch  Commoncouncil books  In the ordinary of the society of drapers in Newcastle dated Sept th the brethren are

Tinmouth monasteryof Edward the Confessor and those of St George On the north window is a mermaid combing her hair and a female saint below with a whip in her hand treading on some angry beast    ST NICHOLAS' STEEPLE  NO ideas of the elegance of the design of the forgotten architect or lightness of the execution of the masonry of the pinnacle or upper part of this steeple can be conveyed by descriptions of the pen Mr Pennant  "The tower of St Nicholas' church" says he "is very justly the boast of the inha∣bitants Its height is feetRound the top are several most elegant pinnacles from whose base spring several very neat arches that support the lanthorn an open edifice or∣namented with other pinnacles of uncommon lightness"Tour in Scotland vol iii p  quarto  Dr Stukeley speaking of it in his Iter Boreale p says "It is of a very ingenious model the original of one near London Bridge"  Wallis in his History of Northumberland vol ii p describes it as follows "Four stone images at full length adorn each corner of a square tower out of which rises a curious steeple in height yards foot and quarters decorated with thirteen pinnacles two bold stone arches supporting a large and beautiful lanthorn on which is a tall and stately spire the whole much admired"  STEEPLE OF S  T  NICHOLAS CHURCH Most respectfully inscribed to John Medley Esq Alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne  allows it to be very justly the boast of the inhabitants being a subject truly worthy of the pencil of a Sandby or the burin of a Rooker It is generally thought to be a superstructure  It is probable that the body of the church was new roofed at the same time as there remain at present on the roof timbers the arms of several families the chiefs of whom were magistrates of the town about that timesuch as those of Harding Carlell Lawson Baxter Lockwood c  The shape of this pinnacle which some have thought resembled that of an imperial crown others have supposed to be an imitation of the ornamented cover of the box in which the consecrated host was preserved  and to have been raised upon the original tower in the time of Henry the Sixth  The original tower appears to have had a battlement of open stone work and embrasures like those still remaining on the top of Durham Abbey At present this part is built up with bricks which probably was done at the erection of the upper structure However that may be it is plainly an afterwork which whatever it may have added to the strength most certainly in some degree impairs the general beauty of the fabrick Some have ascribed the building of this steeple to David  The author of a book intitled A Journey through Scotland published in speak∣ing of St Giles's church in Edinburgh says "A top of this church is erected a large open cupola in the shape of an imperial crown that is a great ornament to the city and seen at a great distance King David erected a copy after this over St Nicholas' church in Newcastle but it does not near come up to it" P  the first king of Scots of that name but I think very erro∣neously and that those have much more probability on their side who suppose it to have been raised by Robert Rhodes  Mention occurs of this Robert Rhodes in the Appendix to Smith's edition of Bede's Church History January th as having presented a cross of gold to the shrine of St Cuthbert at Durhamhe is styled "Robertus Rhodes de Novo Castro super Tynam juris regni Anglie peritus et senescallus prioratus Dunelm"  The same person we have noticed before founded in this church the chantry of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist A D  January th "Robert Rodes of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne" con∣veyed a house in Gateshead to William Abletson and Agnes his wife  "Robert Rodes Esquire" occurs in an inquisition taken at the castle of Newcastle A D Also in an instrument dated Also in a deed dated Nov st    April d Robert Rodes occurs "at the castle of Newcastle upon Tyne" taking an inquisition after the death of the Earl of Warwick concerning Bernard Castle  After A D Robert Rodes occurs as one of the bishop's justicesat the same time mention occurs of Agnes his wife  A D Robert Rodes and his wife are mentioned as both dead  I have seen and carefully examined and can therefore attest the truth of all the above evidences  On the ceiling under the belfry of this steeple there is an inscription as follows with the arms of Rhodes "Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes" The same occurs at All Saints and at St John's on the ceiling as in this church  Near the above on the north side of the eastern arch that supports the steeple there is a coat of arms cut in a stone a dolphin between three mullets  The following riddle is preserved in Grey's Chorographia said to have been made by Ben Jonson the poet concerning this steeple  My altitude high my body four square  My foot in the grave my head in the air  My eyes in my sides five tongues in my womb  Thirteen heads upon my body four images alone  I can direct you where the wind doth stay  And I tunc God's precepts twice a day  I am seen where I am not I am heard where I is not  Tell me now what I am and see that ye miss not"  N B The great tower of the cathedral of Durham is yards and feet high according to Browne Willis vol ii p it is only yards and a half  The height of the lanthorn to the vault of York Minster is feet or yards feet  a most munificent  friend in general of St Cuthbert the great tutelar saint of the diocese and more particularly of the churches in Newcastle upon Tyne where he resided  This steeple contained originally but five bells the peal at present consists of eight  Bourne's History"They are" says he "very large ones have a bold and noble found and yet an exceedingly sweet and harmonious one"  The three latter additional ones were given by the corporation of Newcastle who appear to have been charged with the reparation of this structure from time immemorial  See History of Newcastle as a corporate towntime

of the highest part was taken down and new builded with sundry reparations and new fanes"    A D the great bell here which weighed pounds was sent to Colchester to be new cast  Bourne's History    There is a tradition that during the siege and before the town was taken in the month of October the general of the Scottish army sent a threatening message to Sir John Marley then mayor in∣forming him that if he persisted in his refusal to deliver up the town they would direct their cannon so as to demolish this beautiful steeple  The mayor upon this instantly ordered the chief of the Scottish pri∣soners to be taken up to the top of the tower below the lanthorn and returned him an answer that if that structure fell it should not fall alone as their countrymen were placed in it with a view either to pre∣serve it from ruin or be destroyed with itThis spirited reply is said to have had the desired effect in preventing its demolition  IbidThere is an order of commoncouncil dated September th for repairing this steeple which should seem to imply that it had been much battered during the siege of the town    A D this steeple was repaired at the expence of the corpo∣ration of Newcastle upon Tyne  Bourne's History    About the great bell of this steeple having been broken was sent up to London to be new cast The present one weighs hun∣dred weight  Commoncouncil books September d Also

older one  Dr Ellison's MSS    A D the gallery commonly called the SchoolGallery on the north side of the church was built  Ibid  It has been removed  It had the arms of the merchant adventurers on the front of it "At the cast end of it" says Bourne "an addition was made to it by the Rev Dr Thomlinson for the use of his successors the lecturers of St Nicholas and his own family" P  in con∣sequence of the late alterations to the front of St George's porch  Some time between the year and an order having been received from the King to remove the gallery which obstructed the chancel the roodloft in times of popery and the churchwardens re∣fusing to comply therewith Dr Morton then Bishop of Durham wrote to Mr Alvey vicar of this church to inforce their obedience to the royal edict  "Mr Alvey It was required of the churchwardens of St Nicholas according a  his Majesty hath commanded that the gallery which obstructs the chancel should be re∣moved which being not done the churchwardens of AllHallows who were afterwards commanded the like presumed that theirs might likewise stand I pray you therefore to call upon the churchwardens of St Nicholas that they without any longer delay per∣form his Majesty's command and if they shall neglect to do it let me understand that I may question them accordingly and as soon as they begin require the same performance of the churchwardens of AllHallows for their gallery for without farther questioning both must be down and thus commending you to the presence of the Almighty rest your loving friend THOMAS DURESME"Dr

NICHOLAS  THE holy table or altar which in the primitive and in the late re∣forming times was made of wood in the middle corrupted times was generally composed of stone "as more corresponding with the import of an altar whereon the sacrifice of the mass was and is still offered up in the Roman church  Staveley on Churches p  "  This to distinguish it from the smaller altars dedicated to saints in chantries was styled in the papal times the high altar  See before A D and    It appears to have been placed anciently in different parts of the church sometimes in the middle and sometimes in the eastermost part of the chancel according to the different fashions of the building  Staveley ut supra p  The words of Bourne are "The chancel of this church is a very noble and stately one At the top

Eccles Hist lib ii cap Staveley on Churches p    The font of this church with a wooden cover to it of very light and elegant workmanship has either been made or repaired by Robert Rhodes the builder

"IN this church" says Bourne "are many sumptuous windows but that in the east surpasseth all the rest in height largeness and beauty" Grey says that there were in this window the twelve apostles and the seven deeds of charity painted in the glass He tells us also that this window was built by the beneficent Roger Thornton the elder  and that there was this inscription on it "Orate pro anima Rogeri de Thornton pro animabus filiorum et filiarum" At present there is nothing remaining of these pictures but fragmentstwo heads c c  The windows of this church have many of them been entirely new built on the late alterationThe figure of our Saviour in modern stained glass of very miserable execution has been happily concealed by it  ORGAN  STAVELEY is of opinion that organs  History of

MONUMENTS AND MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS FORMERLY IN ST NICHOLAS' CHURCH MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE LATE ALTERA∣TION IN THE INSIDE OF THAT EDIFICE  IN the north part of this church of St Nicholas was a shrine of Henry the fourth Earl of Northumberland who on the day of St Vitalis the Martyr  i e  April th fell a victim to the unre∣lenting avarice of King Henry VII to whom the parliament in that year had granted a subsidy for carrying on the war in Bretagne which fell heavy on the people and put the whole country in a flameThe good Earl then Lord Lieutenant wrote to inform the King of the discontent and prayed an abatementThe King's answer was that not a penny should be abated This message being delivered by the Earl with too little caution to the populace who had come in a tu∣multuous manner to complain of the grievance they supposed him to be the promoter of their calamity and instantly breaking into his house at Cock'sLodge near Thirske in Yorkshire murdered him and several of his attendants He was buried in Beverly Minster where  Monuments on the Churches of  St Nicholas All saints  a very magnificent monument some vestiges of which remain was erected to his memory  Collins's Peetage vol ii p  edit Skelton wrote an elegy on his death which is printed in the Reliques of ancient English Poetry vol i p d edit  The bill of the charges of his funeral preserved in Peck's Desiderata Curiosa lib vii N  o  amounts to l d of the money of that age which in modern valuation would now be l s d    Grey in his Chorographia tells us that in this part of the church there was such a monument in his time "that was made in memory of him in his own country he having a house in this town and pa∣rish  See account of the Earl's Inn in the account of the street called the Close  " and that part of the inscription upon it was "Orate pro anima Henrici Percy com' Northumbriae qui per rebellium manus occubuit c"  "The Milbank manuscript" as we read in Bourne's History "says that it was in the north corner of the church that it was a monu∣ment of wood on which was painted an old man our Saviour on his right hand and the Virgin Mary on his left There came a label from her mouth but what it was this authority had forgot but that from our Saviour's was Quaeso Pater fac quod rogat mea mater Then followed some Latin verses done in the rhyming way of the monks but they are so dark and obscure that little can be made of them" The MS goes on "When Mr William Selby was buried this monument was removed out of that corner and Sir George Selby did set his magnificent tomb there""After that it was placed against the wall next to Sir George's tomb and so continued till Mr Lanc' Hodshon got leave of Vicar Nailor to remove it and place his father where it is now I know not"At present no vestiges of this ceno∣taph remain  In the northeast corner of this church was the tomb of Sir George Selby His effigies and that of his lady were at length resting upon pillows with uplifted handsOn the south of the tomb were the ef∣figies of his children in a posture of prayer kneeling with raised handsUpon a marble stone placed in the wall a little above the  tomb was the following inscription "Georgius Selby eques auratus ab antiqua et clara Selbeiorum de Selby in comitat' Ebor' familia oriun∣dus quater hujus villae praetor vicecomes comitat' palat' Dunelm'

some∣time alderman of this town and Margaret his wife and their children" In the margin on his side anno on her side  In the north side of the middle porch under the great eastern win∣dow were the remains of a monument on which statues had been inlaid but taken away probably for the sake of the brass On the south side of it was the monument of George Carr  The inscription on Carr's tomb said he died No such name occurs in the list of mayors till so that one of these authorities must be mistaken On the shields were the arms of Carr alonethen Carr impaling Birdthen Carr's skin mark These skin marks were not used instead of arms but rather as distinct insignia appropriated to the profession of merchandise On an inverted tablet over this monument were the cha∣racters which have been corrupted into J H S and made to signify Jesus Hominum S  lvator whereas they are certainly no more than the three first letters in the Greek na  of JesusSee Preface to D Casley's Catal p  I am of opinion that here has been the altar of the second chantry of our Lady which was founded by George Carr See account of the chantries  with this inscription  "Orate pro anima Georgii Car quondam majoris istius ville qui obiit anno Domini millesimo cccc Cujus animae propitietur Deus"  The effigies of him and his wife at length resting on pillows with their hands raised Above them an arched canopy with a defaced inscription but a MS in this church gave the following words "For George Car's sawll his wyffes childers sawlls all and to make a so∣lem dyrgemass with all his bruthern in the qwyre and to sing as aperyth in his writing of Rimae"  At the feet of the effigies were the ruins of a large image of our Sa∣viour upon the Cross with an inscription equally dark as the other but said to be this "Our Lady prays him to say at the day"  When the Scots took the town they plundered the churches and these and many more were defaced for they broke down the carved work thereof with axes and hammers  On the north side of the southeast porch was a small monument commemorating the wife of William Wrightson Esq "Near this place lies the body of Isabel the wife of William Wrightson Esq

in the county of Northumberland EsqA figure in statuary marble as large as life bearing a resemblance of the features and person of the late Mr Ridley at the period to which the medallion and inscription allude is represented in a Roman habit sitting in the curule chair the seat of magistracy with a serious but placid countenance as con∣sidering of the general welfare of the people over whom he presided under the chair are placed the scales and fasces as emblems of justice and authority beneath this is the entablature containing the follow∣ing inscription "To the memory of Matthew Ridley Esq of Blag∣don and Heaton in the county of Northumberland senior alderman of the corporation of this town and governor of the company of mer∣chantadventurers He four times served the office of mayor in which station in the year he rendered essential service to his country averting by his prudence and activity the attack meditated against this town by the enemies of the House of Brunswick and thereby materially checking the progress of their arms He was unanimously elected by his fellow burgesses to represent them in five successive par∣liaments and retired from that situation when the declining state of his health rendered him incapable of conscientiously fulfilling the duties of it He lived respected and beloved and died unfeignedly lamented April Aged "  "The base of the monument is formed by a medallion on which the town of Newcastle is represented by a female figure crowned with turrets having a shield by her bearing the arms of the town near her is an urn from which are seen issuing salmon the peculiar attribute of the river Tyne attacked by Rebellion who treading on the crown and sceptre ensigns of royalty bears in one hand the torch of sedi∣tion  in the other the sword of destruction in an attitude of suppli∣cation she inclines herself towards an armed figure who protects her with his shield and with a sword in his right hand resists the figure of Rebellion on the shield are represented the arms of the family of Ridley the helmet is ornamented with a bull which is the crest As a finishing under the medallion two cornucopias are introduced representing the general effect of plenty attendant on the care of active magistrates connected by a civic crown the reward amongst the Romans of civil virtue The figure is placed against an obelisk of white marble eight feet high on the top of which is a very elegant urn bearing the family arms emblazoned and on the foot of it is engraved the motto "Constans Fidei" The whole is relieved by a ground of dovecoloured marble  "We feel it a justice we owe to the superior abilities of the artist to add that this elegant monument was executed by John Bacon Esq of the Royal Academy whose natural genius unassisted by foreign travel has raised him decidedly to the first rank in his profession and has enabled the present day to vie with the most celebrated ages of antiquity in works of sculpture The many invaluable proofs of ex∣cellence with which this artist has enriched his native country as well as foreign lands it is unnecessary here to enumerate until the magni∣ficent monument in WestminsterAbbey designed and executed by him to the memory of the late Earl of Chatham shall moulder into dust his fame will be had in remembrance  Newcastle Courant  "  "M S Janae Yeldardi Alvey

Saturday August th  AFTERNOON LECTURERS AT ST NICHOLAS'S  WILLIAM PEIRSON occurs A D  St Nicholas' Register November st also May Randall's MSS from a MS of Dr Hunter "written soon after the civil wars" say "It appears that Peirson lecturer of this church about the year was paid quarterly a salary out of the town of Newcastle and likewise for several years after during his continuance" See also lecturers of the other churches "The salaries were not one and the same but added and increased as the town thought fit Upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon and the parish did contribute for their preaching in the afternoons Some time after the town of Newcastle made an addition to the former salaries and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and after∣noon upon which augmentation the parishes gave no farther contribution In this state have the lectureships continued ever since with an alteration still of salaries more or less as there was occasion and at the will and pleasure of the patrons And when any vacancy happened in any of the churches of the town the mayor aldermen and commoncouncil of Newcastle from time to time have chosen another in such room and stead and the Bishop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of by licence such person so chosen being duly qualified  "Note the lecturers of St Nicholas' and All Saints' have this further advantage in it which makes it the more valuable that this preferment does noways disqualify or inca∣pacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of souls" Quere is not the case the same with the lectures of St John's and St Andrew's    Thomas Stephenson is mentioned as lecturer here Aug st  St Nicholas' Register of

Galilean who mounted up to the third heaven and thence fetched those goodly notions which he preached to the worldHe published a book entitled The Mystery of Godliness"There is a print of him prefixed to that work See Granger's Biographical History  Wood tells us he became lecturer of St Nicholas' church without any orders unless those of presbytery He was a great statesmana greater divine "He was

down about three years before he wrote his history  In an authority preserved in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle dated July th mention occurs of "a cross at the FleshMarkett"  Here stood a pillory alsoThe cross was in the center of the street opposite to what are at present called "Bulman's Buildings"    There is a narrow passage leading from the FleshMarket to MosleyStreet near the

by the mob assembled there to wait for the arrival of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland on his way to meet the rebel army  An attack equally cruel and unjustifiable appears to have been made on the same occasion upon another Romancatholic chapel at the Nuns in Newcastle  See Historical Events  I found the following memorandum in Dr Ellison's MSS  "The number of the papists in Northumberland as they were returned into the House of Lords  St Nicholas' in Newcastle    St Andrew's there    St John's there  "  AllSaints is not mentioned  In November the town of Newcastle gave publick notice for all papists to take the oaths of allegiance to his majesty and for this purpose adjourned the sessions    A Mr Walsh is said to have been priest at the chapel in Gateshead which was afterwards removed to a house that once belonged to Sir John Marley the celebrated loyalist in the street called the Close  The chapel in the Nuns was removed to a place the entry to which is near the BlackHorsePant in the BiggMarket where Mr Cordell at present officiates  The chapel in the Close has also been removed since that time to a house near the foot of WestGate at which Mr Warilow is the present officiating priest  From the head of the street called the Side to about the middle of it there is a very steep descent this name is plainly derived from the cir∣cumstance of its being erected on the side of a hill About halfway down it becomes more than double its breadth in the steep descent  Bourne tells us that the east side of the wider part was anciently called "Cordiner or CordwainerRawe  See the description of GunnerTowerWardIt is plain from thence that AllHal∣lowPant and CordinerPlace have been near the head of what is now called the ButcherBank as also that the west row of the Side from CaleCross to PainterHugh was called "FlesherRawe"  i e  ButcherRowThe "going downwards" which seems to have missed Bourne is meant for the descent from AllSaints' church to the CaleCross  The following entry occurs in the Harleian MSS eschaets Ric II "Andreas de Tyndale fuit seisit' die quo obiit de una shopa in villa Novi Castri super Tynam in le FleshewerRawe quam tenuit

postern called the EasternPostern of the Castle that communicated by a very narrow and steep flight of steps with the Side a little above the middle of that streetSee account of the Castle  A little above on the opposite side we descended by a small flight of steps into a short narrow lane which communicated with the bottom of the street called PainterHugh Bourne supposes that this was an∣ciently called SwinburnPlace  It must have been somewhere hereabouts  See account of PinkTowerWard which included "all the west rawe in the Side unto a great waiste upon the CastelHugh sumtime called Olde Laurence Acton's Waiste now Thomas Heryng's foreanents a pant afore Swinborne's doore upon LorkeBurne" This too is the pant which Bourne has erroneously called AllHallowPant  In Corbridge's Plan of Newcastle this is called DogLoop  i e  Leap  At the north end of this lane there was a place called PencherPlace  It has been conjectured that PencherPlace means the place of paunch  i e  tripewomenSed quaere for "Pencher" may have been the sirname of the owner of the property  He adds "perhaps the whole lane was called so"  It went up as far as the late NetherDeanBridge  See afterwards "NetherDeanBridge"    "Under this very high and ancient arch" he continues "I am told the rings are still to be seen that the boats were fastened to which  brought up the merchantgoods when the merchants had their shops in the FleshMarket" This arch was lately taken down  Lort or LorkBurn up which for a considerable way the tide flowed formerly made a division anciently in the lower part

LorkBurn near the SandHill stood the CaleCross  Bourne supposes it to have been called CaleCross because of the cale or broth which was sold there in former times I think much more probably from the herb kail∣wort which also gave a name to broth in the northBourne adds "This seems to have been its original name for I meet with it in the reign of King Richard II and also in a writing dated in the time of King Edward the Third"  In the confirmation of the WallKnowl hospital A D it is called "CaleCross"  In a deed preserved in AllSaints' vestry dated October th it is thus mentioned "In vico qui ducit del CaleCrosse"  In the commoncouncil books October th the name is spelled "KealeCrosse"  which Grey in his Chorographia describes as a "fair one with columns of hewn stone covered with lead"

the street and commu∣nicating with WestGate  Adjoining to this street stood the house of GreyFriars or Minors called also FranciscanFriars  They were one of the most eminent of the four orders of mendicants  Before persons could be admitted into this order they were obliged to give a convincing proof of the disinterestedness of their motives by selling all they had and giving it to the poor  St Francis their founder gave them one of their namesThey were called Grey Friars from the colour of their habit and Minors through humility  Minor  i e  less inferior  Their habit was a loose garment reaching to the ancles with a cowl and a cloak over it when they went abroadthey girded themselves with cords and went barefootedYet it should seem from the prints in Creccelius's Collectanea that the Observants only a rigid branch of the order had their feet uncovered  Their house in Newcastle is said to have been founded by the Carliols  Their great estate according to Leland went by marriage to the family of the Thur∣gills of the Wolds in Yorkshire  wealthy merchants in the time of King Henry III  The site of this house must have been somewhere in the garden of the late Sir Walter Blackett Bart most probably in that part of it which lies opposite to FicketTower  Bourne from the authority of the Milbank MS says it stood near PilgrimStreet Gate and that there was a little lane between it and the walls  The HighFriarChare must have conducted to it being styled in several ancient writings "Vicus qui ducit ad Fratres Minores"  The burialground of the monastery was immediately opposite to FicketTower as ap∣pears before in the old account of FicketWard    Bourne on the authority of ancient writings observes that they were a regular and settled body A D  At a general chapter of this order held at Narbone in France A D it appeared that the English province had seven custodies where∣of the custody of Newcastle containing nine convents was one  See History of English Franciscans The

their orderI found built up in the wall of a house adjoining to the site of the monastery the fragment of a gravestone which has no doubt been taken out of their burialgroundA sword is marked on itthe mutilated inscription runs thus "Hic jacet eming" The last I suppose has been "Fleming" a name which often occurs anciently among the magistrates of Newcastle    Dr John Scot usually called Duns Scotus and the Subtle Doctor entered the order of Minors in this house before A D  Leland from certain old records of MertonCollege in Oxford gathered that he was born in the parish of Emeldon in a hamlet or manor place belonging to that college called Dunstanfrom whence by contraction he got the epithet of DunsHis father's name was ScotThe place belongs to MertonCollege to this day He was the son of a tenant of that houseIn one of his MS works folio D Theolog are these words "Explicit lectura doctoris subtilis in universitate Oxoniensi super quartum librum Sententiarum scilicet Domini

me genuit" upon his tomb seem to contradict the above account but Fuller attributes it to an easy mistake of foreigners considering that Northumberland had anciently comprehended all the lands from Humber to Edinburgh Frith    August st the brethren of this house received eight shillings for their pittance of one day and on the th of September following eight shillings for the same by the King's

house that they and their predecessors had long held a conduit of water running to their convent from a fountain called SevenHeadWells which they had inclosed with stone and put a door to of which they were in possession of the key but the fountain abounding with water they had granted a part of it to the use of the public of that place who abus∣ing their favour had broken the conduit diverted the course of the wa∣ter and hindered them from recovering it the King granted them the sole use of this fountain and empowered them a second time to inclose it lock it up and keep the key thereof in

this order from this house and filled it with observants in their stead  Antiquities of English Franciscans p In Stowe's Annal ed it is said▪ very erroneously that "Henry VII builded a house of Franciscan Friers called Conven∣tualles at Newcastle"    In the year the house of Friars Minors in Newcastle was again made conventual  About the year a reformation was made in this order by Saint Bernard of Sienna and such as accepted it were called Observants or Recollects who had two or three houses built for them by K Henry VII The rest were styled Conventual and had about houses at the dissolution  by King Henry the Eighth  "The following passage occurs in the st vol of the History of the Reformation p  "The Observant Friars of Richmont Greenwich Canterbury Newark and New∣castle were removed out of their houses upon occasion of the imposture of Eliz Barton called the Holy Maid of Kent in and put with the other Gray Friars and Au∣gustine Friars were put in their houses and this was all the severity which at this time followed on it"  The subsequent extract is from the second part of the Antiquities of the Franciscans  "King Henry VII placed the Observants in this seat  i e  their house at Newcastle but whether it was a new house built for them by that King or the old convent of the Conventuals resigned to them by his majesty's command I do not find but believe it was the latter and that the said Conventuals again took possession of it when the Observants were turned out of this as well as out of all their other houses by King Henry VIII And that which confirms me in this opinion is that Burnet says this house was sur∣rendered Hen VIII by the warden friars and novices which was five years after the Observants were suppressed and violently expelled out of all their houses"    It was prevailed  The word prevailed is here made use of because neither the houses above the value of l nor the less abbies were within the statute of suppression  "The Franciscans

Nether or Low Bridge conducts from the foot of the BiggMarket to PilgrimStreet The corporation of Newcastle have lately made on the south side of part of it a covered place for a poultry market which

the American War cDied Ja∣nuary th and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard  The Low or Nether DeanBridge conducted from St Nicholas'  churchyard into PilgrimStreet and has plainly had its name from its situation lower down in the town than the Upper or HighBridge  There was preserved in the town's butch among other writings preserved there A D "a grant by one King Richard for the building of NetherDeanBridge"  In the Harleian MSS Ric II mention occurs of five cottages "juxta le DeneBrigge"  The Roman Wall it is said went along it  Formerly there was a small descent by stone steps from the church∣yard into the LowBridge and at the foot of these steps was an almshouse for two or three poor women which lately remained but has at present no allowance nor is the founder known  Dr Ellison's MSS call it "an hospital in the NetherDeenBridge" It often is mentioned in St Nicholas' old registers c  The PainterHugh by a steep descent conducted from the bottom of PilgrimStreet to the middle of the SideThere is a flight of stone steps on one side for the convenience of foot passengers Bourne de∣rives the name of it from "painter" a rope by which boats are moored and "hugh" a steep hill or bankThe latter is clear but I should suspect the former to have been the sirname of the owner of the property  In a deed preserved in AllSaints vestry dated "Payntor Hugh" occurs Also in another ibid dated There is a strange derivation of the name of this place given by Dr Stukeley in his Iter Boreale p He says it "is probably from the old name Panna corrupted" This Panna the doctor supposes but it is a mere supposition was the ancient name of the station at Newcastle    PilgrimStreet  This street appears to have been called Vicus Peregrinorum as early as the year It is mentioned in the copy of a grant of a house to Brinkburn priory in Northumberland of that date preserved in the ledgerbook of that priory from whence this note was ex∣tracted by Mr Robert Harrison  on I know not what authority is said to have had its name on account of pilgrims who came from all parts of the king∣dom to worship at our Lady's chapel at Jesmond in the vicinity of Newcastle  There was an inn  Perhaps there have been more Pilgrims Inns in this street than one there seems reason also for supposing from the following extract that pilgrims came hither too to visit certain reliques of St Francis that were preserved in the house of Grey Friars near the head of this streetIt is from Bale's Life of Hugh of Newcastle a famous Franciscan of that town "Hugo de Novo Castro Dunelmensis quoque ditionis

occurs in the Carr MS A D of the execution of one Partrage for coining false money in "the greate innes in PilgrimStreet"  Dr Ellison's MSS say that this house called the Pilgrim's Inn was holden of the dean and chapter of Durham and belonged in his time to Mr Ralph Ogle  Bourne describes it as adjoining to the north side of Mr Edward Collingwood's house and exactly yards from the southermost corner of UpperDeanBridge he adds it is holden of the dean and chapter of Durham and belongs at present to Mr James Hargrave  This appears to have been called St Cuthbert's Inn in the time of Henry VIII See the ministers' or bailiffs' accounts of the monastery of Durham th of February Hen VIII remaining in the AugmentationOffice from whence the following is an extract "Novum Castrum super TynamValet in firma unius burgagii ibidem vocat' Seynt Cuthbert's Inne per annum s d jacen' in Pilgramestrete et in parochia Omnium Sanctorum ville predicte"  The last building in this street to which tradition had continued the name of Pilgrim's Inn was pulled down a few years ago by its owner Mr Thomas Barker merchant who has built on the site of it a large house to front the street and converted the back parts of the premises into a starch manufactory Windows of a very ancient model thick wall c as also a crucifix of wood were discovered on pulling down the old building  In the summer of I saw at Canterbury a place for similar purposes where the shoals of pilgrims that went thither to visit the shrine of St Thomas a Becket were ac∣customed to lodge which has undergone little or no alteration in its appearance Chaucer is said to have often slept in it See Gostling's Canterbury p d edition  in this street says Bourne which the Pilgrims in their journey were wont to call at which occasioned their constant coming up this street and so it got its name of PilgrimStreet as the inn did that of Pilgrim's Inn  The meetinghouse of the inoffensive sect called Quakers is in Pil∣grimStreet nearly opposite to the site of the Pilgrim's Inn  Adjoining to it is a buryingground for persons of that denomina∣tion  In Corbridge's Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne of the date of a dissenters meetinghouse is marked hereabouts and not far from the ManorChare  The first place of meeting  George Fox in his Journal p tells us that he came to Newcastle upon Tyne in but meeting with no encouragement and finding says he "we could not have a publick meeting among them we got a little meeting among friends and friendly peo∣ple at the Gateside where a meeting is continued at this day in the name of Jesus" Friend George inveighs with great warmth against the then priests of Newcastle saying that "the power of the Lord rose in me to warn them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them and not long after all these priests of Newcastle and their profession were turned out when the King came in" He adds "one L  dger an alderman of the town was very envious against truth and friends"  I found the following inscription on a stone in a garden belonging to Captain Lampton near the middle glasshouse "Abigail Tizacke daughter of John and Sarah Tizacke departed this life the th day of the th month and in the th weack of her age anno "The "th month" is an expression for December which clearly marks the sect to which J and S Tizacke belonged  which this sect had in the

my remembrance the passage of Virgil which describes the palace of Anchises  "Quanquam secreta parentis  Anchisae domus arboribusque obtecta recessit"Aeneid lib ii l  was purchased with the extensive gardens c around it A D by Mr George Anderson masterbuilder of Sir Thomas Blackett Bart  There is a bird's eye view of it among Kip's Views intitled "The seat of the Hon Sir William Blackett Bart with part of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne"  Grey and Bourne after him calls it a princely house and very stately and magnifi∣cent being supposed to be the most so of any house in the whole kingdom within a walled town It is surrounded with a vast quantity of ground  It is added "That part of it which faces the street is thrown into walks and grassplots beautified with image and beset with trees which afford a very pleasing shade the other part of the ground on the west side of it is all a garden exceedingly neat and curiously adorned with statues and several other curiosities But this house is not more remarkable or memorable upon any account than for its having been the lodgings of King Charles I whilst he was a prisoner at this town"  It appears from Corbridge's Plan that the meetinghouse of the company of spur∣riers was in an apartment in an old pile of buildings immediately below this house a view of which is given in that plate by the title of "Mr Fenwick Lambert's House"On a stone over one entrance "Gloria Deo in excelsis"Over another fronting the street "De bon vouloir servir le Roi"    The almshouses built by Christopher Brigham merchant and after him called

is a very agreeable walk generally frequented in a summer's evening by the gentry of this part of the town" There is a passage into this field from the ManorChare another from PilgrimStreetGate and a third from behind Surgeons' Hall  In a mutilated deed preserved in St Andrew's vestry dated th Ed IV mention occurs of "CarleCroft"In a deed dated August th Ed IV "Johannes Carl  ll Armiger" occurs as

women by  i e  near to the AugustineFreres in Newcastell"  Among the disbursements in an old parishbook in AllSaints vestry dated oc∣curs the following entry  "Alms house in ManorChaire s"  Bourne cites the Milbank MS concerning this place as follows "The chief almshouse in the town is Ward's near the Manour the mills at PandonGate should give them as I remember twenty shillings per annum to buy them coals but old Mr Brand∣ling pulled off the lead on purpose to expell the poor people which he did The mills are now fallen into one Homer's hands and so are lost for ever I have seen the writings and know it"  It is styled in an old deed dated Dec st "John Wardes almous house stondyng in Cowgate nye the Frer Augustyns lately edified and belded by the said John Warde"  Bourne tells us that it was situated at the bottom of a garden belonging in his time to Mr Waters where old persons had informed him they remembered the ruins of such a building  stood near the above founded in the reign of Edward the Fourth by John Warde a rich merchant of Newcastle for twelve poor men and the like number of poor women The site of this building is marked in Speed's Plan of the town in what is now called the ManorChare where an old wall towards the street with a doorway built up in it is still remaining  SILVERSTREET  SILVERSTREET which leads down a very steep hill from the foot of PilgrimStreet to Pandon was anciently called AllHallowGate  Which is said to be "Ex parte boreali ecclesiae Omnium Sanctorum"  as also TempleGate  From templumas lying near or conducting to the church  it should seem from the circumstance of its communicating with AllSaints church It occurs too in old writings with the name of JewGate  In a release dated th October Will III A D mention occurs of two messuages situated "in Newcastle upon Tyne in a certain street or place there called Sil∣verStreet alias JewGate on the north syde of the same street"Extract from a title deed of a house in SilverStreet belonging to Mr John Stokoe  These two names owe their origin it is not improbable to the same cause  i e  the place having been principally inhabited by Jews who dealt in silverplate  In an inrolment remaining in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne dated November th this street is mentioned by the name of "SilverStreete thus AllHallowGate"    There is a presbyterian meetinghouse in SilverStreet of which Mr George Ogilvie who died April st aged years was ministerHe was succeeded by Mr Sheilds  CHURCH OF ALLSAINTS OR ALLHALLOWS  THE conjecture of Grey  Greycited by Bourne  in his Chorographia that this church was dedicated to AllSaints or AllHallows from the ancient name of that part of the town Pampedon which he adds was so called from the Pantheon at Rome appears to be too ridiculous to deserve either to be considered or refuted  It is not known at what period this church was built Bourne met with an account of the date of in which it is mentioned as erected at that time  Bourne  "This church seated upon a hill much about the same height with the situation of St Mary's in Gateshead and upon the same line with it is not so long as St Nicholas' being only yards foot and ¼ long but it is broader as being yards feet in breadth" Ibid  "The extent of the parish of AllSaints is as follows Beginning at SandGate it is bounded by the river to St

ago no more could be read than hic tumulatus dono Dei datus mitis cleropromotor ecclesiarum My authority imagines this to be the burial place of Robert Rhodes He says the picture upon the stone was very like that of Roger Thorn∣ton all the difference is that the gown of this picture is not so deep as that of Thornton'sHe conjectures it to be the burial place of Ro∣bert Rhodes because of the words promotor ecclesiarum Lib All Hall The words promotor ecclesiarum are not now to be found However" continues Bourne "had they been there still I think they are but a weak argument to prove that Robert Rhodes was buried here when it is considered that he founded a chantry in St Nicholas' that his own soul and his wife's might be prayed for For people were generally buried in the same church and near the very place where they erected a chantry or an altar But whoever it is this I think may be safely concluded from the grandeur of the gravestone that he was some wealthy person and from his being promotor ecclesiarum that he was also religious  "The effigies is very tall and is surrounded with very curious pictures of the saints and some other things but the brass is now tearing off and going very fast into ruin It is a pity he adds there should not be more care taken of it as it is an ornament to the church and the monument of its benefactor The promotors of churches should be always remembered with the most grateful respect that they may be shining lights to the most distant ages"  Bourne gives an epitaph said to have been made upon Robert Wal∣las formerly clerk of this church  "Here lies Robin Wallas  The king of good fellows  Clark of AllHallows  And a maker of bellows  He bellows did make till the day of his death  But he that made bellows could never make breath"

preference to his father's  It appears by the pedigree in an ancient visitation of Northumberland copied among the Harleian MSS p b that one Hodgkin Thornton was the father of the first Roger Thornton who married to his first wife there is a transposal in the MS which the inscription on the plate enables us to correct the daughter of Law by whom he had issue John Roger and Gyles Thornton John

TrinityHousebelonging in to Robert Gibson of N Shield  taylor    PANDON  PANDON or Pampedon anciently a distinct town from Newcastle was united thereto by a charter of King Edward I A D  See History of Newcastle as a corporate town    Horseley the learned author of the Britannia Romana  Britannia Romana p  "This place of Pandon" says Grey in his Chorographia p "is of such anti∣quity that if a man would express any ancient thing it is a common proverb "as old as Pandon"  Since Grey's time the proverb has been corrupted into "as old as Pandon Gate"  has conjec∣tured  with great probability that the latter syllable of Pandon was deen a hollow or a brook No one has hazarded a probable etymon of the first syllable That the Romans called it Pampedon or Pantheon from some building like the Pantheon at Rome having stood in it is an assertion too ridiculous to deserve refutation I shall mention in a note some other conjectures which have been made on this subject with equal felicity  Bourne says that "there is some doubt about the reason of the name some imagining it came from Pandana one of the gates of Rome which was so called "quia semper pa∣teret" because it stood always open But I dare say this could never give name to the town of Pandon which being in all probability a Roman place of defence was rather obliged to be always shut"  Others have imagined that it came from one Pandara a Scottish virgin saint but for what reason they know best  In a deed preserved in AllSaints vestry dated the name is spelled "Pampdene" And in another ibid dat Ed VI "Pampden"    The kings of Northumberland after the departure of the Romans are said to have had one of their palaces in Pandon A very ancient house now almost entirely rebuilt but which retained till very lately the name of PandonHall  Bourne tells us that in his time this was "rebuilt in some measure" but he adds "There are still remaining many ancient walls and parts of this building it was of con∣siderable bigness having been according to tradition on its north front in length from Stock Bridge to CowGate and on its west front in length from its west corner beyond that lane that leads into Blyth's Nook It was built in the times of the he p  a  hy"  In a probate of the will of Henry Brandling of Newcastle merchant preserved in the archives of the corporation of that town and dated July  th there i  mentioned "a greate howse called PandonHall"  In St Andrew's register of burial a person is mentioned a  having lived in "Pandon Hall"  I have some suspicion that PandonHall was anciently called King John's House The MS Lase of Alderman Barne p tells u  "King John's house has nothing of it left the ground whereon it stood being covered with new buildings""By what fatality" says Mr Wyndham speaking of an ancient building at Wa  nford Archaeologia vol v p "so many ancient edifices came to be attributed to King John and to bear his name I am more disposed to wonder at than to attempt to investigate"  has been handed down by tradition if not  as the very mansion yet as erected on the site of their palace "A safe bulwark" says Grey "having the Picts' Wall on the north side and the river Tyne on the south"  Near PandonHall says Dr Stukeley in his Iter Boreale p was found a seal ring now in Mr Warburton's possession who has en∣graved it in his Map of NorthumberlandSee a facsimile copy in plate of Miscellaneous Antiquities No  There was anciently a street in Pandon called HoneyLane I know not where to six the site of it  In a deed preserved in AllSaints vestry dated Pentecost a tenement is described as extending "a via regia in Pampdene ex parte australi usque ad viam nuncupat' Hony∣layn retro ex parte boreali"    Mention occurs of a watermill near PandonGate Hen VI The milldam was on the outside of the town's wall in the King's dikes  In a deed that lies before me  "July th Hen VI John Richardson mayor of Newcastle and the community of that town demise to John Warde "quandam parcellam soli vasti infra muros Domini Regis ville predicte juxta portam vocat' PampdenYate prout jacet ibidem contigue dicto muro continendo ulnas in longitud' ab eodem muro versus austrum

parcellam soli infra dictum murum quoddam molendinum bladosum aquaticum et super et in dicta parcella soli extra dictum murum unum stagnum pro eodem molendino c"  In a deed dated October th Eliz mention occurs of "Le PattenDeane" for PandonDenenear is "venella vocat' le BlindeChaire" which must have been not far from PandonGate    The arch that crosses PandonBurn is called StockBridge  It occurs in Grey's Chorographia A D also with this nameQuaere if it be derived from the circumstance of selling stockfish at it Stockfish are men∣tioned in the Wardrobe account Ed I published by the Society of Antiquaries  which Bourne supposes was anciently made of wood It appears to have  been of stone about the time of Edward I Formerly the river flowed up to it every tide and there was a fishmarket near it  An almshouse at StockBridge is mentioned in a will dated August but it is alike unknown by whom or at what time it was founded  "Lib Testam N  o  in Consist Dunelm p William Copland pullymaker by will dated August st bequeathed to the poor of StockBridge almshouse d"    A pile of buildings taken down lately to widen the street here∣abouts was formerly called Alvey's Island  "A place" Bourne tells us "which was formerly called the Island as says tradi∣tion because in former times when the tide flowed up to the StockBridge there was thereabout a hill of sand which at the tide's leaving it appeared like an island They call it at present Alvey's Island because it belonged to one of that name It is the very place in which stand the house cellars and malting of Mr George Hinkster which are bounded on the west north and south by the King's Street and on the east by a waste piece of ground of the Lady Goldsburgh which was formerly called the Stones"  These buildings the site of which was anciently a hill of sand were situated between the foot of ManorChare the foot of SilverStreet and StockBridge  The street near this place extending from the foot of SilverStreet to the head of the BroadChare still retains the name of CowGate the ancient appellation of ManorChare  See before account of ManorChare Bourne informs us that some eminent men lived formerly in CowGate such as Gilbert de Cowgate Walter de Cowgate c  In Corbridge's Plan of the town the continuation of CowGate to the foot of the ManorChare is called "DuckHill" alias "StoneyHill" In Bourne's Plan "DuckHill" in BroadChare is that passage of communication between BroadChare and SpicerLane  Near the foot of the ManorChare alias CowGate was a street or place called EwGate as appears by a deed dated March th and an indenture dated th March both relating to the same property and communicated by Mr John Stokoe the last was made between Wolslan Paston gentleman and John Sherwood mason and de∣scribes the premises as follows "All that messuage burgage or tenement and garth with the appurtenances situate standing and being within the town and county of New∣castle upon Tyne in a certain street or place there called EweGate boundering upon a messuage belonging to Mr Anderson towards the east a parcel of ground belonging to the mayor and burgesses called the MiddenStead upon the west part and extends itself from the said street called EweGate on the south to the town's walls backward on the north"    The street into which we enter when we have passed StockBridge  the way to WallKnoll was anciently called FisherGate  Bourne tells us that in a writing drawn when Henry le Scott was mayor of New∣castle about the year some land is described as extending itself "in longitudine a commum via super le WallKnoll in australem partem domus fratrum de Monte Car∣mel usque ad communem viam que solebat ducere versus FisherGate" This monastery was at the top of WallKnoll He supposes the common way here spoken of to have been those stairs beside Mr Green's house at the StockBridge which lead up to the gar∣dens there and which were it not for a wall would directly lead from this street to the remains of this monastery  In an inquisition taken at Newcastle Tuesday in Easter week in the th of King Henry V or VI preserved in the Murray MSS the foll  wing occurs "Omnes illi qui  d antiquo a portu ville predicte usque mare causa piscandi transi  runt in eadem villa Novi Castri videlicet in quodam vico eis adtune assignato vulgariter FisherGate nuncupa  o morari solebant pro eo quod idem piscatores nulla regrataria de hujusmodi piscibus per ipsos capt' uti deberent antequam ipsi usque candem villam una cum eisdem piscibus in∣tegraliter provennent in antiq' commetuda  is et p  s' Regis inde salvationem"    A street that winds up an high hill from the ancient FisherGate still retains the name of WallKnoll which it has no doubt derived from the circumstance of the Roman Wall's having gone over the top of it  Knoll signi  ies hill  "It seems to me" says Bourne "to have this name from the Roman Wall going along it for the word knoll signifies an hill or eminence as I gather from the Lord Bishop of London's note in Cambden upon Sevenoke in Kent who says on the east side of it standeth Knowlle so called because it is seated upon a hill And Grey says also positively that it was part of the Picts' Wall"    A few years ago a meetinghouse for protestant dissenters was erected on the WallKnoll of which Mr Richardson was minister  Not far from this in the descent towards LoveLane is a place of worship used by the sect of dissenters called Independents of which Mr William Leighton was minister  Upon WallKnoll stood anciently the house of the Carmelites or WhiteFriars which was deserted by that order and afterwards inha∣bited by the Trinitarians  The Trinitarians or Maturines styled of the order of the Holy Trinity for the Redemption of Captives also of the order of Ingham from their house at a place of that name in the county of Norfolk were brought into England A D and had the lands c of the canons of the Holy Sepulchre allotted them  Their rule was that of St Austin with some peculiar constitutions and they wore white robes with a red and blue cross upon their breasts Their revenues were divided into three parts the first was for their own maintenance the second for that of the poor and the third for the redemption of Christians taken captives by the Infidels There were ten or twelve houses of this order in England and Wales  The foundation charter of this house  Leland in his Itinerary vol viii p new edition tells u  that "there was a house in Barwike ordinis S Trinitatis but Antony Beke Byshope of Dur  sme destroyed it and then one William Wakefelde master of the house in Barwyke at the defacing of it cam to Newcastell and by the aid of Gul' and Laurence Acton bretherne both mar∣chaunts of Newcastell builded within the towne of Newcastell a howse o  the religion S Trinitatis where Wakefeld himself was first master"  is dated the Wednesday be∣fore Pentecost A D It was confirmed by the Bishop of Durham October d and by the dean and chapter there April th The founder was William de Acton burgess of Newcas∣tle This house was dedicated to St Michael  In a deed now lying before me of the date of  property situated on the KeySide is described as lying "inter tenementum ministri et fratrium dom  s Sancti Mi∣chaelis de la WallKnoull ex parte orientati c"  In a record preserved in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne dat  d July th mention occurs of "twothird par  W  Knowle  alias St Michael's Mount"  and the place where it stood was called from its high situation St Michael's Mount  William de Wackefeld was appointed the first warden the society were to consist of three chaplains of this order one whereof to be warden three poor and infirm persons and three clerks to teach school and instruct in the chapel of the house The property by which they were to be supported consisted of a tenement that be∣longed to Hugh de Haldenby two cellars opposite to CaleCrosse a  piece of ground near the townwall a rent of s d from a house near Lorteburn a rent of s d from a tenement in the FlesherRawe and another of s out of a tenement opposite CaleCrosse all given by the founder in frankalmoigne The master of St Ro∣bert's at Knaresburgh in Yorkshire was to be visitor to visit them annually about Trinity Sunday on which occasion the master of this house was to present him with an horseload of fish and make other proper recompense for his trouble failing him the mayor and bailiffs of Newcastle were to be visitors  Three beds were always to be kept prepared for accidental guests  Bourne's History Appendixat full length"confirmatio hospitalis de WallKnoll infra villam Novi Castri"    February th King Edward III after an inquisition made by John del Strother mayor and eschaetor of Newcastle granted a licence of mortmain to the Carmelites of that place to enable them to grant the WallKnoll in which they themselves had formerly resided to William de Acton to found thereon this hospital of St Trinity anew and to enable the said William to assign to it a messuage that once belonged to Hugh de Haldenby two cellars and a piece of ground lying between the land of John de Stanhope and that of Thomas Milson and l s d of his annual rents all in that town in part of their support and for the maintenance of their

etymon of the name which perhaps will not be thought very satisfactory"The word forth or frith" says he citing Blount's Law Dictionary in verbo Frith "as it is anciently called comes from the Saxon word frith which signifies peace for the English Saxons held several woods to be sa∣cred and made them sanctuaries From this definition of the word it may be no impro∣bable conjecture that the ancient Saxons inhabiting about the parts of the wall Roman Wall where the town now is gave the name of Frith to this place as it was perhaps en∣dowed with gloomier shades and darker recesses the awful exciters of heathen superstition than other places about the town were"  which is said to have been  anciently a fort belonging to the castle  Bourneyet he adds "without any just authority" Grey's Chorographia p  and to have been given to the townsmen of Newcastle for their good services by King Edward III  The corporation of Newcastle occur as paying rent for it soon after the restoration of King Charles II  In a list of old salaries paid by the corporation of Newcastle dated Dec d and preserved in the books of the commoncouncil occurs the following "The rent of the Firth paid for him  i e  the sheriff due at Michaelmas l s d"  King Henry III is said to have given licence in the d year of his reign to dig coals and stones in the Forth  Gardiner's England's Grievance of the Coal Trade

the feasts of Easter and Whitsuntide to the Forth with the maces sword and cap of maintenance carried before them  "Undoubtedly the vast concourse of both young and old at this place at these seasons of the year rather than at any other about this town is the remains of this ancient custom"  there was an order of commoncouncil to lease out the Firth and paddock adjoining under the common seal of

the WestGate divides the county of Northumber∣land from the county of Newcastle upon Tyne A gallows stood lately on the Northumberland side of this runner where a temporary one is  occasionally erected on the same site for the execution of criminals be∣longing to that county  The owners of houses in the street without the WestGate have votes in the election of members of parliament for the county of Northum∣berland A road branches off here on the left hand leading into the Close by the Firth and Infirmary and another road turning upon the right hand conducts to the TownMoor c past the Warden's Close which belonged to the monastery of BlackFriars Bourne after Grey tells us it seems to be called the Warden's Close  "For" says he "Grey tells us the warden of Tinmouth had his house garden fish∣pond c here" and adds "this indeed is not improbable for the monastery of the BlackFriars was dependant upon the priory of Tinmouth" and "there are still the seeming remains of fishponds gardens c"I have to observe upon the above that at the entrance to Warden's Close one may easily discover the remains of a small fortthe other inequalities seem to have been formed by throwing up earth for breastworks by the Scots at the siege of the town in Yet there occurs in Madox's Formulare An∣glicanum a record dated July th which mentions fishponds at that time in this placeIt is a lease from John Rokesburgh prior of the BlackFriars in Newcastle and the brethren thereof to William Hays of a certain great close of theirs built round with a stone wall for the term of his life at the yearly rent of shillings and allowing him to fix a small leaden pipe of a bore large enough to admit a wheaten straw to their aqueduct running in and through that close to their monastery in order to supply his fishponds with water c  It appears by the commoncouncil books July th that certain referees for bringing water to SandGate were appointed to view the conduit at Warden's Close and take some washers with them to view the water and report There is an order ibid dated July th to bring water into the town of Newcastle from the Warden's Close "there having bene formerly time out of the memory of man a conduit of water att the north end of the Warden's Close which water had its course and passage into the War∣den's Close and from thence thro' the BlackFriars and soe came into this towne"" Of late years the free passage and conduit hath bene stopped"  Bourne speaking of Shoulder of Mutton Close which he supposes anciently to have been part of the Warden's Close says "There is in it a cistern of water which a friend of his imagined supplied the Black Friars" and adds "the well belonging to this monastery may proceed from it"Mr Bertram Anderson and Mr Fawcus senior informed me that they remembered a reservoir in the Shoulder of Mutton Close from whence a pipe con∣ducted through the TownWall to the Friars c  The publick fountains which at Newcastle are of a particular construction having each a small square reservoir before them for retaining the water for the use of horses or for common domestic purposes are called pants  Dr Thomas Henshaw in Skinner's Etymology in verbo tells us that pond was an∣ciently pronounced pand which Skinner derives with great probability from the AngloSaxon pyndan to inclose or shut up I am inclined to suppose that pant is no more than pand by a very small corruption meaning a little reservoir or pond In a deed dated relative to the publick fountain in the marketplace of Durham which is of construction similar to those at Newcastle I find this word used "Ejusdem fontis caput vulgariter nuncupat' le Pant Head"  The earliest account I have found of aqueducts bringing water into the town of New∣castle is dated "Novum Castrum super Tynamconfirmatio pro fabric' piporum ducentium aquam ibidem" Pat Ed III p m Murray and Aubone MSS  Leland tells us in his Itinerary vol viii p speaking of Newcastle upon Tyne when he visited that place "there be three hedds of condutes for f  esch water to the town"  because it belonged  to the wardens of the priory of TinmouthI am rather inclined to think it a corruption of Wardell's Close  Amongst the writings in the town's hutch A D was "a lease of Wardell's Close made to Christopher Blunt"  the sirname of some former lessee Before we come to the Warden's Close on the left hand is the entrance to the new medical baths of which a plan and elevation have been published inscribed to John Erasmus Blackett Esq mayor of New∣castle "W Craneson arch  t  R Beilby sculpsit" See plan of the town  Higher up on the right hand and near St John's WorkHouse is the entrance to the Lunatick Hospital  October th it having been represented to the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne that a piece of ground  In the workmen employed in digging the foundation of the Lunatick Hospital in the Warden's Close found an old brass seal which was given by Mr Newton the archi∣tect to Mr Wardell then vicar of Corbridge I read the inscription "Vis et Deus noster" See a representation of the impression it gives Plate II of seals N  o  Can it have been the first seal of the Black Friars However that may be I should think it has certainly belonged to some religious house in Newcastle  was wanted for the site of an hospital intended to be erected in or near to that town for luna∣ticks belonging to the counties of Northumberland Durham and New∣castle upon Tyne and the Warden's Close a field without the walls of that town between NewGate and WestGate having been judged the properest situation for it they had appointed a committee of the com∣moncouncil  to portion off a part thereof for that purpose upon whose report that they had measured and staked out a plot of ground for the site of the intended hospital the commoncouncil aforesaid ordered that a lease should be granted in trust for the use abovementioned from the Christmas day following for the term of ninetynine years under an annual rent of two shillings and sixpence  Commoncouncil books  "Containing in length from the northwest corner to the southeast corner about ninety yards from the southwest corner to the southeast corner about an hundred yards and in breadth from the north west corner to the southeast corner about sixty yards"    Dec th the corporation of Newcastle granted leave for a passage to be

year there was a continued row of buildings on the east side of SidGate    The street turning to the left hand on the outside of NewGate has the name of GallowGate  I find this street called "Galogate" in a deed belonging to St Andrew's church bearing date th of Edward IV  because the malefactors for the town of Newcastle pass along it on their way to the gallows which stands on the entrance to the TownMoor in a place called GallowsHole  A lane at the head of this street intersecting the road from WestGate to the TownMoor joins the Carlisle road at QuarryHouse  The street proceeding straight on from NewGate to BarrasBridge is called SidGate  i e  The way leading straight on to the street called "The Side"  by the common people that live in it and of late by its politer inhabitants PercyStreet  The lane that leads from SidGate or PercyStreet to the Leazes an∣ciently styled "MylnChare  In a deed belonging to St Andrew's church dated Hen VIII a tenement is de∣scribed as situated "in vico vocat' le Sidegate extra muros dicte ville Novi Castri inter ve∣nellam vocat' Myln Chare ex parte occidentali et viam regiam ex parte orientali c" It has evidently had this name

Newcastle and dated "Blindman's Loaneing" occurs "Loaning" signifies lane in the vulgar dialect of the North  Some old houses that stood near the buryingground of the dissenters and which were lately purchased by the corporation and pulled down were called "The Swirle Houses" from their situation near the swirl or runner which at this place empties itself into SidGate or PercyStreet  has sat in it

rebellion under Charles I  Grey's ChorographiaIn Speed's Plan buildings are marked all the way on the west side of this street and joining with the east row of SidGate or PercyStreet  A wide and wellbuilt street at present conducts from PilgrimStreetGate to the BarrasBridge which with great propriety is called "Nor∣thumberlandStreet" A range of houses just above the gate have the name of "NorthumberlandPlace"  On the right hand a little way out of the gate a row of good houses has lately been erected it branches off to the east and is called in honour of the late Sir George Savile Bart "SavileRow" Near this there is a little opening denominated "LisleStreet"  Opposite to SavileRow stands a large building wherein the very numerous sect called methodists assemble for divine worship called the OrphanHouse  It was founded by the Reverend John Wesley A M formerly of Lincoln College OxfordIt is a capacious building containing apartments for the priests c    A little nearer to PilgrimStreetGate on the other side was some years ago a conventicle called "The Tabernacle" but was deserted of its pastor and has since been converted into dwellinghouses  A fanatick of the name of Mackdonald erected a building called the Tabernacle down an entry almost opposite to the OrphanHouse but meeting with little or no encourage∣ment he left the town and went to Manchester

Mary Magdalen  Vulgarly called "Maudlin" a common corruption of "Magdalen"  Speed says erroneously that this was a house of nuns  some parts of which con∣verted into dwellinghouses still remain is said to have been founded by King Henry I It was a priory or hospital for a master brethren and sisters to receive persons afflicted with the leprosy  The leprosy was hereditary and infectious it might have been caught by the saliva of a leperif a found person drank after himby the touchby lying in the same bed and by coition Hospitals for lepers erected in almost every town prove that it raged here in former times with great virulence  a dreadful contagious disease which anciently from whatever cause appears to have been very common in this kingdom  A bull was granted to this house by Pope Alexander the third or fourth of that name the original of which I have seen It confirmed to the master and brethren the possession of their house gardens rents woods and other property and favoured them with an exemption from tythes  "Alexander Episcopus servus servorum Dei dilectis filiis magistro et fratribus hospi∣talis leprosorum Sancte Marie Magdalene Novi Castri super Tynam

BarrasBridge was so called from its conduct∣ing to the Barrows or buryingground of the Magdalen hospital  See account of FicketTowerWard where the same word occurs seeming plainly to mean a buryingground Bourne supposes the MaudlinBarrows to be the present "Sick Man's Close" barrows signifying tumuli graves and sepulchres  Bourne tells us also that "some have imagined it to be called so from a person of that name who was its builder or a benefactor to it" Other accounts he adds derive its appellation from the word barracado"St Andrew's church" says the Milbank MS "is the oldest church in town because it is next the Barras which hath been the ancient barracado of the town" It appears by the following quotation from Hearne's edition of the Chronicon of Whethamstede vol ii p that barriers for the defence of a town were erected in different parts of it and indeed what would it avail to have it barricaded only in one place "John de Cella" says that writer "made abbot of St Albans A D and who died A D did as follows amongst other good works Item bar∣reras illas quas predecessor suus pro defensione ville Sancti Albani in diversis illius parti∣bus suis in temporibus erigi jusserat" There is a reference from the word barreras ex∣plaining it by repagula barriers There were such erections also about NewcastleSee Froisart's ChronicleBattle of OtterbournSee also before in the account of EverTowerWard where mention occurs of the barriers beyond GallowGate without NewGate "as men go to the gallows"    On the north side of BarrasBridge before the chapel of St James a great cross appears to have stood in ancient times it was destroyed as a piece of idolatry at the grand rebellion  By the fanatical John Pig town's surveyorSee Bourne's History    From hence we enter upon the TownMoor  This large track of ground appears to have been called anciently "CastleMore"  Bourne  Page et seq  on I know not what authority tells us that it was ori∣ginally a wood very famous for oaks out of which have been built many hundreds of ships and all the houses of the old town of New∣castle to the burgesses of whom it is said to have been given by Adam of Jesmond  The MS Life of Alderman Barnes so often cited speaking of CastleField and CastleMoor says "There was a wood given to the town by Adam of Jesmond lying on the north and now called the TownMoor to which for the benefit of freemen they have added the CastleLeeses purchased of our author Barnes amongst other proptietors"  about the reign of King Henry III More probably it has been originally one of the appurtenances of the corporate town of  Newcastle for which the burgesses paid their feefarm rent to the crown  See History of Newcastle as a corporate towncharter of Ed III dated th May where the following clause occurs "The burgesses and their predecessors ever since they farmed the said town with its appurtenances have held the same moor and land called CastleField and CastleMoor as belonging to the said town"    In the st Ed III the TownMoor is mentioned as having from time immemorial belonged to the town of Newcastle upon Tyne as it appeared by an inquisition returned into Chancery  See charter ut supra th May Ed III  It was then de∣scribed as extending from a certain place called "the ThornBush  This ThornBush must have been on the north side of BarrasBridge near a cross that was erect  d there before St James's chapel  near the cross" and then by certain divisions and boundaries set up to∣wards the said town of Newcastle as far as the gallows and so between the posts of the gallows one of which stood on the boundary between the land of the prior of Tinmouth and that of the town of Newcastle and so on by the Quarrel  i e  Quarry Dyke and then by the King's way to the said town  By an inquisition taken at the castle of Newcastle upon Tyne August th in the th year of the reign of King James I  "Et quod qu  dam mora que vocatur le CastleMore incipit a quadam domo vocat' le Sick Man's House c  Bourne says it contains acres rood and perches  CastleMoor appears to have contained acres and the boundaries of it are described at that time as beginning at a certain house called Sick Man's House on the south and so extending to the fields of Jesmond on the east to a certain corner there and from thence turning westward to the gate leading from Newcastle to Morpeth and so on westward near the limits of Coxlodge on the north to the corner of the NunMoor on the west to a certain corner where a hedge was anciently near the CowGate leading from Newcastle to Hexham by the boundaries of the fields of Elswick on the south to the gallows and from thence turning westward and north by the bounds and territories of EastField on the west to a certain corner of the CastleField and turning south and east by the  boundaries of the CastleField on the south to the said house called Sick Man's House  A colliery occurs as working on the TownMoor at the time of the grand rebellion  "In the survey made of the TownMoor" says Bourne "in the troublesome times it was reported that the coalmine or colliery in the TownMoor extendeth itself under the superficies of the TownMoor one hundred acres and that the value of it was to the town l per annum"  An advertisement occurs in the Newcastle Courant to let the TownMoor colliery December  d    March d grass men to take care of the TownMoor occur in the commoncouncil hooks  Archives of the corporation of Newcastle    By an article of agreement preserved in the actbook of the commoncouncil dated April st between the mayor and burgesses and Robert Hunter their neateherd it was stipulated that the four servants of the latter every morning from LadyDay to Michaelmas betwixt four and five o'clock and from Michaelmas to LadyDay between seven and eight o'clock should enter the several gates of the town and blow their horns along the streets as a signal for the owners of cows to bring them out in order to drive them to the TownMoor  October th there was a petition from Humphry Gill and John Cooke to the commoncouncil of Newcastle for leave to make a way and bring coals out of FenhamFields over the TownMoor at the distance of about sixty yards from the highway leading over the said moor and on the th of December following leave was given them by that body to cause a gate to be hung and the way to be paved from the gate to the said highway  Commoncouncil books  There is an order of commoncouncil April th that "SlaytyGate leading out of the TownMoor into Fenham ground and all other new erected gates there without leave of the commoncouncil be immediately stopped up and noe passage there for the future"  There lies before me a pamphlet intitled "The Proceedings of the Stewards of the

State Papers p mention occurs in a letter dated June th of "the moster at Newcastle at a place callide Shellfelde"  Later accounts represent it as a place of public recreation  It appears from the MS Life of Barnes so often cited that during the time that King Charles I was a prisoner at Newcastle before he attempted to escape he was permitted to go out every day with his retinue and play at goff in the ShieldField  In the commoncouncil books March th there occurs a "prohibition of horsecourses in the ShieldField"  Ibid March d and April th complaints occur that some parts of ShieldField had lately been inclosed and that the inhabitants could not recreate themselves therein as usualupon which complaints the recorder is ordered to be consulted  It is at present become private property  In

thereof broken down by several persons presuming to trespass upon the same by riding horses and using other exercises there the owners of the said estate do therefore hereby give notice that they intend to prosecute any person or persons who shall for the future presume to commit any trespass upon the said grounds"    Near the entrance to ShieldField are the visible remains of a great fort

"Before we come to the suburbs of SandGate we must not omit to mention the Keelmen's Hos∣pital it is situated some distance of the town's wall between the Carpenters' Town and SandGate It is a square building done in the form of monasteries and colleges having its low walk round it in imitation of cloisters The area in the middle of it is about feet broad and about ½ feet long There are upwards of

Esq governor Mr Edward Grey Mr Edward Carr stew∣ards of the hostmen's company for the time being and trustees for this hospital" I have been told that Dr Moor late Bishop of Ely upon going down the river in the town's barge with the magistrates observed it and made inquiry about it and being told that it was built by the keelmen themselves every one allowing towards it a penny a tide he said that he had heard of and seen many hospitals the works of rich men but that was the first he ever saw or heard of which had been built by the poor 'Tis a pity that the design of its building is not thoroughly answered but there are some miscreants who would rather starve in sickness or old age than not guzzle a penny in their health and youth"    January th there occurs before the House of

act of parliament for their incorporation or the establishing of the charity formerly paid by their consent for the relief of such of them as were past their labour unless it were under "due regulation or the government thereof in proper hands with sufficient power rightly to manage and apply the same would be an entire ruin not only to them the hostmen but also to the corporation of Newcastle and to the coal trade in general  Hostmen's books  "  January th the hostmen repealed their former order of the th of May because the money collected in pursuance thereof had not been

AllSaints parish said to be occasioned by the great number of poor  in SandGate employed in working the keels on the river whereupon a committee was chosen to inquire into the matter  This committee on their report did not admit that the increase of the rate was owing chiefly to those poor for that since the th of May no collections had been made among the keelmen for the support of their own poor except some occasional ones in their societies and boxmeetings  This committee farther gave it as their opinion that if the former practice of collecting fourpence a tide for every keel in the river ob∣tained by the consent of the skippers and keelmen were revised and put under proper regulations justly divided and consigned to honest hands a constant and sufficient provision might be raised  Hostmen's books    December th the hostmen recommended it to the keelmen to make some agreement for the better support of their own poor and to pay one halfpenny per chalder for each tide And February d a committee of hostmen was chosen to consider the proper heads of a bill after they had collected the sense of the greatest part of the skippers and keelmen on the subject  Nothing however appears to have been finally agreed upon on this occasion  February th the above matter was revived and the host∣men sent instructions to a lawyer to prepare a proper plan for the fu∣ture establishment of an hospital for the relief of the keelmen but this design also came to nothing  Ibid    November th there was a meeting of persons chosen by the keelmen for the above purposes at which it was resolved to raise a fund and reestablish the hospital for the better provision in future of their needy impotent and lame poor by deducting from the wages of every keel's crew one halfpenny for every chaldron of coals  Ibid    "They say but do not" may be applied again to these vain resolu∣tions for nothing more occurs in the books of the hostmen or appears to have been done in this matter  Newcastle Courant November  th Yet see in the Appendix an act which was made for this good purpose A D    Below St Ann's chapel and the new row of buildings called St Ann's after passing

fortune and kept his coachThere was also Mr Owens Mr Wilson and Mr Loma  A Mr Gilpin was also at Newcastle where he practised physic and raised a considerable estate He afterwards took the degree of M D at LeydenThere was a design to banish the Doctor from Newcastle but Barnes by persuading the magistrates of his usefulness as a physician procured him qui∣etness to the end of Charles's reign He claimed to be of Bernard Gilpin's line and had his scutcheon pinned at his coffin" The same authority mentions "Mr Pleasance as a preacher at Newcastle" also "Mr Pell" who married Mrs Ellison of a great and wealthy family and died at Newcastle it appears by St Nicholas' register that he was buried December th The above MS Life of Barnes mentions also the "Bold Mr Rothwell commonly called the Apostle of the North" The Lady Bowes being apprehensive of danger to him from so surly and fierce a people as he was going to preach amongst Mr Rothwell unconcernedly replied "If I thought I should not meet the devil there I would not come thereHe and I have been at odds in other places and I hope we shall not agree there" Such another warrior was this gentleman who could say with Mr Alderman Jurdan who whilst he was in some trouble in the StarChamber and one told him the LordKeeper was against him answered "He had a greater LordKeeper than heThe Lord is my Keeper I will not be afraid"  The following passage occurs ibid p "Mr Bowles son of Oliver Bowles a presbyterian divine had been one evening visiting Sir Henry Vane at his taking leave Sir Henry followed with a candle in his hand to the head of the stairs Mr Bowles de∣sired him not to give himself that trouble Nay says Sir Henry I will see you down Indeed Sir Henry says Mr Bowles I believe you would see us down merrily intending that if Sir Henry Vane might hold the candle all ordinances orders and forms of wor∣ship should go down"  As does the subsequent ibid p "On the King's side there was roaring swearing and de boist behaviour wherever their armies took up their quarters On the Parliament's side there was continual praying preaching and singing of psalms and many had their liv  saved by bullets hitting upon little pocket bibles they carried about with them The cavaliers who had but few bibles amongst them laughed at this but serious Christians were affected with it"The following occurs ibid p "Colonel T  tus complains of the King's Charles the Second's shyness to him for no other reason says the Colonel that I can think of but that his majesty has sometimes found a bible lying in my cham∣ber"    "In

is thus described "All that ground commonly called the Bal∣lastShoars  i e  the uttermost part of the said ground and houses at or on the river of Tyne upon the south where a runnel or a little running water there called the Swerle cometh from the north and runneth thro' the street of SandGate into the said river of Tine which runnel or water is the division or separation of the said county

from the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle to Sir Peter Riddell Knight of all that their messuage or tenement with the appurtenances commonly called or known by the name of St Laurence in the parish of

few miles below that town on the north side of the river  There lies before me a tract in vo pagesintitled "Rules for managing the Gunpowder Magazine at WincombLeeQuay on the north side of the river Tyne c"    OF THE BOUNDARIES  In a MS dated Car I I find the boundaries thus described viz "by land from the runnell called the Sworle in the east of the towne by the shore of Tine to the fields of Elswicke and along the fields of Elswicke to the fields of Fenham and so in the south quaere to the fields of Kenton and along those fields to the fields of Coxelodge and foe towards the east to the fields of Jesmond and along those fields towards the south to BarrasBridge on the south and from that bridge by a vennell leading towards the east to SandiverBridge and from that bridge towards the south in and through SheeleFeeld to a vennell leading to Tyne on the south"  OF THE TOWN AND COUNTY OF NEW∣CASTLE UPON TYNE  THE boundaries of this town by land which were undoubtedly  fixed  A set of march or bounder stones appear to have been put up in the year The following order occurs in the commoncouncil books June st "Thomas Taylor's petition for the march stones was read and ordered that he have fifty shillings more paid him which in all is l s"  It was ordered by the same body June th that in future "the bounders of the corporation be rode in every three years" in order to preserve the rights and property of the corporation  when it first was made a county by itself are described by Bourne as follows  "From a small brook or course of water called the Swerle in time past in the county of Northumberland and now in the county of the town of Newcastle on the east and on the west side of the aforesaid town along by the shore of the water of Tyne unto the fields of the town of Elswick in the aforesaid county of Northumberland by and along the fields of the town of Elswick aforesaid unto the fields of the town of Fenham in the aforesaid county of Northumberland and so towards the north unto the fields of the town of Kenton in the aforesaid county of Northumberland and along by those fields unto the town of Coxlodge in the aforesaid county of Northumberland and so towards the east of the fields of Jesmond in the aforesaid county and by and along the same fields of Jesmond towards the south unto a certain bridge called BarrasBridge in the aforesaid county of New∣castle upon Tyne and from the same bridge in and through a certain lane in the aforesaid counties of Northumberland and Newcastle leading towards the east to another bridge called SandiverBridge in the aforesaid county of Northumberland and from the same bridge towards the south in and through a certain field called SheildField in the aforesaid counties of Northumberland and Newcastle unto a certain  lane or street in the same county leading to the aforesaid water or river of Tyne"  For an account of the additional boundaries by the purchase of cer∣tain lands on the east of Newcastle tempore Ed VI see before under "Suburbs of SandGate"  The boundaries of the jurisdiction and of the property of the town of Newcastle are two distinct considerations It is observable that round the moor the marchstones  i e  boundarystones are placed a little within the hedge that separates the grounds of other proprietors from those of the town of Newcastle  GATESHEAD IN THE COUNTY OF DURHAM  BEDE in his Church History mentions a place which he calls "Caprae Caput" which has generally been supposed to mean Gates∣headquasi the goat's head from the Romans having an inn  Hearne in the preface to his Collection of curious Discourses p speaking of Antoninus' "ad Ansam" has these words "Though this place grew to be eminent and large at last yet at first it was only one diversorium or inn on which there was the sign of the Ansa by which name for that reason the whole station itself was called afterwards a thing not uncommon to several other places both in ancient as well as more modern times"  Dr Stukeley in his Iter Boreale p speaking of Gateshead says "I guess this was a fortified town in the times of the Romans where a ferry was for passage northward but by reason of the buildings no traces of it are left I saw several Roman stones here the recipient parts of their handmills"  The doctor supposed that Gateshead was the Gabrocentum of the Notitia where the second cohort of the Thracians were in garrison as its name in British imports "goat's head I suppose from the sign of some inn" He adds "A goat's head still stands upon the sign of the Golden Lion"  "Caput loci" according to Kennet's Glossary to his Parochial Antiquities signifies the end of a place"ad caput villae" at the end of the town Quaere May not "Gatesheved" mean barely "the end of the road" there having been discovered no traces of a Roman road carried northwards from Newcastle  If Bede confounded "gate" via with "goat" capra which was anciently and is still in the vulgar language of the north pronounced "gate" he would naturally latinize it by "caprae caput" instead of "viae caput" It is observable that in the dialect of the common people in the north of England the way leading through a town is still called "the TownGate"  at this  place with such a sign one of the great military roads ending here before the Emperor Hadrian had erected his bridge and connected it with the station of Pons Aelii on the opposite bank of the Tyne  In the year a battle was fought between William the Con∣queror in person and Edgar Etheling heir to the crown of Scotland in conjunction with Malcolm King of Scots and some Danish pi∣rates upon the common adjoining to this place called Gateshead Fell In this conflict the latter were overthrown the Conqueror having af∣terwards recovered the town now called Newcastle laid it almost level with the ground to prevent in future its becoming a place of refuge to his enemies  Historical EventsFrom Warburton's MS Collections in the possession of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland  In a charter of confirmation by King Henry the Second to the nuns of Newcastle they occur as having two shillings of annual rent out of Gateshead    Hugh Pudsey Bishop of Durham appears to have granted in the year liberty of forestage to the burgesses of Gateshead  The substance of this grant is that from Whitsunday to Martinmas they shall pay d for each cart that shall go to the forest and d for each horse and for a man fishing one farthing Forbidden things to be reservedNo forester within the limits appointed between the bishop's forest and the borough to lay hands upon any burgess or inhabi∣tant or upon his cart or cattle to stop him whether with wood timber or any other thing Contentions between the forester and burgesses to be determined if possible in the borough if not to be referred to the bishop The cattle of a burgess not to be taken out of the borough but to be replevied there if the owners choose The burgesses to have grass rushes fellger I suppose "geare or stuff from the fell" and heath for their own use but not to sell any to others Any burgess digging turf for his own fire if he have no cart of his own to pay d for each borrowed one Any burgess to give his wood to whom he pleases provided the person to whom he gives it lives on this the Durham side of Tyne and it be done with no unfair view but he is not to sell any without the forester's licence The goods of none coming within the limits aforesaid are to be disturbed by the forester Each burgess of Gateshead to have the same liberty of his burgage that the burgesses of Newcastle have A burgess of Gateshead or his goods going into any part of the bishop's land to have the peace of God and St Cuth∣bert and all persons are forbidden to hurt or exact any thing of them There was granted to them at the same time common pasturage common portory to their houses and all the usual customs which they could have of SaltwellMeadows"    The BoldonBook the

Osmundi reddit s d"Gutch's Collectanea Curiosa vol ii p    In the year mention occurs of an hospital  There is said to have been a monastery at Gateshead A D if the place called in Bede's Church History "Caprae Caput" must be understood to mean Gateshead of which one Uttanus was then abbot but of the foundation continuance and destruction of this very ancient house no other memorials have been preserved Tanner in his Notitia Monastica cites on this occasion Bede lib iii cap See also Leland's Col∣lectanea vol ii p "Uttan presbyter' inlustris et abbatis monasterii quod vocatur ad Caprae Caput" Sic Beda scribit addit autem annotator ejus Doctor Smith in loco "Caprae Caput hodie Gateshead ubi nulla remanent antiqui monasterii Uttani vestigia Recentioris quidem pulcherrimam videmus capellam vix adhuc ruinis succumbentem Traditio est cellam fuisse sanctimonialium Novocastrensium licet ejus historiam apud auctores vix inveneris" The place which Dr Smith alludes to and which still re∣mains I take to have been the chapel of the hospital of the Trinity if it was not the original chapel of that of St Edmund The present chapel of St Edmund's hospital  See Plate intitled "Statues of the  Charles II and Jame    which is situated half a mile farther to the south is of the very poorest style of architecture and probably was erected after the obtaining of King James's charter to refound the hospital St Edmund's hospital as shewn before was among the possessions of the nuns of Newcastle and thence the tradition mentioned by Doctor Smith may have had its rise This beautiful old chapel from the style of its architecture cannot I should suppose be older than the reign of King Henry the Third and it is observable that the long  lips of windows are similar to those at the end of the church of Tinmouth monastery and those in the Temple church in London  "It stands" says Grose who has given  view of it "on the east or right hand side of the HighStreet leading to NewcastleBridge from which it is distant about half a mile The west end of it is handsomely ornamented with a number of pointed arche  and niches though the inside seems remarkably plain It consists of a single aisle paces broad by long Some steps at the east end leading to the altar are still re∣maining near them is a grave stone on which is cut a cross similar to that in the jamb of the church door at Jarrow it has also the marks of an inlaid border about it but the brass is gone The arches of the windows except those of the east and west ends which are entirely pointed are round within and pointed on the outside A remarkable orna∣ment is mounted on its east end on a slender rod being a small circle chequered by several bars crossing each other at right angles"  This author is mistaken in the account he gives of this place having been set on fire The Catholic chapel which out of a misguided zeal was set on fire on that occasion was in a mansionhouse adjoining to this ruinous chapel the ruins of which mansionhouse are seen in his viewHe very justly observes that the entrance which is through a low square stone gate decorated with pilasters is seemingly of modern construction The site of the house he adds with its offices and gardens occupied about two acres and a half of landTowards the east end of it are the ruins of a mansion which from the style of its architecture seems to have been built since the dissolution of the monastery perhaps out of its materials This probably was Mr Riddle's house alluded to by BourneThe gateway is probably of the same age Grose also confounds the very an∣cient monastery of Uttan and St Edmund's hospital with this ruin The former un∣doubtedly perished in those depredations of the Barbarians when all the religious houses in Northumberland were destroyed  at Gateshead  dedicated to the Holy Trinity for the maintenance of a chaplain and three poor men to which one Henry de Ferlington gave a farm at Kyhoe in the county of Durham in

of Durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money to be applied for the repairing improving or rebuilding such part of TyneBridge as belongs to the see of Durham  WHEREAS the Right Reverend Father in God John Lord Bishop of Durham is intitled in right of his see to onethird part of an ancient bridge extending across the river Tyne between the town of Gateshead in the county palatine of Durham and the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and whereas by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary flood which happened on the seventeenth day of November one thousand seven hundred and seventy one in the river of Tyne the said bridge was very much damaged broken down in several places and rendered utterly impassable and whereas in order to restore an easy and safe communication between the counties of Durham and Northumberland it is highly expedient that the said bridge should be rebuilt or effectually repaired with all possible expedition and inasmuch as the necessary repairs of the onethird part of the said bridge belonging to the said Lord Bishop of Durham in right of his see and extending from two blue marble or boundary stones on the south side of the said bridge to the said town of Gateshead will be attended with a great expence and however reasonable or proper it may be that the entire sum necessary to be appropriated for and employed in that useful and necessary work ought to be raised out of or secured upon the revenues and possessions of the said see of Durham and that the Lord Bishop of Durham for the time being ought not to bear any greater burthen than shall arise from the interest or annual charge to be paid in respect of the principal money to be raised for the purpose aforesaid yet the said John Lord Bishop of Durham is consenting that a reasonable and adequate sum of money may be raised by the authority of parliament by granting an∣nuities for lives which will not only be speedy and effectual but may be a method less burthensome to the successors in the said see than to the said John now Lord Bishop of Durham by the eventual dropping of lives and the decrease of such temporary charge wherefore may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled  and by the authority of the same that the chancellor of the bishoprick and county pa∣latine of Durham and Sadberge the sheriff of the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge the vicargeneral and principal official of the diocese of Durham the attorney and solicitorgeneral to the Lord Bishop of Durham the principal register or registrar of the diocese of Durham the auditor to the Lord Bishop of Durham the keeper of Aucklandcastle the steward of the halmote courts of the Lord Bishop of Durham the clerk of the halmote courts of the Lord Bishop of Durham the clerk of the great receipt of the exchequer of Durham the register of the court of chancery of Durham the clerk of the chancery of Durham and the keeper of the rolls of the chancery aforesaid the clerk of the itinerant justices and other justices whomsoever in the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge and the bailiff of the borough of Auckland for the time being shall be and they are hereby appointed trustees for putting this act in execution by and under the direction of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham and his successors  Provided always and be it enacted that no person shall be capable of acting as a trustee in the execution of this act during the time he shall hold any office or appoint∣ment to which any salary or pecuniary profit shall be annexed by virtue or in pursu∣ance of this act nor shall any such trustee on his own private account enter into any contract or have any share or interest in any contract relating to the execution of any of the powers contained in this act  And whereas it may be necessary to open a more convenient avenue and passage to that part of the said bridge which belongs to the said see of Durham and to remove the erections and buildings on the same be it therefore enacted that the said trustees or any three or more of them shall and they are hereby authorised by and under such direction of the said Lord Bishop of Durham and his successors as aforesaid to treat contract and agree with any person or persons for the absolute purchase of any estate or interest in any buildings or ground which shall be deemed necessary to be ap∣propriated for the better and more effectually repairing rebuilding or improving such part of the said bridge as belongs to the said see of Durham and for making more convenient the avenue and passage leading on the same or to appropriate any building or ground which the said bishop is intitled unto in right of his see for the pur∣poses aforesaid  And forasmuch as the raising an adequate sum of money upon the credit of this act by granting annuities for lives will be a speedy and effectual method of carrying the intentions of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham into complete execution be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid that it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons to contribute advance and pay to such treasurer or treasurers as the said John Lord Bishop of Durham or his successors shall in manner herein∣after mentioned authorise and impower to receive the same for the uses hereinafter expressed any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole the sum of twelve thousand pounds for the absolute purchase of twelve or more annuities for lives to be paid and payable and the same are hereby directed to continue and be paid during the full term of the natural life of each such contributor respectively or the natural life of such other person as shall be nominated by or on the behalf of each contributor respectively at the time of payment of their respective purchase or contributionmoney which an∣nuity or annuities shall not respectively exceed the rate of ten pounds per annum for every one hundred pounds advanced and actually paid and so in proportion for any greater or less sum so to be advanced and paid as aforesaid and the said several an∣nuities so to be purchased shall be charged upon and be paid and payable out of the rents revenues and profits of the said see which from time to time during the con∣tinuance of the said annuities or any of them shall be received by the said John  Lord Bishop of Durham or his successors or shall come to the hands of or be re∣ceived by the receivergeneral for the time being of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham or his successors by such receivergeneral or his successors at such place in the city of Durham by equal halfyearly payments as in the order or orders hereinafter mentioned for payment thereof shall be respectively expressed and such receivergeneral for the time being shall be credited or have an allowance in his accounts of or for all such sums of money as he shall actually pay by virtue or in pursuance of this act as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if such payments had respectively been really and  bonâ fide  made to the said John Lord Bishop of Durham or his suc∣cessors and the said several annuities shall commence from the receipt of any sum or sums of money respectively and such annuity or annuities shall not be subject or liable to any deduction or abatement for or in respect of any tax charge or assessment im∣posed or to be imposed by authority of parliament or otherwise howsoever upon the lands tenements or persons by this act charged therewith or by whom or out of which the same are to be answered and

good any loss that shall or may happen in or of any such purchase or considerationmoney that shall be so advanced or paid as aforesaid or any part thereof and the receipt or receipts of the said several annuitants their respective executors administrators or assigns for all and every such sum and sums of money as shall be paid to them or any of them respectively by the said receivergeneral for the time being in pursuance of this act shall be as good and effectual discharges to such receivergeneral as if the same sum and sums had been actually paid to the said John Lord Bishop of Durham or his suc∣cessors  Provided always and it is hereby further enacted and declared that previous to the sale of such annuities in order to raise the said sum of twelve thousand pounds or any part thereof one calendar month's notice at the least shall four or more different days be given in the London Gazette expressing the intention of the sale of such an∣nuity or annuities so as to raise the said sum of twelve thousand pounds or any part thereof in order that any person may have an opportunity to deliver in proposals for what annual income or payment  per centum  they are willing to advance their money and the said trustees or any three or more of them shall if the said Lord Bishop of Durham or his successors shall think any such proposals reasonable give the pre∣ference to the lowest proposer regard being had to the circumstances of age and health and the said annuities shall be sold by the said trustees or any three or more of them subject to the approbation of the said Lord Bishop of Durham to be signified by any writing under his hand to the best advantage they can  And for the more effectual securing to the said annuitants the regular and full pay∣ment of their

part thereof respectively shall be behind and unpaid for twentyone days after any of the feasts or days which shall be limited and appointed for pay∣ment thereof then and so often and from time to time as it shall so happen it shall and may be lawful to and for the said annuitants or persons intitled to such annuities respectively and his and their respective executors administrators and

the said mayor aldermen and common council all such sums as by them should be laid out for the purposes in the said act mentioned over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds it should be lawful for them to take certain tolls for passage over the said temporary bridge and whereas it was apprehended at the time of passing the said act that a new stone bridge might be built or the old stone bridge effectually repaired in less time than seven years from the said twentyfourth day of June but it having since been sound necessary to take down four arches of that part of the said bridge which belongs to the said cor∣poration which at the time of passing the said act were deemed sit to be left standing the building of the new stone bridge has been retarded and the same cannot be com∣pleted in less than three years from this time and whereas when the old stone bridge was destroyed by a flood as before mentioned there were standing on that part thereof which belongs to the corporation of Newcastle divers houses shops and other build∣ings which greatly incommoded the passage along the said bridge all which have been purchased by the said corporation at a very considerable expence in order to prevent the publick being incommoded thereby and whereas the Lord Bishop of Durham and the said corporation have respectively proceeded to build a new stone bridge in the place where the old bridge stood and the said corporation had on the twentyninth day of December one thousand seven hundred and seventyeight expended of their own proper money in building their part of the same the sum of twentyone thousand and fortytwo pounds sixteen shillings and elevenpence including one thousand eight hundred and thirtyeight pounds nine shillings and eightpence the price of the buildings on the old bridge and have since that time incurred further expences in carrying on the same and whereas upon a moderate computation the said corporation must expend the further sum of ten thousand pounds in completing that part of the said bridge which belongs to them and whereas the said corporation had expended on the said twentyninth day of December one thousand seven hundred and seventyeight over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds in and about the purposes of the said recited act for building a temporary bridge the sum of three hundred and twentyone pounds eighteen shillings and ninepence more than the tolls taken upon the said temporary bridge had produced and it is apprehended that the tolls taken and to be taken thereupon from the twentyseventh day of December one thousand seven hundred and seventy eight to the twentyfourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventynine and not produce so much money a will be sufficient to reimburse the said corporation the said sum of three hundred and twentyone pounds eighteen shillings and ninepence and the necessary expences of repair∣ing preserving and supporting the said temporary bridge to the said twentyfourth day of June and whereas the said temporary bridge is liable to great damage from floods and ice in the river and also from keels loaded with coals passing through the same and it will be of publick utility that the same temporary bridge should be sup∣ported till the said new stone bridge shall be built and whereas at the time the said bridge was destroyed by a flood there were standing on that part thereof which belong to the see of Durham divers houses shops and other buildings which greatly incom∣moded  the passage over the same and whereas the avenue and passage to the said new bridge at both ends thereof are the same as were to the old bridge and are very nar∣row and it would be of publick utility to open more convenient avenues and passages thereto and also if the see of Durham was restrained from erecting or permitting to be erected any houses shops or other buildings on that part of the said newbridge which belongs to the said see may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parlia∣ment assembled and by the authority of the same that from and after the twentyfourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventynine Sir Lancelot Allgood James

twelfth and nineteenth years of his present Majesty's reign made for building a temporary bridge and completing a new stone bridge over the river Tyne between the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gates∣head in the county of Durham and making the avenues to and the passages over the same more commodious and for removing and preventing nuisances and annoyances in the streets lanes or avenues leading to the said new stone bridge within the town of Gateshead in the county of Durham  WHEREAS an act of parliament passed in the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign for building a temporary bridge over the river Tyne between the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in the county of Durham which temporary bridge was to have continuance from the twentyfourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventytwo for the term of seven years and in the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign another act of parliament passed whereby the said tempo∣rary bridge was continued for the further term of three years and divers persons therein named were appointed trustees for putting the said lastmentioned act into execution and were enabled to complete the new stone bridge over the said river and to make the avenues to and the passage over the said new stone bridge more commodious and it was thereby enacted that for and towards raising money for the purposes of the said act it should be lawful for the said trustees to take and receive such and the same tolls for the passage of cattle carriages and other things over the said new stone bridge as by the said firstmentioned act were authorized to be taken on the said temporary bridge until the expiration of twelve years to be computed from the twentyfourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventynine or until such sooner time as the several purposes of the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign should be carried into execution and the money borrowed upon the credit thereof with interest should be repayed and it was provided and declared by the said lastmentioned act that the improvement of the avenues to the said new stone bridge should end at the messuages and premises then late Oliphant's at the south abutment of the said new stone bridge  And whereas the said trustees have duly put the said act in execution and have by the money arising from the said tolls and borrowed on the credit thereof made and opened such avenues and completed such other works within the limits prescribed by the said lastmentioned act as were adjudged necessary for the safety and accommodation of the public but the south avenue to the said new stone bridge beyond the premises late Oliphant's in the town of Gateshead aforesaid is inconvenient and dangerous to passen∣gers by reason of the great declivity of the street there called the Bottlebank over which the high road leading from the city of Durham to the said bridge lies though the same is capable of being rendered both safe and commodious  And whereas it will be of great public utility to effect the improvement of the said south avenue to the said bridge but in regard that the said trustees appointed by the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign are thereby restrained from making any improvement beyond the said premises late Oliphant's and such intended improvements of the said south avenue cannot be effectually made unless the said tolls are further continued and the terms and powers of both the said acts enlarged May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and  temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same that the term of twelve years granted by the said lastmentioned act shall be and the same is hereby declared to be enlarged and continued for the further term of twelve years to be reckoned and computed from the expiration of the said term of twelve years  And in order that the several powers and authorities necessary to be exercised in effect∣ing the several purposes herein mentioned may be the better understood and more easily executed be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that instead of the several clauses provisions powers tolls

and from and after the expiration thereof for and during the further term of twelve years for the purpose of improving the said south avenue to the said new stone bridge according to the true intent and meaning of this act  And in order to secure the money now due and owing on the credit of the said for∣mer acts or either of them be it further enacted and declared by the authority afore∣said that from and after the passing of this act this act and the several tolls hereinafter granted and made payable shall for and during the residue of the said term of twelve years already granted as aforesaid and also for and during the said additional term of twelve years hereby granted and continued be and remain subject and liable to the payment of all sums of money which at the time of passing this act shall be due and owing on the credit of the said former acts or either of them and to the payment of all sums of mo∣ney which shall or may hereafter be borrowed on the credit of this present act together with all interest then due and which shall or may from time to time hereafter become due and payable for the same respectively  And in order to carry the purposes of this act into

Catherinae  p  Hinc atque hinc extat vetus urbs olim inclyta bello  Et muri disjecti et propugnacula lapsa  Ibid  p  Draiton in the th song of his Polyolbion thus introduces a poetical description of the Roman Wall  "But PictsWall all this while as though he had been lost  Not mentioned by the muse began to fret and fume  That ev'ry petty brooke thus proudly should presume  To talke and he whom first the Romans did invent  And of their greatnesse yet the long'stliv'd monument  Should thus be overtrod wherefore his wrong to wreake  In their proud presence thus doth aged PictsWall speake  He thinks that Offa's ditch in Cambria should not dare  To think himself my match who with such cost and care  The Romans did erect and for my safeguard set  Their legions from my spoyle the proling Pict to let  That often inroads made our earth from them to win  By Adrian beaten back so he to keepe them in  To sea from east to west begun me first a wall  Of eighty miles in length 'twixt Tyne and Eden's fall  Long making me they were and long did me maintaine  Nor yet that trench which tracts the western Wiltshire plaine  Of Woden Wansdyke call'd should paralell with me  Comparing our descents which shall appeare to be  Mere upstarts basely borne for when I was in hand  The Saxon had not then set foot upon the land  Till my declining age and after many a yeare  Of whose poore petty Kings those the small labours were  That on Newmarket Heath made up as though but now  Who for the Devil's worke the vulgar dare avow  Tradition telling none who truly it began  Where many a reverent booke can tell you of my man  And when I first decayed Severus going on  What Adrian built of turfe he builded new of stone  And after many a time the Britans me repayr'd  To keepe me still in plight nor cost they ever spar'd  Townes stood upon my length where garrisons were laid  Their limits to defend and for my greater aid  With turrets I was built where sentinels were plac'd  To watch upon the Pict so me my makers grac'd  With hollow pipes of brasse along me still they went  By which they in one fort still to another sent  By speaking in the same to tell them what to doe  And soe from sea to sea could I be whispered through  Upon my thicknesse three march'd eas'ly breast to breast  Twelve foot was I in height such glory I possest  Old PictsWall with much pride thus finishing his plea  Had in his utmost course attained the eastern sea"  During my residence at Newcastle upon Tyne prompted by an ardour of curiosity bordering on enthusiasm I occasionally made several excursions to examine the still re∣maining vestiges of those stupendous works raised here by a people who were justly styled the conquerors of the world for the great purpose of protecting in their posses∣sions  their civilized subjects and to ward off the attacks of the more northern and un∣conquered barbarians  Agricola appears to have suggested the first idea of building these by erecting A D  See Horsley's Britannia Romana  a row of sorts across the island from Tinmouth  The late discovery of a Roman altar and tablet in the foundations of the ancient Christian church there seems clearly to evince that Tinmouth has been one of their stationsSee vol ii p of this work And ibid p that there has been anoth  r at East Chirton called "Blake Chestres" in the year  It is still however certain that neith  r of the walls extended as far as Tinmouth Hadrian's having terminated at Newcastle upon Tyne and that of Severu  at the old village of Wall's End about three miles to the east of Newcastle  on the German Ocean to the Irish Sea  To connect these the emperor Hadrian  That Hadrian was the first that built  a wal  here we have the express testimony of a Roman historian in the following words "Britanniam petrit in qua multa correxit  m  ru  que per o toginta millia passuum    qui barbaros Romanosque divideret"Spartiani Vita Hadriani Script Hist August p  Hadrian's  Vallum  as it is also called appears to have been a  turf  wall with a deep foss or ditch accompa∣nying it on the north side There was another called by Horsley the South Agger at the distance of about five paces to the south of it as also another and larger agger on the north side of the ditch which the same writer supposes to have been the military way to this work as it had been before to the pretentura of stations These four works it is very observable keep all the way a constant regular parallelism one to another The same writer acknowledges that there is no determining with certainty what was the ori∣ginal height of this mud wall and its aggers of which he conjectures the southern one to have been for an inner defence in case they should be beaten from the principal work or to protect the soldiers against any sudden attack from the provincial BritonsSee Britannia Romana p  Though  arus  and  vallum  are sometimes promiscuously used yet vallum rather signifies an agger of earth in which sense it plainly occurs in Caesar's Comm  in the following passage  "Valio pedum et fossa pedum hiberna cin runt"De B  lio Gallico lib v c  first in the year and afterwards Severus  Severus' Wall built of square stones and every where ex  p  on the edges of precipices accompanied by a deep ditch or foss was according to Bede who mur  hav  en it in perfection eight feet in breadth and twelve in heightThe breadth of it appears to vary a little in several places of the present remain It is no where preserved in its original height  To this work belongs a paved military way which every where has attended this w  ll on the south side though not alw  ys parallel to it for in so  e plac  s it m  kes a short  ble the s  ing to a bow  Mr Hor  y  pposed too that there was a smaller military way  the wall for the convenience of parties of soldier  ing from one turret to another There was no north agger though the earth thrown out of the ditch form  in different places something like a  lacis  Upon this wall which generally runs on the top or ri  of the higher ground both keeping a des  o  the north or enemies' side and having thereby a greater strength and a better prospect

Roman seges corn and the British dunum a hill i e the fort or station on a high ground furnished with magazines of corn brought by sea from the more southern provinces and landed here" is I think erroneous for seges signifies cornland soil where corn grows May not the first syllable be derived with greater probability from sedge a narrow flag so called i e the hill of sedge    SEGEDUNUM where the Notitia stations the first cohort of the Lergi is supposed to have stood at a small distance from the present  An old woman still living remembers when the site of the present Wall's End was an empty field  village of Wall's End and a little to the east of a gentleman's seat house called at present Carville but in Horsley's time Cousin's House in two fields or closes known by the name of  WellLawes  perhaps by corruption for  WallLawes  The fire engines and workings of a new colliery adjoin∣ing to Segedunum  The area of this station is described by Horsley as having been on a plain "the south rampart has run along the brow of the hill or at the head of the descent towards the r  ver and the outbuildings or town as appears by the hillocks of stones and rubbish has stood upon the descent open to the southern sun and reached to the side of the river All which is exactly agreeable to the rules the Romans seem to have almost inviolably observed in building their stations"Britan Rom p  I have in my possession the original stones found here and marked No and in Horsley's Britannia Romana Northumberland What that writer calls F  AR on one of them is plainly FLOR for Florus a

have had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the Creed was lately inclosed by Mr Coulson for a bathing place which was no sooner done than the water left it This occasioned strange whispers in the village and the adjacent places The well was always esteemed of more sanctity than common wells and therefore the failing of the water could be looked upon as nothing less than a just
