 NATURE AND ART  BY MRS INCHBALD  THE SECOND EDITION  DUBLIN  Printed by William Porter  FOR P WOGAN P BYRNE J MILLIKEN J RICE W JONES J MOORE H COLBERT AND G FOLINGSBY    NATURE AND ART  CHAPTER I  AT a time when the nobility of Britain were said by the Poet Laureat to admire and protect the arts and were known by the whole nation to be the patrons of musicWilliam and Henry youths under twenty years of age brothers and the sons of a country shopkeeper who had lately died insolvent set out on foot for London in the hope of procuring by their industry a scanty subsistence  As they walked out of their native town each with a small bundle at his back each observed the other drop several tears but upon the sudden meeting of their eyes they both smiled with a degree of disdain at the weakness in which they had been caught  "I am sure" said William the elder "I don't know why I cry"  "Nor I neither" said Henry "for though we may never see this town again yet we leave nothing behind us to give us cause to lament"  "No" replied William "nor any body who cares what becomes of us"  "But I was thinking" said Henry now weeping bitterly "that if my poor father were alive  he  would care what was to become of ushe would not have suffered us to begin this long journey without a few shillings more in our pockets"  At the end of this sentence William who had with some effort suppressed his tears while his brother spoke now uttered with a voice almost inarticulate"Don't say any more don't talk any more about it My father used to tell us that when he was gone we must take care of ourselves and so we must I only wish" continued he giving way to his grief "that I had never done any thing to offend him while he was living"  "That is what I wish too" cried Henry "If I had always been dutiful  to him while he was alive I would not shed one tear for him now that he is gone but I would thank heaven that he had escaped from his creditors"  In conversation such as this wherein their sorrow for their deceased parent seemed less for his death than because he had not been so happy when living as they ought to have made him and wherein their own outcast fortune was less the subject of their grief than the reflection "what their father would have endured could he have beheld them in their present situation" in conversation such as this they pursued their journey till they arrived at that metropolis which has received for centuries past from the provincial towns the bold adventurer of every denomination has stampt his character with experience and example and while it has bestowed on some coronets and mitreson some the lasting fame of geniusto others has dealt beggary infamy and untimely death  CHAPTER II  AFTER a trial of three weeks passed in London a year followed during which William and Henry never sat down to a dinner or went into a bed without hearts glowing with thankfulness to that providence which had bestowed on them such unexpected blessings for no longer did they presume to expect what still they presumed they deserved a secure pittance for themselves in this world of plenty Their experience since they came to town had informed them that to obtain a permanent livelihood is the good fortune but of a part of those who are in want of it and the precarious earning of half a crown or a shilling in the neighbourhood where they lodged by an errand or some such accidental means was the sole support which they at present enjoyed  They had sought for constant employment of various kinds and even for servants'  places but obstacles had always occurred to prevent their success If they applied for the situation of a clerk to a man of extensive concerns their qualifications were admitted but there must be security given for their fidelity they had friends who would give them a character but who would give them nothing else  If they endeavoured for the place even of a menial servant they were too clownish and awkward for the presence of the lady of the houseand once when William who had been educated at the free grammarschool of the town in which he was born and was an excellent scholar hoping to obtain the good opinion of a young clergyman whom he solicited for the favour of waiting upon him acquainted him "That he understood Greek and Latin" he was rejected by the divine "because he could not dress hair"  Weary of repeating their mean accomplishments of "honesty sobriety humility" and on the precipice of reprobating such qualitieswhich however  beneficial to the soul gave no hope of preservation to the bodythey were prevented from this profanation by the fortunate remembrance of one qualification which Henry the possessor in all his distress had never till then called to his recollection but which being once remembered and made known changed the whole prospect of wretchedness placed before the two brothers and they never knew want more  Reader not to keep you in suspense concerning this attributeHenry could play upon the fiddle  CHAPTER III  NO sooner was it publicly known that Henry could play most excellently upon the violin than he was invited into many companies where no other accomplishment could have introduced him His performance was so much admired that he had the honour of being admitted to several tavern feasts of which he had also the honour to partake without partaking of the expence He was soon addressed by persons of the very first rank and fashion and was once seen walking side by side with a peer  But yet in the midst of this powerful occasion for rejoicing Henry whose heart was particularly affectionate had one grief that eclipsed all the happiness of his new lifehis brother William could  not  play on the fiddleconsequently his brother William with whom he had shared so much ill could not share in his good fortune  One evening Henry coming home from a dinner and concert at the Crown and Anchor found William in a very gloomy and peevish humour poring over  De Oratore  of Cicero Henry asked him several times "How he did" and similar questions marks of his kind disposition towards his beloved brother but all his endeavours he perceived could not soothe or soften the sullen mind of William At length taking from his pocket a handful of almonds and some delicious fruit which he had purloined from the plenteous table where his brother's wants had never been absent from his thoughts and laying them down before him he exclaimed with a benevolent smile "Do William let me teach you to play upon the violin"  Williamfull of the great orator whom he was then studying and still more alive to the impossibility that  his  ear attuned only to sense could ever descend from that elevation to learn mere  undsWilliam caught up the tempting presents which Henry had ventured his reputation to obtain for him and threw them all indignantly at the donor's head  Henry felt too powerfully his own superiority of fortune to resent this ingratitude he only picked up the repast and laying it again upon the table placed by its side a bottle of claret which he held fast by the neck while he assured his brother that "although he had taken it while the waiter's back was turned yet it might be drank with a safe conscience by them for he had not himself tasted one drop at the feast on purpose that he might enjoy a glass with his brother at home and without wronging the company who had invited him"  The affection Henry expressed as he said thisor the force of a bumper of wine which William had not seen since he left his father's househad such an effect in calming the displeasure he was cherishing that on his brother's offering him the glass he took it and he deigned even to eat of his present  Henry to convince him that he had stinted himself to obtain for him this collation sat down and partook of it  After a few glasses had passed he again ventured to say "Do brother William let me teach you to play on the violin"  Again his offer was refused but though with less vehemence at length they both agreed the attempt could not prosper  "Then" said Henry "William go down to Oxford or to Cambridge There no doubt they are as fond of learning as in this gay town they are of music You know you have as much talent for the one as I for the other do go to one of our universities and see what dinners what suppers and what friends  you  will find there"  CHAPTER IV  WILLIAM  did  go to one of those seats of learning and would have starved there but for the affectionate remittances of Henry who shortly became so great a proficient in the art of music as to have it in his power not only to live in a very reputable manner himself but to send such supplies to his brother as to enable him to pursue his studies  With some the progress of fortune is rapid Such is the case when either on merit or demerit great patronage is bestowed Henry's violin had often charmed to a welcome forgetfulness of his insignificance an effeminate lord or warmed with ideas of honour the head of a duke whose heart could never be taught to feel its manly glow Princes had flown to the arms of their favourite fairones with more rapturous delight softened by the masterly touches of his art and those elevated personages evergrateful to those  from whom they derive benefits were competitors in the desire of heaping favours upon him But he in all his advantages never once lost from his thoughts the hope of some advantage for his brother William and when at any time he was pressed by a patron to demand a "token of his regard" he would constantly reply  "I have a brother a very learned man if your lordship your grace or your royal highness would confer some small favour on him"  His lordship would reply "He was so teazed and harassed in his youth by learned men that he had ever since detested the whole fraternity"  His grace would inquire "If the learned man could play upon any instrument"  And his highness would ask "If he could sing"  Rebuffs such as these poor Henry met with in all his applications for William till one fortunate evening at the conclusion of a concert a great man shook him by the hand and promised a living of five hundred a year the incumbent of  which was upon his deathbed to his brother in return for the entertainment Henry had just given him  Henry wrote in haste to William and began his letter thus "My dear brother I am not sorry you did not learn to play upon the fiddle"  CHAPTER V  THE incumbent of this living diedWilliam was ordained and in a few weeks came to town to take possession of the gift which his brother's skill had acquired him  William had a steady countenance a stern brow and a majestic walk all of which this new accession this holy calling to religious vows rather increased than diminished In the early part of his life the violin of his brother had rather irritated than soothed the morose disposition of his nature and though since their departure from their native habitation it had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his hunger it had never been successful in appeasing the disturbed passions of a proud and a disdainful mind  As the painter views with delight and wonder the finished picture expressive testimony of his taste and genius as the physician beholds with pride and gladness  the recovering invalid whom his art has snatched from the jaws of death as the father gazes with rapture on his first child the creature to whom he has given lifeso did Henry survey with transporting glory his brother drest for the first time in his canonicals to preach at his parish church He viewed him from head to footsmiledviewed againpulled one side of his gown a little this way one end of his band a little that waythen stole behind him pretending to place the curls of his hair but in reality to indulge and to conceal tears of fraternal pride and joy  William was not without joy neither was he wanting in love or gratitude to his brotherbut his pride was not completely satisfied  "I am eldest brother" he thought to himself "and a man of literature and yet am I obliged to my younger an illiterate man"Here he suppressed every thought that could be a reproach to that brother But there remained an object of his former contempt now become even detestable to himungrateful man  the very agent of his elevation was now so odious to him that he could not cast his eyes upon the friendly violin without instant emotions of disgust  In vain would Henry at times endeavour to subdue his haughtiness by a tune on this wonderful machine"You know I have no ear" William would sternly say in recompense for one of Henry's best solo's Yet was William enraged at Henry's answer when after taking him to hear him preach he asked him "how he liked his sermon" and Henry replied merely with pleasantry and in the technical phrase of his profession "You know brother I have no ear"  Henry's renown in his profession daily increased and with his fame his friends Possessing the virtues of humility and charity far above William the profest teacher of those virtues his reverend brother's disrespect for his vocation never once made him relax for a moment in his anxiety to advance him in  his  Within a year or two he had the gratification of presenting him to a deanery and at once placed between them an insurmountable  barrier to all friendship that was not the effect of condescension on the part of the dean  William would now begin seriously to remonstrate with his brother "upon his useless occupation" and would intimate "the degradation it was to him to hear his frivolous talent spoken of in all companies" Henry believed his brother much wiser than himself and suffered shame that he was not more worthy of such a relation To console himself for the familiar friend whom he now perceived he had entirely lost he searched for one of a softer naturehe married  CHAPTER VI  AS Henry despaired of receiving his brother's approbation of his choice he never mentioned the event to him but William being told of it by a third person inquired of Henry who confirmed the truth of the intelligence and acknowledged that in taking a wife his sole view had been to obtain a kind companion and friend who would bear with his failings and know how to esteem his few qualifications therefore he had chosen one of his own rank in life and who having a taste for music and as well as himself an obligation to the art  "And is it possible" cried the dean "that what has been hinted to me is true Is it possible that you have married a public finger"  "She is as good as myself" returned Henry "I did not wish her to be better for fear she should despise me"  "As to despise" answered the dean "heaven forbid that we should despise  any onethat would be acting unlike a christianbut do you imagine I can ever introduce her to my intended wife who is a woman of family"  Henry had received in his life many insults from his brother but as he was not a vain man he generally thought his brother in the right and consequently submitted with patiencebut though he had little selflove he had for his wife an unbounded affection on the present occasion therefore he began to raise his voice and even in the coarse expression of clownish anger to lift his handbut the sudden and affecting recollection of what he had done for the deanof the pains the toils the hopes and the fears he had experienced when soliciting his prefermentthis recollection overpowered his speechweakened his armand deprived him of every active force but that of flying out of the dean's house in which they then were as swift as lightning while the dean sat proudly contemplating"that he had done his duty"  For several days Henry did not call as was his custom to see his brother William's  marriage drew near and he sent a formal card to invite him on that day but not having had the condescension to name his sisterinlaw in the invitation Henry took no notice of it and the joyful event was celebrated without his presence But the ardour of the bridegroom was not so vehement as to overcome every other sensationhe missed his brotherthat heartfelt cheerfulness with which Henry had ever given him joy upon every happy occasioneven amidst all the politer congratulations of his other friendsseemed to the dean mournfully wanting This derogation from his felicity he was resolved to resentand for a whole year these brothers whom adversity had entwined closely together prosperity separated  Though Henry on his marriage paid so much attention to his brother's prejudices as to take his wife from her public employment this had not so entirely removed the scruples of William as to permit him to think her a worthy companion for Lady Clementina the daughter of a poor Scotch earl whom he had chosen  merely that he might be proud of her family though in return he should suffer that family to be ashamed of  his  If Henry's wife was not fit company for Lady Clementina it is to be hoped she was company for angelsshe died within the first year of her marriage a faithful an affectionate wife and a mother  When William heard of her death he felt a sudden shockand a kind of fleeting thought glanced across his mind that  "Had he known she had been so near her dissolution she might have been introduced to Lady Clementina and he himself would have called her sister"  That is if he had defined his fleeting idea "they would have had no objection to have met this poor woman for the  last time  and would have descended to the familiarity of kindred in order to have wished her a good journey to the other world"  Or is there in death something that so raises the abjectness of the poor that on their approach to its sheltering abode the arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied and trembles  CHAPTER VII  THE wife of Henry had been dead near six weeks before the dean heard the news a month then elapsed in thoughts by himself and consultations with Lady Clementina how he should conduct himself on this occurrence Her advice was  "That as Henry was the youngest and by their stations in every sense the dean's inferior he ought first to make overtures of reconciliation"  The dean answered "He had no doubt of his brother's good will to him but that he had reason to think from the knowledge of his temper he would be more likely to come to him upon an occasion to bestow comfort than to receive it for instance if I had suffered the misfortune of losing you my brother I have no doubt would have forgotten his resentment and"  She was offended that the loss of the vulgar wife of Henry should be compared to the loss of hershe lamented her  indiscretion in forming an alliance with a family of no rank and implored the dean to wait till his brother should make some concession to him before he renewed the acquaintance  Though Lady Clementina had mentioned on this occasion her  indiscretion  she was of a prudent ageshe was near fortyyet possessing rather a handsome face and person she would not have impressed the spectator with an idea that she was near so old had she not constantly attempted to appear much younger Her dress was fantastically fashionable her manners affected all the various passions of youth and her conversation was perpetually embellished with accusations upon her own "heedlessness thoughtlessness carelessness and childishness"  There is perhaps in every individual one parent motive to every action good or bad be that as it will it was evident that with Lady Clementina all she said or did all she thought or looked had but one foundationvanityIf she was nice or if she was negligent vanity was the cause of both for she would contemplate  with the highest degree of selfcomplacency "what such a one would say of her elegant preciseness or what such a one would think of her interesting neglect"  If she complained she was ill it was with the certainty that her languor would be admired if she boasted she was well it was that the spectator might admire her glowing health if she laughed it was because she thought it made her look pretty if she cried it was because she thought it made her look prettier still If she scolded her servants it was from vanity to show her superior knowledge to theirs and she was kind to them from the same vice that her benevolence might excite their admirationForward and impertinent in the company of her equals from the vanity of supposing herself above them she was bashful even to shamefacedness in the presence of her superiors because her vanity told her she engrossed all their observation Through vanity she had no memory for she constantly forgot every thing she heard others say from the minute attention which she paid to every thing she said herself  She had become an old maid from vanity believing no offer she received worthy of her deserts and when her power of farther conquest began to be doubted she married from vanity to repair the character of her fading charms In a word her vanity was of that magnitude that she had no idea but that she was humble in her own opinion and it would have been impossible to have convinced her that she thought well of herself because she thought  so well  as to be assured that her own thoughts undervalued her  CHAPTER VIII  THAT which in a weak woman is called vanity in a man of sense is termed pridemake one a degree stronger or the other a degree weaker and the dean and his wife were infected with the selfsame folly Yet do not let the reader suppose that this failing however despicable had erased from either bosom all traces of humanity They are human creatures who are meant to be pourtrayed in this little book and where is the human creature who has not some good qualities to soften if not counterbalance his bad ones  The dean with all his pride could not wholly forget his brother nor eradicate from his remembrance the friend he had been to himhe resolved therefore in spite of his wife's advice to make him some overture which he had no doubt but Henry's good nature would instantly accept The more he became acquainted with all the vain and selfish propensities  of Lady Clementina the more he felt a returning affection for his brother but little did he suspect how much he loved him till after sending to various places to enquire for him he learntthat on his wife's decease unable to support her loss in the surrounding scene Henry had taken the child she brought him in his arms shaken hands with all his former friendspassing over his brother in the numberand set sail in a vessel bound for Africa with a party of Portuguese and some few English adventurers to people there the uninhabited part of an extensive island  This was a resolution in Henry's circumstances worthy a mind of singular sensibility but William had not discerned till then that every act of Henry's was of the same description and more than all his every act towards him He staggered when he heard the tidings at first thought them untrue but quickly recollected that Henry was capable of surprising deeds He recollected with a force that gave him torture the benevolence his brother had ever shown towards  himthe favours he had heaped upon himthe insults he had patiently endured in requital  In the first emotion which this intelligence gave the dean he forgot the dignity of his walk and gestureHe ran with frantic enthusiasm to every corner of his house where the least vestige of what belonged to Henry remainedHe pressed close to his breast with tender agony a coat of his which by accident had been left thereHe kissed and wept over a walkingstick which Henry once had given himHe even took up a musicbook of his brother's with delightnor would his poor violin had it been there have then excited anger  When his grief became more calm he sat in deep and melancholy meditation calling to mind when and where he saw his brother last The recollection gave him fresh cause of regret He remembered they had parted on his refusal to suffer Lady Clementina to admit the acquaintance of Henry's wifeBoth Henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond the reach of his pride and he felt the meanness of his triumph  To add to his selfreproaches he beheld in his tormented memory the countenance of his brother at their last interview as it changed while he censured his marriage and treated with disrespect the object of his conjugal affection He remembered the anger repressed the tear bursting forth and the last glimpse he had of him as he left his presence for ever  In vain he now wished that he had followed him to the doorthat he had once shaken hands and owned his obligations to him before they had parted In vain he wished too that in this extreme agony of his mind he had such a friend to comfort him as Henry had ever proved  CHAPTER IX  THE avocations of an elevated life erase the deepest impressionsthe dean in a few months recovered of those which his brother's departure first made upon him and would now at times even condemn in anger Henry's having so hastily abandoned him and his native country in resentment as he conceived of a few misfortunes which his usual fortitude should have taught him to bear Yet was he still desirous of his return and wrote two or three letters expressive of his wish which he anxiously endeavoured should reach him But many years elapsing without any intelligence from him and a report having arrived that he and all the party with whom he went were slain by the savage inhabitants of the island William's despair of seeing his brother again caused the desire to diminish while attention and affection to a still nearer and dearer relation than Henry ever was to him now chiefly engaged his mind  Lady Clementina had brought him a son on whom from his infancy he doatedand the boy in riper years possessing a handsome person and evincing a quickness of parts gratified the father's darling passion pride as well as the mother's vanity  The dean had besides this child a domestic comfort highly gratifying to his ambition the bishop of **** became intimately acquainted with him soon after his marriage and from his daily visits had become as it were a part of the family This was much honour to the dean not only as the bishop was his superior in the church but was of that part of the bench whose blood is ennobled by a race of ancestors and to which all wisdom on the plebeian side crouches in humble respect  Year after year rolled on in pride and grandeur the bishop and the dean passing their time in attending levees and in talking politics Lady Clementina passing hers in attending routs and in talking of  herself  till the son arrived at the age of thirteen  Young William passed  his  time from morning till night with persons who taught him to walk to ride to talk to think like a mana foolish man instead of a wise child as nature designed him to be  This unfortunate youth was never permitted to have one conception of his ownall was taught himhe was never once asked "what he thought" but men were paid to tell him "how to think" He was taught to revere such and such persons however unworthy of his reverence to believe such and such things however unworthy of his credit and to act so and so on such and such occasions however unworthy of his feelings  Such were the lessons of the tutors assigned him by his fatherThose masters whom his mother gave him did him less mischief for though they distorted his limbs and made his manners effeminate they did not interfere with the internal  Mr Norwynne the family name of his father and though but a schoolboy he was called  Mister  could talk on history on politics and on religion surprisingly to all who never listened to a parrot or a  magpiefor he merely repeated what he had heard without one reflection upon the sense or probability of his report He had been praised for his memory and to continue that praise he was so anxious to retain every sentence he had heard or he had read that the poor creature had no time for one native idea but only redelivered his tutors' lessons to his father and his father's to his tutors But whatever he said or did was the admiration of all who came to the house of the dean and who knew he was an only childIndeed considering the labour that was taken to spoil him he was rather a commendable youth for with the pedantic folly of his tutors the blind affection of his father and mother the obsequiousness of the servants and flattery of the visitors it was some credit to him that he was not an ideot or a bruteThough when he imitated the manners of a man he had something of the latter in his appearancefor he would grin and bow to a lady catch her fan in haste if it fell and hand her to her coach as thoroughly void of all the sentiment which gives grace to such tricks as a monkey  CHAPTER X  ONE morning in winter just as the dean his wife and darling child had finished their breakfast at their house in London a servant brought in a letter to his master and said "The man waited for an answer"  "Who is the man" cried the dean with all that terrifying dignity with which he never failed to address his inferiors especially such as waited on his person  The servant replied with a servility of tone equal to the haughty one of his master "he did not know but that the man looked like a sailor and had a boy with him"  "A begging letter no doubt" cried Lady Clementina  "Take it back" said the dean "and bid him send up word who he is or what is his errand"  The servant went and returning said "He comes from on board a ship his captain sent him and his errand is he  believes to leave a boy he has brought with him"  "A boy" cried the dean "what have I to do with a boy I expect no boy What boy What age"  "He looks about twelve or thirteen" replied the servant  "He is mistaken in the house" said the dean "Let me look at the letter again"  He did look at it and saw it was directed plainly to himselfUpon a second glance he had so perfect a recollection of the hand as to open it instantaneously and after ordering the servant to withdraw he read the following  ZOCOTORA ISLAND  April th  MY DEAR BROTHER WILLIAM  IT is a long time since we have seen one another but I hope not so long that you have quite forgotten the many happy days we once passed together  I did not take my leave of you when I left England because it would have been too much for meI had met with  a great many sorrows just at that time one of which was the misfortune of losing the use of my right hand by a fall from my horse which accident robbed me of most of my friends for I could no longer entertain them with my performance as I used to do and so I was ashamed to see them or you and that was the reason I came hither to try my fortune with some other adventurers  You have I suppose heard how the savages of the island put our whole party to death except myself I was heartbroken for my comrades but yet upon the whole I do not know that the savages were much to blamewe had no business to invade their territories and if they had invaded England we should have done the same by themMy life was spared because having gained some little strength in my hand during the voyage I pleased their king when I arrived there with playing on my violin  They spared my child too in pity to my lamentations when they were going  to put him to deathNow dear brother before I say any more concerning my child to you I will first ask your pardon for any offence I may have ever given you in all the time we lived so long togetherI know you have often found fault with me and I dare say I have been to blame very often but I here solemnly declare that I never did any thing purposely to offend you but mostly all I could to oblige youand I can safely declare that I never bore you above a quarter of an hour's resentment for any thing you might say to me which I thought harsh  Now dear William after being in this island eleven years the weakness in my hand has unfortunately returned and yet there being no appearance of complaint the uninformed islanders think it is all my obstinacy and that I  will not  entertain them with my music which makes me say that I  cannot  and they have imprisoned me and threaten to put my son to death if I persist in my stubbornness any longer  The anguish I feel in my mind takes away all hope of the recovery of strength  in my hand and I have no doubt but that they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into execution  Therefore dear brother William hearing from my prison of a most uncommon circumstance which is that an English vessel is lying at a small distance from the island I have entrusted a faithful negro to take my child to the ship and deliver him to the captain with a request that he may be sent with this letter to you on the ship's arrival in England  Now my dear dear brother William in case the poor boy should live to come to you I have no doubt but you will receive him yet excuse a poor fond father if I say a word or two that I hope may prove in his favour  Pray my dear brother do not think it the child's fault but mine that you will find him so ignoranthe has always shown a quickness and a willingness to learn and would I dare say if he had been brought up under your care have been by this time a Greek  scholarbut you know I am no scholar myself Besides not having any books here I have only been able to teach my child by talking to him and in all my conversations with him I have never taken much pains to instruct him in the manners of my own country thinking that if ever he went over he would learn them soon enough and if he never  did  go over that it would be as well he knew nothing about them  I have kept him also from the knowledge of every thing which I have thought pernicious in the conduct of the savages except now and then pointing out a few of their faults in order to give him a true conception and a proper distaste of them At the same time I have taught him to love and to do good to his neighbour whoever that neighbour might be and whatever might be his failings Falsehood of every kind I included in this precept as forbidden for no one can love his neighbour and deceive him  I have instructed him too to hold in contempt all frivolous vanity and  all kinds of indulgences which he was never likely to obtain He has learnt all I have undertaken to teach him but I am afraid you will yet think he has learnt too little  Your wife I fear will be offended at his want of politeness and perhaps want of proper respect for a person of her rank but indeed he is very tractable and can without severity be cured of all his faults and though you will find he has many yet pray my dear brother pray my dear brother William call to mind he has been a dutiful and an affectionate child to me and that had it pleased heaven we had lived together for many years to come I verily believe that I should never have experienced one mark of his disobedience  Farewel for ever my dear dear brother Williamand if my poor kind affectionate child should live to bring you this letter sometimes speak to him of me and let him know that for twelve years he was my sole comfort and that when I sent him from me in  order to save his life I laid down my head upon the floor of the cell in which I was confined and prayed that heaven might end my days before the morning  This was the conclusion of the letter except four or five lines which with his name were so much blotted apparently with tears that they were illegible  CHAPTER XI  WHILE the dean was reading to himself this letter his countenance frequently changed and once or twice the tears streamed from his eyes When it was finished he exclaimed  "My brother has sent his child to me and I will be a parent to him" He was going towards the door when Lady Clementina stopped him  "Is it proper do you think dean that all the servants in the house should be witnesses to your meeting with your brother and your nephew in the state in which they must be at present send for them into a private apartment"  "My brother" cried the dean "Oh that it  were  my brother The man is merely a person from the ship who has conducted his child hither"  The bell was rung money was sent to the man and orders given that the boy should be shown up immediately  While young Henry was walking up the stairs the dean's wife was weighing  in her mind in what manner it would most redound to her honour to receive him for her vanity taught her to believe that the whole inquisitive world pried into her conduct even upon every family occurrence  Young William was wondering to himself what kind of an unpolished monster his beggarly cousin would appear and was contemplating "how much the poor youth would be surprised and awed by his superiority"  The dean felt no other sensation than an impatient desire of beholding the child  The door openedand the son of his brother Henry of his benefactor entered  The habit he had on when he left his father being worn out by the length of the voyage he was in the dress of a sailorboy Though about the same age with his cousin he was something taller and though a strong family resemblance appeared between the two youths he was handsomer than William and from a simplicity spread over his countenance a quick impatience in his eye which denoted  anxious curiosity and childish surprise at every new object which presented itself he appeared younger than his informed and wellbred cousin  He walked into the room not with a dictated obeisance but with a hurrying step a half pleased yet a half frightened look an instantaneous survey of every person present not as demanding "what they thought of him" but expressing almost as plainly as in direct words "what he thought of them" For all alarm in respect to his safety and reception seemed now wholly forgotten in the curiosity which the sudden fight of strangers such as he had never seen in his life before excited And as to  himself  he did not appear to know there was such a person existing his whole faculties were absorbed in  others  The dean's reception of him did honour to his sensibility and his gratitude to his brotherAfter the first affectionate gaze he ran to him took him in his arms sat down drew him to him held him between his knees and repeatedly exclaimed "I will repay to you all I owe to your father"  The boy in return hugged the dean round the neck kissed him and cried  "Oh you  are  my fatheryou have just such eyes and such a foreheadindeed you would be almost the same as he if it were not for that great white thing which grows upon your head"  Let the reader understand that the dean fondly attached to every ornament of his dignified function was never seen unless caught in bed without an enormous wigwith this young Henry was enormously struck having never seen so unbecoming a decoration either in the savage island from whence he came or on board of the vessel in which he sailed  "Do you imagine" cried his uncle laying his hand gently on the reverend habiliment "that this grows"  "What is on  my  head grows" said young Henry "and so does what is upon my father's"  "But now you are come to Europe you will see many persons with such things as these which they put on and take off"  "Why do you wear such things"  "As a distinction between us and inferior people they are worn to give an importance to the wearer"  "That is just as the savages do they stick brass nails wire buttons and entrails of beasts all over them to give them importance"  The dean now led his nephew to Lady Clementina and told him "That was his aunt to whom he must behave with the utmost respect"  "I will I will" he replied "for she I see is a person of importance tooshe has very near such a white thing upon her head as you have"  His aunt had not yet fixed in what manner it was best to behave whether with intimidating grandeur or with amiable tenderness While she was hesitating between the two she felt a kind of jealous apprehension that her son was not so engaging either in his person or address as his cousin and therefore she said  "I hope dean the arrival of this child will give you a still higher sense of the happiness we enjoy in our ownwhat  an instructive contrast between the manners of the one and of the other"  "It is not the child's fault" returned the dean "that he is not so elegant in his manners as his cousinhad William been bred in the same place he would have been as unpolished as this boy"  "I beg your pardon sir" said young William with a formal bow and a sarcastic smile "for I assure you that several of my tutors have told me that I appear to know many things by instinct"  Young Henry fixed his eyes upon his cousin while with steady selfcomplacency he delivered this speech and no sooner was it concluded than Henry cried out  n a kind of wonder  "A little man as I am alive a little man I did not know there were such  ittle men in this country I never saw one in my life before"  "This is a boy" said the dean "a boy not older than yourself"  He put their hands together and William gravely shook hands with his cousin  "It  is  a man" continued young Henrythen stroked his cousin's chin No no  do not know whether it is or not"  "I tell you again" said the dean he is a boy of your own ageyou and he are cousins for I am his father"  "How can that be" said young Henry "he called you  Sir  "  "In this country" said the dean polite children do not call their parents  father  and  mother  "  "Then don't they sometimes forget to love them as such" asked Henry  His uncle became now impatient to interrogate him in every particular concerning his father's stateLady Clementina felt equal impatience to know where the father was whether he was coming to live with them wanted any thing of them and every circumstance in which her vanity was interested Explanations followed all these questions but which merely agreeing with what the elder Henry's letter has related require n  recital here  CHAPTER XII  THAT vanity which presided over every thought and deed of Lady Clementina's was the protector of young Henry within her house it represented to her "how amiable her conduct would appear in the eye of the world should she condescend to treat this destitute nephew as her own son" it represented to her "the envy such heroic virtue would excite in the hearts of her particular friends and what grief in the bosom of all those who did not like her"  The dean was a man of acute penetration he understood the thoughts which upon this occasion passed in the mind of his wife and in order to insure her kind treatment of the boy instead of reproaching her for the cold manner in which she had at first received him he praised her tender and sympathetic heart for having shown him so much kindness and thus stimulated her vanity to be praised still more  William the mother's own son far from apprehending a rival in this savage  boy was convinced of his own preeminence and felt an affection for him though rather as a foil than as a cousin He sported with his ignorance upon all occasions and even lay in wait for circumstances that might expose it while young Henry strongly impressed with every thing that appeared new to him expressed without reserve the sensations which those novelties excited and felt little care what construction was put upon his observations  He never appeared offended or a bashed when laughed at but still pursued his questions and still discovered his wonder at many replies made to him though "simpleton" "poor filly boy" and "ideot" were vociferated around him from his cousin his aunt and their constant visitor the bishop  His uncle would frequently undertake to instruct him so indeed would the bishop but Lady Clementina her son and the greatest part of her companions found something so irresistibly ridiculous in his remarks that nothing but immoderate laughter followed they thought such folly had even merit in the way of  entertainment and they wished him no wiser  Having been told that every morning on first seeing his uncle he was to make a respectful bow and coming into the dean's dressing room just as he was out of bed his wig lying on the table Henry appeared at a loss which of the two he should bow toat last he gave the preference to his uncle but afterwards bowed reverently to the wig In this he did what he conceived was proper from the introduction which the dean on his first arrival had given him to this venerable stranger for in reality Henry had a contempt for all finery and had called even his aunt's jewels when they were first shown to him "trumpery" asking "what they were good for" But being corrected in this disrespect and informed of their high value he like a good convert gave up his reason to his faith and becoming like all converts over zealous he now believed there was great worth in glittering appearances and respected the earrings of Lady Clementina almost as much as he respected her  CHAPTER XIII  IT was to be lamented that when young Henry had been several months in England had been taught to read and had of course in the society in which he lived seen much of the enlightened world yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no means answered  Notwithstanding the sensibility which upon various occasions he manifested in the most captivating degree notwithstanding the seeming gentleness of his nature upon all occasions there now appeared in most of his enquiries and remarks a something which demonstrated either a stupid or troublesome disposition either dulness of conception or an obstinacy of perseverance in comments and in arguments that were glaringly false  Observing his uncle one day offended with his coachman and hearing him say to him in a very angry tone "You shall never drive me again"  The moment the man quitted the room Henry with his eyes fixed in the deepest contemplation repeated five or six times in a half whisper to himself  "You shall never drive me again"  "You shall never drive me again"  The dean at last asked "what he meant by thus repeating his words"  "I am trying to find out what  you  meant" said Henry  "What do not you know" cried his enlightened cousin "Richard is turned awayhe is never to get upon our coachbox again never to drive any of us any more"  "And was it pleasure to drive us cousinI am sure I have often pitied himit rained sometimes very hard when he was on the boxand sometimes Lady Clementina has kept him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and snowwas that pleasure"  "No" replied young William  "Was it honour cousin"  "No" exclaimed his cousin with a contemptuous smile  "Then why did my uncle say to him as a punishment "he should never"  "Come hither child" said the dean "and let me instruct youyour father's negligence has been inexcusableThere are in society" continued the dean "rich and poor the poor are born to serve the rich"  "And what are the rich born for"  "To be served by the poor"  "But suppose the poor would not serve them"  "Then they must starve"  "And so poor people are permitted to live only upon condition that they wait upon the rich"  "Is that a hard condition or if it were they will be rewarded in a better world than this"  "Is there a better world than this"  "Is it possible you do not know there is"  "I heard my father once say something about a world to come but he stopt short and said I was too young to understand what he meant"  "The world to come" returned the dean "is where we shall go after death and there no distinction will be made  between rich and poorall persons there will be equal"  "Aye now I see what makes it a better world than this But cannot this world try to be as good as that"  "In respect to placing all persons on a level it is utterly impossibleGod has ordained it otherwise"  "How has God ordained a distinction to be made and will not make any himself"  The dean did not proceed in his instructions he now began to think his brother in the right and that the boy was too young or too weak to comprehend the subject  CHAPTER XIV  IN addition to his ignorant conversation upon many topics young Henry had an incorrigible misconception and misapplication of many  words  his father having had but few opportunities of discoursing with him upon account of his attendance at the court of the savages and not having books in the island he had consequently many words to learn of this country's language when he arrived in England this task his retentive memory made easy to him but his childish inattention to their proper signification still made his want of education conspicuous  He would call  compliments liesReserve  he would call  pridestateliness affectation  and for the monosyllable  war  he constantly substituted the word  massacre  "Sir" said William to his father one morning as he entered the room "do you hear how the cannons are firing and the bells ringing"  "Then I dare say" cried Henry "there has been another massacre"  The dean called to him in anger "Will you never learn the right use of words You mean to say a battle"  "Then what is a massacre" cried the frightened but still curious Henry  "A massacre" replied his uncle "is when a number of people are slain"  "I thought" returned Henry "soldiers had been people"  "You interrupt me" said the dean "before I finished my sentencecertainly both soldiers and sailors are people but they engage to die by their own free will and consent"  "What all of them"  "Most of them"  "But the rest are massacred"  The dean answered "The number that go to battle unwillingly and by force are few and for the others they have previously sold their lives to the state  "For what"  "For soldiers' and sailors' pay"  "My father used to tell me we must not take away our own lives but he  forgot to tell me we might sell them for others to take away"  "William" said the dean to his son his patience tired with his nephew's persevering nonsense "explain to your cousin the difference between a battle and a massacre"  "A massacre" said William rising from his seat and fixing his eyes alternately upon his father his mother and the bishop all of whom were present for their approbation rather than the person's to whom his instructions were to be addressed"a massacre" said William "is when human beings are slain who have it not in their power to defend themselves"  "Dear cousin William" said Henry "that must ever be the case with every one who is killed"  After a short hesitation William replied "In massacres people are put to death for no crime but merely because they are objects of suspicion"  "But in battle" said Henry "the persons put to death are not even suspected"  The bishop now condescended to end this disputation by saying emphatically  "Consider young savage that in battle neither the infant the aged the sick or infirm are involved but only those in the full prime of health and vigour"  As this argument came from so great and reverend a man as the bishop Henry was obliged by a frown from his uncle to submit as one refuted although he had an answer at the veriest tip of his tongue which it was torture to him not to utter What he wished to say must ever remain a secret The church has its terrors as well as the law and Henry was awed by the dean's tremendous wig as much as Paternoster Row is awed by the attorneygeneral  CHAPTER XV  IF the dean had loved his wife but moderately seeing all her faults clearly as he did he must frequently have quarrelled with her if he had loved her with tenderness he must have treated her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her failings but having neither personal nor mental affection towards her sufficiently interesting to give himself the trouble to contradict her will in any thing he passed for one of the best husbands in the world Lady Clementina went out when she liked staid at home when she liked dressed as she liked and talked as she liked without a word of disapprobation from her husband and allbecause he cared nothing about her  Her vanity attributed this indulgence to inordinate affection and observers in general thought her happier in her marriage than the beloved wife who bathes her pillow with her tears by the side of an angry husband whose affection is so excessive  that he unkindly upbraids her because she isless than perfection  The dean's wife was not so dispassionately considered by some of his acquaintance as by himself for they would now and then hint at her foibles but this great liberty she also conceived to be the effect of most violent love or most violent admiration and such would have been her construction had they commended her follieshad they totally slighted or had they beaten her  Amongst those acquaintances the Bishop of **** by far the most frequent visitor did not come merely to lounge an idle hour but he had a more powerful motive the desire of fame and dread of being thought a man receiving large emolument for unimportant service  The dean if he did not procure him the renown he wished still preserved him from the apprehended censure  The elder William was to his negligent or ignorant superiors in the church such as an apt boy at school is to the rich duncesWilliam performed the prelates' tasks for them and they rewarded him  not indeed with toys or money but with their countenance their company their praiseAnd scarcely was there a sermon preached from the patrician part of the bench that the dean did not fashion some periods blot out some uncouth phrases render some obscure sentiments intelligible and was the certain person when the work was printed to correct the press  The Honourable and Right Reverend Bishop of **** delighted in printing and publishing his works or rather the entire works of the dean which passed for hisand so degradingly did William the shopkeeper's son think of his own honest extraction that he was blinded even to the loss of honour by the lustre of this noble acquaintance for though in other respects a man of integrity yet when the gratification of his friend was the concern he was a liar he not only disowned his giving him aid in any of his publications but he never published any thing in his own name without declaring to the world "That he had been obliged for all the hints on the subject for many of the most judicious corrections and for  those passages in page so and so naming the most eloquent part of the work to his noble and learned friend the bishop  The dean's wife being a fine ladywhile her husband and his friend pored over books or their own manuscripts at home she ran from house to house from public amusement to public amusement but much less for the pleasure of  seeing  than for that of being  seen  Nor was it material to her enjoyment whether she was observed or welcome where she went as she never entertained the smallest doubt of either but rested assured that her presence roused curiosity and dispensed gladness all around  One morning she went forth to pay he visits all smiles such as she thought captivating she returned all tears such as she thought no less endearing  Three ladies accompanied her home entreating her to be patient under a misfortune to which even kings are liable namely defamation  Young Henry struck with compassion at grief of which he knew not yet the cause begged to know "What was the matter"  "Inhuman monsters to treat a woman thus" cried his aunt in furycasting the corner of her eye into a lookingglass to see how rage became her  "But comfort yourself" said one of her companions "few people will believe you merit the charge"  "But few if only one believe it I shall call my reputation lost and I will shut myself in some lonely hut and give up all that is dear to me for ever"  "What all your fine cloaths" said Henry in amazement  "Of what importance will my best dreffes be when nobody would see them"  "You would see them yourself dear aunt and I am sure nobody admires them more"  "Now you speak of that" said she "I do not think this gown I have on becomingI am sure I look"  The dean with the bishop to whom he had been reading a treatise just going to the press which was to be published in the name of the latter though written by the former now entered to enquire why they had been sent for in such haste  "Oh dean Oh my lord" she cried resuming that grief which the thoughts of her dress had for a time dispelled" My reputation is destroyeda public print has accused me of playing deep at my own house and winning all the money"  "The world will never reform" said the bishop "all our labour my friend is thrown away"  "But is it possible" cried the dean "that any one has dared to say this of you"  "Here it is in print" Said she holding out a newspaper  The dean read the paragraph and then exclaimed "I can forgive a falsehood  spoken  the warmth of conversation may excuse itbut to  write  and  print  an untruth is unpardonableand I will prosecute this publisher"  "Still the falsehood will go down to posterity" said Lady Clementina "and after ages will think I was a gambler"  "Comfort yourself dear madam" said young Henry wishing to console her "perhaps after ages may not hear of you nor even the present age think much about you"  The bishop now exclaimed after having taken the paper from the dean and read the paragraph "It is a libel a rank libel and the author must be punished"  "Not only the author but the publisher" Said the dean  "Not only the publisher but the printer" Continued the bishop  "And must my name be bandied about by lawyers in a common court of justice" cried Lady Clementina "How shocking to my delicacy"  "My lord it is a pity we cannot try them by the ecclesiastical court" Said the dean with a sigh  "Nor by the India delinquent bill" said the bishop with vexation  "So totally innocent as I am" she vociferated with sobs "Every one knows I never touch a card at home and this libel charges me with playing at my own houseand though whenever I do play I own I am apt to win yet it is merely for my amusement"  "Win or not win play or not play" exclaimed both the churchmen "this is a libel no doubt no doubt a libel"  Poor Henry's confined knowledge of his native language tormented him so much with curiosity upon this occasion that he went softly up to his uncle and asked him in a whisper "What was the meaning of the word libel"  "A libel" replied the dean in a raised voice "is that which one person publishes to the injury of another"  "And what can the injured person do" asked Henry "if the accusation should chance to be true"  "Prosecute" Replied the dean  "But then what does he do if the accusation is false"  "Prosecute likewise" Answered the dean  "How uncle is it possible that the innocent behave just like the guilty"  "There is no other way to act"  "Why then if I was the innocent I would do nothing at all sooner than I would act like the guilty I would not persecute"  "I said  prosecute  " Cried the dean in anger "Leave the room you have no comprehension"  "Oh yes now I understand the difference of the two wordsbut they sound so alike I did not observe the distinction at first You said "the innocent  prosecute  but the guilty  persecute  " He bowed convinced as he thought and left the room  "After this modern starchamber which was left sitting had agreed on its mode of vengeance and the writer of the libel was made acquainted with his danger he waited in all humility upon Lady Clementina and assured her with every appearance of sincerity  "That she was not the person alluded to by the paragraph in question but that the initials which she had conceived to mark out her name were in fact meant to point out Lady Catharine Newland"  "But Sir" cried Lady Clementina "what could induce you to write such a paragraph upon Lady Catharine She  never  plays"  "We know that madam or we dared not have attacked her Though we must circulate libels madam to gratify our numerous readers yet no people are more in fear of prosecutions than authors and  editors therefore unless we are deceived in our information we always take care to libel the innocentwe apprehend nothing from themtheir own characters support thembut the guilty are very tenacious and what they cannot secure by fair means they will employ force to accomplish Dear madam be assured I have too much regard for a wife and seven small children who are maintained by my industry alone to have written any thing in the nature of a libel upon your ladyship"  CHAPTER XVI  ABOUT this period the dean had just published a pamphlet in his own name and in which that of his friend the bishop was only mentioned with thanks for hints observations and condescending encouragement to the author  This pamphlet glowed with the dean's love for his country and such a country as he described it was impossible  not  to love "Salubrious air fertile fields wood water corn grass sheep oxen fish fowl fruit and vegetables" were dispersed with the most prodigal hand"valiant men pretty women statesmen wise and just tradesmen abounding in merchandise and money husbandmen possessing peace ease plenty and all ranks liberty"This brilliant description while the dean read the work to his family so charmed poor Henry that he repeatedly cried out  "I am glad I came to this country"  But it so happened that a few days after Lady Clementina in order to render  the delicacy of her taste admired could eat of no one dish upon the table but found fault with them all The dean at length said to her  "Indeed you are too nicereflect upon the hundreds of poor creatures who have not a morsel or a drop of any thing to subsist upon except bread and water and even of the first a scanty allowance but for which they are obliged to toil six days in the week from sun to sun"  "Pray uncle" cried Henry "in what country do these poor people live"  "In this country" Replied the dean  Henry rose from his chair ran to the chimneypiece took up his uncle's pamphlet and said "I don't remember your mentioning them here"  "Perhaps I have not" Answered the dean coolly  Still Henry turned over each leaf of the book but he could meet only with luxurious details of "the fruits of the earth the beasts of the field the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea"  "Why here is provision enough for all the people" said Henry "why should  they want why do not they go and take some of these things"  "They must not" said the dean "unless they were their own"  "What uncle does no part of the earth nor any thing which the earth produces belong to the poor"  "Certainly not"  "Why did not you say so then in your pamphlet"  "Because it is what every body knows"  "Oh then what you have said in your pamphlet is only whatnobody knows"  There appeared to the dean in the delivery of this sentence a satirical acrimony which his irritability as an author could but ill forgive  An author it is said has more acute feelings in respect to his works than any artist in the world besides  Henry had some cause on the present occasion to think this observation just for no sooner had he spoken the foregoing words than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room and leading him to his study there he enumerated his various faults and having told him "it was  for all those too long permitted with impunity and not merely for the  present  impertinence that he meant to punish him" ordered him to close confinement in his chamber for a week  In the mean time the dean's pamphlet less hurt by Henry's critique than  he  had been was proceeding to the tenth edition and the author acquiring literary reputation beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the bishop  The style the energy the eloquence of the work was echoed by every reader who could afford to buy itsome few enlightened ones excepted who chiefly admired the author's  invention  CHAPTER XVII  THE dean in the good humour which the rapid sale of his book produced once more took his nephew to his bosom and although the ignorance of young Henry upon the late occasions had offended him very highly yet that selfsame ignorance evinced a short time after upon a different subject struck his uncle as productive of a most rare and exalted virtue  Henry had frequently in his conversation betrayed the total want of all knowledge in respect to religion or futurity and the dean for this reason delayed taking him to church till he had previously given him instructions  wherefore  he went  A leisure morning arrived on which he took his nephew to his study and implanted in his youthful mind the first unconfused idea of the Creator of the universe  The dean was eloquent Henry was all attention his understanding expanded  by time to the conception of a Godand not warped by custom from the sensations which a just notion of that God inspires dwelt with delight and wonder on the information given himlessons which instilled into the head of a senseless infant too often produce throughout his remaining life an impious indifference to the truths revealed  Yet with all that astonished that respectful sensibility which Henry showed on this great occasion he still expressed his opinion and put questions to the dean with his usual simplicity till he felt himself convinced  "What" cried heafter being informed of the attributes inseparable from the Supreme Being and having received the injunction to offer prayers to him night and morning "What am I permitted to speak to power divine"  "At all times" Replied the dean  "What whenever I like"  "Whenever you like" Returned the dean  "I durst not" cried Henry "make so free with the bishop nor dare any of his attendants"  "The bishop" said the dean "is the servant of God and therefore must be treated with respect"  "With more respect than his master" asked Henry  The dean not replying immediately to this question Henry in the rapidity of enquiry ran to another "But what am I to say when I speak to the Almighty"  "First thank him for the favours he has bestowed on you"  "What favours"  "You amaze me" cried the dean "by your question Do not you live in ease in plenty and happiness"  "And do the poor and the unhappy thank him too uncle"  "No doubtevery human being glorifies him for having been made a rational creature"  "And does my aunt and all her card parties glorify him for that"  The dean again made no replyand Henry went on to other questions till his uncle had fully instructed him as to the nature and the form of  prayer  and now putting into his hands a book he pointed  out to him a few short prayers which he wished him to address to heaven in his presence  Whilst Henry bent his knees as his uncle had directed he trembledturned paleand held for a slight support on the chair placed before him  His uncle went to him and asked him "What was the matter"  "Oh" cried Henry "when I first came to your door with my poor father's letter I shook for fear you would not look upon meand I cannot help feeling even more now than I did then"  The dean embraced him with warmthgave him confidenceand retired to the other side of the study to observe his whole demeanour on this new occasion  As he beheld his features varying between the passions of humble fear and servent hopehis face sometimes glowing with the rapture of thanksgiving and sometimes with the blushes of contrition he thus exclaimed apart  "This is the true education on which to found the principles of religionThe favour conferred by heaven in granting  the freedom of petitions to its throne can never be conceived with proper force but by those whose most tedious moments during their infancy were  not  passed in prayer Unthinking governors of childhood to insult the Deity with a form of worship in which the mind has no share nay worse has repugnance and by the thoughtless habits of youth prevent even in age devotion  Henry's attention was so firmly fixed that he forgot there was a spectator of his fervour nor did he hear young William enter the chamber and even speak to his father  At length closing his book and rising from his knees he approached his uncle and cousin with a sedateness in his air which gave the latter a very false opinion of the state of his youthful companion's mind  "So Mr Henry" cried William "you have been obliged to say your prayers at last"  The dean informed his son "That to Henry it was no punishment to pray"  "He is the strangest boy I ever knew" Said William inadvertently  "To be sure" said Henry "I was frightened when I first knelt but when I came to the words  Father which art in heaven  they gave me courage for I know how merciful and kind a  father  is beyond any one else"  The dean again embraced his nephew let fall a tear to his poor brother Henry's misfortunes and admonished the youth to show himself equally submissive to other instructions as he had done to those which inculcate piety  CHAPTER XVIII  THE interim between youth and manhood was passed by young William and young Henry in studious application to literature some casual mistakes in our customs and manners on the part of Henry some too close adherences to them on the side of William  Their different characters when boys were preserved when they were men Henry still retained that natural simplicity which his early destiny had given him he wondered still at many things he saw and heard and at times would venture to give his opinion contradict and even act in opposition to persons whom long experience and the approbation of the world had placed in situations that claimed his implicit reverence and submission  Unchanged in all his boyish graces young William now a man was never known to infringe upon the statutes of goodbreeding even though sincerity his own free will duty to his neighbour  with many other plebeian virtues and privileges were the sacrifice  William inherited all the pride and ambition of the deanHenry all his father's humility And yet so various and extensive is the acceptation of the word pride that on some occasions Henry was proud even beyond his cousin He thought it far beneath his dignity ever to honour or contemplate with awe any human being in whom he saw numerous failings Nor would he to ingratiate himself into the favour of a man above him stoop to one servility such as the haughty William daily practised  "I know I am called proud" One day said William to Henry  "Dear cousin" replied Henry "it must be only then by those who do not know you for to me you appear the humblest creature in the world"  "Do you really think so"  "I am certain of it or would you always give up your opinion to that of persons in a superior state however inferior in their understanding Would else their weak judgment immediately change  yours though before you had been decided on the opposite side Now indeed cousin I have more pride than you for I never will stoop to act or to speak contrary to my feelings  "Then you will never be a great man"  "Nor ever desire it if I must first be a mean one"  There was in the reputation of these two young men another mistake which the common retailers of character committed Henry was said to be wholly negligent while William was reputed to be extremely fond of the other sex William indeed was gallant was amorous and indulged his inclination to the libertine society of women but Henry it was who  loved  them He admired them at a reverential distance and felt so tender an affection for the virtuous part that it shocked him to behold much more to associate with the depraved and vicious  In the advantages of person Henry was still superior to William and yet the latter had no common share of those attractions which captivate weak thoughtless or unskilful minds  CHAPTER XIX  ABOUT the time that Henry and William quitted college and had arrived at their twentieth year the dean made the purchase of a small estate in a village near to the country residence of Lord and Lady Bendham and in the total want of society the dean's family were frequently honoured with invitations from the great house  Lord Bendham besides a good estate possessed the office of a lord of the bedchamber to his majesty Historians do not ascribe much importance to the situation or to the talents of nobles in this department nor shall this little history A lord of the bedchamber is a personage well known in courts and in all capitals where courts reside with this advantage to the inquirer that in becoming acquainted with one of those noble characters you become acquainted with all the remainder not only with those of the same kingdom but those of foreign  nations for in whatever land in whatever climate a lord of the bedchamber must necessarily be the selfsame creature one wholly made up of observance of obedience of dependance and of imitationa borrowed charactera character formed by reflection  The wife of this illustrious peer as well as himself took her hue like the chameleon from surrounding objects her manners were not governed by her mind but were solely directed by external circumstances At court humble resigned patient attentiveAt balls masquerades gamingtables and routs gay sprightly and flippantAt her country seat reserved austere arrogant and gloomy  Though in town her timid eye in presence of certain persons would scarce uplift its trembling lid so much she felt her own insignificance yet in the country till Lady Clementina arrived there was not one being of consequence enough to share in her acquaintance and she paid back to her inferiors there all the humiliating slights and all the mortifications  which in London she received from those to whom  she  was inferior  Whether in town or country it is but justice to acknowledge that in her own person she was strictly chaste but in the country she extended that chastity even to the person of others and the young woman who lost her virtue in the village of Anfield had better have lost her life Some few were now and then found hanging or drowned while no other cause could be assigned for their despair than an imputation on their character and dread of the harsh purity of Lady Bendham She would remind the parish priest of the punishment ordained for female dishonour and by her influence had caused many an unhappy girl to do public penance in their own or the neighbouring churches  But this country rigour in town she could dispense withal and like other ladies of virtue she there visited and received into her house the acknowledged mistresses of a man in elevated life it was not therefore the crime but the rank which the criminal held in society that  drew down Lady Bendham's vengeance she even carried her distinction of classes in female error to such a very nice point that the adulterous concubine of an elder brother was her most intimate acquaintance while the less guilty unmarried mistress of the younger she would not fully her lips to exchange a word with  Lord and Lady Bendham's birth education talents and propensities being much on the same scale of eminence they would have been a very happy pair had not one great misfortune intervenedThe lady never bore her lord a childWhile every cottage of the village was crammed with halfstarved children whose father from week to week from year to year exerted his manly youth and wasted his strength in vain to protect them from hunger whose mother mourned over her newborn infant as a little wretch sent into the world to deprive the rest of what already was too scanty for them in the castle that owned every cottage and all the surrounding land and where one single day of feasting would have nourished for a month all the poor inhabitants  of the parish not one child was given to partake of the plenty The curse of barrenness was on the family of the lord of the manorthe curse of fruitfulness upon the famished poor  This lord and lady with an ample fortune both by inheritance and their sovereign's favour had never yet the oeconomy to be exempt from debts still over their splendid their profuse table they could contrive and plan excellent schemes "how the poor might live most comfortably with a little better management"  The wages of a labouring man with a wife and half a dozen small children Lady Bendham thought quite sufficient if they would only learn a little oeconomy  "You know my lord those people never want to dressshoes and stockings a coat and a waistcoat a gown and a cap a petticoat and a handkerchief is all they wantfire to be sure in winterthen all the rest is merely for provision"  "I'll get a pen and ink" said young Henry one day when he had the honour  of being at their table "and see what the  rest  amounts to"  "No no accounts" cried my lord "no summing up but if you were to calculate you must add to the receipts of the poor my gift at ChristmasLast year during the frost no less than a hundred pounds"  "How benevolent" Exclaimed the dean  "How prudent" Exclaimed Henry  "What do you mean by prudent" asked Lord Bendham "Explain your meaning"  "No my lord" replied the dean "do not ask for an explanation this youth is wholly unacquainted with our customs and though a man in stature is but a child in intellects Henry have not I often cautioned you"  "Whatever his thoughts are upon this subject" cried Lord Bendham "I desire to know them"  "Why then my lord" answered Henry "I thought it was prudent in you to give a little lest the poor driven to despair should take all"  "And if they had they would have been hanged"  "Hanging my lord our history or some tradition says was formerly adopted as a mild punishment in place of starving"  "I am sure" cried Lady Bendham who seldom spoke directly to the argument before her "I am sure they ought to think themselves much obliged to us"  "That is the greatest hardship of all" Cried Henry  "What sir" Exclaimed the earl  "I beg your pardonmy uncle looks displeasedI am very ignorantI did not receive my first education in this countryand I find I think so differently from every one else that I am ashamed to utter my sentiments"  "Never mind young man" answered Lord Bendham "we shall excuse your ignorance for once Only inform us what it was you just now called  the greatest hardship of all  "  "It was my lord that what the poor receive to keep them from perishing should pass under the name of  gifts  and  bounty  Health strength and the will to earn a moderate subsistence ought to be every man's security from obligation"  "I think a hundred pounds a great deal of money" cried Lady Bendham "and I hope my lord will never give it again"  "And so do I" cried Henry for if my lord would only be so good as to speak a few words for the poor as a senator he might possibly for the future keep his hundred pounds and yet they never want it"  Lord Bendham had the good nature only to smile at Henry's simplicity whispering to himself "I had rather keep my" His last word was lost in the whisper  CHAPTER XX  IN the countrywhere the sensible heart is still more susceptible of impressions and where the unfeeling mind in the want of other wits to invent forms schemes for its own amusementour youths both fell in love if passions that were pursued on the most opposite principles can receive the same appellation William well versed in all the licentious theory thought himself in love because he perceived a tumultuous impulse cause his heart to beat while his fancy fixed on a certain object whose presence agitated yet more his breast  Henry thought himself not in love because while he listened to William on the subject he found their sensations did not in the least agree  William owned to Henry that he loved Hannah the daughter of a cottager in the village and hoped to make her his mistress  Henry felt that his tender regard for Rebecca the daughter of the curate of the parish did not inspire him even with the boldness to acquaint her with his sentiments much less to meditate one design that might tend to her dishonour  While William was cautiously planning how to meet in private and accomplish the seduction of the object of his passion Henry was endeavouring to fortify the object of  his  choice with every virtue He never read a book from which he received improvement that he did not carry it to Rebeccanever knew a circumstance that might assist towards her moral instruction that he did not haste to tell it herand once when William boasted  "He knew he was beloved by Hannah"  Henry said with equal triumph "he had not dared to take the means to learn nor had Rebecca dared to give one instance of her partiality"  Rebecca was the youngest and by far the least handsome daughter of four to whom the Reverend Mr Rymer a  widower was father The other sisters were accounted beauties and she from her comparative want of personal charms having been less beloved by her parents and less caressed by those who visited them than the rest had for some time past sought other resources of happiness than the affection praise and indulgence of her fellowcreatures She readbut moreshe thought The choicest books from her father's little library taught her to think and reflection fashioned her mind to bear the slights the mortifications of neglect with a patient dejection rather than with an indignant or a peevish spirit  This resignation to injury and contumely gave to her perfect symmetry of person a timid eye a retiring manner and spread upon her face a placid sweetness a pale serenity mixed with sense and taste that no wise connoisseur in female charms would have exchanged for all the sparkling eyes and florid tints of her vain and vulgar sistersHenry's soul was so much enamoured of her gentle deportment that in his sight she appeared beautiful while sue with an understanding  competent to judge of his worth was so greatly surprised so prodigiously astonished at the distinction the attention the many offices of civility paid to her by him in preference to her idolised sisters that her gratitude for such unexpected favours had sometimes even in his presence and in that of her family nearly drowned her eyes with tears Yet they were only trifles in which Henry had the opportunity or the power to give her testimony of his regardtrifles often more grateful to the sensible mind than efforts of high importance and by which the artist in the human heart will accurately trace a passion wholly concealed from the dull eye of the unskilled observer  The first cause of amazement to Rebecca in the manners of Henry was that he talked with  her  as well as with her sisters no visitor else had done so In taking a morning's or an evening's walk he proposed  her  going with the rest no one had ever required her company before When he called and she was absent he asked where she was no one  had ever missed her beforeShe thanked him from her very heart and soon perceived that at those times when he was present company was more pleasing even than books  Her astonishment her gratitude did not stop hereHenry proceeded in attentionhe soon selected her from her sisters to tell the news of the day when he chanced to call answered her observations the first once gave her a sprig of myrtle from his bosom in preference to another who had praised its beauty and oncenever to be forgotten kindnesssheltered her from a hasty shower with his  parapluie  while he lamented to her drenched companions  "That he had but  one  to offer"  From a man whose sense and person they admire how dear how impressive on the female heart is every trait of tenderness Till now Rebecca had experienced none not even of the parental kind and merely from the overflowings of a kind nature not in return for affection had she ever loved her father and her sisters Sometimes repulsed by their  severity she transferred the fulness of an affectionate heart upon animals but now her alienated mind was recalled and softened by a sensation that made her long to complain of the burthen it imposedthose obligations which exact silence are a heavy weight to the gratefulRebecca longed to tell Henry "that her life would be too little to express the full sense she had of the respect he paid to her" But as modesty forbade not only every kind of declaration but every insinuation purporting what she felt she wept through sleepless nights from a load of suppressed explanation yet still she would not have exchanged this trouble for all the beauty of her sisters  CHAPTER XXI  OLD John and Hannah Primrose a prudent hardy couple who by many years of peculiar labour and peculiar abstinence were the least poor of all the neighbouring cottagers had an only child called after the mother Hannah and this cottage girl was reckoned in spite of the beauty of the elder Miss Rymers by far the prettiest female in the village  Reader of superior rank if the passions which rage in the bosom of the inferior class of human kind are beneath your sympathy throw aside this little history for Rebecca Rymer and Hannah Primrose are its heroines  But you unprejudiced reader whose liberal observations are not confined to stations but who consider all mankind alike deserving your investigation who believe that there exists in some knowledge without the advantage of instruction refinement of sentiment independent of elegant society honourable pride  of heart without dignity of blood and genius destitute of art to render it conspicuous  You  will perhaps venture to read on in hopes that the remainder of this story may deserve your attention just as the wild herb of the forest equally with the cultivated plant in the garden claims the attention of the botanist  When young William saw Hannah he thought her even more beautiful than she was thought by others and on those days that he felt no inclination to ride to shoot or to hunt he would contrive by some secret device the means to meet with her alone and give her tokens if not of his love at least of his admiration of her beauty and of the pleasure he enjoyed in her company  Hannah listened with a kind of delirious enchantment to all her elevated and eloquent admirer uttered and in return for his praises of her charms and his equivocal replies in respect to his designs towards her gave to him her most undisguised thoughts and her whole enraptured heart  This to her apparently harmless intercourse had not lasted many weeks before  she loved himshe even confessed she did every time that any unwonted mark of attention from him struck with unexpected force her infatuated senses  It has been said by a celebrated writer upon the affection subsisting between the two sexes "that there are many persons who if they had never heard of the passion of love would never have felt it" Might it not with equal truth be added thatthere are many more who having heard of it and believing most firmly that they feel it are nevertheless mistaken Neither of these cases was the lot of Hannah She experienced the sentiment before she ever heard it named in that sense in which she felt itand she felt it as genuine love alone existsjoined with numerous other sentiments for love however rated by many as the chief passion of the human heart is but a poor dependant a retainer upon other passions admiration gratitude respect esteem pride in the objectdivest the boasted sensation of these and it is no more than the impression of a twelvemonth by courtesy or vulgar error termed love  Hannah was formed by the rarest structure of the human frame and fated by the tenderest thrillings of the human soul to inspire and to experience real lovebut her nice taste her delicate thoughts were so refined beyond the sphere of her own station in society that nature would have produced this prodigy of attraction in vain had not one of superior education and manners assailed her heart and had she been accustomed to the conversation of men in William's rank of life she had perhaps treated William's addresses with indifference but in comparing him with her familiar acquaintance he was a miracle His unremitted attention seemed the condescension of a superior being to whom she looked up with reverence with admiration with awe with pride with sense of obligationand all those various passions which constitute true and  never  to be eradicated love  But in vain she felt and even avowed with her lips what every look every gesture had long denoted William with discontent sometimes with anger upbraided  her for her false professions and vowed "That while one tender proof which he fervently besought was wanting she did but aggravate his misery by lesser endearments"  Hannah had been taught the full estimation of female virtue and if her nature could have detested one being in a state of wretchedness it would have been the woman who had lost her honour yet for William what would not Hannah forfeit The dignity the peace the serenity the innocence of her own mind love soon encouraged her to fancy she could easily foregoand this same overpowering influence at times so forcibly possessed her that she even felt a momentary transport in the idea "of so precious a sacrifice to him"But then she loved her parents and their happiness she could not prevail on herself to barter even for  his  She wished he would demand some other pledge of her affection for there was none but this her ruin in no other shape that she would deny at his request While thus she deliberated she prepared for her fall  Bred up with strict observance both to his moral and religious character William did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even to his inferiorshe never promised Hannah he would marry her nay even he paid so much respect to the forms of truth that no sooner was it evident that he had obtained her heart her whole soul entireso that loss of innocence would be less terrifying than separation from himno sooner did he perceive this than he candidly told her he "could never make her his wife"At the same time he lamented "the difference of their births and the duty he owed his parents' hopes" in terms so pathetic to her partial ear that she thought him a greater object of compassion in love even than herself and was now urged by pity to remove the cause of his complainings  One evening Henry accidentally passed the lonely spot where William and she constantly methe observed his cousin's impassioned eye and her affectionate yet fearful glance William he saw took delight in the agitation of mind in the strong apprehension mixed with the love  of Hannah this convinced Henry that either he or himself was not in love for his heart told him he would not have beheld such emotions of tenderness mingled with such marks of sorrow upon the countenance of Rebecca for the wealth of the universe  The first time he was alone with William after this he mentioned his observation on Hannah's apparent affliction and asked "Why her grief was the result of their stolen meetings"  "Because" replied William "her professions are unlimited while her manners are reserved and I accuse her of loving me with unkind moderation while I love her to distraction"  "You design to marry her then"  "How can you degrade me by the supposition"  "Would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her your companion To talk with her for hours in preference to all other company To wish to be endeared to her by still closer ties"  "But all this is not raising her to the rank of my wife"  "It is still raising her to that rank for which wives alone were allotted"  "You talk wildlyI tell you I love her but not enough I hope to marry her"  "But too much I hope to undo her"  "That must be her own free choiceI make use of no unwarrantable methods"  "What are the warrantable ones"  "I mean I have made her no false promisesoffered no pretended settlementvowed no eternal constancy"  "But you have told her you love her and from that confession has she not reason to expect every protection which even promises could secure"  "I cannot answer for her expectationsbut I know if she should make me happy as I ask and I should then forsake her I shall not break my word"  "Still she will be deceived for you will falsify your looks"  "Do you think she depends on my looks"  "I have read in some book  Looks are the lover's sole dependence  "  "I have no objection to her interpreting mine in her favour but then for the consequences she will have herself and only herself to blame"  "Oh heaven"  "What makes you exclaim so vehemently"  "An idea of the bitterness of that calamity which inflicts selfreproach Oh rather deceive herleave her the consolation to reproach you  rather than  herself"  "My honour will not suffer me"  "Exert your honour and never see her more"  "I cannot live without her"  "Then live with her by the laws of your country and make her and yourself both happy"  "Am I to make my father and my mother miserable They would disown me for such a step"  "Your mother perhaps might be offended but your father could not Remember the sermon he preached but last Sunday upon  the shortness of this life contempt of all riches and worldly honours  in balance with a quiet conscience  and the assurance he gave us  that the greatest happiness enjoyed upon earth was under an humble roof with heaven in prospect  "  "My father is a very good man" said William "and yet instead of being satisfied with an humble roof he looks impatiently forward to a bishop's palace"  "He is so very good then" said Henry "that perhaps seeing the dangers to which men in exalted stations are exposed he has such extreme philanthropy and so little selflove he would rather that himself should brave those perils incidental to wealth and grandeur than any other person"  "You are not yet civilised" said William "and to argue with you is but to instruct without gaining instruction"  "I know Sir" replied Henry "that you are studying the law most assiduously and have vast prospects of rising to eminence in your profession but let me hint to youthat though you may be perfect in the knowledge how to administer  the commandments of men unless you keep in view the precepts of God your judgment like mine will be fallible"  CHAPTER XXII  THE dean's family passed this first summer at the newpurchased estate so pleasantly that they left it with regret when winter called them to their house in town  But if some felt concern on quitting the village of Anfield some who were left behind felt the deepest anguish Those were not the poorfor rigid attention to the morals of people in poverty and total neglect of their bodily wants was the dean's practice He forced them to attend church on every sabbath but whether they had a dinner on their return was too gross and temporal an enquiry for his spiritual fervour Good of the  soul  was all he aimed at and this pious undertaking besides his diligence as a pastor required all his exertion as a magistratefor to be very poor and very honest very oppressed yet very thankful is a degree of sainted excellence not to be attained without the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue  Those then who alone felt sorrow at the dean's departure were two young women whose parents exempt from indigence preserved them from suffering under his unpitying piety but whose discretion had not protected them from the bewitching smiles of his nephew and seducing wiles of his son  The first morning that Rebecca rose and knew Henry was gone till the following summer she wished she could have lain down again and slept away the whole long interval Her sisters' peevishness her father's austerity she foresaw would be insupportable now that she had experienced Henry's kindness and he was no longer near to fortify her patience She sighedshe weptshe was unhappy  But if Rebecca awoke with a dejected mind and an a king heart what were the sorrows of Hannah The only child of two doating parents she never had been taught the necessity of resignationuntutored unread unused to reflect but knowing how to  feel  what were her sufferings when on waking she called to mind that "William was gone" and  with him gone all that excess of happiness which his presence had bestowed and for which she had exchanged her future tranquillity  Loss of tranquillity even Rebecca had to bemoanHannah had still morethe loss of innocence  Had William remained in the village shame even conscience perhaps had slept but separated from her betrayer parted from the joys of guilt and left only to its sorrows every sting which quick sensibility could sharpen was transfixed in her heart to torture her First came the recollection of a cold farewell from the man whose love she had hoped her yielding passion had for ever wonnext flashed on her thoughts her violated personnext the crime incurrednext her cruelty to her tender parentsand last of all came the horrors of detection  She knew that as yet by wariness care and contrivance her meetings with William had been unsuspected but in this agony of mind her fears foreboded an informer who would defy all caution who would stigmatise her with a namedear  and desired by every virtuous femaleabhorrent to the blushing harlotthe name of mother  That Hannah thus impressed could rise from her bed meet her parents and her neighbours with her usual smile of vivacity and voice of mirth was impossibleto leave her bed at all to creep down stairs and reply in a faint broken voice to questions asked were in her state of mind mighty efforts and all to which her struggles could attain for many weeks  William had promised to write to her while he was away he kept his word but not till the end of two months she received a letter Fears for his health apprehension of his death during this cruel interval caused an agony of suspence that by representing him to her distracted fancy in a state of suffering made him if possible still dearer to her In the excruciating anguish of uncertainty she walked with trembling steps through all weathers when she could steal half a day while her parents were employed in labour abroad to the post  town at six miles distance to enquire for his long expected long wished for letter When at last it was given to her that moment of consolation seemed to repay her for the whole time of agonising terror she had endured "He is alive" she said "and I have suffered nothing"  She hastily put this token of his health and his remembrance of her into her bosom rich as an empress with a newacquired dominion The way from home which she had trod with heavy pace in the fear of renewed disappointment she skimmed along on her return swift as a doethe cold did not pierce neither did the rain wet her Many a time she put her hand upon the prize she possessed to find if it were safeonce on the road she took it from her bosom curiously viewed the seal and the direction then replacing it did not move her fingers from their fast gripe till she arrived at home  Her father and her mother were still absent She drew a chair and placing it near to the only window in the room seated herself with ceremonious order  and then gently drew forth her treasure laid it on her knee and with a smile that almost amounted to a laugh of gladness once more inspected the outward part before she would trust herself with the excessive joy of looking within  "At length the seal was brokenbut the contents still a secret Poor Hannah had learned to write as some youths learn Latin so short a time had been allowed for the acquirement and so little expert had been her master that it took her generally a week to write a letter of ten lines and a month to read one of twenty But this being a letter on which her mind was deeply engaged her whole imagination aided her slender literature and at the end of a fortnight she had made out every wordThey were these  D  r  HANNAH  I HOPE you have been well since we partedI have been very well myself but I have been teazed with a great deal of business which has not given me time to write to you beforeI have been called to the bar which  engages every spare momentbut I hope it will not prevent my coming down to Anfield with my father in the summer  I am  D  r  Hannah  With gratitude for all the favours you have conferred on me Yours c W N  To have beheld the illiterate Hannah try for two weeks day and night to find out the exact words of this letter it would have struck the spectator with amazement to have understood the right the delicate the nicely proper sensations with which she was affected by every sentence it contained  She wished it had been kinder even for his sake who wrote itbecause she thought so well of him and desired still to think so well that she was sorry at any faults that rendered him less worthy of her good opinion The cold civility of his letter had this effecther clear her acute judgment felt it a kind of prevarication  to promise to writeand then write  nothing that was hoped for  But enthralled by the magic of her passion she shortly found excuses for the man she loved at the expence of her own condemnation  "He has only the fault of inconstancy" she cried "and that has been caused by  my  change of conducthad I been virtuous still he had still been affectionate" Bitter thought  Yet there was a sentence in the letter that worse than all the tenderness left out wounded her sensibilityand she could not read the line  gratitude for all the favours conferred on me  without turning pale with horror then kindling with indignation at the commonplace thanks which insultingly reminded her of her innocence her peace of mind given in exchange for unmeaning acknowledgement  CHAPTER XXIII  ABSENCE is said to encrease strong and virtuous love but to destroy that which is weak and sensual In the parallel between young William and young Henry this was the case for Henry's real love encreased while William's turbulent passion declined in separation yet had the latter not so much abated that he did not perceive a sensation like a sudden shock of sorrow on a proposal made him by his father of entering the marriage state with a young woman the dependent niece of Lady Bendham who as the dean informed him had signified her lord's and her own approbation of his becoming their nephew  At the first moment William received this intimation from his father his heart revolted with disgust from the object and he instantly thought upon Hannah with more affection than he had done for many weeks before This was from the comparison between her and his proposed  wife for he had frequently seen Miss Sedgeley at Lord Bendham's but had never seen in her whole person or manners the least attraction to excite his love He pictured to himself an unpleasant home with a companion so little suited to his taste and felt a pang of conscience as well as of attachment in the thought of giving up poor Hannah  But these reflections these feelings lasted no longer than for the moment no sooner had the dean explained why the marriage was desirable recited what great connections and what great patronage it would confer upon their family than William listened with eagerness and both his love and his conscience were if not wholly quieted at least for the present hushed  Immediately after the dean had expressed to Lord and Lady Bendham his son's "sense of the honour and the happiness conferred on him by their condescension in admitting him a member of their noble family"Miss Sedgeley received from her aunt nearly the same shock as William had done from his  father  For she had frequently seen the dean's son at Lord Bendham's but had never seen in his whole person or manners the least attraction to excite her loveshe pictured to herself an unpleasant home with a companion so little suited to her taste  and at this moment she felt a more than usual partiality to the dean's nephew finding the secret hope she had long indulged of winning his affections so near being thwarted  But Miss Sedgeley was too much subjected to the power of her uncle and aunt to have a will of her own at least to dare to utter it She received the commands of Lady Bendham with her accustomed submission while all the consolation for the grief they gave her was "that she resolved to make a very bad wife"  "I shall not care a pin for my husband" she said to herself "and so I will dress and visit and do just as I likehe dares not be unkind because of my aunt Besides now I think again it is not so disagreeable to marry  him  as if I were obliged to marry into any other family because I shall see his cousin Henry as often if not oftener than ever  For Miss Sedgeley with a person he did not like and with a mind thus disposed William began to force himself to shake off every little remaining affection even all pity for the unfortunate the beautiful the sensible the doating Hannah and determined to place in a situation to look down with scorn upon her sorrows this weak this unprincipled woman  Connections interest honours were powerful advocateshis private happiness William deemed trivial compared to public opinionand to be under obligations to a peer his wife's relation gave greater renown in his servile mind than all the advantages that might accrue from his own intrinsic independent worth  In the usual routine of pretended regard and real indifference sometimes disgust between parties allied by what is falsely termed  prudence  the intended union of Mr Norwynne with Miss Sedgeley proceeded in all due form and at their country seats at Anfield during the summer their nuptials were appointed to be celebrated  William was now introduced into all Lord Bendham's courtly circleshis worldly soul was entranced in glare and showhe thought of nothing but places pensions titles retinues and stedfast alert unshaken in the pursuit of honours neglected not the lesser means of rising to prefermenthis own endowments But in this round of attention to pleasures and to study he no more complained to Hannah of "excess of business" Cruel as she had once thought that letter in which he thus apologised for neglecting her she at last began to think it was wondrous kind for he never found time to send her another Yet she had studied with all her most anxious care to write him an answer such a one as might not lessen her understanding which he had often praised in his esteem  Ah William even with less anxiety your beating ambitious heart panted for the admiration of an attentive auditory when you first ventured to harangue in publicWith far less hope and fear great as yours were did you first address a crowded court and thirst for its approbation  on your efforts than Hannah sighed for your approbation when she took a pen and awkwardly scrawled over a sheet of paper Near twenty times she beganbut to a gentlemanand one she loved like Williamwhat could she dare to say Yet she had enough to tell if shame had not interposedor if remaining confidence in his affection had but encouraged her  Overwhelmed by the first and deprived of the last her hand shook her head drooped and she dared not communicate what she knew must inevitably render her letter unpleasing and still more depreciate her in his regard as the occasion of encumbrance and of injury to his moral reputation  Her free her liberal her venturous spirit subdued intimidated by the force of affection she only wrote  SIR  I am sorry you have so much to do and should be ashamed if you put it off to write to me I have not been at all well this winterI never before  passed such a one in all my life and I hope you will never know such a one yourself in regard to not being happyI should be sorry if you didthink I would rather go through it again myself than you should I long for the summer the fields are so green and every thing so pleasant at that time of the year I always do long for the summer but I think never so much in my life as for this that is comingthough sometimes I wish that last summer had never come Perhaps you wish so tooand that this summer would not come either  Hope you will excuse all faults as I never learnt but one month  Your obedient humble servant H P  CHAPTER XXIV  SUMMER arrivedand lords and ladies who had partaken of all the dissipation of the town whom operahouses gaminghouses and various other houses had detained whole nights from their peaceful home were now poured forth from the metropolis to imbibe the wholesome air of the farmer and peasant and disseminate in return moral and religious principles  Among the rest Lord and Lady Bendham strenuous opposers of vice in the poor and gentle supporters of it in the rich never played at cards or had concerts on a Sunday in the village where the poor were spies  he  there never gamed or drank except in privateand  she  banished from her doors every female of sullied character Yet poverty and idiotism are not the samethe poor can hear can talk sometimes can reflectservants will tell their equals how they live in townlisteners will smile and  shake their headsand thus hypocrisy instead of cultivating destroys every seed of moral virtue  The arrival of Lord Bendham's family at Anfield announced to the village that the dean's would quickly follow Rebecca's heart bounded with joy at the prospectPoor Hannah felt a sinking a foreboding tremor that wholly interrupted the joy of  her  expectationsShe had not heard from William for five tedious monthsshe did not know whether he loved or despisedwhether he thought of or had forgotten her Her reason argued against the hope that he loved heryet hope still subsistedshe would not abandon herself to despair while there was doubtshe "had frequently been deceived from the appearance of circumstances and perhaps he might come all kindnessperhapseven not like her the less for that indisposition which had changed her bloom to paleness and the sparkling of her eyes to a pensive languor"  Henry's sensations on his return to Anfield were the selfsame as Rebecca's were  sympathy in thought sympathy in affection sympathy in virtue made them so As he approached near the little village he felt more light than usual He had committed no trespass there dreaded no one's reproach or enquiries but his arrival might prove at least to one object the cause of rejoicing  William's sensations were the reverse of these In spite of his ambition and the flattering view of accomplishing all to which it aspired he often as they proceeded on their journey envied the gaiety of Henry and felt an inward monitor that told him "he must first act like Henry to be as happy"  His intended marriage was still to the families of both parties except to the heads of the houses a profound secret Neither the servants nor even Henry had received the slightest intimation of the designed alliance and this to William was matter of some comfort  When men submit to act in contradiction to their principles nothing is so precious as a secret In their estimation to have their conduct  known  is the essential  mischiefwhile it is hid they fancy the sin but half committed and to the moiety of a crime they reconcile their feelings till in progression the whole when disclosed appears trivial He designed that Hannah should receive the news from himself by degrees and in such a manner as to console her or at least to silence her complaints and with the wish to soften the something like regret which he still felt on the prudent necessity of yielding her up when his marriage should take place he promised to himself some intervening hours of private meetings which he hoped would produce satiety  While Henry flew to Mr Rymer's house with a conscience clear and a face enlightened with gladness while he met Rebecca with openhearted friendship and frankness that charmed her foul to peaceful happiness William skulked around the cottage of Hannah dreading detection and when towards midnight he found the means to obtain the company of the sad inhabitant he grew so impatient at her tears and sobs at the  delicacy with which she withheld her caresses that he burst into bitter upbraidings at her coyness and at length without discovering the cause of her peculiar agitation and reserve abruptly left her vowing "never to see her more"  As he turned away his heart even congratulated him "that he had made so discreet a use of his momentary disappointment as thus to shake her off at once without farther explanation or excuse"  She ignorant and illiterate as she was knew enough of her own heart to judge of his and to know that such violent affections and expressions above all such a sudden heartbreaking manner of departure were not the effects of love not even of humanity She felt herself debased by a ruffianyet still having loved him when she thought him otherwise the blackest proof of the deception could not erase a sentiment formed while she was deceived  She passed the remainder of the night in anguishbut with the cheerful morning some cheerly thoughts arose She  thought "perhaps William by this time had found himself to blamehad conceived the cause of her grief and her distant behaviour and had pitied her"  The next evening she waited with anxious heart for the signal that had called her out the foregoing nightin vain she watched counted the hours and the stars and listened to the nightly stillness of the fields around they were not disturbed by the tread of her loverDaylight came the sun rose in its splendour William had not been near her and it shone upon none so miserable as Hannah  She now considered his word "never to see her more" as solemnly passedshe heard anew the impressive the implacable tone in which the sentence was pronounced and could look back on no late token of affection on which to found the slightest hope that he would recall it  Still reluctant to despairin the extremity of grief in the extremity of fear for an approaching crisis that must speedily arrive she after a few days had elapsed trusted a neighbouring peasant  with a letter to deliver to Mr Norwynne in private  This letter unlike the last was dictated without the hope to pleaseno pains were taken with the style no care in the formation of the lettersthe words flowed from necessity strong necessity guided her hand  SIR  I BEG your pardonpray don't forsake me all at oncesee me one time moreI have something to tell youit is what I dare tell nobody elseand what I am ashamed to tell youyet pray give me a word of advicewhat to do I don't knowI then will part if you please never to trouble you never any morebut hope to part friendspray do if you pleaseand see me one time more  Your obedient H P  These incorrect inelegant lines produced this immediate reply  TO HANNAH PRIMROSE  I have often told you that my honour is as dear to me as my lifemy word is a part of that honouryou heard me say  I would never see you again  I shall keep my word  CHAPTER XXV  WHEN the dean's family had been at Anfield about a monthOne misty morning such as portends a sultry day as Henry was walking swiftly through a thick wood on the skirts of the parish he suddenly started on hearing a distant groan expressive as he thought both of bodily and mental pain He stopped to hear it repeated that he might pursue the sound He heard it again and though now but in murmurs yet as the tone implied excessive grief he directed his course to that part of the wood from whence it came  As he advanced in spite of the thick fog he discerned the appearance of a female scudding away on his approach His eye was fixed on this object and regardless where he placed his feet soon he shrunk back with horror on perceiving they had nearly trod upon a newborn infant lying on the grounda lovely male child entered on a world where  not one preparation had been made to receive him  "Ah" cried Henry forgetting the person who had fled and with a smile of compassion on the helpless infant "I am glad I have found youyou give more joy to me than you have done to your hapless parents Poor dear" continued he while he took off his coat to wrap it in "I will take care of you while I liveI will beg for you rather than you shall wantbut first I will carry you to those who at present can do more for you than myself"  Thus Henry said and though while he inclosed the child carefully in his coat and took it in his arms But about to walk his way with it an unlucky query struck him  where he should go  "I must not take it to the dean's" he cried "because Lady Clementina will suspect it is not nobly and my uncle will suspect it is not lawfully born Nor must I take it to Lord Bendham's for the selfsame reasonthough could it call Lady Bendham mother this whole village nay the whole country round would  ring with rejoicings for its birth How strange" continued he "that we should make so little of human creatures that one sent among us wholly independent of his own high value becomes a curse instead of a blessing by the mere accident of worthless circumstances"  He now after walking out of the wood peeped through the folds of his coat to look again at his chargeHe started turned pale and trembled to behold what in the surprise of first seeing the child had escaped his observation Around its little throat was a cord entwined by a slipping noose and drawn half wayas if the trembling hand of the murderer had revolted from its dreadful office and he or she had left the infant to pine away with nakedness and hunger rather than  see  it die  Again Henry wished himself joy of the treasure he had found and more servently than before for he had not only preserved one fellow creature from death but another from murder  Once more he looked at his charge and was transported to observe upon its serene  brow and sleepy eye no traces of the dangers it had passedno trait of shame either for itself or its parentsno discomposure at the unwelcome reception it was likely to encounter from a proud worldHe now slipped the fatal string from its neck and by this affectionate disturbance causing the child to cry he ran but he scarce knew whither to convey it to a better nurse  He at length found himself at the door of his dear Rebeccafor so very happy Henry felt at the good luck which had befallen him that he longed to bestow a part of the blessing upon her he loved  He sent for her privately out of the house to speak to himWhen she came  "Rebecca" said he looking around that no one observed him "Rebecca I have brought you something you will like"  "What is it" she asked  "You know Rebecca that you love deserted birds strayed kittens and motherless lambsI have brought something more pitiable than any of these  Go and get a cap and a little gown and then I will give it you"  "A gown" exclaimed Rebecca "If you have brought me a monkey much as I should esteem any present from  you  indeed I cannot touch it"  "A monkey" repeated Henry almost in angerthen changing the tone of his voice exclaimed in triumph  "It is a child"  On this he gave it a gentle pinch that its cry might confirm the pleasing truth he spoke  "A child" Repeated Rebecca in amaze  "Yes and indeed I found it"  "Found it"  "Indeed I did The mother I fear had just forsaken it"  "Inhuman creature"  "Nay hold Rebecca I am sure you will pity her when you see her childyou then will know she must have loved itand will consider how much she certainly had suffered before she left it to perish in a wood"  "Cruel" Once more exclaimed Rebecca  "Oh Rebecca perhaps had she possessed a home of her own she would have given it the best place in ithad she possessed money she would have dressed it with the nicest careor had she been accustomed to disgrace she would have gloried in calling it hers But now as it is it is sent to us to you and me Rebecca to take care of"  Rebecca soothed by Henry's compassionate eloquence held out her arms and received the important parceland as she kindly looked in upon the little stranger  "Now are not you much obliged to me" said Henry "for having brought it to you I know no one but yourself to whom I would have trusted it with pleasure"  "Much obliged to you" repeated Rebecca with a very serious face "if I did but know what to do with itwhere to put itwhere to hide it from my father and sisters"  "Oh any where"returned Henry "It is very goodit will not cryBut if they should discover it they will take it from you prosecute the wretched mother and send the child to the workhouse"  "I will do all I can" replied Rebecca "and I know I can take milk from the dairy and bread from the pantry without its being missed or my father much the poorerBut if it should cry"  That instant they were interrupted by the appearance of the stern curate at a little distanceHenry was obliged to run swiftly away while Rebecca returned by stealth into the house with her innocent burthen  CHAPTER XXVI  THERE is a word in the vocabulary more bitter more direful in its import than all the restReader if poverty if disgrace if bodily pain even if slighted love is your unhappy fate kneel and bless heaven for its beneficent influence so that you are not tortured with the anguish of  remorse  Deep contrition for past offences had long been the punishment of unhappy Hannah but till the day she brought her child into the world  remorse  had been averted From that day life became an insupportable load for all reflection was torture To thinkmerely to think was to suffer excruciating agonyyet never before was  thought  so intrusiveit haunted her in every spot in all societiessleep was no sheltershe never slept but her racking dreams told her"she had slain her infant"  They presented to her view the naked innocent whom she had longed to press  to her bosom while she lifted up her hand against its lifeThey laid before her the smiling babe whom her eyeballs strained to behold once more while her feet hurried her away for ever  Often had Hannah by the winter's fire listened to tales of ghostsof the unceasing sting of a guilty conscienceoften had she shuddered at the recital of murdersoften had she wept over the story of the innocent put to death and stood aghast that the human mind could perpetrate the heinous crime of assassination  From the tenderest passion the most savage impulse may ariseIn the deep recesses of fondness sometimes is implanted the root of crueltyand from loving William with unbounded lawless affection she found herself depraved so as to become the very object that could most of all excite her own horror  Still at delirious intervals that passion which like a fatal talisman had enchanted her whole soul held out the delusive prospect that"William might yet relent"for though she had for ever discarded the idea of peace she could not  force herself to think but that again blest with his society she should at least for the time that he was present taste the sweet cup of "forgetfulness of the past" for which she so ardently thirsted  "Should he return to me" she thought in those paroxysms of delusion "I would to  him  unbosom all my guilt and as a remote a kind of innocent accomplice in my crime his sense his arguments ever ready in making light of my sins might afford a respite to my troubled conscience"  While thus she unwittingly thought and sometimes watched through the night starting with convulsed rapture at every sound because it might possibly be the harbinger of him  he  was busied in carefully looking over marriage articles fixing the place of residence with his destined bride or making love to her in formal processYet Hannah vaunthe sometimes thought on theehe could not witness the folly the weakness the vanity the selfishness of his future wife without frequently comparing her with thee When equivocal words and prevaricating  sentences fell from her lips he remembered with a sigh thy candourthat open sincerity which dwelt upon thy tongue and seemed to vie with thy undisguised features to charm the listener even beyond the spectator While Miss Sedgeley eagerly grasped at all the presents he offered he could not but call to mind that Hannah's declining hand was always closed and her looks forbidding every time he proffered such disrespectful tokens of his love" He recollected the softness that beamed from Hannah's eyes the blush on her face at his approach while he could never discern one glance of tenderness from the niece of Lord Bendham and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was nearly as disgusting as the illconducted artifice with which she attempted gentleness and love  But all these impediments were only observed as trials of his fortitudehis prudence could overcome his aversion and thus he valued himself upon his manly firmness  'Twas now that having rid himself by Hannah's peevishness most honourably  of all future ties to her and the day of his marriage with Miss Sedgeley being fixed that Henry with the rest of the house learnt what to them was newsThe first dart of Henry's eye upon William when in his presence he was told of it caused a reddening on the face of the latter he always fancied Henry saw his thoughts and he knew that Henry in return would give him  his  On the present occasion no sooner were they alone and Henry began to utter them than William charged him  "Not to dare to proceed for that too long accustomed to trifle the time was come when serious matters could alone employ his time and when men of approved sense must take place of friends and confidents like him"  Henry replied "The love the sincerity of friends I thought were their best accomplishments those I possess"  "But you do not possess knowledge"  "If that is knowledge which has of late estranged you from all who bear you a sincere affection which imprints every day more and more upon your features  the marks of gloomy inquietude am I not happier in my ignorance"  "Do not torment me with your ineffectual reasoning"  "I called at the cottage of poor Hannah the other day" returned Henry "Her father and mother were eating their homely meal alone and when I asked for their daughter they wept and saidHannah was not the girl she had been"  William cast his eyes on the floor  Henry proceeded"They said a sickness which they feared would bring her to the grave had preyed upon her for some time past They had procured a doctor but no remedy was found and they feared the worst"  "What worst" cried William now recovered from the effect of the sudden intelligence and attempting a smile "Do they think she will die And do you think it will be for love We do not hear of these deaths often Henry"  "And if  she  die who will hear of  that  No one but those interested to conceal the cause and thus it is that dying for love becomes a phenomenon"  Henry would have pursued the discourse farther but William impatient on all subjects except where his argument was the better retired from the controversy crying out "I know my duty and want no instructor"  It would be unjust to William to say he did not feel for Hannah's reported illnesshe felt during that whole evening and part of the next morningbut business pleasures new occupations and new schemes of future success crowded to dissipate all unwelcome reflections and he trusted in her youth her health her animal spirits and above all in the folly of the gossips' story of  dying for love  as a surety for her life and a safeguard for his conscience  CHAPTER XXVII  THE child of William and Hannah was secreted by Rebecca in her own chamber a garret and at some distance from where her sisters slept There she administered to all its wants viewed almost with the joy of a mother its health its promised life and in a short time found she loved her little gift better than any thing on earth except the giver  Henry called the next day and the next and many succeeding times in hopes of an opportunity to speak alone with Rebecca to enquire concerning her charge and consult when and how he could privately relieve her from her trust as he now meant to procure a nurse for wages In vain he called or lurked around the housefor near five weeks all the conversation he could obtain with her was in the company of her sisters who beginning to observe his preference his marked attention to her indulged  their envy and resentment at the contempt shown to their charms by watching her steps when he was away and her every look and whisper while he was present  For five weeks then he was continually thwarted in his expectation of meeting her alone and at the end of that period the whole design he had to accomplish by such a meeting was rendered abortive  Though Rebecca had every day and night with strictest caution locked her bedchamber door and covered the crevices and every aperture of her room through which sound might more easily proceed though she had surrounded the infant's head with pillows to obstruct all noise from his crying yet one unlucky night the strength of his voice encreasing with his age he was heard by the maid who slept in the opposite garret  Not meaning to injure her young mistress the servant next morning simply related to the family what sounds had struck her ear during the night but from what part of the house they came she would  not undertake directly to sayAt first she was ridiculed "for supposing herself awake when in reality she must be dreaming" But stedfastly persisting in what she had said and Rebecca's confusion giving much colour to the improbable tale her chamber was searched by her sisters the infant discovered and brought down to their father  That account which Henry had given Rebecca "of his having found the child" and which her own sincerity joined to the faith she had in his word made her receive as truth she now felt would be heard by the present auditors with contempt even with indignation as a falsehoodHer affright is better to be conceived than described  Dragged by her sisters along with the child before the curate his crimsoned face knit brow and thundering voice struck with terror her very soulInnocence is not always a protection against fearsometimes less bold than guilt  In her father and sisters she saw she knew the suspicious partial cruel boisterous natures by whom she was to be  judged and timid gentle oppressed she fell trembling on her knees and could only articulate  "Forgive me"  The curate would not listen to this supplication till she had replied to his question"Whose child is this"  She replied "I do not know"  Questioned louder and with more violence still "How the child came there and whose it was" She felt the improbability of the truth still more forcibly than before and dreaded some immediate peril from her father's rage should she dare to relate an apparent lieshe paused to think upon a more probable tale than the real oneand as she hesitated shook in every limbwhile her father exclaimed  "I understand the cause of this terrorFrom your infancy I have predicted that some fatal catastrophe would befall youI never loved you like my other childrenI never had the causeyou were always unlike the restand I knew your sate would be calamitousbut the very worst of my forebodings did not  come to thisso young so guilty and so artfultell me this instant are you married"  Rebecca answered "No"  The sisters lifted up their hands  The father continued"Vile prostitute I thought as muchStill I will know the father of this child"  She cast up her eyes to heaven and firmly vowed she "did not know herselfnor who the mother was"  "This is not to be borne" exclaimed the curate in fury "Persist in this and you never see my face again Both your child and you I'll turn out of my house instantly unless you confess your crime and own the father"  Curious to know this secret the sisters went up to Rebecca with seeming kindness and"Conjured her to spare her father still greater grief and her own and her child's public infamy by acknowledging herself its mother and naming the man who had seduced her"  Emboldened by this insult from her own sex Rebecca now began to declare the simple truthBut no sooner had she  said that"The child was the gift of a young man who had found it" than her sisters burst into laughter and her father into fresh fits of rage  Once more the women offered their advice"To confess and be forgiven"  Once more the father raved  Beguiled by solicitations and terrified by threats she at length felt inclined to take the mother's share of the infant but was at a loss to whom to give the father's She thought that Henry had entailed on himself the best right to the charge but she loved him and could not bear the idea of accusing him falsely  While with agitation in the extreme she thus deliberated the proposition again was put  "Whether she would trust to the mercy of her father by confessing or draw down his immediate vengeance by denying her guilt"  She made choice of the formerand with tears and sobs "Owned herself the mother of the boy"  But still"Who is the father"  Again she shrunk from the question and fervently implored"To be spared on that point"  Her petition was rejected with vehemence and the curate's rage encreased till she acknowledged  "Henry was the father"  "I thought so" Exclaimed all her sisters at the same time  "Villain" cried the curate "The dean shall know before this hour is expired the baseness of the nephew whom he supports upon charity he shall know the misery the grief the shame he has brought upon me and know how unworthy he is of his protection"  "Oh have mercy on him" cried Rebecca as she still knelt to her father "Do not ruin him with his uncle for he is the best of creatures"  "Ay ay we always saw how much she loved him" Cried her sisters  "Wicked undone girl" said the clergyman his rage now subsiding and tears supplying its place "you have drawn a curse upon us allyour sisters' reputation will be stampt with the colour of  yoursmy good name will sufferbut that is trivialyour soul is lost to virtue to religion to shame"  "No  indeed  " cried Rebecca "If you will but believe me"  "Do not I believe you Have not you confessed"  "You would not pretend to unsay what you have said" cried her eldest sister "that would be making things worse"  "Go go out of my sight" said her father "Take your child with you to your chamber and never let me see either of you againI do not turn you out of my doors to day because I gave you my word I would not if you revealed your shamebut by tomorrow I will provide some place for your reception where neither I nor any of your relations shall ever see or hear of you more"  Rebecca made an effort to cling around her father and once more to declare her innocence but her sisters interposed and she was taken with her reputed son to the chamber where the curate had sentenced her to remain till she quitted his house for ever  CHAPTER XXVIII  THE curate in the soldier of his mind scarce felt the ground he trod as he hasted to the dean's to complain of his wrongs His name procured him immediate admittance into the libraryand the moment the dean appeared the curate burst into tearsThe cause being required of such "very singular marks of grief" Mr Rymer described himself "as having been a few months ago the happiest of parents but that his peace and that of his whole family had been destroyed by Mr Henry Norwynne the dean's nephew"  He now entered into a minute recital of Henry's frequent visits there and of all that had occurred in his house that morning from the suspicion that a child was concealed under his roof to the confession made by his youngest daughter of her fall from virtue and of her betrayer's name  The dean was astonished shocked and rouzed to anger he vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew and "blessing himself in a virtuous son whose wisdom and counsel were his only solace in every care" sent for William to communicate with him on the unhappy subject  William came all obedience and heard with marks of amazement and indignation the account of such black villany In perfect sympathy with Mr Rymor and his father he allowed no "punishment could be too great for the seducer of innocence the selfish invader of a whole family's repose"  Nor did William here speak what he did not thinkhe merely forgot his own conduct or if he did recal it to his mind it was with some fair interpretation in his own behalf such as selflove ever supplies to those who wish to cheat their conscience  Young Henry being sent for to appear before this triumvirate he came with a light step and a chearful face But on the charge against him being exhibited  his countenance changedyet only to the expression of surprise He boldly asserted his innocence plainly told the real fact and with a deportment so perfectly unembarrassed that nothing but the asseverations of the curate "that his daughter had confessed the whole" could have rendered the story Henry told suspected although some of the incidents he related were of no common kind But Mr Rymer's charge was an objection to his veracity too potent to be overcome and the dean exclaimed in rage  "We want not your avowal of your guiltthe mother's evidence is testimony sufficient"  "The virtuous Rebecca is not a mother" Said Henry with firmness  William here like Rebecca's sisters took Henry aside and warned him not to "Add to his offence by denying what was proved against him"  But Henry's spirit was too manly his affection too sincere not to vindicate the chastity of her he loved even at his own peril He again and again protested "she was virtuous"  "Let her instantly be sent for" said the dean "and this madman confronted with her" Then adding that as he wished every thing might be conducted with secrecy he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occasion he desired William to draw up the form of an oath which he would administer as soon as she arrived  A man and horse were immediately dispatched to bring Rebecca William drew up an affidavit as his father had directed him  in Rebecca's name solemnly protesting she was a mother and Henry the father of her child  and now the dean suppressing till she came the warmth of his anger spoke thus calmly to Henry  "Even supposing that your improbable tale of having found this child and all your declarations in respect to it were true still you would be greatly criminal what plea can you make for not having immediately revealed the circumstance to me or some other proper person that the real mother might be detected and punished for her design of murder"  "In that perhaps I was to blame" returned Henry "but whoever the mother was I pitied her"  "Compassion on such an occasion was ill placed" Said the dean  "Was I wrong Sir to pity the child"  "No"  "Then how could I feel for  that  and yet divest myself of all feeling for its mother"  "Its mother" exclaimed William in anger "She ought to have been immediately pursued apprehended and committed to prison"  "It struck me cousin William" replied Henry "that the father was most deserving a prison the poor woman had abandoned only  one  the man in all likelihood had forsaken  two  "  William was pouring execrations "on the villain if such there could be" when Rebecca was announced  Her eyes were halfclosed with weeping deep confusion overspread her face and her tottering limbs could hardly support her to the awful chamber where the dean her father and William sat in  judgment whilst her beloved Henry stood arraigned as a culprit by her false evidence  Upon her entrance her father first addressed her and said in a stern threatening yet feeling tone "Unhappy girl answer me before all presentHave you or have you not owned yourself a mother"  She replied stealing a fearful look at Henry"I have"  "And have you not" asked the dean "owned that Henry Norwynne is the father of your child"  She seemed as if she wished to expostulate  The curate raised his voice"Have you or have you not"  "I have" she faintly replied  "Then here" cried the dean to William "read that paper to her and take the Bible"  William read the paper which in her name declared a momentous falsehood he then held the book in form while she looked like one distractedwrung her hands and was near sinking to the earth  At the moment the book was lifted up to her lips to kiss Henry rushed to her"Stop" he cried "Rebecca do not hurt your future peace do not be terrified into the commission of a crime which hereafter will distract your delicate conscience My confession will be a testimony equal to your oathwill render it needlessand here I acknowledge that all you have asserted is truth"  "Surprising audacityComplicated villany" exclaimed the deanthen added "Henry Norwynne your first guilt is so enormous your second in stedfastly denying it so base this last conduct so unaccountable That from the present hour you must never dare to call me relation or to consider my house as your home"  William in unison with his father exclaimed "Indeed Henry your actions merit this punishment"  Henry answered with firmness "Inflict what punishment you please"  "With the dean's permission then" said the curate "you must marry my daughter"  Henry started"Marry her Marry Rebecca Do you pronounce that as a punishment It would be the greatest blessing providence could bestowBut how are we to live My uncle is too much offended ever to be my friend again and in this country people of a certain class are so educated they cannot exist without the assistance or what is called the patronage of others when that is withheld they steal or starve Heaven protect Rebecca from such misfortuneSir to the curate do you but consent to support her a year or two longer and in that time I will learn some occupation that shall raise me to the eminence of maintaining both her and myself without one obligation or one inconvenience to another"  Rebecca exclaimed "Oh you have saved me from such a weight of sin that my future life would be too happy passed as your slave"  "No my dear Rebecca return to your father's house return to slavery but for a few years more and the rest of your life I will make free"  "And can you forgive me"  "I can love you and in that is comprised every thing that is kind"  The curate who bating a few passions and a few prejudices was a man of some worth and feeling had felt in the midst of her distress though the result of crimes that he loved this neglected daughter better than he had before conceived and he now agreed "to take her home for a time provided she were relieved from the child and the matter so hushed up that it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other daughters  The dean did not degrade his consequence by consultations of this nature but having penetrated as he imagined into the very bottom of this intricate story and issued his mandate against Henryas a mark that he took no farther concern in the matter he proudly walked out of the room without uttering another word  William as proudly and as silently followed  The curate was inclined to adopt the  manners of such great examplesbut selfinterest some affection to Rebecca and concern for the character of his family made him wish to talk a little more with Henry who now repeated what he had said respecting his marriage with Rebecca and promised "to come the very next day in secret and deliver her from the care of the infant and the suspicion that would attend her nursing it"  "But above all" said the curate "procure your uncle's pardon for without that without his protection or the protection of some other rich man to marry to obey God's ordinance  increase and multiply  is to want food for yourself and your offspring"  CHAPTER XXIX  THOUGH this unfortunate occurrence in the curate's family was according to his own phrase "to be hushed up" yet certain persons of his of the dean's and of Lord Bendham's house immediately heard and talked of it Among these Lady Bendham was most of all shocked and offended she "never could bear to hear Mr Rymer either pray or preach againhe had not conducted himself with proper dignity either as a clergyman or a fatherhe should have imitated the dean's example in respect to Henry and have turned his daughter out of doors"  Lord Bendham was less severe on the seduced but had no mercy on the seducer"a vicious youth without one accomplishment to endear vice"For vice Lord Bendham thought with some philosophers might be most exquisitely pleasing in a pleasing garb "But this  youth sinned without elegance without one particle of wit or an atom of good breeding"  Lady Clementina would not permit the subject to be mentioned a second time in her hearingextreme delicacy in woman she knew was bewitching and the delicacy she displayed on this occasion went so far that she "could not even intercede with the dean to forgive his nephew because the topic was too gross for her lips to name even in the ear of her husband  Miss Sedgeley though on the very eve of her bridal day with William felt so tender a regard for Henry that often she thought "Rebecca happier in disgrace and poverty blest with the love of him than she was likely to be in the possession of friends and fortune with his cousin"  Had Henry been of a nature to suspect others of evil or had he felt a confidence in his own worth such a passion as this young woman's would soon have disclosed its existence but he regardless of any attractions of Miss Sedgeley equally supposed  he had none in her eyes and thus fortunately for the peace of all parties this prepossession ever remained a secret except to herself  So little did William conceive that his clownish cousin could rival him in the affections of a woman of fashion that he even slightly solicited his father "that Henry might not be banished from the house at least till after the following day when the great festival of his marriage was to be celebrated"  But the dean refused and reminded his son "That he was bound both by his moral and religious character in the eyes of God and still more in the eyes of men to shew lasting resentment of iniquity like his"  William acquiesced and immediately delivered his cousin the dean's "wishes for his amendment" and a letter of recommendation procured from Lord Bendham to introduce him on board a man of war where he was told "he might hope to meet with preferment according to his merit as a sailor and a gentleman"  Henry pressed William's hand on parting  wished him happy in his marriageand supplicated as the only favour he would implore an interview with his uncleto thank him for all his former kindness and see him for the last time  William repeated this petition to his father but with so little energy that the dean did not grant it He felt himself compelled to resent that reprobate character in which Henry had appeared and he feared"lest the remembrance of his last parting from his brother might on taking a formal leave of that brother's son reduce him to some tokens of weakness that would illbecome his dignity and just displeasure"  He sent him his blessing with money to convey him to his shipand Henry quitted his uncle's house in a flood of tears to seek first a new protectress for his little soundling and then to seek his fortune  CHAPTER XXX  THE wedding day of Mr William Norwynne with Miss Caroline Sedgeley arrivedand on that day the bells of every parish surrounding that in which they lived joined with their own in celebration of the blissful union Flowers were strewed before the newmarried pair and favours and ale made many a heart more gladsome than that of either bridegroom or bride  Upon this day of ringing and rejoicing the bells were not muffled nor was conversation on the subject withheld from the ear of Hannah She heard like her neighbours and sitting on the side of her bed in her little chamber suffered under the cottage roof as much affliction as ever visited a palace  Tyrants who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads of their fellow creatures can call their murders "religion justice attention to the good  of mankind"poor Hannah knew no sophistry to calm  her  conscienceshe felt herself a harlot and a murderera slighted a deserted wretch bereft of all she loved in this world all she could hope for in the next  She complained bitterly of illness nor could the entreaties of her father and mother prevail on her to share in the sports of this general holidayAs none of her humble visitors suspected the cause of her more than ordinary indisposition they endeavoured to divert it with an account of every thing they had seen at church"What the bride wore how joyful the bridegroom looked and all the little signs of that complete happiness which they conceived was for certain tasted  Hannah who before this event had at moments suppressed the agonising sting of guilt in the faint prospect of her lover one day restored on this memorable occasion lost every glimpse of hope and was weighed to the earth with an accumulation of despair  Where is the degree in which the sinner stops Unhappy Hannah the first time you permitted indecorous familiarity from a man who made you no promise who gave you no hope of becoming his wife who profest nothing beyond those fervent though slender affections which attach the rake to the wantonthe first time you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers into tenderness and constancythe first time you descended from the character of purity you rushed imperceptibly on the blackest crimes The more sincerely you loved the more you plunged in dangerfrom one ungoverned passion proceeded a second and a third In the fervency of affection you yielded up your virtueIn the excess of fear you stained your conscience by the intended murder of your childand now in the violence of grief you meditatewhatto put an end to your existence by your own hand  After casting her thoughts around anxious to find some little bud of comfort on which to fix her longing eye she beheld  in the total loss of William nothing but a wide waste an extensive plain of anguish"How am I to be sustained through this dreary journey of life" she exclaimedUpon this question she felt more poignantly than ever her loss of innocenceinnocence would have been her supportbut in place of this best prop to the afflicted guilt flashed on her memory every time she flew for aid to reflection  At length from horrible rumination a momentary alleviation came"But one more step in wickedness" she triumphantly said "and all my shame all my sufferings are over" She congratulated herself upon the lucky thoughtwhen but an instant after the tears trickled down her face for the sorrow her death her sinful death would bring to her poor and beloved parentsShe then thought upon the probability of a sigh it might draw from William and the pride the pleasure of that little tribute counterpoised every struggle on the side of life  As she saw the sun decline "When you rise again" she thought "when  you peep bright tomorrow morning into this little room to call me up I shall not be here to open my eyes upon a hateful dayI shall no more regret that you have waked meI shall be sound asleep never to wake again in this wretched worldnot even the voice of William would then awake me  While she found herself resolved and evening just come on she hurried out of the house and hastened to the fatal wood the scene of her dishonourthe scene of meditated murderand now the intended scene of suicide  As she walked along between the closeset trees she saw at a little distance the spot where William first made love to her and where at every appointment he used to wait her coming She darted her eye away from this place with horrorbut after a few moments of emotion she walked slowly up to itshed tears and pressed with her trembling lips that tree against which he was accustomed to lean while he talked to herShe felt an inclination to make this the spot to die inbut her preconcerted and the less  frightful death of throwing herself into a pool on the other side of the wood induced her to go onwards  Presently she came near the place where her child and William's was exposed to perishHere she started with a sense of the most atrocious guilt and her whole frame shook with the dread of an approaching an omnipotent judge to sentence her for murder  She halted appalled Aghast Undetermined whether to exist longer beneath the pressure of a criminal conscience or die that very hour and meet her final condemnation  She proceeded a few steps farther and beheld the very ivybush close to which her infant lay when she left him exposedand now from this minute recollection all the mother rising in her soul she saw as it were her babe again in its deserted state and bursting into tears of bitterest contrition and compassion she cried  "As I was merciless to  thee  my child thy father has been pitiless to  me  As I abandoned  thee  to die with cold and  hunger he has forsaken and has driven  me  to die by selfmurder"  She now fixed her eager eyes on the distant pond and walked more nimbly than before to rid herself of her agonising sense  Just as she had nearly reached the wishedfor brink she heard a footstep and saw by the glimmering of a clouded moon a man approaching She turned out of her path for fear her intentions should be guessed at and thwarted but still as she walked another way her eye was wishfully bent towards the water that was to obliterate her love and her remorseobliterate for ever William and his child  It was now that Henrywho to prevent scandal had stolen at that still hour of night to rid the curate of the incumbrance so irksome to him and take the foundling to a woman whom he had hired for the chargeit was now that Henry came up with the child of Hannah in his arms carefully covered all over from night's dew  "Hannah is it you" cried Henry at a little distance "Where are you going thus late"  "Home Sir" Said she and rushed among the trees  "Stop Hannah" he cried "I want to bid you farewelltomorrow I am going to leave this part of the country for a long timeSo God bless you Hannah" Saying this he stretched out his arm to shake her by the hand  Her poor heart trusting that his blessing for want of more potent offerings might perhaps at this tremendous crisis ascend to heaven in her behalf she stopt returned and put out her hand to take his  "Softly" said he "don't wake my childthis spot has been a place of danger for himfor underneath this very ivybush it was that I found him"  "Found what" Cried Hannah with a voice elevated to a tremulous scream  "I will not tell you replied Henry "for no one I have ever yet told of it would believe me"  "I will believe you I will believe you" She repeated with tones yet more impressive  "Why then" said Henry "only five weeks ago"  "Ah" shrieked Hannah  "What do you mean" Said Henry  "Go on" She articulated in the same voice  "Why then as I was passing this very place I wish I may never speak truth again if I did not find"here he pulled aside the warm rug in which the infant was wrapt"this beautiful child"  "With a cord"  "A cord was round its neck"  "'Tis minethe child is mine'tis minemy childI am the mother and the murdererI fixed the cord while the ground shook under mewhile flashes of fire darted before my eyeswhile my heart was bursting with despair and horrorBut I stopt shortI did not draw the nooseI had a moment of strength and I ran away I left him livinghe is living nowescaped from my handsand I am no longer ashamed  but overcome with joy that he is mine I bless you my dear for saving his lifefor giving him to me againfor preserving my life as well as my child's"  Here she took her infant pressed it to her lips and to her bosom then bent to the ground clasped Henry's knees and wept upon his feet  He could not for a moment doubt the truth of what she saidher powerful yet broken accents her convulsive starts even more than her declaration convinced him  She now rose from the earth in haste and stealing quick on one side postponed farther gratitude to Henry for the performance of the most endearing office of a mother The child greedily received from her bosom the food till then untastedand on this feeling more exquisitely the tender the proud prerogative of a maternal parent she uttered with sighs of transport  "Now I am as rich as happy as your fatheras blest as his bridefor I experience the joy of a conscience relieved from a deadly weightand I have something  to lovesomething on which to pour that fund of affection which he rejects"  "Good heaven" cried Henry "and this is my cousin William's child"  "But your cousin does not know it" Said she "I never told himhe was not kind enough to embolden metherefore do not blame  him  for  my  sinhe did not know of my wicked designshe did not encourage me"  "But he forsook you Hannah"  "He never said he would not He always told me he could not marry me"  "Did he tell you so at his first private meeting"  "No"  "Nor at the second"  "No nor yet at the third"  "When was it he told you so"  "I forget the exact timebut I remember it was on that very evening when I confest to him"  "What"  "That he had won my heart"  "Why did you confess it"  "Because he asked me and said it would make him happy if I would say so"  "Cruel dishonourable"  "Nay do not blame himhe cannot help  not  loving me no more than I can help  loving  him"  Henry rubbed his eyes  "Bless me you weepI always heard that you were brought up in a savage country but I suppose it is a mistake it was your cousin William"  "Will not you apply to him for the support of your child" Asked Henry  "If I thought he would not be angry"  "AngryI will write to him on the subject if you will give me leave"  "But do not say it is by my desire Do not say I wish to trouble himI would sooner beg than be a trouble to him"  "Why are you so delicate"  "It is for my own sakeI wish him not to hate me"  "Then thus you may secure his respectI will write to him and let him  know all the circumstances of your case I will plead for his compassion on his child but assure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare except only to me who knew of your previous acquaintance who is the father"  To this Hannah consented but when Henry offered to take from her the infant and carry him to the nurse he had engaged to this she would not consent  "Do you mean then to acknowledge him yours" Henry asked  "Nothing shall force me to part from him I will keep him and let my neighbours judge of me as they please"  Here Henry caught at a hope he feared to name before "You will then have no objection" said he "to clear an unhappy girl to a few friends with whom her character has suffered by becoming at my request his nurse"  "Most gladly I will clear any one so that I do not accuse the father"  "You give me leave then in your name to tell the whole story to some particular friends my cousin William's part in it alone excepted"  "I do"  "Henry now cried "God bless you" with greater fervour than when he spoke it beforeand he hoped the nig  t was nearly gone that the time might be so much the shorter before Rebecca should be reinstated in the esteem of her father and of all those who had misjudged her  "God bless  you  " said Hannah still more fervently as she walked with unguided steps towards her home for her eyes never wandered from the precious object that caused her unexpected return  CHAPTER XXXI  HENRY rose early in the morning and flew to the curate's house with more than even his usual thirst of justice to clearinjured innocence to redeem from shame her whom he loved With eager haste he toldthat he had sound the mother whose fall from virtue Rebecca overcome by confusion and threats had taken on herself  Rebecca rejoicedbut her sisters shook their headsand even the father seemed to doubt  Confident in the truth of his story Henry persisted so boldly in his affirmations that if Mr Rymer did not entirely believe what he said he secretly hoped the dean and other people might therefore he began to imagine he could possibly shake from  his  family the present stigma whether or no it belonged to any other  No sooner was Henry gone than Mr Rymer waited on the dean to report what  he had heard and he frankly attributed his daughter's false confession to the compulsive methods he had adopted in charging her with the offence upon this statement Henry's love to her was also a solution of his inconsistent conduct on that singular occasion  The dean immediately said"he would put the matter beyond all doubt for he would that moment send for the present reputed mother and if she acknowledged the child he would instantly commit her to prison for the attempt of putting it to death  The curate applauded the dean's sagacity a warrant was issued and Hannah brought prisoner before the grandfather of her child  She appeared astonished at the peril in which she found herself Confused also with a thousand inexpressible sensations which the dean's presence inspired she seemed to prevaricate in all she utteredAccused of this she was still more disconcertedsaid and unsaidconfessed herself the mother of the infant but declared she did not knowthen owned  she  did  know the name of the man who had undone her but would never utter itAt length she cast herself on her knees before the father of her betrayer and supplicated "he would not punish her with severity as she most penitently confessed her fault so far as it related to herself"  While Mr and Mrs Norwynne just entered on the honeymoon were sitting side by side enjoying with peace and with honour conjugal society poor Hannah threatened reviled and sinking to the dust was hearing from the mouth of William's father the enormity of those crimes to which his son had been accessaryShe saw the mittimus written that was to convey her into a prisonsaw herself delivered once more into the hands of constables before her resolution of concealing the name of William in her story left herShe now overcome with affright and thinking she should expose him still more in a public court if hereafter on her trial she should be obliged to name himshe now humbly asked the dean to hear a few words she had to say  in privatewhere she promised she "would speak nothing but the truth"  This was impossible he said"No private confessions before a magistrate All must be done openly"  She urged again and again the same requestit was denied more peremptorily than at first On which she said  "Then Sir forgive me since you force me to it if I speak before Mr Rymer and those men what I would for ever have kept a secret if I couldOne of your family is my child's father"  "Any of my servants" cried the dean  "No"  "My nephew"  "No one who is nearer still"  "Come this way" said the dean "I  will  speak to you in private  It was not that the dean as a magistrate distributed partial decrees of pretended justicehe was rigidly faithful to his trusthe would not inflict punishment on the innocent or let the guilty escapebut in all particulars of refined or coarse treatment he would alleviate or aggravate according to the rank of the  offender He could not feel that a secret was of equal importance to a poor as to a rich personand while Hannah gave no intimation but that her delicacy rose from fears for herself she did not so forcibly impress the dean with an opinion that it was a case which had pressing cause for a private conference as when she boldly said "a part of  his  family very near to him was concerned in her tale"  The final result of their conversation in an adjoining room wasa charge from the dean in the words of Mr Rymer "to hush the affair up" and his promise that the infant should be immediately taken from her and "she should have no more trouble with it"  "I have no trouble with it" Replied Hannah "It is now all my comfort and I cannot part from it"  "Why you inconsistent woman did you not attempt to murder it"  "That was before I had suckled it"  "It is necessary you should give it upit must be sent some miles offand then the whole circumstance will be soon forgotten"  "  I  shall never forget it"  "No matteryou must give up the childDo not most of our first women of quality part with their children"  "Women of quality have other things to loveI have nothing else"  "And would you occasion my son and his newmade bride the shame and the uneasiness"  Here Hannah burst into a stood of tears and being angrily asked by the dean "why she blubbered so"  "Ihave had shame and uneasiness" She replied wringing her hands  "And you deserve themthey are the sure attendants of crimes such as yoursIf you allured and entrapped a young man like my son"  "I am the youngest by five years" Said Hannah  "Well well repent" returned the dean "repent and resign your child Repent and you may yet marry an honest man who knows nothing of the matter"  "And repent too" Asked Hannah  Not the insufferable ignorance of young Henry when he first came to England  was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than the rustic folly of poor Hannah's uncultured replies He at last in an offended and determined manner told her  "That if she would resign the child and keep the father's name a secret not only the child should be taken care of but she herself might perhaps receive some favours but if she persisted in her imprudent folly she must expect no consideration on her own account nor should she be allowed for the maintenance of the boy a sixpence beyond the stated sum for the poor man's unlawful offspring Hannah resolving not to be separated from her infant bowed resignation to this last decree and terrified at the loud words and angry looks of the dean after being regularly discharged stole to her home where the smiles of her infant and the caresses she lavished on it repaid her for the sorrows she had just suffered for its sake  Let it here be observed that the dean on suffering Hannah to depart without putting in force the law against her as he  had threatened did nothing as it were  behind the curtain  He openly and candidly owned to Mr Rymer his clerk and the two constables who were attending"That an affair of some little gallantry in which he was extremely sorry to say his son was rather too nearly involved required in consideration of his recent marriage and an excellent young woman's his bride's happiness that it should not be publicly talked ofTherefore he had thought proper only to reprimand the hussey and sent her about her business"  The curate assured the dean"That upon this and upon all other occasions which should would or  could  occur he owed to his judgment as his superior implicit obedience"  The clerk and the two constables most properly said"His honour was a gentleman and of course must know better how to act than they"  CHAPTER XXXII  IT was not the pleasure of a mother that Hannah experienced which could make her insensible to the sorrow of a daughter  Her parents had received the stranger child along with a fabricated tale she told "of its appertaining to another" without the smallest suspicion but by the secret diligence of the curate and the nimble tongues of his elder daughters the report of all that had passed on the subject of this unfortunate infant soon circulated through the village and Hannah in a few weeks had seen her parents pine away in grief and shame at her loss of virtue  She perceived the neighbours avoid or openly sneer at  her  but that was littleshe saw them slight her aged father and mother upon her account and she now took the resolution rather to perish for want in another part of the country  than live where she was known and so entail a curse on all who loved her She slightly hoped too that by disappearing from the town and neighbourhood some little reward might be allowed her for her banishment by the dean's family In that she was deceivedNo sooner was she gone indeed than her guilt was forgotten but with her guilt her wants The dean and his family rejoiced at her and her child's departure but as this mode she had chosen chanced to be no specified condition in the terms offered to her they did not think they were bound to pay her for it and while she was too fearful and bashful to solicit the dean too proud forlorn as she was to supplicate his son they both concluded she "wanted for nothing" for to be poor and too delicate to complain they deemed incompatible  To heighten the sense of her degraded friendless situation she knew that Henry had not been unmindful of his promise to her but that he had applied to his cousin in her and his child's behalf for he had acquainted her that William's  answer was"all obligations on  his  part were now undertaken by his father for Hannah having chosen in a fit of malignity upon his marriage to apprise the dean of their former intercourse such conduct had for ever cancelled all attention due from him to her or to her child beyond what its bare maintenance exacted"  In vain had Henry explained to him the predicament in which poor Hannah was involved before she consented to reveal her secret to his father William was happy in an excuse to rid himself of a burthen and he seemed to believe what he wished were truethat she had forfeited all claim to his farther notice  Henry informed Hannah in as gentle terms as possible of this unkind reception of his efforts in her favour for she excited his deepest compassionPerhaps our  own  misfortunes are the cause of our pity for others even more than  their  ills and Henry's present sorrows had softened his heart to peculiar sympathy in woe He had unhappily found that the ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of Rebecca was likely to deprive  him of the blessing of her ever becoming his wife For the dean chagrined that his son was at length proved an offender instead of his nephew submitted to the temptation of punishing the latter while he forgave the former He sent for Henry and having coldly congratulated him on his and Rebecca's innocence represented to him the impropriety of marrying the daughter of a poor curate and laid his commands on him "never to harbour such an intention more" Henry found this restriction so severe that he would not promise obedience but on his next attempt to visit Rebecca he met a positive repulse from her father who signified to him "that the dean had forbid him to permit their farther acquaintance" and the curate declared"that for his own part he had no will judgment or faculties but that he submitted in all things to the superior clergy"  At the very time young Henry had received the proposal from Mr Rymer of his immediate union with his daughter and the dean had made no objection  Henry waved the happiness for the time present and had given a reason why he wished it postponed The reason he then gave had its weight but he had another concealed of yet more importMuch as he loved and looked forward with rapture to that time when every morning every evening and all the day he should have the delight of Rebecca's society still there was one other wish nearer his heart than thisone desire which for years had been foremost in his thoughts and which not even love could cradicate He longed he pined to know what fate had befallen his father Provided he were living he could conceive no joy so extreme as that of seeing him If he were dead he was anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he owed by satisfying his affectionate curiosity in every circumstance of the sad event  While a boy he had frequently expressed these sentiments to both his uncle and his cousin sometimes they apprised him of the total improbability of accomplishing his wishes at other times when they saw the disappointment weigh heavy  on his mind they bade him"wait till he was a man before he could hope to put his designs in execution" He did wait But on the very day he arrived at the age of twentyone he made a vow"that to gain intelligence of his father should be the first act of his free will"  Previously to this time he had made all the enquiries possible whether any new adventure to that part of Africa in which he was bred was likely to be undertaken Of this there appeared to be no prospect till the intended expedition to Sierra Leone was announced which favoured his hope of being able to procure a passage among those adventures so near to the island on which his father was or had been prisoner as to obtain an opportunity of visiting it by stealth  Fearing contention or the being dissuaded from his plans if he communicated them he formed them in private kept them secretly and his imagination filled with the kindness the tenderness the excess of fondness he had experienced from his father beyond any other person in the world he had thought with delight  on the separation from all his other kindred to pay his duty to him or to his revered memory Of late indeed there had been an object introduced to his acquaintance from whom it was bitter to part but his designs had been planned and firmly fixed before he knew Rebecca nor could he have tasted contentment even with her at the expence of his piety to his father  In the last interview he had with the dean Henryperceiving that his disposition towards him was not less severe than when a few days before he had ordered him on board a vesselfound this the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the sleet to Sierra Leone His uncle expressed surprise but immediately gave him a sum of money such as he thought might defray his expences and as he gave it by his willingness his look and his accent seemed to say "I foresee this is the last you will ever require"  Young William though a very dutiful son was amazed when he heard of  Henry's project "as the serious and settled resolution of a man"  Lady Clementina Lord and Lady Bendham and twenty others "wished him a successful voyage" and thought no more about him  It was for Rebecca alone to feel the loss of Henryit was for a mind like hers alone to know his worthnor did this last proof of it the quitting her for one who claimed by every tie a preference lessen him in her esteemWhen by a message from him she became acquainted with his design she valued him the more for this observance of his duty much as it interfered with her happinessthe more she regretted his loss and the more anxiously prayed for his return which in the following letter written just before his departure he taught her to hope for  MY DEAR REBECCA  I Do not tell you I am sorry to part from youyou know I amand you know all I have suffered since your  father denied me permission to see you  But perhaps you do not know the hopes I enjoy and which bestow on me a degree of peaceand those I am eager to tell you  I hope Rebecca to see you againI hope to return to England and overcome every obstacle to our marriageand then in whatever station we are placed I shall consider myself as happy as it is possible to be in this worldI feel a conviction that you would be happy too  Some persons I know estimate happiness by fine houses gardens and parksothers by pictures horses money and various things wholly remote from their own speciesbut when I wish to ascertain the real felicity of any rational man I always enquire  whom he has to love  If I find he has nobodyor does not love those he haseven in the midst of all his profusion of finery and grandeur I pronounce him a being in deep adversity In loving  you I am happier than my cousin William even though I am obliged to leave you for a time  Do not be afraid you should grow old before I returnage can never alter you in my regard It is your gentle nature your unaffected manners your easy cheerfulness your clear understanding the sincerity of all your words and actions that have gained my heart and while you preserve charms like these you will be dearer to me with white hairs and a wrinkled face than any of your sex who not possessing all these qualities possess the youth and bloom of perfect beauty  You will esteem me too I trust though I should return on crutches and with my poor father whom I may be obliged to maintain by daily labour  I will employ all my time during my absence in the study of some art that may enable me to support you both provided heaven will bestow  two such blessings on me In the cheering thought that it will be so and in that only I have the courage my dear dear Rebecca to say to you  Farewell H NORWYNNE  CHAPTER XXXIII  BEFORE Henry could receive a reply to his letter the fleet in which he sailed put to sea on the voyage  By his absence not only Rebecca was deprived of the friend she loved but poor Hannah lost a kind and compassionate adviser Her parents too both sickened and both died in a short time afterand now wholly friendless and in her little exile where she could only hope for toleration not being known she was contending with suspicion rebuffs disappointments and various other ills that might have made the most harsh of her Anfield persecutors feel compassion for her could they have witnessed the throbs of her heart and have viewed the state of her agonising mind  Still there are few persons whom providence afflicts beyond the limits of  all  consolationfew cast so low as not to  feel pride on  certain  occasionsand Hannah felt a comfort and a dignity in the thoughtthat she had both a mind and a body capable of sustaining every hardship her destiny might inflict rather than submit to the disgrace of soliciting William's charity a second time  This determination was put to a variety of trialsIn vain she offered herself to the strangers of the village in which she was accidentally cast as a servanther child her dejected looks her broken sentences a wildness in her eye a kind of bold despair that at times spread over her features her imperfect story who and what she was prejudiced all those to whom she applied and after thus travelling to several small towns and hamlets the only employer she could obtain was a farmer and the only employment to tend and feed his cattle while his men were in the harvest tilling the ground or at some other labour which required at that time peculiar expedition  Though Hannah was born of peasants yet having been an only child and of  industrious parents she had been nursed with tenderness and delicacy ill suited to her present occupationbut she endured it with patience and the most laborious part would have seemed light to her could she have dismissed the reflectionwhat it was that had reduced her to it  Soon her tender hands became hard and rough her fair skin burnt and yellow so that when on a Sunday she has looked in the glass she has started back as if it were some other face she saw instead of her own But this loss of beauty gave her no regretwhile William did not see her it was of little purport to her whether she were beautiful or hideous On the features of her child only she now looked with joythere she fancied she saw William at every glanceand in the fond imagination felt at times every happiness short of seeing  him  By herding solely with the brute creation she and her child were allowed to live together and this was a state she preferred to the society of human creatures who would have separated her  from what she loved so tenderlyAnxious to retain a place in which she possessed such a blessing care and attention to her humble office caused her master to prolong her stay through all the winterthen during the spring she attended his yeaning sheepin the summer watched them as they grazedand thus season after season passed till her young son could afford her assistance in her daily work  He now could charm her with his conversation as well as with his looksa thousand times in the transports of parental love she has pressed him to her bosom and thought with an agony of horroron her foul intent to destroy what was now so dear so necessary to her existence  Still the boy grew more like his fatherin one resemblance alone he failedHe loved Hannah with an affection totally distinct from the pitiful and childish gratification of his own selflovehe never would quit her side for all the tempting offers of toys or moneynever would eat of rarities given to him till  Hannah took a partnever crossed her will however contradictory to his ownnever saw her smile that he did not laughnor did she ever weep but he wept too  CHAPTER XXXIV  FROM the mean subject of oxen sheep and peasants we return to personages  i e  persons of rank and fortune The bishop who was introduced in the beginning of this work but who occupied very small space there is now mentioned here merely that the reader may know he is at present in the same state as his writingsdying and that his friend the dean is talked of as the most likely successor to his dignified office  The dean most assuredly had a strong friendship for the bishop and now most assuredly wished him to recoverand yetwhen he reflected on the success of his pamphlet a few years back and of many which he had written since on the very same subject he could not but think "That he had more righteous pretensions to fill the vacant seat of his much beloved and reverend friend should fate ordain it to be vacated than any other  man" and he knew that it would not take one moment from that friend's remaining life should he exert himself and with all due management to obtain the elevated station when  he  should be no more  In presupposing the death of a friend the deanlike many other virtuous men"always supposed him going to a better place" With perfect resignation therefore he waited whatever change might happen to the bishop ready to receive him with open arms if he recovered or equally ready in case of his dissolution to receive his dignities  Lady Clementina displayed her sensibility and feeling for the sick prelate by the disgusting extravagance of hysteric fits except at those times when she talked seriously with her husband upon the injustice which she thought would be done to him and to his many pamphlets and sermons if he did not immediately rise to the episcopal honour  "Surely dean" said she "should you be disappointed upon this occasion you will write no more books for the good of your country"  "Yes I will" he replied "but the next book I write for the good of my country shall be very different nay the very reverse of those I have already written"  "How dean would you show yourself changed"  "No but I will show that my country is changed"  "What since you produced your last work only six weeks ago"  "Great changes may occur in six days" replied the dean with a threatening accent "and if I find things  have  taken a new and improper turn I will be the first to expose it"  "But before you act in this manner my dear surely you will wait"  "I will wait till the See is disposed of to another" Said he  He did waitThe bishop diedThe dean was promoted to the See of * * * and wrote a folio on the prosperity of our happy country  CHAPTER XXXV  WHILE the bishop and his son were sailing before prosperous gales on the ocean of life young Henry was contending with adverse winds and many other perils on the watery oceanyet still his distresses and dangers were less than those which Hannah had to encounter on land The sea threatens an untimely death the shore menaces calamities from which death is a refuge  The afflictions Hannah had already experienced could just admit of aggravationthe addition occurred  Had the good farmer who made her the companion of his flocks and herds lived till now till now she might have been secure from the annoyance of human kind but thrown once more upon society she was unfit to sustain the conflict of decorum against depravityHer master her patron her preserver was dead and hardly as she had earned the  pittance she received from him she sound it surpassed all her power to obtain the like again Her doubtful character her capacious mind her unmethodical manners were still ill suited to the nice precision of a country housewife and as the prudent mistress of a family sneered at her pretensions she in her turn scorned at the narrowminded mistress of a family  In her enquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting reproaches of discretion she was informed "that London was the only private corner where guilt could be secreted undisturbedand the only public place where in open day it might triumphantly stalk attended by a train of audacious admirers"  There was a charm to the ear of Hannah in the name of London that thrilled through her soulWilliam lived in Londonand she thought that while she retired to some dark cellar with her offences he probably would ride in state with his and she at humble distance might sometimes catch a glance of him  As difficult as to eradicate infanity from a mind once possessed so difficult it is to erase from the lover's breast the deep impression of a  real  affection Coercion may prevail for a short interval still love will rage again Not all the ignominy Hannah experienced in the place where she now was without a homenot the hunger which she at times suffered and even at times saw her child endurenot every inducement for going to London or motive for quitting her present desolate station had the weight to affect her choice so much asIn London she should live nearer William in the present spot she could never hope to see him again but there she might chance to pass him in the streets she might pass his door unobserved every day might enquire about him of his inferior neighbours who would be unsuspicious of the cause of her curiosityFor these gratifications she should breathe another airfor these she could bear all hardships which London threatened and for these she took a threeweeks' journey to that perilous town on foot cheering as  she walked along her innocent and wearied companion  William In your luxurious dwelling Possessed of coffers filled with gold Relations friends clients joyful around you Delicious viands and rich wines upon your sumptuous board Voluptuousness displayed in every apartment of your habitationContemplate for a moment Hannah your first love with her son your first and only child walking through frost and snow to London with a foreboding fear on the motherthat they both may perish for the want of a friend when arrived  But no sooner did Hannah find herself within the smoke of the metropolis than the old charm was renewed and scarcely had she refreshed her child at the poor inn at which she stopped than she enquiredhow far it was to that part of the town where she knew William resided  She received for answer "about two miles"  Upon this information she thought that she would keep in reserve till some  new sorrow befell her the consolation of passing his door perchance of seeing him which must ever be an alleviation of her grief It was not long before she had occasion for even more substantial comfort She soon found she was not likely to obtain a service here more than in the country Some objected that she could not make caps and gowns some that she could not preserve and pickle some that she was too young some that she was too pretty and all declined accepting her till at last a citizen's wife on condition of her receiving but half the wages usually given took her as a servant of all work  In romances and in some plays there are scenes of dark and unwholesome mines wherein the labourer works during the brightest day by the aid of artificial light There are in London kitchens equally dismal though not quite so much exposed to damp and noxious vapours In one of these under ground hid from the cheerful light of the sun poor Hannah was doomed to toil from morning till night subjected to the command  of a dissatisfied mistress who not estimating as she ought the misery incurred by serving her constantly threatened her servants "with a dismission" at which the unthinking wretches would tremble merely from the sound of the wordsfor to have reflectedto have considered what their purport was"to be released from a dungeon relieved from continual upbraidings and vile drudgery" must have been a subject of rejoicingand yet because these good tidings were delivered as a menace custom had made the poor creatures fearful of the consequence So death being described to children as a disaster even poverty and shame will start from it with affright when had it been pictured as it is a good it would be feared by few and many many would welcome it with gladness  All the care of Hannah to please her fear of offending her toilsome days her patience her submission could not prevail on her mistress to retain her one hour after by chance she had heard "that Hannah was the mother of a child that  she wished it should be kept a secret and that she stole out now and then to visit him"  Hannah with swimming eyes and an almost breaking heart left a placewhere to have lived one hour would have plunged any fine lady in the deepest grief  CHAPTER XXXVI  HANNAH was driven from service to serviceher deficiency in the knowledge of a mere drudge or her lost character pursued her wherever she went and at length becoming wholly destitute she gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not the least objection  In one of those habitations where continual misery is dressed in continual smiles where extreme of poverty is concealed by extreme of show where wine dispenses mirth only by dispensing forgetfulness and where female beauty is so cheap so complying that while it inveigles it disgusts the man of pleasurein one of those houses to attend upon its wretched inhabitants Hannah was hiredHer feelings of rectitude submitted to those of hungerHer principles of virtue which the loss of virtue had not destroyed received a shock when she engaged to be  the abettor of vice from which her delicacy morality and religion shrunk butpersons of honour and of reputation would not employ her was she then to perish That perhaps was easy to resolvebut she had a child to leave behind A child from whom to part for a day was a tormentYet before she submitted herself to a situation that filled her mind with a kind of loathing horror often she paced up and down the street in which William lived looked wistfully at his house and sometimes lost to all her finer feelings of independent pride thought of sending a short petition to himbut at the idea of a repulse and of that frowning brow which she knew William  could  dart on her she preferred death or the most degrading life to the trial  It was long since that misfortune and dishonour had made her callous to the good or ill opinion of all the world except  his  and the fear of drawing upon her his encreased contempt was still at the crisis of applying so powerful that she found she dared not even hazard a  reproof from him in the person of his father whose rigour she had now more than once experienced in the frequent harsh messages conveyed to her with the poor stipend for her boy  Awed by the rigid and pious character of the new bishop the rising honours and growing reputation of his son she mistook the appearance of moral experience for moral excellence itself and felt her own unworthiness even to become the supplicant of those great men  Day after day she watched those parts of the town through which William's chariot was accustomed to drivebut to see the carriage was all to which she aspireda feeling not to be described forced her to cast her eyes upon the earth as it drew near to herand when it had passed she beat her breast and wept that she had not seen  him  Impressed with the superiority of others and her own abject and disgustful state she cried"Let me herd with those who won't despise melet me only see faces whereon I can look without confusion and terrorlet me associate with wretches  like myself rather than force my shame before those who are so good they can but scorn and mock at me"  With a mind thus languishing for sympathy in disgrace she entered a servant in the house just now described There accomplishing the fatal proverb against "  evil communications  " she had not the fortitude to be an exception to the general ruleThat pliant disposition which had yielded to the licentious love of William stopped to still baser prostitution in company still more depraved  At first she shuddered at those practices that she saw at those conversations that she heard and blest herself that poverty not inclination had caused her to be a witness of such things and had condemned her in the vile abode to be a servant rather than in the lower rank of mistressUse softened those horrors every dayat length selfdefence the fear of ridicule and the hope of favour induced her to adopt that very conduct from which her heart revolted  In her sorrowful countenance and fading charms there yet remained attraction  for many visitorsand she now submitted to the mercenary profanations of love more odious as her mind had been subdued by its most sacred and endearing joys  While incessant regret whispered to her "she ought to have endured every calamity rather than this" she thus questioned her nice sense of wrong"Why why respect myself while no other respects me Why set a value on my own feelings when no one else does"  Degraded in her own judgment she doubted her own understanding when it sometimes told her she had deserved better treatmentfor she felt herself a fool in comparison with her learned seducer and the rest who despised her "And why" she continued "should I ungratefully persist to contemn women who alone are so kind as to accept me a companion Why refuse conformity to their customs while none of my sex besides will admit me to their society a partaker of theirs"  In speculation these arguments appeared reasonable and she pursued their dictates  but in the practice of the life in which she plunged she proved the fallacy of the system and at times tore her hair with frantic sorrowthat she did not continue in the midway of guilt and so preserve some little portion of selfapprobation to recompence her in a small degree for the total loss of the esteem of all the virtuous world  But she had now gone too far to recede Could she have now recalled her innocence even that part she brought with her to London experience would have taught her to have given up her child and have lived once more with the brute creation and apart from him rather than to have mingled with her present society Now alas the time for flying was pastall prudent choice was overeven all reflection was gone for everor only admitted on compulsion when it imperiously forced its way amidst the scenes of tumultuous mirth of licentious passion of distracted riot shameless effrontery and wild intoxicationwhen it  would  force its wayeven through the walls of a brothel  CHAPTER XXXVII  IS there a reader so little experienced in the human heart so forgetful of his own as not to feel the possibility of the following fact  A series of uncommon calamities had been for many years the lot of the elder Henrya succession of prosperous events had fallen to the share of his brother WilliamThe one was the envy while the other had the compassion of all who thought about them For the last twenty years William had lived in affluence bordering upon splendour his friends his fame his fortune daily encreasing while Henry throughout that very period had by degrees lost all he loved on earth and was now existing apart from civilised societyand yetduring those twenty years where William knew one happy moment Henry tasted hundreds  That the state of the mind and not outward circumstances is the nice point on which happiness depends is but a  quaint remark but that intellectual power should have the force to render a man discontented in extraordinary prosperity such as that of the present bishop or contented in his brother's extreme of adversity requires illustration  The first great affliction to Henry was his brother's ingratitude but reasoning on the frailty of man's nature and the power of man's temptations he found excuses for William which made him support the treatment he had received with more tranquillity than William's proud mind supported his brother's marriageHenry's indulgent disposition made him less angry with William than William was with him  The next affliction Henry suffered was the loss of his beloved wifethat was a grief which time and change of objects gradually alleviated while William's wife was a permanent grief to him her puerile mind her talking vanity her affected virtues soured his domestic comfort and in time he had suffered more painful moments from her society than his brother had experienced even from the death of her he loved  In their children indeed William was the happiesthis son was a pride and pleasure to him while Henry never thought upon  his  without lamenting his loss with bitter anguish But if the elder brother had in this instance the advantage still Henry had a resource to overbalance this article Henry as he lay imprisoned in his dungeon and when after his punishment was remitted he was again allowed to wander and seek his subsistence where he would in all his tedious walks and solitary restingplaces during all his lonely days and mournful nights had  this resource  to console him  "I never did an injury to any one never was harsh severe unkind deceitful I did not merely confine myself to do my neighbour no harm I strove to serve him"  This was the resource that cheered his sinking heart amidst gloomy deserts and a barbarous people lulled him to peaceful slumber in the hut of a savage hunter and in the sound of the lion's roar at times impressed him with a sense of happiness and made him contemplate with  a longing hope the retribution of a future world  The bishop with all his comforts had no comfort like thishe had  his  solitary reflections too but they were of a tendency the reverse of these"I used my brother ill" was a secret thought of most powerful influenceit kept him waking upon his safe and commodious bed was sure to recur with every misfortune by which he was threatened to make his fears still stronger and came with invidious stabs upon every successful event to take from him a part of his joyIn a word it was  conscience  that made Henry's years pass happier than William's  But though comparatively with his brother William was the less happy man yet his selfreproach was not of such magnitude for an offence of that atrocious nature as to banish a certain degree of happiness and a sensibility to the smiles of fortune from his breastnor was Henry's selfacquittal of such exquisite kind as to chase away the feeling of his desolate situation  As he fished or hunted for his daily dinner many a time in full view of his prey a sudden burst of sorrow at his fate a sudden longing for some dear society for some friend to share his thoughts for some kind shoulder on which to lean his head for some companion to partake of his repast would make him instantaneously desist from his pursuit cast him on the ground in a fit of anguish till a shower of tears and his  conscience  came to his relief  It was on a sultry morning when after pleasant dreams during the night he had walked with more than usual perception of his misery that sitting upon the bench his wishes and his looks all bent on the sea towards his native land he thought he saw a sail swelling before an unexpected breeze  "Sure I am dreaming still" he cried "This is the very vessel I saw last night in my sleepOh what cruel mockery that my eyes should so deceive me"  Yet though he doubted he leaped upon his feet in transportheld up his hands stretched at their length in a  kind of ecstatic joyand as the glorious fight approached was near rushing into the sea to meet it  For a while hope and fear kept him in a state bordering on distraction  Now he saw the ship making for the shore and tears flowed for the grateful prospect Now it made for another point and he vented shrieks and groans from the disappointment  It was at those moments while hope and fear thus possessed him that the horrors of his abode appeared more than ever frightfulInevitable afflictions must be borne but that calamity which admits the expectation of relief that is afterwards denied is insupportable  After a few minutes passed in dreadful uncertainty which enhanced the wishedfor happiness the ship evidently drew near the landa boat was launched from herand while Henry now upon his knees wept and prayed fervently for the event a youth sprang from the barge on the strand rushed towards him and falling on his neck then at his feet exclaimed"My father oh my father"  William Dean Bishop What are your honours what your riches what all your possessions compared to the happiness the transport bestowed by this one sentence on your poor brother Henry  CHAPTER XXXVIII  THE crosses at land and the perilous events at sea had made it now several years since young Henry first took the vow of a man no longer dependent on the will of another to seek his father His fatigues his dangers were well recompensed Instead of weeping over a silent grave he had the inexpressible joy to receive a parent's blessing for his labours Yet the elder Henry though living was so changed in person that his son would scarcely have known him in any other than the favourite spot which the younger keeping in memory every incident of his former life knew his father had always chosen for his morning contemplations and where previously to his coming to England he had many a time kept him company It was to that particular corner of the island that the captain of the ship had generously ordered they should steer out of the general  route to gratify the filial tenderness he expressed But scarcely had the interview between the father and the son taken place than a band of natives whom the appearance of the vessel had called from the woods and hills came to attack the invaders The elder Henry had no friend with whom he wished to shake hands at his departure the old negro servant who had assisted in young Henry's escape was dead and he experienced the excessive joy of bidding adieu to a place without one regret for all he left behind  On the night of that day whose morning had been marked by peculiar sadness at the louring prospect of many exiled years to come he slept on board an English vessel with Englishmen his companions and his son his beloved sonwho was still more dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his rescuehis attentive servant and most affectionate friend  Though many a year passed and many a rough encounter was destined to the lot of the two Henrys before they saw the  shores of Europe yet to them to live or to die together was happiness enougheven young Henry for a time asked for no greater blessingbut the first glow of filial ardor over he called to mind "Rebecca lived in England" and every exertion which love founded on the highest reverence and esteem could dictate he employed to expedite a voyage the end of which would be crowned by the sight of her  CHAPTER XXXIX  THE contrast of the state of happiness between the two brothers was nearly resembled by that of the two cousinsthe riches of young William did not render him happy nor did the poverty of young Henry doom him to misery His affectionate heart as he had described in his letter to Rebecca loved  persons  rather than  things  and he would not have exchanged the society of his father or the prospect of her hand and heart for all the wealth and finery of which his cousin William was the master  He was right Young William though he viewed with contempt Henry's inferior state was far less happy than heHis marriage had been the very counterpart of his father's and having no child to create affection to his home his study was the only relief from the domestic incumbrance his wife and though by unremitting application there joined to  the influence of the potent relations of the woman he hated he at length arrived at the summit of his ambitious desires still they poorly repaid him for the sacrifice he had made in early life of every tender disposition  Striding through a list of rapid advancements in the profession of the law at the age of thirtyeight he found himself raised to preferment such as rarely falls to the share of a man of his short experiencehe found himself invested with a judge's robe and gratified by the exalted office curbed more than ever that aversion which her want of charms or sympathy had produced against the partner of his honours  While William had thus been daily rising in fortune's favour poor Hannah had been daily sinking deeper and deeper under fortune's frowns till at last she became a midnight wanderer through the streets of London soliciting or rudely demanding money of the passing stranger Sometimes hunted by the watch she affrighted fled from street to street from portico to porticoand once unknowing  in her fear which way she hurried she found her trembling knees had sunk and her wearied head was reclined against the pillars that guarded William's door  At the sudden recollection where she was a swell of passion composed of horror of despair and love gave reanimated strength to her failing limbs and regardless of her pursuers' steps she ran to the centre of the street and looking up to the windows of the house cried "Ah there he sleeps in quiet in peace in easehe does not even dream of mehe does not care how the cold pierces or how the people persecute meHe does not thank me for all the lavish love I have borne him and his childHis heart is so hard he does not even recollect that it was he who brought me to ruin"  Had these miseries common to the unhappy prostitute been alone the punishment of Hannahhad her crimes and sufferings ended in distress like this her story had not perhaps been selected for a public recital for it had been no other  than the customary history of thousands of her sex But Hannah had a destiny yet more severeUnhappily she was endowed with a mind so sensibly alive to every joy and every sorrow to every mark of kindness every token of severity so liable to excess in passion that once perverted there was no degree of error from which it would with firmness revolt  Taught by the conversation of the dissolute poor with whom she now associated or by her own observation on the worldly reward of elevated villany she began to suspect "that dishonesty was only held a sin to secure the property of the rich and that to take from those who did not want by the art of stealing was less guilt than to take from those who did want by the power of the law"  By false yet seducing opinions such as these her reason estranged from every moral and religious tie her necessities urgent the reluctantly aceepted the proposal to mix with a band of practised sharpers and robbers and become an accomplice in negotiating bills forged on a country banker  But though ingenious in arguments to excuse the deed before its commission in the act she had the dread of some uncontrovertible statement on the other side of the question Intimidated by this conviction she was the veriest bungler in her vile professionand on the alarm of being detected while every one of her confederates escaped and absconded she alone was seizedwas arrested for issuing notes they had fabricated and committed to the provincial jail about fifty miles from London where the crime was perpetrated to take her trial forlife or death  CHAPTER XL  THE day at length is come on which Hannah shall have a sight of her beloved WilliamShe who has watched for hours near his door to procure a glimpse of him going out or returning home who has walked miles to see his chariot pass she now will behold him and he will see her by the command of the laws of their countryThose laws that will deal with rigour towards her in this one instance are still indulgent  The time of the assizes at the countytown in which she is imprisoned is arrivedthe prisoners are demanded at the shirehallthe jail doors are openedthey go in sad processionThe trumpet soundsit speaks the arrival of the judgeand that judge is William  The day previous to her trial Hannah had read in the printed calendar of the prisoners his name as the learned justice before whom she was to appear For a  moment she forgot her perilous state in the excess of joy which the still unconquerable love she bore to him permitted her to taste even on the brink of the graveAfterreflection made her check those worldly transports as unfit for the present solemn occasion But alas to her earth and William were so closely united that till she forsook the one she could never cease to think without the contending passions of hope of fear of joy of love of shame and of despair on the other  Now fear took place of her first immoderate joyshe feared that although much changed in person since he had seen her and her real name now added to many an  alias  yet she feared that some wellknown glance of the eye turn of the action or accent of speech might recall her to his remembrance and at that idea shame overcame all her other sensationsfor still she retained pride in respect to  his  opinion to wish him not to know Hannah was that wretch she felt she wasOnce a ray of hope beamed on her "that if he knew her if he recognised  her he might possibly befriend her cause"and life bestowed through William's friendship seemed a precious objectBut again that rigorous honour she had often heard him boast that firmness to his word of which she had fatal experience taught her to know he would not for any improper compassion any unmanly weakness forfeit his oath of impartial justice  In meditations such as these she passed the sleepless night  When in the morning she was brought to the bar and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgmentseat of William imagination could not form two figures or two situations more incompatible with the existence of former familiarity than the judge and the culpritand yet these very persons had passed together the most blissful moments that either ever tastedThose hours of tender dalliance were now present to  her  mind  His  thoughts were more nobly employed in his high officenor could the haggard face hollow eye desponding countenance and meagre person of  the poor prisoner once call to his memory though her name was uttered among a list of others that she had assumed his former youthful lovely Hannah  She heard herself arraigned with trembling limbs and downcast looksand many witnesses had appeared against her before she ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge She then gave one fearful glance and discovered William unpitying but beloved William in every feature It was a face she had been used to look on with delight and a kind of absent smile of gladness now beamed on her poor wan visage  When every witness on the part of the prosecutor had been examined the judge addressed himself to her  "What defence have you to make"  It was William spoke to HannahThe sound was sweetthe voice was mild was soft compassionate encouragingIt almost charmed her to a love of lifenot such a voice as when William last add  essed her when he left her undone and pregnant vowing "never to see or speak to her more"  She could have hung upon the present words for ever She did not call to mind that this gentleness was the effect of practice the art of his occupation which at times is but a copy by the unfeeling from his benevolent brothers of the bench In the present judge tenderness was not designed for the culprit's consolation but for the approbation of the auditors  There were no spectators Hannah by your side when last he parted from youif there had the awful William had been awed to marks of pity  Stunned with the enchantment of that wellknown tongue directed to her she stood like one just petrifiedall vital power was suspended  Again he put the question and with these additional sentences tenderly and emphatically delivered"Recollect yourselfHave you no witnesses No proof in your behalf"  A dead silence followed these questions  He then mildly but forcibly added"What have you to say"  Here a flood of tears burst from her eyes which she fixed earnestly upon him as if pleading for mercy while she faintly articulated  "Nothing my Lord"  After a short pause he asked her in the same forcible but benevolent tone  "Have you no one to speak for your character"  The prisoner answered  "No"  A second gush of tears followed this reply for she called to mind by  whom  her character had first been blasted  He summed up the evidenceand every time he was compelled to press hard upon the proofs against her she shrunk and seemed to stagger with the deadly blowwrithed under the weight of  his  minute justice more than from the prospect of a shameful death  The jury consulted but a few minutesthe verdict was  "Guilty"  She heard it with composure  But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head and rose to pronounce  her sentenceshe started with a kind of convulsive motionretreated a step or two back and lifting up her hands with a scream exclaimed  "Oh not from  you  "  The piercing shriek which accompanied these words prevented their being heard by part of the audience and those who heard them thought little of their meaning more than that they expressed her fear of dying  Serene and dignified as if no such exclamation had been uttered William delivered the fatal speech ending with"Dead dead dead"  She fainted as he closed the period and was carried back to prison in a swoon while he adjourned the court to go to dinner  CHAPTER XLI  IF unaffected by the scene he had witnessed William sat down to dinner with an appetite let not the reader conceive that the most distant idea had struck his mindof his ever having seen much less familiarly known the poor offender whom he had just condemned Still this forgetfulness did not proceed from the want of memory for HannahIn every peevish or heavy hour passed with his wife he was sure to think of heryet it was selflove rather than love of  her  that gave rise to these thoughtshe felt the want of female sympathy and tenderness to soften the fatigue of studious labour to soothe a sullen a morose dispositionhe felt he wanted comfort for himself but never once considered what Hannah's wants were  In the chagrin of a barren bed he sometimes thought too even on the child that Hannah bore him but whether it  were male or female whether a beggar in the streets or deadvarious and important public occupations forbade him to waste time to enquire Yet the poor the widow and the orphan frequently shared William's ostentatious bounty He was the president of many excellent charities gave largely and sometimes instituted benevolent societies for the unhappy for he delighted to load the poor with obligations and the rich with praise  There are persons like him who love to do every good but that which their immediate duty requiresThere are servants who will serve every one more cheerfully than their mastersThere are men who will distribute money liberally to all except their creditorsAnd there are wives who will love any man better than their husbands  Duty  is a familiar word which has little effect upon an ordinary mind and as ordinary minds are in a vast majority we have acts of generosity valour selfdenial and bounty where smaller pains would constitute greater virtuesHad William followed the  common  dictates of charity had he  adopted private pity instead of public munificence had he cast an eye at home before he sought abroad for objects of compassion Hannah had been preserved from an ignominious death and he had been preserved from  Remorse  The tortures of which he for the first time proved on reading a printed sheet of paper thrown accidentally in his way a few days after he had left the town in which he had condemned her to die  March the    th    The last dying words speech and confession birth parentage and education life character and behaviour of Hannah Primrose who was executed this morning between the hours of ten and twelve pursuant to the sentence passed upon her by the Honourable Justice Norwynne  HANNAH PRIMROSE was born of honest parents in the village of Anfield in the county ofWilliam started at the name of the village and county But being led astray by the  arts and flattery of seducing man she fell from the paths of virtue premeditated many horrid crimes and took to bad company which instilled into her young heart all their evil practices and at length brought her to this untimely end So she hopes her death will be a warning to all young persons of her own sex how they listen to the praises and courtship of young men especially of those who are their betters for they only court to deceiveBut the said Hannah freely forgives all persons who have done her injury or given her sorrow from the young man who first won her heart to the jury who found her guilty and the judge who condemned her to death  And she acknowledges the justice of her sentence not only in respect of the crime for which she suffers but in regard to many other heinous sins of which she has been guilty more especially that of once attempting to commit a murder upon her own helpless child for which guilt she now considers the vengeance of God has overtaken  her to which she is patiently resigned and parts in peace and charity with all the world praying the Lord to have mercy on her poor departing soul  POSTSCRIPT TO THE CONFESSION  So great was this unhappy woman's terror of death and the awful judgment that was to follow that when sentence was pronounced upon her she fell into a swoon from that into convulsions from which she never entirely recovered but was delirious to the time of her execution except that short interval in which she made her confession to the clergyman who attended herShe has left one child a youth about sixteen who has never forsaken his mother during all the time of her imprisonment but with true filial duty waited on herand no sooner was her fatal sentence passed than he began to droop and now lies dangerously ill near the prison from which she is released by deathDuring the loss of her senses the said Hannah  raved continually on this childand asking for pen ink and paper wrote an incoheret petition to the judge recommending the youth to his protection and mercy But notwithstanding this insanity she behaved with composure and resignation when the fatal period arrived that she was to be launched into eternity She prayed devoutly during the last hour and seemed to have her whole mind fixed on the world to which she was goingA crowd of spectators followed her to the fatal spot most of whom returned weeping at the recollection of the fervency with which she prayed and the impression which her dreadful state seemed to make upon her  No sooner had the name of "Anfield" struck William than a thousand reflections and remembrances flashed on his mind to give him conviction whom he had judged and sentenced He recollected the sad remains of Hannah such as he once had known herand now he  wondered how his thoughts could have been absent from an object so pitiable so worthy of his attention as not to give him even a suspicion who she was either from her name or from her person during the whole trial  But wonder astonishment horror and every other sensation was absorbed in  Remorse  It wounded it stabbed it rent his hard heart as it would do a tender oneIt havocked on his firm inflexible mind as it would on a weak and pliant brainSpirit of Hannah Look down and behold all your wrongs revenged William feels  Remorse  CHAPTER XLII  A FEW momentary cessations from the pangs of a guilty conscience were given to William as soon as he had dispatched a messenger to the jail in which Hannah had been confined to enquire after the son she had left behind and to give orders that immediate care should be taken of his health and safetyHe likewise charged the messenger to convey back to him the petition she had addressed to him during her supposed insanity for it was now no trivial consolation to him that he might possibly have it in his power to grant a request from her  The messenger returned with the written paper which had been considered by the persons to whom she had entrusted it as the distracted sentences of an insane mind but to William they proved beyond a doubt that she was perfectly in her senses  To Lord Chief Justice NORWYNNE  MY LORD  I AM Hannah Primrose the daughter of John and Hannah Primrose of Anfieldmy father and mother lived by the hill at the side of the little brook where you used to fish and where you first saw me  Pray my Lord have mercy on my sorrows pity me for the first time and spare my life I know I have done wrongI know it is presumption in me to dare to apply to you such a wicked and mean wretch as I am but my lord you once condescended to take notice of meand though I have been very wicked since that time yet if you would be so merciful as to spare my life I promise to amend it for the future But if you think it proper I should die I will be resigned but then I hope I beg I supplicate that you will grant my other petitionPray pray my lord if you cannot pardon me be merciful to the child I  leave behindWhat he will do when I am gone I don't knowfor I have been the only friend he has had ever since he was bornHe was born my lord about sixteen years ago at Anfield one summer's morning and carried by your cousin Mr Henry Norwynne to Mr Rymer's the curate thereand I swore whose child he was before the dean and I did not take a false oath Indeed indeed my lord I did not  I will say no more for fear this should not come safe to your hand for the people treat me as if I were madso I will say no more only this that whether I live or die I forgive every body and I hope every body will forgive meand I pray that God will take pity on my son if you refuse but I hope you will not refuse  HANNAH PRIMROSE  William rejoiced as he laid down the petition that she had asked a favour he could bestow and hoped by his protection of the son to redress in a degree the wrongs he had done the mother  He instantly sent for the messenger into his apartment and impatiently asked "If he had seen the boy and given proper directions for his care"  "I have given directions Sir for his funeral"  "How" Cried William  "He pined away ever since his mother was confined and died two days after her execution"  Robbed by this news of his only gleam of consolationin the consciousness of having done a mortal injury for which he never now by any means could atone he saw all his honours all his riches all his proud selfish triumphs dance before him They seemed like airy nothings which in rapture he would exchange for the peace of a tranquil conscience  He envied Hannah the death to which he exposed then condemned herHe envied her even the life she struggled through from his neglectand felt that his future days would be far less happy than her former existence He calculated with precision  CHAPTER XLIII  THE progressive rise of William and fall of Hannah had now occupied nearly the term of eighteen yearsadded to these another year elapsed before the younger Henry completed the errand on which his heart was fixed Shipwreck imprisonment and ills to which the poor and unfriended traveller is peculiarly exposed detained the father and son in various remote regions until the present period and for the last fifteen years denied them the means of all correspondence with their own country  The elder Henry was now past sixty years of age and the younger almost beyond the prime of life Still length of time had not diminished but rather had encreased their anxious longings for their native home  The sorrows disappointments and fatigues that throughout these tedious years were endured by the two Henrys are of that dull monotonous kind of suffering  better omitted than described mere repetitions of the exile's woe that shall give place to the transporting joy of return from banishmentYet much as the younger had reckoned with impatient wishes the hours that were passed distant from her he loved no sooner was his disastrous voyage at an end and his feet trod upon the shores of England and a thousand wounding fears made him almost doubt whether it were happiness or misery he had obtained by his arrival If Rebecca were living he knew it must be happinessfor his heart dwelt with confidence on her faithher unchanging sentiments "But death might possibly have ravished from his hopes what no mortal power could have done" And thus the lover creates a rival in every ill rather than suffer his fears to remain inanimate  The elder Henry had less to fear or to hope than his sonyet he both feared and hoped with a sensibility that gave him inexpressible anxiety He hoped his brother would receive him with kindness after his long absence and once  more take his son cordially to his favour He longed impatiently to behold his brother to see his nephew nay in the ardour of the renewed affection he just now felt he thought even a distant view of Lady Clementina would be grateful to his sight But still well remembering the pomp the state the pride of William he could not rely on  his  affection so much he knew that it depended on external circumstances to excite or to extinguish his love Not that he feared an absolute repulsion from his brother but he feared what to a delicate mind is still worseReserved manners cold looks absent sentences and all the cruel retinue of indifference with which those who are beloved so often wound the bosom that adores them  By enquiring of their countrymen whom they met as they approached to the end of their voyage concerning their relation the dean the two Henrys learned that he was well and had for some years past been exalted to the bishoprick of * * * This news gave them joy while it encreased their fear of not receiving a familiar welcome  The younger Henry on his landing wrote immediately to his uncle acquainting him with his father's arrival in the most abject state of poverty he addressed his letters to the bishop's country residence where he knew as it was the summer season he would certainly be He and his father then set off on foot towards that residencea palace  The bishop's palace was not situated above fifty miles from the port where they had landed and at a small inn about three miles from the bishop's they proposed as the letter to him intimated to wait for his answer before they intruded into his presence  At the town where they came on shore and as they walked on their journey though it was somewhat solitary that they knew no creature whom they met or saw yet it was no small consolation that no creature knew them  "To be poor and ragged father" the younger smilingly said "is no disgrace no shame thank heaven where the object is not known"  "True my son" replied Henry "and perhaps I feel myself much happier now unknowing and unknown to all but you than I shall in the presence of my fortunate brother and his family for there confusion at my ill success through life may give me greater pain than even my misfortunes have inflicted"  After uttering this reflection that had preyed upon his mind he sat down on the road side to rest his discomfited limbs before he could proceed farther His son reasoned with him gave him courage and now his hopes preponderated till after two days' journey on arriving at the inn where an answer from the bishop was expected no letter no message had been left  "He means to renounce us" Said Henry trembling and whispering to his son  Without disclosing to the people of the house who they were or from whom the letter or the message they enquired for was to have cone they retired and consulted what steps they were now to pursue  Previously to his writing to the bishop the younger Henry's heart all his inclinations had swayed him towards a visit to the village in which was his uncle's former country seatthe beloved village of Anfieldbut respect and duty to him had made him check those wishesnow they revived againand with the image of Rebecca before his eyes he warmly entreated his father to go with him to Anfield at present only thirty miles distance and from thence write once morethen wait the will of his uncle  The father consented to this proposal even glad to postpone the visit to his dignified brother  After a scanty repast such as they had been long inured to they quitted the inn and took the road towards Anfield  CHAPTER XLIV  IT was about five in the afternoon of a summer's day that Henry and his son left the sign of the Mermaid and began their third day's journey the young man's spirits elated with the prospect of the reception he should meet from Rebecca the elder dejected at not receiving a welcome from his brother  The road which led to Anfield necessarily took our travellers within sight of the bishop's palacethe turrets appeared at a distanceand on the sudden turn round the corner of a large plantation the whole magnificent structure was at once exhibited before his brother's astonished eyes He was struck with the grandeur of the habitationand totally forgetting all the unkind the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its owner like the same Henry in his earlier years smiled with a kind of transport "that William was so great a man"  After this first joyous sensation was over "Let us go a little nearer my son" said he "no one will see us I hope or if they should you can run and conceal yourself and not a creature will know  me  even my brother would not know me thus alteredand I wish to take a little farther view of his fine house and all his pleasure grounds"  Young Henry though impatient to be gone would not object to his father's desireThey walked forward between a shady grove and a purling rivulet snuffed in odours from the jessamine banks and listened to the melody of an adjoining aviary  The allurements of the spot seemed to enchain the elder Henry and he at length sauntered to the very avenue of the dwelling but just as he had set his daring yet trembling feet upon the turf that led to the palace gates he suddenly stopped on hearing as he thought the village clock strike seven which reminded him that evening drew on and it was time to goHe listened againwhen he and his  son both together said "It is the toll of the bell before some funeral"  The signals of death while they humble the rich inspire the poor with pride The passingbell gave Henry a momentary sense of equality and he courageously stept forward to the first winding of the avenue  He darted back at the sight which presented itself  A hearsemourning coachesmutesplumed horseswith every other token of the person's importance who was going to be committed to the earth  Scarce had his terrified eyes been thus unexpectedly struckwhen a coffin borne by six men issued from the gates and was deposited in the waiting receptacle while gentlemen in mourning went into the different coaches  A standardbearer now appeared with an escutcheon on which the keys and mitre were displayed Young Henry upon this pathetically exclaimed  "My uncleIt is my uncle's funeral"  Henry his father burst into tears  The procession moved along  The two Henrys the only real mourners in the train followed at a little distancein rags but in tears  The elder Henry's heart was nearly burstinghe longed to clasp the dead corpse of his brother without the dread of being spurned for his presumptionHe now could no longer remember him either as the dean or bishop but leaping over that whole interval of pride and arrogance called only to his memory William such as he knew him when they lived at home together together walked to London and there together almost perished for want  They arrived at the churchand while the coffin was placing in the dreary vault Henry crept slowly after to the hideous spotHis reflections now took a different point "Is this possible" he said to himself "Is this the dean whom I ever feared Is this the bishop of whom within the present hour I stood in awe Is this William whose every glance struck me with his superiority Alas my brother and is this horrid abode the return for all your aspiring efforts Is this the only  remains of your greatness which you exhibit to me on my return Did you foresee an end like this while you treated me and many more of your youthful companions with haughtiness and contempt While you thought it becoming of your dignity to shun and despise us Where is the difference now between my departed wife and you or if there be a difference she perchance has the advantageAh my poor brother for distinction in the other world I trust some of your anxious labours have been employed for you are now of less importance in this than when you and I first left our native town and hoped for nothing greater than to be suffered to exist"  On their quitting the church they enquired of the bystanders particulars of the bishop's death and heard he had been suddenly carried off by a raging fever  Young Henry enquired "If Lady Clementina was at the palace or Mr Norwynne"  "The latter is there"he was answered by a poor woman "but Lady  Clementina has been dead these four years"  "Dead Dead" cried young Henry "That worldly woman quitted this world for ever"  "Yes" answered the stranger "she caught cold by wearing a newfashioned dress that did not half cover her wasted all away and died the miserablest object you ever heard of"  The person who gave this melancholy intelligence concluded it with a hearty laugh which would have surprised the two hearers if they had not before observedthat amongst all the village crowd that attended to see this solemn show not one afflicted countenance appeared not one dejected look not one watery eye The pastor was scarcely known to his flockit was in London his meridian layat the levee of ministersat the table of peersat the drawingrooms of the greatand now his neglected parishioners paid his indifference in kind  The ceremony over and the mourningsuite departed the spectators dispersed with smiling faces from the sad spot  while the Henrys with heavy hearts retraced their steps back towards the palaceIn their way at the crossing of a stile they met a poor labourer returning from his day's work who looking earnestly at the throng of persons who were leaving the churchyard said to the elder Henry  "Pray master what are all them folk gathered together about What's the matter there"  "There has been a funeral" Replied Henry  "Oh zooks what a buryingay now I see it isand I warrant of our old bishopI heard he was main illIt is he they have been putting into the ground is not it"  "Yes" Said Henry  "Why then so much the better"  "The better" cried Henry  "Yes masterthough I should be loath to be where he is now"  Henry started"He was your pastor man"  "Ha ha haI should be sorry that my master's sheep that are feeding yonder  should have no better pastorthe fox would soon get them all"  "You surely did not know him"  "Not much I can't say I didfor he was above speaking to poor folksunless they did any mischief and then he was sure to take notice of them"  "I believe he meant well" Said Henry  "As to what he meant God only knowsbut I know what he  did  "  "And what did he"  "Nothing at all for the poor"  "If any of them applied to him no doubt"  "Oh they knew better than all that comes tofor if they asked for any thing he was sure to have them sent to bridewell or the workhouseHe used to say"  The workhouse was a fine place for a poor manthe food good enough and enough of it  " yet he kept a dainty table himself His dogs too fared better than we poor He was vastly tender and good to all his horses and dogs I  will  say that for him and to all brute beasts he would suffer them to be either starved or  struckbut he had no compassion for his fellow creatures"  "I am sensible you do him wrong"  "That  he  is the best judge of by this time He has sent many a poor man to the house of correctionand now 'tis well if he has not got a place there himself Ha ha ha"  "Did he give nothing in charity"  "Next to nothing A little weak broth that runs through one's stomach like mada working man master can't live on such messand my wife wore out more shoeleather going after it and lost more time waiting at the door before his fat servants would bring it her than the thing was worthHowever as we should not speak ill of the dead I say nothing against him So good night master"  The man was walking away when Henry called to him"Pray can you tell me if the bishop's son is at the palace"  "Oh yes you'll find master there treading in the the old man's shoes as proud as Lucifer"  "Has he any children"  No please God There's been enough of the nameand after the son is gone I hope we shall have no more of the breed"  "Is Mrs Norwynne the son's wife at the palace"  "What master did not you know what's become of her"  "Any accident"  "Ha ha hayes I can't help laughingwhy master she made a mistake and went to another man's bedand so her husband and she were partedand she has married the other man"  "Indeed" cried Henry amazed  "Ay indeedbut if it had been my wife or yours the bishop would have made her do penance in a white sheetbut as it was a lady why it was all very welland any one of us that had been known to talk about it would have been sent to bridewell straightBut we  did  talk notwithstanding"  The malicious joy with which the peasant told this story made Henry believe more than all the complaints the man uttered that there had been want of charity  and christian deportment in the conduct of the bishop's family He almost wished himself back on his savage island where brotherly love could not be less than it appeared to be in this civilised country  CHAPTER XLV  AS Henry and his son after parting from the poor labourer approached the late bishop's palace all the charms of its magnificence its situation which but a few hours before had captivated the elder Henry's mind was vanishedand from the mournful ceremony he had since been witness of he now viewed this noble edifice but as a heap of rubbish piled together to fascinate weak understandings and to make even the wise and religious man at times forget why he was sent into this world  Instead of presenting themselves to their nephew and cousin they both felt an unconquerable reluctance to enter under the superb the melancholy roofa bank a hedge a tree a hill seemed at this juncture a pleasanter shelter and each felt himself happy in being a harmless wanderer on the face of the earth rather than living in splendor while the  wants the revilings of the hungry and the naked were crying to heaven for vengeance  They gave a heartfelt sigh to the vanity of the rich and the powerful and pursued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue and happiness  They arrived at Anfield  Possessed by apprehensions which his uncle's funeral had served to encrease young Henry as he entered the wellknown village feared every sound he heard would convey intelligence of Rebecca's death He saw the parsonage house at a distance but dreaded to approach it lest Rebecca should no longer be an inhabitantHis father indulged him in the wish to take a short survey of the village and rather learn by indirect means by observation his fate than hear it all at once from the lips of some blunt relater  Anfield had undergone great changes since Henry left itHe found some cottages raised where formerly there were none and some were no more where he had frequently called and held short  conversations with the poor who dwelt in them Amongst the latter number was the house of Hannah's parentsfallen to the ground He wondered to himself where that poor family had taken up their abode Henry in a kinder world  He once again cast a look at the parsonage househis inquisitive eye informed him there no alteration had taken place externallybut he feared what change might be within  At length he obtained the courage to enter the churchyard in his way to itAs he slowly and tremblingly moved along he stopped to read here and there a gravestone as mild instructive conveyers of intelligence to which he could attend with more resignation than to any o her reporter  The second stone he came to he found was erected  To the memory of the Reverend Thomas Rymer  Rebecca's father He instantly called to mind all that poor enrate's quick sensibility of wrong towards  himself  his unbridled rage in consequence and smiled to thinkhow trivial  now appeared all for which he gave way to such excess of passion  But shocked at the death of one so near to her he loved he now feared to read on and accidentally cast his eyes from the tombs to the church Through the window of the chancel his sight was struck with a tall monument of large dimensions raised since his departure and adorned with the finest sculpture His curiosity was excitedhe drew near and he could distinguish followed by elegant poetic praise "  To the memory of John Lord Viscount Bendham  "  Notwithstanding the solemn melancholy anxious bent of Henry's mind he could not read these words and behold his costly fabric without indulging a momentary fit of indignant laughter  "Are sculpture and poetry thus debased" he cried "to perpetuate the memory of a man whose best advantage is to be forgotten Whose no one action merits record but as an example to be shunned"  An elderly woman leaning on her stick now passed along the lane by the  side of the churchThe younger Henry accosted her and ventured to enquire "Where the daughters of Mr Rymer since his death were gone to live"  "We live" she returned "in that small cottage across the clover field"  Henry looked again and thought he had mistaken the word  we  for he felt assured that he had no knowledge of the person to whom he spoke  But she knew him and after a pause cried"Ah Mr Henry you are welcome back I am heartily glad to see youand my poor sister Rebecca will go out of her wits with joy"  "Is Rebecca living and will be glad to see me" he cagerly asked while tears of rapture trickled down his face "Father" he continued in his ecstacy "we are now come home to be completely happyand I feel as if all the years I have been away were but a short week and as if all the dangers I have passed had been light as a featherBut is it possible" he cried to his kind informer "that you are one of Rebecca's sisters"  Well might he ask for instead of the blooming woman of sevenandtwenty he  had left her her colour was gone her teeth impaired her voice broken She was near fifty  "Yes I am one of Mr Rymer's daughters" She replied  "But which" Said Henry  "The eldest and once called the prettiest" She returned "Though now people tell me I am alteredyet I cannot say I see it myself"  "And are you all living" Henry enquired  "All but one she married and died The other three on my father's death agreed to live together and knit or spin for our support So we took that small cottage and furnished it with some of the parsonage furniture as you shall seeand kindly welcome I am sure you will be to all it affords though that is but little"  As she was saying this she led him through the clover field towards the cottageHis heart rebounded with joy that Rebecca was thereyet as he walked he shuddered at the impression which he feared the first sight of her would  make He feared what he imagined till he had seen this change in his sister he should never heed He feared Rebecca would look no longer young He was not yet sufficient master over all his sensual propensities as when the trial came to think he could behold her look like her sister and not give some evidence of his disappointment  His fears were vainOn entering the gate of their little garden Rebecca rushed from the house to meet them just the same Rebecca as ever  It was her mind which beaming on her face and actuating her every motion had ever constituted all her charms it was her mind which had gained her Henry's affection that mind had undergone no change and she was the selfsame woman he had left her  He was entranced with joy  CHAPTER XLVI  THE fare which the Henrys partook at the cottage of the female Rymers was such as the sister had described mean and even scanty but this did not in the least diminish the happiness they received in meeting for the first time since their arrival in England human beings who were glad to see them  At a stinted repast of milk and vegetables a glimmering light by a little brushwood on the hearth they yet could feel themselves comparatively blest while they listened to the recital of afflictions which had befallen persons around that very neighbourhood for whom every delicious viand had been procured to gratify the taste every art devised to delight all the other senses  It was by the side of this glimmering fire that Rebecca and her sisters told the story of poor Hannah's fate and of the thorn it had for ever planted in William's bosomof his reported sleepless  perturbed nights and his gloomy or starting and halfdistracted days when in the fullness of remorse he has complained"Of a guilty conscience Of the weariness attached to continued prosperity the misery of wanting an object of affection"  They told of Lord Bendham's death from the effects of intemperance from a mass of blood infected by high seasoned dishes mixed with copious draughts of winerepletion of food and liquor not less fatal to the existence of the rich than the want of common sustenance to the lives of the poor  They told of Lady Bendham's ruin since her Lord's death by gamingThey told "that now she suffered beyond the pain of common indigence by the cutting triumph of those whom she had formerly despised"  They related what has been told before the divorce of William and the marriage of his wife with a libertineThe decease of Lady Clementina occasioned by that incorrigible vanity which even old age could not subdue  After numerous other examples had been recited of the dangers the evils that riches draw upon their owner the elder Henry rose from his chair and embracing Rebecca and his son said  "How much indebted are  we  to providence my children who while it inflicts poverty bestows peace of mind and in return for the trivial grief we meet in this world holds out to our longing hopes the reward of the next"  Not only resigned but happy in their station with hearts made cheerful rather than dejected by attentive meditation Henry and his son planned the means of their future support independent of their kinsman Williamnot only of him but of every person and thing but their own industry  "While I have health and strength" cried the old man and his son's looks acquiesced in all the father said "I will not take from any one in affluence what only belongs to the widow the fatherless and the infirm for to such alone by christian lawshowever custom may subvert themthe overplus of the rich is due"  CHAPTER XLVII  BY forming an humble scheme for their remaining life a scheme depending upon their  own  exertions alone on no light promises of pretended friends and on no sanguine hopes of certain success but with prudent apprehension with fortitude against disappointment Henry his son and Rebecca now his daughter found themselves at the end of one year in the enjoyment of every comfort which such distinguished minds knew how to taste  Exempt both from patronage and from controulhealthy alive to every fruition with which nature blesses the world dead to all out of their power to attain the works of artsusceptible of those passions which endear human creatures one to another insensible to those which separate man from manthey found themselves the thankful inhabitants of a small house or hut placed on the borders of the sea  Each morning wakes the father and the son to cheerful labour in fishing or the tending of a garden the produce of which they carry with their fish to the next market town The evening sends them back to their home in joy where Rebecca meets them at the door affectionately boasts of the warm meal that is ready and heightens the charms of conversation with her taste and judgment  It was after a supper of roots from their little garden poultry that Rebecca's hand had reared and a jug brewed by young Henry that the following discourse took place  "My son" said the elder Henry "where under the sky shall three persons be met together happy as we three are It is the want of industry or the want of reflection which makes the poor dissatisfied Labour gives a value to rest which the idle can never taste and reflection gives to the mind content which the unthinking never can know"  "I once" replied the younger Henry "considered poverty a cursebut after  my thoughts became enlarged and I had associated for years with the rich and now mix with the poor my opinion has undergone a total changefor I have seen and have enjoyed more real pleasure at work with my fellow labourers and in this cottage than ever I beheld or experienced during my abode at my uncle's during all my intercourse with the fashionable and the powerful of this world"  "The worst is" said Rebecca "the poor have not always enough"  "Who has enough" asked her husband "Had my uncle Nohe hoped for moreand in all his writings sacrificed his duty to his avarice Had his son enough when he yielded up his honour his domestic peace to gratify his ambition Had Lady Bendham enough when she staked all she had in the hope of becoming richer Were we my Rebecca of discontented minds we have now too little But conscious from observation and experience that the rich are not so happy as ourselves we rejoice in our lot"  The tear of joy that stole from her eye expressed more than his wordsa state of happiness  He continued "I remember that when I first came a boy to England the poor excited my compassion but now that my judgment is matured I pity the rich I know that in this opulent kingdom there are near as many persons perishing through intemperance as starving with hungerthere are as many miserable in the lassitude of having nothing to do as there are bowed down to the earth with hard labourthere are more persons who draw upon themselves calamity by following their own will than there are who experience it by obeying the will of another Add to this the rich fear dying so much they have no comfort in living"  "There the poor have another advantage" said Rebecca "for they may defy not only death but every loss by sea or land for they have nothing to lose"  "Besides" added the elder Henry "there is a certain joy of the most gratifying kind that the human mind is capable  of tasting peculiar to the poor and of which the rich can but seldom experience the delight"  "What can that be" cried Rebecca  "A kind word a benevolent smile one token of esteem from the person whom we consider as our superior"  To which Rebecca replied "And the rarity of obtaining such a token is what encreases the honour"  "Certainly" returned young Henry "and yet those in poverty ungrateful as they are murmur against that government from which they receive the blessing and unlearned as they are would attempt to alter itWe leave to the physician the care of restoring our health we employ the soldier in fighting our battles and the lawyer in the defence of our fortunes without presuming to interrupt them in their vocationsthen why not leave and without molestation those to govern a kingdom who have studied the science of politics For though a physician may not always be skilful a soldier may not always have courage a lawyer not always honesty or a minister  always good fortuneyet we should consider that it is not upon earth we are to look for a state of perfectionit is only in heavenand there we may rest assured that no practitioner in the professions I have named will ever be admitted to disturb our eternal felicity  THE END
