Africa by the Vandals  DURING a long and disgraceful reign of of twentyeight years Honorius emperor of the West was separated from the friendship  Last years and death of Honorius A D Aug  of his brother and afterwards of his nephew who reigned over the East and Constantinople beheld with apparent indifference and secret joy the calamities of Rome The strange adventures of Placidia  See Chap xxxi  gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two empires The daughter  of the great Theodosius had been the captive and the queen of the Goths she lost an affectionate husband she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin she tasted the pleasure of revenge and was exchanged in the treaty of peace for six hundred thousand measures of wheat After her return from Spain to Italy Placidia experienced a new persecution in the bosom of her family She was averse to a marriage which had been stipulated without her consent and the brave Constantius as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquished received from the hand of Honorius himself the struggling and reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus But her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials nor did Placidia refuse to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian the third or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband The generous soldier whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition he extorted the title of Augustus and the servant of Honorius was associated to the empire of the West The death of Constantius in the seventh month of his reign instead of diminishing seemed to increase the power of Placidia and the indecent familiarity  is the expression of Olympiodorus apud Photium p who means perhaps to describe the same caresses which Mahomet bestowed on his  daughter  Phatemah Quando says the prophet himself quando subit mihi desiderium Paradisi osculor cam et ingero linguam meam in os ejus But this sensual indulgence was justified by miracle and mystery and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Father Maracci in his Version and Confutation of the Koran tom i p  of her  brother which might be no more than the symptoms of a childish affection were universally attributed to incestuous love On a sudden by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse this excessive fondness was converted into an irreconcileable quarrel the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace and as the Gothic soldiers adhered to their queen the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary retreat of Placidia and her children The royal exiles landed at Constantinople soon after the marriage of Theodosius during the festival of the Persian victories They were treated with kindness and magnificence but as the statues of the emperor Constantius had been rejected by the Eastern court the title of Augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow Within a few months after the arrival of Placidia a swift messenger announced the death of Honorius the consequence of a dropsy but the important secret was not divulged till the necessary orders had been dispatched for the march of a large body of troops to the seacoast of Dalmatia The shops and the gates of Constantinople remained shut during seven days and the loss of a foreign prince who could neither be esteemed nor regretted  was celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public grief  While the ministers of Constantinople deliberated  Elevation and fall of the usurper John A D  the vacant throne of Honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger The name of the rebel was John he filled the confidential office of  Primicerius  or principal secretary and history has attributed to his character more virtues than can easily be reconciled with the violation of the most sacred duty Elated by the submission of Italy and the hope of an alliance with the Huns John presumed to insult by an embassy the majesty of the Eastern emperor but when he understood that his agents had been banished imprisoned and at length chaced away with deserved ignominy John prepared to assert by arms the injustice of his claims In such a cause the grandson of the great Theodosius should have marched in person but the young emperor was easily diverted by his physicians from so rash and hazardous a design and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently entrusted to Ardaburius and his son Aspar who had already signalised their valour against the Persians It was resolved that Ardaburius should embark with the infantry whilst Aspar at the head of the cavalry conducted Placidia and her son Valentinian along the seacoast of the Hadriatic The march of the cavalry was performed with such active diligence that they surprised without resistance the important city of Aquileia when the hopes of Aspar were unexpectedly confounded  by the intelligence that a storm had dispersed the Imperial fleet and that his father with only two gallies was taken and carried a prisoner into the port of Ravenna Yet this incident unfortunate as it might seem facilitated the conquest of Italy Ardaburius employed or abused the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution he invited by private messages and pressed the approach of Aspar A shepherd whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel guided the Eastern cavalry by a secret and it was thought an impassable road through the morasses of the Po the gates of Ravenna after a short struggle were thrown open and the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy or rather to the cruelty of the conquerors His right hand was first cut off and after he had been exposed mounted on an ass to the public derision John was beheaded in the Circus of Aquileia The emperor Theodosius when he received the news of the victory interrupted the horseraces and singing as he marched through the streets a suitable psalm conducted his people from the Hippodrome to the church where he spent the remainder of the day in grateful devotion  For these revolutions of the Western empire consult Olympiodor apud Phot p Sozomen l ix c Socrates l vii Philostorgius l xii c and Godefroy Dissertat p Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p Theophanes in Chronograph p and the Chronicles    In a monarchy which according to various precedents might be considered as elective or hereditary or patrimonial it was impossible that  Valentinian III emperor of the West A D  the intricate claims of female and collateral succession should be clearly defined  See Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis l ii c He has laboriously but vainly attempted to form a reasonable system of jurisprudence from the various and discordant modes of royal succession which have been introduced by fraud or force by time or accident  and Theodosius by the right of consanguinity or conquest might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the Romans For a moment perhaps his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway but his indolent temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy He contented himself with the possession of the East and wisely relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful war against the Barbarians beyond the Alps or of securing the obedience of the Italians and Africans whose minds were alienated by the irreconcileable difference of language and interest Instead of listening to the voice of ambition Theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather and to seat his cousin Valentinian on the throne of the West The royal infant was distinguished at Constantinople by the title of  Nobilissimus  he was promoted before his departure from Thessalonica to the rank and dignity of  Caesar  and after the conquest of Italy the patrician Helion by the authority of Theodosius and in the presence of the senate saluted Valentinian  the third by the name of Augustus and solemnly invested him with the diadem and the Imperial purple  The original writers are not agreed see Muratori Annali d'Italia tom iv p whether Valentinian received the Imperial diadem at Rome or Ravenna In this uncertainty I am willing to believe that some respect was shewn to the senate  By the agreement of the three females who governed the Roman world the son of Placidia was betrothed to Eudoxia the daughter of Theodosius and Athenais and as soon as the lover and his bride had attained the age of puberty this honourable alliance was faithfully accomplished At the same time as a compensation perhaps for the expences of the war the Western Illyricum was detached from the Italian dominions and yielded to the throne of Constantinople  The count de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii p has established the reality explained the motives and traced the consequences of this remarkable cession  The emperor of the East acquired the useful dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia and the dangerous sovereignty of Pannonia and Noricum which had been filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of Huns Ostrogoths Vandals and  Bavarians  Theodosius and Valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public and domestic alliance but the unity of the Roman government was finally dissolved By a positive declaration the validity of all future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar author unless he should think proper to communicate them subscribed with his own  hand for the approbation of his independent colleague  See the first  Novel  of Theodosius by which he ratifies and communicates A D the Theodosian Code About forty years before that time the unity of legislation had been proved by an exception The Jews who were numerous in the cities of Apulia and Calabria produced a law of the East to justify their exemption from municipal offices Cod Theod l xvi tit viii leg and the Western emperor was obliged to invalidate by a special edict the law quam constat meis partibus esse damnosam Cod Theod l xi tit i leg    Valentinian when he received the title of Augustus  Administration of his mother Placidia A D  was no more than six years of age and his long minority was entrusted to the guardian care of a mother who might assert a female claim to the succession of the Western empire Placidia envied but she could not equal the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of Theodosius the elegant genius of Eudocia the wise and successful policy of Pulcheria The mother of Valentinian was jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising  Cassiodorius Varior l xi epist i p has compared the regencies of Placidia and Amalasuntha He arraigns the weakness of the mother of Valentinian and praises the virtues of his royal mistress On this occasion flattery seems to have spoken the language of truth  she reigned twentyfive years in the name of her son and the character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the suspicion that Placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute education and studiously diverted his attention from every manly and honourable pursuit Amidst the decay  Her two generals Aetius and Boniface  of military spirit her armies were commanded  by two generals Aetius  Philostorgius l xii c and Godefroy's Dissertat p c and Renatus Frigeridus apud Gregor Turon l ii c in tom ii p The father of Aetius was Gaudentius an illustrious citizen of the province of Scythia and mastergeneral of the cavalry his mother was a rich and noble Italian From his earliest youth Aetius as a soldier and a hostage had conversed with the Barbarians  and Boniface  For the character of Boniface see Olympiodorus apud Phot p and St Augustin apud Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xiii p The bishop of Hippo at length deplored the fall of his friend who after a solemn vow of chastity had married a second wife of the Arian sect and who was suspected of keeping several concubines in his house  who may be deservedly named as the last of the Romans Their union might have supported a sinking empire their discord was the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa The invasion and defeat of Attila has immortalized the fame of Aetius and though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival the defence of Marscelles and the deliverance of Africa attest the military talents of count Boniface In the field of battle in partial encounters in single combats he was still the terror of the Barbarians the clergy and particularly his friend Augustin were edified by the Christian piety which had once tempted him to retire from the world the people applauded his spotless integrity the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice which may be displayed in a very singular example A peasant who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a Gothic soldier was directed to attend his tribunal the following day in the evening the count who had diligently  informed himself of the time and place of the assignation mounted his horse rode ten miles into the country surprised the guilty couple punished the soldier with instant death and silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him the next morning with the head of the adulterer The abilities of Aetius and Boniface might have been usefully employed against the public enemies in separate and important commands but the experience of their past conduct should have decided the real favour and confidence of the empress Placidia In the melancholy season of her exile and distress Boniface alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity and the troops and treasures of Africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion The same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of Aetius who brought an army of sixty thousand Huns from the Danube to the confines of Italy for the service of the usurper The untimely death of John compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty but he still continued the subject and the soldier of Valentinian to entertain a secret perhaps a treasonable correspondence with his Barbarian allies whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts and more liberal promises But Aetius possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign he was present he besieged with artful and assiduous flattery the palace of Ravenna disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship and at length  deceived both his mistress and his absent rival by a subtle conspiracy which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily suspect He  Error and revolt of Boniface in Africa A D  secretly persuaded  Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p relates the fraud of Aetius the revolt of Boniface and the loss of Africa This anecdote which is supported by some collateral testimony see Ruinart Hist Persecut Vandal p seems agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts and would be naturally revealed by the repentance of Boniface  Placidia to recal Boniface from the government of Africa he secretly advised Boniface to disobey the Imperial summons to the one he represented the order as a sentence of death to the other he stated the refusal as a signal of revolt and when the credulous and unsuspectful count had armed the province in his defence Aetius applauded his sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion which his own perfidy had excited A temperate enquiry into the real motives of Boniface would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the republic but the arts of Aetius still continued to betray and to inflame and the count was urged by persecution to embrace the most desperate counsels The success with which he eluded or repelled the first attacks could not inspire a vain confidence that at the head of some loose disorderly Africans he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the West commanded by a rival whose military character it was impossible for him to despise After some hesitation the last struggles of prudence and loyalty Boniface dispatched a trusty friend to the court or rather to the camp of Gonderic king of the Vandals with the proposal  of a strict alliance and the offer of an advantageous and perpetual settlement  After the retreat of the Goths the authority of  He invites the Vandals A D  Honorius had obtained a precarious establishment in Spain except only in the province of Gallicia where the Suevi and the Vandals had fortified their camps in mutual discord and hostile independence The Vandals prevailed and their adversaries were besieged in the Nervasian hills between Leon and Oviedo till the approach of Count Asterius compelled or rather provoked the victorious Barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of Boetica The rapid progress of the Vandals soon required a more effectual opposition and the mastergeneral Castinus marched against them with a numerous army of Romans and Goths Vanquished in battle by an inferior enemy Castinus fled with dishonour to Tarragona and this memorable defeat which has been represented as the punishment was most probably the effect of his rash presumption  See the Chronicles of Prosper and Idatius Salvian de Gubernat Dei l vii p Paris ascribes the victory of the Vandals to their superior piety They fasted they prayed they carried a Bible in the front of the Host with the design perhaps of reproaching the perfidy and sacrilege of their enemies  Seville and Carthagena became the reward or rather the prey of the ferocious conquerors and the vessels which they found in the harbour of Carthagena might easily transport them to the isles of Majorca and Minorca where the Spanish fugitives as in a secure recess had vainly concealed their families and their fortunes The  experience of navigation and perhaps the prospect of Africa encouraged the Vandals to accept the invitation which they received from Count Boniface and the death of Gonderic served only to forward and animate the bold enterprise In the room of a prince not conspicuous for any superior powers of the mind or body they acquired his bastard brother the terrible Genseric  Gizericus his name is variously expressed staturâ mediocris et equi casû claudicans animo profundus sermone rarus luxuriae contemptor irâ turbidus habendi cupidus ad solicitandas gentes providentissimus semina contentionum jacere odia miscere paratus Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c p This portrait which is drawn with some skill and a strong likeness must have been copied from the Gothic history of Cassiodorius  a name  Genseric king of the Vandals  which in the destruction of the Roman empire has deserved an equal rank with the names of Alaric and Attila The king of the Vandals is described to have been of a middle stature with a lameness in one leg which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horse His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep purposes of his soul he disdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquished but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and revenge The ambition of Genseric was without bounds and without scruples and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark engines of policy of solicit the allies who might be useful to his success or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred and contention Almost in the moment of his departure he was informed that Hermanric king of the Suevi had presumed to ravage the Spanish  territories which he was resolved to abandon Impatient of the insult Genseric pursued the hasty retreat of the Suevi as far as Merida precipitated the king and his army into the river Anas and calmly returned to the seashore to embark his victorious troops The vessels which transported the Vandals over the modern Streights  He lands in Africa A D May  of Gibraltar a channel only twelve miles in breadth were furnished by the Spaniards who anxiously wished their departure and by the African general who had implored their formidable assistance  See the Chronicle of Idatius That bishop a Spaniard and a contemporary places the passage of the Vandals in the month of May of the year of Abraham which commences in October This date which coincides with A D is confirmed by Isidore another Spanish bishop and is justly preferred to the opinion of those writers who have marked for that event one of the two preceding years See Pagi Critica tom ii p c  Our fancy so long accustomed to exaggerate  and reviews his army A D  and multiply the martial swarms of Barbarians that seemed to issue from the North will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which Genseric mustered on the coast of Mauritania The Vandals who in twenty years had penetrated from the Elbe to Mount Atlas were united under the command of their warlike king and he reigned with equal authority over the Alani who had passed within the term of human life from the cold of Scythia to the excessive heat of an African climate The hopes of the bold enterprise had excited many brave adventurers of the Gothic nation and many desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes  by the same means which had occasioned their ruin Yet this various multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men and though Genseric artfully magnified his apparent strength by appointing eighty  chiliarchs  or commanders of thousands the fallacious increase of old men of children and of slaves would scarcely have swelled his army to the number of fourscore thousand persons  Compare Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p and Victor Vitensis de Persecutione Vandal l i c p edit Ruinart We are assured by Idatius that Genseric evacuated Spain cum Vandalis  omnibus  eorumque familiis and Possidius in Vit Augustin c apud Ruinart p describes his army as manus ingens immanium gentium Vandalorum et Alanorum commixtam secum habens Gothorum gentem aliarumque diversarum personas  But his own dexterity and the discontents of Africa soon fortified the Vandal powers by the accession of numerous and active allies The parts of Mauritania which  The Moors  border on the great desert and the Atlantic ocean were filled with a fierce and untractable race of men whose savage temper had been exasperated rather than reclaimed by their dread of the Roman arms The wandering Moors  For the manners of the Moors see Procopius de Bell Vandal l ii c p for their figure and complexion M de Busson Histoire Naturelle tom iii p Procopius says in general that the Moors had joined the Vandals before the death of Valentinian de Bell Vandal l i c p and it is probable that the independent tribes did not embrace any uniform system of policy  as they gradually ventured to approach the seashore and the camp of the Vandals must have viewed with terror and astonishment the dress the armour the martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had landed on their  coast and the fair complexions of the blueeyed warriors of Germany formed a very singular contrast with the swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighbourhood of the torrid zone After the first difficulties had in some measure been removed which arose from the mutual ignorance of their respective language the Moors regardless of any future consequence embraced the alliance of the enemies of Rome and a crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and vallies of Mount Atlas to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants who had injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the land  The persecution of the Donatists  See Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xiii p and the whole series of the persecution in the original monuments published by Dupin at the end of Optatus p  was an  The Donatists  event not less favourable to the designs of Genseric Seventeen years before he landed in Africa a public conference was held at Carthage by the order of the magistrate The Catholics were satisfied that after the invincible reasons which they had alleged the obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary and the emperor Honorius was persuaded to inflict the most rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his patience and clemency Three hundred bishops  The Donatist bishops at the conference of Carthage amounted to and they asserted that their whole number was not less than The Catholics had present absent besides sixtyfour vacant bishopries  with many thousands of the inferior clergy were torn from their churches  stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions banished to the islands and proscribed by the laws if they presumed to conceal themselves in the provinces of Africa Their numerous congregations both in cities and in the country were deprived of the rights of citizens and of the exercise of religious worship A regular scale of fines from ten to two hundred pounds of silver was curiously ascertained according to the distinctions of rank and fortune to punish the crime of assisting at a schismatic conventicle and if the fine had been levied five times without subduing the obstinacy of the offender his future punishment was referred to the discretion of the Imperial court  The fifth title of the sixteenth book of the Theodosian Code exhibits a series of the Imperial laws against the Donatists from the year to the year Of these the th law promulgated by Honorius A D is the most severe and effectual  By these severities which obtained the warmest approbation of St Augustin  St Augustin altered his opinion with regard to the proper treatment of heretics His pathetic declaration of pity and indulgence for the Manichaeans has been inserted by Mr Locke vol iii p among the choice specimens of his commonplace book Another philosopher the celebrated Bayle tom ii p has refused with superfluous diligence and ingenuity the arguments by which the bishop of Hippo justified in his old age the persecution of the Donatists  great numbers of Donatists were reconciled to the Catholic church but the fanatics who still persevered in their opposition were provoked to madness and despair the distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed the armed troops of Circumcellions alternately pointed their rage against themselves or against their adversaries and the calendar  of martyrs received on both sides a considerable augmentation  See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiii p The Donatists boasted of  thousands  of these voluntary martyrs Augustin asserts and probably with truth that these numbers were much exaggerated but he sternly maintains that it was better that  some  should burn themselves in this world than that  all  should burn in hell flames  Under these circumstances Genseric a Christian but an enemy of the orthodox communion shewed himself to the Donatists as a powerful deliverer from whom they might reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts of the Roman emperors  According to St Augustin and Theodoret the Donatists were inclined to the principles or at least to the party of the Arians which Genseric supported Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p  The conquest of Africa was facilitated by the active zeal or the secret favour of a domestic faction the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy of which the Vandals are accused may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism of their allies and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the triumph of Christianity contributed to the loss of the most important province of the West  See Baronius Annal Eccles A D No A D No The cardinal though more inclined to seek the cause of great events in heaven than on the earth has observed the apparent connection of the Vandals and the Donatists Under the reign of the Barbarians the schismatics of Africa enjoyed an obscure peace of one hundred years at the end of which we may again trace them by the light of the Imperial persecutions See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p c    The court and the people were astonished by  Tardy repentance of Boniface A D  the strange intelligence that a virtuous hero after so many favours and so many services had renounced his allegiance and invited the Barbarians  to destroy the province entrusted to his command The friends of Boniface who still believed that his criminal behaviour might be excused by some honourable motive solicited during the absence of Aetius a free conference with the Count of Africa and Darius an officer of high distinction was named for the important embassy  In a confidential letter to Count Boniface St Augustin without examining the grounds of the quarrel piously exhorts him to discharge the duties of a Christian and a subject to extricate himself without delay from his dangerous and guilty situation and even if he could obtain the consent of his wife to embrace a life of celibacy and pennance Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiii p The bishop was intimately connected with Darius the minister of peace Id tom xiii p  In their first interview at Carthage the imaginary provocations were mutually explained the opposite letters of Aetius were produced and compared and the fraud was easily detected Placidia and Boniface lamented their fatal error and the Count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the forgiveness of his sovereign or to expose his head to her future resentment His repentance was fervent and sincere but he soon discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the edifice which he had shaken to its foundations Carthage and the Roman garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of Valentinian but the rest of Africa was still distracted with war and faction and the inexorable king of the Vandals disdaining all terms of accommodation sternly refused to relinquish the possession of his prey The band of veterans who marched under the standard  of Boniface and his hasty levies of provincial troops were defeated with considerable loss the victorious Barbarians insulted the open country and Carthage Cirta and Hippo Regius were the only cities that appeared to rise above the general inundation  The long and narrow tract of the African coast  Desolation of Africa  was filled with frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence and the respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by the distance from Carthage and the Mediterranean A simple reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation the country was extremely populous the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for their own use and the annual exportation particularly of wheat was so regular and plentiful that Africa deserved the name of the common granary of Rome and of mankind On a sudden the seven fruitful provinces from Tangier to Tripoli were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Vandals whose destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular animosity religious zeal and extravagant declamation War in its fairest form implies a perpetual violation of humanity and justice and the hostilities of Barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society The Vandals where they found resistance seldom gave quarter and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had fallen Careless of the distinctions  of age or sex or rank they employed every species of indignity and torture to force from the captives a discovery of their hidden wealth The stern policy of Genseric justified his frequent examples of military execution he was not always the master of his own passions or of those of his followers and the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of the Moors and the fanaticism of the Donatists Yet I shall not easily be persuaded that it was the common practice of the Vandals to extirpate the olives and other fruittrees of a country where they intended to settle nor can I believe that it was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their prisoners before the walls of a besieged city for the sole purpose of infecting the air and producing a pestilence of which they themselves must have been the first victims  The original complaints of the desolation of

was unable to check After the loss of a battle he retired into Hippo Regius where he was immediately besieged by an enemy who considered him as the real bulwark of Africa  The maritime colony of  Hippo  See Cellarius Geograph Antiq tom ii part ii p Leo African in Ramusio tom i fol L'Afrique de Marmol tom ii p Shaw's Travels p The old Hippo Regius was finally destroyed by the Arabs in the seventh century but a new town at the distance of two miles was built with the materials and it contained in the sixteenth century about three hundred families of industrious but turbulent manufacturers The adjacent territory is renowned for a pure air a fertile soil and plenty of exquisite fruits  about two hundred miles westward of Carthage had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of  Regius  from the residence of Numidian kings and some remains of trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city which is known in Europe by the corrupted name of Bona The military labours and anxious reflexions of Count Boniface were alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend St Augustin  The life of St Augustin by Tillemont fills a quarto volume Mem Eccles tom xiii

country The youth of Augustin had been stained by the vices and errors which he so ingenuously confesses but from the moment of his conversion to that of his death the manners of the bishop of Hippo were pure and austere and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination the Manichaeans the Donatists and the Pelagians against whom he waged a perpetual controversy  When the city some months after his death was burnt by the Vandals the library was fortunately saved which contained his voluminous writings two hundred and thirtytwo separate books or treatises on theological subjects besides a complete exposition of the psalter and the gospel and a copious magazine of epistles and homilies  Such at least is the account of Victor Vitensis

the bishop of Hippo does not extend beyond the  Confessions  and the  City of God  According to the judgment of the most impartial critics the superficial learning of Augustin was confined to the Latin language  In his early youth Confess i St Augustin disliked and neglected the study of Greek and he frankly owns that he read the Platonists in a Latin version Confess vii Some modern critics have thought that his ignorance of Greek disqualified him from expounding the scriptures and Cicero or Quintilian would have required the knowledge of that language in a professor of rhetoric  and his style though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion is usually clouded by false and affected rhetoric But he possessed a strong capacious argumentative mind he boldly sounded the dark abyss of grace predestination freewill and original sin and the rigid system of Christianity which he framed or restored  These questions were seldom agitated from the time of St Paul to that of St Augustin I am informed that the Greek fathers maintain the natural sentiments of the Semipelagians and that the orthodoxy of St Augustin was derived from the Manichaean school  has been entertained  with public applause and secret reluctance by the Latin church  The church of Rome has canonised Augustin and reprobated Calvin Yet as the  real  difference between them is invisible even to a theological

protracted above fourteen months the sea was continually open and when the adjacent country had been exhausted by irregular rapine the besiegers themselves were compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise The importance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of the West Placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally and the Italian fleet and army were reinforced by Aspar who failed from Constantinople with a powerful armament As soon as the force of the two empires was united under the command of Boniface he boldly marched against the Vandals and the loss of a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa He embarked with the precipitation of despair and the people of Hippo were permitted with their families and effects to occupy the vacant place of the soldiers the greatest part of whom were either slain or made prisoners by the Vandals The Count whose fatal  credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic might enter the palace of Ravenna with some anxiety which was soon removed by the smiles of Placidia Boniface accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician and the dignity of mastergeneral of the Roman armies but he must have blushed at

head of a subject on the reverse of an Imperial medal See Science des Medailles by the Pere Jobert tom i p edit of by the Baron de la Bastie  The discovery of his fraud the displeasure of the empress and the distinguished favour of his rival exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Aetius He hastily returned from Gaul to Italy with a retinue or rather with an army of Barbarian followers and such was the weakness of the government that the two generals decided their private quarrel in a bloody battle Boniface was successful but he  His death A D  received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his adversary of which he expired within a few days in such Christian and charitable sentiments that he exhorted his wife a rich heiress of Spain to accept Aetius for her second husband But Aetius could not derive any immediate advantage from the generosity of his dying enemy he was proclaimed a rebel by the justice of Placidia and though he attempted to defend  some strong fortresses erected on his patrimonial estate the Imperial power soon compelled him to retire into Pannonia to the tents of his faithful Huns The republic was deprived by their mutual discord of the service of her two most illustrious champions  Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p continues the history of Boniface no farther than his return to Italy His death is mentioned by Prosper and Marcellinus

accused the baseness of his birth and asserted the legitimate claims of his nephews the sons of Gonderic Those nephews indeed he  sacrificed to his safety and their mother the widow of the deceased king was precipitated by his order into the river Ampsaga But the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and frequent conspiracies and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have shed more Vandal blood

 The convulsions of Africa which had favoured his attack opposed the firm establishment of his power and the various seditions of the Moors and Germans the Donatists and Catholics continually disturbed or threatened the unsettled reign of the conqueror As he advanced towards Carthage he was forced to withdraw his troops from the Western provinces the seacoast was exposed to the naval enterprises of the Romans of Spain and Italy and in the heart of Numidia the strong inland city of Corta still persisted in obstinate independence  Possidius in Vit Augustin c apud Ruinart p  These difficulties were gradually subdued by the spirit the perseverance and the cruelty of Genseric who alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the establishment of his African kingdom He subscribed a solemn treaty with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of its continuance and the moment of its violation The vigilance of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship which concealed his hostile approach and Carthage was at  length surprised by the Vandals five hundred and eightyfive years after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger

Dei l vii p I am surprised that the  Notitia  should not place either a mint or an arsenal at Carthage but only a gynecaeum or female manufacture  displayed in a dependent condition the image of a flourishing republic Carthage contained the manufactures the arms and the treasures of the six provinces A regular subordination of civil honours gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and quarters of the city to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate who with the title of proconsul represented the state and dignity of a consul of ancient Rome Schools and  gymnasia  were instituted for the education of the African youth and the liberal arts and manners grammar rhetoric and philosophy were publicly taught in the Greek and Latin languages  The buildings of Carthage were uniform and magnificent a shady grove was planted in the midst of the capital the  new  port a secure and capacious harbour was subservient to the commercial industry of citizens and strangers and the splendid games of the circus and theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the Barbarians The reputation of the Carthaginians was not equal to that of their country and the reproach of Punic faith still adhered to their subtle and faithless character  The anonymous author of the Expositio totius Mundi compares in his barbarous Latin the country and the inhabitants and after stigmatising their want of faith he coolly concludes Difficile autem inter eos invenitur bonus tamen in multis pauci boni esse possunt P  The habits of trade and the abuse of luxury had corrupted their manners but their impious contempt of monks and the shameless practice of unnatural lusts are the two abominations which excite the pious vehemence of Salvian the preacher of the age  He declares that the peculiar vices of each country were collected in the sink of Carthage l vii p In the indulgence of vice the Africans applauded their manly virtue Et illi se magis virilis fortitudinis esse crederent qui maxime viros foeminei usûs probrositate fregissent p The streets of Carthage were polluted by effeminate wretches who publicly assumed the countenance the dress and the character of women p If a monk appeared in the city the holy man was pursued with impious scorn and ridicule detestantibus ridentium cachinnis p  The king of the Vandals severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people and the ancient noble ingenuous freedom of Carthage these expressions of Victor are not without energy was reduced by Genseric into a state of  ignominious servitude After he had permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and avarice he instituted a more regular system of rapine and oppression An edict was promulgated which enjoined all persons without fraud or delay to deliver their gold silver jewels and valuable furniture or apparel to the royal officers and the attempt to secrete any part of their patrimony was inexorably punished with death and torture as an act of treason against the state The lands of the proconsular province which formed the immediate district of Carthage were accurately measured and divided among the Barbarians and the conqueror reserved for his peculiar domain the fertile territory of Byzacium and the adjacent parts of Numidia and Getulia  Compare Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p and Victor Vitensis de Persecut Vandal l i c    It was natural enough that Genseric should hate  African exiles and captives  those whom he had injured the nobility and senators of Carthage were exposed to his jealousy and resentment and all those who refused the ignominious terms which their honour and religion forbade them to accept were compelled by the Arian tyrant to embrace the condition of perpetual banishment Rome Italy and the provinces of the East

Caelestian and  Maria  Ruinart p has collected from Theodoret and other authors the misfortunes real and fabulous of the inhabitants of Carthage  The Syrian bishop deplores the misfortunes of Caelestian who from the state of a noble and opulent senator of Carthage was reduced with his wife and family and servants to beg his bread in a foreign country but he applauds the resignation of the Christian exile and the philosophic temper which under the pressure of such calamities could enjoy more real happiness than was the ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity The story of Maria the daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon is singular and interesting In the sack of Carthage she was purchased from the Vandals by some merchants of Syria who afterwards sold her as a slave in their native country A female attendant transported in the same ship and sold in the same family still continued to respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level of servitude and the daughter of Eudaemon received from her grateful affection the domestic services which she had once required from her obedience This remarkable behaviour divulged the real condition of Maria who in the absence of the bishop of Cyrrhus was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some soldiers of the garrison The liberality of Theodoret provided for her decent maintenance and she passed ten months among the deaconesses of the church till she was unexpectedly informed that her father who had escaped from the ruin of  Carthage exercised an honourable office in one of the Western provinces Her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop Theodoret in a letter still extant recommends Maria to the bishop of Aegae a maritime city of Cilicia which was frequented during the annual fair by the vessels of the West most earnestly requesting that his colleague would use the maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth and that he would entrust her to the care of such faithful merchants as would esteem it a sufficient gain if they restored a daughter lost beyond all human hope to the arms of her afflicted parent  Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical  Fable of the seven sleepers  history I am tempted to distinguish the memorable fable of the SEVEN SLEEPERS  The choice of fabulous circumstances is of small importance yet I have confined myself to the narrative which was translated from the Syriac by the care of Gregory of Tours de Gloriâ Martyrûm l i c in Max Bibliothecâ Patrum tom xi p to the Greek acts of their martyrdom apud Photium p and to the Annals of the Patriarch Eutychius tom i p Vers Pocock  whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger Theodosius and the conquest of Africa by the Vandals  Two Syriac writers as they are quoted by Assemanni Bibliot Oriental tom i p place the resurrection of the Seven Sleepers in the years A D or A D of the aera of the Seleucides Their Greek acts which Photius had read assign the date of the thirtyeighth year of the reign of Theodosius which may coincide either with A D or The period which had elapsed since the persecution of Decius is easily ascertained and nothing less than the ignorance of Mahomet or the legendaries could suppose an interval of three or four hundred years  When the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians seven noble youths of  Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side of an adjacent mountain where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of huge stones They immediately fell into a deep slumber which was miraculously prolonged without injuring the powers of life during a period of one hundred and eightyseven years At the end of that time the slaves of Adolius to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice the light of the sun darted into the cavern and the seven sleepers were permitted to awake After a slumber as they thought of a few hours they were pressed by the calls of hunger and resolved that Jamblichus one of their number should secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his companions The youth if we may still employ that appellation could no longer recognise the once familiar aspect of his native country and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Ephesus His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the empire and Jamblichus on the suspicion of a secret treasure was dragged before the judge Their mutual enquiries produced the amazing discovery that two centuries were almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from the rage of a Pagan tyrant The bishop of Ephesus  the clergy the magistrates the people and as it is said the emperor Theodosius himself hastened to visit the cavern of the Seven Sleepers who bestowed their benediction related their story and at the same instant peaceably expired The origin of this marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the  modern  Greeks since the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle James of Sarug a Syrian bishop who was born only two years after the death of the younger Theodosius has devoted one of his two hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of Ephesus  James one of the orthodox fathers of the Syrian church

camels to the fairs of Syria is introduced as a divine revelation into the Koran  See Maracci Alcoran Sura xviii tom ii p and tom i part iv p With such an ample privilege Mahomet has not shewn much taste or ingenuity He has invented the dog Al Rakim of the Seven Sleepers the respect of the sun who altered his course twice a day that he might shine into the cavern and the care of God himself who preserved their bodies from putrefaction by turning them to the right and left  The story of the Seven Sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations from Bengal to Africa who profess the Mahometan religion  See d'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p and Renaudot Hist Patriarch Alexandrin p  and some vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the remote extremities of Scandinavia  Paul the deacon of Aquileia de Gestis Langobardorum l i c p edit Grot who lived towards the end of the eighth century has placed in a cavern under a rock on the shore of the ocean the Seven Sleepers of the North whose long repose was respected by the Barbarians Their dress declared them to be Romans and the deacon conjectures that they were reserved by Providence as the future apostles of those unbelieving countries  This easy and universal belief so expressive of the sense of mankind may be ascribed to the genuine merit of the fable itself We imperceptibly advance from youth to age without observing the gradual but incessant change of human affairs and even in our larger experience of history the imagination is accustomed by a perpetual series of causes and effects to unite the most distant revolutions But if the interval between two memorable aeras could be instantly annihilated if it were possible after a momentary slumber of two hundred years to display the  new  world to the eyes of a spectator  who still retained a lively and recent impression of the  old  his surprise and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical romance The scene could not be more advantageously placed than in the two centuries which elapsed between the reigns of Decius and of Theodosius the Younger During this period the seat of government had been transported from Rome to a new city on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude The throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of Christian and orthodox princes who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the Catholic church on the altars of Diana and Hercules The union of the Roman empire was dissolved its genius was humbled in the dust and armies of unknown Barbarians issuing from the frozen regions of the North had established their victorious reign over the fairest provinces of Europe and Africa  CHAP XXXIV  The Character Conquests and Court of Attila King of the

and Bibliotheque Raisonnée tom xvi p  in a fertile country which liberally supplied the wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds In this advantageous situation Rugilas and his valiant brothers who continually added to their power and reputation commanded the alternative of  peace or war with the two empires His alliance with the Romans of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great Aetius who was always secure of finding in the Barbarian camp a hospitable reception and a powerful support At his solicitation and in the name of John the usurper sixty thousand Huns advanced to the confines of Italy their march and their retreat were alike expensive to the state and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the possession of Pannonia to his faithful confederates The Romans of the East were not less apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas which threatened the provinces or even the capital Some ecclesiastical historians have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence  Socrates l vii c Theodoret l v c Tillemont who always depends on the faith of his ecclesiastical authors strenuously contends Hist des Emp tom vi p that the wars and personages were not the same  but Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold and of disguising this dishonourable tribute by the title of general which the king of the Huns condescended to accept The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Barbarians and the perfidious intrigues of the Byzantine court Four dependent nations among whom we may distinguish the Bavarians disclaimed the sovereignty of the Huns and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman alliance till the just claims and formidable  power of Rugilas were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate their decree was ratified by the emperor and two ambassadors were named Plinthas a general of Scythian extraction but of consular rank and the quaestor Epigenes a wise and experienced statesman who was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague  The

ambassadors of Constantinople but as they proudly refused to dismount the business was transacted on horseback in a spacious plain near the city of Margus in the Upper Maesia The kings of the Huns assumed the solid benefits as well as the vain honours of the negociation They dictated the conditions of peace and each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks of the Danube they required that the annual contribution should be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds of gold that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be paid for every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian master that the emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of the Huns and that all the fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of Theodofius  should be delivered to the justice of their offended sovereign This justice was rigorously inflicted on some unfortunate youths of a royal race They were crucified on the territories of the empire by the command of Attila and as soon as the king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror of his name he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany  See Priscus p and Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii c xii xiii

swarthy complexion small deepseated eyes a flat nose a few hairs in the place of a beard broad shoulders and a short square body of nervous strength though of a disproportioned form The haughty step and demeanor of the king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind and he had a custom of  fiercely rolling his eyes as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and indulgent master He delighted in war but after he had ascended the throne in a mature age his head rather than his hand atchieved the conquest of the North and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent and successful general The effects of personal valour are so incosiderable except in poetry or romance that victory even among Barbarians must depend on the degree of skill with which the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a single man The Scythian conquerors Attila and Zingis surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in courage and it may be observed that the monarchies both of the Huns and of the Moguls were erected by their founders on the basis of popular superstition The miraculous conception which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virginmother of Zingis raised him above the level of human nature and the naked prophet who in the name of the Deity invested him with the empire of the earth pointed the

devotion the god of war but as they were incapable of forming either an abstract idea or a corporeal representation they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron cimeter  Nec templum

dominion of the earth  Priscus relates this remarkable story both in his own text p and in the quotation made by Jornandes c p He might have explained the tradition or fable which characterised this famous sword and the name as well as attributes of the Scythian deity whom he has translated into the Mars of the Greeks and Romans  If the rites of Scythia were practised on this solemn occasion a

the shoulder and arm of the victim which they threw up into the air and drew omens and presages from the manner of their falling on the pile  Whether human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila or whether he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered in the field of battle the favourite of Mars soon acquired a sacred character which rendered his conquests more easy and more permanent and the Barbarian princes confessed in the language of devotion or flattery that they could not presume to gaze with a steady eye on the divine majesty of the king of the Huns  Priscus p A more civilized hero Augustus himself was pleased if the person on whom he fixed his eyes seemed unable to support their divine lustre Sueton in August c  His brother Bleda who reigned over a considerable part of the nation was compelled to resign his sceptre and his life Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural impulse and the vigour with which Attila wielded the sword of Mars convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his invincible arm  The count de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii p attempts to clear Attila from the murder of his brother and is almost inclined to reject the concurrent testimony of Jornandes and the contemporary Chronicles  But the extent of his empire affords the only remaining evidence of the number  and importance of his victories and the Scythian monarch however ignorant of the value of science and philosophy might perhaps lament that his illiterate subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the memory of his exploits  If a line of separation were drawn between the  and acquires the empire of Scythia and Germany  civilized and the savage climates of the globe between the inhabitants of cities who cultivated the earth and the hunters and shepherds who dwelt in tents Attila might aspire to the title of supreme and sole monarch of the Barbarians  Fortissimarum gentium dominus qui inauditâ ante se potentiâ solus Scythica et Germanica regna possedit Jornandes c p Priscus p M de Guignes by his knowledge of the Chinese has acquired tom ii p an adequate idea of the empire of Attila  He alone among the conquerors of ancient and modern times united the two mighty kingdoms of Germany and Scythia and those vague appellations when they are applied to his reign may be understood with an ample latitude Thuringia which stretched beyond its actual limits as far as the Danube was in the number of his provinces he interposed with the weight of a powerful neighbour in the domestic affairs of the Franks and one of his lieutenants chastised and almost exterminated the Burgundians of the Rhine He subdued the islands of the ocean the kingdoms of Scandinavia encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic and the Huns might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region which has been protected from all other  conquerors by the severity of the climate and the courage of the natives Towards the East it is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts yet we may be assured that he reigned on the banks of the Volga that the king of the Huns was dreaded not only as a warrior but as a magician  See Hist des Huns tom ii p The Geougen believed that the Huns could excite at pleasure storms of wind and rain This phaenomenon was produced by the stone  Gezi  to whose magic power the loss of a battle was ascribed by the Mahometan Tartars of the fourteenth century See Cherefeddin Ali Hist de Timur Bec tom i p  that he insulted and vanquished the Khan of the formidable Geougen and that he sent ambassadors to negociate an equal alliance with the empire of China In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the sovereignty of Attila and who never entertained during his lifetime the thought of a revolt the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths were distinguished by their numbers their bravery and the personal merit of their chiefs The renowned Ardaric king of the Gepidae was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the monarch who esteemed his intrepid genius whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir king of the Ostrogoths The crowd of vulgar kings the leaders of so many martial tribes who served under the standard of Attila were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the person of their master They watched his nod they trembled at his frown and at the first signal of his will  they executed without murmur or hesitation his stern and absolute commands In time of peace the dependent princes with their national troops attended the royal camp in regular succession but when Attila collected his military force he was able to bring into the field an army of five or according to another account of seven hundred thousand Barbarians  Jornandes c p c p See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p Corneille has represented the pride of Attila to his subject kings and his tragedy opens with these two ridiculous lines  Ils ne sont pas venus nos deux rois qu'on leur die  Qu'ils se font trop attendre et qu'Attila s'ennuie  The two kings of the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths are profound politicians and sentimental lovers and the whole piece exhibits the defects without the genius of the poet    The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken  The Huns invade Persia A

dances of the citizens of Antioch Egypt trembled at their approach and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy embarkation The memory of this invasion was still recent in the minds of the Orientals The subjects of Attila might execute with superior forces the design which these adventurers had so boldly attempted and it soon became the subject of anxious conjecture whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of Rome or of Persia Some of the great vassals of the king of the Huns who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes had been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor or rather with the general of the West They related during their residence at Rome the circumstances of an expedition which they had lately made into the East After passing a desert and a morass supposed by the Romans to be the lake Moeotis they penetrated through the mountains and arrived at the end of fifteen days march on the confines of Media where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and Cursic They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media and the air according to their own expression  was darkened by a cloud of arrows But the Huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the enemy Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road they lost the greatest part of their booty and at length returned to the royal camp with some knowledge of the country and an impatient desire of revenge In the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors who discussed at the court of Attila the character and designs of their formidable enemy the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan The more sagacious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a hope and convinced them  that  the Medes and Persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the Huns and  that  the easy and important acquisition would exalt the pride as well as power of the conqueror Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution and a military title which equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans who would then be encompassed on all sides by the empire of the Huns  See the original conversation in Priscus p    While the powers of Europe and Asia were  They attack the Eastern empire A D c  solicitous to avert the impending danger the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals in the  possession of Africa An enterprise had been concerted between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople for the recovery of that valuable province and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military and naval forces of Theodosius But the subtle Genseric who spread his negociations round the world prevented their designs by exciting the king of the Huns to invade the Eastern empire and a trifling incident soon became the motive or pretence of a destructive war  Priscus p His history contained a copious and elegant account of the war Evagrius l i c but the extracts which relate to the embassies are the only parts that have reached our times The original work was accessible however to the writers from whom we borrow our imperfect knowledge Jornandes Theophanes Count Marcellinus ProsperTyro and the author of the Alexandrian or Paschal Chronicle M de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii c xv has examined the cause the circumstances and the duration of this war and will not allow it to extend beyond the year four hundred and fortyfour  Under the faith of the treaty of Margus a free market was held on the northern side of the Danube which was protected by a Roman fortress surnamed Constantia A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial security killed or dispersed the unsuspecting traders and levelled the fortress with the ground The Huns justified this outrage as an act of reprisal alleged that the bishop of Margus had entered their territories to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings and sternly demanded the guilty prelate the sacrilegious spoil and the fugitive subjects who had escaped from the justice of Attila The refusal of the Byzantine  court was the signal of war and the Maesians at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign But they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and the adjacent towns and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim that a private citizen however innocent or respectable may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his country The bishop of Margus who did not possess the spirit of a martyr resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns secured by solemn oaths his pardon and reward posted a numerous detachment of Barbarians in silent ambush on the banks of the Danube and at the appointed hour opened with his own hand the gates of his episcopal city This advantage which had been obtained by treachery served as a prelude to more honourable and decisive victories The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and fortresses and though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower with a small garrison they were commonly sufficient to repel or to intercept the inroads of an enemy who was ignorant of the art and impatient of the delay of a regular siege But these slight obstacles were instantly swept away by the inundation of the Huns  Procopius de Edificiis l iv c These fortresses were afterwards restored strengthened and enlarged by the emperor Justinian but they were soon destroyed by the Abares who succeeded to the power and possessions of the Huns  They destroyed with fire and sword the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum  of Ratiaria and Marcianapolis of Naissus and Sardica where every circumstance in the discipline of the people and the construction of the buildings had been gradually adapted to the sole purpose of defence The whole breadth  and ravage Europe as far as Constantinople  of Europe as it extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the Hadriatic was at once invaded and occupied and desolated by the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field The public danger and distress could not however provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion or to appear in person at the head of the Roman legions But the troops which had been sent against Genseric were hastily recalled from Sicily the garrisons on the side of Persia were exhausted and a military force was collected in Europe formidable by their arms and numbers if the generals had understood the science of command and their soldiers the duty of obedience The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements and the progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle The two former on the banks of the Utus and under the walls of Marcianapolis were fought in the extensive plains between the Danube and Mount Haemus As the Romans were pressed by a victorious enemy they gradually and unskilfully retired towards the Chersonesus of Thrace and that narrow peninsula the last extremity of the land was marked by their third and irreparable defeat By the destruction of  this army Attila acquired the indisputable possession of the field From the Hellespont to Thermopylae and the suburbs of Constantinople he ravaged without resistance and without mercy the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia Heraclea and Hadrianople might perhaps escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns but the words the most expressive of total extirpation and erasure are applied to the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the Eastern empire  Septuaginta civitates says ProsperTyro depraedatione vastatae The language of count Marcellinus is still more forcible Pene totam Europam invasis  excisisque  civitatibus atque castellis  conrasit  Theodosius his court and the unwarlike people were protected by the walls of Constantinople but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake and the fall of fiftyeight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach The damage indeed was speedily repaired but this accident was aggravated by a superstitious fear that Heaven itself had delivered the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia who were strangers to the laws the language and the religion of the Romans  Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p has paid great attention to this memorable earthquake which was felt as far from Constantinople as Antioch and Alexandria and is celebrated by all the ecclesiastical writers In the hands of a popular preacher an earthquake is an engine of admirable effect    In all their invasions of the civilized empires  The Scythian or Tartar wars  of the South the Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and destructive spirit The laws of war that restrain the exercise  of national rapine and murder are founded on two principles of substantial interest the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest and a just apprehension lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy's country may be retaliated on our own But these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of nations The Huns of Attila may without injustice be compared to the Moguls and Tartars before their primitive manners were changed by religion and luxury and the evidence of Oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals of Rome After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of China it was seriously proposed not in the hour of victory and passion but in calm deliberate council to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country that the vacant land might be converted to the pasture of cattle The firmness of a Chinese mandarin  He represented to the emperor of the Moguls that the four provinces Petcheli Chantong Chansi and Leaotong which he already possessed might annually produce under a mild administration ounces of silver measures of rice and pieces of silk Gaubil Hist de la Dynastie des Mongous p Yelutchousay such was the name of the mandarin was a wise and virtuous minister who saved his country and civilized the conquerors See p  who insinuated some principles of rational policy into the mind of Zingis diverted him from the execution of this horrid design But in the cities of Asia which yielded to the Moguls the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with a regular  form of discipline which may with equal reason though not with equal authority be imputed to the victorious Huns The inhabitants who had submitted to their discretion were ordered to evacuate their houses and to assemble in some plain adjacent to the city where a division was made of the vanquished into three parts The first class consisted of the soldiers of the garrison and of the young men capable of bearing arms and their fate was instantly decided they were either inlisted among the Moguls or they were massacred on the spot by the troops who with pointed spears and bended bows had formed a circle round the captive multitude The second class composed of the young and beautiful women of the artificers of every rank and profession and of the more wealthy or honourable citizens from whom a private ransom might be expected was distributed in equal or proportionable lots The remainder whose life or death was alike useless to the conquerors were permitted to return to the city which in the mean while had been stripped of its valuable furniture and a tax was imposed on those wretched inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air Such was the behaviour of the Moguls when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigour  Particular instances would be endless but the curious reader may consult the life of Gengiscan by Petit de la Croix the Histoire des Mongous and the fifteenth book of the History of the Huns  But the most casual provocation the slightest motive of caprice or convenience often provoked them to involve a whole people in  an indiscriminate massacre and the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such unrelenting perseverance that according to their own expression horses might run without stumbling over the ground where they had once stood The three great capitals of Khorasan Maru Neisabour and Herat were destroyed by the armies of Zingis and the exact account which was taken of the slain amounted to four millions three hundred and fortyseven thousand persons  At Maru at Herat at Neisabour D'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p I use the orthography of d'Anville's maps It must however be allowed that the Persians were disposed to exaggerate their losses and the Moguls to magnify their exploits  Timur or Tamerlane was educated in a less barbarous age and in the profession of the Mahometan religion yet if Attila equalled the hostile ravages of Tamerlane  Cherefeddin Ali his servile panegyrist would afford us many horrid examples In his camp before Delhi Timur massacred Indian prisoners who had  smiled  when the army of

depopulated the provinces of the empire by the number of Roman subjects whom  State of the captives  they led away into captivity In the hands of a wise legislator such an industrious colony might have contributed to diffuse through the deserts of Scythia the rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts but these captives who had been taken in war were accidentally dispersed among the hords that obeyed the empire of Attila The estimate of their respective value was formed by the simple judgment of unenlightened and unprejudiced Barbarians Perhaps they might not understand the merit of a theologian profoundly skilled in the controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation yet they respected the ministers of every religion and the active zeal of the Christian missionaries without approaching the person or the palace of the monarch successfully laboured in the propagation of the gospel  The missionaries of St Chrysostom had converted great numbers of the Scythians who dwelt beyond the Danube in tents and waggons Theodoret l v c Photius p The Mahometans the Nestorians and the Latin Christians thought themselves secure of gaining the sons and grandsons of Zingis who treated the rival missionaries with impartial favour  The pastoral tribes who were ignorant of the distinction of landed property must have disregarded the use as well as the abuse of civil jurisprudence and the skill of an eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their abhorrence  The Germans who exterminated Varus and his legions had been particularly offended with the Roman laws and lawyers One of the Barbarians after the effectual precautions of cutting out the tongue of an advocate and sewing up his mouth observed with much satisfaction that the viper could no longer hiss Florus iv  The perpetual  intercourse of the Huns and the Goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national dialects and the Barbarians were ambitious of conversing in Latin the military idiom even of the Eastern empire  Priscus p It should seem that the Huns preferred the Gothic and Latin languages to their own which was probably a harsh and barren idiom  But they disdained the language and the sciences of the Greeks and the vain sophist or grave philosopher who had enjoyed the flattering applause of the schools was mortified to find that his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance than himself The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed as they tended to satisfy the wants of the Huns An architect in the service of Onegesius one of the favourites of Attila was employed to construct a bath but this work was a rare example of private luxury and the trades of the smith the carpenter the armourer were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with the useful instruments of peace and war But the merit of the physician was received with universal favour and respect the Barbarians who despised death might be apprehensive of disease and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive to whom he ascribed perhaps an imaginary power of prolonging or  preserving his life  Philip de Comines in his admirable picture of the last moments of Lewis XI Memoires l vi c represents the insolence of his physician who in five months extorted crowns and a rich bishopric from the stern avaricious tyrant  The Huns might be provoked to insult the misery of their slaves over whom they exercised a despotic command  Priscus p extols the equity of the Roman laws which protected the life of a slave Occidere solent says Tacitus of the Germans non disciplinâ et severitate sed impetu et irâ ut inimicum nisi quòd impune De Moribus Germ c The Heruli who were the subjects of Attila claimed and exercised the power of life and death over their slaves See a remarkable instance in the second book of Agathias  but their manners were not susceptible of a refined system of oppression and the efforts of courage and diligence were often recompensed by the gift of freedom The historian Priscus whose embassy is a source of curious instruction was accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger who saluted him in the Greek language but whose dress and figure displayed the appearance of a wealthy Scythian In the siege of Viminiacum he had lost according to his own account his fortune and liberty he became the slave of Onegesius but his faithful services against the Romans and the Acatzires had gradually raised him to the rank of the native Huns to whom he was attached by the domestic pledges of a new wife and several children The spoils of war had restored and improved his private property he was admitted to the table of his former lord and the apostate Greek blessed the hour of his captivity since it had been the introduction to  an happy and independent state which he held by the honourable tenure of military service This reflection naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the Roman government which was severely arraigned by the apostate and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation The freedman of Onegesius exposed in true and lively colours the vices of a declining empire of which he had so long been the victim the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence the intolerable weight of taxes rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings the partial administration of justice and the universal corruption which increased the influence of the rich and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor A sentiment of patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of the fortunate exile and he lamented with a flood of tears the guilt or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the wisest and most salutary institutions  See the whole conversation in Priscus p    The timid or selfish policy of the western  Treaty of peace between Attila and the Eastern empire A D  Romans had abandoned the Eastern empire to the Huns  Nova iterum Orienti assurgit ruina quum nulla ab Occidentalibus ferrentur auxilia ProsperTyro composed his Chronicle in the West and his observation implies a censure  The loss of armies and the want of  discipline or virtue were not supplied by the personal character of the monarch Theodosius might still affect the style as well as the title of  Invincible Augustus  but he was reduced to solicit the clemency of Attila who imperiously dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace I The emperor of the East resigned by an express or tacit convention an extensive and important territory which stretched along the southern banks of the Danube from Singidunum or Belgrade as far as Novae in the diocese of Thrace The breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen days journey but from the proposal of Attila to remove the situation of the national market it soon appeared that he comprehended the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of his dominions II The king of the Huns required and obtained that his tribute or subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of two thousand one hundred and he stipulated the immediate payment of six thousand pounds of gold to defray the expences or to expiate the guilt of the war One might imagine that such a demand which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the East and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished or at least of the disorderly state of the finances A large proportion of the taxes extorted from the people was detained and intercepted in their passage through the foulest  channels to the treasury of Constantinople The revenue was dissipated by Theodosius and his favourites in wasteful and profuse luxury which was disguised by the names of Imperial magnificence or Christian charity The immediate supplies had been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military preparations A personal contribution rigorously but capriciously imposed on the members of the senatorian order was the only expedient that could disarm without loss of time the impatient avarice of Attila and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to public auction the jewels of their wives and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces  According to the description or rather invective of Chrysostom an auction of Byzantine luxury must have been very productive Every wealthy house possessed a semicircular table of massy silver such as two men could scarcely lift a vase of solid gold of the weight of forty pounds cups dishes of the same metal c  III The king of the Huns appears to have established as a principle of national jurisprudence that he could never lose the property which he had once acquired in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary or reluctant submission to his authority From this principle he concluded and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws that the Huns who had been taken prisoners in war should be released without delay and without ransom that every Roman captive who had presumed to escape should purchase his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold and that all the Barbarians  who had deserted the standard of Attila should be restored without any promise or stipulation of pardon In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty the Imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble deserters who refused to devote themselves to certain death and the Romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of any Scythian people by this public confession that they were destitute either of faith or power to protect the suppliants who had embraced the throne of Theodosius  The articles of the treaty expressed without much order or precision may be found in Priscus p c Count Marcellinus dispenses some comfort by observing st  That  Attila himself solicited the peace and presents which he had formerly refused and dly  That  about the same time the ambassadors of India presented a fine large tame tyger to the emperor Theodosius    The firmness of a single town so obscure  Spirit of the Azimuntines  that except on this occasion it has never been mentioned by any historian or geographer exposed

de Edificiis l iv c xi tom ii p edit Paris there is one of the name of  Esimontou  whose position is doubtfully marked in the neighbourhood of Anchialus and the Euxine Sea The name and walls of Azimuntium might subsist till the reign of Justinian but the race of its brave defenders had been carefully extirpated by the jealousy of the Roman princes  had been distinguished by the martial spirit of its youth the skill and reputation of the leaders whom they had chosen and their daring exploits against the innumerable host of the Barbarians Instead of tamely expecting  their approach the Azimuntines attacked in frequent and successful sallies the troops of the Huns who gradually declined the dangerous neighbourhood rescued from their hands the spoil and the captives and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary association of fugitives and deserters After the conclusion of the treaty Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war unless the Azimuntines were persuaded or compelled to comply with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted The ministers of Theodosius confessed with shame and with truth that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of men who so bravely asserted their natural independence and the king of the Huns condescended to negociate an equal exchange with the citizens of Azimus They demanded the restitution of some shepherds who with their cattle had been accidentally surprised A strict though fruitless inquiry was allowed but the Huns were obliged to swear that they did not detain any prisoners belonging to the city before they could recover two surviving countrymen whom the Azimuntines had reserved as pledges for the safety of their lost companions Attila on his side was satisfied and deceived by their solemn asseveration that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword and that it was their constant practice immediately to dismiss the Romans and the deserters who had obtained the security of the public faith This prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned or excused by the casuists as they incline to the  rigid decree of St Augustin or to the milder sentiment of St Jerom and St Chrysostom but every soldier every statesman must acknowledge that if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and multiplied the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the majesty of the empire  The peevish dispute of St Jerom and St Augustin who laboured by different expedients to reconcile the  seeming  quarrel of the two apostles St Peter and St Paul depends on the solution of an important question Middleton's Works vol ii p which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and Protestant divines and even by lawyers and philosophers of every age    It would have been strange indeed if Theodosius  Embassies from Attila to Constantinople  had purchased by the loss of honour a secure and solid tranquillity or if his tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries The Byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies  Montesquien Considerations sur la Grandeur c c xix has delineated with a bold and easy pencil some of the most striking circumstances of the pride of Attila and the disgrace of the Romans He deserves the praise of having read the Fragments of Priscus which have been too much disregarded  and the ministers of Attila were uniformly instructed to press the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty to produce the names of fugitives and deserters who were still protected by the empire and to declare with seeming moderation that unless their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction it would be impossible for him were it even his wish to check the resentment of his warlike tribes Besides the motives of pride and interest which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue this train of negociation he  was influenced by the less honourable view of enriching his favourites at the expence of his enemies The Imperial treasury was exhausted to procure the friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal attendants whose favourable report might conduce to the maintenance of peace The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the liberal reception of his ministers he computed with pleasure the value and splendour of their gifts rigorously exacted the performance of every promise which would contribute to their private emolument and treated as an important business of state the marriage of his secretary Constantius  See Priscus p c I would fain believe that this adventurer was afterwards crucified by the order of Attila on a suspicion of treasonable practices but Priscus p has too plainly distinguished  two  persons of the name of Constantius who from the similar events of their lives might have been easily confounded  That Gallic adventurer who was recommended by Aetius to the king of the Huns had engaged his service to the ministers of Constantinople for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife and the daughter of count Saturninus was chosen to discharge the obligations of her country The reluctance of the victim some domestic troubles and the unjust confiscation of her fortune cooled the ardour of her interested lover but he still demanded in the name of Attila an equivalent alliance and after many ambiguous delays and excuses the Byzantine court was compelled to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of Armatius whose birth opulence and beauty placed her in the most  illustrious rank of the Roman matrons For these importunate and oppressive embassies Attila claimed a suitable return he weighed with suspicious pride the character and station of the Imperial envoys but he condescended to promise that he would advance as far as Sardica to receive any ministers who had been invested with the consular dignity The council of Theodosius eluded this proposal by representing the desolate and ruined condition of Sardica and even ventured to insinuate that every officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the most powerful princes of Scythia Maximin  In the Persian treaty concluded in the year

returned at the same time from Constantinople to the royal camp Their obscure names were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contrast of their sons the two servants of Attila

and horses made their first halt at Sardica at the distance of three hundred and fifty miles or thirteen days journey from Constantinople As the remains of Sardica were still included within the limits of the empire it was incumbent on the Romans to exercise the duties of hospitality They provided with the assistance of the provincials a sufficient number of sheep and oxen and invited the Huns to a splendid or at least a plentiful supper But the harmony of the entertainment was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion The greatness of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their ministers the Huns with equal ardour asserted the superiority of their victorious monarch the dispute was inflamed by the rash and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius who passionately rejected the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius and it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus  were able to divert the conversation or to soothe the angry minds of the Barbarians When they rose from table the Imperial ambassador presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and Indian pearls which they thankfully accepted Yet Orestes could not forbear insinuating that  he  had not always been treated with such respect and liberality and the offensive distinction which was implied between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend and Orestes an irreconcileable enemy After this entertainment they travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus That flourishing city which had given birth to the great Constantine was levelled with the ground the inhabitants were destroyed or dispersed and the appearance of some sick persons who were still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches served only to increase the horror of the prospect The surface of the country was covered with the bones of the slain and the ambassadors who directed their course to the northwest were obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia before they descended into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the Danube The Huns were masters of the great river their navigation was performed in large canoes hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree the ministers of Theodosius were safely landed on the opposite bank and their Barbarian associates immediately hastened to the camp of Attila which was equally prepared for the amusements of  hunting or of war No sooner had Maximin advanced about two miles from the Danube than he began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror He was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley lest he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal mansion The ministers of Attila pressed him to communicate the business and the instructions which he reserved for the ear of their sovereign When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations he was still more confounded to find that the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory those secrets says Priscus which should not be revealed to the gods themselves had been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy On his refusal to comply with such ignominious terms the Imperial envoy was commanded instantly to depart the order was recalled it was again repeated and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin At length by the intercession of Scotta the brother of Onegesius whose friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift he was admitted to the royal presence but instead of obtaining a decisive answer he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards the North that Attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of receiving in the same camp the ambassadors of the Eastern and Western empires His journey was regulated by the guides who obliged him to halt to hasten his march or to deviate from the common road as it best suited  the convenience of the King The Romans who traversed the plains of Hungary suppose that they passed  several  navigable rivers either in canoes or portable boats but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of the Teyss or Tibiscus might present itself in different places under different names From the contiguous villages they received a plentiful and regular supply of provisions mead instead of wine millet in the place of bread and a certain liquor named  camus  which according to the report of Priscus was distilled from barley  The Huns themselves still continued to despise the labours of agriculture they abused the privilege of a victorious nation and the Goths their industrious subjects who cultivated the earth dreaded their neighbourhood like that of so many ravenous wolves Priscus p In the same manner the Sarts and Tadgies provide for their own subsistence and for that of the Usbec Tartars their lazy and rapacious sovereigns See Genealogical History of the Tartars p c  Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople but in their accidental distress they were relieved by the gentleness and hospitality of the same Barbarians so terrible and so merciless in war The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large morass A violent tempest of wind and rain of thunder and lightning overturned their tents immersed their baggage and furniture in the water and scattered their retinue who wandered in the darkness of the night uncertain of their road and apprehensive of some unknown danger till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighbouring village the property of the  widow of Bleda A bright illumination and in a few moments a comfortable fire of reeds was kindled by their officious benevolence the wants and even the desires of the Romans were liberally satisfied and they seem to have been embarrassed by the singular politeness of Bleda's widow who added to her other favours the gift or at least the loan of a sufficient number of beautiful and obsequious damsels The sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to repose to collect and dry the baggage and to the refreshment of the men and horses but in the evening before they pursued their journey the ambassadors expressed their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village by a very acceptable present of silver cups red fleeces dried fruits and Indian pepper Soon after this adventure they rejoined the march of Attila from whom they had been separated about six days and slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire which did not contain in the space of several thousand miles a single city  As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure  The royal village and palace  geography of Priscus this capital appears to have been seated between the Danube the Teyss and the Carpathian hills in the plains of Upper Hungary and most probably in the neighbourhood of Jazberin Agria or Tokay  It is evident that Priscus passed the Danube and the Teyss and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian hills Agria Tokay and Jazberin are situated in the plains circumscribed by this definition M de Buat Histoire des Peuples c tom vii p has chosen Tokay Otrokosci p apud Mascou ix a learned Hungarian has preferred Jazberin a place about thirtysix miles westward of Buda and the Danube  In  its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp which by the long and frequent residence of Attila had insensibly swelled into a huge village for the reception of his court of the troops who followed his person and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and retainers  The royal village of Attila may be compared to the city of Karacorum the residence of the successors of Zingis which though it appears to have been a more stable habitation did not equal the size or splendor of the town and abbey of St Denys in the th century see Rubruquis in the Historie Generale des Voyages tom vii p The camp of Aurengzebe as it is so agreeably described by Bernier tom ii p blended the manners of Scythia with the magnificence and luxury of Hindostan  The baths constructed by Onegesius were the only edifice of stone the materials had been transported from Pannonia and since the adjacent country was destitute even of large timber it may be presumed that the meaner habitations of the royal village consisted of straw of mud or of canvas The wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns were built and adorned with rude magnificence according to the rank the fortune or the taste of the proprietors They seem to have been distributed with some degree of order and symmetry and each spot became more honourable as it approached the person of the sovereign The palace of Attila which surpassed all other houses in his dominions was built entirely of wood and covered an ample space of ground The outward enclosure was a lofty wall or pallisade of smooth square timber intersected with high towers but intended rather for ornament than defence This wall which seems to  have encircled the declivity of a hill comprehended a great variety of wooden edifices adapted to the uses of royalty A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of Attila and instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement imposed by Asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the Roman ambassadors to their presence their table and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace When Maximin offered his presents to Cerca the principal queen he admired the singular architecture of her mansion the height of the round columns the size and beauty of the wood which was curiously shaped or turned or polished or carved and his attentive eye was able to discover some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the proportions After passing through the guards who watched before the gate the ambassadors were introduced into the private apartment of Cerca The wife of Attila received their visit sitting or rather lying on a soft couch the floor was covered with a carpet the domestics formed a circle round the queen and her damsels seated on the ground were employed in working the variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric warriors The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories the trappings of their horses their swords and even their shoes were studded with gold and precious stones and their tables were profusely spread with plates and goblets and vases of gold and silver which had  been fashioned by the labour of Grecian artists The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors  When the Moguls displayed the spoils of Asia in the diet of Toncat the throne of Zingis was still covered with the original black felt carpet on which he had been seated when he was raised to the command of his warlike countrymen See Vie de Gengiscan l iv c  The dress of Attila his arms and the furniture of his horse were plain without ornament and of a single colour The royal table was served in wooden cups and platters flesh was his only food and the conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread  When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the banks of the Danube his tent  The behaviour of Attila to the Roman ambassadors  was encompassed with a formidable guard The monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair His stern countenance angry gestures and impatient tone astonished the firmness of Maximin but Vigilius had more reason to tremble since he distinctly understood the menace that if Attila did not respect the law of nations he would nail the deceitful interpreter to a cross and leave his body to the vultures The Barbarian condescended by producing an accurate list to expose the bold falsehood of Vigilius who had affirmed that no more than seventeen deserters could be found But he arrogantly declared that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending with his fugitive slaves since he despised their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which Theodofius had entrusted to their arms  "For what fortress" added Attila "what city in the wide extent of the Roman empire can hope to exist secure and impregnable if it is our pleasure that it should be erazed from the earth"  He dismissed however the interpreter who returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete restitution and a more splendid embassy His anger gradually subsided and his domestic satisfaction in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of Eslam might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his temper The entrance of Attila into the royal village was marked by a very singular ceremony A numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero and their king They marched before him distributed into long and regular files the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins who chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language The wife of his favourite Onegesius with a train of female attendants saluted Attila at the door of her own house on his way to the palace and offered according to the custom of the country her respectful homage by intreating him to taste the wine and meat which she had prepared for his reception As soon as the monarch had graciously accepted her hospitable gift his domestics lifted a small silver table to a convenient height as he sat on horseback and Attila  when he had touched the goblet with his lips again saluted the wife of Onegesius and continued his march During his residence at the seat of empire his hours were not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio and the king of the Huns could maintain his superior dignity without concealing his person from the public view He frequently assembled his council and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations and his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal which he held at stated times and according to the eastern custom before the principal gate of his wooden palace The Romans both of the East and of the West were twice invited to the banquets where Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia Maximin  The royal feast  and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold till they had made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the Huns and were conducted after this ceremony to their respective seats in a spacious hall The royal table and couch covered with carpets and fine linen was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall and a son an uncle or perhaps a favourite king were admitted to share the simple and homely repast of Attila Two lines of small tables each of which contained three or four guests were ranged in order on either hand the right was esteemed the most honourable but the Romans ingenuously confess that they were placed on the left and that Beric an unknown chieftain most probably of the Gothic race preceded  the representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian The Barbarian monarch received from his cupbearer a goblet filled with wine and courteously drank to the health of the most distinguished guest who rose from his seat and expressed in the same manner his loyal and respectful vows This ceremony was successively performed for all or at least for the illustrious persons of the assembly and a considerable time must have been consumed since it was thrice repeated as each course of service was placed on the table But the wine still remained after the meat had been removed and the Huns continued to indulge their intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet Yet before they retired they enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation in their convivial amusements Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila and recited the verses which they had composed to celebrate his valour and his victories A profound silence prevailed in the hall and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal harmony which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits a martial ardour flashed from the eyes of the warriors who were impatient for battle and the tears of the old men expressed their generous despair that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field  If we may believe Plutarch in Demetrio tom v p it was the custom of the Scythians when they indulged in the pleasures of the table to awaken their languid courage by the martial harmony of twanging their bowstrings  This entertainment which might be  considered as a school of military virtue was succeeded by a farce that debased the dignity of human nature A Moorish and a Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of the rude spectators by their deformed figure ridiculous dress antic gestures absurd speeches and the strange unintelligible confusion of the Latin the Gothic and the Hunnic languages and the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter In the midst of this intemperate riot Attila alone without a change of countenance maintained his stedfast and inflexible gravity which was never relaxed except on the entrance of Irnac the youngest of his sons he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal tenderness gently pinched him by the cheek and betrayed a partial affection which was justified by the assurance of his prophets that Irnac would be the future support of his family and empire Two days afterwards the ambassadors received a second invitation and they had reason to praise the politeness as well as the hospitality of Attila The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty reproaches and he was provoked by a motive of interest to support with unbecoming zeal the private claims of his secretary Constantius  "The emperor" said Attila "has long promised him a rich wife Constantius must not be disappointed nor should a Roman emperor deserve the name of liar"  On the third day the ambassadors  were dismissed the freedom of several captives was granted for a moderate ransom to their pressing entreaties and besides the royal presents they were permitted to accept from each of the Scythian nobles the honourable and useful gift of a horse Maximin returned by the same road to Constantinople and though he was involved in an accidental dispute with Beric the new ambassador of Attila he flattered himself that he had contributed by the laborious journey to confirm the peace and alliance of the two nations  The curious narrative of this embassy which required few observations and was not susceptible of any collateral evidence may be found in Priscus p But I have not confined myself to the same order and I had previously extracted the historical circumstances which were less intimately connected with the journey and business of the Roman ambassadors    But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the  Conspiracy of the Romans against the life of Attila  treacherous design which had been concealed under the mask of the public faith The surprise and satisfaction of Edecon when he contemplated the splendour of Constantinople had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch Chrysaphius  M de Tillemont has very properly given the succession of Chamberlains who reigned in the name of Theodosius Chrysaphius was the last and according to the unanimous evidence of history the worst of these favourites see Hist des Empereurs tom vi p Mem Eccles tom xv p His partiality for his godfather the heresiarch Eutyches engaged him to persecute the orthodox party  who governed the emperor and the empire After some previous conversation and a mutual oath of secrecy the eunuch who had not from his  own feelings or experience imbibed any exalted notions of ministerial virtue ventured to propose the death of Attila as an important service by which Edecon might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he admired The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting offer and professed with apparent zeal his ability as well as readiness to execute the bloody deed the design was communicated to the master of the offices and the devout Theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible enemy But this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the dissimulation or the repentance of Edecon and though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason which he seemed to approve he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and voluntary confession If we  now  review the embassy of Maximin and the behaviour of Attila we must applaud the Barbarian who respected the laws of hospitality and generously entertained and dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his life But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more extraordinary since he returned conscious of his guilt and danger to the royal camp accompanied by his son and carrying with him a weighty purse of gold which the favourite eunuch had furnished to satisfy the demands of Edecon and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards The interpreter was instantly seized and dragged before the tribunal of Attila where he asserted his innocence with specious firmness till the  threat of inflicting instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of the criminal transaction Under the name of ransom or confiscation the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred pounds of gold for the life of a traitor whom he disdained to punish He pointed his just indignation against a nobler object His ambassadors Eslaw and Orestes were  He reprimands and forgives the Emperor  immediately dispatched to Constantinople with a peremptory instruction which it was much safer for them to execute than to disobey They boldly entered the Imperial presence with the fatal purse hanging down from the neck of Orestes who interrogated the eunuch Chrysaphius as he stood beside the throne whether he recognised the evidence of his guilt But the office of reproof was reserved for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw who gravely addressed the Emperor of the East in the following words  "Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent Attila likewise is descended from a noble race and  he  has supported by his actions the dignity which he inherited from his father Mundzuk But Theodosius has forfeited his paternal honours and by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to the condition of a slave It is therefore just that he should reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him instead of attempting like a wicked slave clandestinely to conspire against his master"  The son of Arcadius who was accustomed only to the voice of flattery heard  with astonishment the severe language of truth he blushed and trembled nor did he presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius which Eslaw and Orestes were instructed to demand A solemn embassy armed with full powers and magnificent gifts was hastily sent to deprecate the wrath of Attila and his pride was gratified by the choice of Nomius and Anatolius two ministers of consular or patrician rank of whom the one was great treasurer and the other was mastergeneral of the armies of the East He condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the river Drenco and though he at first affected a stern and haughty demeanor his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence and liberality He condescended to pardon the emperor the eunuch and the interpreter bound himself by an oath to observe the conditions of peace released a great number of captives abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate and resigned a large territory to the south of the Danube which he had already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants But this treaty was purchased at an expence which might have supported a vigorous and successful war and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled to redeem the safety of a worthless favourite by oppressive taxes which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction  This secret conspiracy and its important consequences may be traced in the fragments of Priscus p The chronology of that historian is not fixed by any precise date but the series of negociations between Attila and the Eastern empire must be included within the three or four years which are terminated A D by the death of Theodosius    The emperor Theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating circumstance of an inglorious life As he was riding or hunting in the  Theodosius the Younger dies A D July  neighbourhood of Constantinople he was thrown from his horse into the river Lycus the spine of the back was injured by the fall and he expired some days afterwards in the fiftieth year of his age and the fortythird of his reign  Theodorus the Reader see Vales Hist Eccles tom iii p and the Paschal Chronicle mention the fall without specifying the injury but the consequence was so likely to happen and so unlikely to be invented that we may safely give credit to Nicephorus Callistus a Greek of the fourteenth century  His sister Pulcheria whose authority had been controuled both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the eunuchs was unanimously proclaimed Empress of the East and the Romans for the first time submitted to a female reign No sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne than she indulged her own and the public resentment by an act of popular justice Without any legal trial the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed before the gates of the city and the immense riches which had been accumulated by the rapacious favourite served only to hasten and to justify his punishment  Pulcheriae nutû says Count Marcellinus suâ cum avaritiâ interemptus est She abandoned the eunuch to the pious revenge of a son whose father had suffered at his instigation  Amidst the general acclamations of the clergy and people the empress did not forget the prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed and she  wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a colleague who would always respect the superior rank and virgin chastity of his wife She gave her hand to Marcian a senator about  and is succeeded by Marcian Aug  sixty years of age and the nominal husband of Pulcheria was solemnly invested with the Imperial purple The zeal which he displayed for the orthodox creed as it was established by the council of Chalcedon would alone have inspired the grateful eloquence of the Catholics But the behaviour of Marcian in a private life and afterwards on the throne may support a more rational belief that he was qualified to restore and invigorate an empire which had been almost dissolved by the successive weakness of two hereditary monarchs He was born in Thrace and educated to the profession of arms but Marcian's youth had been severely exercised by poverty and misfortune since his only resource when he first arrived at Constantinople consisted in two hundred pieces of gold which he had borrowed of a friend He passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of Aspar and his son Ardaburius followed those powerful generals to the Persian and African wars and obtained by their influence the honourable rank of tribune and senator His mild disposition and useful talents without alarming the jealousy recommended Marcian to the esteem and favour of his patrons he had seen perhaps he had felt the abuses of a venal and oppressive administration and his own example gave weight and  energy to the laws which he promulgated for the reformation of manners  Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c Evagrius l ii c Theophanes p Novell ad Calcem Cod Theod tom vi p The praises which St Leo and the Catholics have bestowed on Marcian are diligently transcribed by Baronius as an encouragement for future princes    CHAP XXXV  Invasion of Gaul by AttilaHe is repulsed by Aetius and the VisigothsAttila invades and evacuates ItalyThe Deaths of Attila Aetius and Valentinian the Third  IT was the opinion of Marcian that war should be avoided as long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honourable peace but it was  Attila threatens both empires and prepares to invade Gaul A D  likewise his opinion that peace cannot be honourable or secure if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of Attila who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute The emperor signified to the Barbarians that they must no longer insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute that he was disposed to reward with becoming liberality the faithful friendship of his allies but that if they presumed to violate the public peace they should feel that he possessed troops and arms and resolution to repel their attacks The same language even in the camp of the Huns was used by his ambassador Apollonius whose bold refusal to deliver the presents till he had been admitted to a personal interview displayed a sense of dignity and a contempt of danger which Attila was not prepared to expect from the  degenerate Romans  See Priscus p  He threatened to chastise the rash successor of Theodosius but he hesitated whether he should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or the Western empire While mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople and his ministers saluted the two emperors with the same haughty declaration  "Attila  my  lord and  thy  lord commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception  The Alexandrian or Paschal Chronicle which introduces this haughty message during the lifetime of Theodosius may have anticipated the date but the dull annalist was incapable of inventing the original and genuine style of Attila  "  But as the Barbarian despised or affected to despise the Romans of the East whom he had so often vanquished he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest till he had atchieved a more glorious and important enterprise In the memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces but the particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of Valentinian or to speak more correctly under the administration of Aetius  The second book of the Histoire Critique de l'Etablissement de la Monarchie Françoise tom i p throws great light on the state of Gaul when it was invaded by Attila but the ingenious author the Abbé Dubos too often bewilders himself in system and conjecture    After the death of his rival Boniface Aetius  Character and administration of Aetius  had prudently retired to the tents of the Huns  and he was indebted to their alliance for his safety and his restoration Instead of the suppliant language of a guilty exile he solicited his pardon  A D  at the head of sixty thousand Barbarians and the empress Placidia confessed by a feeble resistance that the condescension which might have been ascribed to clemency was the effect of weakness or fear She delivered herself her son Valentinian and the Western empire into the hands of an insolent subject nor could Placidia protect the soninlaw of Boniface the virtuous and faithful Sebastian  Victor Vitensis de Persecut Vandal l i c p edit Ruinart calls him acer consilio et strenuus in bello but his courage when he became unfortunate was censured as desperate rashness and Sebastian deserved or obtained the epithet of  praeceps  Sidon Apollinar Carmen ix His adventures at Constantinople in Sicily Gaul Spain and Africa are faintly marked in the Chronicles of Marcellinus and Idatius In his distress he was always followed by a numerous train since he could ravage the Hellespont and Propontis and seize the city of Barcelona  from the implacable persecution which urged him from one kingdom to another till he miserably perished in the service of the Vandals The fortunate Aetius who was immediately promoted to the rank of patrician and thrice invested with the honours of the confulship assumed with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry the whole military power of the state and he is sometimes styled by contemporary writers the Duke or General of the Romans of the West His prudence rather than his virtue engaged him to leave the grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple and Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and  luxury of Italy while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and a patriot who supported near twenty years the ruins of the Western empire The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses that Aetius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic  Reipublicae Romanae singulariter natus qui superbiam Suevorum Francorumque barbariem immensis coedibus servire Imperio Romano coegisset Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c p  and the following portrait though it is drawn in the fairest colours must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than of flattery  "His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian and his father Gaudentius who held a distinguished rank in the province of Scythia gradually rose from the station of a military  domestic  to the dignity of master of the cavalry Their son who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards was given as a hostage first to Alaric and afterwards to the Huns and he successively obtained the civil and military honours of the palace for which he was equally qualified by superior merit The graceful figure of Aetius was not above the middle stature but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength beauty and agility and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing a horse drawing the bow and darting the javelin He could patiently endure the want of food or of sleep and his mind and body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts He possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers but injuries and it  was impossible either to corrupt or deceive or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul  This portrait is drawn by Renatus Profuturus Frigeridus a contemporary historian known only by some extracts which are preserved by Gregory of Tours l ii c in tom ii p It was probably the duty or at least the interest of Renatus to magnify the virtues of Aetius but he would have shewn more dexterity if he had not insisted on his patient  forgiving  disposition  "  The Barbarians who had seated themselves in the Western provinces were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valour of the patrician Aetius He soothed their passions consulted their prejudices balanced their interests and checked their ambition A seasonable treaty which he concluded with Genseric protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals the independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and Spain and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi whom he had vanquished in the field to become the useful confederates of the republic  From a principle of interest as well as gratitude  His connection with the Huns and Alani  Aetius assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns While he resided in their tents as a hostage or an exile he had familiarly conversed with Attila himself the nephew of his benefactor and the two famous antagonists appear to have been connected by a personal and military friendship which they afterwards confirmed by mutual gifts frequent embassies and the education of Carpilio the son of Aetius in the camp of Attila By the specious professions of gratitude  and voluntary attachment the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian conqueror who pressed the two empires with his innumerable armies His demands were obeyed or eluded When he claimed the spoils of a vanquished city some vases of gold which had been fraudulently embezzled the civil and military governors of Noricum were immediately dispatched to satisfy his complaints  The embassy consisted of Count Romulus of Promotus president of Noricum and of Romanus the military duke They were accompanied by Tatullus an illustrious citizen of Petovio in the same province and father of Orestes who had married the daughter of Count Romulus See Priscus p Cassiodorius Variar i mentions another embassy which was executed by his father and Carpilio the son of Aetius and as Attila was no more he could safely boast of their manly intrepid behaviour in his presence  and it is evident from their conversation with Maximin and Priscus in the royal village that the valour and prudence of Aetius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy of tribute Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of a salutary peace and a numerous army of Huns and Alani whom he had attached to his person was employed in the defence of Gaul Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the territories of Valens and Orleans  Deserta Valentinae urbis rura Alanis partienda traduntur Prosper Tyronis Chron in Historiens de France tom i p A few lines afterwards Prosper observes that lands in the  ulterior  Gaul were assigned to the Alani Without admitting the correction of Dubos tom i p the reasonable supposition of  two  colonies or garrisons of Alani will confirm his arguments and remove his objections  and their active cavalry secured the important  passages of the Rhone and of the Loire These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the subjects than to the enemies of Rome Their original settlement was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest and the province through which they marched was exposed to all the calamities of an hostile invasion  See Prosper Tyro p Sidonius Panegyr Avit complains in the name of Auvergne his native country  Litorius Scythicos

Another poet Paulinus of Perigord confirms the complaint  Nam socium vix ferre queas qui durior hoste  See Dubos tom i p  Strangers to the emperor or the republic the Alani of Gaul were devoted to the ambition of Aetius and though he might suspect that in a contest with Attila himself they would revolt to the standard of their national king the patrician laboured to restrain rather than to excite their zeal and resentment against the Goths the Burgundians and the Franks  The kingdom established by the Visigoths in  The Visigoths in Gaul under the reign of Theodoric A D  the southern provinces of Gaul had gradually acquired strength and maturity and the conduct of those ambitious Barbarians either in peace or war engaged the perpetual vigilance of Aetius After the death of Wallia the Gothic sceptre devolved to Theodoric the son of the great  Alaric  Theodoric II the son of Theodoric I declares to Avitus his resolution of repairing or expiating the fault which his  grandfather  had committed  Quae  noster  peccavit  avus  quem fuscat id unum  Quod te Roma capit  Sidon Panegyric Avit  This character applicable only to the great Alaric establishes the genealogy of the Gothic kings which has hitherto been unnoticed  and his prosperous reign of more than thirty years over a turbulent people may be allowed to prove that his prudence was supported by uncommon vigour both of mind and body Impatient of his narrow limits Theodoric aspired to the possession of Arles the wealthy seat of government and commerce but the city was saved by the timely approach of Aetius and the Gothic king who had raised the siege with some loss and disgrace was persuaded for an adequate subsidy to divert the martial valour of his subjects in a Spanish war Yet Theodoric still watched and eagerly seized the favourable moment of renewing his hostile attempts The Goths  A D  besieged Narbonne while the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians and the public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union of the enemies of Rome On every side the activity of Aetius and his Scythian cavalry opposed a firm and successful resistance Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle and the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the mountains  of Savoy  The name of  Sapaudia  the origin of  Savoy  is first mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus and two military posts are ascertained by the Notitia within the limits of that province a cohort was stationed at Grenoble in Dauphiné and Ebredunum or Iverdun sheltered a fleet of small vessels which commanded the lake of Neufchâtel See Valesius Notit Galliarum p D'Anville Notice de l'Ancienne Gaul p  The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by the battering engines and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine when count Litorius approaching in silence and directing each horseman to carry behind him two sacks of flour cut his way through the intrenchments of the besiegers The siege was immediately raised and the more decisive victory which is ascribed to the personal conduct of Aetius himself was marked with the blood of eight thousand Goths But in the absence of the patrician who was hastily summoned to Italy by some public or private interest count Litorius succeeded to the command and his presumption soon discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing of cavalry or to direct the operations of an important war At the head of an army of Huns he rashly advanced to the gates of Thoulouse full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent and his situation made desperate The predictions of the Augurs had inspired Litorius with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic capital in triumph and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan allies encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace which  were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of Theodoric The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat His soldiers animated with martial and religious enthusiasm assaulted the camp of Litorius The conflict was obstinate the slaughter was mutual The Roman general after a total defeat which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse not in his own but in a hostile triumph and the misery which he experienced in a long and ignominious captivity excited the compassion of the Barbarians themselves  Salvian has attempted to explain the moral government of the Deity a task which may be readily performed by supposing that the calamities of the wicked are  judgments  and those of the righteous  trials  Such a loss in a country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted could not easily be repaired and the Goths assuming in their turn the sentiments of ambition and revenge would have planted their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone if the presence of Aetius had not restored strength and discipline to the Romans  Capto terrarum damna patebant  Litorio

two armies expected the  signal of a decisive action but the generals who were conscious of each other's force and doubtful of their own superiority prudently sheathed their swords in the field of battle and their reconciliation was permanent and sincere Theodoric king of the Visigoths appears to have deserved the love of his subjects the confidence of his allies and the esteem of mankind His throne was surrounded by six valiant sons who were educated with equal care in the exercises of the Barbarian camp and in those of the Gallic schools from the study of the Roman jurisprudence they acquired the theory at least of law and justice and the harmonious sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their native manners  Theodoric II revered in the person of Avitus the

Avit c  The two daughters of the Gothic king were given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi and of the Vandals who reigned in Spain and Africa but these illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord The queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of an husband inhumanly massacred by her brother The princess of the Vandals was the victim of a jealous tyrant whom she called her father The cruel Genseric suspected that his  son's wife had conspired to poison him the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her nose and ears and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed and mutilated condition This horrid act which must seem incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator but Theodoric was urged by the feelings of a parent and a king to revenge such irreparable injuries The Imperial ministers who always cherished the discord of the Barbarians would have supplied the Goths with arms and ships and treasures for the African war and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to himself if the artful Vandal had not armed in his cause the formidable power of the Huns His rich gifts and pressing solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila and the designs of Aetius and Theodoric were prevented by the invasion of Gaul  Our authorities for the reign of

arms or their ranks and their unavailing valour was fatal only to themselves The loaded waggons which had followed their march afforded a rich booty and the virginbride with her female attendants submitted to the new lovers who were imposed on them by the chance of war This advantage which had been obtained by the skill and activity of Aetius might reflect some disgrace on the military prudence of Clodion but the king of the Franks soon regained his strength and reputation and still maintained the possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme  See a vague account of

of the Necker but the arguments of M de Foncemagne Mem de l'Academie tom viii p seem to prove that the succession of Clodion was disputed by his two sons and that the younger was Meroveus the father of Childeric  was persuaded to implore the protection of Rome he was received at the Imperial court as the ally of Valentinian and the adopted son of the patrician Aetius and dismissed to his native country with splendid gifts and the strongest assurances of friendship and support During his absence his elder brother had solicited with equal ardour the formidable aid of Attila and the king of the Huns embraced an alliance which  facilitated the passage of the Rhine and justified by a specious and honourable pretence the invasion of Gaul  Under the Merovingian race the throne was hereditary but all the sons of the deceased monarch were equally intitled to their share of his treasures and territories See the Dissertations of M de Foncemagne in the sixth and eighth volumes of the Memoires de l'Academie    When Attila declared his resolution of supporting  The adventures of the princess Honoria  the cause of his allies the Vandals and the Franks at the same time and almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry the savage monarch professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess Honoria The sister of Valentinian was educated in the palace of Ravenna and as her marriage might be

sixteenth year of her age than she detested the importunate greatness which must for ever exclude her from the comforts of honourable love in the midst of vain and unsatisfactory pomp Honoria sighed yielded to the impulse of nature and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain Eugenius Her guilt and shame such is the absurd language of imperious man were soon betrayed by the apperances of pregnancy but the disgrace of the royal family was published to the world by the  imprudence of the empress Placidia who dismissed her daughter after a strict and shameful confinement to a remote exile at Constantinople The unhappy princess passed twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of Theodosius and their chosen virgins to whose  crown  Honoria could no longer aspire and whose monastic assiduity of prayer fasting and vigils she reluctantly imitated Her impatience of long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and desperate resolution The name of Attila was familiar and formidable at Constantinople and his frequent embassies entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the Imperial palace In the pursuit of love or rather of revenge the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty and every prejudice and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a Barbarian of whose language she was ignorant whose figure was scarcely human and whose religion and manners she abhorred By the ministry of a faithful eunuch she transmitted to Attila a ring the pledge of her affection and earnestly conjured him to claim her as a lawful spouse to whom he had been secretly betrothed These indecent advances were received however with coldness and disdain and the king of the Huns continued to multiply the number of his wives till his love was awakened by the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice The invasion of Gaul was preceded and justified by a formal demand of the princess Honoria with a just and  equal share of the Imperial patrimony His predecessors the ancient Tanjous had often addressed in the same hostile and peremptory manner the daughters of China and the pretensions of Attila were not less offensive to the majesty of Rome A firm but temperate refusal was communicated to his ambassadors The right of female succession though it might derive a specious argument from the recent examples of Placidia and Pulcheria was strenuously denied and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed to the claims of her Scythian lover  See Priscus p It might be fairly alleged that if females could succeed to the throne Valentinian himself who had married the daughter and heiress of the younger Theodosius would have asserted her right to the eastern empire  On the discovery of her connexion with the king of the Huns the guilty princess had been sent away as an object of horror from Constantinople to Italy her life was spared but the ceremony of her marriage was performed with some obscure and nominal husband before she was immured in a perpetual prison to bewail those crimes and misfortunes which Honoria might have escaped had she not been born the daughter of an emperor  The adventures of Honoria are imperfectly related by Jornandes de Successione Regn c and de Reb Get c p and in the Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus but they cannot be made consistent or probable unless we separate by an interval of time and place her intrigue with Eugenius and her invitation of Attila    A native of Gaul and a contemporary the  Attila invades Gaul and besieges Orleans  learned and eloquent Sidonius

Avit c  The kings and nations of Germany and Scythia from the Volga perhaps to the Danube obeyed the warlike summons of Attila From the royal village in the plains of Hungary his standard moved towards the West and after a march of seven or eight hundred miles he reached the conflux of the Rhine and the Necker where he was joined by the Franks who adhered to his ally the elder of the sons of Clodion A troop of light Barbarians who roamed in quest of plunder might chuse the winter for the convenience of passing the river  on the ice but the innumerable cavalry of the Huns required such plenty of forage and provisions as could be procured only in a milder season the Hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of boats and the hostile myriads were poured with resistless violence into the Belgic provinces  The most authentic and circumstantial account of this war is contained in Jornandes de Reb Geticis c p who has sometimes abridged and sometimes transcribed the larger history of Cassiodorius Jornandes a quotation which it would be superfluous to repeat may be corrected and illustrated by Gregory of Tours l c and the Chronicles of Idatius Isidore and the two Prospers All the ancient testimonies are collected and inserted in the Historians of France but the reader should be cautioned against a supposed extract from the Chronicle of Idatius among the fragments of Fredegarius tom ii p which often contradicts the genuine text of the Gallician bishop  The consternation of Gaul was universal and the various fortunes of its cities have been adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles  The  ancient  legendaries deserve some regard as they are obliged to connect their fables with the real history of their own times See the lives of St Lupus St Anianus the bishops of Metz Ste Genevieve c in the Historians of France tom i p tom iii p  Troyes was saved by the merits of St Lupus St Servatius was removed from the world that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres and the prayers of St Genevieve diverted the march of Attila from the neighbourhood of Paris But as the greatest part of the Gallic cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers they were besieged and stormed by the Huns who practised in the example of  Metz  The scepticism of the count de Buat Hist des Peuples tom vii p cannot be reconciled with any principles of reason or criticism Is not Gregory of Tours precise and positive in his account of the destruction of Metz At the distance of no more than an hundred years could he be ignorant could the people be ignorant of the fate of a city the actual residence of his sovereigns the kings of Austrasia The learned Count who seems to have undertaken the apology of Attila and the Barbarians appeals to the false Idatius  parcens  civitatibus Germaniae et Galliae and forgets that the true Idatius had explicitly affirmed plurimae civitates  effractae  among which he enumerates Metz  their customary maxims of war They involved in a promiscuous massacre the priests who served at the altar and the infants who in the hour of danger had been providently baptized by the bishop the flourishing city was delivered to the flames and a solitary chapel of St Stephen marked the place where it formerly stood From the Rhine and the Moselle Attila advanced into the heart of Gaul crossed the Seine at Auxerre and after a long and laborious march fixed his camp under the walls of Orleans He was desirous of securing his conquests by the possession of an advantageous post which commanded the passage of the Loire and he depended on the secret invitation of Sangiban king of the Alani who had promised to betray the city and to revolt from the service of the empire But this treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed Orleans had been strengthened with recent fortifications and the assaults of the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valour of the soldiers or citizens who defended the place The pastoral diligence of Anianus a bishop of primitive sanctity and consummate  prudence exhausted every art of religious policy to support their courage till the arrival of the expected succours After an obstinate siege the walls were shaken by the battering rams the Huns had already occupied the suburbs and the people who were incapable of bearing arms lay prostrate in prayer Anianus who anxiously counted the days and hours dispatched a trusty messenger to observe from the rampart the face of the distant country He returned twice without any intelligence that could inspire hope or comfort but in his third report he mentioned a small cloud which he had faintly descried at the extremity of the horizon "It is the aid of God" exclaimed the bishop in a tone of pious confidence and the whole multitude repeated after him "It is the aid of God" The remote object on which every eye was fixed became each moment larger and more distinct the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived and a favourable wind blowing aside the dust discovered in deep array the impatient squadrons of Aetius and Theodoric who pressed forwards to the relief of Orleans  The facility with which Attila had penetrated  Alliance of the Romans and Visigoths  into the heart of Gaul may be ascribed to his insidious policy as well as to the terror of his arms His public declarations were skilfully mitigated by his private assurances he alternately soothed and threatened the Romans and the Goths and the courts of Ravenna and Thoulouse mutually suspicious of each other's intentions  beheld with supine indifference the approach of their common enemy Aetius was the sole guardian of the public safety but his wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction which since the death of Placidia infested the Imperial palace the youth of Italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet and the Barbarians who from fear or affection were inclined to the cause of Attila awaited with doubtful and venal faith the event of the war The patrician passed the Alps at the head of some troops whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army  Vix liquerat Alpes  Aetius tenue et rarum sine milite ducens  Robur in auxiliis Geticum male credulus agmen  Incassum propriis praesumens adfore castris  Panegyr Avit c  But on his arrival at Arles or Lyons he was confounded by the intelligence that the Visigoths refusing to embrace the defence of Gaul had determined to expect within their own territories the formidable invader whom they professed to despise The senator Avitus who after the honourable exercise of the praetorian Praefecture had retired to his estate in Auvergne was persuaded to accept the important embassy which he executed with ability and success He represented to Theodoric that an ambitious conqueror who aspired to the dominion of the earth could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance of the powers whom he laboured to oppress The lively eloquence of Avitus inflamed the Gothic warriors by the description of the  injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns whose implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of the Pyrenees He strenuously urged that it was the duty of every Christian to save from sacrilegious violation the churches of God and the relics of the saints that it was the interest of every Barbarian who had acquired a settlement in Gaul to defend the fields and vineyards which were cultivated for his use against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds Theodoric yielded to the evidence of truth adopted the measure at once the most prudent and the most honourable and declared that as the faithful ally of Aetius and the Romans he was ready to expose his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul  The policy of Attila of Aetius and of the Visigoths is imperfectly described in the Panegyric of Avitus and the thirtysixth chapter of Jornandes The poet and the historian were both biassed by personal or national prejudices The former exalts the merit and importance of Avitus orbis Avite salus c The latter is anxious to shew the Goths in the most favourable light Yet their agreement when they are fairly interpreted is a proof of their veracity  The Visigoths who at that time were in the mature vigour of their fame and power obeyed with alacrity the signal of war prepared their arms and horses and assembled under the standard of their aged king who was resolved with his two eldest sons Torismond and Theodoric to command in person his numerous and valiant people The example of the Goths determined several tribes or nations that seemed to fluctuate between the Huns and the Romans The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually collected  the troops of Gaul and Germany who had formerly acknowledged themselves the subjects or soldiers of the republic but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service and the rank of independent allies the Laeti the Armoricans the Breones the Saxons the Burgundians the Sarmatians or Alani the Ripuarians and the Franks who followed Meroveus as their lawful prince Such was the various army which under the conduct of Aetius and Theodoric advanced by rapid marches to relieve Orleans and to give battle to the innumerable host of Attila  The review of the army of Aetius is made by Jornandes c p edit Grot tom ii p of the Historians of France with the notes of the Benedictine Editor The  Laeti  were a promiscuous race of Barbarians born or naturalized in Gaul and the Riparii or  Ripuarii  derived their name from their posts on the three rivers the Rhine the Meuse and the Moselle the  Armoricans  possessed the independent cities between the Seine and the Loire A colony of  Saxons  had been planted in the diocese of Bayeux the  Burgundians  were settled in Savoy and the  Breones  were a warlike tribe of Rhaetians to the east of the lake of Constance    On their approach the king of the Huns immediately  Attila retires to the plains of Champagne  raised the siege and sounded a retreat to recal the foremost of his troops from the pillage of a city which they had already entered  Aurelianensis urbis obsidio oppugnatio irruptio nec direptio l v Sidon Apollin l viii epist p The preservation of Orleans might be easily turned into a miracle obtained and foretold by the holy bishop  The valour of Attila was always guided by his prudence and as he foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul he repassed the Seine and expected the enemy in the plains of Châlons whose smooth and level  surface was adapted to the operations of his Scythian cavalry But in this tumultuary retreat the vanguard of the Romans and their allies continually pressed and sometimes engaged the troops whom Attila had posted in the rear the hostile columns in the darkness of the night and the perplexity of the roads might encounter each other without design and the bloody conflict of the Franks and Gepidae in which fifteen thousand  The common editions read XCM but there is some authority of manuscripts and almost any authority is sufficient for the more

the territory of Rheims from whence it is distant only twentyseven miles See Vales Notit Gall p D'Anville Notice de l'Ancienne Gaule p  spread themselves round Châlons and extend according to the vague measurement of Jornandes to the length of one hundred and fifty and the breadth of one hundred miles over the whole province which is intitled to the appellation of a  champaign  country  The name of Campania or Champagne is frequently mentioned by Gregory of Tours and that great province of which Rheims was the capital obeyed the command of a duke Vales Notit p  This spacious plain was distinguished however by some inequalities of ground and the importance of an height which commanded the camp of Attila was understood and disputed by the two generals The young and valiant Torismond first occupied the summit the Goths rushed with irresistible weight on the Huns who  laboured to ascend from the opposite side and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory The anxiety of Attila prompted him to consult his priests and haruspices It was reported that after scrutinizing the entrails of victims and scraping their bones they revealed in mysterious language his own defeat with the death of his principal adversary and that the Barbarian by accepting the equivalent expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior merit of Aetius But the unusual despondency which seemed to prevail among the Huns engaged Attila to use the expedient so familiar to the generals of antiquity of animating his troops by a military oration and his language was that of a king who had often fought and conquered at their head  I am sensible that these military orations are usually composed by the historian yet the old Ostrogoths who had served under Attila might repeat his discourse to Cassiodorius the ideas and even the expressions have an original Scythian cast and I doubt whether an Italian of the sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis  gaudia  He pressed them to consider their past glory their actual danger and their future hopes The same fortune which opened the deserts and morasses of Scythia to their unarmed valour which had laid so many warlike nations prostrate at their feet had reserved the  joys  of this memorable field for the consummation of their victories The cautious steps of their enemies their strict alliance and their advantageous posts he artfully represented as the effects not of prudence but  of fear The Visigoths alone were the strength and nerves of the opposite army and the Huns might securely trample on the degenerate Romans whose close and compact order betrayed their apprehensions and who were equally incapable of supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle The doctrine of predestination so favourable to martial virtue was carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns who assured his subjects that the warriors protected by Heaven were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy but that the unerring Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious peace  "I myself" continued Attila "will throw the first javelin and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his sovereign is devoted to inevitable death"  The spirit of the Barbarians was rekindled by the presence the voice and the example of their intrepid leader and Attila yielding to their impatience immediately formed his order of battle At the head of his brave and faithful Huns he occupied in person the centre of the line The nations subject to his empire the Rugians the Heruli the Thuringians the Franks the Burgundians were extended on either hand over the ample space of the Catalaunian fields the right wing was commanded by Ardaric king of the Gepidae and the three valiant brothers who reigned over the Ostrogoths were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes of the Visigoths The disposition of the allies was regulated by a different principle Sangiban the faithless king of the Alani  was placed in the centre where his motions might be strictly watched and his treachery might be instantly punished Aetius assumed the command of the left and Theodoric of the right wing while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights which appear to have stretched on the flank and perhaps the rear of the Scythian army The nations from the Volga to the Atlantic were assembled on the plain of Châlons but many of these nations had been divided by faction or conquest or emigration and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns which threatened each other presented the image of a civil war  The discipline and tactics of the Greeks and Romans form an interesting part of their national  Battle of Châlons  manners The attentive study of the military operations of Xenophon or Caesar or Frederic when they are described by the same genius which conceived and executed them may tend to improve if such improvement can be wished the art of destroying the human species But the battle of Châlons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the object since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of Barbarians and has been related by partial writers whose civil or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of military affairs Cassiodorius however had familiarly conversed with many Gothic warriors who served in that memorable engagement  "a conflict" as they informed him "fierce various obstinate and bloody such as could not be paralleled either in the present  or in past ages"  The number of the slain amounted to one hundred and sixtytwo thousand or according to another account three hundred thousand persons  The expressions of Jornandes or rather of Cassiodorius are extremely strong Bellum atrox multiplex immane pertinax cui simili nulla usquam narrat antiquitas ubi talia gesta referuntur ut nihil esset quod in vitâ suâ conspicere potuisset egregius qui hujus miraculi privaretur aspectû Dubos Hist Critique tom i p attempts to reconcile the of Jornandes with the of Idatius and Isidore by supposing that the larger number included the total destruction of the war the effects of disease the slaughter of the unarmed people c  and these incredible exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to justify the historian's remark that whole generations may be swept away by the madness of kings in the space of a single hour After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior dexterity the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were furiously mingled in closer combat The Huns who fought under the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful centre of the allies separated their wings from each other and wheeling with a rapid effort to the left directed their whole force against the Visigoths As Theodoric rode along the ranks to animate his troops he received a mortal stroke from the javelin of Andages a noble Ostrogoth and immediately fell from his horse The wounded king was oppressed in the general disorder and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry and this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the Haruspices Attila already exulted  in the confidence of victory when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills and verified the remainder of the prediction The Visigoths who had been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the Alani gradually restored their order of battle and the Huns were undoubtedly vanquished since Attila was compelled to retreat He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private soldier but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed forwards beyond the rest of the line their attack was faintly supported their flanks were unguarded and the conquerors of Scythia and Germany were saved by the approach of the night from a total defeat They retired within the circle of waggons that fortified their camp and the dismounted squadrons prepared themselves for a defence to which neither their arms nor their temper were adapted The event was doubtful but Attila had secured a last and honourable resource The saddles and rich furniture of the cavalry were collected by his order into a funeral pile and the magnanimous Barbarian had resolved if his intrenchments should be forced to rush headlong into the flames and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired by the death or captivity of Attila  The count de Buat Hist des Peuples c tom vii p still depending on the  false  and again rejecting the  true  Idatius has divided the defeat of Attila into two great battles the former near Orleans the latter in Champagne in the one Theodoric was slain in the other he was revenged    But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and anxiety The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to urge the pursuit  Retreat of Attila  till he unexpectedly found himself with a few followers in the midst of the Scythian waggons In the confusion of a nocturnal combat he was thrown from his horse and the Gothic prince must have perished like his father if his youthful strength and the intrepid zeal of his companions had not rescued him from this dangerous situation In the same manner but on the left of the line Aetius himself separated from his allies ignorant of their victory and anxious for their fate encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered over the plains of Châlons and at length reached the camp of the Goths which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of shields till the dawn of day The Imperial general was soon satisfied of the defeat of Attila who still remained inactive within his intrenchments and when he contemplated the bloody scene he observed with secret satisfaction that the loss had principally fallen on the Barbarians The body of Theodoric pierced with honourable wounds was discovered under a heap of the slain his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy The Goths clashing their arms elevated on a buckler his eldest son Torismond to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their success and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge  as a sacred portion of his paternal inheritance Yet the Goths themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of their formidable antagonist and their historian has compared Attila to a lion encompassed in his den and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury The kings and nations who might have deserted his standard in the hour of distress were made sensible that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and inevitable danger All his instruments of martial music incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance and the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the intrenchments It was determined in a general council of war to besiege the king of the Huns in his camp to intercept his provisions and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful treaty or an unequal combat But the impatience of the Barbarians soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures and the mature policy of Aetius was apprehensive that after the extirpation of the Huns the republic would be oppressed by the pride and power of the Gothic nation The patrician exerted the superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty represented with seeming affection and real truth the dangers of absence and delay and persuaded Torismond to disappoint by his speedy return the ambitious designs of his brothers who might occupy the throne and treasures of Thoulouse  Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c p The policy of Aetius and the behaviour of Torismond are extremely natural and the patrician according to Gregory of Tours l ii c p dismissed the prince of the Franks by suggesting to him a similar apprehension The false Idatius ridiculously pretends that Aetius paid a clandestine nocturnal visit to the kings of the Huns and of the Visigoths from each of whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold as the price of an undisturbed retreat    After the departure of the Goths and the separation of the allied army Attila was surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of Châlons the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him several days within the circle of his waggons and his retreat beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was attchieved in the name of the Western empire Meroveus and his Franks observing a prudent distance and magnifying the opinion of their strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night continued to follow the rear of the Huns till they reached the confines of Thuringia The Thuringians served in the army of Attila they traversed both in their march and in their return the territories of the Franks and it was perhaps in this war that they exercised the cruelties which about fourscore years afterwards were revenged by the son of Clovis They massacred their hostages as well as their captives two hundred young maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage their bodies were torn asunder by wild horses or their bones were crushed under the weight of rolling waggons and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as a prey to dogs and vultures  Such were those savage ancestors whose imaginary virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized ages  These cruelties which are passionately deplored by Theodoric the son of Clovis Gregory of Tours l iii c p suit the time and circumstances of the invasion of Artila His residence in Thuringia was long attested by popular tradition and he is supposed to have assembled a  couroultai  or diet in the territory of Eisenach See Mascou ix who settles with nice accuracy the extent of ancient Thuringia and derives its name from the Gothic tribe of the Thervingi    Neither the spirit nor the forces nor the  Invasion of Italy by Attila A D  reputation of Attila were impaired by the failure of the Gallic expedition In the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess Honoria and her patrimonial treasures The demand was again rejected or eluded and the indignant lover immediately took the field passed the Alps invaded Italy and besieged Aquileia with an innumerable host of Barbarians Those Barbarians were unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege which even among the ancients required some knowledge or at least some practice of the mechanic arts But the labour of many thousand provincials and captives whose lives were sacrificed without pity might execute the most painful and dangerous work The skill of the Roman artists might be corrupted to the destruction of their country The walls of Aquileia were assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams moveable turrets and engines that threw stones darts and fire  Machinis constructis omnibusque tormentorum generibus adhibitis Jornandes c p In the thirteenth century the Moguls battered the cities of China with large engines constructed by the Mahometans or Christians in their service which threw stones from to pounds weight In the defence of their country the Chinese used gunpowder and even bombs above an hundred years before they were known in Europe yet even those celestial or infernal arms were insufficient to protect a pusillanimous nation See Gaubil Hist des Mongous p c  and  the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope fear emulation and interest to subvert the only barrier which delayed the conquest of Italy Aquileia was at that period one of the richest the most populous and the strongest of the maritime cities of the Hadriatic coast The Gothic auxiliaries who appear to have served under their native princes Alaric and Antala communicated their intrepid spirit and the citizens still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which their ancestors had opposed to a fierce inexorable Barbarian who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple Three months were consumed without effect in the siege of Aquileia till the want of provisions and the clamours of his army compelled Attila to relinquish the enterprise and reluctantly to issue his orders that the troops should strike their tents the next morning and begin their retreat But as he rode round the walls pensive angry and disappointed he observed a stork preparing to leave her nest in one of the towers and to fly with her infant family towards the country He seized with the ready penetration of a statesman this trifling incident which chance had offered to superstition and exclaimed in a  loud and cheerful tone that such a domestic bird so constantly attached to human society would never have abandoned her ancient seats unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude  The same story is told by Jornandes and by Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p nor is it easy to decide which is the original But the Greek historian is guilty of an inexcuseable mistake in placing the siege of Aquileia  after  the death of Aetius  The favourable omen inspired an assurance of victory the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigour a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had taken her flight the Huns mounted to the assault with irresistible fury and the succeeding generation could scarcely discover the ruins of Aquileia  Jornandes about an hundred years afterwards affirms that Aquileia was so completely ruined ita ut vix ejus vestigia ut appareant reliquerint See Jornandes de Reb Geticis c p Paul Diacon l ii c p Liutprand Hist l iii c The name of Aquileia was sometimes applied to Forum Julii Cividad del Friuli the more recent capital of the Venetian province  After this dreadful chastisement Attila pursued his march and as he passed the cities of Altinum Concordia and Padua were reduced into heaps of stones and ashes The inland towns Vicenza Verona and Bergamo were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns Milan and Pavia submitted without resistance to the loss of their wealth and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from the flames the public as well as private buildings and spared the lives of the captive multitude The popular traditions of Comum Turin or Modena may justly be suspected yet  they concur with more authentic evidence to prove that Attila spread his ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy which are divided by the Po and bounded by the Alps and Apennine  In describing this war of Attila a war so famous but so imperfectly known I have taken for my guides two learned Italians who considered the subject with some peculiar advantages Sigonius de Imperio Occidentali l xiii in his works tom i p and Muratori Aunali d'Italia tom iv p vo edition  When he took possession of the royal palace of Milan he was surprised and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the Caesars seated on their throne and the princes of Scythia prostrate at their feet The revenge which Attila inflicted on this monument of Roman vanity was harmless and ingenious He commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes and the emperors were delineated on the same canvass approaching in a suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before the throne of the Scythian monarch  This article may be found under two different articles  and  of the miscellaneous compilation of Suidas  The spectators must have confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration and were perhaps tempted to apply on this singular occasion the wellknown fable of the dispute between the lion and the man  Leo respondit humanâ hoc pictum manû  Videres hominem dejectum si pingere  Leones scirent Appendix ad Phaedrum Fab xxv  The lion in Phaedrus very foolishly appeals from pictures to the amphitheatre and I am glad to observe that the native taste of La Fontaine l iii fable x has omitted this most lame and impotent conclusion    It is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila that the grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod Yet the savage destroyer  Foundation of the republic of Venice  undesignedly laid the

capable of enlarged views and minute disquisitions  was formerly diffused over a large and fertile province of Italy from the confines of Pannonia to the river Addua and from the Po to the Rhaetian and Julian Alps Before the irruption of the Barbarians fifty Venetian cities flourished in peace and prosperity Aquileia was placed in the most conspicuous station but the ancient dignity of Padua was supported by agriculture and manufactures and the property of five hundred citizens who were entitled to the equestrian rank must have amounted at the strictest computation to one million seven hundred thousand pounds Many families of Aquileia Padua and the adjacent towns who fled from the sword of the Huns found a safe though obscure refuge in the neighbouring islands  This emigration is not attested by any contemporary evidence but the fact is proved by the event and the circumstances might be preserved by tradition The citizens of Aquileia retired to the Isle of Gradus those of Padua to Rivus Altus or Rialto where the city of Venice was afterwards built c  At the extremity of the Gulf  where the Hadriatic feebly imitates the tides of the ocean near an hundred small islands are separated by shallow water from the continent and protected from the waves by several long slips of land which admit the entrance of vessels through some secret and narrow channels  The topography and antiquities of the Venetian islands from Gradus to Clodia or Chioggia are accurately stated in the Dissertatio Chorographica de Italiâ Medii Aevi p  Till the middle of the fifth century these remote and sequestered spots remained without cultivation with few inhabitants and almost without a name But the manners of the Venetian fugitives their arts and their government were gradually formed by their new situation and one of the epistles of Cassiodorius  Cassiodor Variar l xii epist Maffei Verona Illustrata part i p has translated and explained this curious letter in the spirit of a learned antiquarian and a faithful subject who considered Venice as the only legitimate offspring of the Roman republic He fixes the date of the epistle and consequently the praefecture of Cassiodorius A D and the marquis's authority has the more weight as he had prepared an edition of his works and actually published a Dissertation on the true orthography of his name See Osservazioni Letteraire tom ii p  which describes their condition about seventy years afterwards may be considered as the primitive monument of the republic The minister of Theodoric compares them in his quaint declamatory style to waterfowl who had fixed their nests on the bosom of the waves and though he allows that the Venetian provinces had formerly contained many noble families he insinuates that they were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble poverty Fish was the common and almost the universal  food of every rank their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt which they extracted from the sea and the exchange of that commodity so essential to human life was substituted in the neighbouring markets to the currency of gold and silver A people whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or water soon became alike familiar with the two elements and the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity The islanders who from Grado to Chiozza were intimately connected with each other penetrated into the heart of Italy by the secure though laborious navigation of the rivers and inland canals Their vessels which were continually increasing in size and number visited all the harbours of the Gulf and the marriage which Venice annually celebrates with the Hadriatic was contracted in her early infancy The epistle of Cassiodorius the Praetorian praefect is addressed to the maritime tribunes and he exhorts them in a mild tone of authority to animate the zeal of their countrymen for the public service which required their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the province of Istria to the royal city of Ravenna The ambiguous office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition that in the twelve principal islands twelve tribunes or judges were created by an annual and popular election The existence of the Venetian republic under the Gothic kingdom of Italy is attested by the same authentic record which annihilates their lofty  claim of original and perpetual independence  See in the second volume of Amelot de la Houssaie Histoire du Gouvernement de Venise a translation of the famous  Squittinio  This book which has been exalted far above its merits is stained in every line with the disingenuous malevolence of party but the principal evidence genuine and apocryphal is brought together and the reader will easily chuse the fair medium    The Italians who had long since renounced  Attila gives peace to the Romans  the exercise of arms were surprised after forty years peace by the approach of a formidable Barbarian whom they abhorred as the enemy of their religion as well as of their republic Amidst the general consternation Aetius alone was incapable of fear but it was impossible that he should atchieve alone and unassisted any military exploits worthy of his former renown The Barbarians who had defended Gaul refused to march to the relief of Italy and the succours promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and doubtful Since Aetius at the head of his domestic troops still maintained the field and harassed or retarded the march of Attila he never shewed himself more truly great than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people  Sirmond Not ad Sidon Apollin p has published a curious passage from the Chronicle of Prosper Attila redintegratis viribus quas in Gallia amiserat Italiam ingredi per Pannonias intendit nihil duce nostro Aetio secundum prioris belli opera prospiciente c He reproaches Aetius with neglecting to guard the Alps and with a design to abandon Italy but this rash censure may at least be counterbalanced by the favourable testimonies of Idatius and Isidore  If the mind of Valentinian had been susceptible of any generous sentiments he would have chosen such a general for his example and his guide But the timid grandson of  Theodosius instead of sharing the dangers escaped from the sound of war and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome from an impregnable fortress to an open capital betrayed his secret intention of abandoning Italy as soon as the danger should approach his Imperial person This shameful abdication was suspended however by the spirit of doubt and delay which commonly adheres to pusillanimous counsels and sometimes corrects their pernicious tendency The Western emperor with the senate and people of Rome embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating by a solemn and suppliant embassy the wrath of Attila This important commission was accepted by Avienus who from his birth and riches his consular dignity the numerous train of his clients and his personal abilities held the first rank in the Roman senate The specious and artful character of Avienus  See the original portraits of Avienus and his rival Basilius delineated and contrasted in the epistles i p of Sidonius He had studied the characters of the two chiefs of the senate but he attached himself to Basilius as the more solid and disinterested friend  was admirably qualified to conduct a negociation either of public or private interest his colleague Trigetius had exercised the Praetorian praefecture of Italy and Leo bishop of Rome consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock The genius of Leo  The character and principles of Leo may be traced in one hundred and fortyone original epistles which illustrate the ecclesiastical history of his long and busy pontificate from A D to See Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom iii part ii p  was exercised and displayed  in the public misfortunes and he has deserved the appellation of  Great  by the successful zeal with which he laboured to establish his opinions and his authority under the venerable names of orthodox faith and ecclesiastical discipline The Roman ambassadors were introduced to the tent of Attila as he lay encamped at the place where the slowwinding Mincius is lost in the foaming waves of the lake Benacus  tardis ingens ubi fiexibus errat  Mincius  et tenerâ praetexit arundine ripas  Anne lacus tantos te Lari maxime teque  Fluctibus et fremitu assurgens  Benace  marino  and trampled with his Scythian cavalry the farms of Catullus and Virgil  The Marquis Maffei Verona Illustra part i p part ii p ii has illustrated with taste and learning this interesting topography He places the interview of Attila and St Leo near Ariolica or Ardelica now Peschiera at the conflux of the lake and river ascertains the villa of Catullus in the delightful peninsula of Sarmio and discovers the Andes of Virgil in the village of Bandes precisely situate quâ se subducere colles incipiunt where the Veronese hills imperceptibly slope down into the plain of Mantua  The Barbarian monarch listened with favourable and even respectful attention and the deliverance of Italy was purchased by the immense ransom or dowry of the princess Honoria The state of his army might facilitate the treaty and hasten his retreat Their martial spirit was relaxed by the wealth and indolence of a warm climate The shepherds of the North whose ordinary food consisted of milk and raw flesh indulged themselves too freely in the use of bread of wine and of meat prepared and seasoned by the arts of cookery and the progress of disease  revenged in some measure the injuries of the Italians  Si statim infesto agmine urbem petiissent grande discrimen esset sed in Venetiâ quo fere tractu Italia mollissima est ipsâ soli coelique clementiâ robur elanguit Adhoc panis usû carnisque coctae et dulcedine vini mitigatos c This passage of Florus iii is still more applicable to the Huns than to the Cimbri and it may serve as a commentary on the  celestial  plague with which Idatius and Isidore have afflicted the troops of Attila  When Attila declared his resolution of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome he was admonished by his friends as well as by his enemies that Alaric had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city His mind superior to real danger was assaulted by imaginary terrors nor could he escape the influence of superstition which had so often been subservient to his designs  The historian Priscus had positively mentioned the effect which this example produced on the mind of Attila Jornandes c p  The pressing eloquence of Leo his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes excited the veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians The apparition of the two apostles St Peter and St Paul who menaced the Barbarian with instant death if he rejected the prayer of their successor is one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition The safety of Rome might deserve the interposition of celestial beings and some indulgence is due to a fable which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael and the chissel of Algardi  The picture of Raphael is in the Vatican the basso or perhaps the alto relievo of Algardi on one of the altars of St Peter's see Dubos Reflexions sur la Poesie et sur la Peinture tom i p Baronius Annal Eccles A D No bravely sustains the truth of the apparition which is rejected however by the most learned and pious Catholics    Before the king of the Huns evacuated Italy he threatened to return more dreadful and more implacable if his bride the princess Honoria  The death of Attila A D  were not delivered to his ambassadors within the term stipulated by the treaty Yet in the mean while Attila relieved his tender anxiety by adding a beautiful maid whose name was Ildico to the list of his innumerable wives  Attila ut Priscus historicus refert extinctionis suae tempore puellam Ildico nomine decoram valde sibi matrimonium post innumerabiles uxores socians Jornandes c p He afterwards adds c p Filii Attilae quorum per licentiam libidinis poene populus fuit Polygamy has been established among the Tartars of every age The rank of plebeian wives is regulated only by their personal charms and the faded matron prepares without a murmur the bed which is destined for her blooming rival But in royal families the daughters of Khans communicate to their sons a prior right of inheritance See Genealogical History p  Their marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity at his wooden palace beyond the Danube and the monarch oppressed with wine and sleep retired at a late hour from the banquet to the nuptial bed His attendants continued to respect his pleasures or his repose the greatest part of the ensuing day till the unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions and after attempting to awaken Attila by loud and repeated cries they at length broke into the royal apartment They found the trembling bride sitting by the bedside hiding her face with her veil and lamenting her own danger as well as the death of the king who had expired during  the night  The report of her  guilt  reached Constantinople where it obtained a very different name and Marcellinus observes that the tyrant of Europe was slain in the night by the hand and the knife of a woman Corneille who has adapted the genuine account to his tragedy describes the irruption of blood in forty bombast lines and Attila exclaims with ridiculous fury  S'il ne veut s'arreter  his blood  Ditil on me payera ce qui m'en va couter  An artery had suddenly burst and as Attila lay in a supine posture he was suffocated by a torrent of blood which instead of finding a passage through the nostrils regurgitated into the lungs and stomach His body was solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain under a silken pavilion and the chosen squadrons of the Huns wheeling round in measured evolutions chaunted a funeral song to the memory of a hero glorious in his life invincible in his death the father of his people the scourge of his enemies and the terror of the world According to their national custom the Barbarians cut off a part of their hair gashed their faces with unseemly wounds and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved not with the tears of women but with the blood of warriors The remains of Attila were inclosed within three coffins of gold of silver and of iron and privately buried in the night the spoils of nations were thrown into his grave the captives who had opened the ground were inhumanly massacred and the same Huns who had indulged such excessive grief feasted with dissolute and intemperate mirth about the recent sepulchre of their king It was reported at Constantinople that on  the fortunate night in which he expired Marcian beheld in a dream the bow of Attila broken asunder and the report may be allowed to prove how seldom the image of that formidable Barbarian was absent from the mind of a Roman emperor  The curious circumstances of the death and funeral of Attila are related by Jornandes c p and were probably transcribed from Priscus    The revolution which subverted the empire of  Destruction of his empire  the Huns established the fame of Attila whose genius alone had sustained the huge and disjointed fabric After his death the boldest chieftains aspired to the rank of kings the most powerful kings refused to acknowledge a superior and the numerous sons whom so many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch divided and disputed like a private inheritance the sovereign command of the nations of Germany and Scythia The bold Ardaric felt and represented the disgrace of this servile partition and his subjects the warlike Gepidae with the Ostrogoths under the conduct of three valiant brothers encouraged their allies to vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty In a bloody and decisive conflict on the banks of the river Netad in Pannonia the lance of the Gepidae the sword of the Goths the arrows of the Huns the Suevic infantry the light arms of the Heruli and the heavy weapons of the Alani encountered or supported each other and the victory of Ardaric was accompanied with the slaughter of thirty  thousand of his enemies Ellac the eldest son of Attila lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of Netad his early valour had raised him to the throne of the Acatzires a Scythian people whom he subdued and his father who loved the superior merit would have envied the death of Ellac  See Jornandes de Robus Geticis c p His distinction of the national arms is curious and important Nam ibi admirandum reor fuisse spectaculum ubi cernere crat cunctis pugnantem Gothum ense furentem Gepidam in vulnere suorum cuncta tela frangentem Suevum pede Hunnum sagittâ praesumere Alanum gravi Herulum levi armaturâ aciem instruere I am not precisely informed of the situation of the river Netad  His brother Dengisich with an army of Huns still formidable in their flight and ruin maintained his ground above fifteen years on the banks of the Danube The palace of Attila with the old country of Dacia from the Carpathian hills to the Euxine became the seat of a new power which was erected by Ardaric king of the Gepidae The Pannonian conquests from Vienna to Sirmium were occupied by the Ostrogoths and the settlements of the tribes who had so bravely asserted their native freedom were irregularly distributed according to the measure of their respective strength Surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of his father's slaves the kingdom of Dengisich was confined to the circle of his waggons his desperate courage urged him to invade the Eastern empire he fell in battle and his head ignominiously exposed in the Hippodrome exhibited a grateful spectacle to the people of Constantinople Attila had fondly or superstitiously believed  that Irnac the youngest of his sons was destined to perpetuate the glories of his race The character of that prince who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns and Irnac with his subject hords retired into the heart of the Lesser Scythia They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new Barbarians who followed the same road which their own ancestors had formerly discovered The  Geougen  or Avares whose residence is assigned by the Greek writers to the shores of the ocean impelled the adjacent tribes till at length the Igours of the North issuing from the cold Siberian regions which produce the most valuable furs spread themselves over the desert as far as the Boristhenes and Caspian gates and finally extinguished the empire of the Huns  Two modern historians have thrown much new light on the ruin and division of the empire of Attila M de Buat by his laborious and minute diligence tom viii p and M de Guignes by his extraordinary knowledge of the Chinese language and writers See Hist des Huns tom ii p    Such an event might contribute to the safety  Valentinian murders the patrician Aetius A D  of the Eastern empire under the reign of a prince who conciliated the friendship without forfeiting the esteem of the Barbarians But the emperor of the West the feeble and dissolute Valentinian who had reached his thirtyfifth year without attaining the age of reason or courage abused this apparent security to undermine the foundations of his own throne by the murder of the patrician Aetius From the instinct  of a base and jealous mind he hated the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the barbarians and the support of the republic and his new favourite the eunuch Heraclius awakened the emperor from the supine lethargy which might be disguised during the life of Placidia  Placidia died at Rome November A D She was buried at Ravenna where her sepulchre and even her corpse seated in a chair of cypress wood were preserved for ages The empress received many compliments from the orthodox clergy and St Peter Chrysologus assured her that her zeal for the Trinity had been recompensed by an august trinity of children See Tillemont Hist des Emp tom vi p  by the excuse of filial piety The fame of Aetius his wealth and dignity the numerous and martial train of Barbarian followers his powerful dependents who filled the civil offices of the state and the hopes of his son Gaudentius who was already contracted to Eudoxia the emperor's daughter had raised him above the rank of a subject The ambitious designs of which he was secretly accused excited the fears as well as the resentment of Valentinian Aetius himself supported by the consciousness of his merit his services and perhaps his innocence seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behaviour The patrician offended his sovereign by an hostile declaration he aggravated the offence by compelling him to ratify with a solemn oath a treaty of reconciliation and alliance he proclaimed his suspicions he neglected his safety and from a vain confidence that the enemy whom he despised was incapable  even of a manly crime he rashly ventured his person in the palace of Rome Whilst he urged perhaps with intemperate vehemence the marriage of his son Valentinian drawing his sword the first sword he had ever drawn plunged it in the breast of a general who had saved his empire his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master and Aetius pierced with an hundred wounds fell dead in the royal presence Boethius the Praetorian praefect was killed at the same moment and before the event could be divulged the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace and separately murdered The horrid deed palliated by the specious names of justice and necessity was immediately communicated by the emperor to his soldiers his subjects and his allies The nations who were strangers or enemies to Aetius generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero the Barbarians who had been attached to his service dissembled their grief and resentment and the public contempt which had been so long entertained for Valentinian was at once converted into deep and universal abhorrence Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of a palace yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a Roman whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit  "I am ignorant Sir of your motives or provocations I only know that you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his left  Actium Placidus mactavit semivir amens is the expression of Sidonius Panegyr Avit The poet knew the world and was not inclined to flatter a minister who had injured or disgraced Avitus and Majorian the successive heroes of his song  "  The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent visits of Valentinian who was consequently more despised at Rome than in  and ravishes the wife of Maximus  any other part of his dominions A republican spirit was insensibly revived in the senate as their authority and even their supplies became necessary for the support of his feeble government The stately demeanour of an hereditary monarch offended their pride and the pleasures of Valentinian were injurious to the peace and honour of noble families The birth of the empress Eudoxia was equal to his own and her charms and tender affection deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband dissipated in vague and unlawful amours Petronius Maximus a wealthy senator of the Anician family who had been twice consul was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife her obstinate resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian and he resolved to accomplish them either by stratagem or force Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court the emperor who by chance or contrivance had gained from Maximus a considerable sum uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife with an order in her husband's name that she should immediately attend the empress Eudoxia The unsuspecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in her litter to the Imperial palace the emissaries of her impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent  bedchamber and Valentinian violated without remorse the laws of hospitality Her tears when she returned home her deep affliction and her bitter reproaches against her husband whom she considered as the accomplice of his own shame excited Maximus to a just revenge the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition and he might reasonably aspire by the free suffrage of the Roman senate to the throne of a detested and despicable rival Valentinian who supposed that every human breast was devoid like his own of friendship and gratitude had imprudently admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of Aetius Two of these of Barbarian race were persuaded to execute a sacred and honourable duty by punishing with death the assassin of their patron and their intrepid courage did not long expect a favourable moment Whilst Valentinian amused himself in the field of Mars with the spectacle of some military sports they suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons dispatched the guilty Heraclius and stabbed the emperor to the heart without the  Death of Valentinian

Symptoms of decay and ruin  was the opinion of the Roman augurs that the  twelve vultures  which Romulus had seen represented the  twelve centuries  assigned for the fatal period of his city  This interpretation of Vettius a celebrated augur was quoted by Varro in the xviiith book of his Antiquities Censorinus de Die Natali c p edit Havercamp  This prophecy disregarded perhaps in the season of health and prosperity inspired the people with gloomy apprehensions when the twelfth century clouded with disgrace and misfortune was almost elapsed  According to Varro the twelfth century would expire A D but the uncertainty of the true aera of Rome might allow some latitude of anticipation or delay The poets of the age Claudian de Bell Getico and Sidonius in Panegyr Avit may be admitted as fair witnesses of the popular opinion  Jam reputant annos interceptoque volatû  Vulturis incidunt properatis saecula metis  Jam prope fata tui bissenas Vulturis alas  Implebant scis namque tuos scis

verified in the downfall of the Western empire But its fall was announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures the Roman government appeared every day less formidable to its enemies more

corruption of the Roman government His book was published after the loss of Africa A D and before Attila's war A D  The taxes were multiplied with the public distress oeconomy was neglected in proportion as it became necessary and the injustice of the rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people whom they defrauded of the  indulgencies  that might sometimes have alleviated their misery The severe inquisition which confiscated their goods and tortured their persons compelled the subjects of Valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the Barbarians to fly to the woods and mountains or to embrace the vile and abject condition of mercenary servants They abjured and abhorred the name of Roman citizens which had formerly excited the ambition of mankind The Armorican provinces of Gaul and the greatest part of Spain were thrown into a state of disorderly independence by the confederations of the Bagaudae and the Imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws and ineffectual arms the rebels whom they had made  The Bagaudae of Spain who fought pitched battles with the Roman troops are repeatedly mentioned in the Chronicle of Idatius Salvian has described their distress and rebellion in very forcible language Itaque nomen civium Romanorum nunc ultro repudiatur ac fugitur nec vile tamen sed etiam abominabile poene habetur Et hinc

the glory and greatness of Rome her internal prosperity was irretrievably  Naval power of the Vandals A D  destroyed by the separation of Africa The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates of the senators and intercepted the regular subsidies which relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the plebeians The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack and the province so long cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects was armed against them by an ambitious Barbarian The Vandals and Alani who followed the successful standard of Genseric had acquired a rich and fertile territory which stretched along the coast above ninety days journey from Tangier to Tripoli but their narrow limits were pressed and confined on either side by the sandy desert and the Mediterranean The discovery and conquest of the Black nations that might dwell beneath the torrid zone could not  tempt the rational ambition of Genseric but he cast his eyes towards the sea he resolved to create a naval power and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance The woods of mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of timber his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and shipbuilding he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country accessible to their arms the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder and after an interval of six centuries the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed the empire of the Mediterranean The success of the Vandals the conquest of Sicily the sack of Palermo and the frequent descents on the coast of Lucania awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian and the sister of Theodosius Alliances were formed and armaments expensive and ineffectual were prepared for the destruction of the common enemy who reserved his courage to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays ambiguous promises and apparent concessions and the interposition of his formidable confederate the king of the Huns recalled the emperors from the conquest of Africa to the care of their domestic safety The revolutions of the palace which left the Western empire without a defender and without a lawful prince dispelled the apprehensions and stimulated the avarice  of Genseric He immediately equipped a numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors and cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber about three months after the death of Valentinian and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne  The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus  Sidonius Apollinaris composed the thirteenth epistle of the second book to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus who entertained a singular though generous enthusiasm for the deceased emperor This epistle with some indulgence may claim the praise of an elegant composition and it throws much light on the character of Maximus    The character and reign of the emperor Maximus A D March  was often alleged as a rare example of human felicity His birth was noble and illustrious since he descended from the Anician family his dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts and decent manners which adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and virtue The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and elegant Whenever Maximus appeared in public he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients  Clientum praevia pedisequa circumfusa populositas is the train which Sidonius himself l i epist assigns to another senator of consular rank  and it is possible that among these clients he might deserve and possess some real friends His merit was rewarded by the favour of the prince and senate he thrice exercised the office of Praetorian praefect of Italy he was twice invested with the consulship and he obtained the rank of patrician These civil honours were not incompatible with the enjoyment  of leisure and tranquillity his hours according to the demands of pleasure or reason were accurately distributed by a waterclock and this avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus entertained of his own happiness The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody revenge Yet a philosopher might have reflected that if the resistance of his wife had been sincere her chastity was still inviolate and that it could never be restored if she had consented to the will of the adulterer A patriot would have hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the royal house of Theodosius The imprudent Maximus disregarded these salutary considerations he gratified his resentment and ambition he saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet and he heard himself saluted emperor by the unanimous voice of the senate and people But the day of his inauguration was the last day of his happiness He was imprisoned such is the lively expression of Sidonius in the palace and after passing a sleepless night he sighed that he had attained the summit of his wishes and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation Oppressed by the weight of the diadem he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius and when he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life the emperor exclaimed  "O fortunate Damocles  Districtus ensis cui super impiâ  Cervice pendet non  Siculae dapes  Dulcem elaborabunt saporem  Non avium Citharaeque cantus  Somnum reducent  Horat Carm iii Sidonius concludes his letter with the story of Damocles which Cicero Tusculan v had so inimitably told    thy reign began and ended with the same dinner"  a wellknown allusion which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive lesson for princes and subjects  The reign of Maximus continued about three  His death A D June  months His hours of which he had lost the command were disturbed by remorse or guilt or terror and his throne was shaken by the seditions of the soldiers the people and the confederate Barbarians The marriage of his son Palladius with the eldest daughter of the late emperor might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his family but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge His own wife the cause of these tragic events had been seasonably removed by death and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning perhaps her real grief and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband These suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of Maximus himself and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride who was still conscious that she descended from a line of emperors From  the East however Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead her mother languished at Jerusalem in disgrace and exile and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the hands of a stranger She directed her eyes towards Carthage secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals and persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious designs by the specious names of honour justice and compassion  Notwithstanding the evidence of Procopius Evagrius Idatius Marcellinus c the learned Muratori Annali d'Italia tom iv p doubts the reality of this invitation and observes with great truth "Non si può dir quanto sia facile il popolo a sognare e "spacciar voci false" But his argument from the interval of time and place is extremely feeble The figs which grew near Carthage were produced to the senate of Rome on the third day  Whatever abilities Maximus might have shewn in a subordinate station he was found incapable of administering an empire and though he might easily have been informed of the naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of Africa he expected with supine indifference the approach of the enemy without adopting any measures of defence of negociation or of a timely retreat When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth of the Tyber the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exasperated multitude The only hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a precipitate flight and he exhorted the senators to imitate the example of their prince But no  sooner did Maximus appear in the streets than he was assaulted by a shower of stones a Roman or a Burgundian soldier claimed the honour of the first wound his mangled body was ignominiously cast into the Tyber the Roman people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the author of the public calamities and the domestics of Eudoxia signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress  Infidoque tibi Burgundio ductu  Extorquet trepidas mactandi principis iras  Sidon in Panegyr Avit A remarkable line which insinuates that Rome and Maximus were betrayed by their Burgundian mercenaries    On the third day after the tumult Genseric  Sack of Rome by the Vandals A D June  boldly advanced from the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city Instead of a sally of the Roman youth there issued from the gates an unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his clergy  The apparent success of pope Leo may be justified by Prosper and the  Historia Miscellan  but the improbable notion of Baronius A D No that Genseric spared the three apostolical churches is not countenanced even by the doubtful testimony of the  Liber Pontificalis  The fearless spirit of Leo his authority and eloquence  again  mitigated the fierceness of a Barbarian conqueror the king of the Vandals promised to spare the unresisting multitude to protect the buildings from fire and to exempt the captives from torture and although such orders were neither seriously given nor strictly obeyed the mediation of Leo was glorious to himself and in some degree beneficial to his country But Rome and its inhabitants were  delivered to the licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors whose blind passions revenged the injuries of Carthage The pillage lasted fourteen days and nights and all that yet remained of public or private wealth of sacred or profane treasure was diligently transported to the vessels of Genseric Among the spoils the splendid relics of two temples or rather of two religions exhibited a memorable example of the vicissitude of human and divine things Since the abolition of Paganism the Capitol had been violated and abandoned yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands of Genseric  The profusion of Catulus the first who gilt the roof of the Capitol was not universally approved Plin Hist Natur xxxiii but it was far exceeded by the emperor's and the external gilding of the temple cost Domitian talents l The expressions of Claudian and Rutilius  luce metalli aemula fastigia astris  and  confunduntque vagos delubra micantia visus  manifestly prove that this splendid covering was not removed either by the Christians or the Goths See Donatus Roma Antiqua l ii c p It should seem that the roof of the Capitol was decorated with gilt statues and chariots drawn by four horses  The holy instruments of the Jewish worship  The curious reader may consult the learned and accurate treatise of Hadrian Reland de Spoliis Templi Hierosolymitani in Arcû Titiano Romae conspicuis in mo Trajecti ad Rhenum  the gold table and the gold candlestick with seven branches originally framed according to the particular instructions of God himself and which were placed in the sanctuary of his temple had been ostentatiously displayed to the Roman people in the triumph of Titus They were afterwards deposited in the temple of Peace  and at the end of four hundred years the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to Carthage by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores of the Baltic These ancient monuments might attract the notice of curiosity as well as of avarice But the Christian churches enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege and the pious liberality of pope Leo who melted six silver vases the gift of Constantine each of an hundred pounds weight is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair In the fortyfive years that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion the pomp and luxury of Rome were in some measure restored and it was difficult either to escape or to satisfy the avarice of a conqueror who possessed leisure to collect and ships to transport the wealth of the capital The imperial ornaments of the palace the magnificent furniture and wardrobe the sideboards of massy plate were accumulated with disorderly rapine the gold and silver amounted to several thousand talents yet even the brass and copper were laboriously removed Eudoxia herself who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct She was rudely stripped of her jewels and the unfortunate empress with her two daughters the only surviving remains of the great Theodosius was compelled as a captive to follow the haughty Vandal who immediately hoisted sail and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port  of Carthage  The vessel which transported the relics of the Capitol was the only one of the whole fleet that suffered shipwreck If a bigoted sophist a Pagan bigot had mentioned the accident he might have rejoiced that this cargo of sacrilege was lost in the sea  Many thousand Romans of both sexes chosen for some useful or agreeable qualifications reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of Genseric and their distress was aggravated by the unfeeling Barbarians who in the division of the booty separated the wives from their husbands and the children from their parents The charity of Deogratias bishop of Carthage  See Victor Vitensis de Persecut Vandal l i c p edit Ruinart Deogratias governed the church of Carthage only three years If he had not been privately buried his corpse would have been torn piecemeal by the mad devotion of the people  was their only consolation and support He generously sold the gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of some to alleviate the slavery of others and to assist the wants and infirmities of a captive multitude whose health was impaired by the hardships which they had suffered in the passage from Italy to Africa By his order two spacious churches were converted into hospitals the sick were distributed in convenient beds and liberally supplied with food and medicines and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and night with an assiduity that surpassed his strength and a tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services Compare this scene with the field of Cannae and judge between Hannibal

ambition of the Goths seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests The emperor Maximus relieved himself by a judicious choice from the weight of these distant cares he silenced the solicitations of his friends listened to the voice of fame and promoted a stranger to the general command of the forces in Gaul Avitus  The private life and elevation of Avitus must be deduced with becoming suspicion from the panegyric pronounced by Sidonius Apollinaris his subject and his soninlaw  the stranger whose merit was so nobly rewarded descended from a wealthy and honourable family in the diocese of Auvergne The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace with the same ardour the civil and military professions and the indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in the public service he alternately displayed his talents in war and negociation and the soldier of Aetius after executing the most important embassies was raised to the station of Praetorian praefect of Gaul Either the merit of Avitus excited envy or his moderation was desirous of repose since he calmly retired to an estate  which he possessed in the neighbourhood of Clermont A copious stream issuing from the mountain and falling headlong in many a loud and foaming cascade discharged its waters into a lake about two miles in length and the villa was pleasantly seated on the margin of the lake The baths the porticoes the summer and winter apartments were adapted to the purposes of luxury and use and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of woods pastures and meadows  After the example of the younger Pliny Sidonius l ii c has laboured the florid prolix and obscure description of his villa which bore the name  Avitacum  and had been the property of Avitus The precise situation is not ascertained Consult however the notes of Savaron and Sirmond  In this retreat where Avitus amused his leisure with books rural sports the practice of husbandry and the society of his friends  Sidonius l ii epist has described the country life of the Gallic nobles in a visit

authors profane and religious the former for the men the latter for the ladies The table was twice served at dinner and supper with hot meat boiled and roast and wine During the intermediate time the

the Barbarians suspended their fury and whatever means he might employ whatever concessions he might be forced to make the people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity But the fate of Gaul depended on the Visigoths and the Roman  general less attentive to his dignity than to the public interest did not disdain to visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador He was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric the king of the Goths but while Avitus laid the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful nation he was astonished by the intelligence that the emperor Maximus was slain and that Rome had been pillaged by the Vandals A vacant throne which he might ascend without guilt or danger tempted his ambition  Seventy lines of panegyric which describe the

Imperial diadem from the representatives of Gaul and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the Barbarians and provincials The formal consent of Marcian emperor of the East was solicited and

the orator satisfies the curiosity of one of his friends in the following description  This elaborate description l i ep ii p was dictated by some political motive It was designed for the public eye and had been shewn by the friends of Sidonius before it was inserted in the collection of his epistles The first book was published separately See Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xvi p    "By the majesty of his appearance Theodoric would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit and although he is born a prince his merit would dignify a private station He is of a middle stature his body appears rather plump than fat and in his wellproportioned  limbs agility is united with muscular strength  I have suppressed in this portrait of Theodoric several minute circumstances and technical phrases which could be tolerable or indeed intelligible to those only who like the contemporaries of Sidonius had frequented the markets where naked slaves were exposed to sale Dubos Hist Critique tom i p  If you examine his countenance you will distinguish a high forehead large shaggy eyebrows an aquiline nose thin lips a regular set of white teeth and a fair complexion that blushes more frequently from modesty than from anger The ordinary distribution of his time as far as it is exposed to the public view may be concisely represented Before daybreak he repairs with a small train to his domestic chapel where the service is performed by the Arian clergy but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and policy The rest of the morning is employed in the administration of his kingdom His chair is surrounded by some military officers of decent aspect and behaviour the noisy crowd of his Barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience but they are not permitted to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the councilchamber from vulgar eyes The ambassadors of the nations are successively introduced Theodoric listens with attention answers them with discreet brevity and either announces or delays according to the nature of their business his final resolution About eight the second hour he rises from his throne and visits  either his treasury or his stables If he chuses to hunt or at least to exercise himself on horseback his bow is carried by a favourite youth but when the game is marked he bends it with his own hand and seldom misses the object of his aim as a king he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare but as a soldier he would blush to accept any military service which he could perform himself On common days his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen but every Saturday many honourable guests are invited to the royal table which on these occasions is served with the elegance of Greece the plenty of Gaul and the order and diligence of Italy  Videas ibi elegantiam Graecam abundantiam Gallicanam celeritatem Italam publicam pompam

and costly luxury the size and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance and the respectful silence that prevails is interrupted only by grave and instructive conversation After dinner Theodoric sometimes indulges himself in a short slumber and as soon as he wakes he calls for the dice and tables encourages his friends to forget the royal majesty and is delighted when they freely express the passions which are excited by the incidents of play At this game which he loves as the image of war  he alternately displays his eagerness his skill his patience and his cheerful temper If he loses he laughs he is modest and silent if he wins Yet notwithstanding this seeming indifference his courtiers chuse to solicit any favour in the moments of victory and I myself in my applications to the king have derived some benefit from my losses  Tunc etiam ego aliquid obsecraturus feliciter vincor et mihi tabula perit ut causa salvetur Sidonius of Auvergne was not a subject of Theodoric but he might be compelled to solicit either justice or favour at the court of Thoulouse  About the ninth hour three o'clock the tide of business again returns and flows incessantly till after sunset when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of suppliants and pleaders At the supper a more familiar repast buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced to divert not to offend the company by their ridiculous wit but female singers and the soft effeminate modes of music are severely banished and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of valour are alone grateful to the ear of Theodoric He retires from table and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the entrance of the treasury the palace and the private apartments"  When the king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the purple he offered his person  His expedition into Spain A D  and his forces as a faithful soldier of the republic  Theodoric himself had given a solemn and voluntary promise of fidelity which was understood both in Gaul and Spain  Romae sum te duce Amicus  Principe te MILES  Sidon Panegyr Avit    The exploits of Theodoric soon convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors After the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain and the passage of the Vandals into Africa the Suevi who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia aspired to the conquest of Spain and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the Roman dominion The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona afflicted by an hostile invasion represented their injuries and their apprehensions Count Fronto was dispatched in the name of the emperor Avitus with advantageous offers of peace and alliance and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation to declare that unless his brotherinlaw the king of the Suevi immediately retired he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome  "Tell him" replied the haughty Rechiarius "that I despise his friendship and his arms but that I shall soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulouse"  Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy he passed the Pyrenees at the head of the Visigoths the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus he privately stipulated for himself and his successors the absolute  possession of his Spanish conquests The two armies or rather the two nations encountered each other on the banks of the river Urbicus about twelve miles from Astorga and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi From the field of battle Theodoric advanced to Braga their metropolis which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity  Quaeque sinû pelagi jactat se Bracara dives  Auson de Claris Urbibus p  From the design of the king of the Suevi it is evident that the navigation from the ports of Gallicia to the Mediterranean was known and practised The ships of Bracara or Braga cautiously steered along the coast without daring to lose themselves in the Atlantic  His entrance was not polluted with blood and the Goths respected the chastity of their female captives more especially of the consecrated virgins but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight he was delivered to his implacable rival and Rechiarius who neither desired nor expected mercy received with manly constancy the death which he would probably have inflicted After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida the principal town of Lusitania without meeting any resistance except from the miraculous powers of St Eulalia but he was stopped in  the full career of success and recalled from Spain before he could provide for the security of his conquests In his retreat towards the Pyrenees he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed and in the sack of Pollentia and Astorga he shewed himself a faithless ally as well as a cruel enemy Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus the reign of Avitus had expired and both the honour and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend whom he had seated on the throne of the Western empire  This Suevic was is the most authentic part of the Chronicle of Idatius who as bishop of Iria

and orators Sidon Apoll l ix epist p Carm viii p  seems to contain a very moderate proportion either of genius or of truth The poet if we may degrade that sacred name exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was  soon contradicted by the event Avitus at a time when the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and danger indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury age had not extinguished his amorous inclinations and he is accused of insulting with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery the husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated  Luxuriose agere volens a senatoribus projectus est is the concise expression of Gregory of Tours l ii c xi in tom ii p An old Chronicle in tom ii p mentions an indecent jest of Avitus which seems more applicable to Rome than to Treves  But the Romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues The several parts of the empire became every day more alienated from each other and the stranger of Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt The senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor and their authority which had been originally derived from the old constitution was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining monarchy Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an unarmed senate if their discontent had not been supported or perhaps inflamed by Count Ricimer one of the principal commanders of the Barbarian troops who formed the military defence of Italy The daughter of Wallia king of the Visigoths was the mother of Ricimer but he was descended on the father's side from the nation of the Suevi  Sidonius Panegyr Anthem c praises the royal birth of Ricimer the lawful heir as he chuses to insinuate both of the Gothic and Suevic kingdoms    his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his countrymen and he obeyed with reluctance an emperor in whose elevation he had not been consulted His faithful and important services against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable  See the Chronicle of Idatius Jornandes c p styles him with

with the appellation of the Deliverer of Italy He chose that moment to signify to Avitus that his reign was at an end and the feeble emperor at a distance from his Gothic allies was compelled after a short and unavailing struggle to abdicate the purple By the clemency however or the contempt of Ricimer  Parcens innocentiae Aviti is the compassionate but contemptuous language of Victor Tunnunensis in Chron apud Scaliger Euseb In another place he calls him vir totius simplicitatis This commendation is more humble but it is more solid and sincere than the praises of Sidonius  he was permitted to descend from the throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia but the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied and their inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death He fled towards the Alps with the humble hope not of arming the Visigoths in his cause but of securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian one of the tutelar saints of Auvergne  He

Avitus left only one daughter the wife of Sidonius Apollinaris who inherited the patrimony of his fatherinlaw lamenting at the same time the disappointment of his public and private expectations His resentment prompted him to join or at least to countenance the measures of a rebellious faction in Gaul and the poet had contracted some guilt which it was incumbent on him to expiate by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding emperor  After a modest appeal to the examples of his brethren Virgil and Horace Sidonius honestly confesses the debt and promises payment  Sic mihi diverso nuper sub

in the assurance that although the obsequious orator would have flattered with equal zeal the most worthless of princes the extraordinary merit of his object confined him on this occasion within the bounds of truth  The Panegyric was pronounced at Lyons before the end of the year while the emperor was still consul It has more art than genius and more labour than art The ornaments are false or trivial the expression is feeble and prolix and Sidonius wants the skill to exhibit the principal figure in a strong and distinct light The private life of Majorian occupies about two hundred lines  Majorian derived his name from his maternal grandfather who in the reign of the great Theodosius had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier He gave his daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian a respectable officer who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity and generously preferred the friendship of Aetius to the tempting offers of an insidious court His son the future emperor who was educated in the profession of arms displayed from his early youth intrepid courage premature  wisdom and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune He followed the standard of Aetius contributed to his success shared and sometimes eclipsed his glory and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician or rather of his wife who forced him to retire from the service  She pressed his immediate death and was scarcely satisfied with his disgrace It should seem that Aetius like Belisarius and Marlborough was governed by his wife whose fervent piety though it might work miracles Gregor Turon l ii c p was not incompatible with base and sanguinary counsels  Majorian after the death of Aetius was recalled and promoted and his intimate connection with count Ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the Western empire During the vacancy that succeeded the abdication of Avitus the ambitious Barbarian whose birth excluded him from the Imperial dignity governed Italy with the title of Patrician resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of mastergeneral of the cavalry and infantry and after an interval of some months consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans whose favour Majorian had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni  The Alemanni had passed the Rhaetian Alps and were deseated in the  Campi Canini  or Valley of Bellinzone through which the Tesin flows in its descent from mount Adula to the Lago Maggiore Cluver Italia Antiq tom i p This boasted victory over  nine hundred  Barbarians Panegyr Majorian c betrays the extreme weakness of Italy  He was invested with the purple at Ravenna and the epistle which he addressed to the senate will best describe his situation and his sentiments  "Your election Conscript

but meritorious Let none except the authors themselves be apprehensive of  delations  Either dilationes or delationes would afford a tolerable reading but there is much more sense and spirit in the latter to which I have therefore given the preference  which as a subject I have always condemned and as a prince will severely punish Our own vigilance and that of our father the patrician Ricimer shall regulate all military affairs and  provide for the safety of the Roman world which we have saved from foreign and domestic enemies  Ab externo hoste et a domesticâ clade liberavimus by the

nations of Africa c that he may escape the dangerous name of Avitus  You now understand the maxims of my government you may confide in the faithful love and sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the companion of your life and dangers who still glories in the name of senator and who is anxious that you should never repent of the judgment which you have pronounced in his favour"  The emperor who amidst the ruins of the Roman world revived the ancient language of law and liberty which Trajan would not have disclaimed must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age or the example of his predecessors  See the whole edict or epistle of Majorian to the senate Novell tit iv p Yet the expression  regnum nostrum  bears some taint of the age and does not mix kindly with the word  respublica  which he frequently repeats    The private and public actions of Majorian  His salutary laws A D  are very imperfectly known but his laws remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people who sympathized in their distress who had studied the causes of the decline of the empire and who was capable of applying as far as such reformation was  practicable judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders  See the laws of Majorian they are only nine in number but very long and various at the end of the Theodosian Code Novell l iv p Godefroy has not given any commentary on these additional pieces  His regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove or at least to mitigate the most intolerable grievances I From the first hour of his reign he was solicitous I translate his own words to relieve the  weary  fortunes of the provincials oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions  Fessas provincialium variâ atque multiplici tributorum exactione fortunas et extraordinariis fiscalium solutionum oneribus attritas c Novell Majorian tit iv p  With this view he granted an universal amnesty a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute of all debts which under any pretence the fiscal officers might demand from the people This wise dereliction of obsolete vexatious and unprofitable claims improved and purified the sources of the public revenue and the subject who could now look back without despair might labour with hope and gratitude for himself and for his country II In the assessment and collection of taxes Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates and suppressed the extraordinary commissions which had been introduced in the name of the emperor himself or of the Praetorian praefects The favourite servants who obtained such irregular powers were insolent in their behaviour and arbitrary in their demands they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals  and they were discontented if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury One instance of their extortion would appear incredible were it not authenticated by the legislator himself They exacted the whole payment in gold but they refused the current coin of the empire and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the Antonines The subject who was unprovided with these curious medals had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands or if he succeeded in the research his imposition was doubled according to the weight and value of the money of former times  The learned Greaves vol i p has found by a diligent inquiry that  aurei  of the Antonines weighed one hundred and eighteen and those of the fifth century only sixtyeight English grains Majorian gives currency to all gold coin excepting only the  Gallic solidus  from its deficiency not in the weight but in the standard  III  "The municipal corporations says the emperor the lesser senates so antiquity has justly styled them deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities and the sinews of the republic And yet so low are they now reduced by the injustice of magistrates and the venality of collectors that many of their members renouncing their dignity and their country have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile"  He urges and even compels their return to their respective cities but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise  of their municipal functions They are directed under the authority of the provincial magistrates to resume their office of levying the tribute but instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district they are only required to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public IV But Majorian was not ignorant that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered and he therefore revives the useful office of the  defenders of cities  He exhorts the people to elect in a full and free assembly some man of discretion and integrity who would dare to assert their privileges to represent their grievances to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority  The spectator who casts a mournful view over  The edifices of Rome  the ruins of ancient Rome is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals for the mischief which they had neither leisure nor power nor perhaps inclination to perpetrate The tempest of war might strike some lofty turrets to the ground but the destruction which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted slowly and silently during a period of ten centuries and the motives of interest that afterwards operated without shame or controul were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian The decay of  the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works The circus and theatres might still excite but they seldom gratified the desires of the people the temples which had escaped the zeal of the Christians were no longer inhabited either by gods or men the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and porticoes and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation whose repose was seldom disturbed either by study or business The monuments of consular or Imperial greatness were no longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials cheaper and more convenient than the distant quarry Specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome which stated the want of stones or bricks for some necessary service the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry or pretended repairs and the degenerate Romans who converted the spoil to their own emolument demolished with sacrilegious hands the labours of their ancestors Majorian who had often sighed over the desolation of the city applied a severe remedy to the growing evil  The whole edict Novell Majorian tit vi p is curious  Antiquarum aedium dissipatur speciosa constructio et ut aliquid reparetur magna diruuntur Hinc jam occasio nascitur ut etiam unusquisque privatum aedificium construens per gratiam judicum praesumere de publicis locis necessaria et transferre non dubitet c  With equal zeal but with less power Petrarch in the fourteenth century repeated the same complaints Vie de Petrarque tom i p If I prosecute this History I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the  city  of Rome an interesting object to which my plan was originally consined  He reserved to  the prince and senate the sole congnisance of the extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold two thousand pounds sterling on every magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous licence and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers by a severe whipping and the amputation of both their hands In the last instance the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment but his zeal arose from a generous principle and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages in which he would have desired and deserved to live The emperor conceived that it was his interest to increase the number of his subjects that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriagebed but the means which he employed to accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous and perhaps exceptionable kind The pious maids who consecrated their virginity to Christ were restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth year Windows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five years by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest relations or to the state Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate  to the guilt of adultery that if the criminal returned to Italy he might by the express declaration of Majorian be slain with impunity  The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian consular of Tuscany in a style of acrimonious reproof which sounds almost like personal resentment Novell tit ix p The law of Majorian which punished obstinate widows was soon afterwards repealed by his successor Severus Novell Sever tit i p    While the emperor Majorian assiduously laboured  Majorian prepares to invade Africa A D  to restore the happiness and virtue of the Romans he encountered the arms of Genseric from his character and situation their most formidable enemy A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris or Garigliano but the Imperial troops surprised and attacked the disorderly Barbarians who were encumbered with the spoils of Campania they were chaced with slaughter to their ships and their leader the king's brotherinlaw was found in the number of the slain  Sidon Panegyr Majorian  Such vigilance might announce the character of the new reign but the strictest vigilance and the most numerous forces were insufficient to protect the longextended coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval war The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majorian Rome expected from him alone the restitution of Africa and the design which he formed of attacking the Vandals in their new settlements was the result of bold and judicious policy If the intrepid emperor could have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy if he could  have revived in the field of Mars the manly exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals he might have marched against Genseric at the head of a  Roman  army Such a reformation of national manners might be embraced by the rising generation but it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy that to obtain some immediate advantage or to avert some impending danger they are forced to countenance and even to multiply the most pernicious abuses Majorian like the weakest of his predecessors was reduced to the disgraceful expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike subjects and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument so apt to recoil on the hand that used it Besides the confederates who were already engaged in the service of the empire the fame of his liberality and valour attracted the nations of the Danube the Borysthenes and perhaps of the Tanais Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila the Gepidae the Ostrogoths the Rugians the Burgundians the Suevi the Alani assembled in the plains of Liguria and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities  The review of the army and passage of the Alps contain the most tolerable passages of the Panegyric M de Buat Hist des Peuples c tom viii p is a more satisfactory commentator than either Savaron or Sirmond  They passed the Alps in a severe winter The emperor led the way on foot and in complete armour  sounding with his long staff the depth of the ice or snow and encouraging the Scythians who complained of the extreme cold by the cheerful assurance that they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa The citizens of Lyons had presumed to shut their gates they soon implored and experienced the clemency of Majorian He vanquished Theodoric in the field and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms The beneficial though precarious reunion of the greatest part of Gaul and Spain was the effect of persuasion as well as of force  is the just and forcible distinction of Priscus Excerpt Legat p in a short fragment which throws much light on the history of Majorian Jornandes has suppressed the defeat and alliance of the Visigoths which were solemnly proclaimed in Galicia and are marked in the Chronicle of Idatius  and the independent Bagaudae who had escaped or resisted the oppression of former reigns were disposed to confide in the virtues of Majorian His camp was filled with Barbarian allies his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectinate people but the emperor had foreseen that it was impossible without a maritime power to atchieve the conquest of Africa In the first Punic war the republic had exerted such incredible diligence that within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had been given in the forest a fleet of one hundred and sixty gallies proudly rode at anchor in the sea  Florus l ii c He amuses himself with the poetical fancy that the trees had been transformed into ships and indeed the whole transaction as it is related in the first book of Polybius deviates too much from the probable course of human events  Under circumstances  much less favourable Majorian equalled the spirit and perseverance of the ancient Romans The woods of the Apennine were felled the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum were restored Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public service and the Imperial navy of three hundred large gallies with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels was collected in the secure and capacious harbour of Carthagena in Spain  Interea duplici texis dum littore classem  Inferno superoque mari cedit omnis in aequor  Sylva tibi c  Sidon Panegyr Majorian  The number of ships which Priscus fixes at is magnified by an indefinite comparison with the fleets of Agamemnon Xerxes and Augustus  The intrepid countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a confidence of victory and if we might credit the historian Procopius his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence Anxious to explore with his own eyes the state of the Vandals he ventured after disguising the colour of his hair to visit Carthage in the character of his own ambassador and Genseric was afterwards mortified by the discovery that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined unless in the life of a hero  Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p When Genseric conducted his unknown guest into the arsenal of Carthage the arms clashed of their own accord Majorian had tinged his yellow locks with a black colour    Without the help of a personal interview Genseric was sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary He practised his  The loss of his fleet  customary arts of fraud and delay but he practised them without success His applications for peace became each hour more submissive and perhaps more sincere but the inflexible Majorian had adopted the ancient maxim that Rome could not be safe as long as Carthage existed in a hostile state The king of the Vandals distrusted the valour of his native subjects who were enervated by the luxury of the South  Spoliisque potitus  Immensis robur luxû jam perdidit omne  Quo valuit dum pauper erat  Panegyr Majorian  He afterwards applies to Genseric unjustly as it should seem the vices of his subjects  he suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people who abhorred him as an Arian tyrant and the desperate measure which he executed of reducing Mauritania into a desert  He burnt the villages and poisoned the springs Priscus p Dubos Hist Critique tom i

hundred bushels of corn Shaw's Travels p  could not defeat the operations of the Roman emperor who was at liberty to land his troops on any part of the African coast But Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects envious or apprehensive of their master's success Guided by their secret intelligence he surprised the unguarded  fleet in the bay of Carthagena many of the ships were sunk or taken or burnt and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a single day  Idatius who was safe in Gallicia from the power of Ricimer boldly and honestly declares Vandali per proditores admoniti c he dissembles however the name of the traitor  After this event the behaviour of the two antagonists shewed them superior to their fortune The Vandal instead of being elated by this accidental victory immediately renewed his solicitations for peace The emperor of the West who was capable of forming great designs and of supporting heavy disappointments consented to a treaty or rather to a suspension of arms in the full assurance that before he could restore his navy he should be supplied with provocations to justify a second war Majorian returned to Italy to prosecute his labours for the public happiness and as he was conscious of his own integrity he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life The recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude almost every description of civil and military officers were exasperated against the Reformer since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavoured to suppress and the patrician Rieimer impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated The virtues of Majorian could not protect him from the impetuous sedition which broke out in the camp  near Tortona at the foot of the Alps He was compelled to abdicate the Imperial purple five days after his abdication it was reported that he died of a dysentery  Procop de Bell Vandal l i c p The testimony of Idatius is fair and impartial  "Majorianum de Galliis Romam redeuntem et Romano imperio vel nomini res necessarias ordinantem Richimer livore percitus et  invidorum  consilio fultus fraude interficit circumventum"  Some read  Suevorum  and I am unwilling to efface either of the words as they express the different accomplices who united in the conspiracy against Majorian  and the humble tomb  His death A D August  which covered his remains was consecrated by the respect and gratitude of succeeding generations  See the Epigrams of Ennodius No cxxxv inter Sirmond Opera tom i p It is flat and obscure but Ennodius was made bishop of Pavia fifty years after the death of Majorian and his praise deserves credit and regard  The private character of Majorian inspired love and respect Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation or if he himself were the object his contempt but he protected the freedom of wit and in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of his friends he could indulge his taste for pleasantry without degrading the majesty of his rank  Sidonius gives a tedious account l i epist xi p of a supper at Arles to which he was invited by Majorian a short time before his death He had no intention of praising a deceased emperor but a casual disinterested remark  "Subrisit Augustus ut erat auctoritate servatâ cum se communioni dedisset joci plenus"  outweighs the six hundred lines of his venal panegyric    It was not perhaps without some regret that  Ricimer reigns under the name of Severus A D  Ricimer sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition but he resolved in a second choice to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit At his command the obsequious  senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus who ascended the throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition History has scarcely deigned to notice his birth his elevation his character or his death Severus expired as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron  Sidonius Panegyr Anthem dismisses him to heaven  Auxerat Augustus naturae lege Severus  Divorum numerum  And an old list of the emperors composed about the time of Justinian praises his piety and fixes his residence at Rome Sirmond Not ad Sidon p  and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of six years between the death of Majorian and the elevation of Anthemius During that period the government was in the hands of Ricimer alone and although the modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king he accumulated treasures formed a separate army negociated private alliances and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric But his dominions were bounded by the Alps and two Roman generals Marcellinus and Aegidius maintained their allegiance to the Republic by rejecting with disdain the phantom which he styled an emperor Marcellinus still adhered to the old  Revolt of Marcellinus in Dalmatia  religion and the devout Pagans who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state applauded his profound skill in the science of divination But he possessed the more valuable  qualifications of learning virtue and courage  Tillemont who is always scandalized by the virtues of Infidels attributes this advantageous portrait of Marcellinus which Suidas has preserved to the partial zeal of some Pagan historian Hist des Empereurs tom vi p  the study of the Latin literature had improved his taste and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Aetius in whose ruin he was involved By a timely flight Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the Western empire His voluntary or reluctant submission to the authority of Majorian was rewarded by the government of Sicily and the command of an army stationed in that island to oppose or to attack the Vandals but his Barbarian mercenaries after the emperor's death were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer At the head of a band of faithful followers the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia assumed the title of patrician of the West secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the Hadriatic and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of Africa  Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p In various circumstances of the life of Marcellinus it is not easy to reconcile the Greek historian with the Latin Chronicles of the times  Aegidius the mastergeneral of Gaul who equalled or at least who imitated the heroes  and of Aegidius in Gaul  of ancient Rome  I must apply to Aegidius the praises which Sidonius Panegyr Majorian bestows on a nameless mastergeneral who commanded the rearguard of Majorian Idatius from public report commends his Christian piety and Priscus mentions p his military virtues  proclaimed his immortal  resentment against the assassins of his beloved master A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard and though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer and the arms of the Visigoths from marching to the gates of Rome he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps and rendered the name of Aegidius respectable both in peace and war The Franks who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric elected the Roman general for their king his vanity rather than his ambition was gratified by that singular honour and when the nation at the end of four years repented of the injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince The authority of Aegidius ended only with his life and the suspicions of poison and secret violence which derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls  Greg Turon l ii c in tom ii p The Pero Daniel whose ideas were superficial and modern has started some objections against the story of Childeric Hist de France tom i Preface Historique p lxxviii c but they have been fairly satisfied by Dubos Hist Critique tom i p and by two authors who disputed the prize of the Academy of Soissons p With regard to the term of Childeric's exile it is necessary either to prolong the life of Aegidius beyond the date assigned by the Chronicle of Idatius or to correct the text of Gregory by reading  quarto  anno instead of  octa  o    The kingdom of Italy a name to which the  Naval war of the Vandals A D  Western empire was gradually reduced was  afflicted under the reign of Ricimer by the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates  The naval war of Genseric is described by Priscus Excerpta Legation p Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p and c p Victor Vitensis de Persecut Vandal l i c and Ruinart p and in the three panegyrics of Sidonius whose chronological order is absurdly transposed in the editions both of Savaron and Sirmond Avit Carm vii Majorian v Anthem Carm ii In one passage the poet seems inspired by his subject and expresses a strong idea by a lively image  Hinc Vandalus hostis  Urget et in nostrum numerosâ classe quotannis  Militat excidium conversoque ordine Fati  Torrida Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furores  In the spring of each year they equipped a formidable navy in the port of Carthage and Genseric himself though in a very advanced age still commanded in person the most important expeditions His designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy till the moment that he hoisted sail When he was asked by his pilot what course he should steer  "Leave the determination to the winds replied the Barbarian with pious arrogance  they  will transport us to the guilty coast whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice"  but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain Liguria Tuscany Campania Lucania Bruttium Apulia Calabria Venetia Dalmatia Epirus Greece and Sicily they were tempted to subdue the island of Sardinia so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean  and their arms spread desolation or terror from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory they seldom attacked any fortified cities or engaged any regular troops in the open field But the celerity of their motions enabled them almost at the same time to threaten and to attack the most distant objects which attracted their desires and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses they had no sooner landed than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry Yet notwithstanding the example of their king the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished and their sons who were born in Africa enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valour of their fathers Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans of captives and outlaws and those desperate wretches who had already violated the laws of their country were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners he sometimes consulted his avarice and sometimes indulged his cruelty and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Zacynthus whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian sea was imputed by the public indignation to his latest posterity  Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations but the war which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman empire  Negociations with the Eastern empire A D c  was justified by a specious and reasonable motive The widow of Valentinian Eudoxia whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house her elder daughter Eudocia became the reluctant wife of Hunneric his eldest son and the stern father asserting a legal claim which could not easily be refuted or satisfied demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony An adequate or at least a valuable compensation was offered by the Eastern emperor to purchase a necessary peace Eudoxia and her younger daughter Placidia were honourably restored and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Western empire The Italians destitute of a naval force which alone was capable of protecting their coasts implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East who had formerly acknowledged in peace and war the supremacy of Rome But the perpetual division of the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations the faith of a recent treaty was alleged and the Western Romans instead of arms and ships could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation The haughty Ricimer who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation was at length reduced to address the throne of Constantinople in the humble language of a subject and Italy submitted  as the price and security of the alliance to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the East  The poet himself is compelled to acknowledge the distress of Ricimer  Praeterea invict us Ricimer quem publica fata  Respiciunt  proprio  solus vix  Marte  repellit  Piratam per rura vagum  Italy addresses her complaint to the Tyber and Rome at the solicitation of the river god transports herself to Constantinople renounces her ancient claims and implores the friendship of Aurora the goddess of the East This fabulous machinery which the genius of Claudian had used and abused is the constant and miserable resource of the muse of Sidonius  It is not the purpose of the present chapter or even of the present volume to continue the distinct series of the Byzantine history but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor Leo may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West  The original authors of the reigns of Marcian Leo and Zeno are reduced to some imperfect fragments whose deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations of Theophanes Zonaras and Cedrenus    Since the death of the younger Theodosius the domestic repose of Constantinople had never been  Leo emperor of the East A D  interrupted by war or faction Pulcheria had bestowed her hand and the sceptre of the East on the modest virtue of Marcian he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity and after her death he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint  St Pulcheria died A D four years before her nominal husband and her festival is celebrated on the th of September by the modern Greeks she bequeathed an immense patrimony to pious or at least to ecclesiastical uses See Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xv p  Attentive  to the prosperity of his own dominions Marcian seemed to behold with indifference the misfortunes of Rome and the obstinate refusal of a a brave and active prince to draw his sword against the Vandals was ascribed to a secret promise which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric  See Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p  The death of Marcian after a reign of seven years would have exposed the East to the danger of a popular election if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favour of the candidate whose interest they supported The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed  From this disability of Aspar to acend the throne it may be inferred that the stain of  Heresy  was perpetual and indelible while that of  Barbarism  disappeared in the second generation  During three generations the armies of the East were successively commanded by his father by himself and by his son Ardaburius his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was powerful He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace a military tribune and the principal steward of his household His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate and the servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop who was permitted to express by this unusual ceremony  the suffrage of the Deity  Theophanes p This appears to be the first origin of a ceremony which all the Christian princes of the world have since adopted and from which the clergy have deduced the most formidable consequences  This emperor the first of the name of Leo has been distinguished by the title of the  Great  from a succession of princes who gradually fixed in the opinion of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic or at least of royal perfection Yet the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor shewed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative Aspar was astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople he presumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise and insolently shaking his purple  "It is not proper said he that the man who is invested with this garment should be guilty of lying"  "Nor is it proper replied Leo that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment and the public interest to the will of a subject  Cedrenus p who was conversant with the writers of better days has preserved the remarkable words of Aspar    "  After this extraordinary scene it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere or at least that it could be solid and permanent An army of Isaurians  The power of the Isaurians agitated the Eastern empire in the two succeeding reigns of Zeno and Anastasius but it ended in the destruction of those Barbarians who maintained their fierce independence about two hundred and thirty years  was secretly levied and introduced into Constantinople and  while Leo undermined the authority and prepared the disgrace of the family of Aspar his mild and cautious behaviour restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts which might have been fatal to themselves or their enemies The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favour the cause of Genseric When Leo had delivered himself from that ignominious servitude he listened to the complaints of the Italians resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals and declared his alliance with his colleague Anthemius whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West  The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been  Anthemius emperor of the West A D  magnified since the Imperial descent which he could only deduce from the usurper Procopius has been swelled into a line of emperors  Tali tu civis ab urbe  Procopio genitore micas cui prisca propago  Augustis  venit a  proavis  The poet Sidon Panegyr Anthem then proceeds to relate the private life and fortunes of the future emperor with which he must have been very imperfectly acquainted  But the merit of his immediate parents their honours and their riches rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the East His father Procopius obtained after his Persian embassy the rank of general and patrician and the name of Anthemius was derived from his maternal  grandfather the celebrated praefect who protected with so much ability and success the infant reign of Theodosius The grandson of the praefect was raised above the condition of a private subject by his marriage with Euphemia the daughter of the emperor Marcian This splendid alliance which might supersede the necessity of merit hastened the promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count of mastergeneral of consul and of patrician and his merit or fortune claimed the honours of a victory which was obtained on the banks of the Danube over the Huns Without indulging an extravagant ambition the soninlaw of Marcian might hope to be his successor but Anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and patience and his subsequent elevation was universally approved by the public who esteemed him worthy to reign till he ascended the throne  Sidonius discovers with tolerable ingenuity that this disappointment added new lustre to the virtues of Anthemius c who declined one sceptre and reluctantly accepted another c  The emperor of the West marched from Constantinople attended by several counts of high distinction and a body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular army he entered Rome in triumph and the choice of Leo  A D April  was confirmed by the senate the people and the Barbarian confederates of Italy  The poet again celebrates the unanimity of all orders of the state and the Chronicle of Idatius mentions the forces which attended his march  The solemn  inauguration of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the patrician Ricimer a fortunate event which was considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the state The wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed and many senators completed their ruin by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty All serious business was suspended during this festival the courts of justice were shut the streets of Rome the theatres the places of public and private resort resounded with hymenaeal songs and dances and the royal bride clothed in silken robes with a crown on her head was conducted to the palace of Ricimer who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator On this memorable occasion Sidonius whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted appeared as the orator of Auvergne among the provincial deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints  Interveni autem nuptiis Patricii Ricimeris cui filia perennis Augusti in spem publicae securitatis copulabatur The journey of Sidonius from Lyons and the festival of Rome are described with some spirit L i epist p Epist p  The calends of January were now approaching and the venal poet who had loved  A D January  Avitus and esteemed Majorian was persuaded by his friends to celebrate in heroic verse the merit the felicity the second consulship and the future triumphs of the emperor Anthemius Sidonius pronounced with assurance and success a panegyric which is still extant and whatever might be the imperfections either of the subject  or of the composition the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the praefecture of Rome a dignity which placed him among the illustrious personages of the empire till he wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop and a saint  Sidonius l i epist p very fairly states his motive his labour and his reward "Hic ipse Panegyricus si non "judicium certe eventum boni operis accepit" He was made bishop of Clermont A D Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xvi p    The Greeks ambitiously commend the piety  The festival of the Lupercalia  and catholic faith of the emperor whom they gave to the West nor do they forget to observe that when he left Constantinople he converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public bath a church and an hospital for old men  The palace of Anthemius stood on the banks of the Propontis In the ninth century Alexius the soninlaw of the emperor Theophilus obtained permission to purchase the ground and ended his days in a monastery which he founded on that delightful spot Ducange Constantinopolis Christiana p  Yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius From the conversation of Philotheus a Macedonian sectary he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration and the Heretics of Rome would have assembled with impunity if the bold and vehement censure which pope Hilary pronounced in the church of St Peter had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence  Papa Hilarus apud beatum Petrum Apostolum palam ne id fieret clarâ voce constrinxit in tantum ut non ea facienda cum interpositione juramenti idem promitteret Imperator Gelasius Epistol ad Andronicum apud Baron A D No The cardinal observes with some complacency that it was much easier to plant heresies at Constantinople than at Rome  Even the Pagans a feeble  and obscure remnant conceived some vain hopes from the indifference or partiality of Anthemius and his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus whom he promoted to the consulship was ascribed to a secret project of reviving the ancient worship of the Gods  Damascius in the life of the philosopher Isidore apud Photium p Damascius who lived under Justinian composed another work consisting of praeternatural stories of souls daemons apparitions the dotage of Platonic Paganism  These idols were crumbled into dust and the mythology which had once been the creed of nations was so universally disbelieved that it might be employed without scandal or at least without suspicion by Christian poets  In the poetical works of Sidonius which he afterwards condemned l ix epist p the fabulous deities are the principal actors If Jerom was scourged by the angels for only reading Virgil the bishop of Clermont for such a vile imitation deserved an additional whipping from the muses  Yet the vestiges of superstition were not absolutely obliterated and the festival of the Lupercalia whose origin had preceded the foundation of Rome was still celebrated under the reign of Anthemius The savage and simple rites were expressive of an early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture The rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral life Pan Faunus and their train of satyrs were such as the fancy of shepherds might create sportive petulant and lascivious whose power was limited and whose malice was inoffensive A  goat was the offering the best adapted to their character and attributes the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits and the riotous youths who crowded to the feast ran naked about the fields with leather thongs in their hands communicating as it was supposed the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they touched  Ovid Fast l ii has given an amusing description of the follies of antiquity which still inspired so much respect that a grave magistrate running naked through the streets was not an object of astonishment or laughter  The altar of Pan was erected perhaps by Evander the Arcadian in a dark recess in the side of the Palatinehill watered by a perpetual fountain and shaded by an hanging grove A tradition that in the same place Romulus and Remus were suckled by the wolf rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of the Romans and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum  See Dionys Halicarn l i p edit Hudson The Roman Antiquaries Donatus l ii c p and Nardini p have laboured to ascertain the true situation of the Lupercal  After the conversion of the Imperial city the Christians still continued in the month of February the annual celebration of the Lupercalia to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world The bishops of Rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity but their zeal was not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate the inveterate abuse subsisted  till the end of the fifth century and pope Gelasius who purified the capital from the last stain of idolatry appeased by a formal apology the murmurs of the senate and people  Baronius published from the MSS of the Vatican this epistle of pope Gelasius A D No which is entitled Adversus Andromachum Senatorem caeterosque Romanos qui Lupercalia secundum morem pristinum colenda constituebant Gelasius always supposes that his adversaries are nominal Christians and that he may not yield to them in absurd prejudice he imputes to this harmless festival all the  calamities  of the age    In all his public declarations the emperor Leo  Preparations against the Vandals of Africa A D  assumes the authority and professes the affection of a father for his son Anthemius with whom he had divided the administration of the universe  Itaque nos quibus totius mundi regimen commisit superna provisio Pius et triumphator semper Augustus filius noster Anthemius licet Divina Majestas et nostra creatio pietati ejus plenam Imperii commiserit potestatem c Such is the dignified style of Leo whom Anthemius respectfully names Dominus et Pater meus Princeps sacratissimus Leo See Novell Anthem tit ii iii p ad calcem Cod Theod  The situation and perhaps the character of Leo dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an African war But the powers of the Eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver Italy and the Mediterranean from the Vandals and Genseric who had so long oppressed both the land and sea was threatened from every side with a formidable invasion The campaign was opened by a bold and successful enterprise of the praefect Heraclius  The expedition of Heraclius is clouded with difficulties Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p and it requires some dexterity to use the circumstances afforded by Theophanes without injury to the more respectable evidence of Procopius  The troops of Egypt  Thebais and Libya were embarked under his command and the Arabs with a train of horses and camels opened the roads of the desert Heraclius landed on the coast of Tripoli surprised and subdued the cities of that province and prepared by a laborious march which Cato had formerly executed  The march of Cato from Berenice in the province of Cyrene was much longer than that of Heraclius from Tripoli He passed the deep sandy desert in thirty days and it was found necessary to provide besides the ordinary supplies a great number of skins filled with water and several  Psylli  who were supposed to possess the art of sucking the wounds which had been made by the serpents of their native country See Plutarch in Caton Uticens tom iv p Strabon Geograph l xvii p  to join the Imperial army under the walls of Carthage The intelligence of this loss extorted from Genseric some insidious and ineffectual propositions of peace but he was still more seriously alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires The independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate title of Anthemius whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome the Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbours of Italy the active valour of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the island of Sardinia and the languid efforts of the West added some weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans The expence of the naval armament which Leo sent against the Vandals has been distinctly ascertained and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire The royal demesnes or private patrimony of the prince supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold fortyseven  thousand pounds of gold and seven hundred thousand of silver were levied and paid into the treasury by the Praetorian praefects But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures as a valuable object of the revenue does not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration The whole expence by whatsoever means it was defrayed of the African campaign amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold about five millions two hundred thousand pounds sterling at a time when the value of money appears from the comparative price of corn to have been somewhat higher than in the present age  The principal sum is clearly expressed by Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c vi p the smaller constituent parts which Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p has laboriously collected from the Byzantine writers are less certain and less important The historian Malchus laments the public misery Excerpt ex Suida in Corp Hist Byzant p but he is surely unjust when he charges Leo with hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people  The fleet that sailed from Constantinople to Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand men Basiliscus the brother of the empress Vorina was entrusted with this important command His sister the wife of Leo had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians But the discovery of his guilt or incapacity was reserved for the African war and his friends could only save his military reputation by asserting that he had conspired with Aspar to spare Genseric  and to betray the last hope of the Western empire  Experience has shewn that the success of an invader most commonly depends on the vigour  Failure of the expedition  and celerity of his operations The strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by delay the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in a distant climate the naval and military force a mighty effort which perhaps can never be repeated is silently consumed and every hour that is wasted in negociation accustoms the enemy to contemplate and examine those hostile terrors which on their first appearance he deemed irresistible The formidable navy of Basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian Bosphorus to the coast of Africa He landed his troops at Cape Bona or the promontory of Mercury about forty miles from Carthage  This promontory is forty miles from Carthage Procop l i c p and twenty leagues from Sicily Shaw's Travels p Scipio landed farther in the bay at the fair promontory see the animated deseription of Livy xxix  The army of Heraclius and the fleet of Marcellinus either joined or seconded the Imperial lieutenant and the Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land were successively vanquished  Theophanes p affirms that many ships of the Vandals were sunk The assertion of Jornandes de Successione Regn that Basiliscus attacked Carthage must be understood in a very qualisied sense  If Basiliscus had seized the moment of consternation and boldly advanced to the capital Carthage must have surrendered and the  kingdom of the Vandals was extinguished Genseric beheld the danger with firmness and eluded it with his veteran dexterity He protested in the most respectful language that he was ready to submit his person and his dominions to the will of the emperor but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission and it was universally believed that his secret liberality contributed to the success of this public negociation Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly solicited the guilty or the credulous Basiliscus consented to the fatal truce and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa During this short interval the wind became favourable to the designs of Genseric He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors and Vandals and they towed after them many large barks filled with combustible materials In the obscurity of the night these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence and the noise of the wind the crackling of the flames the dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners who could neither command nor obey increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult Whilst they laboured to extricate themselves from the fireships and to save at least a part of the  navy the gallies of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valour and many of the Romans who escaped the fury of the flames were destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals Among the events of that disastrous night the heroic or rather desperate courage of John one of the principal officers of Basiliscus has rescued his name from oblivion When the ship which he had bravely defended was almost consumed he threw himself in his armour into the sea disdainfully rejected the esteem and pity of Genso the son of Genseric who pressed him to accept honourable quarter and sunk under the waves exclaiming with his last breath that he would never fall alive into the hands of those impious dogs Actuated by a far different spirit Basiliscus whose station was the most remote from danger disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his fleet and army and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of St Sophia till his sister by her tears and entreaties could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert Marcellinus retired to Sicily where he was assassinated perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer by one of his own captains and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the Romans themselves should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists  Damascius in Vit Isidor apud Phot p It will appear by comparing the three short chronicles of the times that Marcellinus had fought near Carthage and was killed in Sicily  After the failure  of this great expedition Genseric again became the tyrant of the sea the coasts of Italy Greece and Asia were again exposed to his revenge and avarice Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience he added Sicily to the number of his provinces and before he died in the fulness of years and of glory he beheld the final extinction  A D  of the empire of the West

their sister  Jornandes is our best guide through the reigns of Theodoric II and Euric de Rebus Geticis c p Idatius ends too soon and Isidore is too sparing of the information which he might have given on the affairs of Spain The events that relate to Gaul are laboriously illustrated in the third book of the Abbé Dubos Hist Critique tom i p  The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric the second from the restraint of fear and perhaps of honour he violated his recent treaty with the Romans and the ample territory of Narbonne which he firmly united to  his dominions became the immediate reward of his perfidy The selfish policy of Ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius his rival but the active count by the defence of Arles and the victory of Orleans saved Gaul and checked during his lifetime the progress of the Visigoths Their ambition was soon rekindled and the design of extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived and almost completed in the reign of Euric who assassinated his brother Theodoric and displayed with a more savage temper superior abilities both in peace and war He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army subdued the cities of Saragossa and Pampeluna vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the Tarragonese province carried his victorious arms into the heart of Lusitania and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain  See Mariana Hist Hispan tom i l v c p  The efforts of Euric were not less vigorous or less successful in Gaul and throughout the country that extends from the Pyrenees to the Rhône and the Loire Berry and Auvergne were the only cities or dioceses which refused to acknowledge him as their master  An imperfect but original picture of Gaul more especially of Auvergne is shewn by Sidonius who as a senator and afterwards as a bishop was deeply interested in the fate of his country See l v epist c  In the defence of Clermont their principal town the inhabitants of Auvergne sustained with inflexible resolution the miseries of  war pestilence and famine and the Visigoths relinquishing the fruitless siege suspended the hopes of that important conquest The youth of the province were animated by the heroic and almost incredible valour of Ecdicius the son of the emperor Avitus  Sidonius l iii epist p Greg Turon l ii c in tom ii p Jornandes c p Perhaps Ecdicius was only the soninlaw of Avitus his wife's son by another husband  who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen boldly attacked the Gothic army and after maintaining a flying skirmish retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont His charity was equal to his courage in a time of extreme scarcity four thousand poor were fed at his expence and his private influence levied an army of Burgundians for the deliverance of Auvergne From  his  virtues alone the faithful citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom and even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of their country since they were anxious to learn from his authority and example whether they should prefer the alternative of exile or servitude  Si nullae a republicâ vires nulla praesidia si nullae quantum rumor est Anthemii principis opes statuit te auctore nobilitas seu patriam dimittere seu capillos Sidon l ii epist p The last words Sirmond Not p may likewise denote the clerical tonsure which was indeed the choice of Sidonius himself  The public confidence was lost the resources of the state were exhausted and

the service of  twelve thousand British auxiliaries Riothamus one of the independent kings or chieftains of the island was persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul he sailed up the

trial and condemnation of Arvandus the Praetorian praefect Sidonius who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist a statecriminal has expressed with tenderness and freedom the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend  See Sidonius l i epist p with Sirmond's notes This letter does honour to his heart as well as to his understanding The prose of Sidonius however vitiated by a false and affected taste is much superior to his insipid verses  From the perils which he had escaped Arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom and such was the various though uniform imprudence of his behaviour that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfal The second praefecture which he obtained within the term of five years abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration His easy  temper was corrupted by flattery and exasperated by opposition he was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the province his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred The mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate and he passed the sea of Tuscany with a favourable wind the presage as he vainly imagined of his future fortunes A decent respect was still observed for the  Praefectorian  rank and on his arrival at Rome Arvandus was committed to the hospitality rather than to the custody of Flavius Asellus the count of the sacred largesses who resided in the Capitol  When the Capitol ceased to be a temple it was appropriated to the use of the civil magistrate and it is still the residence of the Roman senator The jewellers c might be allowed to expose their precious wares in the porticoes  He was eagerly pursued by his accusers the four deputies of Gaul who were all distinguished by their birth their dignities or their eloquence In the name of a great province and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence they instituted a civil and criminal action requiring such a restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state Their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had intercepted and which they could prove by the evidence of his secretary to have been dictated  by Arvandus himself The author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the  Greek  emperor he suggested the attack of the Britons on the Loire and he recommended a division of Gaul according to the law of nations between the Visigoths and the Burgundians  Haec ad regem Gothorum charta videbatur emitti pacem cum Graeco Imperatore dissuadens Britannos super Ligerim sitos impugnari opportere demonstrans cum Burgundionibus jure gentium Gallias dividi debere confirmans  These pernicious schemes which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation and the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons till the decisive moment of the contest But their intentions were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius He immediately apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger and sincerely lamented without any mixture of anger the haughty presumption of Arvandus who rejected and even resented the salutary advice of his friends Ignorant of his real situation Arvandus shewed himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service examined the shops of the merchants the silks and gems sometimes with the indifference of a spectator and sometimes with the attention of a purchaser and complained of the times of the senate of the prince and of the delays of justice His complaints were soon removed  An early day was fixed for his trial and Arvandus appeared with his accusers before a numerous assembly of the Roman senate The mournful garb which they affected excited the compassion of the judges who were scandalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary and when the praefect Arvandus with the first of the Gallic deputies were directed to take their places on the senatorial benches the same contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behaviour In this memorable judgment which presented a lively image of the old republic the Gauls exposed with force and freedom the grievances of the province and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently inflamed they recited the fatal epistle The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange supposition that a subject could not be convicted of treason unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple As the paper was read he repeatedly and with a loud voice acknowledged it for his genuine composition and his astonishment was equal to his dismay when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital offence By their decree he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison After a fortnight's adjournment the senate was again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death but while he expected in the island of Aesculapius the expiration  of the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors  Senatûsconsultum Tiberianum  Sirmond Not p but that law allowed only ten days between the sentence and execution the remaining twenty were added in the reign of Theodosius  his friends interposed the emperor Anthemius relented and the praefect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and confiscation The faults of Arvandus might deserve compassion but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice of the republic till he was condemned and executed on the complaint of the people of Auvergne That flagitious minister the Catiline of his age and country held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths to betray the province which he oppressed his industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences and his extravagant vices would have inspired contempt if they had not excited fear and abhorrence  Catilina seculi nostri Sidonius l ii epist p l v epist p l vii epist p He execrates the crimes and applauds the punishment of Seronatus perhaps with the indignation of a virtuous citizen perhaps with the resentment of a personal enemy    Such criminals were not beyond the reach of  Discord of Anthemius and Ricimer A D  justice but whatever might be the guilt of Ricimer that powerful Barbarian was able to contend or to negociate with the prince whose alliance he had condescended to accept The peaceful and prosperous reign which Anthemius had promised to the West was soon clouded by misfortune and discord Ricimer apprehensive or impatient of a superior retired from Rome  and fixed his residence at Milan an advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike tribes that were seated between the Alps and the Danube  Ricimer under the reign of Anthemius defeated and slew in battle Beorgor king of the Alani Jornandes c p His sister had married the king of the Burgundians and he maintained an intimate connection with the Suevic colony established in Pannonia and Noricum  Italy was gradually divided into two independent and hostile kingdoms and the nobles of Liguria who trembled at the near approach of a civil war fell prostrate at the feet of the patrician and conjured him to spare their unhappy country  "For my own part" replied Ricimer in a tone of insolent moderation "I am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the Galatian  Galatam concitatum Sirmond in his notes to Ennodius applies this appellation to Anthemius himself The emperor was probably born in the province of Galatia whose inhabitants the GalloGrecians were supposed to unite the vices of a savage and a corrupted people  but who will undertake to appease his anger or to mitigate the pride which always rises in proportion to our submission"  They informed him that Epiphanius bishop of Pavia  Epiphanius was thirty years bishop of Pavia A D see Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xvi p His name and actions would have been unknown to posterity if Ennodius one of his successors had not written his life Sirmond Opera tom i p in which he represents him as one of the greatest characters of the age  united the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove and appeared confident that the eloquence of such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition either of interest or passion Their  recommendation was approved and Epiphanius assuming the benevolent office of mediation proceeded without delay to Rome where he was received with the honours due to his merit and reputation The oration of a bishop in favour of peace may be easily supposed he argued that in all possible circumstances the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy or magnanimity or prudence and be seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce Barbarian which might be fatal to himself and must be ruinous to his dominions Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims but he deeply felt with grief and indignation the behaviour of Ricimer and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse  "What favours" he warmly exclaimed "have we refused to this ungrateful man What provocations have we not endured Regardless of the majesty of the purple I gave my daughter to a Goth I sacrificed my own blood to the safety of the republic The liberality which ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has exasperated him against his benefactor What wars has he not excited against the empire How often has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship Can I hope that  he  will respect the engagements of a treaty who has already violated the duties of a son"  But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius  and the bishop returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of Italy by a reconciliation  Ennodius p has related this embassy of Epiphanius and his narrative verbose and turgid as it must appear illustrates some curious passages in the fall of the Western empire  of which the sincerity and continuance might be reasonably suspected The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the throne of Anthemius The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reinforcement of Burgundians and Oriental Suevi he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor marched from Milan to the gates of Rome and fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius his Imperial candidate  The senator Olybrius of the Anician family  Olybrius emperor of the West A D March  might esteem himself the lawful heir of the Western empire He had married Placidia the younger daughter of Valentinian after she was restored by Genseric who still detained her sister Eudoxia as the wife or rather as the captive of his son The king of the Vandals supported by threats and solicitations the fair pretensions of his Roman ally and assigned as one of the motives of the war the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince and the unworthy preference which they had given to  a stranger  Priscus Excerpt Legation p Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p Eudoxia and her daughter were restored after the death of Majorian Perhaps the consulship of Olybrius A D was bestowed as a nuptial present  The friendship of the public enemy might render Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians but when Ricimer meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius he tempted with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an illustrious name and a royal alliance The husband of Placidia who like most of his ancestors had been invested with the consular dignity might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople nor does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied unless by the administration of an empire Yet Olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends perhaps of his wife rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a civil war and with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo accepted the Italian purple which was bestowed and resumed at the capricious will of a Barbarian He landed without obstacle for Genseric was master of the sea either at Ravenna or the port of Ostia and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer where he was received as the sovereign of the Western world  The hostile appearance of Olybrius is fixed notwithstanding the opinion of Pagi by the duration of his reign The secret connivance of Leo is acknowledged by Theophanes and the Paschal Chronicle We are ignorant of his motives but in this obscure period our ignorance extends to the most public and important facts    The patrician who had

Tyber from the rest of the city  Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided by Augustus only  one  the Janiculum lay on the Tuscan side of the Tyber But in the fifth century the Vatican suburb formed a considerable city and in the ecclesiastical distribution which had been recently made by Simplicius the reigning pope  two  of the  seven  regions or parishes of Rome depended on the church of St Peter See Nardini Roma Antica p It would require a tedious dissertation to mark the circumstances in which I am inclined to depart from the topography of that learned Roman  and it may be conjectured that an assembly of seceding senators imitated in the choice of Olybrius the forms of a legal election But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of Anthemius and the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him to prolong his reign and the public distress by a resistance of three months which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian or St Angelo and the narrow pass was defended with equal valour by the Goths till the death of Gilimer their leader The victorious troops breaking down every barrier rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the city and Rome if we may use the language of a contemporary Pope was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius

were indulged without controul in the licence of rapine and murder the crowd of slaves and plebeians who were unconcerned in the event could only gain by the indiscriminate pillage and the face of the city exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance  Such had been the saeva ac deformis urbe totâ facies when Rome was assaulted and stormed by the troops of Vespasian see

election of a new colleague was seriously agitated in the council of Leo The empress Verina studious to promote the greatness of her own family had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos who succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia a more solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept of Emperor of the West But the measures of the Byzantine court were so languid and irresolute that many months elapsed after the death of Anthemius and even of Olybrius before their destined successor could shew himself with a respectable force to his Italian subjects During that interval Glycerius an obscure soldier was invested with the purple by his patron Gundobald but the Burgundian prince was unable or unwilling to support his nomination by a civil war the pursuits of domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps  See Greg Turon l ii c in tom ii p Dubos Hist Critique tom i p By the murder or death of his two brothers Gundobald acquired the sole possession of the kingdom of Burgundy whose ruin was hastened by their discord  and his client was permitted  to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of Salona After extinguishing such a competitor the emperor Nepos was acknowledged by the senate by the Italians and by the provincials of Gaul his moral virtues and military talents were loudly celebrated and those who derived any private benefit from his government announced in prophetic strains the restoration of the public felicity  Julius Nepos armis pariter summus Augustus ac moribus Sidonius l v ep p Nepos had given to

discourse concealed the disgraceful secret which soon excited the just and bitter complaints of the bishop of Clermont  but his repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian confederates who under the command of Orestes their general were in full march from Rome to Ravenna Nepos trembled at their approach and instead of placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna he hastily escaped to his ships and retired to his Dalmatian principality on the opposite coast of the Hadriatic By this shameful abdication he protracted his life about five years in a very  ambiguous state between an emperor and an exile till he was assassinated at Salona by the ungrateful Glycerius who was translated perhaps as the reward of his crime to the archbishopric of Milan

empire is derived from Procopius de Bell Gothico l i e i p The popular opinion and the recent historians represent Odoacer in the false light of a  stranger  and a  king  who invaded Italy with an army of foreigners his native subjects  and in this promiscuous multitude the names of the Heruli the Scyrri the Alani the Turcilingi and the Rugians appear to have predominated The example of these warriors was imitated by Orestes  Orestes qui eo tempore quando Attila ad Italiam venit se illi junxit et ejus notarius factus fuerat Anonym Vales p He is mistaken in the date but we may credit his assertion that the secretary of Attila was the father of Augustulus  the son of Tatullus and the father of the last Roman emperor of the West Orestes who has been already mentioned in this history had never deserted his country His birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious subjects of  Pannonia When that province was ceded to the Huns he entered into the service of Attila his lawful sovereign obtained the office of his secretary and was repeatedly sent ambassador to Constantinople to represent the person and signify the commands of the imperious monarch The death of that conqueror restored him to his freedom and Orestes might honourably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert or to obey the Ostrogoths who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia He preferred the service of the Italian princes the successors of Valentinian and as he possessed the qualifications of courage industry and experience he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession till he was elevated by the favour of Nepos himself to the dignities of patrician and mastergeneral of the troops These troops had been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of Orestes who affected their manners conversed with them in their own language and was intimately connected with their national chieftains by long habits of familiarity and friendship At his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek who presumed to claim their obedience and when Orestes from some secret motive declined the purple they consented with the same facility to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the West By the abdication of Nepos Orestes had now attained the  His son Augustulus the last emperor of the West A D  summit of his ambitious hopes but he soon discovered before the end of the first year that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude which a rebel  must inculcate will be retorted against himself and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was only permitted to chuse whether he would be the slave or the victim of his Barbarian mercenaries The dangerous alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of Roman freedom and dignity At each revolution their pay and privileges were augmented but their insolence increased in a still more extravagant degree they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul Spain and Africa whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance and they insisted on their peremptory demand that a  third  part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them Orestes with a spirit which in another situation might be entitled to our esteem chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed multitude than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people He rejected the audacious demand and his refusal was favourable to the ambition of Odoacer a bold Barbarian who assured his fellowsoldiers that if they dared to associate under his command they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions From all the camps and garrisons of Italy the confederates actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader and the unfortunate patrician overwhelmed by the torrent hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites Pavia was immediately besieged  the fortifications were stormed the town was pillaged and although the bishop might labour with much zeal and some success to save the property of the church and the chastity of female captives the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes  See Ennodius in Vit Epiphan Sirmond tom i p He adds weight to the narrative of Prooopius though we may doubt whether the devil actually contrived the siege of Pavia to distress the bishop and his flock  His brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna and the helpless Augustulus who could no longer command the respect was reduced to implore the clemency of Odoacer  That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon  Odoacer king of Italy A D  who in some remarkable transactions particularly described in a preceding chapter had been the colleague of Orestes himself The honour of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance his rank was eminent and conspicuous he enjoyed the favour of Attila and the troops under his command who guarded in their turn the royal village consisted in a tribe of Scyrri his immediate and hereditary subjects In the revolt of the nations they still adhered to the Huns and more than twelve years afterwards

Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom viii p has clearly explained the origin and adventures of Odoacer I am almost inclined to believe that he was the same who pillaged Angers and commanded a fleet of Saxon pirates on the ocean Greg Turon l ii c in tom ii p  Their gallant leader who did not survive this national calamity left two sons Onulf and Odoacer to struggle with adversity and to maintain as they might by rapine or service the faithful followers of their exile Onulf directed his steps towards Constantinople where he sullied by the assassination of a generous benefactor the fame which he had acquired in arms His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among the Barbarians of Noricum with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate adventures and when he had fixed his choice he piously visited the cell of Severinus the popular saint of the country to solicit his approbation and blessing The lowness of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer he was obliged to stoop but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness and addressing him in a prophetic tone  "Pursue" said he "your design proceed to Italy you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind  Vade ad Italiam vade vilissimis nunc pellibus coopertis sed multis cito plurima largiturus Anonym

Eccles tom xvi p  "  The Barbarian whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction was admitted into the service of the Western empire and soon obtained an honourable rank in the guards His manners were gradually polished his military skill was improved and the confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their general unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high opinion of his courage and capacity  Theophanes who calls him a Goth affirms that he was educated nursed  in Italy p and as this strong expression will not bear a literal interpretation it must be explained by long service in the Imperial guards  Their military acclamations saluted him with the title of king but he abstained during his whole reign from the use of the purple and diadem  Nomen regis Odoacer assumpsit cum tamen neque purpurâ nec regalibus uteretur insignibus Cassiodor in Chron A D He seems to have assumed the abstract title of a king without applying it to any particular nation or

as the vicegerent of the emperor of the West But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office and such is the weight of antique prejudice that it required some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the enterprise The unfortunate Augustulus was made the instrument of  his own disgrace he signified his resignation to the senate and that assembly in their last act of obedience to a Roman prince still affected the spirit of freedom and the forms of the constitution An epistle was addressed by their unanimous decree to the emperor Zeno the soninlaw and successor of Leo who had lately been restored after a short rebellion to the Byzantine throne They solemnly  "disclaim the necessity or even the wish of continuing any longer the Imperial succession in Italy since in their opinion the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect at the same time both the East and the West In their own name and in the name of the people they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to Constantinople and they basely renounce the right of chusing their master the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which had given laws to the world The republic they repeat that name without a blush might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of Odoacer and they humbly request that the emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician and the administration of the  diocese  of Italy"  The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some marks of displeasure and indignation and when they were admitted to the audience of Zeno he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the two emperors Anthemius and Nepos whom the East had successively granted to the prayers of Italy  "The first" continued he "you have murdered the second you have expelled but the second is still alive and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign"  But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague His vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor and by the statues erected to his honour in the several quarters of Rome he entertained a friendly though ambiguous correspondence with the  patrician  Odoacer and he gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace which the Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the people  Malchus whose loss excites our regret has preserved in Excerpt Legat p this extraordinary embassy from the senate to Zeno The anonymous fragment p and the extract from Candidus apud Phot p are likewise of some use    In the space of twenty years since the death of  Augustulus is banished to the Lucullan villa  Valentinian nine emperors had successively disappeared and the son of Orestes a youth recommended only by his beauty would be the least entitled to the notice of posterity if his reign which was marked by the extinction of the Roman empire in the West did not leave a memorable Aera in the history of mankind  The precise year in which the Western empire was extinguished is not positively ascertained The vulgar aera of A D  appears  to have the sanction of authentic chronicles But the two dates assigned by Jornandes c p would delay that great event to the year and though M de Buat has overlooked  his  evidence he produces tom viii p many collateral circumstances in support of the same opinion  The patrician Orestes had married the daughter of Count  Romulus  of Petovio in Noricum the  name of  Augustus  notwithstanding the jealousy of power was known at Aquileia as a familiar surname and the appellations of the two great founders of the city and of the monarchy were thus strangely united in the last of their successors  See his medals in Ducange Fam Byzantin p Priscus Excerpt Legat p Maffei Osservazioni Letterarie tom ii p We may allege a famous and similar case The meanest subjects of the Roman empire assumed the  illustrious  name of  Patricius  which by the conversion of Ireland has been communicated to a whole nation  The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the names of Romulus Augustus but the first was corrupted into Momyllus by the Greeks and the second has been changed by the Latins into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus The life of this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer who dismissed him with his whole family from the Imperial palace fixed his annual allowance at six thousand pieces of gold and assigned the castle of Lucullus in Campania for the place of his exile or retirement  Ingrediens autem Ravennam deposuit Augustulum de regno cujus infantiam misertus concessit ei sanguinem et quia pulcher erat tamen donavit ei reditum sex

from the toils of the Punic war they were attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania and the countryhouse of the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting  model of their rustic simplicity  See the eloquent Declamation of Seneca epist lxxxvi The philosopher might have recollected that all luxury is relative and that the elder Scipio whose manners were polished by study and conversation was himself accused of that vice by his ruder contemporaries Livy xxix  The delicious shores of the bay of Naples were crowded with villas and Sylla applauded the masterly skill of his

reigned in  Decay of the Roman spirit  Italy over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind The disgrace of the Romans still excites our respectful compassion and we fondly sympathise with the imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued the proud consciousness of freedom and glory In the age of Roman virtue the provinces were subject to the arms and the citizens to the laws of the republic till those laws were subverted by civil discord and both  the city and the provinces became the servile property of a tyrant The forms of the constitution which alleviated or disguised their abject slavery were abolished by time and violence the Italians alternately lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereigns whom they detested or despised and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils of military licence capricious despotism and elaborate oppression During the same period the Barbarians had emerged from obscurity and contempt and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were introduced into the provinces as the servants the allies and at length the masters of the Romans whom they insulted or protected The hatred of the people was suppressed by fear they respected the spirit and splendour of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honours of the empire and the fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable strangers The stern Ricimer who trampled on the ruins of Italy had exercised the power without assuming the title of a king and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors  The King of Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valour and fortune had exalted  Character and reign of Odoacer A D  him his savage manners were polished by the habits of conversation and he respected though a conqueror and a Barbarian the institutions and even the prejudices of his subjects  After an interval of seven years Odoacer restored the consulship of the West For himself he modestly or proudly declined an honour which was still accepted by the emperors of the East but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of the most illustrious senators  The consular Fasti may be found in Pagi or Muratori The consuls named by Odoacer or perhaps by the Roman senate appear to have been acknowledged in the Eastern empire  and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius whose virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius his client  Sidonius Apollinaris l i epist p edit Sirmond has compared the two leading senators of his time A D Gennadius Avienus and Caecina Basilius To the former he assigns the specious to the latter the solid virtues of public and private life A Basilius junior possibly his son was consul in the year  The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced and the civil administration of Italy was still exercised by the Praetorian praefect and his subordinate officers Odoacer devolved on the Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public revenue but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and popular indulgence  Epiphanius interceded for the people of Pavia and the king first granted an indulgence of five years and afterwards relieved them from the oppression of Pelagius the Praetorian praefect Ennodius in Vit St Epiphan in Sirmond Oper tom i p  Like the rest of the Barbarians he had been instructed in the Arian heresy but he revered the monastic and episcopal characters and the silence of the Catholics attests the toleration which they enjoyed The peace of the  city required the interposition of his praefect Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for the benefit of the people whose devotion would have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church  See Baronius Annal Eccles A D No Sixteen years afterwards the irregular proceedings of Basilius were condemned by pope Symmachus in a Roman synod  Italy was protected by the arms of its conqueror and its frontiers were respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany who had so long insulted the feeble race of Theodosius Odoacer passed the Hadriatic to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos and to acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia He passed the Alps to rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava or Feletheus king of the Rugians who held his residence beyond the Danube The king was vanquished in battle and led away prisoner a numerous colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into Italy and Rome after a long period of defeat and disgrace

Notwithstanding the prudence and success of  Miserable state of Italy  Odoacer his kingdom exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation Since the age of Tiberius the decay of agriculture had been felt  in Italy and it was a just subject of complaint that the life of the Roman people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves  Tacit Annal iii The Recherches sur l'Administration des Terres chez les Romains p clearly state the progress of internal decay  In the division and the decline of the empire the tributary harvests of Egypt and Africa were withdrawn the numbers of the inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war famine  A famine which afflicted Italy at the time of the irruption of

Injuries were aggravated by insults the sense of actual sufferings was embittered by the fear of more dreadful evils and as new lands were allotted to new swarms of Barbarians each senator was apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his favourite villa or his most profitable farm The least unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist Since they desired to live they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their lives and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift  Such are the topics of consolation or rather of patience which Cicero ad Familiares l ix epist suggests to his friend Papirius Paetus under the military despotism of Caesar The argument however of "vivere pulcherrimum duxi" is more forcibly addressed to a Roman philosopher who possessed the free alternative of life or death  The distress of Italy was mitigated by the prudence and humanity of Odoacer who had bound himself at the price of his elevation to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent multitude The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted deposed or murdered by their  native  subjects and the various bands of Italian mercenaries who associated under the standard of an elective general claimed a larger  privilege of freedom and rapine A monarchy destitute of national union and hereditary right hastened to its dissolution After a reign of fourteen years Odoacer was oppressed by the superior genius of Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of government who restored an age of peace and prosperity and whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind  CHAP

corruption of Christianity I have purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events interesting in the study of human nature and important in the decline and fall of the Roman empire I The institution of the monastic life  The origin of the monastic institution has been laboriously discussed by Thomasin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i p and Helyot Hist des Ordres Monastiques tom i p These authors are very learned and tolerably honest and their difference of opinion shews the subject in its full extent Yet the cautious Protestant who distrusts  any  popish guides may consult the seventh

Demonstrat Evangel l i p edit Graec Rob Stephani Paris In his Ecclesiastical History published twelve years after the Demonstration Eusebius l ii c asserts the Christianity of the Therapeutae but he appears ignorant that a similar institution was actually revived in Egypt    I THE MONASTIC LIFE Origin of the monks  The loose and imperfect practice of religion satisfied  the conscience of the multitude The prince or magistrate the soldier or merchant reconciled their fervent zeal and implicit faith with the exercise of their profession the pursuit of their interest and the indulgence of their passions but the Ascetics who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of the gospel were inspired by the savage enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal and God as a tyrant They seriously renounced the business and the pleasures of the age abjured the use of wine of flesh and of marriage chastised their body mortified their affections and embraced a life of misery as the price of eternal happiness In the reign of Constantine the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate world to perpetual solitude or religious society Like the first Christians of Jerusalem  Cassian Collat xviii claims this origin for the institution of the  Coenobites  which gradually decayed till it was restored by Anthony and his disciples  they resigned the use or the property of their temporal possessions established regular communities of the same sex and a similar disposition and assumed the names of  Hermits Monks  and  Anachorets  expressive of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert They soon acquired the respect of the world which they despised and the loudest applause was bestowed on this DIVINE PHILOSOPHY  These are the expressive words of Sozomen who copiously and agreeably describes l i c the origin and progress of this monkish philosophy see Suicer Thesaur Eccles tom ii p Some modern writers Lipsius tom iv p Manuduct ad Philos Stoic iii and La Mothe le Vayer tom ix de la Vertû des Payens p have compared the Carmelites to the Pythagoreans and the Cynics to the Capucins  which surpassed  without the aid of science or reason the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools The monks might indeed contend with the Stoics in the contempt of fortune of pain and of death the Pythagorean silence and submission were revived in their servile discipline and they disdained as firmly as the Cynics themselves all the forms and decencies of civil society But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a purer and more perfect model They trod in the footsteps of the prophets who had retired to the desert  The Carmelites derive their pedigree in regular succession from the prophet Elijah see the Theses of Beziers A D in

consecrated the fantastic garments of the monks  Cassian has simply though copiously described the monastic habit of Egypt Institut l i to which Sozomen l iii c attributes such allegorical meaning and virtue  but their apparent singularity sometimes proceeds from  Their dress and habitations  their uniform attachment to a simple and primitive model which the revolutions of fashion have made ridiculous in the eyes of mankind The father of the Benedictines expressly disclaims all idea of choice or merit and soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of the countries which they may inhabit  Regul Benedict No in Cod Regul part ii p  The monastic habits of the ancients varied with the climate and their mode of life and they assumed with the same indifference the sheepskin of the Egyptian peasants or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers They allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt where it was a cheap and domestic manufacture but in the West they rejected such an expensive article of foreign luxury  See the Rule of Ferreolus bishop of Usez No in Cod Regul part ii p and of Isidore bishop of Seville No in Cod Regul part ii p  It was the practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair they wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the sight of profane objects their legs and feet were naked except in the extreme cold of winter and their slow and feeble steps were supported by a long staff The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and disgusting every sensation that  is offensive to man was thought acceptable to God and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water and of anointing them with oil  Some partial indulgences were granted for the hands and seet  "Totum

rough blanket and the same bundle of palmleaves served them as a seat in the day and a pillow in the night Their original cells were low narrow huts built of the slightest materials which formed by the regular distribution of the streets a large and populous village inclosing within the common wall a church an hospital perhaps a library some necessary offices a garden and a fountain or reservoir

St Jerom in strong but indiscreet language expresses the most important use of fasting and abstinence  "Non quod Deus universitatis Creator et Dominus intestinorum nostrorum rugitû et inanitate

Illusionibus Nocturnis  The rules of abstinence  which they imposed or practised were not uniform or perpetual the cheerful festival of the Pentecost was balanced by the extraordinary mortification of Lent the fervour of new monasteries was insensibly relaxed and the voracious appetite of the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of the Egyptians  Edacitas in Graecis gula est in Gallis natura Dialog i c p Cassian fairly owns that the perfect model of abstinence cannot be imitated in Gaul on account of the acrum temperies and the qualitas nostrae fragilitatis Institut iv Among the wastern rules that of Columbanus is the most austere he had been educated amidst the poverty of Ireland as rigid perhaps and ininflexible as the abstemious virtue of Egypt The Rule of Isidore of Seville is the mildest on holidays he allows the use of flesh  The disciples of Anthony and Pachomius were satisfied with their daily pittance  "Those who drink only water and have no nutritious liquor ought at least to have a pound and a half  twentyfour ounces  of bread every day"  State of Prisons p by Mr Howard  of twelve ounces of bread or rather biscuit  See Cassian Collat l ii The small loaves or biscuit of six ounces each had obtained the name of  Paximacia  Rosweyde Onomasticon p Pachomius however allowed his monks some latitude in the quantity of their food but he made them work in proportion as they eat Pallad in Hist Lausiac c in Vit Patrum l viii p  which they divided into two frugal repasts of the afternoon and of the evening It was esteemed a merit and almost a duty to abstain from the boiled vegetables which were provided for the refectory but the extraordinary bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of cheese fruit sallad and the small dried fish of the Nile  See the banquet to which Cassian Collation viii was invited by Serenus an Egyptian abbot  A more ample latitude  of sea and river fish was gradually allowed or assumed but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or travellers and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid monasteries of Europe a singular distinction was introduced as if birds whether wild or domestic had been less profane than the grosser animals of the field Water was the pure and innocent beveridge of the primitive monks and the founder of the Benedictines regrets the daily portion of half a pint of wine which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age  See the Rule of St Benedict No in Cod Reg part ii p Licet legamus vinum omnino monachorum non esse sed quia nostris temporibus id monachis persuaderi non potest he allows them a Roman  hemina  a measure which may be ascertained from Arbuthnot's Tables  Such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyards of Italy and his victorious disciples who passed the Alps the Rhine and the Baltic required in the place of wine an adequate compensation of strong beer or cyder  The candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty abjured at his first entrance  Their manual labour  into a regular community the idea and even the name of all separate or exclusive possession  Such expressions as  my  book  my  cloak  my

Monastiques  who laughs at the foolish nicety of modern convents seems ignorant that the ancients were equally absurd  The brethren were supported by their manual labour and the duty of labour was  strenuously recommended as a pennance as an exercise and as the most laudable means of securing their daily subsistence  Two great masters of ecclesiastical science the P Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom iii p and the P Mabillon Etudes Monastiques tom i p have seriously examined the manual labour of the monks which the former considers as a  merit  and the latter as a  duty  The garden and fields which the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or the morass were diligently cultivated by their hands They performed without reluctance the menial offices of slaves and domestics and the several trades that were necessary to provide their habits their utensils and their lodging were exercised within the precincts of the great monasteries The monastic studies have tended for the most part to darken rather than to dispel the cloud of superstition Yet the curiosity or zeal of some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical and even the profane sciences and posterity must gratefully acknowledge that the monuments of Greek and Roman literature have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens  Mabillon Etudes Monastiques tom i p has collected many curious facts to justify the literary labours of his predecessors both in the East and West Books were copied in the ancient monasteries of Egypt Cassian Institut l iv c and by the disciples of St Martin Sulp Sever in Vit Martin c p Cassiodorius has allowed an ample scope for the studies of the monks and  we  shall not be scandalized if their pen sometimes wandered from Chrysostom and Augustin to Homer and Virgil  But the more humble industry of the monks especially in Egypt was contented with the silent sedentary  occupation of making wooden sandals or of twisting the leaves of the palmtree into mats and baskets The superfluous stock which was not consumed in domestic use supplied by trade the wants of the community the boats of Tabenne and the other monasteries of Thebais descended the Nile as far as Alexandria and in a Christian market the sanctity of the workmen might enhance the intrinsic value of the work  But the necessity of manual labour was insensibly  Their riches  superseded The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints in whose society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life and the pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to receive for their use any future accessions of legacy or inheritance  Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom iii p has examined the revolution of the civil canon and common law Modern France confirms the death which monks have inflicted on themselves and justly deprives them of all right of inheritance  Melania contributed her plate three hundred pounds weight of silver and Paula contracted an immense debt for the relief of their favourite monks who kindly imparted the merits of their prayers and pennance to a rich and liberal sinner  See Jerom tom i p The monk Pambo made a sublime answer to Melania who wished to specify the value of her gift  "Do you offer it to me or to God If to God HE who suspends the mountains in a balance need not be informed of the weight of your plate"  Pallad Hist Lausiac c in the Vit Patrum l viii p  Time continually increased and accidents could seldom diminish the estates of the popular monasteries which spread over the adjacent  country and cities and in the first century of their institution the infidel Zosimus has maliciously observed that for the benefit of the poor the Christian monks had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary  To  Zosim l v p Yet the wealth of the Eastern monks was far surpassed by the princely greatness of the Benedictines  As long as they maintained their original fervour they approved themselves however the faithful and benevolent stewards of the charity which was entrusted to their care But their discipline was corrupted by prosperity they gradually assumed the pride of wealth and at last indulged the luxury of expence Their public luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an immortal society But every age of the church has accused the licentiousness of the degenerate monks who no longer remembered the object of their institution embraced the vain and sensual pleasures of the world which they had renounced  The sixth general council the Quinisext in Trullo Canon xlvii in Beveridge tom i p restrains women from passing the night in a male or men in a female monastery The seventh general council the second Nicene Canon xx in Beveridge tom i p prohibits the erection of double or promiscuous monasteries of both sexes but it appears from Balsamon that the prohibition was not effectual On the irregular pleasures and expences of the clergy and  monks  see Thomassin tom iii p  and scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the austere virtues of their founders  I have somewhere heard or read the frank confession of a Benedictine abbot  "My vow of poverty has given me an hundred thousand crowns a year my vow of obedience has raised me to the rank of a sovereign prince"  I forget the consequences of his vow of chastity    Their natural descent from such painful and dangerous virtue to the common vices of humanity will not perhaps excite much grief or indignation in the mind of a philosopher  The lives of the primitive monks were consumed  Their solitude  in pennance and solitude undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the time and exercise the faculties of reasonable active and social beings Whenever they were permitted to step beyond the precincts of the monastery two jealous companions were the mutual guards and spies of each other's actions and after their return they were condemned to forget or at least to suppress whatever they had seen or heard in the world Strangers who professed the orthodox faith were hospitably entertained in a separate apartment but their dangerous conversation was restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and fidelity Except in their presence the monastic slave might not receive the visits of his friends or kindred and it was deemed highly meritorious if he afflicted a tender sister or an aged parent by the obstinate refusal of a word or look  Pior an Egyptian monk allowed his sister to see him but he shut his eyes during the whole visit See Vit Patrum l iii p Many such examples might be added  The monks themselves passed their lives without personal  attachments among a crowd which had been formed by accident and was detained in the same prison by force or prejudice Recluse fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate a special licence of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their familiar visits and at their silent meals they were enveloped in their cowls inaccessible and almost invisible to each other  The th th th th st th th th th and th articles of the Rule of Pachomius impose most intolerable  laws  of silence and mortification  Study is the resource of solitude but education had not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics and peasants who filled the monastic communities They might work but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to disdain the exercise of manual labour and the industry must be faint and languid which is not excited by the sense of personal interest  According to their faith and zeal they might  Their devotion and visions  employ the day which they passed in their cells either in vocal or mental prayer they assembled in the evening and they were awakened in the night for the public worship of the monastery The precise moment was determined by the stars which are seldom clouded in the serene sky of Egypt and a rustic horn or trumpet the signal of devotion twice interrupted the vast silence of the desert  The diurnal and nocturnal prayers of the monks are copiously discussed by Cassian in the third and fourth books of his Institutions and he constantly prefers the liturgy which an angel had dictated to the monasteries of Tabenne  Even sleep the last refuge of  the unhappy was rigorously measured the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled along without business or pleasure and before the close of each day he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the Sun  Cassian from his own experience describes the  acedia  or listlessness of mind and body to which a monk was exposed when he sighed to find himself alone Saepiusque egreditur et ingreditur cellam et Solem velut ad occasum tardius properantem crebrius intuetur Institut x  In this comfortless state superstition still pursued and tormented her wretched votaries  The temptations and sufferings of Stagirius were communicated by that unfortunate youth to his friend St Chrysostom See Middleton's Works vol i p Something similar introduces the life of every saint and the famous Inigo or Ignatius the founder of the Jesuits Vie d'Inigo de Guiposcoa tom i p may serve as a memorable example  The repose which they had sought in the cloister was disturbed by tardy repentance profane doubts and guilty desires and while they considered each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin they perpetually trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss From the painful struggles of disease and despair these unhappy victims were sometimes relieved by madness or death and in the sixth century an hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion of the austere penitents who were deprived of their senses  Fleury Hist Ecclesiastique tom vii p I have read somewhere in the Vitae Patrum but I cannot recover the place that  several  I believe  many  of the monks who did not reveal their temptations to the abbot became guilty of suicide  Their visions before they attained this extreme and acknowledged term of frenzy have afforded ample materials of supernatural history It was their firm persuasion  that the air which they breathed was peopled with invisible enemies with innumerable daemons who watched every occasion and assumed every form to terrify and above all to tempt their unguarded virtue The imagination and even the senses were deceived by the illusions of distempered fanaticism and the hermit whose midnight prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber might easily confound the phantoms of horror or delight which had occupied his sleeping and his waking dreams  See the seventh and eighth Collations of Cassian who gravely examines why the daemons were grown less active and numerous since the time of St Antony Rosweyde's copious index to the Vitae Patrum will point out a variety of infernal scenes The devils were most formidable in a female shape    The monks were divided into two classes the  The Coenobites and Anachorets  Coenobites  who lived under a common and regular discipline and the  Anachorets  who indulged their unsocial independent fanaticism  For the distinction of the  Coenobites  and the  Hermits  especially in Egypt see Jerom tom i p ad Rusticum the first Dialogue of Sulpicius Severus Rufinus c in Vit Patrum l ii p Palladius c in Vit Patrum l viii p and above all the eighteenth and nineteenth Collations of Cassian These writers who compare the common and solitary life reveal the abuse and danger of the latter  The most devout or the most ambitious of the spiritual brethren renounced the convent as they had renounced the world The fervent monasteries of Egypt Palestine and Syria were surrounded by a  Laura  Suicer Thesaur Ecclesiast tom ii p Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i p gives a good account of these cells When Gerasimus founded his monastery in the wilderness of Jordan it was accompanied by a Laura of seventy cells  a distant circle of solitary cells and  the extravagant pennance of the Hermits was stimulated by applause and emulation  Theodoret in a large volume the Philotheus in Vit Patrum l ix p has collected the lives and miracles of thirty Anachorets Evagrius l i c more briefly celebrates the monks and hermits of Palestine  They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and chains and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars bracelets gauntlets and greaves of massy and rigid iron All superfluous incumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired whose naked bodies were only covered by their long hair They aspired to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the human brute is scarcely distinguished above his kindred animals and a numerous sect of Anachorets derived their name from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of Mesopotamia with the common herd  Sozomen l vi c The great St Ephrem composed a panegyric on these  or grazing monks Tillemont Mem Eccles tom viii p  They often usurped the den of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble they buried

circumference of two cubits or three feet which Evagrius assigns for the summit of the column is inconsistent with reason with facts and with the rules of architecture The people who saw it from below might be easily deceived  In this last and lofty station the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat of thirty summers and the cold of as many winters Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness and successively to assume the different postures of devotion He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude  with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet and a curious spectator after numbering twelve hundred and fortyfour repetitions at length desisted from the endless account The progress of an ulcer in his thigh  I must not conceal a piece of ancient scandal concerning the origin of this ulcer It has been reported that the Devil assuming an angelic form invited him to ascend like Elijah into a fiery chariot The saint too hastily raised his foot and Satan seized the moment of inflicting this chastisement on his vanity  might shorten but it could not disturb this  celestial  life and the patient Hermit expired without descending from his column A prince who should capriciously inflict such tortures would be deemed a tyrant but it would surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and body nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are susceptible of any lively affection for the rest of mankind A cruel unfeeling temper has distinguished the monks of every age and country their stern indifference which is seldom mollified by personal friendship is inflamed by religious hatred and their merciless zeal has strenuously administered the holy office of the Inquisition  The monastic saints who excite only the contempt and pity of a philosopher were respected  Miracles and worship of the monks  and almost adored by the prince and people  Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted the divine pillar of Simeon the tribes of Saracens disputed in arms the honour of his benediction the queens of Arabia and Persia gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue and the angelic Hermit was consulted by the younger Theodosius in the most important concerns of the church and state His remains were transported from the mountain of Telenissa by a solemn procession of the patriarch the mastergeneral of the East six bishops twentyone counts or tribunes and six thousand soldiers and Antioch revered his bones as her glorious ornament and impregnable defence The fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets the Christian world fell prostrate before their shrines and the miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded at least in number and duration the spiritual exploits of their lives But the golden legend of their lives  I know not how to select or specify the miracles contained in the  Vitae Patrum  of Rosweyde as the number very much exceeds the thousand pages of that voluminous work An elegant specimen may be found in the Dialogues of Sulpicius Severus and his life of St Martin He reveres the monks of Egypt yet he insults them with the remark that  they  never raised the dead whereas the bishop of Tours had restored  three  dead men to life  was embellished by the artful credulity of their interested brethren and a believing age was easily persuaded that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or a Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of the universe The favourites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate diseases with a touch a word or a distant  message and to expel the most obstinate daemons from the souls or bodies which they possessed They familiarly accosted or imperiously commanded the lions and serpents of the desert infused vegetation into a sapless trunk suspended iron on the surface of the water passed the Nile on the back of a crocodile and refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace These extravagant tales which display the fiction without the genius of poetry have seriously affected the reason the faith and the morals of the Christians Their  Superstition of the age  credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of the mind they corrupted the evidence of history and superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints every mysterious doctrine which they believed was fortified by the sanction of divine revelation and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks If it be possible to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of Cicero and the sacred legend of Theodoret between the character of Cato and that of Simeon we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was accomplished in the Roman empire within a period of five hundred years  II The progress of Christianity has been  II CONVERSION OF THE BARBARIANS  marked by two glorious and decisive victories over the learned and luxurious citizens of the Roman empire and over the warlike Barbarians of Scythia and Germany who subverted the empire and embraced the religion of the Romans The  Goths were the foremost of these savage proselytes and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a countryman or at least to a subject worthy to be ranked among the inventors of useful arts who have deserved the remembrance and gratitude of posterity A great number of Roman provincials had been led away into captivity by the Gothic bands who ravaged Asia in the time of Gallienus and of these captives many were Christians and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order Those involuntary missionaries dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia successively laboured for the salvation of their masters The seeds which they planted of the evangelic doctrine were gradually propagated and before the end of a century the pious work was atchieved by the labours of Ulphilas whose ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a small town of Cappadocia  Ulphilas the bishop and apostle of the Goths  On the subject of Ulphilas and the conversion of the Goths see Sozomen l vi c Socrates l iv c Theodoret l iv c Philostorg l ii c The heresy of Philostorgius appears to have given him superior means of information    Ulphilas apostle of the Goths A D c  acquired their love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal and they received with implicit confidence the doctrines of truth and virtue which he preached and practised He executed the arduous task of translating the Scriptures into their native tongue a dialect of the German or Teutonic language but he prudently suppressed the four books of Kings as they might tend to irritate the fierce and sanguinary  spirit of the Barbarians The rude imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds so illqualified to communicate any spiritual ideas was improved and modulated by his genius and Ulphilas before he could frame his version was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twentyfour letters four of which he invented to express the peculiar sounds that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation  A mutilated copy of the four Gospels in the Gothic version was published A D and is esteemed the most ancient monument of the Teutonic language though Wetstein attempts by some frivolous conjectures to deprive Ulphilas of the honour of the work Two of the four additional letters express the  W  and our own  Th  See Simon Hist Critique du Nouveau Testament tom ii p Mill Prolegom p edit Kuster Wetstein Prolegom tom i p  But the prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted by war and intestine discord and the chieftains were divided by religion as well as by interest Fritigern the friend of the Romans became the proselyte of Ulphilas while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire and of the Gospel The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which he excited A waggon bearing aloft the shapeless image of Thor perhaps or of Woden was conducted in solemn procession through the streets of the camp and the rebels who refused to worship the God of their fathers were immediately burnt with their tents and families The character of Ulphilas recommended him to the esteem of the Eastern court where he twice appeared as the minister of peace  he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths who implored the protection of Valens and the name of  Moses  was applied to this spiritual guide who conducted his people through the deep waters of the Danube to the Land of Promise  Philostorgius erroneously places this passage under the reign of Constantine but I am much inclined to believe that it preceded the great emigration  The devout shepherds who were attached to his person and tractable to his voice acquiesced in their settlement at the foot of the Maesian mountains in a country of woodlands and pastures which supported their flocks and herds and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces These harmless Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of Christianity  We are obliged to Jornandes de Reb Get c p for a short and lively picture of these lesser Goths Gothi Minores populus immensus cum suo Pontifice ipsoque primate Wulfila The last words if they are not mere tautology imply some temporal jurisdiction    Their fiercer brethren the formidable Visigoths  The Goths Vandals Burgundians c embrace Christianity A D c  universally adopted the religion of the Romans with whom they maintained a perpetual intercourse of war of friendship or of conquest In their long and victorious march from the Danube to the Atlantic ocean they converted their allies they educated the rising generation and the devotion which reigned in the camp of Alaric or the court of Thoulouse might edify or disgrace the palaces of Rome and Constantinople  At non ita Gothi non ita Vandali malis licet doctoribus instituti meliores tamen etiam in hâc parte quam nostri Salvian de Gubern Dei l vii p    During the same period Christianity was embraced by almost all the Barbarians who established their kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire the Burgundians in Gaul the Suevi in Spain the Vandals in Africa the Ostrogoths in Pannonia and the various bands of Mercenaries that raised Odoacer to the throne of Italy The Franks and the Saxons still persevered in the errors of Paganism but the Franks obtained the monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome These Barbarian profelytes displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith The Merovingian kings and their successors Charlemagne and the Othos extended by their laws and victories the dominion of the cross England produced the apostle of Germany and the evangelic light was gradually diffused from the neighbourhood of the Rhine to the nations of the Elbe the Vistula and the Baltic  Mosheim has slightly sketched the progress of Christianity in the North from the fourth to the fourteenth century The subject would afford materials for an ecclesiastical and even philosophical history    The different motives which influenced the  Motives of their faith  reason or the passions of the Barbarian converts cannot easily be ascertained They were often capricious and accidental a dream an omen the report of a miracle the example of some priest or hero the charms of a believing wife and above all the fortunate event of a prayer or vow  which in a moment of danger they had addressed to the God of the Christians  To such a cause has Socrates l vii c ascribed the conversion of the Burgundians whose Christian piety is celebrated by Orosius l vii c  The early prejudices of education were insensibly erazed by the habits of frequent and familiar society the moral precepts of the Gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the monks and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible power of relics and the pomp of religious worship But the rational and ingenious mode of persuasion which a Saxon bishop  See an original and curious epistle from Daniel the first bishop of Winchester Beda Hist Eccles Anglorum l v c p edit Smith to St Boniface who preached the Gospel among the Savages of Hesse and Thuringia Epistol Bonifacii lxvii in the Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum tom xiii p  suggested to a popular saint might sometimes be employed by the missionaries who laboured for the conversion of infidels  "Admit" says the sagacious disputant "whatever they are pleased to assert of the fabulous and carnal genealogy of their gods and gooddesses who are propagated from each other From this principle deduce their imperfect nature and human infirmities the assurance they were  born  and the probability that they will  die  At what time by what means from what cause were the eldest of the gods or goddesses produced Do they still continue or have they ceased to propagate If they have ceased summon your antagonists to declare the reason of this strange alteration If they still continue the number of the gods must  become infinite and shall we not risk by the indiscreet worship of some impotent deity to excite the resentment of his jealous superior The visible heavens and earth the whole system of the universe which may be conceived by the mind is it created or eternal If created how or where could the gods themselves exist before the creation If eternal how could they assume the empire of an independent and preexisting world Urge these arguments with temper and moderation insinuate at seasonable intervals the truth and beauty of the Christian revelation and endeavour to make the unbelievers ashamed without making them angry"  This metaphysical reasoning too refined perhaps for the Barbarians of Germany was fortified by the grosser weight of authority and popular consent The advantage of temporal prosperity had deserted the Pagan cause and passed over to the service of Christianity The Romans themselves the most powerful and enlightened nation of the globe had renounced their ancient superstition and if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse the efficacy of the new faith the disgrace was already retrieved by the conversion of the victorious Goths The valiant and fortunate Barbarians who subdued the provinces of the West successively received and reflected the same edifying example Before the age of Charlemagne the Christian nations of Europe might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate climates of the fertile lands which produced  corn wine and oil while the savage idolaters and their helpless idols were confined to the extremities of the earth the dark and frozen regions of the North  The sword of Charlemagne added weight to the argument but when Daniel wrote this epistle A D the Mahometans who reigned from India to Spain might have retorted it against the Christians    Christianity which opened the gates of Heaven  Effects of their conversion  to the Barbarians introduced an important change in their moral and political condition They received at the same time the use of letters so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book and while they studied the divine truth their minds were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history of nature of the arts and of society The version of the Scriptures into their native tongue which had facilitated their conversion must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read the original text to understand the sacred liturgy of the church and to examine in the writings of the fathers the chain of ecclesiastical tradition These spiritual gifts were preserved in the Greek and Latin languages which concealed the inestimable monuments of ancient learning The immortal productions of Virgil Cicero and Livy which were accessible to the Christian Barbarians maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of Augustus and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect state and the flame of science was secretly kept alive to warm and  enlighten the mature age of the Western world In the most corrupt state of Christianity the Barbarians might learn justice from the  law  and mercy from the  gospel  and if the knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions or to regulate their passions they were sometimes restrained by conscience and frequently punished by remorse But the direct authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion which united them with their Christian brethren in spiritual friendship The influence of these sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service or the alliance of the Romans to alleviate the horrors of war to moderate the insolence of conquest and to preserve in the downfall of the empire a permanent respect for the name and institutions of Rome In the days of Paganism the priests of Gaul and Germany reigned over the people and controuled the jurisdiction of the magistrates and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal or more ample measure of devout obedience to the pontiffs of the Christian faith The sacred character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions they obtained an honourable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and freemen and it was their interest as well as their duty to mollify by peaceful counsels the fierce spirit of the Barbarians The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy the frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem and the growing authority of the Popes cemented the union of the Christian republic and gradually produced the similar manners and common jurisprudence  which have distinguished from the rest of mankind the independent and even hostile nations of modern Europe  But the operation of these causes was checked  They are involved in the Arian heresy  and retarded by the unfortunate accident which infused a deadly poison into the cup of Salvation Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas his connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign of Arianism The apostle of the Goths subscribed the creed of Rimini professed with freedom and perhaps with sincerity that the SON was not equal or consubstantial to the FATHER  The opinions of Ulphilas and the Goths inclined to SemiArianism since they would not say that the Son was a  creature  though they held communion with those who maintained that heresy Their apostle represented the whole controversy as a question of trifling moment which had been raised by the passions of the clergy Theodoret l iv c  communicated these errors to the clergy and people and infected the Barbaric world with an heresy  The Arianism of the Goths has been imputed to the emperor Valens  "Itaque justo Dei judicio ipsi eum vivum incenderunt qui propter eum etiam mortui vitio erroris arsuri sunt"  Orosius l vii c p  This cruel sentence is confirmed by Tillemont Mem Eccless tom vi p who coolly observes  "un seul homme entraina dans l'enfer un nombre infini de Septentrionaux c"  Salvian de Gubern Dei l v p pities and excuses their involuntary error  which the great Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the Romans The temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted to metaphysical subtleties but they strenuously maintained what they had piously received as the pure and genuine doctrines of Christianity The advantage  of preaching and expounding the Scriptures in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labours of Ulphilas and his successors and they ordained a competent number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the kindred tribes The Ostrogoths the Burgundians the Suevi and the Vandals who had listened to the eloquence of the Latin clergy  Orosius affirms in the year l vii c p that the churches of Christ of the Catholics were filled with Huns Suevi Vandals Burgundians  preferred the more intelligible lessons of their domestic teachers and Arianism was adopted as the national faith of the warlike converts who were seated on the ruins of the Western empire This irreconcilable difference of religion was a perpetual source of jealousy and hatred and the reproach of  Barbarian  was embittered by the more odious epithet of  Heretic  The heroes of the North who had submitted with some reluctance to believe that all their ancestors were in hell  Radbod king of the Frisons was so much scandalized by this rash declaration of a missionary that he drew back his foot after he had entered the baptismal font See Fleury Hist Eccles tom ix p  were astonished and exasperated to learn that they themselves had only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation Instead of the smooth applause which Christian kings are accustomed to expect from their loyal prelates the orthodox bishops and their clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts and their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal and might sometimes be dangerous  The Epistles of Sidonius bishop of Clermont under the Visigoths and of Avitus bishop of Vienna under the Burgundians explain sometimes in dark hints the general dispositions of the Catholics The history of Clovis and Theodorie will suggest some particular facts  The pulpit  that safe and sacred organ of sedition resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes  Genseric confessed the resemblance by the severity with which he punished such indiscreet allusions Victor Vitensis p  the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a glorious deliverance and the seditious saints were tempted to promote the accomplishment of their own predictions Notwithstanding these provocations the Catholics of Gaul  General toleration  Spain and Italy enjoyed under the reign of the Arians the free and peaceful exercise of their religion Their haughty masters respected the zeal of a numerous people resolved to die at the foot of their altars and the example of their devout constancy was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves The conquerors evaded however the disgraceful reproach or confession of fear by attributing their toleration to the liberal motives of reason and humanity and while they affected the language they imperceptibly imbibed the spirit of genuine Christianity  The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted  Arian persecution of the Vandals  The Catholics were indiscreet the Barbarians were impatient and the partial acts of severity or injustice which had been recommended by the Arian clergy were exaggerated by the orthodox writers The guilt of persecution may be imputed to Euric king of the Visigoths who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical or at least of episcopal functions and punished the popular  bishops of Aquitain with imprisonment exile and confiscation  Such are the contemporary complaints of Sidonius bishop of Clermont l vii c p c edit Sirmond Gregory of Tours who quotes this Epistle l ii c in tom ii p extorts an unwarrantable assertion that of the nine vacancies in Aquitain some had been produced by episcopal  martyrdoms  But the cruel and absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was undertaken by the Vandals alone Genseric  Genseric A D  himself in his early youth had renounced the orthodox communion and the apostate could neither grant nor expect a sincere forgiveness He was exasperated to find that the Africans who had fled before him in the field still presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of compassion His Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant laws and arbitrary punishments The language of Genseric was furious and formidable the knowledge of his intentions might justify the most unfavourable interpretation of his actions and the Arians were reproached with the frequent executions which stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant Arms and ambition were however the ruling passions of the monarch of the sea But Hunneric his inglorious  Hunneric A D  son who seemed to inherit only his vices tormented the Catholics with the same unrelenting fury which had been fatal to his brother his nephews and the friends and favourites of his father and even to the Arian patriarch who was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage  The religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce persecution was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of Hunneric revenged the injuries without contributing to the deliverance of the church The throne of Africa was successively filled by the two nephews of Hunneric by Gundamund who reigned about twelve and by  Gundamund A D  Thrasimund who governed the nation above twentyseven years Their administration was hostile and oppressive to the orthodox party Gundamund appeared to emulate or even to surpass the cruelty of his uncle and if at length he relented if he recalled the bishops and restored the freedom of Athanasian worship a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency His brother Thrasimund was the greatest and most accomplished of the Vandal  Thrasimund A D  kings whom he excelled in beauty prudence and magnanimity of soul But this magnanimous character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency Instead of threats and tortures he employed the gentle but efficacious powers of seduction Wealth dignity and the royal favour were the liberal rewards of apostacy the Catholics who had violated the laws might purchase their pardon by the renunciation of their faith and whenever Thrasimund meditated any rigorous measure he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious opportunity Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death and he  exacted from his successor a solemn oath that he would never tolerate the sectaries of Athanasius But his successor Hilderic the gentle son of the savage Hunneric preferred the duties of  Hilderic A D  humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an impious oath and his accession was gloriously marked by the restoration of peace and universal freedom The throne of that virtuous though feeble monarch was usurped by his cousin Gelimer a zealous Arian but the Vandal kingdom  Gelimer A D  before he could enjoy or abuse his power was subverted by the arms of Belisarius and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which they had endured  The original monuments of the Vandal persecution are preserved in the five books of the History of Victor Vitensis de Persecutione Vandalicâ a bishop who was exiled by Hunneric in the Life of St Fulgentius who was distinguished in the persecution of Thrasimond in Biblioth Max Patrum tom ix p and in the first book of the Vandalic War by the impartial Procopius c p Dom Ruinart the last editor of Victor has illustrated the whole subject with a copious and learned apparatus of notes and supplement Paris    The passionate declamations of the Catholics  A general view of the persecution in Africa  the sole historians of this persecution cannot afford any distinct series of causes and events any impartial view of characters or counsels but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit or notice may be referred to the following heads I In the original law which is still extant  Victor iv p Hunneric refuses the name of Catholics to the  Homoousians  He describes as the veri Divinae Majestatis cultores his own party who professed the faith confirmed by more than a thousand bishops in the synods of Rimini and Seleucia  Hunneric expressly declares  and the declaration appears to be correct that he had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the Imperial edicts against the heretical congregations the clergy and the people who dissented from the established religion If the rights of conscience had been understood the Catholics must have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual sufferings But they still persisted to refuse the indulgence which they claimed While they trembled under the lash of persecution they praised the  laudable  severity of Hunneric himself who burnt or banished great numbers of Manichaeans  Victor ii p  Laudabilior  videbatur In the MSS which omit this word the passage is unintelligible See Ruinart Not p  and they rejected with horror the ignominious compromise that the disciples of Arius and of Athanasius should enjoy a reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the Romans and in those of the Vandals  Victor ii p The clergy of Carthage called these conditions  periculosae  and they seem indeed to have been proposed as a snare to entrap the Catholic bishops  II The practice of a conference which the Catholics had so frequently used to insult and punish their obstinate antagonists was retorted against themselves  See the narrative of this conference and the treatment of the bishops in Victor ii p and the whole fourth book p The third book p is entirely filled by their apology or confession of faith  At the command of Hunneric four hundred and sixtysix orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage but when they were admitted  into the hall of audience they had the mortification of beholding the Arian Cirila exalted on the patriarchal throne The disputants were separated after the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence of delay and precipitation of military force and of popular clamour One martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic bishops twentyeight escaped by flight and eightyeight by conformity fortysix were sent into Corsica to cut timber for the royal navy and three hundred and two were banished to the different parts of Africa exposed to the insults of their enemies and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual comforts of life  See the list of the African bishops in Victor p and Ruinart's notes p The schismatic name of  Donatus  frequently occurs and they appear to have adopted like our fanatics of the last age the pious appellations of  Deodatus Deogratias Quidvultdeus Habetdeum  c  The hardships of ten years exile must have reduced their numbers and if they had complied with the law of Thrasimund which prohibited any episcopal consecrations the orthodox church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its actual members They disobeyed and their disobedience was punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into Sardinia where they languished fifteen years till the accession of the gracious Hilderic  Fulgent Vit c Thrasimund affected the praise of moderation and learning and Fulgentius addressed three books of controversy to the Arian tyrant whom he styles  Jiissime Rex  Biblioth Maxim Patrum tom ix p Only sixty bishops are mentioned as exiles in the life of Fulgentius they are increased to one hundred and twenty by Victor Tunnunensis and Isidore but the number of two hundred and twenty is specified in the  Historia Miscella  and a short authentic chronicle of the times See Ruinart p  The two islands were judiciously  chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants Seneca from his own experience has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of Corsica  See the base and insipid epigrams of the Stoic who could not support exile with more fortitude than Ovid Corsica might not produce corn wine or oil but it could not be destitute of grass water and even fire  and the plenty of Sardinia was overbalanced by the unwholesome quality of the air  Si ob gravitatem coeli interissent  viie  damnum Tacit Annal ii In this application Thrasimund would have adopted the reading of some critics  utile  damnum  III The zeal of Genseric and his successors for the conversion of the Catholics must have rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the Vandal faith Before the churches were finally shut it was a crime to appear in a Barbarian dress and those who presumed to neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their long hair  See these preludes of a  general  persecution in Victor ii and the two edicts of Hunneric l ii p l iv p  The Palatine officers who refused to profess the religion of their prince were ignominiously stripped of their honours and employments banished to Sardinia and Sicily or condemned to the servile labours of slaves and peasants in the fields of Utica In the districts which had been peculiarly allotted to the Vandals the exercise of the Catholic worship was more strictly prohibited and severe penalties  were denounced against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte By these arts the faith of the Barbarians was preserved and their zeal was inflamed they discharged with devout fury the office of spies informers or executioners and whenever their cavalry took the field it was the favourite amusement of the march to defile the churches and to insult the clergy of the adverse faction  See Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c p A Moorish prince endeavoured to propitiate the God of the Christians by his diligence to eraze the marks of the Vandal sacrilege  IV The citizens who had been educated in the luxury of the Roman province were delivered with exquisite cruelty to the Moors of the desert A venerable train of bishops presbyters and deacons with a faithful crowd of four thousand and ninetysix persons whose guilt is not precisely ascertained were torn from their native homes by the command of Hunneric During the night they were confined like a herd of cattle amidst their own ordure during the day they pursued their march over the burning sands and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue they were goaded or dragged along till they expired in the hands of their tormentors  See this story in Victor ii p Victor describes the distress of these confessors as an eyewitness  These unhappy exiles when they reached the Moorish huts might excite the compassion of a people whose native humanity was neither improved by reason nor corrupted by fanaticism but if they escaped the dangers they were condemned to  share the distress of a savage life V It is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy as well as the crime of the offender The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge exposes his person to the severity of the law and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment Through the veil of fiction and declamation we may clearly perceive that the Catholics more especially under the reign of Hunneric endured the most cruel and ignominious treatment  See the fifth book of Victor His passionate complaints are confirmed by the sober testimony of Procopius and the public declaration of the emperor Justinian Cod l i tit xxvii  Respectable citizens noble matrons and consecrated virgins were stripped naked and raised in the air by pullies with a weight suspended at their feet In this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges or burnt in the most tender parts with redhot plates of iron The amputation of the ears the nose the tongue and the righthand was inflicted by the Arians and although the precise number cannot be defined it is evident that many persons among whom a bishop  Victor ii p  and a proconsul  Victor v p His name was Victorianus and he was a wealthy citizen of Adrumetum who enjoyed the confidence of the king by whose favour he had obtained the office or at least the title of proconsul of Africa  may be named  were entitled to the crown of martyrdom The same honour has been ascribed to the memory of count Sebastian who professed the Nicene creed with unshaken constancy and Genseric might detest as an heretic the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival  Victor i p After relating the firm resistance and dextrous reply of count Sebastian he adds quare alio generis argumento postea bellicosum virum occidit  VI A new mode of conversion which might subdue the feeble and alarm the timorous was employed by the Arian ministers They imposed by fraud or violence the rites of baptism and punished the apostacy of the Catholics if they disclaimed this odious and profane ceremony which scandalously violated the freedom of the will and the unity of the sacrament  Victor v Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p  The hostile sects had formerly allowed the validity of each other's baptism and the innovation so fiercely maintained by the Vandals can be imputed only to the example and advice of the Donatists VII The Arian clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard which they were so desirous to possess A patriarch  Primate  was more properly the title of the bishop of Carthage but the name of  patriarch  was given by the sects and nations to their principal ecclesiastic See Thomassin Discipline de l'Eglise tom i p  might seat himself on the throne of Carthage some bishops in the principal cities might usurp the place of their rivals but  the smallness of their numbers and their ignorance of the Latin language  The patriarch Cyrila himself publicly declared that he did not understand Latin Victor ii p Nescio Latine and he might converse with tolerable ease without being capable of disputing or preaching in that language His Vandal clergy were still more ignorant and small confidence could be placed in the Africans who had conformed  disqualified the Barbarians for the ecclesiastical ministry of a great church and the Africans after the loss of their orthodox pastors were deprived of the public exercise of Christianity VIII The emperors were the natural protectors of the Homoousian doctrine and the faithful people of Africa both as Romans and as Catholics preferred their lawful sovereignty to the usurpation of the Barbarous heretics During an interval of peace and friendship Hunneric restored the cathedral of Carthage at the intercession of Zeno who reigned in the East and of Placidia the daughter and relict of emperors and the sister of the queen of the Vandals  Victor ii p  But this decent regard was of short duration and the haughty tyrant displayed his contempt for the religion of the Empire by studiously arranging the bloody images of persecution in all the principal streets through which the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the palace  Victor v p He appeals to the ambassador himself whose name was Uranius  An oath was required from the bishops who were assembled at Carthage that they would support the succession of his son Hilderic and  that they would renounce all foreign or  transmarine  correspondence This engagement consistent as it should seem with their moral and religious duties was refused by the more sagacious members  Astutiores  Victor iv p He plainly intimates that their quotation of the Gospel "Non jurabitis in toto" was only meant to elude the obligation of an inconvenient oath The fortysix bishops who refused were banished to Corsica the three hundred and two who swore were distributed through the provinces of Africa  of the assembly Their refusal faintly coloured by the pretence that it is unlawful for a Christian to swear must provoke the suspicious of a jealous tyrant  The Catholics oppressed by royal and military  Catholic frauds  force were far superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning With the same weapons which the Greek  Fulgentius bishop of Ruspae in the Byzacene province was of a senatorial family and had received a liberal education He could repeat all Homer and Menander before he was allowed to study Latin his native tongue Vit Fulgent c Many African bishops might understand Greek and many Greek theologians were translated into Latin  and Latin fathers had already provided for the Arian controversy they repeatedly silenced or vanquished the fierce and illiterate successors of Ulphilas The consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of religious warfare Yet instead of assuming such honourable pride the orthodox theologians were tempted by the assurance of impunity to compose fictions which must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery They ascribed their own

exasperated the cruelty of Hunneric A military count was dispatched from Carthage to Tipasa he collected the Catholics in the Forum and in the presence of the whole province deprived  the guilty of their righthands and their tongues But the holy confessors continued to speak without tongues and this miracle is attested by Victor an African bishop who published an history of the persecution within two years after the event  Victor Vitensis v p Ruinart p    "If any one" says Victor "should doubt of the truth let him repair to Constantinople and listen to the clear and perfect language of Restitutus the subdeacon one of these glorious sufferers who is now lodged in the palace of the emperor Zeno and is respected by the devout empress"  At Constantinople we are astonished to find a cool a learned an unexceptionable witness without interest and without passion Aeneas of Gaza a Platonic philosopher has accurately described his own observations on these African sufferers  "I saw them myself I heard them speak I diligently enquired by what means such an articulate voice could be formed without any organ of speech I used my eyes to examine the report of my ears I opened their mouth and saw that the whole tongue had been completely torn away by the roots an operation which the physicians generally suppose to be mortal  Aeneas Gazaeus in Theophrasto in Biblioth Patrum tom viii p

all appeal to their personal knowledge or the public notoriety for the truth of a miracle which was repeated in several instances displayed on the greatest theatre of the world and submitted during a series of years to the calm examination of the senses This supernatural gift of the African confessors who spoke without tongues will command the assent of those and of those only who already believe

of Sigibert king of Austrasia and of the famous Brunechild The beauteous Ingundis who was no more than thirteen years of age was received beloved and persecuted in the Arian court of Toledo and her religious constancy was alternately assaulted with blandishments and violence by Goisvintha the Gothic queen who abused the double claim of maternal authority  Goisvintha successively married two kings of the Visigoths Athanigild to whom she bore Brunechild the mother of Ingundis and Leovigild whose two sons Hermenegild and Recared were the issue of a former marriage  Incensed by her resistance Goisvintha  seized the Catholic princess by her long hair inhumanly dashed her against the ground kicked her till she was covered with blood and at last gave orders that she should be

and he was gradually persuaded that Ingundis suffered for the cause of divine truth Her tender complaints and the weighty arguments of Leander archbishop of Seville accomplished his conversion and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith by the solemn rites of confirmation  The Catholics who admitted the baptism of heretics repeated the rite or as it was afterwards styled the sacrament of confirmation to which they ascribed many mystic and marvellous prerogatives both visible and invisible See Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p  The rash youth inflamed by zeal and perhaps by ambition was tempted to violate the duties of a son and a subject and the Catholics of Spain although they could not complain of persecution applauded his pious rebellion against an heretical father The civil war was protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida Cordova and Seville which had strenuously espoused the party of Hermenegild He invited the orthodox Barbarians the Suevi and  the Franks to the destruction of his native land he folicited the dangerous aid of the Romans who possessed Africa and a part of the Spanish coast and his holy ambassador the archbishop Leander effectually negociated in person with the Byzantine court But the hopes of the Catholics were crushed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded the troops and treasures of Spain and the guilty Hermenegild after his vain attempts to resist or to escape was compelled to surrender himself into the hands of an incensed father Leovigild was still mindful of that sacred character and the rebel despoiled of the regal ornaments was still permitted in a decent exile to profess the Catholic religion His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king and the sentence of death which he pronounced with apparent reluctance was privately executed in the tower of Seville The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the Arian communion as the price of his safety may excuse the honours that have been paid to the memory of St Hermenegild His wife and infant son were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity and this

salutary end Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles declared himself a Catholic and exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments would have excited an endless controversy and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments the testimony of Earth and of Heaven The  Earth  had submitted to the Nicene synod the Romans the Barbarians and the inhabitants of Spain unanimously professed the same orthodox creed and the Visigoths resisted almost alone the consent of the Christian world A superstitious age was prepared to reverence as the testimony of  Heaven  the preternatural cures which were performed by the skill

Gallicia  Ferreras tom ii p A D has illustrated the difficulties which regard the time and circumstances of the conversion of the Suevi They had been recently united by Leovigild to the Gothic monarchy of Spain  The Catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important change of the national religion A conspiracy secretly fomented by the queendowager was formed against his life and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul But Recared disarmed the conspirators defeated the rebels and executed severe justice which the Arians in their turn might brand with the reproach of persecution Eight bishops whose names betray their Barbaric origin abjured their errors and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes with the house in which they had been purposely collected The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion the faith at least of the rising generation was fervent and sincere and the devout liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain Seventy bishops assembled in the council of Toledo received the submission of their conquerors and the zeal of the Spaniards improved the Nicene creed by declaring the procession  of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as from the Father a weighty point of doctrine which produced long afterwards the schism of the

of France tom iv p and Wilkins Leges AngloSaxonicae p Siquis sacrificium immolaverit praeter Deo soli morte moriatur  But the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished among a Christian people the theological disputes of the schools were suspended by propitious ignorance and the intolerant spirit which could find neither idolaters nor heretics  was reduced to the persecution of the Jews That exiled nation had founded some synagogues in the cities of Gaul but Spain since the time of Hadrian was filled with their numerous colonies  The Jews pretend that they were introduced into Spain

tortured and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted to abandon their native country The excessive zeal of the Catholic king was moderated even by the clergy of Spain who solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence  that  the sacraments should not be forcibly imposed but  that  the Jews who had been baptized should be constrained for the honour of the church to persevere in the external practice  of a religion which they disbelieved and detested Their frequent relapses provoked one of the successors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions and a council of Toledo published a decree that every Gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims whom they delighted to torture or to deprive themselves of the industrious slaves over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression The Jews still continued in Spain under the weight of the civil and ecclesiastical laws which in the same country have been

subtle and loquacious disposition the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested new questions and new disputes and it was always in the power of an ambitious prelate or a fanatic monk to violate the peace of  the church and perhaps of the empire The historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the obscurity of schools and synods The Manichaeans who laboured to reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster had secretly introduced themselves into the provinces but these foreign sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics and the Imperial laws were executed by the public hatred The rational opinions of the Pelagians were propagated from Britain to Rome Africa and Palestine and silently expired in a superstitious age But the East was distracted by the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies which attempted to explain the mystery of the incarnation and hastened the ruin of Christianity in her native land These controversies were first agitated under the reign of the younger Theodosius but their important consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume The metaphysical chain of argument the contests of

foreign invasions By the loss of national independence you have acquired the name and privileges of Roman citizens You enjoy in common with ourselves the permanent benefits of civil government and your remote situation is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny Instead of  exercising the rights of conquest we have been contented to impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation Peace cannot be secured without armies and armies must be supported at the expence of the people It is for your sake not for our own that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the ferocious Germans who have so often attempted and who will always desire to exchange the solitude of their woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul The fall of Rome would be fatal to the provinces and you would be buried in the ruins of that mighty fabric which has been raised by the valour and wisdom of eight hundred years Your imaginary freedom would be insulted and oppressed by a savage master and the expulsion of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of the Barbarian conquerors  Eadern semper causa Germanis transcendendi in Gallias libido atque avaritiae

salutary advice was accepted and this strange prediction was accomplished In the space of four hundred years the hardy Gauls who had encountered the arms of Caesar were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of citizens and subjects the Western empire was dissolved and the Germans who had passed the Rhine fiercely contended for the possession of Gaul and excited the contempt or abhorrence of its peaceful and polished inhabitants With that conscious pride  which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North their rustic manners dissonant joy voracious appetite and their horrid appearance equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell The liberal studies were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bordeaux and the language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth Their ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic dialect and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre The Gauls were endowed with all the advantages of art and nature but as they wanted courage to defend them they were justly condemned to obey and even to flatter the victorious Barbarians by whose clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives  Sidonius Apollinaris ridicules with affected wit and pleasantry the hardships of his situation Carm xii in tom i p    As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western  Euric king of the Visigoths A D  empire he sought the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians The new sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric king of the Visigoths all the Roman conquests beyond the Alps as far as the Rhine and the Ocean  See Procopius de Bell Gothico l i c in tom ii p The character of

reluctant praise Sidonius waited before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants and their various business at the court of Bordeaux attested the power and the renown of the king of the Visigoths The Heruli of the distant ocean who painted their naked bodies with its caerulean colour implored his protection and the Saxons respected the maritime provinces of a prince who was destitute of any naval force The tall Burgundians submitted to his authority nor did he restore the captive Franks till he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace The

obeyed in peace the hereditary jurisdiction of their chiefs were free to follow the standard of a popular and victorious general and the superior merit of Clovis attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy When he first took the field he had neither gold and silver in his coffers nor wine and corn in his magazines  Gregory of Tours l v c in tom ii p contrasts the poverty of Clovis with the wealth of his grandsons Yet Remigius in tom iv p mentions his  paternas opes  as sufficient for the redemption of captives  but he imitated the example of Caesar who in the same country had acquired wealth by the sword and purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest After each successful battle or expedition the spoils were accumulated in one common mass every warrior received his proportionable share and the royal prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law The untamed spirit of the Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline  See Gregory l ii c in tom ii p The famous story of the vase of Soissons explains both the power and the character of Clovis As a point of controversy it has been strangely tortured by Boulainvilliers Dubos and the other political antiquarians  At the annual review  of the month of March their arms were diligently inspected and when they traversed a peaceful territory they were prohibited from touching a blade of grass The justice of Clovis was inexorable and his careless or disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death It would be superfluous to praise the valour of a Frank but the valour of Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence  The duke of Nivernois a noble statesman who has managed weighty and delicate negociations ingeniously illustrates Mem de l'Acad des Inscriptions tom xx p the political system of Clovis  In all his transactions with mankind he calculated the weight of interest of passion and of opinion and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans and sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome and Christianity He was intercepted in the career of victory since he died in the fortyfifth year of his age but he had already accomplished in a reign of thirty years the establishment of the French monarchy in Gaul  The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of  His victory over Syagrius A D  Syagrius the son of Aegidius and the public quarrel might on this occasion be inflamed by private resentment The glory of the father still insulted the Merovingian race the power of the son might

the title or at least with the authority of king of the Romans  I may observe that Fredegarius in his Epitome of Gregory of Tours tom ii p has prudently substituted the name of  Patricius  for the incredible title of  Rex Romanorum  As a Roman he had been educated in the liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence but he was engaged by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger who possessed the singular talent of explaining in their native tongue the dictates of reason and equity The diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular the impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary obedience and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil society  Sidonius l v epist in tom i p who stiles him the Solon the Amphion of the Barbarians addresses this imaginary king in the tone of friendship and equality From such offices of arbitration the crafty Dejoces had raised himself to the throne of the Medes Herodot l i c  In the midst of these peaceful occupations Syagrius received and boldly accepted the hostile

They were commensurate with the dioceses of Constance and Avenche or Lausanne and are still discriminated in modern Switzerland by the use of the German or French language  The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni who destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest A province improved and adorned by the arts of Rome was again reduced to a savage wilderness and some vestige of the stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous valley of the Aar  See Guilliman de Rebus Helveticis l i c p Within the ancient walls

with the Mein and the Moselle the formidable swarms of the Alemanni commanded either side of the river by the right of ancient possession or recent victory They had spread themselves into Gaul over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine and their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned the Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac about twentyfour miles from Cologne and the two fiercest nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits and the prospect of future greatness The Franks after an obstinate struggle gave way and the Alemanni raising a shout of victory impetuously pressed their retreat But the battle was restored by the valour the conduct and perhaps by the piety of Clovis and the event of the bloody day decided for ever the alternative of empire or servitude The last king of the Alemanni was slain in the field and his people was slaughtered and pursued till they threw down their arms and yielded to the mercy of the conqueror Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which might have protected their distress and they were followed into the heart of their forests by an enemy  not less active or intrepid than themselves The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married but he mildly interceded with his brother in favour of the suppliants and fugitives who had implored his protection The Gallic territories which were possessed by the Alemanni became the prize of their conqueror and the haughty nation invincible or rebellious to the arms of Rome acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and institutions under the government of official and at length of hereditary dukes After the conquest of the Western provinces the Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine They gradually subdued and civilised the exhausted countries as far as the Elbe and the mountains of Bohemia and the peace of Europe was secured by the obedience of Germany  Gregory of Tours l ii in tom ii p the Gesta Francorum in tom ii p and the epistle of Theodoric Cassiodor Variar l ii c in tom iv p represent the defeat of the

Clovis A D  to worship the gods of his ancestors  Clotilda or rather Gregory supposes that Clovis worshipped the gods of Greece and Rome The fact is incredible and the mistake only shews how completely in less than a century the national religion of the Franks had been abolished and even forgotten    His disbelief or rather disregard of Christianity might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the churches of an hostile territory but his subjects of Gaul enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship and the bishops entertained a more favourable hope of the idolater than of the heretics The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda the niece of the king of Burgundy who in the midst of an Arian court was educated in the profession of the Catholic faith It was her interest as well as her duty to atchieve the conversion  Gregory of Tours relates the marriage and conversion of Clovis l ii c in tom ii p Even Fredegarius or the nameless Epitomizer in tom ii p the author of the Gesta Francorum in tom ii p and Aimoin himself l i c in tom iii p may be heard without disdain Tradition might long preserve some curious circumstances of these important transactions  of a Pagan husband and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion He consented perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated to the baptism of his eldest son and though the sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears he was persuaded a second time to repeat the dangerous experiment In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac Clovis loudly invoked the god of Clotilda and the Christians and victory disposed him to hear with respectful gratitude  the eloquent  A traveller who returned from Rheims to Auvergne had stolen a copy of

the Catholic faith and the political reasons which might have suspended his public profession were removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks who shewed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of battle or to the baptismal font The important ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims with every circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes  A vial the  Sainte Ampoulle  of holy or rather celestial oil was brought down by a white dove for the baptism of Clovis and it is still used and renewed in the coronation of the kings of France Hincmar he aspired to the primacy of Gaul is the first author of this fable in tom iii p whose slight foundations the Abbé de Vertot Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom ii p has undermined with profound respect and consummate dexterity  The new Constantine was immediately baptised with three thousand of his warlike subjects and their example  was imitated by the remainder of the  gentle Barbarians  who in obedience to the victorious prelate adored the cross which they had burnt and burnt the idols which they had formerly adored  Mitis depone colla Sicamber adora quod incendisti incende quod adorasti Greg Turon l ii c in tom ii p  The mind of Clovis was susceptible of transient fervour he was exasperated by the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ and instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice he exclaimed with indiscreet fury  "Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks I would have revenged his injuries  Si ego ibidem cum Francis meis fuissem injurias ejus vindicassem This rash expression which Gregory has prudently concealed is celebrated by Fredegarius Epitom c in tom ii p Aimoin l i c in tom iii p and the Chroniques de St Denys l i c in tom iii p as an admirable effusion of Christian zeal  "  But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion which depends on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative theology He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of the gospel which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and Christian duties his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war and as soon as Clovis had dismissed a synod of the Gallican church he calmly assassinated  all  the princes of the Merovingian race  Gregory l ii c in tom ii p after coolly relating the repeated crimes and affected remorse of Clovis concludes perhaps undesignedly with a lesson which ambition will never hear "His ita transactis obiit"  Yet the king of the  Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God as a Being more excellent and powerful than his national deities and the signal deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts Martin the most popular of the saints had filled the Western world with the fame of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of Tours His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal and orthodox prince and the profane remark of Clovis himself that St Martin was an expensive friend  After the Gothic victory Clovis made rich offerings to St Martin of Tours He wished to redeem his warhorse by the gift of one hundred pieces of gold but the enchanted steed could not move from the stable till the price of his redemption had been doubled This  miracle  provoked the king to exclaim Vere B Martinus est bonus in auxilio sed carus in negotio Gesta Francorum in tom ii p  need not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism But earth as well as heaven rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks On the memorable day when Clovis ascended from the baptismal font he alone in the Christian world deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king The emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the nature of the divine incarnation and the Barbarians of Italy Africa Spain and Gaul were involved in the Arian heresy The eldest or rather the only son of the church was acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign  or glorious deliverer and the arms of Clovis were strenuously supported by the zeal and favour of the Catholic faction  See the epistle from pope Anastasius to the royal convert in tom iv p Avitus bishop of Vienna addressed Clovis on the same subject p and many of the Latin bishops would assure him of their joy and attachment    Under the Roman empire the wealth and jurisdiction  Submission of the Armoricans and the Roman troops A D c  of the bishops their sacred character and perpetual office their numerous dependents popular eloquence and provincial assemblies had rendered them always respectable and sometimes dangerous Their influence was augmented with the progress of superstition and the establishment of the French monarchy may in some degree be ascribed to the firm alliance of an hundred prelates who reigned in the discontented or independent cities of Gaul The slight foundations of the  Armorican  republic had been repeatedly shaken or overthrown but the same people still guarded their domestic freedom asserted the dignity of the Roman name and bravely resisted the predatory inroads and regular attacks of Clovis who laboured to extend his conquests from the Seine to the Loire Their successful opposition introduced an equal and honourable union The Franks esteemed the valour of the Armoricans  Instead of the  an unknown people who now appear in the text of Procopius Hadrian de Valois has restored the proper name of the  and this easy correction has been almost universally approved Yet an unprejudiced reader would naturally suppose that Procopius means to describe a tribe of Germans in the alliance of Rome and not a confederacy of Gallic cities which had revolted from the empire  and the Armoricans  were reconciled by the religion of the Franks The military force which had been stationed for the defence of Gaul consisted of one hundred different bands of cavalry or infantry and these troops while they assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers were renewed by an incessant supply of the Barbarian youth The extreme fortifications and scattered fragments of the empire were still defended by their hopeless courage But their retreat was intercepted and their communication was impracticable they were abandoned by the Greek princes of Constantinople and they piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of Gaul They accepted without shame or reluctance the generous capitulation which was proposed by a Catholic hero and this spurious or legitimate progeny of the Roman legions was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms their ensigns and their peculiar dress and institutions But the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary accessions and the neighbouring kingdoms dreaded the numbers as well as the spirit of the Franks The reduction of the Northern provinces of Gaul instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each object of his ambition by such efforts or such concessions as were adequate to its real value  His  savage character and the virtues of Henry IV suggest the most opposite ideas of human nature yet some resemblance may be found in the situation  of two princes who conquered France by their valour their policy and the merits of a seasonable conversion  This important digression of Procopius de Bell Gothic l i c in tom ii p illustrates the origin of the French monarchy Yet I must observe That the Greek historian betrays an inexcusable ignorance of the geography of the West That these treaties and

annotations has explained many circumstances relative to the Burgundian monarchy  The sceptre was in the hands of Gundobald That valiant and ambitious prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers one of whom was the father of Clotilda  Mascou Hist of the Germans xi who very reasonably distrusts the testimony of Gregory of Tours has produced a passage from Avitus epist v to prove that Gundobald affected to deplore the tragic event which his subjects affected to applaud  but his imperfect prudence still permitted Godegesil the youngest of his brothers to possess the dependent principality of Geneva The Arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction and the hopes which seemed to animate his  clergy and people after the conversion of Clovis and Gundobald convened at Lyons an assembly of his bishops to reconcile if it were possible their religious and political discontents A vain conference was agitated between the two factions The Arians upbraided the Catholics with the worship of three Gods the Catholics defended their cause by theological distinctions and the usual arguments objections and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamour till the king revealed his secret apprehensions by an abrupt but decisive question which he addressed to the orthodox bishops  "If you truly profess the Christian religion why do you not restrain the king of the Franks He has declared war against me and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction A sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere conversion let him shew his faith by his works"  The answer of Avitus bishop of Vienna who spoke in the name of his brethren was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel  "We are ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks but we are taught by scripture that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are frequently subverted and that enemies will arise on every side against those who have made God their enemy Return with thy people to the law of God and he will give peace and security to thy dominions"  The king of Burgundy who was not prepared to accept the condition which the Catholics considered as essential to the treaty  delayed and dismissed the ecclesiastical conference after reproaching his bishops that Clovis their friend and proselyte had privately tempted the allegiance of his brother  See the original conference in tom iv p Avitus the principal actor and probably the secretary of the meeting was bishop of Vienna A short account of his person and works may be found in Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom v p    The allegiance of his brother was already seduced  Victory of Clovis A D  and the obedience of Godegesil who joined the royal standard with the troops of Geneva more effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy While the Franks and Burgundians contended with equal valour his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle and as Gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected Gauls he yielded to the arms of Clovis and hastily retreated from the field which appears to have been situate between Langres and Dijon He distrusted the strength of Dijon a quadrangular fortress encompassed by two rivers and by a wall thirty feet high and fifteen thick with four gates and thirtythree towers  Gregory of Tours l iii c in tom ii p indulges his genius or rather transcribes some more eloquent writer in the description of Dijon a castle which already deserved the title of a city It depended on the bishops of Langres till the twelfth century and afterwards became the capital of the dukes of Burgundy Longuerue Description de la France part i p  he abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important cities of Lyons and Vienna and Gundobald still fled with precipitation till he had reached Avignon at the distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle A long  siege and an artful negociation admonished the king of the Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise He imposed a tribute on the Burgundian prince compelled him to pardon and reward his brother's treachery and proudly returned to his own dominions with the spoils and captives of the southern provinces This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the intelligence that Gundobald had violated his recent obligations and that the unfortunate Godegesil who was left at Vienna with a garrison of five thousand Franks  The Epitomizer of Gregory of Tours in tom ii p has supplied this number of Franks but he rashly supposes that they were cut in pieces by Gundobald The prudent Burgundian spared the soldiers of Clovis and sent these captives to the king of the Visigoths who settled them in the territory of Thoulouse  had been besieged surprised and massacred by his inhuman brother Such an outrage might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign yet the conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury released the tribute and accepted the alliance and military service of the king of Burgundy Clovis no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding war and his rival instructed by adversity had found new resources in the affections of his people The Gauls or Romans applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald which almost raised them to the same level with their conquerors The bishops were reconciled and flattered by the hopes which he artfully suggested of his approaching conversion and though he eluded their  accomplishment to the last moment of his life his moderation secured the peace and suspended the ruin of the kingdom of Burgundy  In this Burgundian war I have followed Gregory of Tours l ii c in tom ii p whose narrative  appears  so

Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honours of a saint and martyr  See his life or legend in tom iii p A martyr how strangely has that word been distorted from its original sense of a common witness St Sigismond was remarkable for the cure of fevers  but the hands of the royal saint were stained with the blood of his innocent son whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a stepmother He soon discovered his error and bewailed the irreparable loss While Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants  "It is not his situation O king it is thine which deserves pity and lamentation"  The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated however by his liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum or St Maurice in Vallais which he himself had founded in honour of the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion  Before the end of the fifth century the church of St Maurice and his Thebaean legion had rendered Agaunum a place of devout pilgrimage A promiscuous community of both sexes had introduced some deeds of darkness which were abolished A D by the regular monastery of Sigismond Within fifty years his  angels of light  made a nocturnal sally to murder their bishop and his clergy See in the Bibliotheque Raisonnée tom xxxvi p the curious remark of a learned librarian of Geneva  A full chorus of  perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks and it was his humble prayer that heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his sins His prayer was heard the avengers were at hand and the provinces of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks After the event of an unsuccessful battle Sigismond who wished to protract his life that he might prolong his pennance concealed himself in the desert in a religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects who solicited the favour of their new masters The captive monarch with his wife and two children was transported to Orleans and buried alive in a deep well by the stern command of the sons of Clovis whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age Their ambition which urged them to atchieve the conquest of Burgundy was inflamed or disguised by filial piety and Clotilda whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries pressed them to revenge her father's death on the family of his assassin The rebellious Burgundians for they attempted to break their chains were still permitted to enjoy their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military service and the Merovingian  princes peaceably reigned over a kingdom whose glory and greatness had been first overthrown by the arms of Clovis  Marius bishop of Avenche Chron in tom ii p has marked the authentic dates and Gregory of Tours l iii c in tom ii p has expressed the principal facts of the life of Sigismond and the conquest of Burgundy Procopius in tom ii p and Agathias in tom ii p shew their remote and imperfect knowledge    The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honour of the Goths They viewed his rapid progress  The Gothic war A D  with jealousy and terror and the youthful fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius of his rival Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their contiguous dominions and after the delays of fruitless negociation a personal interview of the two kings was proposed and accepted This conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a small island of the Loire near Amboise They embraced familiarly conversed and feasted together and separated with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love But their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous designs and their mutual complaints solicited eluded and disclaimed a final arbitration At Paris which he already considered as his royal seat Clovis declared to an assembly of the princes and warriors the pretence and the motive of a Gothic war  "It grieves me to see that the Arians still possess the fairest portion of Gaul Let us march against them with the aid of God and having vanquished the heretics we will possess and divide their fertile provinces  Gregory of Tours l ii c in tom ii p inserts the short but persuasive speech of Clovis Valde moleste fero quod hi Ariani partem teneant Galliarum the author of the Gesta Francorum in tom ii p adds the precious epithet of  optimam  eamus cum Dei adjutorio et superatis eis redigamus terram in ditionem nostram  "  The Franks who were inspired by hereditary valour and recent zeal applauded the generous design of their monarch expressed their resolution to conquer or die since death and conquest would be equally profitable and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow The enterprise was promoted by the public or private exhortations of Clotilda She reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity and his servants and the Christian hero darting his battle axe with a skilful and nervous hand  "There said he on that spot where my  Francisca  Tunc rex projecit a se in directum Bipennem suam quod est  Francisca  c Gesta Franc in tom ii p The form and use of this weapon are clearly described by Procopius in tom ii p Examples of its  national  appellation in Latin and French may be found in the Glossary of Ducange and the large Dictionnaire de

devout wishes were gradually ripened into a formidable conspiracy The people of Aquitain was alarmed by the indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants who justly accused them of preferring the dominion of the  Franks and their zealous adherent Quintianus bishop of Rodez  It is singular enough that some important and authentic facts should be found in a life of Quintianus composed in rhyme

of the Burgundians Alaric collected his troops far more numerous than the military powers of Clovis The Visigoths resumed the exercise of arms which they had neglected in a long and luxurious peace  Quamvis fortitudini vestrae confidentiam tribuat parentum vestrorum innumerabilis multitudo quamvis Attilam potentem reminiscamini Visigotharum viribus inclinatum tamen quia populorum ferocia corda

obliged all masters to arm and send or lead into the field a tenth of their slaves  and the cities of Gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths who reigned in Italy had laboured to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul and he assumed or affected for that purpose the impartial character of a mediator But the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of Clovis and he was firmly engaged to support the national and religious cause of the Goths  The accidental or artificial prodigies which adorned the expedition of Clovis were accepted by a superstitious age as the manifest declaration  Victory of Clovis A D  of the Divine favour He marched from Paris and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of St Martin the sanctuary and the oracle of Gaul His messengers were instructed to remark the words of the Psalm which should happen to be chaunted at the precise moment when they entered the church Those words most fortunately expressed the valour and victory of the champions of Heaven and the application was easily transferred to the new Joshua the new Gideon who went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord  This mode of divination by accepting as an omen the first sacred words which in particular circumstances should be presented to the eye or ear was derived from the Pagans and the Psalter or Bible was substituted to the Poems of Homer and Virgil From the fourth to the fourteenth century these  sortes sanctorum  as they are stiled were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of councils and repeatedly practised by kings bishops and saints See a curious dissertation of the Abbé du Resnel in the Memoires de l'Academie tom xix p  Orleans secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire but at the distance of forty miles from Poitiers their progress was intercepted by an extraordinary swell of the river Vigenna or Vienne and the opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians who consume the country through which they march and had Clovis possessed leisure and materials it might  have been impracticable to construct a bridge or to force a passage in the face of a superior enemy But the affectionate peasants who were impatient to welcome their deliverer could easily betray some unknown or unguarded ford the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful interposition of fraud or fiction and a white hart of singular size and beauty appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic army The counsels of the Visigoths were irresolute and distracted A crowd of impatient warriors presumptuous in their strength and disdaining to sly before the robbers of Germany excited Alaric to assert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of Rome The advice of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardour of the Franks and to expect in the southern provinces of Gaul the veteran and victorious Ostrogoths whom the king of Italy had already sent to his assistance The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation the Goths too hastily abandoned perhaps an advantageous post and the opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly motions After Clovis had passed the ford as it is still named of the  Hart  he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor suspended in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers and this signal which might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St Hilary was compared to the column of fire that guided the  Israelites in the desert At the third hour of the day about ten miles beyond Poitiers Clovis overtook and instantly attacked the Gothic army whose defeat was already prepared by terror and confusion Yet they rallied in their extreme distress and the martial youths who had clamorously demanded the battle refused to survive the ignominy of flight The two kings encountered each other in single combat Alaric fell by the hand of his rival and the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass and the vigour of his horse from the spears of two desperate Goths who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their sovereign The vague expression of a mountain of the slain serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter but Gregory has carefully observed that his valiant countryman Apollinaris the son of Sidonius lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne Perhaps these suspected Catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal attachment or military honour  After correcting the text or excusing the mistake of Procopius who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcassone we may conclude from the evidence of Gregory Fortunatus and the author of the Gesta Francorum that the battle was fought  in campo Vocladensi  on the banks of the Clain about ten miles to the south of Poitiers Clovis overtook and attacked the Visigoths near Vivonne and the victory was decided near a village still named Champagné St Hilaire See the Dissertations of the Abbé le Boeuf tom i p    Such is the empire of Fortune if we may still  Conquest of Aquitain by the Franks A D  disguise our ignorance under that popular name  that it is almost equally difficult to foresee the events of war or to explain their various consequences A bloody and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession of the field and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy in a single day the work of ages The decisive battle of Poitiers was followed by the conquest of Aquitain Alaric had left behind him an infant son a bastard competitor factious nobles and a disloyal people and the remaining forces of the Goths were oppressed by the general consternation or opposed to each other in civil discord The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay to the siege of Angoulême At the sound of his trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho and instantly fell to the ground a splendid miracle which may be reduced to the supposition that some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart  Angoulême is in the road from Poitiers to Bordeaux and although Gregory delays the siege I can more readily believe that he confounded the order of history than that Clovis neglected the rules of war  At Bordeaux which had submitted without resistance Clovis established his winterquarters and his prudent oeconomy transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures which were deposited in the capital of the monarchy The conqueror penetrated as far as the confines of Spain  Pyrenaeos montes usque Perpinianum subjecit is the expression of Rorico which betrays his recent date since

While the balance was still equal Theodoric had perhaps delayed the march of the Ostrogoths but their strenuous efforts successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis and the army of the Franks and their Burgundian allies was compelled to raise the siege of Arles with the loss as it is said of thirty thousand men These vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace The Visigoths were suffered to retain the possession of Septimania a narrow tract of seacoast from the Rhone to the Pyrenees but the ample province of Aquitain from those mountains to the Loire was indissolubly united to the kingdom of France  In the composition of the Gothic war I have used the following materials with due regard to their unequal value Four epistles

not receive any new accessions from the consular dignity It was a name a shadow an empty pageant and if the conqueror had been instructed  to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high office they must have expired with the period of its annual duration But the Romans were disposed to revere in the person of their master that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume the Barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the majesty of the republic and the successors of Theodosius by soliciting his friendship tacitly forgave and almost ratified the usurpation of Gaul  Twentyfive years after the death of Clovis  Final establishment of the French monarchy in Gaul A D  this important concession was more formally declared in a treaty between his sons and the emperor Justinian The Ostrogoths of Italy unable to defend their distant acquisitions had resigned to the Franks the cities of Arles and Marseilles of Arles still adorned with the seat of a Praetorian praefect and of Marseilles enriched by the advantages of trade and navigation  Under the Merovingian kings Marseilles still imported from the East paper wine oil linen silk precious stones spices c The Gauls or Franks traded to Syria and the Syrians were established in Gaul See M de Guignes Mem de l'Academie tom xxxvii p  This transaction was confirmed by the Imperial authority and Justinian generously yielding to the Franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond the Alps which they already possessed absolved the provincials from their allegiance and established on a more lawful though not more solid foundation the throne of the Merovingians  This strong declaration of Procopius de Bell Gothic l iii cap in tom ii p would almost suffice to justify the Abbé Dubos    From that aera they enjoyed the right of celebrating at Arles the games of the Circus and by a singular privilege which was denied even to the Persian monarch the  gold  coin impressed with their name and image obtained a legal currency in the empire  The Franks who probably used the mints of Treves Lyons and Arles imitated the coinage of the Roman emperors of seventytwo  solidi  or pieces to the pound of gold But as the Franks established only a decuple proportion of gold and silver ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of gold It was the common standard of the Barbaric fines and contained forty  denarii  or silver threepences Twelve of these denarii made a  solidus  or shilling the twentieth part of the ponderal and numeral  livre  or pound of silver which has been so strangely reduced in modern France See le Blanc Traite Historique des Monnoyes de France p c  A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and public virtues of the Franks with a partial enthusiasm which cannot be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals  Agathias in tom ii p Gregory of Tours exhibits a very different picture Perhaps it would not be easy within the same historical space to find more vice and less virtue We are continually shocked by the union of savage and corrupt manners  He celebrates their politeness and urbanity their regular government and orthodox religion and boldly asserts that these Barbarians could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of Rome Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social disposition and lively graces which in every age have disguised their vices and sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit Perhaps Agathias and the Greeks were dazzled by the rapid  progress of their arms and the splendour of their empire Since the conquest of Burgundy Gaul except the Gothic province of Septimania was subject in its whole extent to the sons of Clovis They had extinguished the German kingdom of Thuringia and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine into the heart of their native forests The Alemanni and Bavarians who had occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum to the south of the Danube confessed themselves the humble vassals of the Franks and the feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of resisting their ambition When the last survivor of the sons of Clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the Merovingians his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern France Yet modern France such has been the progress of arts and policy far surpasses in wealth populousness and power the spacious but savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert  M de Foncemagne has traced in a correct and elegant dissertation Mem de l'Academie tom viii p the extent and limits of the French monarchy    The Franks or French are the only people of  Political controversy  Europe who can deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western empire But their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries of anarchy and ignorance On the revival of learning the students who had been formed in the schools of Athens and Rome disdained their Barbarian ancestors and a long  period elapsed before patient labour could provide the requisite materials to satisfy or rather to excite the curiosity of more enlightened times  The Abbé Dubos Histoire Critique tom i p has truly and agreeably represented the slow progress of these studies and he observes that Gregory of Tours was only once printed before the year According to the complaint of Heineccius Opera tom iii Sylloge iii p c Germany received with indifference and contempt the codes of Barbaric laws which were published by Heroldus Lindenbrogius c At present those laws as far as they relate to Gaul the history of Gregory of Tours and all the monuments of the Merovingian race appear in a pure and perfect state in the first four volumes of the Historians of France  At length the eye of criticism and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of France but even philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion The most extreme and exclusive systems of the personal servitude of the Gauls or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the Franks have been rashly conceived and obstinately defended and the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against the prerogative of the crown the dignity of the nobles or the freedom of the people Yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius and each antagonist alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated some ancient errors and established some interesting truths An impartial stranger instructed by their discoveries their disputes and even their faults may describe from the same original materials the state of the Roman provincials after Gaul had submitted  to the arms and laws of the Merovingian kings  In the space of thirty years this interesting subject has been agitated by the free spirit of the Count de Boulainvilliers Memoires Historiques sur l'Etat de la France particularly tom i p the learned ingenuity of

regulated however by some fixed and general rules When Tacitus surveyed the primitive simplicity of the Germans he discovered some permanent maxims or customs of public and private life which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction of the art of writing and of the Latin tongue  I have derived much instruction from two learned works of Heineccius the  History  and the  Elements  of the Germanic law In a judicious preface to the Elements he considers and tries to excuse the defects of that barbarous jurisprudence  Before the election of the Merovingian kings the most powerful tribe or nation of the Franks appointed four venerable chieftains to compose the  Salic  laws  Latin appears to have been the original language of the Salic law It was probably composed in the beginning of the fifth century before the aera A D of the real or fabulous Pharamond The preface mentions the four Cantons which produced the four legislators and many provinces Franconia Saxony Hanover Brabant c have claimed them as their own See an excellent Dissertation of Heineccius de Lege Salicà tom iii Sylloge iii p  and their labours were examined and approved in three successive assemblies of the people After the baptism of Clovis he reformed  several articles that appeared incompatible with Christianity the Salic law was again amended by his sons and at length under the reign of Dagobert the code was revised and promulgated in its actual form one hundred years after the establishment of the French monarchy Within the same period the customs of the  Ripuarians  were transcribed and published and Charlemagne himself the legislator of his age and country had accurately studied the  two  national laws which still prevailed among the Franks  Eginhard in Vit Caroli Magni c in tom v p By these two laws most critics understand the Salic and the Ripuarian The former extended from the Carbonarian forest to the Loire tom iv p and the latter might be obeyed from the same forest to the Rhine tom iv p  The same care was extended to their vassals and the rude institutions of the  Alemanni  and  Bavarians  were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme authority of the Merovingian kings The  Visigoths  and  Burgundians  whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the Franks shewed less impatience to attain one of the principal benefits of civilised society Euric was the first of the Gothic princes who expressed in writing the manners and customs of his people and the composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure of policy rather than of justice to alleviate the yoke and regain the affections of their Gallic subjects  Consult the ancient and modern prefaces of the several Codes in the fourth volume of the Historians of France The original prologue to the Salic law expresses though in a foreign dialect the genuine spirit of the Franks more forcibly than the ten books of Gregory of Tours  Thus by a singular coincidence the  Germans framed their artless institutions at a time when the elaborate system of Roman jurisprudence was finally consummated In the Salic laws and the Pandects of Justinian we may compare the first rudiments and the full maturity of civil wisdom and whatever prejudices may be suggested in favour of Barbarism our calmer reflections will ascribe to the Romans the superior advantages not only of science and reason but of humanity and justice Yet the laws of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires their occupations and their capacity and they all contributed to preserve the peace and promote the improvements of the society for whose use they were originally established The Merovingians instead of imposing an uniform rule of conduct on their various subjects permitted each people and each family of their empire freely to enjoy their domestic institutions  The Ripuarian law declares and defines this indulgence in favour of the plaintiff tit xxxi in tom iv p and the same toleration is understood or expressed in all the Codes except that of the Visigoths of Spain Tanta diversitas legum says Agobard in the ninth century quanta non solum in regionibus aut civitatibus sed etiam in multis domibus habetur Nam plerumque contingit ut simul eant aut sedeant quinque homines et nullus eorum communem legem cum altero habeat in tom vi p He foolishly proposes to introduce an uniformity of law as well as of faith  nor were the Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration  Inter Romanos negotia causarum Romanis legibus praecipimus terminari Such are the words of a general constitution promulgated by Clotaire the son of Clovis and sole monarch of the Franks in tom iv p about the year  The  children embraced the  law  of their parents the wife that of her husband the freedman that of his patron and in all causes where the parties were of different nations the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of the defendant who may always plead a judicial presumption of right or innocence A more ample latitude was allowed if every citizen in the presence of the judge might declare the law under which he desired to live and the national society to which he chose to belong Such an indulgence would abolish the partial distinctions of victory and the Roman provincials might patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition since it depended on themselves to assume the privilege if they dared to assert the character of free and warlike Barbarians  This liberty of choice has been aptly deduced Esprit des Loix l xxviii from a constitution of Lothaire I Leg Langobard l ii tit lvii in Codex Lindebrog p though the example is too recent and partial From a various reading in the Salic law tit xliv not xlv the Abbé de Mably tom i p has conjectured that at first a  Barbarian  only and afterwards any  man  consequently a Roman might live according to the law of the Franks I am sorry to offend this ingenious conjecture by observing that the stricter sense  Barbarum  is expressed in the reformed copy of Charlemagne which is confirmed by the Royal and Wolfenbuttle MSS The looser interpretation  hominem  is authorised only by the MS of Fulda from whence Heroldus published his edition See the four original toxts of the Salic law in tom iv p    When justice inexorably requires the death of  Pecuniary fines for homicide  a murderer each private citizen is fortified by the assurance that the laws the magistrate and  the whole community are the guardians of his personal safety But in the loose society of the Germans revenge was always honourable and often meritorious the independent warrior chastised or vindicated with his own hand the injuries which he had offered or received and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions The magistrate conscious of his weakness interposed not to punish but to reconcile and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood  In the heroic times of Greece the guilt of murder was expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the deceased Feithius Antiquitat Homeric l ii c Heineccius in his preface to the Elements of Germanic Law favourably suggests that at Rome and Athens homicide was only punished with exile It is true but exile was a  capital  punishment for a citizen of Rome or Athens  The fierce spirit of the Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints and when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt In every just government the same penalty is inflicted or at least is imposed for the murder of a peasant or a prince But the national inequality established by the Franks in their criminal proceedings was the last insult  and abuse of conquest  This proportion is fixed by the Salic tit xliv in tom iv p and the Ripuarian tit vii xi xxxvi in tom iv p laws but the latter does not distinguish any difference of Romans Yet the orders of the clergy are placed above the Franks themselves and the Burgundians and Alemanni between the Franks and the Romans  In the calm moments of legislation they solemnly pronounced that the life of a Roman was of smaller value than that of a Barbarian The  Antrustion  The  Antrustiones qui in truste Dominicâ sunt leudi fideles  undoubtedly represent the first order of Franks but it is a question whether their rank was personal or hereditary The Abbé de Mably tom i p is not displeased to mortify the pride of birth Esprit l xxx c by dating the  origin  of French nobility from the reign of Clotaire II A D  a name expressive of the most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks was appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold while the noble provincial who was admitted to the king's table might be legally murdered at the expence of three hundred pieces Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary condition but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred or even fifty pieces of gold Had these laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason the public protection should have supplied in just proportion the want of personal strength But the legislator had weighed in the scale not of justice but of policy the loss of a soldier against that of a slave the head of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by an heavy fine and the slightest aid was afforded to  the most defenceless subjects Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and the patience of the vanquished and the boldest citizen was taught by experience that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict As the manners of the Franks became less ferocious their laws were rendered more severe and the Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigour of the Visigoths and Burgundians  See the Burgundian laws tit ii in tom iv p the Code of the Visigoths l vi tit v in tom iv p and the constitution of  Childebert  not of Paris but most evidently of Austrasia in tom iv p Their premature severity was sometimes rash and excessive Childebert condemned not only murderers but robbers quomodo sine lege involavit sine lege moriatur and even the negligent judge was involved in the same sentence The Visigoths abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to the family of his deceased patient ut quod de eo facere voluerint habeant potestatem l xi tit i in tom iv p  Under the empire of Charlemagne murder was universally punished with death and the use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the jurisprudence of modern Europe  See in the sixth volume of the works of Heineccius the Elementa Juris Germanici l ii p ii No Yet some vestiges of these pecuniary compositions for murder have been traced in Germany as late as the sixteenth century    The civil and military professions which had  Judgments of God  been separated by Constantine were again united by the Barbarians The harsh sound of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke of Count or of Praefect and the same officer assumed within his district the command of the troops and the administration of  justice  The whole subject of the Germanic judges and their jurisdiction is copiously treated by Heineccius Element Jur Germ l iii No I cannot find any proof that under the Merovingian race the  scabini  or assessors were chosen by the people  But the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a judge which require all the faculties of a philolophic mind laboriously cultivated by experience and study and his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple and visible methods of ascertaining the cause of justice In every religion the Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth or to punish the falsehood of human testimony but this powerful instrument was misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the German legislators The party accused might justify his innocence by producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses who solemnly declared their belief or assurance that he was not guilty According to the weight of the charge this legal number of  compurgators  was multiplied seventytwo voices were required to absolve an incendiary or assassin and when the chastity of a queen of France was suspected three hundred gallant nobles swore without hesitation that the infant prince had been actually begotten by her deceased husband  Gregor Turon l viii c in tom ii p Montesquieu observes Esprit des Loix l xxviii c that the Salic law did not admit these  negative proofs  so universally established in the Barbaric codes Yet this obscure concubine Fredegundis who became the wife of the grandson of Clovis must have followed the Salic law  The sin and scandal of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged  the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water These extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived that in some cases guilt and innocence in others could not be proved without the interposition of a miracle Such miracles were readily provided by fraud and credulity the most intricate causes were determined by this easy and infallible method and the turbulent Barbarians who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God  Muratori in the Antiquities of Italy has given two Dissertations xxxviii xxxix on the  judgments of God  It was expected that  fire  would not burn the innocent and that the pure element of  water  would not allow the guilty to sink into its bosom    But the trials by single combat gradually obtained  Judicial combats  superior credit and authority among a warlike people who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer or that a coward deserved to live  Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxviii c has condescended to explain and excuse "la maniere de penser de nos peres" on the subject of judicial combats He follows this strange institution from the age of Gundobald to that of St Lewis and the philosopher is sometimes lost in the legal antiquarian  Both in civil and criminal proceedings the plaintiff or accuser the defendant or even the witness were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honour in the lists of battle They fought either on foot or on horseback according  to the custom of their nation  In a memorable duel at AixlaChapelle A D before the emperor Lewis the Pious his biographer observes secundum legem propriam utpote quia uterque Gothus erat equestri pugnâ congressus est Vit Lud Pii c in tom vi p Ermoldus Nigellus l iii in tom vi p who describes the duel admires the  ars nova  of fighting on horseback which was unknown to the Franks  and the decision of the sword or lance was ratified by the sanction of Heaven of the judge and of the people This sanguinary law was introduced into Gaul by the Burgundians and their legislator Gundobald  In his original edict published at Lyons A D Gundobald establishes and justifies the use of judicial combat Leg Burgund tit xlv in tom ii p Three hundred years afterwards Agobard bishop of Lyons solicited Lewis the Pious to abolish the law of an Arian tyrant in tom vi p He relates the conversation of Gundobald and Avitus  condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject Avitus  "Is it not true" said the king of Burgundy to the bishop "that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgment of God and that his providence awards the victory to the juster cause"  By such prevailing arguments the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe from Sicily to the Baltic At the end of ten centuries the reign of legal violence was not totally extinguished and the ineffectual censures of saints of popes and of synods may seem to prove that the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason and  humanity The tribunals were stained with the blood perhaps of innocent and respectable citizens the law which now favours the rich then yielded to the strong and the old the feeble and the infirm were condemned either to renounce their fairest claims and possessions to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict  "Accidit says Agobard ut non solum valentes viribus sed etiam infirmi et senes lacessantur ad pugnam etiam pro vilissimis rebus Quibus foralibus certaminibus contingunt homicidia injusta et crudeles ac perversi eventus judiciorum"  Like a prudent rhetorician he suppresses the legal privilege of hiring champions  or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion This oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of Gaul who complained of any injuries in their persons and property Whatever might be the strength or courage of individuals the victorious Barbarians excelled in the love and exercise of arms and the vanquished Roman was unjustly summoned to repeat in his own person the bloody contest which had been already decided against his country  Montesquien Esprit des Loix xxviii c who understands  why  the judicial combat was admitted by the Burgundians Ripuarians Alemanni Bavarians Lombards Thuringians Frisons and Saxons is satisfied and Agobard seems to countenance the assertion that it was not allowed by the Salic law Yet the same custom at least in cases of treason is mentioned by Ermoldus Nigellus l iii in tom vi p and the anonymous biographer of Lewis the Pious c in tom vi p as the "mos antiquus Francorum more Francis solito" c expressions too general to exclude the noblest of their tribes    A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly passed the Rhine  Division of lands by the Barbarians  under the command of Ariovistus One third  part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third for the accommodation of a new colony of twentyfour thousand Barbarians whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul  Caesar de Bell Gall l i c in tom i p  At the distance of five hundred years the Visigoths and Burgundians who revenged the defeat of Ariovistus usurped the same unequal proportion of  two thirds  of the subject lands But this distribution instead of spreading over the province may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where the victorious people had been planted by their own choice or by the policy of their leader In these districts each Barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some Roman provincial To this unwelcome guest the proprietor was compelled to abandon twothirds of his patrimony but the German a shepherd and a hunter might sometimes content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture and resign the smallest though most valuable portion to the toil of the industrious husbandman  The obseure hints of a division of lands occasionally scattered in the laws of the Burgundians tit liv No in tom iv p and Visigoths l x tit i No in tom iv p are skilfully explained by the president Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxx c I shall only add that among the Goths the division seems to have been ascertained by the judgment of the neighbourhood that the Barbarians frequently usurped the remaining  third  and that the Romans might recover their right unless they were barred by a prescription of fifty years  The silence of ancient and authentic  testimony has encouraged an opinion that the rapine of the  Franks  was not moderated or disguised by the forms of a legal division that they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul without order or controul and that each victorious robber according to his wants his avarice and his strength measured with his sword the extent of his new inheritance At a distance from their sovereign the Barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation but the firm and artful policy of Clovis must curb a licentious spirit which would aggravate the misery of the vanquished whilst it corrupted the union and discipline of the conquerors The memorable vase of Soissons is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the Gallic spoils It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to provide rewards for a successful army and settlements for a numerous people without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal catholics of Gaul The ample fund which he might lawfully acquire of the Imperial patrimony vacant lands and Gothic usurpations would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation and the humble provincials would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss  It is singular enough that the president de Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxx c and the Abbé de Mably Observations tom i p agree in this strange supposition of arbitrary and private rapine The count de Boulainvilliers Etat de la France tom i p shews a strong understanding through a cloud of ignorance and prejudice    The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their extensive domain After the conquest of Gaul they still delighted in the rustic  Domain and benefices of the Merovingians  simplicity of their ancestors the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay and their coins their charters and their synods are still inscribed with the names of the villas or rural palaces in which they successively resided One hundred and sixty of these  palaces  a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom and if some might claim the honours of a fortress the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms The mansion of the longhaired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables for the cattle and the poultry the garden was planted with useful vegetables the various trades the labours of agriculture and even the arts of hunting and fishing were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign his magazines were filled with corn and wine either for sale or consumption and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private oeconomy  See the rustic edict or rather code of Charlemagne which contains seventy distinct and minute regulations of that great monarch in tom v p He requires an account of the horns and skins of the goats allows his fish to be sold and carefully directs that the larger villas  Capitaneae  shall maintain one hundred hens and thirty geese and the smaller  Mansionales  fifty hens and twelve geese Mabillon de Re Diplomaticâ has investigated the names the number and the situation of the Merovingian villas  This ample patrimony  was appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his successors and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions who both in peace and war were devoted to their personal service Instead of an horse or a suit of armour each companion according to his rank or merit or favour was invested with a  benefice  the primitive name and most simple form of the feudal possessions These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the sovereign and his feeble prerogative derived some support from the influence of his liberality But this dependent tenure was gradually abolished  From a passage of the Burgundian law tit i No in tom iv p it is evident that a deserving son might expect to hold the lands which his father had received from the royal bounty of Gundobald The Burgundians would firmly maintain their privilege and their example might encourage the beneficiaries of France  by the independent and rapacious nobles of France who established the perpetual property and hereditary succession of their benefices a revolution salutary to the earth which had been injured or neglected by its precarious masters  The revolutions of the benefices and siess are clearly fixed by the Abbé de Mably His accurate distinction of  times  gives him a merit to which even Montesquieu is a stranger  Besides these royal and beneficiary estates a large proportion had been assigned in the division of Gaul of  allodial  and  Salic  lands they were exempt from tribute and the Salic lands were equally shared among the male descendants of the Franks  See the Salic law tit lxii in tom iv p The origin and nature of these Salic lands which in times of ignorance were perfectly understood now perplex our most learned and sagacious critics    In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces who under the appellation of  Seniors  Private usurpations  or Lords usurped a right to govern and a licence to oppress the subjects of their peculiar territory Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal but the laws were extinguished and the sacrilegious Barbarians who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or bishop  Many of the two hundred and six miracles of St Martin Greg Turon in Maximâ Bibliothecâ Patrum tom xi p were repeatedly performed to punish sacrilege Audite

Gregory of Tours c that it was practised without censure under the Merovingian race and even Grotius himself de Jure Belli et Pacis l iii c as well as his commentator Barbeyrac have laboured to reconcile it with the laws of nature and reason  and the fruitful cause of personal slavery which had been almost suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of Rome was again revived and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent Barbarians The Goth the Burgundian or the Frank who returned from a successful expedition dragged after him a long train of sheep of oxen and of human captives whom he treated with the same brutal contempt The youths of an elegant form  and ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service a doubtful situation which alternately exposed them to the favourable or cruel impulse of passion The useful mechanics and servants smiths carpenters taylors shoemakers cooks gardeners dyers and workmen in gold and silver c employed their skill for the use or profit of their master But the Roman captives who were destitute of art but capable of labour were condemned without regard to their former rank to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians The number of the hereditary bondsmen who were attached to the Gallic estates was continually increased by new supplies and the servile people according to the situation and temper of their lords was sometimes raised by precarious indulgence and more frequently depressed by capricious despotism  The state professions c of the German Italian and Gallic slaves during the middle ages are

kings might alienate their personal freedom and this act of legal suicide which was familiarly practised is expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity of human nature  Licentiam

render life desirable was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout who in times of public disorder pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves under the battlements of a powerful chief and around the shrine of a popular saint Their submission was accepted by these temporal or spiritual patrons and the hasty transaction irrecoverably fixed their own condition and that of their latest posterity From the reign of Clovis during five successive centuries the laws and manners of Gaul uniformly tended to promote the increase and to confirm the duration of personal servitude Time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate ranks of society and left an obscure and narrow interval between the noble and the slave This arbitrary and recent division has been transformed by pride and prejudice into a  national  distinction universally established by the arms and the laws of the Merovingians The nobles who claimed their genuine or fabulous descent from the independent  and victorious Franks have asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians to whom they imputed the imaginary disgrace of a Gallic or Roman extraction

resistance a victorious and catholic sovereign This  easy and valuable conquest was atchieved and possessed by Theodoric the eldest son of Clovis but the remote province was separated from his Austrasian dominions by the intermediate kingdoms of Soissons Paris and Orleans which formed after their father's death the inheritance of his three brothers The king of Paris Childebert was tempted

which rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures the sides of the hills were clothed with vines and each eminence was crowned with a villa or castle In the Lower Auvergne the river Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne and the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied and still supplies without any interval of repose the constant repetition of the same harvests  For the description of Auvergne see Sidonius l iv epist in tom i p with the notes of Savaron and Sirmond p and of their

the city and diocese of Auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris Childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory and  the free subjects of Theodoric threatened to desert his standard if he indulged his private resentment while the nation was engaged in the Burgundian war But the Franks of Austrasia soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of their king  "Follow me" said Thedoric "into Auvergne I will lead you into a province where you may acquire gold silver slaves cattle and precious apparel to the full extent of your wishes I repeat my promise I give you the people and their wealth as your prey and you may transport them at pleasure into your own country"  By the execution of this promise Theodoric justly forfeited the allegiance of a people whom he devoted to

lands within  the circle of its fortifications The Franks beheld with envy and despair this impregnable fortress but they surprised a party of fifty stragglers and as they were oppressed by the number of their captives they fixed at a trifling ransom the alternative of life or death for these wretched victims whom the cruel Barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the garrison Another detachment penetrated as far as Brivas or Brioude where the inhabitants with their valuable effects had taken refuge in the sanctuary of St Julian The doors of the church resisted the assault but a daring soldier entered through a window of the choir and opened a passage to his companions The clergy and people the sacred and the profane spoils were rudely torn from the altar and the sacrilegious division was made at a small distance from the town of Brioude But this act of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis He punished with death the most atrocious offenders left their secret accomplices to the vengeance of St Julian released the captives restored the plunder and extended the rights of sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr  See these

Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne  Story of Attalus  Theodoric exacted some pledges of the  future loyalty of a people whose just hatred could be restrained only by their fear A select band of noble youths the sons of the principal senators was delivered to the conqueror as the hostages of the faith of Childebert and of their countrymen On the first rumour of war or conspiracy these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of servitude and one of them Attalus  The story of Attalus is related by Gregory of Tours l iii c in tom ii p His editor the P Ruinart confounds this Attalus who was a youth  puer  in the year with a friend of Sidonius of the same name who was count of Autun fifty or sixty years before Such an error which cannot be imputed to ignorance is excused in some degree by its own magnitude  whose adventures are more particularly related kept his master's horses in the diocese of Treves After a painful search he was discovered in this unworthy occupation by the emissaries of his grandfather Gregory bishop of Langres but his offers of ransom were sternly rejected by the avarice of the Barbarian who required an exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble captive His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of Leo a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres  This Gregory the great grandfather of Gregory of Tours in tom ii p lived ninetytwo years of which he passed forty as count of Autun and thirtytwo as bishop of Langres According to the poet Fortunatus he displayed equal merit in these different stations  Nobilis antiquâ decurrens prole parentum  Nobilior gestis nunc super astramanet  Arbiter ante ferox dein pius ipse sacerdos  Quos domuit judex fovet amore patris  An unknown agent easily  introduced him into the same family The Barbarian purchased Leo for the price of twelve pieces of gold and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the luxury of an episcopal table  "Next Sunday" said the Frank "I shall invite my neighbours and kinsmen Exert thy art and force them to confess that they have never seen or tasted such an entertainment even in the king's house"  Leo assured him that if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry his wishes should be satisfied The master who already aspired to the merit of elegant hospitality assumed as his own the praise which the voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook and the dextrous Leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his household After the patient expectation of a whole year he cautiously whispered his design to Attalus and exhorted him to prepare for flight in the ensuing night At the hour of midnight the intemperate guests retired from table and the Frank's soninlaw whom Leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal potation condescended to jest on the facility with which he might betray his trust The intrepid slave after sustaining this dangerous raillery entered his master's bedchamber removed his spear and shield silently drew the fleetest horses from the stable unbarred the ponderous gates and excited Attalus to save his life and liberty by incessant diligence Their apprehensions urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the  Meuse  As M de Valois and the P Ruinart are determined to change the  Mosdla  of the text into  Mosa  it becomes me to acquiesce in the alteration Yet after some examination of the topography I could defend the common reading  they swam the river wandered three days in the adjacent forest and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild plumtree As they lay concealed in a dark thicket they heard the noise of horses they were terrified by the angry countenance of their master and they anxiously listened to his declaration that if he could seize the guilty fugitives one of them he would cut in pieces with his sword and would expose the other on a gibbet At length Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims who recruited their fainting strength with bread and wine concealed them from the search of their enemy and safely conducted them beyond the limits of the Austrasian kingdom to the episcopal palace of Langres Gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy gratefully delivered Leo with his whole family from the yoke of servitude and bestowed on him the property of a farm where he might end his days in happiness and freedom Perhaps this singular adventure which is marked with so many circumstances of truth and nature was related by Attalus himself to his cousin or nephew the first historian of the Franks Gregory of Tours  The parents of Gregory Gregorius Florentius Georgius were of noble extraction  natalibus illustres  and they possessed large estates  latifundia  both in Auvergne and Burgundy He was born in the year was consecrated bishop of Tours in and died in or soon after he had terminated his history See his Life by Odo abbot of Clugny in tom ii p and a new Life in the Memoires de l'Academie c tom xxvi p  was born  about sixty years after the death of Sidonius Apollinaris and their situation was almost similar since each of them was a native of Auvergne a senator and a bishop The difference of their style and sentiments may therefore express the decay of Gaul and clearly ascertain how much in so short a space the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement  Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus Gallicanis liberalium culturâ literarum c in praefat in tom ii p is the complaint of Gregory himself which he fully verifies by his own work His style is equally devoid of elegance and simplicity In a conspicuous station he still remained a stranger to his own age and country and in a prolix work the five last books contain ten years he has omitted almost every thing that posterity desires to learn I have tediously acquired by a painful perusal the right of pronouncing this unfavourable sentence    We are now qualified to despise the opposite  Privileges of the Romans of Gaul  and perhaps artful misrepresentations which have softened or exaggerated the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the Merovingians The conquerors never promulgated any  universal  edict of servitude or confiscation but a degenerate people who excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious Barbarians who contemptuously insulted their possessions their freedom and their safety Their personal injuries were partial and irregular but the great body of the Romans  survived the revolution and still preserved the property and privileges of citizens A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use of the Franks but they enjoyed the remainder exempt from tribute  The Abbé de Mably tom i p has diligently confirmed this opinion of the president de Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxx c  and the same irresistible violence which swept away the arts and manufactures of Gaul destroyed the elaborate and expensive system of Imperial despotism The Provincials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or Ripuarian laws but their private life in the important concerns of marriage testaments or inheritance was still regulated by the Theodosian Code and a discontented Roman might freely aspire or descend to the title and character of a Barbarian The honours of the state were accessible to his ambition the education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil government and as soon as emulation had rekindled their military ardour they were permitted to march in the ranks or even at the head of the victorious Germans I shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates whose names  See Dubos Hist Critique de la Monarchie Francoise tom ii l vi c The French antiquarians establish as a  principle  that the Romans and Barbarians may be distinguished by their names Their names undoubtedly form a reasonable  presumption  yet in reading Gregory of Tours I have observed Gondulphus of

successively entrusted to three Romans and the last and most powerful Mummolus  Eunius Mummolus is repeatedly mentioned by Gregory of Tours from the fourth c p to the seventh c p book The computation

supplanted his father in the station of count of Autun and left a treasure of thirty talents of gold and two hundred and fifty talents of silver The fierce and illiterate Barbarians were excluded during several generations from the dignities and even from the orders of the church  See Fleury Discours iii sur l'Histoire Ecclesiastique  The clergy of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native Provincials the haughty Franks fell prostrate at the feet of their subjects who were dignified with the episcopal character and the power and riches which had been lost in war were insensibly recovered by superstition  The bishop of Tours himself has recorded the complaint of Chilperic the grandson of Clovis Ecce pauper remansit Fiscus noster ecce divitiae nostrae ad ecclesias sunt translatae nulli penitus nisi soli Episcopi regnant l vi c in tom ii p  In all temporal affairs the Theodosian Code was the universal law of the clergy but the Barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety a subdeacon was equivalent to two Franks the  antrustion  and priest were held in similar estimation and the life of a bishop was appreciated far above the common  standard at the price of nine hundred pieces of gold  See the Ripuarian Code tit xxxvi in tom iv p The Salic law does not provide for the safety of the clergy and we might suppose on the behalf of the more civilized tribe that they had not foreseen such an impious act as the murder of a priest Yet Praetextatus archbishop of Rouen was assassinated by the order of queen Fredegundis before the altar Greg Turon l viii c in tom ii p  The Romans communicated to their conquerors the use of the Christian religion and Latin language  M Bonamy Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxiv p has ascertained the  Lingua Romana Rustica  which through the medium of the  Romance  has gradually been polished into the actual form of the French language Under the Carlovingian race the kings and nobles of France still understood the dialect of their German ancestors  but their language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity of the Augustan and Apostolic age The progress of superstition and Barbarism was rapid and universal the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the God of the Christians and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and pronunciation Yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory and the nations of Gaul were gradually confounded under the name and government of the Franks  The Franks after they mingled with their  Anarchy of the Franks  Gallic subjects might have imparted the most valuable of human gifts a spirit and system of constitutional liberty Under a king hereditary but limited the chiefs and counsellors  might have debated at Paris in the palace of the Caesars the adjacent field where the emperors reviewed their mercenary legions would have admitted the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors and the rude model which had been sketched in the woods of Germany  Ce beau systeme a été trouvé dans les bois Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xi c  might have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the Romans But the careless Barbarians secure of their personal independence disdained the labour of government the annual assemblies of the month of March were silently abolished and the nation was separated and almist dissolved by the conquest of Gaul  See the Abbé de Mably Observations c tom i p It should seem that the institution of national assemblies which are coeval with the French nation have never been congenial to its temper  The monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice of arms or of revenue The successors of Clovis wanted resolution to assume or strength to exercise the legislative and executive powers which the people had abdicated the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample privilege of rapine and murder and the love of freedom so often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition was reduced among the licentious Franks to the contempt of order and the desire of impunity Seventyfive years after the death of Clovis his grandson Gontran king of Burgundy sent an army to invade the Gothic possessions of Septimania or  Languedoc The troops of Burgundy Berry Auvergne and the adjacent territories were excited by the hopes of spoil They marched without discipline under the banners of German or Gallic counts their attack was feeble and unsuccessful but the friendly and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage The cornfields the villages the churches themselves were consumed by fire the inhabitants were massacred or dragged into captivity and in the disorderly retreat five thousand of these inhuman savages were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord When the pious Gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders and threatened to inflict not a legal sentence but instant and arbitrary execution they accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people  "No one" they said "any longer fears or respects his king his duke or his count Each man loves to do evil and freely indulges his criminal inclinations The most gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult and the rash magistrate who presumes to censure or restrain his seditious subjects seldom escapes alive from their revenge  Gregory of Tours l viii c in tom ii p relates with much indifference the crimes the reproof and the apology Nullus Regem metuit nullus Ducem nullus Comitem reveretur et si fortassis alicui ista displicent et ea pro longaevitate vitae vestrae emendare conatur statim seditio in populo statim tumultus

intemperate vices the most odious abuse of freedom and to supply its loss by the spirit of honour and humanity which now alleviates and dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign  The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the  The Visigoths of Spain  greatest part of their Gallic possessions but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest and secure enjoyment of the provinces of Spain From the monarchy of the Goths which soon involved the Suevic kingdom of Galicia the modern Spaniards still derive some national vanity but the historian of the Roman Empire is neither invited nor compelled to pursue the obscure and barren series of their annals  Spain in these dark ages has been peculiarly unfortunate The Franks had a Gregory of Tours the Saxons or Angles a Bede the Lombards a Paul Warnefrid c But the history of the Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect chronicles of Isidore of Seville and John of Biclar  The Goths of Spain were separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains their manners and institutions as far as they were common to the Germanic tribes have been already explained I have anticipated in the preceding chapter the most important of their ecclesiastical events the fall of Arianism and the persecution of the Jews and it only remains to observe some interesting circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the Spanish kingdom  After their conversion from idolatry or heresy  Legislative assemblies of Spain  the Franks and the Visigoths were disposed to  embrace with equal submission the inherent evils and the accidental benefits of superstition But the prelates of France long before the extinction of the Merovingian race had degenerated into fighting and hunting Barbarians They disdained the use of synods forgot the laws of temperance and chastity and preferred the indulgence of private ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal profession  Such are the complaints of St Boniface the apostle of Germany and the reformer of Gaul in tom iv p The fourscore years which he deplores of licence and corruption would seem to insinuate that the Barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the year  The bishops of Spain respected themselves and were respected by the public their indissoluble union disguised their vices and confirmed their authority and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace order and stability into the government of the state From the reign of Recared the first Catholic king to that of Witiza the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Roderic sixteen national councils were successively convened The six metropolitans Toledo Seville Merida Braga Tarragona and Narbonne presided according to their respective seniority the assembly was composed of their suffragan bishops who appeared in person or by their proxies and a place was assigned to the most holy or opulent of the Spanish abbots During the first three days of the convocation as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical questions of doctrine and discipline the profane laity was excluded from  their debates which were conducted however with decent solemnity But on the morning of the fourth day the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace the dukes and counts of the provinces the judges of the cities and the Gothic nobles and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the consent of the people The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies the annual synods which were empowered to hear complaints and to redress grievances and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the Spanish clergy The bishops who in each revolution were prepared to flatter the victorious and to insult the prostrate laboured with diligence and success to kindle the flames of persecution and to exalt the mitre above the crown Yet the national councils of Toledo in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal policy have established some prudent laws for the common benefit of the king and people The vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and Palatines and after the failure of the line of Alaric the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths The clergy who anointed their lawful prince always recommended and sometimes practised the duty of allegiance and the spiritual censures were denounced on the heads of the impious subjects who should resist his authority conspire against his life or violate by an indecent union the chastity even of his widow But the monarch  himself when he ascended the throne was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people that he would faithfully execute his important trust The real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the controul of a powerful aristocracy and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege that they should not be degraded imprisoned tortured nor punished with death exile or confiscation unless by the free and public judgment of their peers  The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the most authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain The following passages are particularly important iii iv v vi vii xiii I have found Mascou Hist of the ancient Germans xv and Annotations xxvi and xxxiii and Ferreras Hist Generale de l'Espagne tom ii very useful and accurate guides    One of these legislative councils of Toledo  Code of the Visigoths  examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings from the fierce Euric to the devout Egica As long as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors they indulged their subjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law Their gradual improvement in arts in policy and at length in religion encouraged them to imitate and to supersede these foreign institutions and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence for the use of a great and united people The same obligations and the same privileges were communicated to the nations of the Spanish monarchy and the conquerors insensibly renouncing  the Teutonic idiom submitted to the restraints of equity and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths The Provincials were long separated from their Arian masters by the irreconcilable difference of religion After the conversion of Recared had removed the prejudices of the Catholics the coasts both of the Ocean and Mediterranean were still possessed by the Eastern emperors who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the Barbarians and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by their own persuasion that they hazard more in a revolt than they can hope to obtain by a revolution but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation  The Code of the Visigoths regularly divided into twelve books has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet in tom iv p It has been treated by the president de Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxviii c with excessive severity I dislike the style I detest the superstition but I shall presume to think that the civil jurisprudence displays a more civilised and enlightened state of society than that of the Burgundians or even of the Lombards    While the kingdoms of the Franks and Visigoths  Revolution of Britain  were established in Gaul and Spain the Saxons atchieved the conquest of Britain the third great diocese of the Praefecture of the West Since Britain was already separated from the Roman  empire I might without reproach decline a story familiar to the most illiterate and obscure to the most learned of my readers The Saxons who excelled in the use of the oar or the battleaxe were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their exploits the Provincials relapsing into Barbarism neglected to describe the ruin of their country and the doubtful tradition was almost extinguished

sometimes embellished by the fancy of succeeding writers whose works I am not ambitious either to censure or to transcribe  The laborious Mr Carte and the ingenious Mr Whitaker are the two modern writers to whom I am principally indebted The particular historian of Manchester embraces under that obscure title a subject almost as extensive as the general history of England  Yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to pursue the revolutions of a Roman province till it vanishes from his sight and an Englishman may curiously trace the establishment of the Barbarians from whom he derives

countenance from the loose expressions of Gildas and Bede is framed into a regular story by Witikind a Saxon monk of the tenth century see Cousin Hist de l'Empire d'Occident tom ii p Rapin and even

Hengist  a formidable stranger to repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe His ambassadors are dispatched by the gravest historians to the coast of Germany they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly of the Saxons and those warlike Barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown island If Britain had indeed been unknown to the Saxons the measure of its calamities would have been less complete But the strength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime province against the pirates of Germany the independent and divided states were exposed to their attacks and the Saxons might sometimes join the Scots and the Picts in a tacit or express confederacy of rapine and destruction Vortigern could only balance the various perils which assaulted on every side his throne and his people and his policy may deserve either praise or excuse if he preferred the alliance of  those  Barbarians whose naval  power rendered them the most dangerous enemies and the most serviceable allies Hengist and Horsa as they ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships were engaged by the promise of an ample stipend to embrace the defence of Britain and their intrepid valour soon delivered the country from the Caledonian invaders The isle of Thanet a secure and fertile district was allotted for the residence of these German auxiliaries and they were supplied according to the treaty with a plentiful allowance of clothing and provisions This favourable reception encouraged five thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels and the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and seasonable reinforcement The crafty Barbarian suggested to Vortigern the obvious advantage of fixing in the neighbourhood of the Picts a colony of faithful allies a third fleet of forty ships under the command of his son and nephew sailed from Germany ravaged the Orkneys and disembarked a new army on the coast of Northumberland or Lothian at the opposite extremity of the devoted land It was easy to foresee but it was impossible to prevent the impending evils The two nations were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies The Saxons magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an ungrateful people while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcileable quarrel The Saxons flew to arms and  if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a feast the destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains the intercourse of peace and war  Nennius imputes to the Saxons the murder of three hundred British chiefs a crime not unsuitable to their savage manners But we are not obliged to believe see Jeffrey of Monmouth l viii c that Stonehenge is their monument which the giants had formerly transported from Africa to Ireland and which was removed to Britain by the order of Ambrosius and the art of Merlin    Hengist who boldly aspired to the conquest of  Establishment of the Saxon heptarchy A D  Britain exhorted his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity he painted in lively colours the fertility of the soil the wealth of the cities the pusillanimous temper of the natives and the convenient situation of a spacious solitary island accessible on all sides to the Saxon fleets The successive colonies which issued in the period of a century from the mouths of the Elbe the Weser and the Rhine were principally composed of three valiant tribes or nations of Germany the  Jutes  the  old Saxons  and the  Angles  The Jutes who fought under the peculiar banner of Hengist assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory and of erecting in Kent the first independent kingdom The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive Saxons and the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people which at the end of four hundred years produced the first monarchs of South Britain The Angles were distinguished by their numbers and their success  and they claimed the honour of fixing a perpetual name on the country of which they occupied the most ample portion The Barbarians who followed the hopes of rapine either on the land or sea were insensibly blended with this triple confederacy the  Frisians  who had been tempted by their vicinity to the British shores might balance during a short space the strength and reputation of the native Saxons the  Danes  the  Prussians  the  Rugians  are faintly described and some adventurous  Huns  who had wandered as far as the Baltic might embark on board the German vessels for the conquest of a new world  All these tribes are expressly enumerated by Bede l i c p l v c p and though I have considered Mr Whitaker's remarks Hist of Manchester vol ii p I do not perceive the absurdity of supposing that the Frisians c were mingled with the AngloSaxons  But this arduous atchievement was not prepared or executed by the union of national powers Each intrepid chieftain according to the measure of his fame and fortunes assembled his followers equipped a fleet of three or perhaps of sixty vessels chose the place of the attack and conducted his subsequent operations according to the events of the war and the dictates of his private interest In the invasion of Britain many heroes vanquished and fell but only seven victorious leaders assumed or at least maintained the title of kings Seven independent thrones the Saxon Heptarchy were founded by the conquerors and seven families one of which has been continued by female succession to our present sovereign derived their equal and sacred lineage from  Woden the god of war It has been pretended that this republic of kings was moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate But such an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and turbulent spirit of the Saxons their laws are silent and their imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody prospect of intestine discord  Bede has enumerated seven kings two Saxons a Jute and four Angles who successively acquired in the heptarchy an indefinite supremacy of power and renown But their reign was the effect not of law but of conquest and he observes in similar terms that one of them subdued the Isles of Man and Anglesey and that another imposed a tribute on the Scots and Picts Hist Eccles l ii c p    A monk who in the profound ignorance of  State of the Britons  human life has presumed to exercise the office of historian strangely disfigures the state of Britain at the time of its separation from the Western empire Gildas  See Gildas de Excidio Britanniae c i p edit Gale  describes in florid language the improvements of agriculture the foreign trade which flowed with every tide into the Thames and the Severn the solid and lofty construction of public and private edifices he accuses the sinful luxury of the British people of a people according to the same writer ignorant of the most simple arts and incapable without the aid of the Romans of providing walls of stone or weapons of iron for the defence of their native land  Mr Whitaker History of Manchester vol ii p has smartly exposed this glaring absurdity which had passed unnoticed by the general historians as they were hastening to more interesting and important events  Under the long dominion of the emperors Britain  had been insensibly moulded into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province whose safety was entrusted to a foreign power The subjects of Honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill or courage or authority to direct the public force against the common enemy The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakness and degraded the character both of the prince and people Their consternation magnified the danger the want of union diminished their resources and the madness of civil factions was more solicitous to accuse than to remedy the evils which they imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries Yet the Britons were not ignorant they could not be ignorant of the manufacture or the use of arms the successive and disorderly attacks of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their amazement and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience to their native valour  While the continent of Europe and Africa  Their resistance  yielded without resistance to the Barbarians the British island alone and unaided maintained a long a vigorous though an unsuccessful struggle against the formidable pirates who almost at the same instant assaulted the Northern the Eastern and the Southern coasts The cities which had been fortified with skill were defended with resolution the advantages of ground hills  forests and morasses were diligently improved by the inhabitants the conquest of each district was purchased with blood and the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence of their annalist Hengist might hope to atchieve the conquest of Britain but his ambition in an active reign of thirtyfive years was confined to the possession of Kent and the numerous colony which he had planted in the North was extirpated by the sword of the Britons The monarchy of the WestSaxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of three martial generations The life of Cerdic one of the bravest of the children of Woden was consumed in the conquest of Hampshire and the isle of Wight and the loss which he sustained in the battle of Mount Badon reduced him to a state of inglorious repose Kenric his valiant son advanced into Wiltshire besieged Salisbury at that time seated on a commanding eminence and vanquished an

might consult some materials that no longer exist  his British enemies displayed their military science Their troops were formed in three lines each line consisted of three distinct bodies and the cavalry the archers and the pikemen were distributed  according to the principles of Roman tactics The Saxons charged in one weighty column boldly encountered with their short swords the long lances of the Britons and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night Two decisive victories the death of three British kings and the reduction of Cirencester Bath and Gloucester established the fame and power of Ceaulin the grandson of Cerdic who carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn  After a war of an hundred years the independent  and flight  Britons still occupied the whole extent of the Western coast from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme promontory of Cornwall and the principal cities of the inland country still opposed the arms of the Barbarians Resistance became more languid as the number and boldness of the assailants continually increased Winning their way by slow and painful efforts the Saxons the Angles and their various confederates advanced from the North from the East and from the South till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the island Beyond the Severn the Britons still asserted their national freedom which survived the heptarchy and even the monarchy of the Saxons The bravest warriors who preferred exile to slavery found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales the reluctant submission of Cornwall was delayed for some ages  Cornwall was finally subdued by Athelstan A D who planted an English colony at Exeter and confined the Britons beyond the river Tamar See William of Malmsbury l ii in the Scriptores post Bedam p The spirit of the Cornish knights was degraded by servitude and it should seem from the Romance of Sir Tristram that their cowardice was almost proverbial  and a  band of fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul by their own valour or the liberality of the Merovingian kings  The establishment of the Britons in Gaul is proved in the sixth century by Procopius Gregory of Tours the second council of Tours A D and the least suspicious of their chronicles and lives of saints The subscription of a bishop of the Britons to the first council of Tours A D or rather the army of Riothamus and the loose declamation of Gildas alii transmarinas petebant regiones c p may countenance an emigration as early as the middle of the fifth century Beyond that aera the Britons of Armorica can be found only in romance and I am surprized that Mr Whitaker Genuine History of the Britons p should so faithfully transcribe the gross ignorance of Carte whose venial errors he has so rigorously chastised  The Western angle of Armorica acquired the new appellations of  Cornwall  and the  Lesser Britain  and the vacant lands of the Osismii were filled by a strange people who under the authority of their counts and bishops preserved the laws and language of their ancestors To the feeble descendants of Clovis and Charlemagne the Britons of Armorica refused the customary tribute subdued the neighbouring dioceses of Vannes Rennes and Nantes and formed a powerful though vassal state which has been united to the crown of France  The antiquities of  Bretagne  which have been the subject even of political

 if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion we need not repine since every age however destitute of science or virtue sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown The tomb of Vortimer the son of Vortigern was erected on the margin of the seashore as a landmark formidable to the Saxons whom he had thrice vanquished in the fields of Kent Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a noble family of Romans  Bede who in his chronicle p places Ambrosius under the reign of Zeno A D observes that his parents had been "purpurâ induti" which he explains in his ecclesiastical history by "regium nomen et insigne ferentibus" l i c p The expression of Nennius c p edit Gale is still more singular "Unus de  consulibus  gentis Romanicae est pater meus"  his

life and five thousand of his subjects in a battle against Cerdic the West Saxon Chron Saxon p  was crowned with splendid success But every British name is effaced by the illustrious name of ARTHUR  As I am a stranger to the Welsh bards Myrdhin Llomarch and Taliessin my faith in the existence and exploits of Arthur principally rests on the simple and circumstantial testimony of Nennius Hist Brit c p Mr Whitaker Hist of Manchester vol ii p has framed an interesting and even probable narrative of the wars of Arthur though it is impossible to allow the reality of the round table  the hereditary prince of the Silures in South Wales and the elective king or general of the nation According to the most rational account  he defeated in twelve successive battles the Angles of the North and the Saxons of the West but the declining age of the hero was embittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes The events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions of his fame During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved and rudely embellished by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica who were odious to the Saxons and unknown to the rest of mankind The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to enquire into the ancient history of Britain they listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons their common enemies His romance transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the times was enriched with the various though incoherent ornaments which were familiar to the experience the learning or the fancy of the twelfth century The progress of a Phrygian colony from the Tyber to the Thames was easily engrafted on the fable of the Aeneid and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy and claimed their alliance with the Caesars His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and Imperial titles and his Danish victories avenged the recent injuries of his country The gallantry and superstition of the British hero his feasts and tournaments and the memorable institution of  his Knights of the  Round Table  were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry and the fabulous exploits of Uther's son appear less incredible than the adventures which were atchieved by the enterprising valour of the Normans Pilgrimage and the holy wars introduced into Europe the specious miracles of Arabian magic Fairies and giants flying dragons and enchanted palaces were blended with the more simple sictions of the West and the fate of Britain depended on the art or the predictions of Merlin Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy and the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity At length the light of science and reason was rekindled the talisman was broken the visionary fabric melted into air and by a natural though unjust reverse of the public opinion the severity of the present age is inclined to question the  existence  of Arthur  The progress of romance and the state of learning in the middle ages are illustrated by Mr Thomas Wharton with the taste of a poet and the minute diligence of an antiquarian I have derived much instruction from the two learned dissertations prefixed to the first volume of his History of English Poetry    Resistance if it cannot avert must increase the  Desolation of Britain  miseries of conquest and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons who hated the valour of  their enemies disdained the faith of treaties and violated without remorse the most sacred objects of the Christian worship The fields of battle might be traced almost in every district by monuments of bones the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood the last of the Britons without distinction of age or sex was massacred  Hoc anno Aella et Cissa obsederunt AndredesCeaster et interfecerunt omnes qui id incoluerunt adeo ut ne unus Brito ibi superstes fuerit Chron Saxon p an expression more dreadful in its simplicity than all the vague and tedious lamentations of the British Jeremiah  in the ruins of Anderida  AndredesCeaster or Anderida is placed by Cambden Britannia vol i p at Newenden in the marshy grounds of Kent which might be formerly covered by the sea and on the edge of the great forest Anderida which overspread so large a portion of Hampshire and Sussex  and the repetition of such calamities was frequent and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy The arts and religion the laws and language which the Romans had so carefully planted in Britain were extirpated by their barbarous successors After the destruction of the principal churches the bishops who had declined the crown of martyrdom retired with the holy relics into Wales and Armorica the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food the practice and even the remembrance of Christianity were abolished and the British clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers The kings of France maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects but the ferocious Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome and of the emperors The proceedings  of civil and criminal jurisdiction the titles of honour the forms of office the ranks of society and even the domestic rights of marriage testament and inheritance were finally suppressed and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of Germany The language of science of business and of conversation which had been introduced by the Romans was lost in the general desolation A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic words might be assumed by the Germans to express their new wants and ideas  Dr Johnson affirms that  few  English words are of British extraction Mr Whitaker who understands the British language has discovered more than  three thousand  and actually produces a long and various catalogue vol ii p It is possible indeed that many of these words may have been imported from the Latin or Saxon into the native idiom of Britain  but those  illiterate  Pagans preserved and established the use of their national dialect  In the beginning of the seventh century the Franks and the AngloSaxons mutually understood each other's language which was derived from the same Teutonic root Bede l i c p  Almost every name conspicuous either in the church or state reveals its Teutonic origin  After the first generation of Italian or Scottish missionaries the dignities of the church were filled with Saxon proselytes  and the geography of  England  was universally inscribed with foreign characters and appellations The example of a revolution so rapid and so complete may not easily be found but it will excite a probable suspicion that the arts of Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain and that the native  rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners  This strange alteration has persuaded historians  Servitude  and even philosophers that the provincials of Britain were totally exterminated and that the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx and rapid increase of the German colonies Three hundred thousand Saxons are  said  to have obeyed the summons of Hengist  Carte's History of England vol i p He quotes the British historians but I much fear that Jeffrey of Monmouth l vi c is his only witness  the entire emigration of the Angles was attested in the age of Bede by the solitude of their native country  Bede Hist Ecclesiast l i c p The fact is probable and well attested yet such was the loose intermixture of the German tribes that we find in a subsequent period the law of the Angli and Warini of Germany Lindenbrog Codex p  and our experience has shewn the free propagation of the human race if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness where their steps are unconfined and their subsistence is plentiful The Saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation the towns were small the villages were distant the husbandry was languid and unskilful four sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land  See Dr Henry's useful and laborious History of Great Britain vol ii p  an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature and the modern bishopric of Durham the whole territory from the Tyne to the Tees had returned to its primitive state of a savage and solitary  forest  Quicquid says John of Tinemouth inter Tynam et Tesam fluvios extitit sola eremi vastitudo tunc temporis fuit et idcirco nullius ditioni servivit eo quod sola indomitorum et sylvestrium animalium spelunca et habitatio fuit apud Carte vol i p From bishop Nicholson English Historical Library p I understand that fair copies of John of Tinemouth's ample Collections are preserved in the libraries of Oxford Lambeth c  Such imperfect population might have been supplied in some generations by the English colonies but neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition that the Saxons of Britain remained alone in the desert which they had subdued After the sanguinary Barbarians had secured their dominion and gratified their revenge it was their interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle of the unresisting country In each successive revolution the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters and the salutary compact of food and labour is silently ratified by their mutual necessities Wilfrid the apostle of Sussex  See the mission of Wilfrid c in Bede Hist Eccles l iv c p  accepted from his royal convert the gift of the peninsula of Selsey near Chichester with the persons and property of its inhabitants who then amounted to eightyseven families He released them at once from spiritual and temporal bondage and two hundred and fifty slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master The kingdom of Sussex which spread from the sea to the Thames contained seven thousand families twelve hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight and if we multiply this vague computation it may  seem probable that England was cultivated by a million of servants or  villains  who were attached to the estates of their arbitrary landlords The indigent Barbarians were often tempted to sell their children or themselves into perpetual and even foreign bondage  From the concurrent testimony of Bede l ii c p and William of Malmsbury l iii p it appears that the AngloSaxons from the first to the last age persisted in this unnatural practice Their youths were publicly sold in the market of Rome  yet the special exemptions which were granted to  national  slaves  According to the laws of Ina they could not be lawfully sold beyond the seas  sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous than the strangers and captives who had lost their liberty or changed their masters by the accidents of war When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of the AngloSaxons the laws encouraged the frequent practice of manumission and their subjects of Welsh or Cambrian extraction assume the respectable station of inferior freemen possessed of lands and intitled to the rights of civil society  The life of a  Wallus  or  Cambricus homo  who possessed a hyde of land is fixed at shillings by the same laws of Ina tit xxxii in Leg AngloSaxon p which allowed shillings for a free Saxon and for a Thane see likewise Leg AngloSaxon p We may observe that these legislators the WestSaxons and Mercians continued their British conquests after they became Christians The laws of the four kings of Kent do not condescend to notice the existence of any subject Britons  Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales and Cornwall The sage Ina the legislator of Wessex united the two nations  in the bands of domestic alliance and four British lords of Somersetshire may be honourably distinguished in the court of a Saxon monarch  See Carte's Hist of England vol i p    The independent Britons appear to have relapsed  Manners of the Britons  into the state of original barbarism from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the Catholic world  At the conclusion of his history A D Bede describes the ecclesiastical state of the island and censures the implacable though impotent hatred of the Britons against the English nation and the Catholic church l v c p  Christianity was still professed in the mountains of Wales but the rude schismatics in the  form  of the clerical tonsure and in the  day  of the celebration of Easter obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the Roman pontiffs The use of the Latin language was insensibly abolished and the Britons were deprived of the arts and learning which Italy communicated to her Saxon proselytes In Wales and Armorica the Celtic tongue the native idiom of the West was preserved and propagated and the  Bards  who had been the companions of the Druids were still protected in the sixteenth century by the laws of Elizabeth Their chief a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern or Aberfraw or Caermathaen accompanied the king's servants to war the monarchy of the Britons which he sung in the front of battle excited their courage and justified their depredations  and the songster claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil His subordinate ministers the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music visited in their respective circuits the royal the noble and the plebeian houses and the public poverty almost exhausted by the clergy was oppressed by the importunate demands of the bards Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet and of his audience  Mr Pennant's Tour in Wales p has furnished me with a curious and interesting account of the Welsh bards In the year a session was held at Caerwys by the special command of queen Elizabeth and regular degrees in vocal and instrumental music were conferred on fiftyfive minstrels The prize a silver harp was adjudged by the Mostyn family  The last retreats of Celtic freedom the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain were less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage the wealth of the Britons consisted in their flocks and herds milk and flesh were their ordinary food and bread was sometimes esteemed or rejected as a foreign luxury Liberty had peopled the mountains of Wales and the morasses of Armorica but their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to contain ten wives and perhaps fifty children  Regio longe lateque diffusa

eloquence to the Romans the French and the Britons The malicious Welshman insinuates that the English taciturnity might possibly be the effect of their servitude under the Normans  and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war The cavalry of Armorica the spearmen of Gwent and the archers of Merioneth were equally formidable but their poverty could seldom procure either shields or helmets and the inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations One of the greatest of the English monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a Greek emperor concerning the state of Britain and Henry II could assert from his personal experience that Wales was inhabited by a race of naked

confounded by the wonders which he relates that he weakly attempts to distinguish the islands of  Brittia  and  Britain  which he has identified by so many inseparable circumstances  describes the wonders of a remote isle whose eastern and western parts are divided by an antique wall the boundary of life and death or more properly of truth and fiction The east is a fair country inhabited by a civilised people the air is healthy the waters are pure and plentiful and the earth yields her regular and fruitful increase In the west beyond the wall the air is infectious and mortal the ground is covered with serpents and this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits who are transported from the opposite shores in substantial boats and by living rowers Some families of fishermen the subjects of the Franks are excused from tribute in consideration of the mysterious office which is performed by these Charons of the ocean Each in his turn is summoned at the hour of midnight to hear the voices and even the names of the ghosts he is sensible of their weight and he feels himself impelled by an unknown but irresistible power After this dream of fancy we read with astonishment that the name of this island is  Brittia  that it lies in the ocean against the mouth of the Rhine and less than thirty miles from the continent that it is possessed by three nations the Frisians the Angles and the Britons and that some Angles had appeared at Constantinople in  the train of the French ambassadors From these ambassadors Procopius might be informed of a singular though not improbable adventure which announces the spirit rather than the delicacy of an English heroine She had been betrothed to Radiger king of the Varni a tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine but the perfidious lover was tempted by motives of policy to prefer his father's widow the sister of Theodebert king of the Franks  Theodebert grandson of Clovis and king of Austrasia was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age and this remarkable adventure may be placed between the years and the extreme terms of his reign His sister Theudechildis retired to Sens where she founded monasteries and distributed alms see the notes of the Benedictine editors in tom ii p If we may credit the praises of Fortunatus l vi carm in tom ii p Radiger was deprived of a most valuable wife  The forsaken princess of the Angles instead of bewailing revenged her disgrace Her warlike subjects are  said  to have been ignorant of the use and even of the form of an horse but she boldly sailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine with a fleet of four hundred ships and an army of one hundred thousand men After the loss of a battle the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride who generously pardoned his offence dismissed her rival and compelled the king of the Varni to discharge with honour and fidelity the duties of an husband  Perhaps she was the sister of one of the princes or chiefs of the Angles who landed in and the following years between the Humber and the Thames and gradually founded the kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia The English writers are ignorant of her name and existence but Procopius may have suggested to Mr Rowe the character and situation of Rodugune in the tragedy of the Royal Convert  This gallant exploit appears to be the  last naval enterprise of the AngloSaxons The arts of navigation by which they had acquired the empire of Britain and of the sea were soon neglected by the indolent Barbarians who supinely renounced all the commercial advantages of their insular situation Seven independent kingdoms were agitated by perpetual discord and the  British world  was seldom connected either in peace or war with the nations of the continent  In the copious history of Gregory of Tours we cannot find any traces of hostile or friendly intercourse between France and England except in the marriage of the daughter of Caribert king of Paris quam regis  cujusdam  in Cantia filius matrimonio copulavit l ix c in tom ii p The bishop of Tours ended his history and his life almost immediately before the conversion of Kent    I have now accomplished the laborious narrative  Fall of the Roman empire in the West  of the decline and fall of the Roman empire from the fortunate age of Trajan and the Antonines to its total extinction in the West about five centuries after the Christian aera At that unhappy period the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession of Britain Gaul and Spain were divided between the powerful monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths and the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians Africa was exposed to the cruel persecution of the Vandals and the savage insults of the Moors Rome and Italy as far as the banks  of the Danube were afflicted by an army of Barbarian mercenaries whose lawless tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth All the subjects of the empire who by the use of the Latin language more particularly deserved the name and privileges of Romans were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign conquest and the victorious nations of Germany established a new system of manners and government in the western countries of Europe The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by the princes of Constantinople the feeble and imaginary successors of Augustus Yet they continued to reign over the East from the Danube to the Nile and Tigris the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa were subverted by the arms of Justinian and the history of the  Greek  emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons and interesting revolutions  General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West  THE Greeks after their country had been reduced into a province imputed the triumphs of Rome not to the merit but to the FORTUNE of the republic The inconstant goddess who so blindly distributes and resumes her favours had  now  consented such was the language of envious flattery to resign her wings to descend from her globe and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber  Such are the figurative expressions of Plutarch Opera tom ii p edit Wechel to whom on the faith of his son Lamprias Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom iii p I shall boldly impute the malicious declamation  The same opinions had prevailed among the Greeks two hundred and fifty years before Plutarch and to confute them is the professed intention of Polybius Hist l i p edit Gronov Amstel  A wiser Greek who has composed with a philosophic spirit the memorable history of his own times deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of Rome  See the inestimable remains of the sixth book of Polybius and many other parts of his general history particularly a digression in the seventeenth book in which he compares the phalanx and the legion  The fidelity of the citizens to each other and to the state was confirmed by the habits of education and the prejudices of religion Honour as well as virtue was the principle of the republic the ambitious citizens laboured to deserve the solemn  glories of a triumph and the ardour of the Roman youth was kindled into active emulation as often as they beheld the domestic images of their ancestors  Sallust de Bell Jugurthin c Such were the generous professions of P Scipio and Q Maximus The Latin historian had read and most probably transcribes Polybius their contemporary and friend  The temperate struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution which united the freedom of popular assemblies with the authority and wisdom of a senate and the executive powers of a regal magistrate When the consul displayed the standard of the republic each citizen bound himself by the obligation of an oath to draw his sword in the cause of his country till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military service of ten years This wise institution continually poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and soldiers and their numbers were reinforced by the warlike and populous states of Italy who after a brave resistance had yielded to the valour and embraced the alliance of the Romans The sage historian who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio and beheld the ruin of Carthage  While Carthage was in flames Scipio repeated two lines of the Iliad which express the destruction of Troy acknowledging to Polybius his friend and preceptor Polyb in Excerpt de Virtut et Vit tom ii p that while he recollected the vicissitudes of human affairs he inwardly applied them to the future calamities of Rome Appian in Libycis p edit Toll  has accurately described their military system their levies arms exercises subordination marches encampments  and the invincible legion superior in active strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander From these institutions of peace and war Polybius has deduced the spirit and success of a people incapable of fear and impatient of repose The ambitious design of conquest which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of mankind was attempted and atchieved and the perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence and courage The arms of the republic sometimes vanquished in battle always victorious in war advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates the Danube the Rhine and the Ocean and the images of gold or silver or brass that might serve to represent the nations and their kings were successively broken by the  iron  monarchy of Rome  See Daniel ii  "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as  iron  forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things"  The remainder of the prophecy the mixture of iron and  clay  was accomplished according to St Jerom in his own  ime Sicut enim in principio nihil Romano Imperio fortius et durius ita in sine rerum nihil imbecillius quum et in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes aliarum gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus Opera tom v p    The rise of a city which swelled into an empire may deserve as a singular prodigy the reflection of a philosophic mind But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness Prosperity ripened the principle of decay the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial  supports the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight The story of its ruin is simple and obvious and instead of enquiring  why  the Roman empire was destroyed we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long The victorious legions who in distant wars acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries first oppressed the freedom of the republic and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple The emperors anxious for their personal safety and the public peace were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy the vigour of the military government was relaxed and finally dissolved by the partial institutions of Constantine and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians  The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation of the seat of empire but this history has already shewn that the powers of government were  divided  rather than  removed  The throne of Constantinople was erected in the East while the West was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in Italy and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces This dangerous novelty impaired the strength and fomented the vices of a double reign the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were multiplied and a vain emulation of luxury not of merit was introduced and supported between the degenerate  successors of Theodosius Extreme distress which unites the virtue of a free people embitters the factions of a declining monarchy The hostile favourites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies and the Byzantine court beheld with indifference perhaps with pleasure the disgrace of Rome the misfortunes of Italy and the loss of the West Under the succeeding reigns the alliance of the two empires was restored but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy doubtful and ineffectual and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners of interest and even of religion Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of Constantine During a long period of decay his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians protected the wealth of Asia and commanded both in peace and war the important streights which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean seas The foundation of Constantinople more essentially contributed to the preservation of the East than to the ruin of the West  As the happiness of a  future  life is the great object of religion we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction or at least the abuse of Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity the active virtues of society were discouraged and the last remains  of military spirit were buried in the cloyster a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion and the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity Faith zeal curiosity and the more earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the flame of theological discord the church and even the state were distracted by religious factions whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country Yet partyspirit however pernicious or absurd is a principle of union as well as of dissention The bishops from eighteen hundred pulpits inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches and the benevolent temper of the gospel was strengthened though confined by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert from baser motives the standard of the republic Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations  of their votaries but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial though imperfect effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the North If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors  This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of the present age It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views and to consider Europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants have attained almost the same level of politeness and cultivation The balance of power will continue to fluctuate and the prosperity of our own or the neighbouring kingdoms may be alternately exalted or depressed but these partial events cannot essentially injure our general state of happiness the system of arts and laws and manners which so advantageously distinguish above the rest of mankind the Europeans and their colonies The savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilised society and we may inquire with anxious curiosity whether Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire and explain the probable causes of our actual security  I The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger and the number of their enemies Beyond the Rhine and Danube the northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds poor voracious and turbulent bold in arms and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of China The Huns who fled before a victorious enemy directed their march towards the West and the torrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in  their  turn the spirit of conquest the endless column of Barbarians pressed on the Roman empire with accumulated weight and if the foremost were destroyed the vacant space was instantly replenished by new assailants Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from the North and the long repose which has been imputed to the decrease of population is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture Instead of some rude villages thinly scattered among its woods and morasses Germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns the Christian kingdoms of Denmark Sweden and Poland have been successively established and the Hanse merchants with the Teutonic knights have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic as far as the Gulf of Finland From  the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern Ocean Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilised empire The plough the loom and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga the Oby and the Lena and the fiercest of the Tartar hords have been taught to tremble and obey The reign of independent Barbarism is now contracted to a narrow span and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks whose forces may be almost numbered cannot seriously excite the apprehensions of the great republic of Europe  The French and English editors of the Genealogical History of the Tartars have subjoined a curious though imperfect description of their present state We might question the independence of the Calmucks or Eluths since they have been recently vanquished by the Chinese who in the year subdued the lesser Bucharia and advanced into the country of Badakshan near the sources of the Oxus Memoires sur les Chinois tom i p But these conquests are precarious nor will I venture to ensure the safety of the Chinese empire  Yet this apparent security should not tempt us to forget that new enemies and unknown dangers may  possibly  arise from some obscure people scarcely visible in the map of the world The Arabs or Saracens who spread their conquests from India to Sapin had languished in poverty and contempt till Mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm  II The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalition of its members The subject nations resigning the hope and even the wish of independence embraced the character of Roman citizens and the provinces of the West were reluctantly torn by the  Barbarians from the bosom of their mothercountry  The prudent reader will determine how far this general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians the independence of Britain and Armorica the Moorish tribes or the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain vol i p vol iii p  But this union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit and the servile provinces destitute of life and motion expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors who were directed by the orders of a distant court The happiness of an hundred millions depended on the personal merit of one or two men perhaps children whose minds were corrupted by education luxury and despotic power The deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons and grandsons of Theodosius and after those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood they abandoned the church to the bishops the state to the eunuchs and the provinces to the Barbarians Europe is now divided into twelve powerful though unequal kingdoms three respectable commonwealths and a variety of smaller though independent states the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied at least with the number of its rulers and a Julian or Semiramis may reign in the North while Arcadius and Honorius again slumber on the thrones of the South The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame republics have acquired order and stability monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom  or at least of moderation and some sense of honour and justice is introduced into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times In peace the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of so many active rivals in war the European forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests If a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia the numerous armies of Germany the gallant nobles of France and the intrepid freemen of Britain who perhaps might confederate for their common defence Should the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of civilised society and Europe would revive and flourish in the American world which is already filled with her colonies and institutions  America now contains about six millions of European blood and descent and their numbers at least in the North are continually increasing Whatever may be the changes of their political situation they must preserve the manners of Europe and we may reflect with some pleasure that the English language will probably be diffused over an immense and populous continent    III Cold poverty and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the strength and courage of Barbarians In every age they have oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China India and Persia who neglected and still neglect to counterbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art The warlike states of antiquity  Greece Macedonia and Rome educated a race of soldiers exercised their bodies disciplined their courage multiplied their forces by regular evolutions and converted the iron which they possessed into strong and serviceable weapons But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and manners and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successors armed and instructed for the ruin of the empire the rude valour of the Barbarian mercenaries The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature air and fire Mathematics chymistry mechanics architecture have been applied to the service of war and the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of attack and of defence Historians may indignantly observe that the preparations of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony  On avoit fait venir for the siege of Turin pieces de canon et il est à remarquer que chaque gros canon monté revient à environ ecus il y avoit boulets cartouches d'une façon et d'une autre bombes grenades facs à terre instrumens pour le pionnage livres de poudre Ajoutez à ces munitions le plomb le fer et le ferblanc les cordages tout ce qui ser aux mineurs le souphre le salpêtre les outils de toute espece Il est certain que les frais de tous ces préparatiss de destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus nombreuse colonie Voltaire Siécle de Louis XIV c xx in his Works tom xi p  yet we cannot be displeased that the subversion of a city should be a work of cost and difficulty or that an industrious people should be protected by those arts which survive  and supply the decay of military virtue Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse and Europe is secure from any future irruption of Barbarians since before they can conquer they must cease to be barbarous Their gradual advances in the science of war would always be accompanied as we may learn from the example of Russia with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy and they themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom they subdue  Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious there still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope The discoveries of ancient and modern navigators and the domestic history or tradition of the most enlightened nations represent the  human savage  naked both in mind and body and destitute of laws of arts of ideas and almost of language  It would be an easy though tedious task to produce the authorities of poets philosophers and historians I shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of Diodorus Siculus tom i l i p l iii p c edit Wesseling The Icthyophagi who in his time wandered along the shores of the Red Sea can only be compared to the natives of New Holland Dampier's Voyages vol i p Fancy or perhaps reason may still suppose an extreme and absolute state of nature far below the level of these savages who had acquired some arts and instruments  From this abject condition perhaps the primitive and universal state of man he has gradually arisen to command the animals to fertilise the earth to traverse the ocean and to measure the  heavens His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and corporeal faculties  See the learned and rational work of the President Goguet de l'Origine des Loix des Arts et des Sciences He traces from facts or conjectures tom i p edit mo the first and most difficult steps of human invention  has been irregular and various infinitely slow in the beginning and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid downfal and the several climates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness Yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes and diminish our apprehensions we cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their advances towards perfection but it may safely be presumed that no people unless the face of nature is changed will relapse into their original barbarism The improvements of society may be viewed under a threefold aspect The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and country by the efforts of a  single  mind but these superior powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions and the genius of Homer or Cicero or Newton would excite less admiration if they could be created by the will of a prince or the lessons of a preceptor The benefits of law and policy of trade and manufactures of arts and sciences are more solid and permanent and  many  individuals may be qualified by education and discipline to promote in their respective stations the interest of the community  But this general order is the effect of skill and labour and the complex machinery may be decayed by time or injured by violence Fortunately for mankind the more useful or at least more necessary arts can be performed without superior talents or national subordination without the powers of  one  or the union of  many  Each village each family each individual must always possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of fire  It is certain however strange that many nations have been ignorant of the use of fire Even the ingenious natives of Otaheite who are destitute of metals have not invented any earthen vessels capable of sustaining the action of fire and of communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain  and of metals the propagation and service of domestic animals the methods of hunting and fishing the rudiments of navigation the imperfect cultivation of corn or other nutritive grain and the simple practice of the mechanic trades Private genius and public industry may be extirtirpated but these hardy plants survive the tempest and strike an everlasting root into the most unfavourable soil The splendid days of Augustus and Trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance and the Barbarians subverted the laws and palaces of Rome But the scythe the invention or emblem of Saturn  Plutarch Quaest Rom in tom ii p Macrob Saturnal l i c p edit London The arrival of Saturn of his religious worship in a ship may indicate that the savage coast of Latium was first discovered and civilised by the Phoenicians  still continued annually to mow the harvests of Italy  and the human feasts of the Laestrigons  In the ninth and tenth books of the Odyssey Homer has embellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors who transformed the cannibals of Italy and Sicily into monstrous giants  have never been renewed on the coast of Campania  Since the first discovery of the arts war commerce and religious zeal have diffused among the savages of the Old and New World these inestimable gifts they have been successively propagated they can never be lost We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age of the world has increased and still increases the real wealth the happiness the knowledge and perhaps the virtue of the human race  The merit of discovery has too often been stained with avarice cruelty and fanaticism and the intercourse of nations has produced the communication of disease and prejudice A singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country The five great voyages successively undertaken by the command of his present Majesty were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of mankind The same prince adapting his benefactions to the different stages of society has founded a school of painting in his capital and has introduced into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and animals most useful to human life    END OF THE SIXTH VOLUME
