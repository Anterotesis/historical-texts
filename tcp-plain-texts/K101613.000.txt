The Scene discovers  APOLLO  and the  NINE MUS  in their proper Habits  APOLLO  FATE gave the Word the Deed is done  AUGUSTUS is no more  His great Career of Fame is run  And all the Loss deplore  The Muses tear off their Laurel  â–ª  CALLIOPE  Well Sisters of the sacred Spring  Well may you rend your golden Hair  Well may you now your Dirges sing  And pierce with cries the troubled Air  CHORUS  Fate gave the Word c  CLIO  Founded in Justice was his Sway  Ambition never mark'd his Way  CALLIOPE  Unless the best Ambition that can fire  A Monarch's Breast and all his Soul inspire  The gen'rous Purpose of the noble Mind  The best Ambitionto serve Human Kind  APOLLO  Yes Virgins yes that Wish sublime  Rank'd him with those of earliest Time  Who for a People's Welfare strove  Whose Spirits breathe aetherial Air  And for their Meed of earthly Care  Drink Nectar with Olympian Jove  CALLIOPE  Oh TRUTH fair Daughter of the Sky  And MERCYthat with asking Eye  Near the OMNIPOTENT do'st stand  And when Mankind provoke his Rage  Do'st clasp his Knees his Wrath assuage  And win the Thunder from his Hand  CLIO  Oh whiterob'd FAITH caelestial Maid  Twinborn with JUSTICE by whose Aid  He liv'd the Guardian of the Laws  Dear LIBERTY round ALBION'S Isle  That bid'st eternal Sunshine smile  Who now will guard your sacred Cause  CHORUS  Dear Liberty c  CALLIOPE  Where were ye Muses when the fatal Sheers  The FURY rais'd to close his rev'rend Years  But ah vain wishyou could not stop the Blow  No Omen warn'd ye of th' impending Woe  APOLLO  See where BRITANNIA stands  With closeinfolded Hands  On yonder seabeat Shore  Behold her languid Air  Lo her dishevell'd Hair  Majestie now no more  Still on the sullen Wave her Eye is bent  The TRIDENT of the MAIN thrown idle by  OLD THAMES his seagreen Mantle rent  Inverts his Urn and heaves a doleful Sigh  Hark to the Winds and Waves  Frantic with Grief she raves  And Cruel Gods she cries  Each chalky Cliff around  Each Rock returns the Sound  And Cruel Gods replies  CALLIOPE  See the Procession sad and slow  Walks in a solemn Pomp of Woe  Thro' awful Arches gloomy Isles  And Rows of monumental Piles  Where lie the venerable Just  Where Heroes moulder into Dust  Now quietly inurn'd he lies  Pale pale inanimate and cold  Where round him baleful Vapours rise  'Midst Bones of Legislators old  CLIO  Of him who sought th' ambitious Gaul  Oe'r thickembattled Plains  Who felt who liv'd and reign'd for all  This only now remains  APOLLO  Bring in Handfuls Lillies bring  Bring me all the flow'ry Spring  Scatter Roses on his Bier  Ever honour'd ever dear  CHORUS  Scatter Roses c  MERCURY  descends  No more harmonious Progeny of Jove  No more let fun'ral Accents rise  The great the good AUGUSTUS reigns above  Translated to his kindred Skies  CLIO  No more for my Historic Page  CALLIOPE  No more for my great Epic Rage  BOTH  Will by the Hero now be done  CHORUS  His great Career of Fame is run  And all the Loss deplore  Enter  MARS  Lo Mars from his beloved Land  Where Freedom long hath fix'd her Stand  Bids ye collect your flowing Hair  And again the Laurel wear  For See BRITANNIA rears her drooping Head  Again resumes her TRIDENT of the Main  THAMES takes his Urn and seeks his wat'ry Bed  While gay Content sits smiling on the Plain  Hark a glad Voice  Proclaims the People's Choice  CHORUS  within the Scenes  He is our Liege our rightful Lord  Of Heart and Tongue with one Accord  We all will sing  Long live the King  He is our Liegehehe alone  With BRITISH HEART he mounts the Throne  Around him throngs a loyal Band  He will protect his NATIVE LAND  He is our Liege c  The Muses rise and put on their Laurels  CALLIOPE  The Muses now their Heads shall raise  The Arts to Life shall spring  Virgins we'll trim our wither'd Bayes  And wake each vocal String  Now shall the Sculptor's happy Skill  Touch the rude Stone to Life  The Painter shall his Canvass fill  Pleas  d with his mimic Strife  CLIO  Sweet MERCY FAITH CAELESTIAL TRUTH  Now by your Aid the Royal Youth  Shall live the Guardian of the Laws  Dear LIBERTY round ALBION'S Isle  That bid'st eternal Sunshine smile  He now will guard your sacred Cause  APOLLO  Blest Prince whose Subjects in each adverse Hour  For Freedom still have stood  Blest Isle whose Prince but deems the sov'reign Pow  The Pow'r of doing Good  MARS  Now open all your Helicon explore  Of Harmony the loftiest Store  Let the Drum beat Alarms  Such as rouze us to Arms  The Trumpet's shrill Clangor shall pierce thro' the Sky  Swell the Rapture swell it high  And in Notes sublime and clear  Pour the strong Melody that Heav'n may hear  APOLLO  Nothing mortal will I found  Lo the Flame the Flame divine  High I mount I quit the Ground  Holy Fury I am thine  With Rage possest  Big swells my Breast  In Visions rapt before my Sight appears  A brighter Order of encreasing Years  MARS  I see the Rhine devolve his Flood  Deepcrimson'd with the Gallic Blood  I hear I hear the distant Roar  Of Ruin on yon hostile Shore  I see YOUNG PRINCE to thee I see  The savage Indian bend the Knee  Lo AFRIC from her sable Kings  Her richest Stores in Tribute brings  And farthest IND beneath the rising Day  Lays down her Arms and venerates thy Sway  CALLIOPE  I see Bellona banish'd far  I see him close the Gates of War  While purple Rage within  With ghastly Ire shall grin  And rolling his Terrific Eyes  Where round him Heaps of Arms arise  Bound with a hundred brazen Chains  In vain shall foam and thirst for sanguine Plains  CLIO  Sweet Peace returns  O'er Albion's Sons  She waves her Dovelike Wing  On ev'ry Plain  The Shepherd Train  Their artless Loves shall sing  Pale DISCORD shall fly  From the Light of the Sky  To black Cocytus hurl'd  There there shall feel  Ixion's Wheel  The Furies with their Serpents curl'd  With the unceasing Toil shall groan  Of the unconquerable Stone  And leave in Harmony the British World  APOLLO  Proceed great Days lead on th' auspicious Years  Such Years for Lo the Scene of Fate appears  Such Years the DESTINIES have said shall roll  Jove nods Consent and Thunder shakes the Pole  FINIS  POSTSCRIPT  IT occurred to the Author of this little Piece that amidst  the general Condolence and Congratulations of the People  Theatre should not be silent He therefore put together  foregoing Lines and gave them to the Managers who  ave selected as much to be set to Musick as the Shortness of  ime would permit
