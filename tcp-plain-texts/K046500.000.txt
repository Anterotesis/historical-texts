HONOURABLE COUNTESS SPENCER Whose APPROBATION and ESTEEM were JUSTLY CONSIDERED by Mr GARRICK AS THE HIGHEST PANEGYRICK HIS TALENTS OR CONDUCT COULD ACQUIRE THIS IMPERFECT TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY IS WITH GREAT DEFERENCE INSCRIBED BY HER LADYSHIP's MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT  RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN  MARCH th  IF dying EXCELLENCE deserves a Tear  If fond Remembrance still is cherished here  Can we persist to bid your Sorrows flow  For fabled Suffe'rers and delusive Woe  Or with quaint Smiles dismiss the plaintive Strain  Point the quick Jestindulge the Comic Vein  Ere yet to buried ROSCIUS we assign  One kind Regretone tributary Line  His Fame requires we act a tenderer Part  His MEMORY claims the Tear you gave his ART  The general Voice the Meed of mournful Verse  The splendid Sorrows that adorned his Hearse  The Throng that mourn'd as their dead Favourite pass'd  The grac'd Respect that claim'd him to the last  While SHAKESPEAR'S Image from its hallow'd Base  Seem'd to prescribe the Grave and point the Place  Nor thesenor all the sad Regrets that flow  From fond Fidelity's domestic Woe  So much are GARRICK'S Praiseso much his DUE  As on this SpotOne Tear bestow'd by YOU  Amid the Arts which seek ingenuous Fame  OUR toil attempts the most precarious Claim  To HIM whose mimic Pencil wins the Prize  Obedient Fame immortal Wreaths supplies  Whate'er of Wonder REYNOLDS now may raise  RAPHAEL still boasts cotemporary Praise  Each dazling Light and gaudier Bloom subdu'd  With undiminish'd Awe HIS Works are view'd  E'en Beauty's Portrait wears a softer Prime  Touch'd by the tender Hand of mellowing Time  The patient SCULPTOR owns an humbler Part  A ruder Toil and more mechanic Art  Content with slow and timorous Stroke to trace  The lingering Line and mould the tardy Grace  But once atchievedtho' barbarous Wreck o'erthrow  The sacred Fane and lay its Glories low  Yet shall the sculptur'd Ruin rise to Day  Grac'd by Defect and worship'd in Decay  The' enduring Record bears the Artist's Name  Demands his Honors and asserts his Fame  Superior Hopes the POET'S Bosom fire  O proud Distinction of the sacred Lyre  Wide as the' inspiring PHOEBUS darts his Ray  Diffusive Splendor gilds his VOTARY'S Lay  Whether the Song Heroic Woes rehearse  With Epic Grandeur and the Pomp of Verse  Or fondly gay with unambitious Guile  Attempt no Prize but favouring Beauty's Smile  Or bear dejected to the lonely Grove  The soft Despair of unprevailing Love  Whate'er the Themethro' every Age and Clime  Congenial Passions meet the' according Rhyme  The Pride of GloryPity's Sigh sincere  Youth's earliest Blushand Beauty's Virgin Tear  Such is THEIR MeedTHEIR Honors thus secure  Whose Arts yield Objects and whose Works endure  The ACTOR only shrinks from Times Award  Feeble Tradition is HIS Memory's Guard  By whose faint Breath his Merits must abide  Unvouch'd by Proofto Substance unallied  Ev'n matchless GARRICK'S Art to Heav'n resign'd  No fix'd Effect no Model leaves behind  The GRACE of ACTIONthe adapted MIEN  Faithful as Nature to the varied Scene  Th' EXPRESSIVE GLANCEwhose subtle Comment draws  Entranc'd Attention and a mute Applause  GESTURE that marks with Force and Feeling fraught  A Sense in Silence and a Will in Thought  HARMONIOUS SPEECH whose pure and liquid Tone  Gives Verse a Music scarce confess'd its own  As Light from Gems assumes a brighter Ray  And cloathed with Orient Hues transcends the Day  PASSION'S wild Breakand FROWN that awes the Sense  And every CHARM of gentler ELOQUENCE  All perishablelike the' Electric Fire  But strike the Frameand as they strike expire  Incense too pure a bodied Flame to bear  It's Fragrance charms the Sense and blends with Air  WHERE thenwhile sunk in cold Decay he lies  And pale Eclipse for ever veils those Eyes  WHERE is the blest Memorial that ensures  Our GARRICK'S Famewhose is the Trust'tis YOURS  And O by every Charm his Art essay'd  To sooth your Caresby every Grief allay'd  By the hush'd Wonder which his Accents drew  By his last parting Tear repaid by you  By all those Thoughts which many a distant Night  Shall mark his Memory with a sad Delight  Still in your Heart's dear Record bear his Name  Cherish the keen Regret that lifts his Fame  To YOU it is bequeath'd assert the Trust  And to his WORTH'tis all you canbe JUST  What more is due from sanctifying Time  To chearful WIT and many a favour'd RHYME  O'er his grac'd Urn shall bloom a deathless Wreath  Whose blossom'd Sweets shall deck the Mask beneath  For thesewhen SCULPTURE'S votive Toil shall rear  The due Memorial of a Loss so dear  O lovliest Mourner Gentle MUSE be thine  The pleasing Woe to guard the laurell'd Shrine  As FANCY oft by Superstition led  To roam the Mansions of the sainted Dead  Has view'd by shadowy Eve's unfaithful Gloom  A weeping Cherub on a Martyr's Tomb  So thou sweet MUSE hang o'er HIS sculptur'd Bier  With patient Woe that loves the lingering Tear  With Thoughts that mournnor yet desire Relief  With meek Regret and fond enduring Grief  With Looks that speakHe never shall return  Chilling thy tender Bosom clasp his Urn  And with soft Sighs disperse the' irreverend Dust  Which TIME may strew upon his sacred Bust
