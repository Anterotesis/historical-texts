 THE DESERTED DAUGHTER A  COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENTGARDEN  DUBLIN  Printed by N Kelly  For P WOGAN P BYRNE J MOORE W JONES J RICE T M'DONNEL J JONES G FOLINGSBY and N KELLY    PROLOGUE  FRUITFUL in good and ill the teaming earth  To wheat and tares affords promiscuous birth  At once from nature's womb rise woe and weal  The springs that poison and the streams that heal  Nay more her offspring each and all contain  Within themselves both antidote and bane  Each is a jarring world where death yields life  And concord rises out of endless strife  Each seems distinct yet all together bound  And separate and collectively is found  A hoard of infinite a countless mass  Of miracles within a blade of grass  First of the tribe and master of the whole  Man stands erect the sovereign and the soul  In him all union and disunion shine  He's now above half brute now more than half divine  Wayward in humour infinite in wit  The slave of all to none will he submit  In act an idiot in conceit a sage  Mov'd by a breath he'll brave the tempest's rage  Now soar a demigod now sink a straw  Now weep a child now give the planets law  Railing at wretchedness in folly wise  Alive to all the bliss that he denies  Worthy your laughter or perhaps your tears  Brainsick of errors past to night appears  A moody mortal sketch'd on this mad plan  A surly misanthrope and yet a man  Within his orbit other beings move  Some urg'd by av'rice others spurr'd by love  To aid or injure him as passion drives  The worst of servants and the best of wives  With many more all waiting here within  My task being ended ready to begin  Hear and decide like men who think and feel  For from this night's decree there's no appeal  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Mr Mordent  Mr POPE  Cheveril  Mr LEWIS

pro∣portionOh this girl Why am I thus perturbed concerning her She can but be wretched and wretch∣edness is the certain sate of all  But then the world Why what an insatuated ass am I con∣temning  the

will not be warned it is not my fault  Exit  SCENE VII  The Dressing Room of  Lady ANNE  Lady ANNE  and  Mrs SARSNET  Mrs Sar  I told your Ladyship he would refuse  Lady A  What reason did he give  Mrs Sar  Reason forsooth Husbands never have any reason  Lady A  To herself  Unkind man Why does he thus wish to avoid me  Mrs Sar  He keeps his distance both day and night But I would teach him to sleep in two beds A pretty fashon truly I would tell him I was afraid of ghosts and so I married because I could not nor I would not lie alone So let him remember that  Lady A  Why were you so long in bringing the mes∣sage back  Mrs Sar  Why that is what I have to tell your Ladyship If there  is  not bad doings say I am no witch  Lady A  What do you mean  Mrs Sar  Your Ladyship must not be angry but you know I can't help having a sharp eye and a quick ear of my own  Lady A  What have you been doing now  Mrs Sar  So I saw my Master go into the steward's room  Lady A  Endeavouring to suppress her curiosity  Pshaw Folly What of that  Mrs Sar  So I had all my seven senses and my eyeteeth about me  Lady A  Pray have done  Mrs Sar  So I clapped my ear to the keyhole and then I heard awhuz buz  Lady A  This was very improper  Mrs Sar  So I could only catch up a word here and there and the first was  summut  aboutof a child  Lady A  A child  Mrs Sar  And a mother my Lady Though for the matter of that where there is a child one's own  nataral penetrality  will tell one there must be a mother  Lady A  Of what weakness am I guilty  Mrs Sar  And I thought I catched the sound of Mr Item of a fathering the child and I'm  posituve  he said it  wuz  against his conscience  Lady A  Who said so  Mrs Sar  Mr Item my Lady And so a little bit after my master called somebody a poor  injurious  girl and a  prodigality  of wit and beauty So then I heard somebody's foot on the stairs and I  wuz  fain to scamper  Lady A  I know not why I listen to this indecent prattle My overanxious curiosity betrays me and you are much too forward to profit by my weakness  Mrs Sar  Because you know my Lady I love you in my heart and it is all for your own good  Lady A  A child An injured girl Yet why do I feel agitation His infidelities have been too open for me to be ignorant of them And who has been to blame he or I Oh doubtful and difficult question  Mrs Sar  But I'll come at the truth I'll warrant me in all its  particlers  Lady A  Suffering perhaps under the consciousness of error which the sight of me might increase he flies from additional anguish Oh that I had the power to sooth and reconcile him to himself Why will he not receive consolation from me  Mrs Sar  I'll rummage about  Lady A  If I am unhappy how must I be certain that it is not my own fault Where there is unhappi∣ness neither party can be wholly blameless  Mrs Sar  He ought to love and adore such a Lady and clothe her in satin and gold  Lady A  Shall I tyrannize over the affections that I cannot win If I want the power to please let me correct my own defects and not accuse my husband of insensibility Oh nothing is so killing to a husband's love as a discontented irksome w  iling wife let me be any thing but that  Mrs Sar  He is a barbarian Turk and so I as good as told him  Lady A  What is the test of an affectionate wife It is that being wronged her love remains undi∣minished having cause of complaint she scorns to complain convinced that any misery is more wel∣come than the possibility of becoming the torment of her bosom's Lord Oh let me rather suffer every possible evil than endure my husband's hate  Mrs Sar  If any fellow was to use me so I know what I would do  Lady A  Yet have I not lost his love Dreadful doubt My family advise a separation and if this fatal loss be real how is it to be avoided Yet I will not sightly yield Let me hope my efforts will not all be ineffectual Would this agonizing contest were ended  Exit  Mrs Sar  She may say what she will but I know very well she is the most  miserableest  lady alive and I could tear his eyes out Husband indeed And so because I listened to the fellow's love and nonsense∣stuff and took pity on him when he was going to hang or drown himself he must think as soon as he has got me safe to be my lord and master I'd tell him another story My lord and master truly  Exit  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  The House of  Mrs

to smile at every look and word of mine Of what fatal errors have I been guilty that should have wrought this change  Mor  Oh exquisite Continue my nerves are strung  Lady A  To despair of recovering those inestimable blessings was quite sufficient But to be the cause of banishing a child from a father's arms and heart to cast it an orphan on a tempestuous world No what∣ever  my other mistakes may have been of that no tongue shall accuse me  Mor  Right let the guilt be all my own  Lady A  And now I have one last request to make which I conjure you by all our former affection not to deny  Mor  To ask favours where there is neither the power to grant nor the desire to be thanked is fruitless  Lady A  I am but too well acquainted with the state of your affairs  Mor  A humane motive for parting  Lady A  The settlements you have made on me in our early days of love were ample In the sincerity of affection I vowed if ever they should be necessary to your happiness that moment they should again be yours  Mor  Greatly agitated  Madam  Lady A  Pardon and endure this proof of my fide∣lity The deeds are now in Mr Clement's possession he will restore them to you  Mor  Indignantly

'Tis too much Scorpions could not sting like this  Lady A  On this last occasion suffer a gleam of for∣mer kindness once more to warm your bosom Money is a poor vehicle for the affections of the soul a con∣temptible token of the love I have borne you but such as it is for that love's sake give it welcome A cold adieu I cannot take It freezes my very heart From my soul I ever have loved and ever shall love Had I a heaven of happiness to bestow would you but deign to accept it from me it should be yours  Exit  Mor  Why so so soIt rages it bursts it is complete Let fate or fiends increase the

now thrice gentle friends our plotting ended  We hope you're pleas'dat least not much offended  Surely you'll own it was a little moving  To see a modern wife so very loving  Who deems the marriage vow a thing expedient  And is at once meek faithful and obedient  Such whims were common in the golden age  And still they may be met withon the stage  But grant they now are false past contradiction  We hope they yet may be endur'din fiction  Miss  WALLIS  You've heard that good Queen Befs had maids of honour  Whose courtly trade it was to wait upon her  To quaff brown stout yet not be overtaken  Breakfast on beef and sup on eggs and bacon  In those strange days I can't say what might happen  Virtue might then be thought the woman's weapon  But daughters now like me whate'er we feign  No where exist but in a poet's brain  Such blunders are too gross No soul can brook 'em  And yet I wish for once you'd overlook 'em  Mrs  MATTOCKS  Poor Man He's mad An heir of one and twenty  With frolicks freaks and pounds and passions plenty  Who being told where he may purchase beauty  Begins to cant of conscience love and duty  Was such stuff ever heard Ye sprigs of fashion  Say is it thus you treat the tender passion  'Ere such shall come and prophets shall speak truth  Yet put him not in poet's purgatory  For should you damn him we shall all be sorry  Miss  WALLIS  Then be sweet temper'd  Mrs  MATTOCKS  Grant the man his cause  Mrs  POPE  And once more make us blest in your applause
