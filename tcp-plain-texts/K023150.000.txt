 Mr  POPE  's ODE ON St  CECILIA  's Day  ODE FOR MUSICK  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  CrossKeys  in  Fleetstreet    ODE FOR MUSICK  I  DEscend ye Nine descend and sing  The breathing Instruments inspire  Wake into Voice each silent String  And sweep the sounding Lyre  In a sadlypleasing Strain  Let the warbling Lute complain  Let the loud Trumpet sound  Till the Roofs all around  The shrill Ecchos rebound  While in more lengthen'd Notes and slow  The deep majestick solemn Organs blow  Hark the Numbers soft and clear  Gently steal upon the Ear  Now louder and yet louder rise  And fill with spreading Sounds the Skies  Exulting in Triumph now swell the bold Notes  In broken Air trembling the wild Musick floats  Till by degrees remote and small  The Strains decay  And melt away  In a dying dying Fall  II  By Musick Minds an equal Temper know  Nor swell too high nor sink too low  If in the Breast tumultuous Joys arise  Musick her soft assuasive Voice applies  Or when the Soul is press'd with Cares  Exalts her in enlivening Airs  Warriors  she fires with animated Sounds  Pours Balm into the bleeding  Lover  's Wounds  At Musick  Melancholy  lifts her Head  Dull  Morpheus  rowzes from his Bed  Sloath  from its Lethargy awakes  And list'ning  Envy  drops her Snakes  Intestine War no more our  Passions  wage  Ev'n giddy  Factions  hear away their Rage  III  But when our Country's Cause provokes to Arms  How martial Musick every Bosom warms  So when the first bold Vessel dar'd the Seas  High on the Stern the  Thracian  rais'd his Strain  While  Argo  saw her kindred Trees  Descend from  Pelion  to the Main  Transported DemiGods stood round  And Men grew Heroes at the Sound  Enflam'd with Glory's Charms  Each Chief his sevenfold Shield display'd  And half unsheath'd the shining Blade  And Seas and Rocks and Skies rebound  To Arms to Arms to Arms  IV  But when thro' all th' Infernal Bounds  Which flaming  Phlegeton  surrounds  Sad  Orpheus  sought his Consort lost  Th' Inexorable Gates were barr'd  And nought was seen and nought was heard  Around the dreary Coast  But dreadful Gleams  Dismal Screams  Fires that glow  Shrieks of Woe  Sullen Moans  Hollow Groans  And Cries of tortur'd Ghosts  But hark he strikes the golden Lyre  And see the tortur'd Ghosts respire  See shady Forms advance  Thy Stone O  Sysiphus  stands still  Ixion  rests upon his Wheel  And the pale Spectres dance  The Furies sink upon their Iron Beds  And Snakes uncurl'd hang list'ning round their Heads  V  By the Streams that ever flow  By the fragrant Winds that blow  O'er th'  Elysian  Flowers  By those happy Souls who dwell  In Yellow Meads of  Asphodel    Or  Amaranthine  Bowers  By the Heroe's armed Shades  Glitt'ring thro' the gloomy Glades  By the Youths that dy'd for Love  Wandring in the Myrtle Grove  Restore restore  Eurydice  to Life  Oh take the Husband or return the Wife  He sung and Hell consented  To hear the Poet's Pray'r  Stern  Proserpine  relented  And gave him back the Fair  Thus Song could prevail  O'er Death and o'er Hell  A Conquest how hard and how glorious  Tho' Fate had fast bound her  With  Styx  nine times round her  Yet Musick and Love were Victorious  VI  But soon too soon the Lover turns his Eyes  Again she falls again she dies she dies  How wilt thou now the fatal Sisters move  No Crime was thine if 'tis no Crime to love  Now under hanging Mountains  Beside the Falls of Fountains  Or where  Hebrus  wanders  Rolling in  Maeanders    All alone  Unheard unknown  He makes his Moan  And calls her Ghost  For ever ever ever lost  Now with Furies surrounded  Despairing confounded  He trembles he glows  Amidst  Rhodope  's Snows  See wild as the Winds o'er the Desart he flies  Hark  Haemus  resounds with the  Bacchanals  Cries  Ah see he dies  Yet ev'n in Death  Eurydice  he sung  Eurydice  still trembled on his Tongue  Eurydice  the Woods  Eurydice  the Floods  Eurydice  the Rocks and hollow Mountains rung  VII  Musick the fiercest Griefs can charm  And Fate's severest Rage disarm  Musick can soften Pain to Ease  And make Despair and Madness please  Our Joys below it can improve  And antedate the Bliss above  This the Divine  Cecilia  found  And to her Maker's Praise confin'd the Sound  When the full Organ joins the tuneful Quire  The Immortal Pow'rs incline their Ear  Born on the swelling Notes our Souls aspire  While solemn Airs improve the sacred Fire  And Angels lean from Heav'n to hear  Of  Orpheus  now no more let Poets tell  To bright  Cecilia  greater Pow'r is giv'n  His Numbers rais'd a Shade from Hell  Hers lift the Soul to Heav'n  FINIS
