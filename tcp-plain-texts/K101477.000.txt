 LETTERS WRITTEN IN FRANCE IN THE SUMMER TO A FRIEND IN ENGLAND CONTAINING VARIOUS ANECDOTES RELATIVE TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND MEMOIRS OF MONS AND MADAME DU F    BY HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS  THE THIRD EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCXCII  LETTERS FROM FRANCE  LETTER I  I ARRIVED at Paris by a very rapid journey the day before the Federation and when I am disposed to murmur at the evils of my destiny I shall henceforth put this piece of good fortune into the opposite scale and reflect how many disappointments it ought to counterbalance Had the packet which conveyed me from Brighton to Dieppe sailed a few hours later had the wind been contrary in short had I not reached Paris at the moment I did reach it I should  have missed the most sublime spectacle which perhaps was ever represented on the theatre of this earth  I shall send you once a week the details which I promised when we parted though I am well aware how very imperfectly I shall be able to describe the images which press upon my mind It is much easier to feel what is sublime than to paint it and all I shall be able to give you will be a faint sketch to which your own imagination must add colouring and spirit The night before the Federation by way of prelude to the solemnities of that memorable day the Te Deum was performed at the church of Notre Dame by a greater number of musicians than have ever been assembled together excepting at Westminster Abbey The Overture which preceded the Te Deum was simple and majestic the music highly expressive had the power of electrifying the hearers and near the  conclusion of the piece the composer by artful discords produced a melancholy emotion and then by exciting ideas of trouble and inquietude prepared the mind for a recitative which affected the audience in a very powerful manner by recalling the images of that consternation and horror which prevailed in Paris on the th of July the day before that on which the Bastille was taken The words were as well as I can recollect what follows"People your enemies advance with hostile sentiments with menacing looks They come to bathe their hands in your blood Already they encompass the walls of your city Rise rise from the inaction in which you are plunged seize your arms and fly to the combat God will combat with you" These words were succeeded by a chorus of instruments and voices deep and solemn which seemed to chill the soul But what completed the effect was when the  sound of a loud and heavy bell mixed itself with this awful concert in imitation of the alarmbell which the day before the taking of the Bastille was rung in every church and convent in Paris and which it is said produced a confusion of sounds inexpressibly horrible At this moment the audience appeared to breathe with difficulty every heart seemed frozen with terror till at length the bell ceased the music changed its tone and another recitative announced the entire defeat of the enemy and the whole terminated after a flourish of drums and trumpets with an hymn of thanksgiving to the Supreme Being  LETTER II  I Promised to send you a description of the Federation but it is not to be described One must have been present to form any judgment of a scene the sublimity of which depended much less on its external magnificence than on the effect it produced on the minds of the spectators "The people sure the people were the sight" I may tell you of pavilions of triumphal arches of altars on which incense was burnt of two hundred thousand men walking in procession but how am I to give you an adequate idea of the behaviour of the spectators How am I to paint the impetuous feelings of that immense that exulting multitude Half a million of people assembled at a spectacle which furnished every image that  can elevate the mind of man which connected the enthusiasm of moral sentiment with the solemn pomp of religious ceremonies which addressed itself at once to the imagination the understanding and the heart  The Champ de Mars was formed into an immense amphitheatre round which were erected forty rows of seats raised one above another with earth on which wooden forms were placed Twenty days labour amimated by the enthusiasm of the people accomplished what seemed to require the toil of years Already in the Champ de Mars the distinctions of rank were forgotten and inspired by the same spirit the highest and lowest orders of citizens gloried in taking up the spade and assisting the persons employed in a work on which the common welfare of the State depended Ladies took the instruments of labour in their hands and removed a little of the earth that they  might be able to boast that they also had assisted in the preparations at the Champ de Mars and a number of old soldiers were seen voluntarily bestowing on their country the last remains of their strength A young Abbé of my acquaintance told me that the people beat a drum at the door of the convent where he lived and obliged the Superior to let all the Monks come out and work in the Champ de Mars The Superior with great reluctance acquiesced "Quant à moi" said the young Abbé "je ne demandois pas mieux  As for me I desired nothing better  "  At the upper end of the amphitheatre a pavilion was built for the reception of the King the Queen their attendants and the National Assembly covered with striped tentcloth of the national colours and decorated with streamers of the same beloved tints and fleurs de lys The  white flag was displayed above the spot where the King was seated In the middle of the Champ de Mars  l'Autel de la Patrie  was placed on which incense was burnt by priests dressed in long white robes with sashes of national ribbon Several inscriptions were written on the altar but the words visible at the greatest distance were "La Nation la Loi le Roi  The Nation the Law and the King  "  At the lower end of the amphitheatre opposite to the pavilion three triumphal arches were erected adorned with emblems and allegorical figures  The procession marched to the Champ de Mars through the central streets of Paris At La Place de Louis Quinze the escorts who carried the colours received under their banners ranged in two lines the National Assembly who came from the Tuilleries When the procession  passed the street where Henry the Fourth was assassinated every man paused as if by general consent the cries of joy were suspended and succeeded by a solemn silence This tribute of regret paid from the sudden impulse of feeling at such a moment was perhaps the most honourable testimony to the virtues of that amiable Prince which his memory has yet received  In the streets at the windows and on the roofs of the houses the people transported with joy shouted and wept as the procession passed Old men were seen kneeling in the streets blessing God that they had lived to witness that happy moment The people ran to the doors of their houses loaded with refreshments which they offered to the troops and crowds of women surrounded the soldiers and holding up their infants in their arms and melting into tears promised to make their children imbibe from their earliest  age an inviolable attachment to the principles of the new constitution  The procession entered the Champ de Mars by a long road which thousands of people had assisted in forming by filling up deep hollows levelling the rising grounds and erecting a temporary bridge across the Seine opposite to the triumphal arches The order of the procession was as follows  A troop of horse with trumpets  A great band of music  A detachment of grenadiers  The electors chosen at Paris in  A band of volunteers  The assembly of the representatives of the people  The military committee  Company of chasseurs  A band of drums  The Presidents of sixty districts  The Deputies of the people sent to the Federation  The Administrators of the Municipality  Bands of music and drums  Battalion of children carrying a standard on which was written  L'Espérance de la Patrie  The Hope of the Country    Detachment with the colours of the national guard of Paris  Battalion of veterans  Deputies from fortytwo departments arranged alphabetically  The Oriflamme or grand standard of the Kings of France  Deputies from the regular troops  Deputies from the navy  Deputies from fortyone departments arranged also alphabetically  Band of volunteer chasseurs  Troop of horse with trumpets  The procession which was formed with eight persons abreast entered the Champ de Mars beneath the triumphal arches  with a discharge of cannon The deputies placed themselves round the inside of the amphitheatre Between them and the seats of the spectators the national guard of Paris were ranged and the seats round the amphitheatre were filled with four hundred thousand people The middle of the amphitheatre was crowded with an immense multitude of soldiers The National Assembly walked towards the pavilion where they placed themselves with the King the Queen the Royal Family and their attendants and opposite this group rose in perspective the hills of Passy and Chaillot covered with people The standards of which one was presented to each department of the kingdom as a mark of brotherhood by the citizens of Paris were carried to the altar to be consecrated by the bishop High mass was performed after which Monsieur de la Fayette who had been appointed by the King MajorGeneral of  the Federation ascended the altar gave the signal and himself took the national oath In an instant every sword was drawn and every arm lifted up The King pronounced the oath which the President of the National Assembly repeated and the solemn words were reechoed by six hundred thousand voices while the Queen raised the Dauphin in her arms shewing him to the people and the army At the moment the consecrated banners were displayed the sun which had been obscured by frequent showers in the course of the morning burst forth while the people lifted their eyes to heaven and called upon the Deity to look down and witness the sacred engagement into which they entered A respectful silence was succeeded by the cries the shouts the acclamations of the multitude they wept they embraced each other and then dispersed  You will not suspect that I was an indifferent  witness of such a scene Oh no this was not a time in which the distinctions of country were remembered It was the triumph of human kind it was man asserting the noblest privilege of his nature and it required but the common feelings of humanity to become in that moment a citizen of the world For myself I acknowledge that my heart caught with enthusiasm the general sympathy my eyes were filled with tears and I shall never forget the sensations of that day  while memory holds her seat in my bosom  The weather proved very unfavourable during the morning of the Federation but the minds of people were too much elevated by ideas of moral good to attend to the physical evils of the day Several heavy showers were far from interrupting the general gaiety The people when drenched by the rain called out with exultation rather than regret  We are wet for the nation  Nous  sommes mouillés à la nation  Some exclaimed  The French revolution is cemented with water instead of blood  La révolution Françoise est cimenté avec de l'eau au lieu de sang  The national guard during the hours which preceded the arrival of the procession amused the spectators  With dancing in a circle  d'une dance ronde  and with a thousand whimsical and playful evolutions highly expressive of that gaiety which distinguishes the French character I believe none but Frenchmen would have diverted themselves and half a million of people who were waiting in expectation of a scene the most solemn upon record by circles of ten thousand men galloping  In the round dance  en dance ronde  But if you are disposed to think of this gaiety with the contempt of superior gravity for I will not call it wisdom recollect that these dancers were the very men whose bravery formed the great epocha of French liberty the heroes who  demolished the towers of the Bastille and whose fame will descend to the latest posterity  Such was the admirable order with which this august spectacle was conducted that no accident interrupted the universal festivity All carriages were forbidden during that day and the entrances to the Champ de Mars were so numerous that half a million of people were collected together without a crowd  The people had only one subject of regret they murmured that the King had taken the national oath in the pavilion instead of performing that ceremony at the foot of the altar and some of them crowding round Mons de la Fayette conjured him to persuade the King to go to the altar and take the oath a second time  My friends the oath is not an air which can be played twice over  Mes enfans  said Mons de la Fayette  le serment n'est pas une ariette on ne peut pas le jouer deux fois  Mons de la Fayette after the Federation went to the Château de la Muette where a public dinner was prepared for the national guard An immense crowd gathered round him when he alighted from his horse at a little distance from the château and some Aristocrates mixing themselves with the true worshippers of him who is so justly the idol of the French nation attempted to stifle him with their embraces He called out "  But my friends you stifle me  Mais mes amis vous m'étouffez  " and one of his  aides de camp  who perceived the danger of his general threw himself from his horse which he entreated Mons de la Fayette to mount He did so and hastened to the château  This incident reminds me of a line in Racine's fine tragedy of Britannicus where Nero says  I embrace my rival but it is to destroy him  J'embrasse mon rival mais c'est pour l'étouffer  Adieu  LETTER III  THE rejoicings at Paris did not terminate with the ceremony of the Federation A succession of entertainments which lasted several days were prepared for the deputies from the provinces who were all quartered in the houses of the bourgeois where they were received with the most cordial hospitality  The night of the th of July the whole city of Paris was illuminated and the next day  le cidevant Duc  now Mons d'Orleans gave a public dinner to the national guard in the hall of the Palais Royal We walked in the evening round the gallery from which we saw part of the crowd below amusing themselves by dancing while others were singing in chorus the favourite national songs  On the following Sunday the national guards were reviewed by Mons de la Fayette in the Champ de Mars which was again filled with spectators and the people appeared more enthusiastic than ever in their applauses of their general The Champ de Mars resounded with repeated cries of  Long live Mons de la Fayette  Vive Mons de la Fayette  On this day carriages were again forbidden and the evening displayed a scene of general rejoicing The whole city was illuminated and crowds of company filled the gardens of the Tuilleries from which we saw the beautiful  façade  of the Louvre lighted in the most splendid manner In the Champs Elysées where a fête was given to the Deputies innumerable lamps were hung from one row of trees to another and shed the most agreeable brilliance on those enchanting walks where the exhilarated crowd danced  and sung and filled the air with the sound of rejoicing Several parties of the national guard came from the Champs Elysées dancing along the walks of the Tuilleries with a woman between every two men and all the priests whom they met in their way they obliged to join in the dance treating them as women by placing them between two soldiers and sometimes sportively dressing them in grenadiers caps Fireworks of great variety and beauty were exhibited on the Pont Neuf and the statue of Henry the Fourth was decorated with the ornament of all others the most dear in the eyes of the people a scarf of national ribbon Transparencies of Mons de la Fayette and Mons Bailly were placed as the highest mark of public favour on each side of this revered statue  But the spectacle of all others the most interesting to my feelings was the rejoicings at the Bastille The ruins of that  execrable fortress were suddenly transformed as if with the wand of necromancy into a scene of beauty and of pleasure The ground was covered with fresh clods of grass upon which young trees were placed in rows and illuminated with a blaze of light Here the minds of the people took a higher tone of exultation than in the other scenes of festivity Their mutual congratulations their reflections on the horror of the past their sense of present felicity their cries of  Long live the Nation  Vive la Nation  still ring in my ear I too though but a sojourner in their land rejoiced in their happiness joined the universal voice and repeated with all my heart and soul "Vive la nation"  LETTER IV  BEFORE I suffered my friends at Paris to conduct me through the usual routine of convents churches and palaces I requested to visit the Bastille feeling a much stronger desire to contemplate the ruins of that building than the most perfect edifices of Paris When we got into the carriage our French servant called to the coachman with an air of triumph  To the Bastillebut we shall not remain there  A la Bastillemais nous n'y resterons pas  We drove under that porch which so many wretches have entered never to repass and alighting from the carriage descended with difficulty into the dungeons which were too low to admit of our standing upright and so dark that we were obliged at noonday to visit them with the light of a candle We saw the  hooks of those chains by which the prisoners were fastened round the neck to the walls of their cells many of which being below the level of the water are in a constant state of humidity and a noxious vapour issued from them which more than once extinguished the candle and was so insufferable that it required a strong spirit of curiosity to tempt one to enter Good Godand to these regions of horror were human creatures dragged at the caprice of despotic power What a melancholy consideration that  Man proud man  Drest in a little brief authority  Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven  As make the angels weep  There appears to be a greater number of these dungeons than one could have imagined the hard heart of tyranny itself would contrive for since the destruction of the building many subterraneous cells have been discovered underneath a piece  of ground which was inclosed within the walls of the Bastille but which seemed a bank of solid earth before the horrid secrets of this prisonhouse were disclosed Some skeletons were found in these recesses with irons still fastened on their decaying bones  After having visited the Bastille we may indeed by surprised that a nation so enlightened as the French submitted so long to the oppressions of their government but we must cease to wonder that their indignant spirits at length shook off the galling yoke  Those who have contemplated the dungeons of the Bastille without rejoicing in the French revolution may for aught I know be very respectable persons and very agreeable companions in the hours of prosperity but if my heart were sinking with anguish I should not fly to those persons for consolation Sterne says that a man is incapable of loving one woman  as he ought who has not a sort of an affection for the whole sex and as little should I look for particular sympathy from those who have no feelings of general philanthropy If the splendor of a despotic throne can only shine like the radiance of lightning while all around is involved in gloom and horror in the name of heaven let its baleful lustre be extinguished for ever May no such strong contrast of light and shade again exist in the political system of France but may the beams of liberty like the beams of day shed their benign influence on the cottage of the peasant as well as on the palace of the monarch May Liberty which for so many ages past has taken pleasure in softening the evils of the bleak and rugged climates of the North in fertilizing a barren soil in clearing the swamp in lifting mounds against the inundations of the tempest diffuse her blessings also on the genial land of France  and bid the husbandman rejoice under the shade of the olive and the vine  The Bastille which Henry the Fourth and his veteran troops assailed in vain the citizens of Paris had the glory of taking in a few hours The avarice of Mons de Launay had tempted him to guard this fortress with only half the complement of men ordered by Government and a letter which he received the morning of the th of July commanding him to sustain the siege till the evening when succour would arrive joined to his own treachery towards the assailants cost him his life  The courage of the besiegers was inflamed by the horrors of famine there being at this time only twentyfour hours provision of bread in Paris For some days the people had assembled in crowds round the shops of the bakers who were obliged to have a guard of soldiers to protect them from the famished multitude  while the women rendered furious by want cried in the resolute tone of despair  We must have bread for our children  Il nous faut du pain pour nos enfans  Such was the scarcity of bread that a French gentleman told me that the day preceding the taking of the Bastille he was invited to dine with a  Négociant  and when he went was informed that a servant had been out five hours in search of bread and had at last been able to purchase only one loaf  It was at this crisis it was to save themselves the shocking spectacle of their wives and infants perishing before their eyes that the citizens of Paris flew to arms and impelled by such causes fought with the daring intrepidity of men who had all that renders life of any value at stake and who determined to die or conquer The women too far from indulging the fears incident to our feeble  sex in defiance of the cannon of the Bastille ventured to bring victuals to their sons and husbands and with a spirit worthy of Roman matrons encouraged them to go on Women mounted guard in the streets and when any person passed called out boldly  Who goes there  "Qui va là"  A gentleman who had the command of fifty men in this enterprise told me that one of his soldiers being killed by a cannonball the people with great marks of indignation removed the corpse and then snatching up the dead man's hat begged money of the bystanders for his interment in a manner characteristic enough of that gaiety which never forsakes the French even on such occasions as would make any other people on earth serious  Madam for this poor devil who has been killed for the NationSir for this unfortunate dog who has been killed for the Nation  Madame pour ce pauvre diable qui s'est fait tuer pour la Nation  Monsieur pour ce pauvre chien qui s'est fait tuer pour la Nation  This mode of supplication though not very pathetic obtained the end desired no person being sufficiently obdurate to resist the powerful plea  Had been killed for the Nation  "qu'il s'est fait tuer pour la Nation"  When the Bastille was taken and the old man of whom you have no doubt heard and who had been confined in a dungeon thirtyfive years was brought into daylight which had not for so long a space of time visited his eyes he staggered shook his white beard and cried faintly  Gentlemen you have rendered me one great service render me anotherkill me for I know not where to goCome along come along the Nation will provide for you  "Messieurs vous m'avez rendu un grand service rendezm'en un autre tuezmoi je ne sais pas où aller""Allons allons" the crowd answered with one voice "la Nation te nourrira"  As the heroes of the Bastille passed along the streets after its surrender the citizens stood at the doors of their houses loaded with wine brandy and other refreshments which they offered to these deliverers of their country but they unanimously refused to taste any strong liquors considering the great work they had undertaken as not yet accomplished and being determined to watch the whole night in case of any surprise  All those who had assisted in taking the Bastille were presented by the Municipality of Paris with a ribbon of the national colours on which is stamped inclosed in a circle of brass an impression of the Bastille and which is worn as a military order  The Municipality of Paris also proposed a solemn funeral procession in memory of those who lost their lives in this enterprise but on making application to the National Assembly for a deputation  of its members to assist at this solemnity the Assembly were of opinion that these funeral honours should be postponed till a more favourable moment as they might at present have a tendency to inflame the minds of the people  I have heard several persons mention a young man of a little insignificant figure who the day before the Bastille was taken got up on a chair in the Palais Royal and harangued the multitude conjuring them to make a struggle for their liberty and asserting that now the moment was arrived They listened to his eloquence with the most eager attention and when he had instructed as many as could hear him at one time he requested them to depart and repeated his harangue to a new set of auditors  Among the dungeons of the Bastille are placed upon a heap of stones the figures of the two men who contrived the plan of this fortress where they were  afterwards confined for life These men are represented chained to the wall and are beheld without any emotion of sympathy  The person employed to remove the ruins of the Bastille has framed of the stones eightythree complete models of this building which with a true patriotic spirit he has presented to the eightythree departments of the kingdom by way of hint to his countrymen to take care of their liberties in future  LETTER V  I AM just returned from a visit to Madame Sillery whose works on education are so well known and so justly esteemed in England and who received me with the most engaging politeness Surely the French are unrivalled in the arts of pleasing in the power of uniting with the most polished elegance of manners that attentive kindness which seems to flow warm from the heart and which while it soothes our vanity secures our affections Madame Sillery and her pupils are at present at St Leu a beautiful spot in the rich valley of Montmorenci Mons d'Orleans has certainly conferred a most essential obligation upon his children by placing them under the care of this lady I never met  with young people more amiable in their dispositions or more charming in their manners which are equally remote from arrogance and from those efforts of condescension which I have seen some great people make with much difficulty to themselves and much offence to others The Princess who is thirteen years of age has a countenance of the sweetest expression and appears to me to be Adelaide the heroine of Madame Sillery's Letters on Education personified The three Princes though under Madame Sillery's superintendence have also preceptors who live in the house and assist in their education The eldest Prince Mons de Chartres is nearly eighteen years of age and his attentive politeness formed a striking contrast in my mind to the manners of those fashionable gentlemen in a certain great metropolis who consider apathy and negligence as the test of goodbreeding But if I was pleased with the  manners of this young Prince I was still more delighted to find him a confirmed friend to the new constitution of France and willing with the enthusiasm of a young and ardent mind to renounce the splendor of his titles for the general good When he heard that the sacrifice of fortune also was required and that the immense property which he had been taught to consider as his inheritance was to be divided with his brothers he embraced them with the utmost affection declaring that he should rejoice in such a division To find a democratic Prince was somewhat singular I was much less surprised that Madame Sillery had adopted sentiments which are so congenial to an enlarged and comprehensive mind This lady I have called Sillery because it is the name by which she is known in England but since the decree of the National Assembly abolishing the nobility  she has renounced with her title the name of Sillery and has taken that of Brulart  She talked to me of the distinctions of rank in the spirit of philosophy and ridiculed the absurdity of converting the rewards of personal merit into the inheritance of those who had perhaps so little claim to honours that they were a sort of oblique reproach on their character and conduct There may be arguments against hereditary rank sufficiently convincing to such an understanding as Madame Brulart's but I know some French ladies who entertain very different notions on this subject who see no impropriety in the establishments of nobility and who have carried their love of aristocratical rights so far as to keep their beds in a fit of despondency upon being obliged to relinquish the agreeable epithets of Comtesse or Marquise to which their ears had been so long accustomed  But let me do justice to the ladies of France The number of those who have murmured at the loss of rank bears a very small proportion to those who have acted with a spirit of distinguished patriotism who with those generous affections which belong to the female heart have gloried in sacrificing titles fortune and even the personal ornaments so dear to female vanity for the common cause It was the ladies who gave the example of  le don patriotique  The patriotic donation  by offering their jewels at the shrine of Liberty and if the women of ancient Rome have gained the applause of distant ages for such actions the women of France will also claim the admiration of posterity  The women have certainly had a considerable share in the French revolution for whatever the imperious lords of the creation may fancy the most important  events which take place in this world depend a little on our influence and we often act in human affairs like those secret springs in mechanism by which though invisible great movements are regulated  But let us return to Madame Brulart who wears at her breast a medallion made of a stone of the Bastille polished In the middle of the medallion  Liberté  was written in diamonds above was marked in diamonds the planet that shone on the th of July and below was seen the moon of the size she appeared that memorable night The medallion was set in a branch of laurel composed of emeralds and tied at the top with the national cockade formed of brilliant stones of the three national colours  Our conversation on the subject of the Bastille led Madame Brulart to relate an action of Mons de Chartres which reflects the highest honour on his humanity Being in Normandy he visited Mont St  Michel a fortress built on a rock which stands a league and a half from the coast of Normandy The tide covers this space twice every twentyfour hours but when it is low water a person can pass over on foot Mont St Michel was originally a church founded by a good bishop in the seventh century in honour of St Michel who it seems appeared to him in a vision on this spot Richard the first Duke of Normandy of that name afterwards converted the church into an abbey and this abbey gave rise to the military order  des Chevaliers de St Michel  instituted by Louis the Eleventh After having seen the precious relics of the abbey the square buckler and the short sword found in Ireland near the body of the wellknown dragon whose destruction is attributed to the prowess of St Michel Mons de Chartres was conducted through many labyrinths to the subterraneous parts of the edifice where he was shewn a wooden  cage which was made by order of Louis the Fourteenth for the punishment of an unfortunate wit who had dared to ridicule his conquests in Holland no sooner gained than lost Mons de Chartres beheld with horror this instrument of tyranny in which prisoners were still frequently confined and expressing in very strong terms his indignation he was told that as a prince of the blood he had a right if he thought proper to order the cage to be destroyed Scarcely were the words pronounced when the young Prince seized a hatchet gave the first stroke himself to this execrable machine waited to see it levelled with the ground and thus may claim the glory of having even before the demolition of the Bastille begun the French revolution  We found at St Leu a young English lady who is the companion of the Princess and whose appearance is calculated to give the most favourable idea of English  beauty I never saw more regular features or an expression of countenance more lovely and Madame Brulart by whom she has been educated assured me that  the mind keeps the promise we had from the face  This young lady talked of her own country with a glow of satisfaction very grateful to my feelings She seems to  Cast a look where England's glories shine  And bids her bosom sympathise with mine  LETTER VI  I HAVE been at the National Assembly where at a time when the deputies from the provinces engrossed every ticket of admission my sister and I were admitted without tickets by the gentleman who had the commad of the guard and placed in the best seats before he suffered the doors to be opened to other people We had no personal acquaintance with this gentleman or any claim to his politeness except that of being foreigners and women but these are of all claims the most powerful to the urbanity of French manners  My sister observed to me that our seats which were immediately opposite the tribune from which the members speak reminded her of our struggles to attain the  same situation in Westminster Hall But you must recollect I answered that we have attained this situation without any struggle I believe however that if the fame of Mr Fox's eloquence should lead a French woman to present herself at the door of Westminster Hall without a ticket she might stand there as long as Mr Hastings's trial has lasted without being permitted to pass the barrier  The hall of the National Assembly is long and narrow at each end there is a gallery where the common people are admitted by applying very early in the morning for numbers which are distributed at the door and the persons who first apply secure the first numbers The seats being also numbered all confusion and disorder are prevented The galleries at the side of the hall are divided into boxes which are called tribunes they belong to the principal members of the National Assembly and to  these places company are admitted with tickets Rows of seats are placed round the hall raised one above another where the Members of the Assembly are seated and immediately opposite the chair of the President in the narrow part of the hall is the tribune which the Members ascend when they are going to speak One capital subject of debate in this Assembly is who shall speak first for all seem more inclined to talk than to listen and sometimes the President in vain rings a bell or with the vehemence of French action stretches out his arms and endeavours to impose silence while the six Huissiers persons who are appointed to keep order make the attempt with as little success as the President himself But one ceases to wonder that the meetings of the National Assembly are tumultuous on reflecting how important are the objects of its deliberations Not only the lives and fortunes of individuals but the  existence of the country is at stake and of how little consequence is this impetuosity in debate if the decrees which are passed are wise and beneficial and the new constitution arises like the beauty and order of nature from the confusion of mingled elements I heard several of the Members speak but I am so little qualified to judge of oratory that without presuming to determine whether I had reason to be entertained or not I shall only tell you that I was so  And this repeated I with exultation to myself this is the National Assembly of France Those men now before my eyes are the men who engross the attention the astonishment of Europe for the issue of whose decrees surrounding nations wait in suspense and whose fame has already extended through every civilized region of the globe the men whose magnanimity invested them with power to destroy the old constitution and whose wisdom is  erecting the new on a principle of perfection which has hitherto been thought chimerical and has only served to adorn the page of the philosopher but which they believe may be reduced to practice and have therefore the courage to attempt My mind with a sensation of elevated pleasure passing through the interval of ages anticipated the increasing renown of these legislators and the period when all the nations of Europe following the liberal system which France has adopted the little crooked policy of the present times shall give place to the reign of reason virtue and science  The most celebrated characters in the National Assembly were pointed out to us Monsieur Barnave de Dauphine who is only six and twenty years of age and the youngest member of the Assembly is esteemed its first orator and is the leader of the democratic party I believe Mons Barnave does not owe all his reputation  to his talents however distinguished his virtues also claim a considerable share of that applause which he receives from his country He has shewn himself as steadfast in principle as he is eloquent in debate With firm undeviating integrity he has defended the cause of the people Every motion he has made in the Assembly has passed into a law because its beneficial tendency has been always evident and it was he who effected that memorable decree which deprived the King of the right of making war without the consent of the nation Mons Barnave is adored by the people who have two or three times taken the horses from his carriage and drawn him in triumph along the streets of Paris  We also saw Mons Mirabeau l'aîné whose genius is of the first class but who possesses a very small share of popularity I am however one of his partisans  though not merely from that enthusiasm which always comes across my heart in favour of great intellectual abilities Mons Mirabeau has another very powerful claim on my partiality he is the professed friend and I must and will love him for being so of the African race He has proposed the abolition of the slavetrade to the National Assembly and though the Assembly have delayed the consideration of this subject on account of those deliberations which immediately affect the country yet perhaps if our senators continue to doze over this affair as they have hitherto done the French will have the glory of setting us an example which it will then be our humble employment to follow But I trust the period will never come when England will submit to be taught by another nation the lesson of humanity I trust an English House of Commons will never persist in thinking that what is morally  wrong can be politically right that the virtue and the prosperity of a people are things at variance with each other and that a country which abounds with so many sources of wealth cannot afford to close one polluted channel which is stained with the blood of our fellowcreatures  But it is a sort of treason to the honour the spirit the generosity of Englishmen to suppose they will persevere in such conduct Admitting however a supposition which it is painful to make admitting that they should abide by this system of inhumanity they will only retard but will not finally prevent the abolition of slavery The Africans have not long to suffer nor their oppressors to triumph Europe is hastening towards a period too enlightened for the perpetuation of such monstrous abuses The mists of ignorance and error are rolling fast away and the benign beams of philosophy are spreading their lustre over the nationsBut  whither have these children of captivity led me I perceive I have wandered a great way from the National Assembly where I was so happily seated and of which I will tell you more in my next letter  LETTER VII  THE Abbé Maury is one of the most distinguished members of the National Assembly He possesses astonishing powers of eloquence but he has done his talents the injustice to make them subservient to the narrow considerations of selfinterest Had he displayed that ability in defence of civil and religious liberty which he has employed in the service of the exorbitant pretensions of the church he would have deserved the highest applause of his country instead of which he has called to the aid of his genius an auxiliary it ought to have scorned that subtlety which tries "to make the worse appear the better reason" and he is still more detested than admired I am not surprised that a little mind is sometimes  tempted by interest to tread in a mean and sordid path but I own it does astonish me that genius can be seduced from the fair field of honourable fame into those serpentine ways where it can meet with no object worthy of its ambition "Something too much of this" You shall hear a repartee of the Abbé Maury who after having made a very unpopular motion in the Assembly was insulted as he was going out the people crying as they are too apt to do  To the lantern  "A la lanterne" The Abbé turning to the crowd answered with equal indignation and spirit  If I were at the lantern would you be more enlightened  Eh Messieurs si j'étois à la lanterne seriezvous plus éclairés  The Abbé Maury before the revolution was in possession of eight hundred farms and has lost sixty thousand livres a year in consequence of that event But enough  of Mons l'Abbé whose picture I have just purchased in a snuffbox You touch a spring open the lid of the snuffbox and the Abbé jumps up and occasions much surprise and merriment The joke however is grown a little stale in France but I shall bring the Abbé with me to England where I flatter myself his sudden appearance will afford some diversion  A singular but very respectable figure in the National Assembly is a Deputy from Britany called Le Père Gerard This venerable old man is a peasant and his appearance reminds one of those times when Generals were called from the plough to take the command of armies The dress of Le Père Gerard is made of a coarse woollen cloth which is worn by the peasants of Britany and is of such strong texture that a coat often descends from one generation to another This cloth is called Pinchina and the King to whom the old Breton has presented several  addresses from the Assembly calls him  In pleasantry Father Pinchina  en badinage  Le Père Pinchina When I saw him he had on this everlasting coat and wore worsted stockings gartered above the knees But what pleased me most in his appearance were the long white hairs which hung down his shoulders an ornament for which you know I have a particular predilection  The respectable Père Gerard boasts that he is descended from a race of deputies his great grandfather having been chosen as a deputy to  les EtatsGénéraux  in the last time the States were held before that memorable period when they effected the revolution  At the time when the ladies set the example of  The patriotic donation  le don patriotique  by offering their jewels and the members of the National Assembly in a moment of enthusiasm  took the silver buckles out of their shoes and laid them on the President's table the Père Gerard rose and said that he had no such offering to give his buckles being made of brass but that his  don patriotique  should be that of rendering his services to his country unpaid The old man was heard by the Assembly with the applause he merited and the people on the day of the Federation carried him from the Champ de Mars to his own house in triumph on their shoulders  Messieurs Charles and Alexander Lameth two brothers and Mons Rabeau de St Estienne are among the first patriots of the National Assembly and have a very high reputation for talents The French who love what they call an  A play upon words  équivoque  tell you  que Mons Rabeau vaut deux d'Mirabeau  The meetings of the Assembly though still tumultuous are much less so than  they were at their first commencement A gentleman who was present when the motion was made for abolishing monasteries told me that the minds of the Members were on that occasion inflamed to such a height that it appeared to him very probable that the debate would end in a massacre He mentioned a circumstance very characteristic of French vivacity One of the Members was expressing himself in these words "What is a Monk" A man who has renounced his father his mother every tie every affection that is dear in nature and for whom"before the speaker could finish his sentence a Member from the other end of the hall seized the moment while the orator was drawing his breath and called out  For a foreign power  Pour une puissance étrangère  to the great horror of  le côté noir  for so the clergy are called  The Democrates place themselves on one side of the hall and the Aristocrates on the other The spectators in the galleries take such a part in the debate as frequently to express their applause by clapping their hands with great violence An old Maréchal of France rose the day I was at the Assembly when they were debating on the military pensions and declared that in recompense for the services which he had rendered his country he desired honours and not pay The Assembly clapped him and the galleries joined in this mark of approbation A young Frenchman who sat next me whispered to me  I suppose that gentleman finds money troublesome  Mons trouve apparemment que l'argent l'incommode  The Members of the National Assembly are paid three crowns a day for their attendance while in England a candidate for a seat in parliament often spends  many thousand pounds and with magnificent generosity makes a whole county drunk for a week merely to enjoy the privilege of serving his country without pay  The qualification requisite for a member of the National Assembly is that of possessing sufficient property in land or houses to pay taxes to the amount of a  marc d'argent  which is the value of four  louis  Every hundred of the citizens who pay taxes to Government of three days labour or three  livres  have a right to vote for an elector whose qualification is that of paying taxes to the amount of ten  livres  or ten days labour The electors of one department meet together in one assembly and choose from among their own body the persons who are to direct the administration of that department Those electors will also choose in the same manner the deputies sent by that department to the National Assembly There  will therefore be only one intermediate degree between the lowest order of active citizens and the members of the National Assembly  I was interrupted by a visitor who related a little incident which has interested me so much that I can write of nothing else at present and you shall therefore have it warm from my heart While the National Assembly were deliberating upon the division of property among brothers a young man of high birth and fortune who is a member of the Assembly entered with precipitation and mounting the tribune with great emotion informed the Assembly that he had just received accounts that his father was dying that he himself was his eldest son and had come to conjure the Assembly to pass without delay that equitable decree giving the younger sons an equal share of fortune with the eldest in order he said that his father might have the satisfaction before  he breathed his last of knowing that all his children were secure of a provision If you are not affected by this circumstance you have read it with very different feelings from those with which I have written it but if on the contrary you have fallen in love with this young Frenchman do not imagine your passion is singular for I am violently in love with him myself  LETTER VIII  YOU have not heard perhaps that on the day of the Federation at Paris the national oath was taken throughout the whole kingdom at the hour of twelve  A great number of farmers and peasants walked in the procession at Rouen bearing in their hands the instruments of their husbandry decorated with national ribbons The national guard cut down branches from the trees and stuck them in their hats and a French gentleman of my acquaintance who understands English and reads Shakespeare told me that it seemed like Birnham Wood coming to Dunsinane  The leaders of the French revolution are men well acquainted with the human heart They have not trusted merely to  the force of reason but have studied to interest in their cause the most powerful passions of human nature by the appointment of solemnities perfectly calculated to awaken that general sympathy which is caught from heart to heart with irresistible energy fills every eye with tears and throbs in every bosom  I have heard of a procession which took place not long ago in one of the districts of Paris in which five hundred young ladies walked dressed in white and decorated with cockades of the national ribbon leading by silken cords a number of prisoners newly released from captivity and who with their faces covered by long flowing veils were conducted to a church where they returned thanks for their deliverance  Thus have the leaders of the revolution engaged beauty as one of their auxiliaries justly concluding that to the gallantry and sensibility of Frenchmen no argument  would be found more efficacious than that of a pretty face  I have just read a private letter from a little town about two leagues from Montauban called NegrePelisse where the inhabitants on the day of the Federation displayed a liberality of sentiment which reflects honour not only on themselves but on the age in which we live The national guard of this little town and its environs were assembled to take the national oath Half of the inhabitants being Protestants and the other half Catholics the Curé and the Protestant Minister ascended together one altar which had been erected by the citizens and administered the oath to their respective parishioners at the same moment after which Catholics and Protestants joined in singing Te Deum  Surely religious worship was never performed more truly in the spirit of the Divine Author of Christianity whose great  precept is that of universal love Surely the incense of praise was never more likely to ascend to Heaven than when the Catholics and Protestants of NegrePelisse offered it together  This amiable community when their devotions were finished walked in procession to a spot where fireworks had been prepared and it being considered as a mark of honour to light the fireworks the office was reserved for Mons le Curé who however insisted on the participation of the Protestant Minister in this distinction upon which the Minister received a wax taper from the Curé and with him led the procession The fireworks represented two trees one twisted and distorted was emblematical of aristocracy and was soon entirely consumed when a tall strait plant figurative of patriotism appeared to rise from the ashes of the former and continued to burn with undiminished splendour  When we look back on the ignorance the superstition the barbarous persecutions of Gothic times is it not something to be thankful for that we exist at this enlightened period when such evils are no more when particular tenets of religious belief are no longer imputed as crimes when the human mind has made as many important discoveries in morality as in science and liberality of sentiment is cultivated with as much success as arts and learning when in short and  you  are not one of those who will suspect that I am not all the while a good English woman when one can witness an event so sublime as the French revolution  LETTER IX  YESTERDAY I received your letter in which you accuse me of describing with too much enthusiasm the public rejoicings in France and prophesy that I shall return to my own country a fierce republican In answer to these accusasations I shall observe that it is very difficult with common sensibility to avoid sympathising in general happiness My love of the French revolution is the natural result of this sympathy and therefore my political creed is entirely an affair of the heart for I have not been so absurd as to consult my head upon matters of which it is so incapable of judging If I were at Rome you would not be surprised to hear that I had visited with the warmest reverence every spot where any  relics of her ancient grandeur could be traced that I had flown to the capitol that I had kissed the earth on which the Roman senate sat in council And can you then expect me to have seen the Federation at the Champ de Mars and the National Assembly of France with indifference Before you insist that I ought to have done so point out to me in the page of Roman history a spectacle more solemn more affecting than the Champ de Mars exhibited or more magnanimous more noble efforts in the cause of liberty than have been made by the National Assembly Whether the new form of government establishing in France be more or less perfect than our own  Who shall decide when doctors disagree  And soundest casuists doubt like you and me  I fancy we had better leave the determination of this question in the hands of posterity In the mean time I wish that  some of our political critics would speak with less contempt than they are apt to do of the new constitution of France and no longer repeat after one another the trite remark that the French have gone too far because they have gone farther than ourselves as if it were not possible that that degree of influence which is perfectly safe in the hand of the executive part of our government might be dangerous at this crisis to the liberty of France but be this as it may it appears evident that the temple of Freedom which they are erecting even if imperfect in some of its proportions must be preferable to the old gloomy Gothic fabric which they have laid in ruins And therefore when I hear my good countrymen who guard their own rights with such unremitting vigilance and who would rather part with life than liberty speak with contempt of the French for having imbibed the noble lesson which England has taught I cannot  but suspect that some mean jealousy lurks beneath the ungenerous censure I cannot but suspect that while the fair and honourable traders of our commercial country act with the most liberal spirit in their ordinary dealings with other nations they wish to make a monopoly of liberty and are angry that France should claim a share of that precious property by which however she may surely be enriched without our being impoverished The French on the contrary seem to have imbibed with the principles of liberty the strongest sentiments of respect and friendship towards that people whom they gratefully acknowledge to have been their masters in this science They are to use their own phrase  Become madly fond of the English  "devenus fous des Anglois" and fondly imagine that the applause they have received from a society of philosophers in our country is the general voice of the nation  Whether the new constitution be composed of durable materials or not I leave to politicans to determine but it requires no extraordinary sagacity to pronounce that the French will henceforth be free The love of liberty has pervaded all ranks of the people who if its blessings must be purchased with blood will not shrink from paying the price  While ev'n the peasant boasts his rights to scan  And learns to venerate himself as man  The enthusiastic spirit of liberty displays itself not merely on the days of solemn ceremoniesoccupies not only every serious deliberationbut is mingled with the gaiety of social enjoyment When they converse liberty is the theme of discourse when they dance the figure of the cotillon is adapted to a national tune and when they sing it is but to repeat a vow of fidelity to the constitution at which all who are present instantly  join in chorus and sportively lift up their hands in confirmation of this favourite sentiment  In every street you see children performing the military exercise and carrying banners made of paper of the national colours wearing grenadiers caps of the same composition and armed though not like Jack the Giantkiller with swords of sharpness  Upon the whole Liberty appears in France adorned with the freshness of youth and is loved with the ardour of passion In England she is seen in her matron state and like other ladies at that period is beheld with sober veneration  With respect to myself I must acknowledge that in my admiration of the revolution in France I blend the feelings of private friendship with my sympathy in public blessings since the old constitution is connected in my mind with the image of a friend confined in the  gloomy recesses of a dungeon and pining in hopeless captivity while with the new constitution I unite the soothing idea of his return to prosperity honours and happiness  This person is Mons du F  whose lady I am come to France to visit They are friends with whom I wept in the day of their adversity and with whom in their prosperity I have hastened to rejoice Their history is most affecting and when I leave the hurry of Paris to accompany them to their Château in Normandy I will make you acquainted with incidents as pathetic as romance itself can furnish  Adieu  LETTER X  WE have been driving at a furious rate for several days past through the city of Paris which I think bears the same resemblance to London if you will allow me the indulgence of a simile that the grand natural objects in a rude and barren country bear to the tame but regular beauties of a scene rich with cultivation The streets of Paris are narrow dark and dirty but we are repaid for this by noble edifices which powerfully interest the attention The streets of London are broad airy light and elegant but I need not tell you that they lead scarcely to any edifices at which foreigners do not look with contempt London has therefore most of the beautiful and Paris of the sublime according to Mr Burke's definition  of these qualities for I assure you a sensation of terror is not wanting to the sublimity of Paris while the coachman drives through the streets with the impetuosity of a Frenchman and one expects every step the horses take to be fatal to the footpassengers who are heard exclaiming  That the streets of Paris are aristocrates  "Que les rues de Paris sont aristocrates" By the way  aristocratie  and  à la nation  are become cant terms which as Sterne said of  tant pis  and  tant mieux  may now be considered as two of the great hinges in French conversation Every thing tiresome or unpleasant "c'est une aristocratie" and every thing charming and agreeable is "à la nation"  I have seen all the fine buildings at Paris and fancy I should have admired the  façade  of the Louvre the beautiful new church of St Genevieve and some other edifices even if I had not been  told previously by a connoisseur in these matters the precise degree of admiration which it was proper to bestow on every public building in Paris but having received such minute instructions on this subject I can form but an imperfect notion of my own taste for architecture  At the request of Madame Brulart Mons de Chartres sent orders for our admission to the Palais Royal which is not at present shewn to the public Of the collection of pictures I am incapable of saying any thing and enough has been already said by those who understand its merits Fine painting gives me considerable pleasure but has not the power of calling forth my sensibility like fine poetry and I am willing to believe that the art I love is the most perfect of the two and that it would have been impossible for the pencil of Raphael to convey all those ideas to the mind and excite all  those emotions in the heart which are awakened by the pen of Shakespeare  I confess the only picture in Paris which has cost me any tears is that of La Valliere in the convent of the Carmelites She is represented in the habit of a Carmelite all the former ornaments of her person lie scattered at her feet and her eyes are cast up to heaven with a look of the deepest anguish While I gazed at her picture I lamented that sensibility which led into the most fatal errors a mind that seems to have been formed for virtue and which even in the bosom of pleasure bewailed its own weakness How can one forbear regretting that the capricious inconstant monarch to whom she gave her heart should have inspired a passion of which he was so unworthy a passion which appears to have been wholly unmixed with interest vanity or ambition And how can one avoid pitying  the desolate penitent who for so many years in the dismal gloom of a convent deplored her errors and felt at once the bitterness of remorse and the agony of disappointed love while probably  In every hymn she seem'd his voice to hear  And dropp'd with every bead too soft a tear  If the figure of this beautiful Carmelite had not come across my imagination I should have told you sooner that the Palais Royal is a square of which the Due d'Orieans's palace forms one side You walk under piazzas round this square which is surrounded with coffeehouses and shops displaying a variety of ribbons trinkets and caricature prints which are now as common at Paris as at London The walks under the piazzas are crowded with people and in the upper part of the square tents are placed where coffee lemonade ices c are sold Nothing is heard but the voice of mirth nothing is seen but cheerful faces and I have no  doubt that the Palais Royal is upon the whole one of the merriest scenes under the sun Indeed what is most striking to a stranger at Paris is that general appearance of gaiety which it is easy to perceive is not assumed for the moment but is the habit of the mind and which is therefore so exhilarating to a spectator of any benevolence It is this which gives such a charm to every public place and walk in Paris Kensington Gardens can boast as fine verdure as majestic trees as noble walks and perhaps more beautiful women than the gardens of the Tuilleries but we shall look in vain for that sprightly animation that everlasting cheerfulness which render the Tuilleries so enchanting  We have just returned from the Hôpital des Invalides a noble building adorned with fine paintings which record the history of some celebrated saints whose exploits were recounted with incredible  rapidity by the man who conducted us through the chapels and who seemed to think that nothing could be more absurd than our curiosity after having heard these stories from his lips to observe how they were told by the painters  As we passed through the church we saw several old soldiers kneeling at the confessionals with that solemn devotion which seemed undisturbed by our intrusion and fixed upon "the things that are above"  A few days before the taking of the Bastille a crowd of the Parisians assembled at the Hôpital des Invalides and demanded arms of the old soldiers who answered that they were the friends of their fellowcitizens but durst not deliver up their arms without the appearance of a contest and therefore desired that the people would assemble before the gates in greater numbers the next day when  after firing a little powder upon them they would throw down their arms The people accordingly returned the following day and the invalids after a faint show of resistance threw down their arms which the citizens took up embraced the old men and then departed  We stopped yesterday at La Maison de Ville and went into a large apartment where the mayor and corporation assemble The walls are hung round with pictures of Kings and Dukes which I looked at with much less respect than at the chair on which Mons Bailly sits If his picture should ever be placed in this apartment I fancy that in the estimation of posterity it will obtain precedency over all the Princes in the collection  As we came out of La Maison de Ville we were shewn immediately opposite the farfamed  The lampiron  lanterne  at which for want of a gallows the first victims  of popular fury were sacrificed I own that the sight of  la lanterne  chilled the blood within my veins At that moment for the first time I lamented the revolution and forgetting the imprudence or the guilt of those unfortunate men could only reffect with horror on the dreadful expiation they had made I painted in my imagination the agonies of their families and friends nor could I for a considerable time chase these gloomy images from my thoughts  It is for ever to be regretted that so dark a shade of ferocious revenge was thrown across the glories of the revolution But alas where do the records of history point out a revolution unstained by some actions of barbarity When do the passions of human nature rise to that pitch which produces great events without wandering into some irregularities If the French revolution should cost no farther bloodshed it must be allowed  notwithstanding a few shocking instances of public vengeance that the liberty of twentyfour millions of people will have been purchased at a far cheaper rate than could ever have been expected from the former experience of the world  LETTER XI  WE are just returned from Versailles where I could not help fancying I saw in the back ground of that magnificent abode of a despot the gloomy dungeons of the Bastille which still haunt my imagination and prevented my being much dazzled by the splendour of this superb palace  We were shewn the passages through which the Queen escaped from her own apartment to the King's on the memorable night when the  Poissardes  visited Versailles and also the balcony at which she stood with the Dauphin in her arms when after having remained a few hours concealed in some secret recess of the palace it was thought proper to comply with the desire of the crowd who repeatedly  demanded her presence I could not help moralizing a little on being told that the apartment to which this balcony belongs is the very room in which Louis the Fourteenth died little suspecting what a scene would in the course of a few years be acted on that spot  All the bread which could be procured in the town of Versailles was distributed among the  Poissardes  who with savage ferocity held up their morsels of bread on their bloody pikes towards the balcony where the Queen stood crying in a tone of defiance  We now have bread  "Nous avons du pain"  During the whole of the journey from Versailles to Paris the Queen held the Dauphin in her arms who had been previously taught to put his infant hands together and attempt to soften the enraged multitude by repeating  Spare mama  "Grace pour maman"  Mons de la Fayette prevented the whole Gardes du Corps from being massacred at Versailles by calling to the incensed people  The King begs of you to spare his bodyguards  Le Roi vous demande grace pour ses Gardes du Corps  The voice of Mons de la Fayette was listened to and obeyed The Gardes du Corps were spared with whom before they set out for Paris the people exchanged clothes giving them also national cockades and as a farther protection from danger part of the crowd mounted on the horses of the Gardes du Corps each man taking an officer behind him Before the King came out of La Maison de Ville Mons de la Fayette appeared and told the multitude who had preserved an indignant silence the whole way from Versailles to Paris that the King had expressed sentiments of the strongest affection for his people and had accepted the national cockade and that he Mons  de la Fayette hoped when his Majesty came out of La Maison de Ville they would testify their gratitude In a few minutes the King appeared and was received with the loudest acclamations  When the Queen was lately asked to give her deposition on the attempt which it is said was made to assassinate her by the  Poissardes  at Versailles she answered with great prudence  I saw every thing heard every thing and have forgot every thing  Jai tout vu tout entendu tout oublié  The King is now extremely popular and the people sing in the streets to the old tune of  Long live Henry the Fourth Long live Lewis the Sixteenth  "Vive Henri Quatre" c "Vive Louis Seize"  The Queen is I am told much altered lately in her appearance but she is still a fine woman Madame is a beautiful girl and the Dauphin who is about seven years of age is the idol of the people They  expect that he will be educated in the principles of the new constitution and will be taught to consider himself less a king than a citizen He appears to be a sweet engaging child and I have just heard one of his sayings repeated He has a collection of animals which he feeds with his own hand A few days ago an ungrateful rabbit who was his first favourite bit his finger when he was giving him food The Prince while smarting with the pain called out to his  Little rabbit Thou art an AristocrateAnd pray my Lord what is an AristocrateThose who make my papa uneasy  petit lapin    Tu es Aristocrate  One of the attendants inquired  Eh Monseigneur qu'estce que c'est qu'un Aristocrate  Ce sont ceux  answered the Prince  qui font de la peine à Papa  The King lately called the Queen  en badinage  Madame Capet to which she retorted very readily by giving his Majesty  the appellation of "Monsieur  Capot  is the French term at picquet when the game is lost  Capot  "  When  les Gardes Françoises  laid down their arms at Versailles their officers endeavoured to persuade them to take them up An officer of my acquaintance told me that he said to his soldiers  My friends you are going then to forsake me I possess nore of your affectionCaptain they answered we all love you and if you will lead us against our enemies we are all ready to follow you but we will never fire at our fellowcitizens  Mes enfans vous allez done me quitter vous ne m'aimez plus  Mon officier  they answered  nous vous aimons tous s'il s'agit d'aller contre nos ennemis nous sommes tous prêts à vous suivre mais nous ne tirerons iamais contre nos compatriotes  Since that period whenever any of  les Gardes Françoises  appear they are followed by the acclamations of the  people and  Long live the French Guards  Vivent les Gardes Françoises  resounds from every quarter  While we were sitting after dinner at the inn at Versailles the door was suddenly opened and a Franciscan friar entered the room He had so strong a resemblance to Sterne's monk that I am persuaded he must be a descendant of the same family We could not like Sterne bestow immortality but we gave some alms and the venerable old monk after thanking us with affecting simplicity added spreading out his hands with a slow and solemn movement  Peace be with you  Que la paix soit avec vous  and then departed I have been frequently put in mind of Sterne since my arrival in France and the first postboy I saw in jackboots appeared to me a very classical figure by recalling the idea of La Fleur mounted on his  bidet  LETTER XII  WE have been at all the Theatres and I am charmed with the comic actors The tragic performers afforded me much less pleasure Before we can admire Madame Vestris the first tragic actress of Paris we must have lost the impression a thing impossible of Mrs Siddons's performance who instead of "tearing a passion to rags" like Madame Vestris only tears the hearts of the audience with sympathy  Most of the pieces we have seen at the French theatres have been little comedies relative to the circumstances of the times and on that account preferred in this moment of enthusiasm to all the wit of Moliere These little pieces might perhaps read coldly enough in your study  but have a most charming effect with an accompaniment of applause from some hundreds of the national guards the real actors in the scenes represented Between the acts national songs are played in which the whole audience join in chorus There is one air in particular which is so universal a favourite that it is called  le Carillon National  the burden of the song is  It will go on  "ÇA IRA" It is sung not only at every theatre and in every street of Paris but in every town and village of France by man woman and child "ÇA IRA" is every where the signal of pleasure the beloved sound which animates every bosom with delight and of which every ear is enamoured and I have heard the most serious political conversations end by a sportive assurance in allusion to this song  que  "ÇA IRA"  Giornowiche the celebrated player on the violin who was so much the fashion  last winter at London I am told sometimes amused himself at Paris by getting up into one of the trees of the Palais Royal after it was dark and calling forth tones from his violin fit to "take the prison'd soul and lap it in Elysium" He has frequently detained some thousands of people half the night in the Palais Royal who before they discovered the performer used to call out in rapture  Bravo bravo  This is better than Giornowiche  c'est mieux que Giornowiche  I am just returned from seeing the Gobeiin tapestry which appears the work of magic It gave me pleasure to see two pictures of Henry the Fourth In one he is placed at supper with the miller's family and in the other he is embracing Sully who is brought forward on a couch after having been wounded in battle Nothing has afforded me more delight since I came to France than the  honours which are paid to my favourite hero Henry the Fourth whom I prefer to all the Alexanders and Fredericks that ever existed They may be terribly sublime if you will and have great claims to my admiration but as for my love all that portion of it which I bestow on heroes is already in Henry's possession  Little statues of Henry the Fourth and Sully are very common Sully is represented kneeling at the feet of this amiable Prince who holds out his hand to him and on the base of the statue are written the words which Sully records in his Memoirs  But rise pray rise Sully they will believe I am forgiving you  Mais levezvous levezvous donc Sully on croiroit que je vous pardonne  While the statue of Henry the Fourth on the PontNeuf is illuminated and decorated with national ribbon that of Louis  the Fourteenth in the Place Victoire is stripped of its former ostentatious ornaments the nations which were represented enchained at his feet having been removed since the revolution The figure of Fame is however still left hovering behind the statue of the King with a crown of laurel in her hand which it is generally supposed she is going to place upon his head But I have heard of a French wit who inquired whether it was really her intention to place the laurel on his Majesty's head or whether she had just taken it off  In our ride this morning we stopped at the Place Royale where I was diverted by reading on the front of a little shop under the piazzas these words  Robelin  WriterMemoirs and letters written at a moderate price for the Nation  écrivainMémoires lettres écrites à juste prix à la nation  I am  told that Mons Robelin is in very flourishing business and perhaps I might have had recourse to him for assistance in my correspondence with you if I did not leave Paris tomorrow You shall hear from me from Rouen  LETTER XIII  WE had a most agreeable journey from Paris to Rouen travelling a hundred miles along the borders of the Seine through a beautiful country richly wooded and finely diversified by hill and valley We passed several magnificent  châteaux  and saw many a spire belonging to Gothic edifices which it would seem were built of such lasting materials with the moral purpose of leading the mind to reflect on the comparatively short duration of human life Frequently an old venerable cross placed at the side of the road by the piety of remote ages and never passed by Roman Catholics without some mark of respect throws a kind of religious sanctity over the landscape  We stopped to look at the immense  machine which conveys water to Versailles and Marly The water is raised by means of this machine sixty feet and is carried the distance of five hundred I never heard a sound which filled my mind with more horror than the noise occasioned by the movements of this tremendous machine while at the same time the vast chasms where the water foams with angry violence make the brain giddy and I was glad to leave these images of terror  Part of our journey was performed by moonlight which slept most sweetly upon the bank and spread over the landscape those softened graces which I will not attempt to describe lest my pen should stray into rhyme  We passed the  chateau  of Rosni a noble domain given to Sully by Henry the Fourth a testimony of that friendship which reflects equal honour on the King and the Minister  About three leagues from Rouen stands a convent of which Abelard was for some time the Superior It is still inhabited by a few monks and is called  Le Couvent de deux Amans  Had it been the monastery of the Paraclete the residence of Eloïsa I should have hastened to visit the spot  Where o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves  Long sounding isles and intermingled graves  Black Melancholy sits and round her throws  A deathlike silence and a dread repose  Her gloomy presence saddens all the seene  Shades ev'ry flow'r and darkens ev'ry green  Deepens the murmur of the falling floods  And breathes a browner horror on the woods  If it were not very difficult to be angry with such a poet as Pope particularly after having just transcribed these exquisite lines I should be so when I recollect how clearly Mr Berington shews in his History of Abelard and Eloïsa the cruel injustice done by Pope to the sentiments of Eloïsa who is too often made to speak a very different language in the poem from that of her genuine letters  On our way to Rouen we slept at Gallon a town about five leagues distant Our inn was close to the castle which formerly belonged to the Archbishop of Rouen and which is now the property of the nation The castle is a venerable Gothic building with a fine orangery and parks which extend several leagues The Archbishop who is the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault brother to that distinguished patriot the  cidevant  Duc de la Rochefoucault has lost a very considerable revenue since the revolution He had an immense train of servants whom it is said he dismissed upon the diminution of his income with all possible gentleness giving horses to one a carriage to another and endeavouring to bestow on all some little alleviation of the pain they felt at quitting so good a master It is impossible not to regret that the property of the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault  is diminished by whom it was only employed in dispensing happiness  After visiting the castle I returned somewhat in mournful mood to the inn where there was nothing calculated to convey one cheerful idea The cieling of our apartment was crossed with old bare beams the tapestry with which the room was hung displayed like the dress of Otway's old woman "variety of wretchedness" the canopied beds were of coarse dirty stuff two pictures in tawdry gilt frames slandered the sweet countenances of the Dauphin and Madame and the floor was paved with brick In short one can scarcely imagine a scene more remote from England in accommodation and comfort than the country inns of France yet in this habitation where an Englishman would have been inclined to hang himself was my rest disturbed half the night by the  merry songs which were sung in an adjoining apartment as gloomy as my own But those local circumstances which affect English nerves never disturb the peace of that happy people by whom whether engaged in taking the Bastille or sitting with their friends after supper  Every thing is done singing  tout se fait en chantant  LETTER XIV  ROUEN is one of the largest and most commercial towns of France It is situated on the banks of the Seine has a fine quay and a singular bridge of barges placed close together with planks fixed upon them the bridge rises and sinks with the tide and opens for vessels to pass  The streets of Rouen are so narrow dark and frightful that to borrow an expression from Madame Sevigné  "They abuse the permission the French streets have of being ugly"  elles abusent de la permission qu'ont les rues Francoises d'être laides  There are many figures of Saints to be seen from these ugly streets placed in little niches in the walls The Virgin Mary is seated  in one of these niches with the infant in her arms and in the neighbourhood is St Anne who has the credit of having taught the Virgin to read Every night the general darkness of the town is a little dispelled by the lamps which the people place in the niches  "To light the Saints"  "pour éclairer les Saints"  Rouen is surrounded by fine  boulevards  that form very beautiful walks On the top of the hill of S  te  Catharine which overlooks the town are the ruins of a fort called St Michell from which Henry the Fourth besieged Rouen I love to be put in mind of Henry the Fourth and am therefore very well pleased that whenever I go to walk I can fix my eyes on the hill of S  te  Catharine  I always feel a little ashamed of my country when I pass the spot where the Maid of Orleans was executed and on  which her statue stands a monument of our disgrace The ashes of her persecutor John Duke of Bedford repose at no great distance within a tomb of black marble in the cathedral which was built by the English One cannot feel much respect for the judgment of our ancestors in choosing of all places under the sun the cathedral of Rouen for the tomb of him whose name is transmitted to us with the epithet of the  good  Duke of Bedford for you have scarcely left the cathedral before the statue of Jean d'Arc stares you in the face and seems to cast a most formidable shade over the  good  Duke's virtues  The cathedral is a very magnificent edifice and the great bell is ten feet high and weighs thirtysix thousand pounds But in France it is not what is  ancient  but what is  modern  that most powerfully engages attention Nothing in this fine old cathedral interested me so much as  the consecrated banner which since the Federation has been placed over the altar and on which is inscribed "  Let us live free or die  Vivons libres ou mourons" I hope every Frenchman who enters the cathedral of Rouen while he reads the inscription on the consecrated banner repeats from the bottom of his soul "  Let us live free or die  Vivons libres ou mourons" But the French will I trust escape the horrors of civil war notwithstanding the gloomy forebodings of the enemies of the new constitution  A people just delivered from the yoké of oppression will surely have little inclination to resume their shackles to rebuild the dungeons they have so lately demolished to close again those gloomy monastic gates which are now thrown open to exchange their new courts of judicature founded on the basis of justice and humanity for the caprice of power  and the dark iniquity of  lettresdecachet  to quench the fair star of liberty which has arisen on their hemisphere and suffer themselves to be once more guided by the meteor of despotism  A very considerable number even among the Nobility of France have had the virtue to support the cause of freedom and forgetting the little considerations of vanity which have some importance in the ordinary course of human affairs but which are lost and annihilated when the mind is animated by any great sentiment they have chosen to become the benefactors rather than the oppressors of their country the citizens of a free State instead of the slaves of a despotic Monarch They will no longer bear arms to gratify the ambition or the caprice of a Minister they will no longer exert that impetuous and gallant spirit for which they have ever been distinguished in any cause unworthy of its efforts The  fire of valour which they have too often employed for the purposes of destruction will henceforth be directed to more generous ends They will choose another path to renown Instead of attempting to take the citadel of glory by storm they will prefer the fame of an honourable defence and renouncing the sanguinary laurel strive with more exalted enthusiasm to obtain the civic wreath Yes the French nation will inviolably guard will transmit to posterity the sacred rights of freedom Future ages will celebrate with grateful commemoration the fourteenth of July and strangers when they visit France will hasten with impatience to the Champ de Mars filled with that enthusiasm which is awakened by the view of a place where any great scene has been acted I think I hear them exclaim "Here the Federation was held here an assembled nation devoted themselves to freedom" I fancy I see them pointing out the spot on  which the altar of the country stood I see them eagerly searching for the place where they have heard it recorded that the National Assembly were seated I think of these things and then repeat to myself with transport "  I  was a spectator of the Federation"  But these meditations have led me to travel through the space of so many centuries that it is really difficult to get back again to the present times Did you expect that I should ever dip my pen in politics who used to take so small an interest in public affairs that I recollect a gentleman of my acquaintance surprised me not a little by informing me of the war between the Turks and the Russians at a time when all the people of Europe except myself had been two years in possession of this intelligence  If however my love of the French revolution requires an apology you shall receive one in a very short time for I  am going to Mons du F  's  château  and will send you from thence the history of his misfortunes They were the inflictions of tyranny and you will rejoice with me that tyranny is no more  Before I close my letter I shall mention a singular privilege of the church of Rouen which is the power of setting free a murdered every year on the day of Ascension It seems that in the time of King Dagobert who reigned in the sixth century a horrible and unrelenting dragon desolated the country sparing neither man nor beast St Romain who was then bishop of Rouen asked for two criminals to assist him in an enterprise he had the courage to meditate against the dragon and with these  aidesdecamp  he sallied forth killed the monster and delivered the country In consequence of this miracle Dagobert gave the successors of St Romain the privilege of setting a murderer free every year on Ascensionday  The bones of St Romain are carried by the criminal in a gilt box through the streets the figure of a hideous animal representing the dragon though it is suspected of slandering his countenance accompanies these venerable bones and has generally a young living wolf placed in its maw except when it is  Fastday  jour maigre  and then the dragon is provided with a large fish The counsellors of the parliament dressed in their scarlet robes attend this procession to a church where high mass is said and these ceremonies being performed the criminal is set at liberty but it is only where there are some strong alleviating circumstances in the case of the offender that he is suffered in this manner to evade the punishment of his crimes  Yesterday in a little town called Sotte Ville joined to Rouen by the bridge a political dispute arose between the Curé  and his parishioners The enraged Curé exclaimed  You are an assembly of asses  "Vous êtes une assemblée d'ânes" to which one of the parishioners answered with great calmness  Yes Sir and you are our preacher  "Oui Mons le Curé vous en êtes le pasteur"  LETTER XV  I HEARD  The military mass  la messe militaire  on Sunday last at a church where all the national guard of Rouen attended The service began with the loudest thunder of drums and trumpets and seemed more like a signal for battle than for devotion but the music soon softened into the most soothing sounds which flowed from the organ clarinets flutes and hautboys the priests chaunted and the people made responses The wax tapers were lighted holy water was sprinkled on the ground incense was burnt at the altar and the elevation of the Host was announced by the sound of the drum upon which the people knelt down and the priest prostrated his face towards the earth There  is something affecting in the pomp and solemnities of these ceremonies Indeed the Roman Catholic worship though a sad stumblingblock to reason is striking to the imagination I have more than once heard the service for the dead performed and never can hear it without emotion without feeling that in those melancholy separations which bury every hope of the survivor in the relentless grave the heart than can delude itself with the belief that his prayers may avail any thing to the departed object of its affections must find consolation in thus uniting a tribute of tenderness with the performance of a religious duty  We have been at several convents at Rouen The first to which we went was a convent of Benedictine Nuns When we had entered the gates we rang a bell and a servant appeared and desired us to go up stairs to the parloir We opened a wrong door and found in a room  grated across the middle with iron bars a young man sitting on one side of the grate and a young nun on the other I could not help thinking that the heart of this young man was placed in a perilous situation for where can a young woman appear so interesting as when seen within that gloomy barrier which death alone can remove What is there in all the ostentation of female dress so likely to affect a man of sensibility as that dismal habit which seems so much at variance with youth and beauty and is worn as the melancholy symbol of an eternal renunciation of the world and all its pleasures We made an apology to the nun for our intrusion and she directed us to another apartment where a few minutes after we had seated ourselves on one side of the grate La Dépositaire entered on the other and told us that the Abbess whom we had desired to see was not yet risen from dinner and La Dépositaire hoped  we would wait a little  Because said she the Abbess was obliged to rise from table very soon yesterday and found herself a little indisposed  Parce que  said she  Madame l'Abbesse étoit obligée hier de se lever de table de bonne heure elle se trouvoit un peu incommodée  You must observe that the Abbess dined at three o'clock and it was now past six At length this lady who was so fond of long dinners appeared She is a woman of fifty but is still handsome has a frank agreeable countenance fine eyes and had put on her veil in a very becoming manner We wished to be admitted to the interior part of the convent and with this view a French gentleman who was of our party  Told a great many fables to the Abbess  se mit à conter des histoires à Madame l'Abbesse  He told her that my sister and I though English women were Catholics and wished  to be received into the convent and even if it had been possible to take the vows The Abbess inquired if he was quite sure of our being Catholics upon which the gentleman a little puzzled what to answer insinuated that Mons du F  had probably the merit of our conversion  But I have heard  said the Abbess  from Madame  that Mons du F  has become a Protestant himself  Mons du F  who is truth itself avowed his principles without hesitation while the Abbess turning to La Dépositaire exclaimed  How amiable he is what noble sentiments Ah Sir you are too good for God to leave you in error  Mais comme Monsieur estaimable quels beaux sentimens Ah Monsieur vous êtes trop bon pour que Dieu vous laisse dans l'erreur  St Augustin  continued she  had once some doubts I hope you will be a second St Augustin myself and all my community  will pray for your conversion  La Dépositaire who was a tall thin old woman with a sharp malignant countenance added casting a look on Mons du F  full of the contempt of superior knowledge  It is not surprising that a young man after passing several years in England that country of heretics should find his faith somewhat shaken but he only wants to be enlightened by Mons le Curé de  who will immediately dissipate all his doubts  From the convent of the Benedictines we went to that of the Carmelites where religion which was meant to be a source of happiness in this world as well as in the next wears an aspect of the most gloomy horror When we entered the convent it seemed the residence of silence and solitude no voice was heard no human creature appeared and when we rang the bell a person whom we could not see inquired through a hole in the wall  what we wanted On being informed that we wished to speak to the Supérieure putting her hand through the hole she gave us a key and desired us to unlock the door of the parloir This we accordingly did and in a few minutes the Supérieure came to a thick double grate with a curtain drawn at the inside to prevent the possibility of being seen Our French gentleman again talked of our desire to enter the convent and begged to know the rules A hollow voice answered that the Carmelites rose at four in the morning in summer and five in the winter"Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep"That they slept in their coffins upon straw and every morning dug a shovelfull of earth for their graves that they walked to their devotional exercises upon their knees that when any of their friends visited them if they spoke they were not suffered to be seen or if they were seen they were not  suffered to speak that with them it was  Always a fast  toujours maigre  and they only tasted food twice a day  Our Frenchman said  These young ladies Madam must consider whether these regulations will suit them  Il faut Madame que ces demoiselles réfléchissent si cela leur convient  The poor Carmelite agreed that the matter required some reflexion and we departed  As we returned home meditating on the lot of a Carmelite we met in the street three nuns walking in the habit of their order Upon inquiry we were told that they had been forced by their parents to take the veil and since the decree of the National Assembly giving them liberty they had obtained permission to pay a visit for three months to some friends who sympathised in their unhappiness and were now on their journey  The monks and nuns must in a short  time decide whether they will finally leave their cloisters or not and the religious houses which are vacated will be sold In the department of Rouen a calculation has been made that after paying every monk seven hundred and every nun five hundred livres a year out of the revenues of the religious houses the department will gain sixty thousand livres a year The monks and nuns above sixty years of age who choose to leave their convents will be allowed an annual pension of nine hundred livres  A letter was read in the National Assembly a few days ago from a priest intreating that the clergy might have permission to marry a privilege which it is thought the Assembly will soon authorise  They have overturned every thing  "On a bouleversé tout" said an old Curé a fierce Aristocrate with whom I was in company  And would even carry the profanation so far as to suffer the priests to marry  même on veut  porter la profanation si loin que de marier les prêtres  It is conjectured however that the younger part of the clergy think of this measure with less horror than the old Curé  We arrived last night at Mons du F  's  château  without having visited during our stay at Rouen the tomb of William the Conqueror who is buried at Caen a town thirty leagues distant But I have been too lately at the Champ de Mars to travel twelve leagues in order to see the tomb of a tyrant  Upon Mons du F  's arrival at the  château  all his tenants with their wives and daughters came to pay their respects to Monseigneur and were addressed by Monsieur and Madame with those endearing epithets which give such a charm to the French language and are so much more rejoicing to the heart than our form appellations Here a peasant girl is termed by the lady of the  château    My good friend My little girl My child  Ma bonne amie Ma petite Mon enfant  while those pretty monosyllables  Thou thy c  tu    ta  c used only to the nearest relations and to servants impress the mind with the idea of that affectionate familiarity which so gracefully softens the distance of situation and excites in the dependant not presumption but gratitude  And how do you do La Voie  Et comment te portestu La Voie  said Mons du F  to one of his farmers  Pretty well my Lord but I had a fever last Easter at your service  Assez bien Monseigneur  replied he  mais j'eus la fièvre à Pâques à votre service  LETTER XVI  I EMBRACE the first hours of leisure which I have found since my arrival at the  château  to send you the history of my friends  Augustin Francois Thomas du F  eldest son of the Baron du F  Counsellor of the Parliament of Normandy was born on the fifteenth of July His early years were embittered by the severity of his father who was of a disposition that preferred the exercise of domestic tyranny to the blessings of social happiness and chose rather to be dreaded than beloved The endearing name of father conveyed no transport to  his  heart which being wrapt up in stern insensibility was cold even to the common feelings of nature  The Baron's austerity was not indeed confined to his son but extended to all his dependants Formed by nature for the support of the ancient government of France he maintained his aristocratic rights with unrelenting severity ruled his feudal tenures with a rod of iron and considered the lower order of people as a set of beings whose existence was tolerated merely for the use of the nobility The poor he believed were only born for suffering and he determined as far as in him lay not to deprive them of their natural inheritance On the whole if it were the great purpose of human life to be hated perhaps no person ever attained that end more completely than the Baron du F    His son discovered early a taste for literature and received an education suitable to his rank and fortune As he advanced in life the treatment he experienced from his father became more and  more intolerable to him as far from inheriting the same character he possessed the most amiable dispositions and the most feeling heart  His mother feeble alike in mind and body submitted with the helplessness and almost with the thoughtlessness of a child to the imperious will of her husband Their family was increased by two more sons and two daughters but these children being several years younger than Mons du F  were not of an age to afford him the consolations of friendship and the young man would have found his situation intolerable but for the sympathy of a person in whose society every evil was forgotten  This person his attachment to whom has tinctured the colour of his life was the youngest of eight children of a respectable family of Bourgeois at Rouen There is great reason to believe that her father was descended from the younger  branch of a noble family of the same name and bearing the same arms But unhappily some links were wanting in this chain of honourable parentage The claim to nobility could not be traced to the entire satisfaction of the Baron who though he would have dispensed with any moral qualities in favour of rank considered obscure birth as a radical stain which could not be wiped off by all the virtues under Heaven He looked upon marriage as merely a convention of interest and children as a property of which it was reasonable for parents to make the most in their power  The father of M  lle  Monique C  was a farmer and died three months before the birth of this child who with seven other children was educated with the utmost care by their mother a woman of sense and virtue beloved by all to whom she was known It seemed as if this respectable woman had after the  death of her husband only supported life for the sake of her infant family from whom she was snatched by death the moment her maternal cares became no longer necessary her youngest daughter Monique having at this period just attained her twentieth year Upon the death of her mother Monique went to live with an aunt with whom she remained only a very short time being invited by Madame du F  to whom she was well known to come and live with her as an humble companion to read to her when she was disposed to listen and to enliven the sullen grandeur of the  château  by her animating vivacity  This young person had cultivated her excellent understanding by reading and her heart stood in no need of cultivation Mons du F  found in the charms of her conversation and in the sympathy of her friendship the most soothing consolation under the rigour of parental tyranny  Living several years beneath the same roof he had constant opportunities of observing her disposition and character and the passion with which she at length inspired him was founded on the lasting basis of esteem  If it was ever pardonable to deviate from that law in the code of interest and etiquette which forbids the heart to listen to its best emotions which stifling every generous sentiment of pure disinterested attachment sacrifices love at the shrine of avarice or ambition the virtues of Monique were such as might excuse this deviation Yes the character the conduct of this amiable person have nobly justified her lover's choice How long might he have vainly sought in the highest classes of society a mind so elevated above the common massa mind that endowed with the most exquisite sensibility has had sufficient sirmness to sustain with a calm and equal spirit every  transition of fortune the most severe trials of adversity and perhaps what is still more difficult to bear the trial of high prosperity  Mons du F  had been taught by his early misfortunes that domestic happiness was the first good of life He had already found by experience the insufficiency of rank and fortune to confer enjoyment and he determined to seek it in the bosom of conjugal felicity He determined to pass his life with her whose society now seemed essential not only to his happiness but to his very existence  At the solemn hour of midnight the young couple went to a church where they were met by a priest whom Mons du F  had made the confident of his attachment and by whom the marriage ceremony was performed  Some time after when the situation of his wife obliged Mons du F  to acknowledge their marriage to his mother  she assured her son that she would willingly consent to receive his wife as her daughter but for the dread of his father's resentment Madame du F  with tears of regret parted with Monique whom she placed under the protection of her brothers they conducted her to Caen where she was soon after delivered of a son  The Baron du F  was absent while these things were passing he had been suspected of being the author of a pamphlet written against the Princes of the Blood and an order was issued to seize his papers and conduct him to the Bastille but he found means to escape into Holland where he remained nearly two years Having made his peace with the Ministry he prepared to come home but before he returned Mons du F  received intelligence that his father irritated almost to madness by the information of his marriage was making application  for a  lettredecachet  in order to confine his daughterinlaw for the rest of her life and had also obtained power to have his son seized and imprisoned Upon this Mons du F  and his wife fled with precipitation to Geneva leaving their infant at nurse near Caen The Genevois seemed to think that the unfortunate situation of these strangers gave them a claim to all the offices of friendship After an interval of many years I have never heard Mons or Madame du F  recall the kindness they received from that amiable people without tears of tenderness and gratitude  Meanwhile the Baron having discovered the place of his son's retreat obtained in the name of the King permission from the Cantons of Berne and Friburg to arrest them at Lausanne where they had retired for some months The wife of le Seigneur Baillif secretly gave the young people notice of this design  and on the thirtieth of January they had just time to make their escape with only a few livres in their pockets and the clothes in which they were dressed Mons du F  upon his first going to Switzerland had lent thirty louis to a friend in distress He now in this moment of necessity desired to be repaid and was promised the money within a month mean time he and his wife wandered from town to town without finding any place where they could remain in security They had spent all their small stock of money and were almost without clothes but at the expiration of the appointed time the thirty louis were paid and with this fund Mons and Madame du F  determined to take shelter in the only country which could afford them a safe asylum from persecution and immediately set off for England travelling through Germany and part of Holland to avoid passing through France  They embarked at Rotterdam and after a long and gloomy passage arrived late at night at London An old and respectable man who was their fellowpassenger had the charity to procure them a lodging in a garret and directed them where to purchase a few readymade clothes When they had remained in this lodging the time necessary for becoming parishioners their banns were published in the church of St Anne Westminster where they were married by the Curate of the parish They then went to the chapel of the French Ambassador and were again married by his Chaplain after which Mons du F  told me  The newmarried couple kept a fast in their little apartment  Les deux époux vinrent faire maigre chère à leur petite chambre  Mons du F  endeavoured to obtain a situation at a school to teach the French language but before such a situation  could be found his wife was delivered of a girl Not having sufficient money to hire a nurse he attended her himself At this period they endured all the horrors of absolute want Unknown and unpitied without help or support in a foreign country and in the depth of a severe winter they almost perished with cold and hunger The unhappy mother lay stretched upon the same bed with her newborn infant who in vain implored her succour wood of food having dried up that source of nourishment The woman at whose house they lodged and whom they had for some weeks been unable to pay after many threatenings at length told them that they must depart the next morning Madame du F  was at this time scarcely able to walk across her chamber and the ground was covered with snow They had already exhausted every resource they had sold their watches their clothes to satisfy the cravings  of hunger every mode of relief was fledevery avenue of hope was closedand they determined to go with their infant to the suburbs of the town and there seated on a stone wait with patience for the deliverance of death With what anguish did this unfortunate couple prepare to leave their last miserable retreat With how many bitter tears did they bathe that wretched infant whom they could no longer save from perishing  Oh my dear my everbeloved friends when I recollect that I am not at this moment indulging the melancholy cast of my own disposition by painting imaginary distress when I recollect not only that these were real sufferings but that they were sustained by  you  my mind is overwhelmed with its own sensationsThe paper is blotted by my tearsand I can hold my pen no longer  LETTER XVII    Thomson  THE moral world  Which though to us it seem perplex'd moves on  In higher order fitted and impell'd  By Wisdom's finest hand and issuing all  In universal good  Mons and Madame du F  were relieved from this extremity of distress at a moment so critical and by means so unexpected that it seemed the hand of Heaven visibly interposing in behalf of oppressed virtue Early in the morning of that fatal day when they were to leave their last sad shelter Mons du F  went out and in the utmost distraction of mind wandered through some of the streets in the neighbourhood He was stopped by a gentleman whom he had known at Geneva and who told him that  he was then in search of his lodging having a letter to deliver to him from a Genevois clergyman Mons du F  opened the letter in which he was informed by his friend that fearing he might be involved in difficulties he had transmitted ten guineas to a banker in London and intreated Mons du F  would accept that small relief which was all he could afford as a testimony of friendship Mons du F  flew to the banker's received the money as the gift of Heaven and then hastening to his wife and child bade them live a little longer  A short time after he obtained a situation as French usher at a school and Madame du F  when she had a little recovered her strength put out her infant to nurse and procured the place of French teacher at a boardingschool They were now enabled to support their child and to repay the generous assistance of their kind friend at Geneva  Mons and Madame du F  passed two years in this situation when they were again plunged into the deepest distress A French jeweller was commissioned by the Baron du F  to go to his son and propose to him conditions of reconciliation This man told Mons du F  that his father was just recovered from a severe and dangerous illness and that his eldest daughter had lately died These things he said had led him to reflect with some pain on the severity he had exercised towards his son that the feelings of a parent were awakened in his bosom and that if Mons du F  would throw himself at his father's feet and ask forgiveness he would not fail to obtain it and would be allowed a pension on which he might live with his wife in England In confirmation of these assurances this man produced several letters which he had received from the Baron to that effect who  as a farther proof of his sincerity had given this agent seven hundred pounds to put into the hands of Mons du F  for the support of his wife and child during his absence The agent told him that he had not been able to bring the money to England but would immediately give him three draughts upon a merchant of reputation in London with whom he had connexions in business the first draught payable in three months the second in six and the third in nine  Mons du F  long deliberated upon these proposals He knew too well the vindictive spirit of his father not to feel some dread of putting himself into his power But his agent continued to give him the most solemn assurances of safety and Mons du F  thought it was not improbable that his sister's death might have softened the mind of his father He reflected that his marriage had disappointed  those ambitious hopes of a great alliance which his father had fondly indulged and to whom he owed at least the reparation of hastening to implore his forgiveness when he was willing to bestow it What also weighed strongly on his mind was the consideration that the sum which his father had offered to deposit for the use of his wife would in case any finister accident should befall him afford a small provision for her and his infant  The result of these deliberations was that Mons du F  determined and who can much blame his want of prudence he determined to confide in a fatherto trust in that instinctive affection which far from being connected with any peculiar sensibility of mind it requires only to be a parent to feelan affection which not confined to the human heart softens the ferociousness of the tiger and speaks with a voice that is heard amidst the howlings of the desert  Monsdu F  after the repeated promises of his father almost considered that suspicion which still hung upon his mind as a crime But lest it might be possible that this agent was commissioned to deceive him he endeavoured to melt him into compassion for his situation He went to the village where his child was at nurse and bringing her six miles in his arms presented her to this man telling him that the fate of that poor infant rested upon his integrity The man took the innocent creature in his arms kissed her and then returning her to her father renewed all his former assurances Mons du F  listened and believed Alas how difficult is it for a good heart to suspect human nature of crimes which make one blush for the species How hard is it for a mind glowing with benevolence to believe that the bosom of another harbours the malignity of a demon  Mons du F  now fixed the time  for his departure with his father's agent who was to accompany him to Normandy Madame du F  saw the preparations for his journey with anguish which she could ill conceal but she felt that the delicacy of her situation forbad her interference It was she who had made him an alien from his family and an exile from his country it was for her that renouncing rank fortune friends and connexions all that is esteemed most valuable in life he had suffered the last extremity of want and now submitted to a state of drudgery and dependance Would he not have a right to reproach her weakness if she attempted to oppose his reconciliation with his father and exerted that influence which she possessed over his mind in order to detain him in a situation so remote from his former expectations She was therefore sensible that the duty the gratitude she owed her husband now required on her part the absolute  sacrifice of her own feelings she suffered without complaint and endeavoured to resign herself to the will of Heaven  The day before his departure Mons du F  went to take leave of his little girl At this moment a dark and melancholy presage seemed to agitate his mind He pressed the child for a long while to his bosom and bathed it with his tears The nurse eagerly inquired what was the matter and assured him that the child was perfectly well Mons du F  had no power to reply he continued clasping his infant in his arms and at length tearing himself from her in silence he rushed out of the house  When the morning of his departure came Madame du F  addressing herself to his fellowtraveller said to him with a voice of supplication  I entrust you Sir with my husband with the father of my poor infant our sole protector  and supporthave compassion on the widow and the orphan  The man casting upon her a gloomy look gave her a cold answer which made her soul shrink within her When Mons du F  got into the Brighthelmstone stage he was unable to bid her farewell but when the carriage drove off he put his head out of the window and continued looking after her while she fixed her eyes on him and might have repeated with Imogen  I would have broke mine eyestrings  Crack'd them but to look upon him till the diminution  Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle  Nay follow'd him till he had melted from  The smallness of a gnat to air and then  Then turn'd mine eye and wept  When the carriage was out of sight she summoned all her strength and walked with trembling steps to the school where she lived as a teacher With much difficulty  she reached the door but her limbs could support her no longer and she fell down senseless at the threshold She was carried into the house and restored to life and the sensations of misery  LETTER XVIII  MONS du F  arrived at his father's  château  in Normandy in June and was received by Mons le Baron and all his family with the most affectionate cordiality In much exultation of mind he dispatched a letter to Madame du F  containing this agreeable intelligence but his letter was far from producing in her mind the effect he desired A deep melancholy had seized her thoughts and her foreboding heart refused to sympathise in his joy Short indeed was its duration He had not been many days at the  château  when he perceived with surprise and consternation that his steps were continually watched by two servants armed with fusees  His father now shewed him an  arrêt    which on the th of June he had obtained from the Parliament of Rouen against his marriage The Baron then ordered his son to accompany him to his house at Rouen whither they went attended by several servants That evening when the attendants withdrew after supper the Baron entirely throwing off the mask of civility and kindness which he had worn in such opposition to his nature reproached his son in terms of the utmost bitterness for his past conduct inveighed against his marriage and after having exhausted every expression of rage and resentment at length suffered him to retire to his own apartment  There the unhappy Mons du F  absorbed in the most gloomy reflexions lamented in vain that fatal credulity which had led him to put himself into the power of his implacable father At the hour of midnight his meditations were interrupted by the sound of feet approaching  his chamber and in a few moments the door was thrown open and his father attended by a servant armed and two  Officers of justice  Cavaliers de Maréchaussée  entered the room Resistance and supplication were alike unavailing Mons du F  's papers were seized a few louis d'ors which constituted all the money he possessed were taken from him and he was conducted in the dead of night July the th to St Yon a convent used as a place of confinement near Rouen where he was thrown into a dungeon  A week after his father entered the dungeon You will perhaps conclude that his hard heart felt at length the relentings of a parent you will at least suppose that his imagination being haunted and his conscience tormented with the image of a son stretched on the floor of this subterraneous cell he could support the idea no longer and had hastened  to give repose to his own mind by releasing his captive Far different were the motives of his visit He considered that such was his son's attachment to his wife that so long as he believed he had left her in possession of seven hundred pounds he would find comfort from that consideration even in the depth of his dungeon His father therefore hastened to remove an error from the mind of his son which left the measure of his woes unfilled Nor did he choose to yield to another the office of inflicting a pang sharper than captivity but himself informed his son that the merchant who was to pay the seven hundred pounds to his wife was declared a bankrupt  A short time after the Baron du F  commenced a suit at law against that agent of iniquity whom he had employed to deceive his son and who practising a refinement of treachery of which the Baron was not aware had kept the seven  hundred pounds with which he was intrusted and given draughts upon a merchant who he knew would fail before the time of payment Not being able to prosecute this affair without a power of attorney from his son the Baron applied to him for that purpose but Mons du F  being firmly resolved not to deprive his wife of the chance of recovering the money for herself and her child could by no treaties or menaces be led to comply In vain his father who had consented to allow him a few books ordered him to be deprived of that resource and that his confinement should be rendered still more rigorous he continued inflexible  Mons du F  remained in his prison without meeting with the smallest mark of sympathy from any one of his family though his second brother Mons de B  was now eighteen years of age an age at which the sordid considerations  of interest how much soever they may affect our conduct at a more advanced period of life can seldom stifle those warm and generous feelings which seem to belong to youth It might have been expected that this young man would have abhorred the prospect of possessing a fortune which was the just inheritance of his brother and which could only be obtained by detaining that brother in perpetual captivity Even admitting that his inexorable father prohibited his visiting the prison of his brother his heart should have told him that disobedience in this instance would have been a virtue or was it not sufficient to remain a passive spectator of injustice without becoming as he afterwards did the agent of cruelty inflicted on a brother  Where are the words that can convey an adequate idea of the sufferings of Madame du F  during this period Three weeks after her husband's departure  from England she heard the general report of the town of Rouen that the Baron du F  had obtained a  lettredecachet  against his son and thrown him into prison This was all she heard of her husband for the space of two years Ignorant of the place of his confinement uncertain if he still lived perhaps her miseries were even more poignant than his In the dismal solitude of a prison his pains were alleviated by the soothing reflexion that he suffered for her he loved while that very idea was to her the most bitter aggravation of distress Her days passed in anguish which can only be conceived where it has been felt and her nights were disturbed by the gloomy wanderings of fancy Sometimes she saw him in her dreams chained to the floor of his dungeon his bosom bathed in blood and his countenance disfigured by death sometimes she saw him hastening towards her when at the moment that he was  going to embrace her they were fiercely torn asunder Madame du F  was naturally of a delicate constitution and gries of mind reduced her to such a deplorable state of weakness that it was with infinite difficulty she performed the duties of her situation For herself she would have welcomed death with thankfulness but she considered that her child now depended entirely on her labours for support and this was a motive sufficiently powerful to prompt her to the careful preservation of her own life though it had long become a burden The child was three years old when her father left England recollected him perfectly and whenever her mother went to visit her used to call with eagerness for her papa The inquiry in the voice of her child of "When shall I see my dear dear papa" was heard by this unhappy mother with a degree of agony which it were vain indeed to describe  LETTER XIX  MONS du F  was repeatedly offered his liberty but upon conditions which he abhorred He was required for ever to renounce his wife who while she remained with her child in a distant country was to receive from his father a small pension as an equivalent for the pangs of disappointed affection of disgrace and dishonour With the indignation of offended virtue he spurned at these insulting propositions and endeavoured to prepare his mind for the endurance of perpetual captivity  Nor can imagination form an idea of a scene more dreadful than his prison where he perceived with horror that the greatest number of those prisoners who had been many years in confinement had an  appearance of frenzy in their looks which shewed that reason had been too weak for the long struggle with calamity and had at last yielded to despair In a cell adjoining Mons du F  's was an old man who had been confined nearly forty years His grey beard hung down to his waist and during the day he was chained by his neck to the wall He was never allowed to leave his cell and never spoke but Mons du F  used to hear the rattling of his chains  The prisoners a few excepted were generally brought from their cells at the hour of noon and dined together But this gloomy repast was served in uninterrupted silence They were not suffered to utter one word and the penalty of transgressing this rule was a rigorous confinement of several weeks As soon as this comfortless meal was finished the prisoners were instantly obliged to return to their dungeons in which they  were locked up till the same hour the following day Mons du F  in his damp and melancholy cell passed two winters without fire and suffered so severely from cold that he was obliged to wrap himself up in the sew clothes which covered his bed Nor was he allowed any light except that which during the short day beamed through the small grated window in the cieling of his dungeon  Is it not difficult to believe that these sufferings were inflicted by a father A fatherthat name which I cannot trace without emotion which conveys all the ideas of protection of security of tenderness that dear relation to which in general children owe their profperity their enjoyments and even their virtuesAlas the unhappy Mons du F  owed nothing to  his  father but that life which from its earliest period his cruelty had embittered and  which he now condemned to languish in miseries that death only could heal  A young gentleman who was confined in a cell on one side of Mons du F  's contrived to make a small hole through the wall and these companions in misfortune by placing themselves close to the hole could converse together in whispers But the Monks were not long in discovering this and effectually deprived them of so great an indulgence by removing them to distant cells These unrelenting Monks who performed with such fidelity their office of tormenting their fellowcreatures who never relaxed in one article of persecution and adhered with scrupulous rigour to the code of cruelty were called  The Brothers of the Holy Charity  "Les Frères de la sainte Charité" One among them deserved the appellation This good old Monk used to visit the prisoners by stealth and endeavour to administer  comfort to their affliction Often he repeated to Mons du F    My dear brother be comforted place your confidence in God your afflictions will have an end  Mon cher frère consolezvous mettez votre confiance en Dieu vos maux seront finis  Mons du F  remained two years in prison without receiving any intelligence of his wife on whose account he suffered the most distracting anxiety He had reason to apprehend that her frame which had already been enfeebled by her misfortunes would sink beneath this adtional load of misery and that she would perhaps be rendered unable to procure that little pittance which might preserve herself and her child from want At length one of his fellowprisoners who was going to regain his liberty took charge of a letter to Madame du F  and flattered him with the hope of finding  some means of transmitting to him an answer  The letter paints so naturally the situation of his mind that I have translated some extracts from it  My thoughts  he says  are unceasingly occupied about you and my dear little girl I am for ever recalling the blessed moments when I had the happiness of being near you and at that recollection my tears refuse to be controuled How could I consent to separate myself from what was most dear to me in the world No motive less powerful than that of seeking your welfare and that of my child could have determined meand alas I have not accomplished this end I know too well that you have never received that sum of money which I thought I had secured for you and for which I risked the first blessing of life What fills my mind with the greatest  horror in the solitude of my prison is the fear that you are suffering difficulties in a foreign country Here I remain ignorant of your fate and can only offer to Heaven the most ardent vows for your welfare  What joy would a letter from you give me but I dare not flatter myself with the hope of such sweet consolation All I can assure myself of is that though separated perhaps for ever our souls are united by the most tender friendship and attachment Perhaps I may not find it possible to write to you again for a long while but be assured that no menaces no sufferings no dungeons shall ever shake my fidelity to you and that I shall love you to the last hour of my existence I find a consolation in the reflexion that it is for you I suffer If Providence ever permits us to meet again that moment will efface the remembrance  of all my calamities Live my dearest wife in that hope I conjure you to preserve your life for my sake and for the sake of our dear little girl Embrace her tenderly for me and desire her also to embrace you for her poor papa I need not recommend my child to the care of so tender a mother but I conjure you to inspire her mind with the deepest sense of religion If she is born to inherit the misfortunes of her father this will be her best source of consolation  Whatever offers may be made you by my father I exhort you never have the weakness to listen to them but preserve your rights and those of my dear little girl which perhaps may one day be of some value If you are still at Mrs D  's boardingschool tell her that I recommend my wife and child to her compassionBut what am I saying I am ignorant if  you are still with her ignorant whether the dearest objects of my affection still live But I trust that Providence has preserved you Adieu May God Almighty bless you and my child I never cease imploring him to have pity on the widow and the orphan in a land of strangers  LETTER XX  YOU my dear friend who have felt the tender attachments of love and friendship and the painful anxieties which absence occasions even amidst scenes of variety and pleasure who understand the value at which tidings from those we love is computed in the arithmetic of the heart who have heard with almost uncontroulable emotion the postman's rap at the door have trembling seen the wellknown hand which excited sensations that almost deprived you of power to break the seal which seemed the talisman of happiness you can judge of the feelings of Mons du F  when he received by means of the same friend who had conveyed his letter an answer from his wife But the person who  brought the letter to his dungeon dreading the risk of a discovery insisted that after having read it he should return it to him immediately Mons du F  pressed the letter to his heart bathed it with his tears and implored the indulgence of keeping it at least till the next morning He was allowed to do so and read it till every word was imprinted on his memory and after enjoying the sad luxury of holding it that night on his bosom was forced the next morning to relinquish his treasure  On the th of October the Baron du F  came to the convent and ordered the Monks to bring his son from his dungeon to the parloir and leave them together With the utmost reluctance Mons du F  obeyed this summons having long lost all hope of softening the obdurate  of his father When the Monks withdrew the Baron began upbraiding him in the most bitter  terms for his obstinate resistance to his will which he informed him had availed nothing as he had gained his suit at law and recovered the seven hundred pounds Mons du F  replied that the pain he felt from this intelligence would have been for more acute had his wife been deprived with his concurrence of the money which was promised for her subsistence and on the reliance of which promise he had been tempted to leave England His father then inquired if he still persisted in his adherence to the disgraceful connexion he had formed to which his son answered that not merely were his affections interested but that his honour obliged him to maintain with inviolable fidelity a solemn and sacred engagment The rage of the Baron at these words became unbounded he stamped the ground with his feet he aimed a stroke at his son who taking advantage of this moment of frenzy determined to  attempt his escape and rushing out of the apartment and avoiding that side of the convent which the Monks inhabited he endeavoured to find his way to the garden but missed the passage which led to it He then flew up a staircase from which he heard the voice of his father calling for assistance Finding that all the doors which he passed were shut he continued ascending till he reached the top of the building where meeting with no other opening than a hole made in the sloping roof to let in light to a garret he climbed up with much difficulty and then putting his feet through the hole and letting his body out by degrees he supported himself for a moment on the roof and deliberated on what he was about to do But his mind was at this crisis wrought up to a pitch of desperation which mocked the suggestions of fear He quitted his hold and flinging himself from a height of nearly fifty  feet became insensible before he reached the ground where he lay weltering in his blood and to all appearance dead  He had fallen on the high road leading from Rouen to Caen Some people who were passing gathered round him and one person having washed the blood from his face instantly recognized his features and exclaimed to the astonished crowd that he was the eldest son of the Baron du F  Upon examining his body it was found that he had broken his arm his thigh his anclebone and his heel besides having received many violent bruises He still remained in a state of insensibility and while these charitable strangers were using their efforts to restore him to life the Monks hastened from their convent snatched their victim from those good Samaritans who would have poured oil and wine into his wounds and carried him to the infirmary of the convent where he remained some weeks  before he recovered his senses after which he lay stretched upon a bed for three months suffering agonies of pain  His father who had been the jailor and almost the murderer of his son heard of these sufferings without remorse nor did he ever see him more But though he was sufficiently obdurate to bear unmoved the calamities he had inflicted on his child though he could check the upbraidings of his own conscience he could not silence the voice of public indignation The report that Mons du F  had been found lying on the road bathed in blood and had in that condition been dragged to the prison of St Yon was soon spread through the town of Rouen Every one sympathised in the fate of this unfortunate young man and execrated the tyranny of his unrelenting father  The universal clamour reached the ear of his brother Mons de B  who now for the first time out of respect to  the public opinion took a measure which his heart had never dictated during the long captivity of his brother that of visiting him in prison Mons de B  's design in these visits was merely to appease the public for small indeed was the consolation they afforded to his brother He did not come to bathe with his tears the bed where that unhappy young man lay stretched in pain and anguish to lament the severity of his father to offer him all the consolation of fraternal tendernesshe came to warn him against indulging a hope of ever regaining his libertyhe came to pierce his soul with  hard unkindness' alter'd eye which mocks the tear it forc'd to flow  I will not attempt to describe the wretchedness of Madame du F  when she heard the report of her husband's situation Your heart will conceive what she suffered far better than I can relate it Three months after his  fall Mons du F  contrived through the assistance of the charitable old monk to send her a few lines written with his left hand  My fall  he says  has made my captivity known and has led the whole town of Rouen to take an interest in my misfortunes Perhaps I shall have reason to bless the accident which may possibly prove the means of procuring me my liberty and uniting me again to youIn the mean time I trust that Providence will watch with paternal goodness over the two objects of my most tender affection Do not my dearest wife suffer the thoughts of my situation to prey too much upon your mind My arm is almost well my thigh and foot are not quite cured but I am getting better  I could not suppress my tears on reading that part of your letter wherein you tell me that my dear little girl often asks for her papaKiss her for me a  thousand times and tell her that her papa is always thinking of her and her dear mama I am well convinced that you will give her the best education your little pittance can afford but above all I beseech you inspire her young mind with sentiments of piety teach her to love her Creator that is the most essential of all lessons Adieu dearest and most beloved of women Is there a period in reserve when we shall meet again Oh how amply will that moment compensate for all our misfortunes  LETTER XXI  AT length the Parliament of Rouen began to interest itself in the cause of Mons du F  The circumstances of his confinement were mentioned in that Assembly and the President sent his Secretary to Mons du F  's prison who had now quitted his bed and was able to walk with the assistance of crutches By the advice of the President Mons du F  addressed some letters to the Parliament representing his situation in the most pathetic terms and imploring their interference in his behalf  It is here necessary to mention that Mons de Bel B    ProcureurGénéral de Rouen  being intimately connected with the Baron du F  's family had ventured to demonstrate his friendship for  the Baron by confining his son nearly three years on his own authority and without any  lettredecachet  And though Mons de Bel B  well knew that every species of oppression was connived at under the shelter of  lettresdecachet  he was sensible that it was only beneath their auspices that the exercise of tyranny was permitted and in this particular instance not having been cruel  According to rules  selon les règles  he apprehended that if ever Mons du F  regained his liberty he might be made responsible for his conduct He therefore exerted all his influence and with too much success to frustrate the benevolent intention of the President of the Parliament respecting Mons du F  His letters were indeed read in that Assembly and ordered to be registered where they still remain a record of the pusillanimity of those men who suffered the  authority of Mons de Bel B  to overcome the voice of humanity who acknowledged the atrocity of the Baron du F  's conduct and yet were deaf to the supplications of his son while from the depth of his dungeon he called upon them for protection and redress  May the fate of the captive in the land of France no more hang suspended on the frail thread of the pity or the caprice of individuals May Justice erect on eternal foundations her protecting sanctuary for the oppressed and may humanity and mercy be the graceful decorations of her temple  The Baron du F  perceived that notwithstanding his machinations had prevented the Parliament of Rouen from taking any effectual measures towards liberating his son it would be impossible to silence the murmurs of the public while he remained confined at St Yon He determined therefore to remove him  to some distant prison where his name and family were unknown and where beyond the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Rouen his groans might rise unpitied and unavenged But the Baron not daring amidst the general clamour to remove his son by force endeavoured to draw him artfully into the snare he had prepared  Mons de B  was sent to his brother's prison where he represented to him that though he must not indulge the least hope of ever regaining his liberty yet if he would write a letter to Mons M  Keeper of the Seals desiring to be removed to some other place his confinement should be made far less rigorous Mons du F  was now in a state of desperation that rendered him almost careless of his fate He perceived that the Parliament had renounced his cause he saw no possibility of escape from St Yon and flattered himself that in a place where he was  less closely confined it might perhaps be practicable and therefore he consented to write the letter required which Mons de B  conveyed in triumph to his father There were however some expressions in the letter which the Baron disapproved on which account he returned it desiring that those expressions might be changed But during the interval of his brother's absence Mons du F  had reflected on the rash imprudence of confiding in the promises of those by whom he had been so cruelly deceived No sooner therefore did Mons de B  put the letter again into his hands than he tore it into pieces and peremptorily refused to write another  Soon after this Mons de B  the ambassador of the tyrant again returned to his brother with fresh credentials and declared to him that if he would write to the Keeper of the Seals desiring to be removed from St Yon he should in one  fortnight after his removal be restored to liberty Upon Mons du F  's asserting that he could no longer confide in the promises made him by his family his brother in a formal written engagement to which he signed his name gave him the most solemn assurance that this promise should be fulfilled with fidelity Mons du F  desired a few days for deliberation and during that interval found means of consulting a magistrate of Rouen who was his friend and who advised him to comply with the terms that were offered after having caused several copies of the written engagement to be taken and certified by such of the prisoners at St Yon as were likely to regain their freedom a precaution necessary lest his own copy should be torn from his hands  Thus having neither trusted to the affection the mercy or the remorse of those within whose bosoms such sentiments were  extinguished having bargained by a written agreement with a father and a brother for his release from the horrors of perpetual captivity Mons du F  wrote the letter required  Soon after an order was sent from Versailles for his release from the prison of St Yon and with it a  lettredecachet  whereby he was exiled to Beauvais with a command not to leave that town Mons de B  acting as a  An officer of justice  Cavalier de la Maréchaussée  conducted his brother to this place of exile and there left him A short time after Mons du F  received an intimation from that magistrate of Rouen who had interested himself in his misfortunes that his father was on the point of obtaining another  lettredecachet  to remove him from Beauvais to some prison in the south of France where he might never more be heard of  This gentleman added that Mons du F  had not one moment to lose and advised him immediately to attempt his escape  Early on the morning after he received this intelligence Mons du F  who had the liberty to walk about the town fled from Beauvais The person who brought him the letter from the magistrate waited for him at a little distance from the town and accompanied him on his journey When they reached Lisle in Flanders not having a passport they were obliged to wait from eleven o'clock at night till ten the next morning before they could obtain permission from the Governor to proceed on their journey Mons du F  concluded that he was pursued and suffered the most dreadful apprehensions of being overtaken His companion with some address at length obtained a passport and attended him as far as Ostend The wind proving contrary  he was detained two days in a state of the most distracting inquietude and concealed himself on board the vessel on which he had taken his passage for England At length the wind became favourable the vessel sailed and arrived late in the night at Margate Mons du F  when he reached the English shore knelt down and in a transport of joy kissed the earth of that dear country which had twice proved his asylum  He then inquired when the stagecoach set off for London and was told that it went at so early an hour the next morning that he could not go till the day after as he must wait till his portmanteau was examined by the customhouse officers who were now in bed The delay of a few hours in seeing his wife and child after such an absence after such sufferings was not to be endured in a violent agitation of mind he snatched up his portmanteau and was going to fling it  into the sea when he was prevented by the people near him who said that if he would pay the fees his portmanteau should be sent after him He eagerly complied with their demands and set out for London As he drew near his anxiety his impatience his emotion increased His present situation appeared to him like one of those delicious dreams which sometimes visited the darkness of his dungeon and for a while restored him in imagination to those he loved Scarcely could he persuade himself that he was beyond the reach of oppression that he was in a land of freedom that he was hastening every moment towards his wife and child When he entered London his sensations became almost too strong to bear He was in the very same place which his wife and child inhabitedbut were they yet alive were they in health had Heaven indeed reserved for him the transport of holding them once more to  his bosom of mixing his tears with theirs When he knocked at the door of the house where he expected to hear of Madame du F  he had scarcely power to articulate his inquiries after her and his child He was told that they were in health but that Madame du F  being in a situation six miles from London he could not see her till the next morning Mons du F  had not been in a bed for several nights and was almost overcome with agitation and fatigue He however instantly set out on foot for the habitation of his wife announced himself to the mistress of the family and remained in another apartment while she after making Madame du F  promise that she would listen to her with calmness told her that there was a probability of her husband's return to England He heard the sobs the exclamations of his wife at this intelligencehe could restrain no longerhe rushed into the roomhe  flew into her armshe continued pressing her in silence to his bosom She was unable to shed a tear and it was not till after he had long endeavoured to soothe her by his tenderness and had talked to her of her child that she obtained relief from weeping She then with the most violent emotion again and again repeated the same inquiries and was a considerable time before she recovered any degree of composure  All the fortune Mons du F  possessed when he reached London was one half guinea but his wife had during his absence saved ten guineas out of her little salary You will easily imagine how valuable this hoard became in her estimation when she could apply it to the precious use of relieving the necessities of her husband Mons du F  went to London the next day and hired a little garret there with a few books a rushlight and some straw in which he wrapped his  legs to supply the want of fire he recollected not the splendour to which he had once been accustomed but the dungeon from which he had escaped He saw his wife and child once a week and in those solitary moments when books failed to soothe his thoughts he anticicaped the hour in which he should again meet the objects most dear to his heart and passed the intervals of time in philosophic resignation His clothes being too shabby to admit of his appearing in the day he issued from his little shed when it was dark and endeavoured to warm himself by the exercise of walking  Unfortunately he caught the smallpox and his disorder rose to such a height that his life was despaired of In his delirium he used to recapitulate the sad story of his misfortunes and when he saw any person near his bedside would call out with the utmost vehemence  "  Make all the French go out  Qu'on fasse sortir tous les François" After having been for some days in the most imminent danger Mons du F  recovered from this disease  LETTER XXII  SIX months after Mons du F  's return to England his family found themselves compelled to silence the public clamours by allowing him a small annual pension Upon this Madame du F  quitted her place and came to live with her husband and her child in an obscure lodging Their little income received some addition by means of teaching the French language in a few private families  A young lady who came to pay me a visit at London in desired to take some lessons in French and Madame du  F  was commended to us for that purpose We soon perceived in her conversation every mark of a cultivated mind and of an amiable disposition She at length told us the history of her misfortunes with the pathetic eloquence of her own charming language and after having heard that recital it required but common humanity to treat her with the respect due to the unhappy and to feel for her sorrows that sympathy to which they had such claim How much has the sensibility of Mons and Madame du F  overrated those proofs of esteem and friendship which we were enabled to show them in their adversityBut I must not anticipate  On the th of October the Baron died leaving besides Mons du F  two other sons and a daughter  I must here mention that at the time when Mons du F  was confined to his bed in the prison of St Yon from the  consequences of his fall his father in order to avoid the clamours at Rouen went for some weeks to Paris He there made a will disinheriting his eldest son By the old laws of France however a father could not punish his son more than once for the same offence Nor was there any thing in so mild a clause that could much encourage disobedience since this single punishment of which the mercy of the law was careful to avoid repetition might be extended to residence for life in a dungeon Such was evidently the intention of the Baron du F  and though his son disappointing this intention had escaped with only three years of captivity and some broken limbs the benignant law abovementioned interposed to prevent farther punishment and left the Baron without any legal right to deprive Mons du F  of his inheritance His brothers being sensible of this wrote to inform him of his father's  death and recall him to France He reused to go while the  lettredecachet  remained in force against him The Baron having left all his papers sealed up which his younger sons could not open but in the presence of their brother they obtained a revocation of the  lettredecachet  and sent it to Mons du F  who immediately set off for France  The Baron's estate amounted to about four thousand pounds a year Willing to avoid a tedious litigation with his brothers Mons du F  consented to divide with them this property But he soon found reason to repent of his imprudent generosity those very brothers on whom he had bestowed an equal share of his fortune refusing to concur with him in his application to the Parliament of Rouen for the revocation of the  arrêt  against his marriage Mons du F  surprised and shocked at their refusal began to entertain some apprehensions of  his personal safety and dreading that supported by the authority of his mother another  lettredecachet  might be obtained against him he hastened back to England Nor was it till after he had received assurances from several of the magistrates of Rouen that they would be responsible for the safety of his person that he again ventured to return to France accompanied by Madame and Mademoiselle du F  in order to obtain the revocation of the  arrét  On their arrival at Rouen finding that the Parliament was exiled and that the business could not be prosecuted at that time they again came back to pais the winter in England  In the following summer Mons and Madame du F  arrived in France at the great epocha of French liberty on the th of July the very day after that on which the Bastille was taken It was then that Mons du F  felt himself  in security on his native shoreIt was then that his domestic comforts were no longer embittered with the dread of being torn from his family by a separation more terrible than death itselfIt was then that he no more feared that his repose at night would be broken by the entrance of ruffians prepared to drag him to dungeons the darkness of which was never visited by the blessed beams of day  He immediately took possession of his  château  and only waits for the appointment of the new Judges to solicit the revocation of the  arrét  against his marriage and to secure the inheritance of his estate to Mademoiselle du F  his only daughter who is now fifteen years of age and is that very child who was born in the bosom of adversity and whose infancy was exposed to all the miseries of want May she never know the afflictions of her parents but may she inherit their virtues  Under the ancient government of France  there might have been some doubt of Mons du F  's obtaining the revocation of the  arrêt  against his marriage Beneath the iron hand of Despotism justice and virtue might have been overthrown But happier omens belong to the new Constitution of France The Judges will commence their high office with that dignity becoming so important a trust by cancelling an act of the most flagrant oppression They will confirm that solemn that sacred engagement which Mons and Madame du F  have three times vowed at the altar of Godwhich has been sanctioned by laws human and divinewhich has been ratified in earth and in heaven  No sooner had Mons and Madame du F  taken possession of their property than they seemed eager to convince us how little this change of fortune was capable of obliterating for one moment the remembrance of the friends of their adversity  With all the earnestness of affection they invited us to France and appeared to think their prosperity incomplete and their happiness imperfect till we accepted the invitation You will believe that we are not insensible witnesses of the delightful change in their fortune We have the joy of seeing them not only possessing all the comforts of affluence but universal respect and esteem  Mons du F  endeavours to banish misery from his possessions His tenants consider him as a father and  when the eye sees him it blesses him  I said to one of the peasants whom I met in my walk yesterday  I am happy to see that Monsieur is so much belovedOh yes Madam and well he may he does us nothing but good  "Je suis charmée de voir que Monsieur est si bien aimé ici""Oh pour ça oui Madame à bonne raison car il ne nous fait que du bien"  Such is the history of Mons du F    Has it not the air of romance and are you not glad that the  dénouement  is happyDoes not the old Baron die exactly in the right place at the very page one would chooseOr if I sometimes wish that he had lived a little longer it is only from that desire of retribution which in cases of injustice and oppression it is so natural to feelIt is only because the knowledge of the overthrow of the ancient government would have been a sufficient punishment to him for all his cruelty he would have sickened at the sight of general happiness the idea of liberty being extended to the lower ranks while at the same time tyranny was deprived of its privileges he would have found insupportable and would have abhorred a country which could no longer boast of a Bastille a country where iron cages were broken down where dungeons were thrown open and where justice was henceforth to shed a clear and steady light  without one dark shade of relief from  lettresdecachet  But peace be to his ashes If the recollection of his evil deeds excites my indignation it is far otherwise with Mons and Madame du F  Never did I hear their lips utter an expression of resentment or disrespect towards his memory and never did I with that warmth which belongs to my friendship for them involuntarily pass a censure on his conduct without being made sensible by their behaviour that I had done wrong  Adieu  LETTER XXIII  I AM glad you think that a friend's having been persecuted imprisoned maimed and almost murdered under the ancient government of France is a good excuse for loving the revolution What indeed but friendship could have led my attention from the annals of imagination to the records of politics from the poetry to the prose of human life In vain might Aristocrates have explained to me the rights of kings and Democrates have descanted on the rights of the people How many finespun threads of reasoning would my wandering thoughts have broken and how difficult should I have found it to arrange arguments and inferences in the cells of my brain But however dull the faculties of my head  I can assure you that when a proposition is addressed to my heart I have some quickness of perception I can then decide in one moment points upon which philosophers and legislators have differed in all ages nor could I be more convinced of the truth of any demonstration in Euclid than I am that that system of politics must be the best by which those I love are made happy  Mons du F  's  château  is near the little town of Forges celebrated for its mineral waters and much resorted to in summer on that account We went to the fountain on pretence of drinking the waters but in reality to see the company The first morning we made our appearance the ladies presented us with nosegays of fine spreading purple heath which they called  Nosegays of the fountain  Bouquets à la fontaine  I was told before I left England that I should find that French liberty had destroyed French urbanity but every thing I have seen and heard since my arrival in France has contradicted this assertion and led me to believe that the French will carefully preserve from the wreck of their monarchical government the old charter they have so long held of superiority in politeness I am persuaded the most determined Democrates of the nation whatever other privileges they may choose to exercise will always suffer the privilege of being rude to lie dormant  In every country it is social pleasure that sheds the most delicious flowers which grow on the path of life but in France she covers the whole way with roses and the traveller can scarcely mark its ruggedness Happy are a people so fond of talking as the French in possessing a language modelled to all the charming purposes of conv  tion Their turn of  expression is a dress that hangs so gracefully on gay ideas that you are apt to suppose that wit a quality parsimoniously distributed in other countries is in France as common as the gift of speech Perhaps that brilliant phraseology which dazzles a foreigner may be familiar and common to a French ear but how much ingenuity must we allow to a people who have formed a language of which the commonplace phrases give you the idea of wit  You who are a reader of Madame Brulart's works will know that I am here on a sort of classic ground The Abbaye de Bobec is but a few miles distant from this  château  and I walk every day in the forest where Michel and Jaqueline erected their little hot which you may remember having unfortunately built too low to admit of their standing upright they comforted themselves with the reflection  One cannot think of every thing  "Qu'on ne peut pas penser à tout" and  when they were once seated in their dwelling in which it was a vain attempt to stand expatiated on the comforts of being  At home  "chez soi" Upon inquiry I have heard that poor Jaqueline three years after the happy change in her fortune was killed by a stroke of lightning and that Michel as he was bound to do being the hero of a romance died of grief  The Abbé de Bobec has much reputation in this part of the country for wisdom but a French gentleman who dined with him yesterday told me this morning  He gave me an indigestion of good sense  "Il ma donné une indigestion de bon sens" This is something in the style of a young Frenchman who went to visit an acquaintance of his at Rotterdam and has ever since called that worthy gentleman  Reasoning continued as you would speak of a fever with fresh paroxysms  "La raison continue comme on  dit la fièvre continue avec des redoublemens"  An alarm has been spread but without any foundation that the Austrian troops were marching to invade France It puts me in mind of the old trick of the Roman patricians who whenever the plebeians grew refractory called out that the Equi and the Volsci were coming the Equi and the Volsci however never came  LETTER XXIV  WE have had a  fête  at the  château  on the day of St Augustin who is Mons du F  's patron and though Monsieur is become a Protestant I hope he will always shew this mark of respect to his old friend St Augustin Indeed I am persuaded that Luther and Calvin if they had been of our party would have reconciled their minds to these charming rites of superstition  The ceremonies began with a discharge of susees after which Mademoiselle du F  entered the saloon where a great crowd were assembled with a crown of flowers in her hand and addressed her father in those words  My deared papa can I choose a more favourable moment to wish you an agreeable  sête  than this when our best our faithful friends are here assembled and join with me in celebrating this happy day It is in the midst of your possessions my dear papa it is in your  château  that Divine Providence has reunited us to declare your virtues and the heroic fortitude with which you have supported your misfortunes The storm is past and you can now my dear papa enjoy the happiness you so well deserve and the esteem of every amiable mind May your child contribute to your felicity May the Supreme Being hear the prayers which I address to him for the preservation of a tender father to whom I offer my duty my gratitude and the best affections of my heart  Mon très cher  papa pourroisje profiter d'un moment plus favorable pour vous souhaiter une bonne fête que celui où nos bons  vrais amis  sont ici rassemblés s'unissent à moi pour célébrer cet heureux jour C'est dans vos biens cher papa c'est dans votre château que la Divine Providence nous réunit pour chanter vos vertus ce courage héroïque qui vous a fait supporter tous vos  malheurs  L'orage est passé jouissez maintenant  cher papa du bonheur que vous méritez si bien de l'estime que vous vous êtes acquis dans tous les coeurs sensibles Que votre chère ensant contribue à votre félicité que l'Eternel daigne exaucer les voeux que je lui adresse pour la conservation le bonheur d'un tendre père à qui j'ossre mes hommages ma reconnoissance les sentimens d'un coeur qui vous est tout dévoué  She then placed the crown of flowers upon his head and he embraced her tenderly A number of ladies advanced presented him with nosegays and were embraced in their turn  We had seen while we were at Paris a charming little piece performed at the Théâtre de Monsieur called "La Fédération ou La Famille Patriotique" Madame du F  sent for a copy of this piece and it was now performed by the company assembled at the  château  The tenants with their wives and daughters  formed the most considerable part of the audience and I believe no play in ancient or modern times was never acted with more applause My sister took a part in the performance which I declined doing till I recollected that one of the principal characters was a statue upon which I consented to perform  The fine part of the statue  le beau róle de la statue  And in the last scene I being the representative of Liberty appeared with all her usual attributes and guarding the consecrated banners of the nation which were placed on an altar on which was inscribed in transparent letters  To Liberty July th  "A la Liberté Juillet " One of the performers pointing to the statue says  Every nation has decorated this idol with some peculiar attributesThis cap has been long one of her most eloquent embiemsCan we not add some others which may perhaps become no less celebrated  Chaque peuple a décoré cette  idole de quelques attributs qui lui sont particuliersCe bonnet surtout est devenu un emblême éloquentNe pourrionsnous pas en ajouter d'autres qui deviendront peutétre aussi célèbres  He then unfolds a scarf of national ribband which had been placed at the foot of the altar and adds  That noble scarfare not its auspicious colours worthy of appearing amongst the attributes of Liberty  Cette noble écharpeCes couleurs si bien assorties ne sontelles pas dignes de figurer aussi parmi les attributs de la Liberté  The scarf was thrown over my shoulder and the piece concluded with  The national bells  Le Carillon National  after a grand chorus of  It will go on  ça ira  the performers ranged themselves in order and  ça ira  was danced  ça ira  hung on every lip  ça ira  glowed on every countenance Thus do the French  lest they should be tempted by pleasure to forget one moment the cause of liberty bind it to their remembrance in the hour of festivity with fillets and scarfs of national ribband connect it with the sound of the viol and the harp and appoint it not merely to regulate the great movements of government but to mould the figure of the dance When the cotillon was finished some beautiful fireworks were played off and we then went to supper  You are well placed Sir  Vous êtes bien placée Monsieur  said Madame du F  to a young Frenchman who was seated between my sister and me at table  I am made happy Madam for the first time at three and twenty years of age  Madame  answered he in a style truly French  me voilà heureux pour la première fois à vingttrois ans  After supper we returned to the saloon where the gentlemen danced with the  peasant girls and the ladies with the peasants A more joyous scene or a set of happier countenances my eyes never beheld When I recollected the former situation of my friends the spectacle before me seemed an enchanting vision I could nor forbear the whole evening comparing the past with the present and while I meant to be exceedingly merry I felt that tears which would not be suppressed were gushing from my eyesbut they were tears of luxury  LETTER XXV  A DECREE has passed in the National Assembly instituting rewards for literary merit The proposal met with great opposition from one of the MembersI do not wish to remember his name who said the State stood in need of husoandmen not poets as if the State would be encumbered by having both This gentleman thinks that provided wheat and oats flourish the culture of  mind  may be dispensed with and that if the spade and harrow are sharpened the quill of genius may be stripped of all its feathers  long live the National Assembly  Mais vive l'Assemblée Nationale  they have determined never to abolish the  nobility  of the Muses or deprive the fine arts  Of their honorary rights  de leurs droits honorifiques  Apropos of poetsThe French have conquered many old prejudices but their prejudice against Shakespeare still exists They well know that though in England it is our policy or our pleasure to have an opposition on every other subject we have not one dissenting voice about Shakspeare and therefore they allow that he may perhaps deserve to be the idol of the British nation a sort of household god whom we delight to honour but they have gods of their own to whom they pay homage and have little idea that Shakespeare was not only the glory of England but of human nature It would be a hopeless attempt to convince them that the genius of their boasted Corneille has something of the proud and affected greatness of Lewis the Fourteenth while that of Shakespeare has more affinity to the noble dignified simplicity of Henry the Fourth They repeat till you are weary of the remark that French tragedies  are egular dramas while Shakespeare's plays are monsters This reminds me of Boileau's answer to an author who had brought him a play to read of which Boileau disapproved Sir exclaimed the enraged author I defy malice to say that my piece transgresses any one of the rules  Why Sir  replied Boileau  it transgresses the first rule of all that of keeping the reader awake  The young gentleman who as I mentioned to you was confined at St Yon in the cell adjoining Mons du F  's and with whom he used to converse in whispers through a whole in the wall is come to pay a visit at the  château  This young man went very early into the army but at the age of twenty his father being at St Domingo and his mother considering her son as a spy upon her conduct which was such as shrunk from inspection obtained a  lettredecachet  against him and he was confined three  years at St Yon He has told me that after the first year he lost all hope of ever regaining his liberty A morbid melancholy seized his mind he lay stretched on the same bed for two years and sometimes refused to taste food for several days together When his father at his return from St Domingo came to liberate him he was so feeble that he was unable to walk  His father again left France and the brother of this young man has suffered a fate even more severe than himself At the age of fifteen he was guilty of some indiscretions which incurred the resentment of his unrelenting mother and another  lettredecachet  was obtained  Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts  He was confined ten years and only released when all the prisons were thrown open by order of the National Assembly But for this unhappy young man their mercy came too  lateHis reason was gone for ever and he was led out of his prison at the age of five and twenty a maniac When the sensibility with which his brother relates these family misfortunes melts us into tears we are told  Melancholy is the disease of English coalfires  que la tristesse est la maladie du charbon Anglois  and will never be tolerated in France  You will not be surprised to hear that Mons du F  has with great complacency relinquished his title and that being a  cidevant  CAPTIVE as well as a  cidevant  BARON he feels that the enjoyment of personal security the sweetness of domestic comfort in short that the common rights of man are of more value than he ever found the rights of nobility in the solitude of his dungeon He is ready to acknowledge that confinement in a subterraneous cell a fall from a height of fifty feet and the fracture of his limbs  are things which even the title of Baron can scarcely counterbalance and he therefore drinks a libation every day after dinner  To the health of the National Assembly  à la santé de l'Assemblée Nationale  though they have deprived him of the soothing epithet of Monseigneur We however shall soon cease to pledge him in this toast The day of our departure draws near We must leave the charming society at the  château  we must leave the peasants dance under the shade of the old elms while the setting sun pours streams of liquid gold through the foliagewe must leave  The player on the violin who with his miserable figure has become wrinkled from laughing  le maître de violon qui se ride en riant avec sa malheureuse figure  All this must we leaveTomorrow is the last day of our residence at the  château  What a desolate word is that monosyllable of  last  how sad how  emphatical its meaningThere is something in it which gives the most indifferent things an interest in our affectionsI am sure I could write a volume with this little word for my text but I may as well explain myself in one lineI am sorry to leave France  LETTER XXVI  London  WE left France early in September that we might avoid the equinoctial gales but were so unfortunate as to meet in our passage from Dieppe to Brighton with a very violent storm We were two days and two nights at sea and beat four and twenty hours off the coast of Brighton and it would be difficult for you who have formed your calculations of time on dry land to guess what is the length of four and twenty hours in a storm at sea At last with great difficulty we landed on the beach where we found several of our friends and acquaintance who supposing that we might be among the passengers sympathised with our danger and were anxious for our preservation  Before the storm became so serious as  to exclude every idea but that of preparing to die with composure I could not help being diverted with the comments on French customs and French politics which passed in the cabin  Ah  says one man to his companion  one had need to go to France to know how to like old England when one gets back again    For my part  rejoined another  I've never been able to get drunk once the whole time I was in Francenot a drop of porter to be hadand as for their victuals they call a bit of meat of a pound and a half a fine piece of roast beef    And pray  added he turning to one of the sailors  What do you think of their National Assembly  Why  says the sailor  if I ben't mistaken the National Assembly has got some points from the wind  I own it has surprised me not a little since I came to London to find that most of my acquaintance are of the same opinion  with the sailor Every visitor brings me intelligence from France full of dismay and horror I hear of nothing but crimes assassinations torture and death I am told that every day witnesses a conspiracy that every town is the scene of a massacre that every street is blackened with a gallows and every highway deluged with blood I hear these things and repeat to myselfIs this the picture of France Are these the images of that universal joy which called tears into my eyes and made my heart throb with sympathyTo me the land which these mighty magicians have suddenly covered with darkness where waving their evil wand they have reared the dismal scaffold have clotted the knife of the assassin with gore have called forth the shriek of despair and the agony of tortureto me this land of desolation appeared dressed in additional beauty beneath the genial smile of Liberty The woods seemed to cast a  more refreshing shade and the lawns to wear a brighter verdure while the carols of freedom burst from the cottage of the peasant and the voice of joy resounded on the hill and in the valley  Must I be told that my mind is perverted that I am become dead to all sensations of sympathy because I do not weep with those who have lost a part of their superfluities rather than rejoice that the oppressed are protected that the wronged are redressed that the captive is set at liberty and that the poor have bread Did the Universal Parent of the human race implant the feelings of pity in the heart that they should be confined to the artificial wants of vanity the ideal deprivations of greatness that they should be fixed beneath the dome of the palace or locked within the gate of the  château  without extending one commiserating sigh to the wretched hamlet as if its famished inhabitants though not ennobled by  man  did  not bear at least the ensigns of nobility stamped on our nature by God  Must I hear the charming societies in which I found all the elegant graces of the most polished manners all the amiable urbanity of liberal and cultivated minds compared with the most rude ferocious and barbarous levellers that ever existed Really some of my English acquaintance whatever objections they may have to republican principles do in their discussions of French politics adopt a most free and republican style of censure Nothing can be more democratical than their mode of expression or display a more levelling spirit than their unqualified contempt of  all  the leaders of the revolution  It is not my intention to shiver lances in every society I enter in the cause of the National Assembly Yet I cannot help remarking that since the Assembly does not presume to set itself up as an example  this country we seem to have very little right to be furiously angry because they think proper to try another system of government themselves Why should they not be suffered to make an experiment in politics I have always been told that the improvement of every science depends upon experiment But I now hear that instead of their new attempt to form the great machine of society upon a simple principle of general amity upon the FEDERATION of its members they ought to have repaired the feudal wheels and springs by which their ancestors directed its movements Yet if mankind had always observed this retrograde motion it would surely have led them to few acquisitions in virtue or in knowledge and we might even have been worshipping the idols of paganism at this moment To forbid under the pains and penalties of reproach all attempts of the human mind to advance to  greater perfection seems to be proscribing every art and science and we cannot much wonder that the French having received so small a legacy of public happiness from their forefathers and being sensible of the poverty of their own patrimony should try new methods of transmitting a richer inheritance to their posterity  Perhaps the improvements which mankind may be capable of making in the art of politics may have some resemblance to those they have made in the art of navigation Perhaps our political plans may hitherto have been somewhat like those illconstructed misshapen vessels which unfit to combat with the winds and waves were only used by the ancients to convey the warriors of one country to despoil and ravage another neighbouring state which only served to produce an intercourse of hostility a communication of injury an exchange of rapine  and devastationBut it may possibly be within the compass of human ability to form a system of politics which like a modern ship of discovery built upon principles that defy the opposition of the tempestuous elements "and passions are the elements of life" instead of yielding to their fury makes them subservient to its purpose and sailing sublimely over the untracked ocean unites those together whom nature seemed for ever to have separated and throws a line of connexion across the divided world  One cause of the general dislike in which the French revolution is held in this country is the exaggerated stories which are carefully circulated by such of the aristocrates as have taken refuge in England They are not all however persons of this description There is now a young gentleman in London nephew to the Bishop de Sens who has lost his fortune his rank  all his high expectations and yet who has the generosity to applaud the revolution and the magnanimity to reconcile himself to personal calamities from the consideration of general good and who is "faithful found" to his country "among the faithless" I hope this amiable young Frenchman will live to witness and to share the honours the prosperity of that regenerated country and I also hope that the National Assembly of France will answer the objections of its adversaries in the manner most becoming its own dignity by forming such a constitution as will render the French nation virtuous flourishing and happy  FINIS  LATELY PUBLISHED By the same AUTHOR  POEMS in Two Volumes Price s sewed  JULIA a Novel interspersed with some Poetical PiecesTwo
