are the Production of my leisure Hours they are imperfect to a Degree too full of Expletives and Incongruity nothing cou'd have induc'd me to have publish'd them now but my having promis'd them my Friends these two Years and rather than they should accuse me of being worse than my Word I have ventur'd to expose myself to the Censure of the World and the Judgment of the Reviewers but as they are my first Productions I could wish to be overlook'd on the Promise they shall be my last when I wrote them indeed I had the Vanity like all  young Authors to think I was smitten with the Muses but now to my Grief I too clearly see that I have smitten them with a Stab of Disgrace having disturb'd and made muddy the peerless Stream of  Helicon  My Pretensions to Letters must appear the highest Presumption from many Reasons first from my humble and obscure Situation and secondly from my being depriv'd of a Classical Education c for great Scholars like great Rogues can take such Liberties as little ones dare not think ofI have only this one Consolation that as my Reputation as an Author is but little I have the less to looseI don't doubt but this will be an unwelcome Offering but I have presum'd to inscribe it to you because I know you bear me that Friendship that were you sure to derogate by such a Reception you would take it as it was meant the only Acknowledgment I had left in Return for the many Favours I have receiv'd and the good Endeavours you have made to serve me tho' they unfortunately prov'd ineffectual Dependance on Theatres are as fatal and as transitory as at Court and the  Promises of a Manager are as baseless as those of a Statesman so fond are all Degrees of apeing their Betters this I have a Right to speak being prompted both by Fact and Experience I cannot say indeed I had ever any great Dependance at Court But to my Sorrow I know it and at this Moment feel the fatal Consequence of depending on Theatres and the alluring Promises bound with the sacred Ties of Honour and Friendship of Managers had I not been told by my Friends and these too in my Opinion the best Judges of the age such as Mr  Churchill  Mr  Lloyd  Mrs  Cibber  and yourself that I was possess'd of some Requisites for the Stage I had never attempted it prompted by this and conscious of the Right I as an Individual had to an Attempt and strenghten'd by the Obligations that the Theatres when in a drooping State were once under to my Father for his many excellent and receiv'd Entertainments I was flatter'd into Hope and Expectation giving up all my other Connections in Life and sacrificing all other Interests to the seeming Friendship and solemn Promises of Mr  L  who like a Sorcerer led me into a Labyrinth of Delusion and left me to bewail my Situation in Oblivion Could I but recall the whole two Years Expence the Loss of Time and prevent the inevitable Destruction of a dear and tender Family I would forgive the heavy Load of Anxiety the daily Expectations and the hourly Disappointments that I met with their Frowns of Authority their Shafts of Impunity their Stare of Despotism and their Sneers of Contumely all these I could forget but that my Wounds still bleed and Pain begets Remembrance  I am  dear Sir  with the greatest respect and sincerity Your very humble Servant GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY  THE INOCULATOR A COMEDY IN THREE ACTS  Dramatis Personae  PITTEM an Inoculating Doctor  BLANDFORD a young Gentleman in Love with Miss DANBURY  HIERAPICRA PITTEM's Apothecary  PESTLE his Servant  JERRY Servant to BLANDFORD's Uncle  KNABBEM a Bailiff  Mrs BUZBY Mr BLANDFORD in Disguise  THE INOCULATOR  ACT I  SCENE I  Pittem's  Parlour  Pittem  Solus    _WHAT a Pleasure there is in getting Money cou'd we but forget we were to die it would be the Zenith of Felicity  Enter  Pestle  Pestle  Sir Mr  Blandford  is below and desires to speak with you  Pitt  Odds so I am very busy too just now Tell him to call again byandbyno no  Pestle Pestle  tell him to walk up do you hear  Pestle  I will Sir  Exit  Pestle  Pitt  What the plague does he want here again so soon It was but Yesterday that he was plaguing me to Death about Miss  Danbury  and if I thought he had been come again on the same Errand I would have sent him Word I was sick But here he comes  Enter  Blandford  Bland  Good Morning to you Doctor  Pitt  Mr  Blandford  your very humble Servant how do you this dull Morning I'Gad I was threatening to go to Bed again  Bland  To Bed Doctor What before you are well up Or have your medical Studies kept you from sleeping all Night  Pitt  Nobut I have got a nasty something hanging on my Spirits  Bland  You're safe enough you know a Dog and a Doctor know how to choose their Physic  Pitt  An excellent Compliment    Aside    As your Kind of Gentry know how to choose the best Whres  Bland  I beg your Pardon Doctor there is no best in the Case the best of the bad is not worth choosing but if you have no more Skill in Medicines than I have in Filles de Joye I would not give a Fig for your Practice Talking of the Fair puts me in Mind of poor Miss  Danbury  never was so good a Heart so much depress'd With blooming Beauty and a Soul angelic she drags a Life of Woe and keeps the Shield of Virtue on her Arm while her Hand rejects with Scorn the tempting Bribes of gay Debauchery  Pitt  What then you young Rogue you've try'd her I suppose But she knew you had nothing to give her but Promises and so thought in that Case she might as well put on the Prude as not  Bland  Let me tell you Doctor that's a damn'd illnatured Surmise and did I not think you spoke it more out of Raillery than Sincerity I should for ever hold the most contemptible Opinion of you as a Man  Pitt  Why you did not think I was in Earnest did you  Ned    Bland  NoIf I had  Pitt  You'd have been for running me through the Body I suppose but I assure you the World says strange Things of the Girl  Bland  Aye it is a strange World Doctor  Pitt  Nay but from the many pitiful Tricks that I have detected her in myself I am determined to have nothing to do with her  Bland  You would have had it is well known if she would have let you  Pitt  There's for you now that's like her I did imagine indeed when I ceas'd to support the ungrateful Hussy in her flaunting Expectations she would raise some scandalous Report or other to hurt me in my Character and Business Oh the Jade had it not been for the great Regard I had for the Father she should have shifted for herself long ago  Bland  Your Regard for her Father  Pitt  Aye my Regard for her Father  Bland  Why what great Regard could you have for him when I have often heard you say he died five hundred Pounds in your Debt  Pitt  Why tho' he was an unfortunate Man he was an honest one as far as his Circumstances would go  Bland  That's one of the most grateful Confessions I ever heard you make of any Man before  Pitt  I had ever the most favourable Opinion of every Man and was always more inclined to hide than expose their Misfortunes  Bland  That's well again so shall your own Words convict you  Pitt  As how  Bland  Why if you were inclined to think the most favourably of Man you must in Reason think the same of Woman Kind  Pitt  And so I do  Bland  Good again and what has poor Miss  Danbury  done that every Thought of her is bad and your best Opinion but a sordid one  Pitt  Aye but Facts my dear  Ned  are Facts and the general and perpetual Complaints of the World are Circumstances too glaring to be overlook'd  Bland  What the World says in those Cases ought never to be regarded for such Reports generally arise from the inventive Gossips of a Tea table and there is a Species of Barbarity that reigns predominant in the Breasts of the lowminded Vulgar Whenever they perceive an Object of Merit that was once their Envy under the least Misfortune they are never so happy as when doing that Person  some secret Injury or till by some malignant Conspiracy they have reduced them to a State of Adversity  Pitt  And can you say that this is her Case  Bland  Yes truly for it is well known that Miss  Danbury  was scarce three Years ago the Admiration and Envy of the Country for ten Miles round and now the veriest Drab that was wont to think herself honoured with a Court'sy from her will with a provoking Sneer tell her to shorten her Furbelows and since they have found her whole Dependence is on you they have injured her by imposing on you some malicious Falsehood on the mere Supposition of which I find you are determined to compleat her Misery  Pitt  Nay Mr  Blandford  it is not for that entirely but from the very great Expence she has been to me of late and as I find that hurts my Circumstances considerably it is a Duty I owe myself not to let her ruin me entirely I have made her many good Offers nay I made Interest for her to a Gentleman and Lady who were going to  South Carolina  where they told her she would have the greatest Opportunity in the World of making her Fortune all which she ungratefully rejected and as I am under no Manner of Obligation to her or hers I think I have done for her already what hundreds would not have done in Truth therefore she must now shift for herself as well as she can  Bland  Poor Girl I can't blame her 'tis strange so great a Tenderness Mr  Danbury  had for her when living that he did not make some Provision for her at his Death  Pitt  That's the Astonishment of every one but what could a Man do that had it not in his Power  Bland  That is still more strange for every Body thought him a Man of Property  Pitt  Ah  Ned  you see with what Art some People can support a false Reputatian and when their Affairs come once to be laid open to Inspection many a worthy Family that has trusted their All in their Hands from too good an Opinion of their Circumstances find too often a broken Back in the Consequence  Bland  Well I wish the dear Creature was better provided for or that I had it in my Power to make her the happiest Woman in the Universe  Pitt  How wou'd you do that  Bland  Why I wou'd endeavour to do it by marrying her and setting her above the Frowns of the World  Pitt  And a promising Dame you wou'd get for your PainsAh  Ned  I pity you I must confessBut Plague on it if you are so wonderfully smitten with the Wench why don't you marry her  Bland  Because I am not at present possess'd of those Requisites that would be essential to our Happiness  Pitt  That is a little Money I suppose  Bland  You suppose right wou'd the kind Powers be pleas'd to take that dear pious mercenary Uncle to themselves I should be glad to fill up his Vacancy here below without any further Consideration  Pitt  Aye my dear Boy but your Uncle takes a deal of Care of his Constitution and is as likely to live thirty Years longer as yourself you shou'd have taken better Care of the last five Hundred  Ned    Bland  Why I confess if I had been as penurious as you I probably might have increas'd it to a Thousand by this Time and neither have done myself nor any body else any Good with it  Pitt  If you had it now I don't think you wou'd do yourself much Good with it by marrying Miss  Danbury    Bland  You are determined I find to do her no Good either by Word or Deed and therefore Doctor I beg you wou'd not give me any more of your cool Opinions since you cannot give her a good Word you shall not dare to give her a bad one in my Company without the warmest Resentment  Pitt  Well well mighty well then there let it drop there let it drop in the Name of Goodness may not one talk of Matrimony without having one's brains beat out Zounds I wishI could meet with a good wife with all my Heart  Bland  And a special good Husband you'd make if you thought you cou'd  kill  her with  kindness  If I thought you serious now I would help you to a good one but what will you give me for my trouble  Pitt  Give youWhat do you call a good one tho'  Bland  The Lady is not very handsome to be sure nor yet very young but she is worth a confounded deal of  Money I assure you and such a Woman can have nothing bad about her I am persuaded at least in your Eyes  Pitt  She cannot be bad that is certain if she is rich for Money was never bestow'd on any but those that were good and knew how to keep it when they had got it But how rich do you think the Lady may be  Bland  Why I have heard my Uncle say that she is worth Ten Thousand Pounds at least but don't take the least notice of it to him for he wants to get her himself only she thinks him rather too old Now such a middleag'd Man as you wou'd be the very Thing Besides she was asking me who was our best Inoculator in this Neighbourhood I told her I knew a very infallible one meaning you and she has been teazing me about you ever since  Pitt  Odds so but that is one of the most lucky Circumstances that cou'd have happen'd in my Favour Where does the Lady live and I'll pay her a visit tomorrow  Bland  Oh no not for the World she has boarded some Time in a private Family in this Neighbourhood but as the major Part of them have not had the Smallpox it is to be kept a profound Secret  Enter  Pestle  Pestle  Sir there is a Gentleman below desires to speak with you  Pitt  Tell the Gentleman I'll wait on him immediately    Exit  Pestle  I'faith  Ned  if you can bring this matter to bear I'll make you a Present the greatest Gentleman in the Land wou'd not refuse  Exit  Pitt  Bland  And that is a Pill or a Dose of Physic to take when I am sick to make me the more so for I know he has neither the Spirit or Resolution to do any thing like a Man the yellow Mammon has caught his Soul and Avarice holds his Purse Strings I don't know what the Hopes of getting this pretended Wife may dobut if he shou'd put me to the Proof I don't know where I shou'd find one that would chuse to throw herself away upon him I must do something to deceive him hey let me see Egad I think I cou'd do very well for an Old Maid myself An excellent thought but what shall I do for a Dress a Plague on't I have Interest enough among the fair Sex to get such a Thing as that to be sure The Old Maid and her Money is the Thing yet Bait for Gudgeons with  Worms and a Miser with Gold and you are sure to catch 'em I'll e'en go after the Doctor and tell him I am going to the Lady directly  Exit  Bland  SCENE II  Enter  Pittem  Pitt  So  Ned  is gone after the Lady Ten Thousand Pounds a charming Sumnay a Fortune a very good Fortune of itselflet me see Ten Thousand Pounds and Five Thousand of my own makes just Fifteen Thousand Pounds that will certainly enable me to keep a Chariot of my own the Thing I have been striving for these fourteen Years for what is a Doctor without a Chariot the Appearance of a Chariot is the Sign of good Practice and it is a common Remark when the World thinks you have much you shall have more and when but little you shall have less    a Knock at the Door    Pray walk in  Enter  Hierapicra  O is it you Mr  Hierapicra  what News what News any more Patients  Hi  We have just now lost one Sir  Pitt  Lost one how do you mean  Hi  Dead Sir  Pitt  Dead  Hi  I assure you Sir it it true  Pitt  O he must certainly have had the Itch or the King's Evil What Noise is that    a disturbance without    Hi  Pestle  and  Jerry  I fancy Sir I left them in a high Dispute  Pitt  Pestle  and  Jerry    Hi  Yes Sir  Pitt  I wish you wou'd send  Jerry  to me I want to speak to him  Hi  I will Sir  Exit  Hi  Pitt  The Deuce take me but I have walk'd upon Thorns and laid upon Nettlebeds ever since I first heard of this Fortune and I am terribly afraid that Old sly Uncle of  Ned  's will snap her up before me  Enter  Jerry  Jerry  Did you want any Thing with me Sir  Pitt  Yes my little  Jerry  your Master is not at home I suppose  Jerry  He was not when I came out  Pitt  Pray  Jerry  I hope it is no secret have not you a maiden Lady of about forty that often pays your old Master a Visit  Jerry  We have Sir  Pitt  Know you where she lives  Jerry  A few Miles off  Pitt  You do not know the Name of the Place then do you  Jerry  Why yes I do  Pitt  Cou'd not you inform me then  Jerry  I should not choose to do such a Thing without my Master's Authority  Pitt  Nopray what could be the Consequence  Jerry  A very bad one Sir for aught I know as she is a kind of a Sweetheart of my old Master's and is worth a Deal of Money I don't know if you shou'd find out where the Lady lives but you may endeavour to rival him the Consequence wou'd then be very bad on my Side I believe  Pitt  Why he should never know who told me  Jerry  That he wou'd  Pitt  'Twill be impossible manhe never shall from me  Jerry  But in the Course of his Examination it wou'd come to my Turn and then I must confess or tell him a Lie which I will not do for you or any Body else and therefore Sir to avoid any Apprehensions of that Kind it will be the best Way to say nothing at all about it  Pitt  A stubborn son of a Gun    Aside    You seem to have a great Regard for your Word  Jerry  and I applaud you for itthough I should be glad to know one Thing however which can't be of much Consequence to you or Danger to any Bodyand that is whether the Lady keeps much Company or no  Jerry  Very little I believe  Pitt  Humahshe has a pretty good Stomach I suppose  Jerry  Sir  Pitt  A good Stomach I say  Jerry  A very moderate one and as worthy a Lady as ever was bornWhat a miserable Wretch    Aside    Pitt  Is she indeed she often gives you Money then I suppose  Jerry  Sometimes Sirwhat a scurvy Scoundrel    aside    Pitt  Ha  Enter  Pestle  Pestle  Sir Mr  Blandford  desires to speak with you  Exit  Pestle  Pitt  Odds so I'm glad of thatwell  Jerry  your Servant I am glad to see you  Jerry  Sir your Servant I am glad my young Master is come to release me for I have been tir'd of my Company some Time I hope he will play his Part well and work the physical Jesuit out of a few Hundreds    Aside    Exit  Jerry  Pitt  Oh here comes  Ned    Enter  Blandford  Pitt  Welcome welcome my dear Boy welcome what News what News  Bland  What News Doctor why such News I believe as will make you compleatly happy  Pitt  Then you have seen the Lady  Bland  Yes that I have and to some Purpose why she will call upon you Tomorrow herself Man  Pitt  Happy News indeed  Bland  But the Merrythought take me now I think on't if I did not forget to tell her your Name and where you liv'd  Pitt  O lackaday lackaday now was there ever any Thing so provoking in this World  Bland  Nay upon second Consideration though I'm glad on't  Pitt  How so how so pray that is strange indeed  Bland  Why because I look upon it that were she to visit you the Business would be half done  Pitt  So much the better so much the better Man  Bland  And pray what am I to have for my Trouble  Pitt  Plague on't have not I told you I would make you a handsome Present  Bland  Yes But what Surety have I for that but your own bare Word which I would not take for a Shilling where Money is concern'd I must have your Note Doctor I must have your Note  Pitt  And so you shall I will give you a Note of five Pounds on Demand from the very Moment she consents to marry me  Bland  A Note of five Pounds scandalous and pitiful Wretch Devil why thou art a very Skinflintfive Pounds for ten Thousand' Oh horrible horrible the very Summit of MeannessA Gentleman who knew what Influence I had over the Lady but this very Day offered me two hundred Pounds only to be introduced to herFive Pounds for ten Thousand Doctor your Servant  Exit  Blandford  Pitt  Nay but Mr  Blandford  hear me hear me    hollowing after Blandford    Was there ever such a hotheaded Rascal 'Sdeath if I should lose her now He talks of an Offer of two hundred Pounds A great Sum A very great Sum But ten ThousandI must outbid the Gentleman I believe for if I should read of Miss  Suchaone  a maiden Lady of ten thousand Pounds being married to oh I shall go distracted the very Thought of losing such a Prize is worse than being the next to the l Lottery TicketBut he is goneWhere's  Pestle    rings the Bell and calls    Pestle Pestle  From Fears and Apprehensions I cannot keep a Bone of me still  Pestle  I say the Devil pound the Fellow he can't hear  Pestle    Pest    without    Who calls  Pitt  Pestle  Pest    entering

Devil you hammerheaded Rascal and I'll go myself  Exit  Pittem  Pest  Poor Master is in a Passion I doubt and talks of going to the Devil but mortar me if I follow him  Exit  Pestle  The End of the first ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Blandford  Solus  I'M glad my fair one approves of my intended Stratagem however but her Father's Letter astonishes me it is strange she never shew'd it me before he informs her but three Hours before his Death that he had provided for her very handsomely instead of that we find her destitute and forlorn and by what I understand  Pittem  was the only person that attended him in his latest Hours 'Sdeath there must have been foul Play  Pittem  is either an errant Knave or her Father must have deceived her but when I compare the two Characters the first Surmise carries with it many glaring Circumstances and the latter seems improbable I will not rest till I am satisfied  Enter  Pestle  with a Letter    Pestle  Sir my Master desired I would give this Letter into your own Hands  Bland  Very wellis he at home  Pestle  Yes Sir  Ex  Pestle  Blandford reads  Dear  Ned    I Have considered of your Proposal and shall be glad to see you on that Business directly I shall object to nothing that may prove to your Advantage  Your humble Servant  Tobias Pittem    Ho ho have I touch'd you my little SkinflintThis is an excellent Stratagem I find but there must be no Time lost in this Affair 'tis the best Time to catch a Fox when he is hungry and so I'll be with you my litle Doctor in a Crack  Ex  Blandford  SCENE II  Enter  Pittem  and  Pestle  Pitt  So  Pestle  you saw Mr  Blandford    Pest  Yes Sir  Pitt  And what did he say to you  Pest  Mortar me Sir if I heard him say any Thing at all I saw him open his Mouth and nod his Head as much as to say it was very well  Pitt  But did not he seem pleas'd  Pest  I did not stay to see Sir 'cause I thought it would be ill Manners  Pitt  Poh Pox you Blockhead you  Pest  What do you say Sir has he got the Small Pox poor Soul he had better have been inoculated  A Knock at the Door  Pitt  Go and see who is at the Door make haste    Exit Pestle    What a blunderheaded Puppy 'tishis Deafness is of little Inconveniency to me howeverfor as Secrets are generally whisper'd there is but little Danger of his hearing any and less of his telling 'em and this Country is the very Mart for Scandal  Reenter  Pestle  Pest  Sir Mr  Blandford  desires to speak with you  Pitt  Tell him to walk up  Exit  Pestle    Plague on it what a flutter I'm in were I going to receive a Challenge I could not be worse But here he comes  Enter  Plandford    Mr  Blandford  I'm sorry I made  Bland  Pray Doctor make no Ceremony there is no Occasion for it  Pitt  I'm glad on't I was afraid I should have found you as I left you full of Gunpowder  Bland  No no Doctor your Letter stopt all Fear of Explosion  Pitt  To tell you the Truth I was under great Apprehensions of your accepting of the Gentleman's Proposal that you told me of  Bland  No Doctor though I received a letter from the Gentleman since I saw you last importuning me in the most pressing Manner to introduce him yet from the Regard I bear you I was determined to give you the Preference and intended to have waited a Day or two till you had better consider'd the Matter  Pitt  That was acting the Friend indeed but to the Purpose my dear Boy you read my Letter I presume  Bland  I did  Pitt  And have you any Objection to a couple of Hundreds  Bland  Not the least  Pitt  Then I think I have nothing to fear no Doubt of Success  Bland  None in the World  Pitt  Flea me but I shall think every Hour an Age till I see her  Bland  So I suppose  Pitt  Had I not better go give her an Invitation myself as I am an utter Stranger to the Lady she'll undoubtedly expect that Compliment  Bland  I beg you would not think of such a Thing but bless your Stars that she has consented to visit you for as I have been acquainted with her from my Infancy I think myself a tolerable Judge of her Disposition  Pitt  Well I shall be advised by you  Bland  If you hope to succeed I beg you would one material Thing I should advise you to that is not to make above twelve Hours Courtship on't for I have often heard her say she could never bear to be courted above a Day And this Resolution she has taken I am informed from being crost in her first Love  Pitt  That is an excellent Notion I assure herfor I should hate one of your plaguy long Courtships myself to have an hundred Fallingsout and Fallingsin in a Week flying like Cats at oneanother Today and breaking  Heart to make it up again Tomorrow 'Sdeath I long to see her  Bland  I'll cure you of your Longing Tomorrow  Pitt  Tomorrow  Bland  Aye Tomorrow  Pitt  O brave it will be necessary to know what Time Tomorrow that I may be the better prepar'd for her Reception  Bland  About Six I fancy  Pitt  What in the Morning  Bland  No hardly Doctor ha ha ha surely you'll be able to survive your Impatience till the Afternoon  Pitt  You'll come with her then won't you  Bland  Not I indeed you'll court best by yourselves Well Doctor your Servant I've got a little Business to do for my Uncle and must be gone I shall hardly see you again till you have seen the Lady  Blandford  going    Pitt  Bye bye well Success attend thee  Bland    returning    But Doctor Doctor there is one material Matter to settle before I gothe Note Doctor the Note  Pitt  O lack a day right very right as you sayI was in Hopes he had forgot that  Aside  Bland  And another Thing I have to hint to you which will prove more to your Advantage than mine  Pitt  I'm all Attention  Bland  You must know I owe the Sum of £ to Mrs  Buzby    Pitt  Buzby  Bland  That is the Lady's Namenow I shall give the Note to her and pay off my Debt and if she should desire you to make it into Money Tomorrow to shew her what a Principle you bear you may pay it her which will be only paying to receive again you know Doctor  Pitt  With all my Heart follow me into the next Room and I'll give you the Note directly  Exeunt  Pittem  and  Blandford  SCENE III  Enter  Jerry  with a Portmanteau    Jer  Lie thou there    throwing the

you wou'd not begin to apologize the Honour you do my poor House is a Pleasure unspeakable Pleasure Madam  Mrs  Buz  O Sir I beg you wou'd not make me asham'd of myself  Pitt  O confound it what have I said now    Aside    so that I do not make you asham'd of me I shall be happy    Tumbles backwards over a Chair in making his Obedience with an extroadinary Air Mrs  Buzby  cries out    Pitt  I have made her asham'd of me now and to some Purpose    Aside and getting up    Mrs  Buz  I hope Sir you have not hurt yourself  Pitt  Not in the least Madam not in the least I hope you will excuse my putting you in a Fright  Mrs  Buz  O my dear Sir accidents are unavoidable Perhaps you are in Love Sir if so it may be easily accounted for that Rogue  Cupid  generally leads his People blindfold for we often read of a Gentleman or a Lady's falling into a River or from the meer Imagination they are loosing their Loves tumbling out of a two Pair of Stairs Window  Pitt  I do assure you Madam if I am in love 'tis with no one but yourself  Mrs  Buz  With me Sir in love with me I am confident Sir there is nothing about me so attracting that can kindle the least Affection at least from so short an Interview  Pitt  Ha Diffidence Diffidence Madam often makes Merit look too coolly on itself  Mrs  Buz  Why true Sir true 'tis very certain where  is real Ability Diffidence is sure to oppress it and J  gment is often referr'd to the vain and talkative Coxc  b while it sets doubtful and timorous in the Breast of  ModestyBut don't think Sir I meant to pay myself a Compliment by such an Observation  Pitt  I do not imagine you did Madam but give me Leave to say it is a very sensible a nay a very excellent Observation indeed MadamWhat a charming Tongue she has if I should loose her now I shall wish I'd never seen her  Aside  Mrs  Buz  But Love Sir was not the Business I came here upon it was of another Nature my Business was of another Nature quite  Pitt  No to be sure Madam I had not the Vanity to imagine it was Love Pray Madam what might it be  Mrs  Buz  Inoculation SirI have been under the greatest Apprehensions of catching the Smallpox for this Month past it being almost so generally spread about the Country and as my Cousin  Ned  has persuaded me that you have discovered a most infallible Method of eradicating that malignant Disorder I have made bold to visit you on that Business  Pitt  Madam I am infinitely oblig'd to Mr  Blandford  for his kind and generous Recommendation and more so to you Madam for imbibing so good an Opinion of me But I cou'd wish pardon me Madam I cou'd wish you wou'd consent to evade the Subject of Inoculation a few Minutes and dwell a little longer on that more excellent Topic Love  Mrs  Buz  Sir if you can convince me that the Danger of the one is not more imminent to me than the other is to you I shall very readily comply with your Request  Pitt  Then Madam I fancy I shall prevail with you  Mrs  Buz  Pray explain youself Sir  Pitt  Does your Apprehensions of the Smallpox give you at present any real Pain  Mrs  Buz  I can't say it does Sir  Pitt  But mine of Love Madam really does  Mrs  Buz  How can that be Sir even supposing me the Object of your Affections since both Passions proceed from Fear yours of losing what you never had and there it ends Mine of catching that I wou'd not wish to have which may possibly end in Death But however Sir since you are so very desirous of continuing the Theme of  Love I'll e'en set aside my Apprehensions a few Minutes and listen to youI fancy it will be best to get that Part over first least I should be discovered before I nail him for the two hundred  Aside  Pitt  Such a Condescension Madam bespeaks you every Thing that's amiable  Mrs  Buz  Sir if I thought I was really so in your Eyes I would endeavour to return the Compliment in the best Manner I cou'd  Pitt  If there was any other Way in the World more expressive than simple Words I wish I knew it that I might convince you Madam I really think younay you really are the most amiable Lady I ever met with in my Life and the only Woman I ever yet wish'd my Wife  Mrs  Buz  Sir  Pitt  Pardon me Madam if my Passion hath made my Tongue o'errun the Bounds of Decency if I have offended you Madam I beg your Pardonbut hope you will forgive me  Mrs  Buz  I believe the Doctor is in Love with me indeed    Aside    Sir I forgive you with all my Heart but can't help thinking it the strangest Thing in the World that so slight an Acquaintance shou'd breed so strong an Affection  Pitt  O Madam the very illustrious Character Mr  Blandford  has often given you to me made me almost in Love with you before you came but since I have seen you I am in Love indeed to find you so far exceed the best of Characters  Mrs  Buz  Sir I am infinitely obliged to my Cousin  Ned  but must confess he has always been very liberal in his Commendations of you  Pitt  I am equally obliged to Mr  Blandford  Madam but am afraid you have found that he has said more in my Behalf than you find true  Mrs  Buz  Sir I must confess I don't find that he hath deceived me in the least  Pitt  Madam you make me very happy indeed  Mrs  Buz  I'm glad on't Sir and should be very glad if it were in my Power to make you always so  Pitt  That it is in your Power Madam there is nothing so sure  Mrs  Buz  Then Sir you may depend upon it I will do my utmost  Pitt  But suppose Madam nothing would make me so but your own Person and Liberty  Mrs  Buz  Sir I should have no Objection of resigning them both were I sure they would make you happy  Pitt  I would venture my Happiness nay my Life Madam on such a Resignation if you would venture to give me your Hand on this fair Promise I shall be compleatly happy  Mrs  Buz  Then here it is with all my Heart for to tell you the Truth Sir I have long been tired of the Appellation of old Maid and most terribly afraid of dying one  Pitt    Takes her Hand and kisses it with great Eagerness    And I do assure you Madam the musty and fulsome Name of old Bachelor has been no less hateful to me nor do I care how soon I get rid of it  Mrs  Buz  Though I can't help thinking but I have made too brief a Capitulation Forwardness in Women generally gives Disgust But to be plain you must know Sir I hate to be courted the Heyday of Youth is over in me about sixteen or seventeen Years I us'd to take a Pleasure in denying on purpose to obtain a Number of new and useless Solicitations 'till at last I teaz'd my Lovers out of Patience  Pitt  Well I declare to you Madam I have been served so twenty times for I never payed my Addresses to a young Lady in my Life but before I could settle my Affections she tired my Patience with a feign'd Coyness giving me the greatest Encouragement Today and Tomorrow wou'd hardly look at me 'till I had dangled from Morning to Night after her and all the Excuse she had for it wasI should not think her too forward but I soon let her see I could be as capricious as herself and so broke her Acquaintaintance with a cool billetdoux and farewell  Mrs  Buz  I can't help thinking this Visit was an arch Design of my Cousin  Ned  's and to get us acquainted with no other View than what it has turn'd out He's a strange Creature he has great good Nature but it is great Pity he  has not a little more Oeconomy in regard to his Pocket money's like chaff to him it flies with every wind that blows  Pitt  O that's an unpardonable Sin Madam in my Opinion  Mrs  Buz  And in mine too Sir though his great Fault is I believe being too charitable he pretends that when he sees a Friend or a Neighbour in Distress he can't sleep 'till he has reliev'd 'em  Pitt  Ah that's an abominable Fault for what is another's Poverty to me let every one take Care of themselves I say Besides giving to the Poor is the most unprofitable Way of bestowing Charity in the World you are sure of never having any Return  Mrs  Buz  True Sir very true I've been obliged to lend him Money at different Times to the Amount of two hundred Pounds though it went very much against me to do it had he not been a pretty near Relation I wou'd not have done it on any Account But he has certainly a deal of good Nature and I know too that he'll pay when he has it for I lent him a hundred and twenty Pounds before and I must say he pay'd me very honestly again with good Interest into the Bargain But if I could get him to pay the good two hundred Pounds he owes me now I should hardly risk any more with him I think  Pitt  I'm glad to find you are come to that Resolution Madam I assure youonce or twice a Person may do a good natur'd Thing but I'd have em beware of the third Time least they be flung at last  Mrs  Buz  He has no given me a Note of two hundred Pounds on you Sir I'm amaz'd to think what he can have done for it  Pitt  Why it was a particular Kind of Business to be  ure Madam the Purport of which I shall make bold to acquaint you with some other Opportunity  Mrs  Buz  I have no very great Relish for Secrets Sir  Pitt  Then you are not a Native of this Country I am sure Madam for the People here make it as great a Merit to discover the Secrets of their Neighbours as the Astronomers do to discover new Spots in the Sun and take as great a Pride in declaring 'em to the World  Mrs  Buz  That's a very despicable Character Pray what Time of the Day is it I must begin to think of going  I promis'd to call on a Lady in my Way home upon some very particular Business I should be glad now to know your Terms of Inoculation Perhaps it is not convenient just now Sir to pay the Note I mentioned  Pitt  Quite so quite so Madam I have it at Hand I am never so happy as when my Debts are pay'd  Mrs  Buz  Nay as for that Matter if it had not been convenient you need not have been under any Uneasiness on my Account Sir it will save me the Trouble of sending to my Banker's Tomorrow that's all  Pitt  Here it is Madam  Mrs  Buz  And here is your Note Sir with a Receipt in full on the Back  Pitt  Madam I am very much oblig'd to you  Mrs  Buz  O Sir it is I that am oblig'd  Puts it in her Pocket  Pitt  Now Ma'am now for Inoculation when shall you be ready to prepare  Mrs  Buz  Immediately Sir  Pitt  Very well Madam you shall have your Medicines Tomorrow Morning  Mrs  Buz  My Heart almost fails me already I declare  Pitt  My dear Madam you need not be under the least Apprehensions of Danger It is the mildest undertaking in the World I have had some hundred thousands under my Hands but never had a Patient while under the Operation that had the least Apprehensions of Death nor one that ever made the least Complaint since they left me  Mrs  Buz  Amazing  Pitt  It is amazing indeed Madam but you must imagine I have taken no small Pains in the Studies of Physicks and Metaphysicks to have made a Discovery of this Nature  Mrs  Buz  That is very apparent Sir  Pitt  I do assure you Madam it has been a Work of thirty Years Study I have spared no Pains in consulting the best Authors and was at a vast Expence in travelling for Experience to the most celebrated Capitals in  Europe  and am happy to find at last that my Endeavours were not thrown away but that my Discovery has proved of such general Utility  Mrs  Buz  What an excellent Knack the Doctor has at lying    Aside    There is nothing more conducive to Happiness than the general Approbation of the Public nor nothing so hard to obtain  Pitt  Very well observ'd indeed Madam but I can very well sa  with a favourite Author of mine "Successo filicitatibusque" And in another Part where he compares a great Genius to a Skyrocket "Skirockitum Skirocteribus  Mrs  Buz  So so the Doctor is going to purge me with DogLatin    Aside    Your Author's Excellence is thrown away upon me Sir I am quite a Stranger to Latin French was always my favourite Language I ever considered Latin as too masculine a Study for the Ladies  Pitt  Madam there's such a Melody in the Soundsbut as you say Madam it may be too masculine for the Ladies too sonorous  Enter  Pestle  Pest  Sir Mrs  Bugg  bid me tell you she was agoing and desire you wou'd let her have the Lotion with her  Pitt  Tell her I'll wait on her directly    Exit Pestle    You must know Madam the Lady is now and then troubled with a Pimple and she is terribly afraid of spoiling her Face I promis'd her something to prevent 'em and I dare say she would not go without it for the World  Mrs  Buz  I am sometimes troubled with 'em myself though I am not afraid that they'll spoil my Beauty I assure you Sir but have you really a Medicine of that Kind  Pitt  A most infallible one Madam which beautifies the Skin amazingly for which I have had the King's Patent long since  Mrs  Buz  You must have a wonderful Knowledge in your Profession Sir to have been able to make so many great and useful Discoveries  Pitt  Tolerable Madam tolerable  Mrs  Buz  And so you have obtain'd a Patent Sir I should like vastly to see the Nature of a Thing of that Kind  Pitt  Shou'd you Madam  Mrs  Buz  I should Sir I must confess  Pitt  With your Leave Madam I'll just go and send Mrs  Bugg  off and bring it with me  Mrs  Buz  Sir I am asham'd of giving you the Trouble  Pitt  Not any Trouble not the least I assure you Madam  Ex  Pittem  Mrs  Buzby  solus    Mrs  Buz  What a ridiculous Lyar he is he knows no more of Medicine than a Ratcatcher about four Years

blame The Doctor has forgot his Lease    takes up the Lease as she supposes and opens it    Ah what is here by all my Hopes Mr  Danbury  's Will O thou pernicious Fiend Yes thou curs'd Villain it is a Lease which thou shalt hold no more What shall I do I'll secure me this however and if he asks me for it I'll disown it I shall hate to trifle longer in this Disguise But here he comes  Reenter  Pittem  Pitt  I protest Madam I am quite asham'd of myself I have mislaid my Patent by some Accident or other and cannot find it if it were not for the Fear of tiring your Patience Madam I would go and make farther Search  Mrs  Buz  O by no Means Sir another Opportunity will do quite as wellbesides Sir I cannot possibly stay any longer I shall be benighted and I am one of the most fearful Creatures in Nature  Pitt  May Health and Happiness go with you Madam good Night good Night  Exit Mrs  Buzby  Pittem  Solus    A charming Lady an excellent Lady upon my Word I have won her as the

lofty Temples and her costly Gems  Her murm'ring  Loddon  and her sister  Thames    Admit my Muse to tread in humble lays  And sing tho' lowly in fair  Chelmer  's praise  What tho' thy Banks by Kings were never trod  No stately Savage grac'd thee with a Nod  Thou happ'ly 'scap'd the arbitrary Frown  Nor felt the Curse of being near a Crown  Once on a Time there liv'd a rural Pair  The gentle  Philo  and  Salina  fair  The sad  Leander  lov'd not more than he  When arm'd with Love he dar'd the raging Sea  No story'd Fair cou'd ever boast a Mind  More pure no Maid cou'd shew an Heart more kind  Than she her Tresses play'd about her Waist  In flowing Curls her Head with Posies grac'd  Like the fair Lilly essenc'd ev'ry Gale  While o'er the Lawn she trip't or thro' the Dale  On  Chelmer  's Banks the gentle Pair first trod  Ere this fair Land felt vile Oppression's Rod  In golden Times when Love o'er Interest stood  And Statesmen sought their King and Country's Good  He tended Flocks while she the Distaff play'd  Upon the Brow or near some friendly Shade  Long had their Breast's felt  Cupid  's gentle Flame  And stifl'd Love with common Friendship's name  Till bursting forth the Blaze dispell'd the Smoke  And  Philo  first to his  Salina  spoke  We've long my fair  Salina  trod these Plains  In Summer's Heat and Winter's drenching Rains  We often steal the Honey from the Bees  And oft we pluck the Blossom from the Trees  Their tempting Sweetness urge us to the Deed  But yet we find 'em cloy us as we feed  There grows one Flower yet that I revere  Survives in Bloom throughout the killing Year  Whose tempting Blush and neverfading Smell  By far all Blossoms of the Spring excell  Whose damask Leaves distill a balmy Dew  That breeds Desire and maintains it too  I oft behold it as I tread the Mead  And every Day my longing eyes I feed  With fond Desire till at last I pine  Sigh to myself and wish the Blossom mine  Still must I pine still must I sigh in vain  'Tis  ou must ease my Hopes and cure my Pain  Within your Reach it hangs within your Breast  To make me wretched or to make me blest  Nay cease to grieve the fair  Salina  cry'd  Have you e'er ask'd me ought that I deny'd  Sure you have found me selfish and unkind  To think I bear about so poor a Mind  Did  ou a Lambkin or an Heifer chuse  You never knew me such a Boon refuse  Then bring me  Philo  where this Wonder grows  Be it a Lilly Hyacinth or Rose  Be  the fairest Bud that ever sprung  The sweetest Bluebell ever Fair rung  Within my Reach or in my Power to give  If  Philo  ask it  Philo  shall receive  Thanks lovely Maidbut O you'll change your Mind  When you this fair this blooming Beauty find  Nay doubt me not nor yet my Truth decry  Let not my Word upon Suspicion die  Let not your Thoughts be timid and unkind  Till I've my promise and my Truth declin'd  No tempting Sweet no Rose that ever sprung  Shall make me faulter in my Heart or Tongue  Ne'er let me tread these fertile Banks again  Nor walk with  Philo  o'er the verdant Plain  When I forget the Promise I have made  Banish  Salina  to some distant Shade  Nay lovely Maid be ever ever near  Shou'd you shou'd fair  Salina  disappear  These lonely Plains wou'd be more lonely still  And Burs and Thistles grow on every Hill  To yonder Brook then let us bend our way  And there behold the Prodigy of  May    And there behold my Heart my Soul's Delight  My wish by Day and all my Dreams by Night  Methinks 'tis strange that one poor simple Flower  Shou'd o'er an Heart like yours obtain such Power  The Bee 'tis true and Butterfly will rove  And sport around with animated Love  When ev'ry Flower rising to their Sight  Invites the Heart and yields 'em new Delight  The Sun declines apace let's instant go  And try if I'll not keep my Word or no  Then straight they tript together o'er the Plain  And Bands of  Cupids  follow'd in a Train  To bind two Hearts with Wreaths that never fade  And prove the Promise of a tender Maid  The Banks they reach and next the crystal Brook  In which young  Philo  bid  Salina  look  The Banks are pleasant and the Stream is clear  But yet I see Rose or Lilly near  Some cruel Swain has stole it e'er we came  In such a Case can I be ought to blame  Say can you nothing in the Stream behold  No perfect Beauty of celestial Mould  See you not something like yourself appear  The Substance of that Shadow I revere  Thou art the Substance thou my boasted Bloom  'Tis thou must ease my Heart or seal my Doom  Ungen'rous Swain how cou'd you thus ensnare  With study'd Arts a poor unguarded Fair  Am I the fairest  Philo  ever saw  Cou'd poor  Salina  such Desire draw  Alas I grieve to think what I have done  Things end in Sorrow that are rash begun  Let me recall it sure I was asleep  Must I indeed my artless Promise keep  Must I perforce then give myself away  To be the Idol of a single Day  To be forgot if  Philo  ere shou'd see  Some other Maid still fairer yet than me  But O remember shou'd you ever find  Some other Maid more fair more true more kind  Forget not then who once you deem'd a Prize▪  Nor make your captive Fair a Sacrifice  O never never talk not so again  Such fancy'd Ills will rive my Heart in twain  Here do I vow and when I prove unkind  Teem down ye Clouds and unloose the Wind  Let forked Lightning thro' my Cottage shoot  And Thunder tear whole Forests by the Root  Let every Lamb that in my Pastures stray  By turgid Floods be caught and wash'd away  Let me be sunk in Famine and Despair  Beneath the Horror of the warring air  Nay gentle Swain my Heart wou'd bleed to see  Thee made the Spectacle of Misery  Shou'd thou prove kind and keep thy Passion true  I wou'd not wish a fairer Swain than you  When I prove falsebut that can never be  My Health my Life my ev'ry Hope's in thee  If this fond Heart shou'd e'er a Traitor prove  And violate the sacred Laws of Love  Let Shame be painted on my guilty Breast  And Sorrow hunt me from the Bed of Rest  What shall I sayfor O I cannot feign  What I am not were I the World to gain  What shall I say to make my fair believe  These Tears are real  Cease O cease to grieve  Here take my Hand my Heart I wou'd resign  But that has fled this many a Day to thine  My Breast forlorn oft led me to despair  Save when methought I felt my  Philo  's there  O let me clasp it to my panting Breast  Heal my fond Heart and give it endless Rest  Ye Woods and Vales that heard the lovely Sound  Tell it in Ecchos to the Plains around  Let the sweet Woodlark raise his Notes divine  Telling each Swain that fai  a  's mine  THE PROLOGUE TO THE Merry Midnight Mistake  WITH much Reluctance they have brought me here  To try your Patience and to cure my Fear  But if in trying I shou'd chance to fail  You soon shall see me Frenchmanlike turn Tail  Our Author's here behind in a such a Taking  Scratching his Head shivering and shaking  I or fear his comic Bantling shou'd not please  He here presents you with his Prologue Fees  A little Ca  ting and a thousand Smiles  For complimenting more than Truth beguiles  So he poor man since Canting is the Mode  Must needs go plodding in the common Road  Begs you'd permit his Brat walk unmolested  Shou'd the poor Thing chance to be divested  Of  Congreve's  Wit or  Dryd  n  's nice Conn  tion  For sure the poorest Child claims some Protection  And if in walking it should chance to trip  Or falling cut its little Nose or Lip  You'll please to save the poor declining thing  By kindly catching hold the leadingstring  Some proudly pleas'd in finding out a Fault  But mostly those who can't digest a Thought  Rude nature gave 'em Rancour to condemn  But bury'd all their Candour in their Phlegm  Or like enough some sage good Dame may frown  Displeas'd with every Notion but her own  And in her Pride from pious Motives say  "There's nothing good can come from out a Play"  And kindly shewing 'tis not from her Spleen  But judges wisely what she's never seen  For many Author's have unjustly ble  d  Their plays being damn'd before a Line was read  The Actors too your candour must implore  If Actors those who never play'd before  Unskill'd unstudied in these Stage Affairs  They've other Business to engross their cares  They only do it to oblige a Friend  No other Motive secret Pride or End  Save thisto force a gentle Smile from you  We'll do our best'tis all the Best can do  THE EPILOGUE TO THE  Merry Midnight Mistake  I Tell you I willPlague on't I'm so teaz'd  The Author thinks his Firstling has not pleas'd  I say he's quite mista'en but all wont do  He'll not be easy 'till he hears from you  He wants poor me your Anger to amuse  By trumping up some frivolous Excuse  I fain wou'd lay it on the  Acting  now  But that is Modesty will not allow  I'd lay it on the Prompterif I knew how  You plainly see I've no Excuse at all  The best way'll be to let the Curtain fall  Yet holdI've something yet to sayaye right  We'll do it better Sirs another Night  We'll be more perfect act with better Spirit  For Application is the Way to Merit  Fear's the great Tyrant in a doubtful Breast  From thence our first Attempts are seldom best  Cou'd we have acted as we did intend  Not one Soul here but would have been our Friend  Thanks for that Smileby  Jove  mehinks I hear  You kindly say"We need not be in Fear"  "Because there's none but Friends and Neighbours here"  Thanks for this good Confession 'tis very kind  I long to carry this good News behind  They're all distress'd to know what I have done  And I'm as much impatient to be gone  THE PROLOGUE TO  Redowald  a  Masque    WERE it not Sirs impossible to find  A Subject suiting ev'ry Readers Mind  A Prologue or a Preface would be vain  Because we know that no one would complain  And yet I've seen a well wrote Piece go down  And please tho' rare the better half the Town  An half bred Prig to shew superior Skill  That scarce cou'd read or knew the use of Quill  Has sally'd forth with Envy in each Eye  And Spight of Fate would Shame itself defy  And Critic like to do the Thing he ought  Would find a Beauty in an errant Fault  That not enough to prove himself a Fool  Would murder Beauties by the self same Rule  Our infant Author hopes his Piece may fall  In better Hands or else in none at all  Just from the Lap of Genius bends his Way  To fam'd  Panassion  Fields where Poets stray  But finds it cull'd and shorn a barren Field  That's furnish'd Ages now will hardly yield  A single Shrub but what we've seen before  Beclipt and turn'd and twin'd into a Score  Such as they are he brings to public View  And if you find there's old ones with the New  Pray tell me Sir that famous Poet's Name  That living Bard that does not do the same  If near his Neighbour's Produce he intrudes  For Nature's self has her Similitudes  The selfsame Thought might strike both you and me  And I the least stand charg'd of Piracy  You've here in Hand a little moral Piece  Nor Stole from  France  nor  Italy  nor  Greece    A Child of Fancy nurtur'd by the Mind  If bad comes on't I know 'twas well design'd  THE EPILOGUE TO  Redowald  a Masque  SHou'd some grave wit our Author's Piece decry  And damn the Plot from meer Acerbity  Let gentle Candour rise and take his Part  And own he's shewn more Genius than Art  To write a Play you'll own is no small Task  Then what must be the Labour of a Masque  Fancy must aid the Bard where Nature fails  And daring Genius muster all her Sails  Our nonag'd Poet unregarding  Time    Slipt from his Wing and touring forth sublime  Survey'd the Muses with enraptur'd Eyes  Ador'd their Tracks and mounted to the Skies  Shou'd it be said Ambition was the Cause  That urg'd him first to writeor vain Applause  Ere you convict him of a Thirst for Fame  Turn to the Title and find out his Name  The Pretty Maid of  Chelmsford    A Pretty Maid both kind and fair  Dwells in  Chelmsford  Town  Her pleasing Smiles her easy Air  Engages Fop and Clown  Being accosted t'other Day  By a clumsy 'Squire  Who ask'd her if she knew the Way  To quench a raging Fire  Water Sir reply'd the Maid  Will quench it in a Trice  O no said he you little Jade  I've try'd that once or twice  Then Sir said she 'tis past my Skill  To tell you what will do  I'm sure said he you know what will  There's nothing can but you  Alasaday what do you mean  Reply'd the pretty Fair  I'd have you try it once again  You never shou'd despair  Despair I cannot cry'd the 'Squire  While you are in my Sight  'Tis you must quench the burning Fire  You set it first alight  Then strait he clasp'd her round the Waist  And forc'd from her a Kiss  Ho ho said she is that your Taste  Then pray you Sir take this  And with a Pail plac'd at the Door  She sluic'd the amorous 'Squire  Your'e welcome Sir to this and more  To quench your raging Fire  THE COTTAGERS AN OPERA IN THREE ACTS  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Brainly  a Country Squire  Celon  a

angry don't think that I approve of her Proceedings no far be it from me but I can't help taking Notice how ready the Fellow is to tell you of her Faults for he sees they work upon you to Excess and you are as eager to hear what gives you so much Pain if he had generously told me of it before I wou'd have put a Stop to it ere now and you might have escap'd all this Uneasiness for if our Children are to bear the Censure of our Servants what Child will escape Slander I don't doubt what he has said to be true but while he sees it feeds your Anger and he finds himself listen'd to he may turn Surmises into Facts and she may be stigmatiz'd where e'er she goes as being guilty of what she never dreamt of  Brain  Well well it does not signify holding this Harangue about herI'm determin'd to

 THE END  THE FIRST of MAY  _MY Tale I take from Times of old  When Truth was more esteem'd than Gold  When Pride walk'd threadbare and despis'd  When Folks were better exercis'd  Than nowadays when Broils and Strife  Defiles the Narra' of each Life  A Country Villa near a Green  Inhabitants but twice Sixteen  An honest 'Squire held the Hall  Surrounded by a Turfen Wall  The Friend and Landlord of 'em all  A Neighbourhood so well inclin'd  So simple honest and so kind  Each try'd his Neighbour to excell  In Friendship and in doing well  As soon as Morning Dawn appear'd  Or early Chanticleer was heard  E'er the fond Herds began to feed  Or Faires fled the rising Mead  The thrifty Villagers arose  And from the Bed of sweet Repose  They met the Labours of the Day  And chearful sung the Time away  At Eventide when Work was done  They all return'd at setting Sun  And met upon the Plainwith Glee  They pip'd and danc'd upon the Lee  There in a lowly simple State  They felt the joys that fly the Great  No Load of Conscience gall'd their Breast  Content and Labour gave 'em rest  'Twas now the rosy Morn of  May    When  Flora  in her best Array  Bedeek'd each little rising Hill  With Cowslips sweet or Daffodil  A Maypole tall with Garlands hung  And rows of Birds Eggs neatly strung  Was plac'd upon a verdant Green  A Tribute to the Morning's Queen  Each Rustic summons forth his Fair  And round the Pole they all repair  The 'Squire 'mongst the rest arose  As 'twas his Custom to dispose  Of various Gifts upon that Day  And gave good Ale and Cakes away  Twelve Garlands one small Hillock grac'd  In simple Order each was plac'd  The honest 'Squire now propos'd  That each by Choice shou'd be dispos'd  Said ev'ry Swain had equal Right  To any Garland now in Sight  And all beneath if ought shou'd be  To claim his Right and Property  For each some little Prize contain'd  So that the Loser something gain'd  Tho' some were greater than the rest  Each Swain now strove to choose the best  Young  Ralph  a fair and comely Swain  The very Hero of the Plain  Beheld fair  Alecy  on her Way  No star so bright no Nymph so gay  Her small and easy Waist was bound  With Wreaths most sweet her Head was crown'd  With ev'ry Flower of the Field  That  Flora  's self to her might yield  She on her Head a Garland bore  Its equal ne'er was seen before  Young  Ralph  set off full Speed to meet  This lovely Maid this Nymph compleat  And struck the rest with great Surprize  To see him claim her for his Prize  He first bereav'd her of her Crown  And claim'd the Maiden all his own  Now ev'ry Youngster on the Plain  Look'd with Envy on the Swain  But all in Justice did declare  He won the Maidthe Trick was fair  The 'Squire pauz'd and shook his Head  His hearty smile of Humour fled  To see his Child another's Claim  And now he 'gan himself to blame  The Swain beheld the good Man's Eyes  With Tears he offer'd back his Prize  The 'Squire charm'd at such a Deed  Cry'd you deserve her now indeed  It glads me much young Swain to find  Thou bear'st so great so good a Mind  Here take her LadI murmur not  If she's contented with her Lot  She smil'd Consent and chear'd the drooping Swain  She gave her Hand her Meaning to explain  The 'Squire saw and bless'd the blooming Pair  And three loud Vollies broke the peaceful Air  CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE  COUNTRY  THE Mountain tops were tipt with driven Snow  And Silver white were all the Vales below  When ceasing thro' the frozen Field to roam  Each Country Bumpkin ambles to his Home  Enjoys what oft his betters do admire  In Winter Timea comfortable Fire  There with his Spouse and rosy Brats regale  In simple Mirth all round a Mug of Ale  And now when some sage venerable 'Squire  Does from the Noise of this great Town retire  To end his Days forgetting King and Court  And turns once more unto his youthful Sport  But feels the Want of Strength the Want of Sight  And feels the Winter more severely bite  Than when his Blood some forty Years ago  Wou'd reek with Ardour in  December  's Snow  Climb the steep Hill the flowing Riv'let fly  And join with Speed the chearful Huntsman's Cry  'Till the deep Vally eccho'd to the Sky  Less Exercise poor Man will now content  Infirmity will teach him to repent  And make Attonement for a Life of Sin  At threescore Years 'tis Time sure to begin  The Night approach'd each Friend receives his Guest  To drink an Health or crack some merry Jest  To eat and drink in hearty free Good will  And all the Troubles of the Day to kill  Tho' Ven'son fumes ne'er taint their homely Board  The feast on what they better can afford  A good Sir Loin a Pudding full of Plumbs  Smoaking and hot upon the Table comes  No Prince on Earth cou'd here refuse to eat  So nice the Pudding and so sweet the Meat  Once on a Time the Fire Side was grac'd  With six true pair of Lovers round it plac'd  When biting Frost and Snow bespread the Green  The Lads here serv'd their Lasses for a Skreen  By holding them as we do often see  The Lads in Towntheir Lasses on their Knee  Now each in Turn wou'd Sing a merry Song  And some wou'd tell a Story very long  While all attentive wou'd with Wonder hear  And shew'd with Eyes of Love an Heart of Fear  One who refused in his Turn to sing  Told a sad Story of a murder'd King  Another cry'd he heard his Granny say  As she was passing thro' a lonely way  The Night was dark and Glowworms did appear  When ev'ry Tree then added to her Fear  And passing by a lonely Church Yard Wall  The Grave Stones mov'd the Steeple shook and all  Another now began a woeful Tale  The very Thought of which oft turn'd him pale  Once said he a Lady fair and tall  Did walk a Nights upon our Garden Wall  She sometimes like a Sow and Pigs appear'd  And sometimes like a Jew with a long Beard  And sometimes like a greyhound sleek and trim  Sometimes like a Lion very Grim  And once my Father said he saw it stand  With a bleeding Heart grasp't within its Hand  And once he heard it like a Raven croak  And thrice they say it to our Parson spoke  At this sad Tale not one in all the House  But even fear'd the moving of a Mouse  O lack aDay cry'd one fair trembling Maid  I fear to move I am so much afraid  Another list'ning thought she heard a Voice  Another cry'd I'm sure I heard a Noise  Hush was the Word while each with list'ning Fear  Did as it were all statuestruck appear  Nor Eye nor Finger now was seen to move  But each pale Maid cling'd fast about her Love  And all the more from Fear than from Desire  Mov'd by Degrees almost into the Fire  A dreadful Clatter all at once was heard  And in a Trice the Fire Side was clear'd  Out at the Door they helterskelter ran  Nor 'till the Morning did there one return  The Parson and the Clerk at Noon
