 VIOLENTA OR THE Rewards of Virtue TURN'D FROM  BOCCACE  into VERSE  LONDON  Printed for  John Nutt  near  StationersHall    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Earl of  SCARSDALE  My Lord  I have long had an eager Ambition to see Your Lordship's Name amongst those Noble  Patrons  to whom I have presum'd to offer my unworthy Attempts in Poetry I acknowledge I want Merit infinitely in all these Undertakings and am so Humble to own  more Faults than the severest  Critick  will give himself the Trouble to find yet such has been my Good Fortune that I have often found Indulgeance from the Greatest and Best of our Kingdom This in Part mitigates my Fears when I Venture to approach Your Lordship with so worthless a Piece  I have the Honour to know Your Lordship so well as to depend on Your Goodness when I am afraid of Your Judgment to believe you so kind and forgiving as to smile at Follies that have no other Intention than Your innocent Diversion After having confess'd the Weakness of my Pen I may be justly excus'd from Aiming  at a Character generous as Your Lordships and shining with those Heroick Qualities which ought to be inherent to the Great nor let the severest Moralist Reflect upon the Incouragement of Things of this Nature since the noblest Lives Fame has transmitted to Posterity have always been  Patrons  of Poetry  May Your Lordship long continue in that State of Happiness Your Noble Birth and Fortunes have fixed You and Master of those excellent Indowments Justice and Humanity with that unalterable Firmness to Your Word and Principle These Virtues My Lord render You the Ornament  of the Nation and Nobility and in Your unbending Hours may You still remain a Favourer of the Stage and vouchsafe to listen to the unartful Numbers of this Poem and be inclind to pardon the Daring Boldness of Inscribing it to Your Lordship by  My Lord  Your Lordship's most Obedient and Humble Servant  ERRATA  PAge l  ult  dele  a  p l r  pursue  for  preserve  and  Wretch  for  Wrath  p

Distress  How Fate controuls the Council of the Wise  How often hid in Beauties fair Disguise  Foul Deceit and treacherous Falshood Lies  How Virtue breaks the dark'ning Clouds away  And from Misfortunes Night  arises gay  Gives double Lustre to the glorious Day  Here may the Old a mighty Pattern find  And view the Trial of the noblest Mind  Soft Love to please the chearful happy Young  With strange Adventures fills th' Historick Song  'Twas in those warlike Days when growing  France  Would with extending Power her Realms advance  The Sturdy  Germans  late the  Roman  Pride  Still struggl'd hard still push'd and gor'd her Side  Vast Troops they rais'd the King and Prince their Head  Fill'd with their Youth and by their Heroes led  This done there follows and important Care  Whom they shall trust their great Vicegerent here  The  Dauphin  to his Father recommends  One of his dearest most deserving Friends  The Count of  Angiers  then in high Renown  Fittest to guard and fill the empty Throne  The Choice with universal Joy's approv'd  Never was Man like Noble  Angiers  lov'd  Against his Will the Mourner's drawn to Court  Who had forsook the World and all Resort  To the dark Groves and silent Caves was fled  To weep in vain his dear  Maria  dead  For Tyrant Death had snatch'd a Faithful Wife  And with her all the Joys of hapless  Angiers  Life  The World to him had now no pleasing Charms  Nor wak'd he with the once lov'd Sound of Arms  Thus liv'd the Count to eating Grief a Prey  'Till by his Master's Voice he's forc'd away  He heard and knew he must the King obey  He comes and soon the mighty Charge receives  And for his Trust his Faith and Honour gives  And now the  Dauphin  ready to depart  Presses his faithful  Angiers  to his Heart  Oh thou my Dear and long try'd Friend he said  And on his Bosom kindly lean'd his Head  To thee my Father leaves his Kingdom's Care  No Subject boasts of Pow'r a larger Share  The Trust is weighty and the Trouble great  To Rule this potent Land and Pop'lar State  Yet my best Friend there is more Business yet  I must ingage thy most peculiar Care  To guard and please that bright Illustrious Fair  My charming Wife whose far fam'd Beauty may  While I to distant Camps am call'd away  By some ill Fate my Peace at Home betray  Watch that  Cleora  undisturb'd may rest  In serving her thou gain'st thy Master's Breast  This said he clasp'd him fast nor staid Replies  But cry'd I read thy Answer in thy Eyes  Quick to his warlike Troops he took his Way  Whose youthful Heat cou'd brook no longer stay  Angiers  is left the sole Commander now  To him the officious Courtiers crowd and bow  He look'd as born to the Honours of his Place  His Noble Soul enrich'd with every Grace  Shone with Majestick Sweetness in his Face  Just ripen'd full from Youths delightful Bloom  Enough to promise happy Years to come  With most judicious Policy he Reigns  Supports the Good the Bad his Pow'r restrains  Remembring well his Master's last Command  He Signs all Orders with  Cleora  's Hand  Cleora  bright as the approaching Day  When Fair  Aurora  does her Beams display  And gilds the Mountains with her blooming Ray  In her ten Thousand Graces Revelling meet  The blowing Rose not half so lovely sweet  She look'd as if her Eyes commanded Fate  Form'd equal to her Great Imperial State  Yet on her Soul a yielding Softness sate  And Noble  Angiers  was her chiefest Care  On him she smil'd with a familiar Air  Try'd every way that might his Griefs redress  Oblige the Count and make that Passion less  With all Delights that Prudence could afford  Or  Pallace  yield in th' Absence of its Lord  Sometimes with Rural Sports they'd chase the Hind  Whose nimble Feet seem to outstrip the Wind  Then Dancing Balls and Masquerades and Plays  With these they wast the Nights and chearful Days  With these Delights  Cleora  kindly strove  To drive from  Angiers  Breast all former Love  Abroad they prosper Couriers daily bring  News of Success both by the Prince and King  Now in the height of Bliss just  Angiers  stood  Supreamly Great and more supreamly Good  Yet short the Joys which humane Souls allure  Nor can we make our Happiness secure  Vain Man as well on Sand may Structures lay  As hope to fix his Fate in mould'ring Clay  A Thousand Accidents frail Life attend  And Mortals only know that Life must end  Our Paths seem hid in the dark Book of Fate  The Doom once past Precaution comes too late  So luckless  Angiers  Thoughtful Bold and Wise  Esteem'd his Court another Paradice  Yet to his Cost the Noble Heroe found  Ten Thousand Snakes beneath th' enamell'd Ground  Had he foreseen his Fate tho' but in Dreams  He must have dy'd at Terrour of the Scenes  Which thus began  Cleora  Orders sends  To th' Count her Councellor and best of Friends  To her Appartment he must straight repair  For Business of Importance waits him there  With hast and Loyal Zeal the Victim came  Dress'd like Loves Goddess was the princely Dame  Her Eyes had equal Brightness equal Flame  Her Mantle Azure fill'd with Stars of Gold  And shining Jems adorn'd each curious Fold  Careless thrown scarce cover'd half her Breast  But to the wond'ring Eye expos'd the rest  Choice Garlands crown'd her lovely flowing Hair  Yet seem to lose their Lustre planted there  The Rose not half so fresh the Lilly half so fair  Supinely on a glorious Couch she lay  As she wou'd Rival the bright Lamp of Day  Her Head she lean'd upon her snowy Hand  Whilst  Angiers  kneels to hear her dread Command  The bright attending Nymphs that round her wait  Retire not pry into Affairs of State  When thus the charming Princess Silence broke  And with a Smile to faithful  Angiers  spoke  Arise my Noble Lord and seat you there  For I have much to say and you must hear  You once did feel great Love's Tyranick Reign  And sure must kindly Sigh when I complain  The  Dauphin  writes the Wars will take much Time  And me neglected leaves in Beauties Prime  Hard Fate a Sacrifice to publick Voice  I never knew the Priveledge of Choice  When in my Father's Court the wond'ring Croud  Still gaz'd and Poets sung my Praises loud  They haild my Youth and wish'd me all Delights  But I'm condemn'd to care and widdow'd Nights  The sad Reverse of all their Blessings prove  And must conclude the  Dauphin  does not love  The flattering World and each reflecting Glass  Owns matchless Glory's in this injur'd Face  Forgive me if I break our Sexes Laws  When wrong'd we may assert our Right our Cause  Speak  Angiers  were I circled in thy Arms  Wou'dst thou for Camps forsake Loves softer Charms  Up to her Cheeks a conscious Blush straight flies  And thousand Cupids revell'd in her Eyes  Angiers  arose with Reverence profound  Began nor rais'd his fix'd Eyes from the Ground  Most Divine Princess you may rest assur'd  You are the Treasure of your absent Lord  By Glory torn from Loves delightful Chains  Yet in his Heart alone  Cleora  Reigns  Oh had you heard the tender Charge he gave  Of you his Lifes Reward to me his Slave  You never cou'd his Constancy suspect  But call that Violence which now you term Neglect  Scarce cou'd the Fair her soft Confusion hide  And half compos'd she blushing thus reply'd  To  Angiers  then did he  Cleora  leave  For that one Act I all his Faults forgive  To  Angiers  freely I my self resign  Too sure I'm his Heaven make the Heroe mine  What racking Fires are these that fill my Breast  My Soul distract and rob my Eyes of Rest  Oh turn not from me since too much I've said  And the soft Secret of my Soul betray'd  If I'm refus'd Death is the Punishment  But Love and Pleasure wait on kind Consent  Down at her Feet the trembling  Angiers  fell  His Terrour and Surprize no Tongue can tell  His Faulters not knows which way to begin  The Princess he reveres abhors the Sin  'Tis a hard Task Superiors to reprove  And mighty Vertue to resist such Love  Amaz'd he spoke in th' mildest Phrase he cou'd  Instructs the Charming Princess to be good  Then cry'd What Frenzy's this that dares controul  The Noble Greatness of  Cleora  's Soul  You're born Supream your Lots are pair'd above  Bounded by Fate from an inferiour Love  The  Dauphin  first of Men already's yours  By Right Divine his lawful Claim secures  I own ye beautious as the blooming  May  Fair as the First e'er Nature knew decay  Still in your Looks you wear all conquering Charms  But these are destin'd for my Masters Arms  I'd give my Body to consuming Flame  Leave any other Blot upon my Name  E'er wrong in you that Royal Masters Fame  She rose with Fury and would hear no more  Disdain now work'd her boyling Spirits o'er  Those Eyes shot Fire that languish'd Love before  She starts then paus'd and with a scornful Smile  Foretold the Mischiefs and intended Guile  The Count who knew no Ill suspected none  Blush'd for her Shame and wish'd himself alone  When straight she threw her Mantle on the Ground  Her Garland tore her curling Hair unbound  Then seizing  Angiers  with a Scream of Woe  Cry'd Murder Villain Traytor let me go  The Voice of Terrour thro' the Pallace flies  Follow'd still with loud incessant Cries  Help all oh help or lost  Cleora  dies  All hast and swift as Thought th' Apartment's fill'd  Where on the Flore the Princess they beheld  The injur'd Earl confus'd and pale they View  This Turn rob'd him of Speech and Reason too  When false  Cleora  rear'd her weeping Face  And Beauty gave to Sorrow double Grace  Look on the base perfidious Man she said  By whom the  Dauphin  and you're all betray'd  Trusting his Faith I charg'd him to declare  Th' Affairs of State and Business of the War  The Conference strict Secrecy requir'd  My waiting Servants by Command retir'd  But e'er he half the  Dauphins  Will declar'd  Seiz'd on my Hand around like Madness star'd  And cry'd the Regent Princess now is mine  She shall her Honour or her Life resign  For I am wild with Loves ungovern'd Rage  Possession only can my Flame asswage  With the Surprize I scarce cou'd raise my Breath  To call your Aid which has secur'd from Death  Who cou'd suppose the Raising of the Dead  Might see th' Amazement that each Face o'erspread  None but the Wicked this sad Tale does please  Nor dare his Enemies his Person seize  Alone disgrac'd he to his Palace goes  And there reflects on his malicious Foes  Thinks on the Weight of his pretended Crimes  Resolves to fly his coming Fate betimes  For if he shou'd declare h  Innocence  And on the Princess cast the Black Offence  The Laurels which the Prince abroad did gain  Wou'd wither all at the unhappy Stain  Resolv'd alone the rigorous Fate to bear  And own the Guilt rather than lay't on her  His speedy Flight is straight condemn'd by Fame  And all ill Tongues are busie with his Name  He takes two tender Pledges Wedlock gave  The only Treasure he had Power to save  With him  Ernesto  flies faithful and just  Who long had serv'd and ne'er betray'd his Trust  Thus the Great Man whom that same rising Morn  Saw dress'd in Honours that such Trust adorn  With crowded Levee and a waiting Train  All the gay Pomps that can Observance Gain  Now stript forsaken bare disgrac'd and lost  Wanders to find some hospitable Coast  And as he travel'd towards the distant Sea  A dreadful Light directs his doubtful Way  He views his Castle blazing in one Flame  The fierce Revenge of that invet'rate Dame  Unmov'd he saw the Structure tumble down  And cry'd thou can'st not bury my Renown  In time perhaps my Truth may come to Light  My Fame outshine those Tow'rs that Blaze so bright  And the mistaken World tho' late may see  A conspicuous Virtue in unhappy Me  Now in a Cell they snatch a short Repose  Soon as the Sun the wakeful  Angiers  rose  His Courage yet unshock'd by adverse Fate  His Noble Suff'ring show'd him truly Great  But oh when he beheld his little Pair  The Mothers Darlings and the Fathers Care  In vain upon their Nurse and Servants call  The Floods so long restrain'd in Torrents fall  At their sad Wants he cou'd no more forbear  Indulg'd his Grief with many a pitying Fear  The tender Charge who thus awak'd his Care  A little Son and lovely Daughter were  Both Beautious seem'd as form'd by Hands Divine  The Parents Graces in the Infants shine  Lewis  the Son a charming sprightly Boy  The first dear Fruit of  Angiers  Nuptial Joy  His other Hope his Darling Daughter's Name  Was    sacred still to Fame  The helpless Infants the wrong'd  Angiers  view'd  Their woes the dear  Maria  's lost renew'd  Dash'd by Dispair and grov'ling on the Earth  Curs'd the Malignant Star that rul'd his Birth  Like some sad Wretch long strugling for the Shore  He sinks and gives his hopeless Labour o'er  'Till old  Ernesto  urg'd him to remove  By that fond Care and that pater'nal Love  If you neglect your Princess Wroth to fly  Then next prepare to see your Children dye  Revenge will touch you in the tend'rest Part  Her Rage will wound thro' theirs your Manly Heart  He found 'twas vain to make a useless Moan  The Father and the unhappy Babes must on  At length they  Calice  reach'd and there they found  A Passage Ship for neighbouring  England  bound  He gets an humble Weed md poor Disguise  Besmears his Face and vai  his Noble Eyes  To shun the swift Pursuit of eager Enemies  Imbark'd he turns towards his native Land  Tho' injur'd much he sighs to leave the  Strand  And softly murmurs o'er his riged Fate  Undone by Love far worse than Mortal Hate  Yet still he bids the list'ning Winds forbear  Nor waft the Story to the  Dauphin  's Ear  For his sweet Peace he barters all his own  Neglects the Fame which did his Actions crown  Wives Errours on the Husbands Head remain  To keep the  Dauphin  clear he bears himself the Stain  Cleora  canst thou have a peaceful Thought  Whose lawless Fires this mighty Ruine brought  Poor  Angiers  still pursu'd by his ill Fate  As if the Winds joyn'd with  Cleora  's Hate  Adverse they toss the Vessel on the Seas  Like his tempestuous Mind no Calm no Ease  These Toils to old  Ernesto  were unknown  A gentle Servitude his Years did crown  Unable now in his declining Age  To act a longer Part on this rough Stage  Pale Death the last Retreat and sure Relief  Came to his Aid and ends his Life and Grief  The gashly Tyrant he seems joy'd to meet  And sinks beneath his troubled Masters Feet  There was no need of this griev'd  Angiers  said  Will Heaven still preserve the Wrath it made  Why was this added to my Misery  That thou my poor  Ernesto  too must die  Now of a Sudden all the Seas grow Calm  As if his Grief had hush'd the raging Storm  At length the fair white chalky Cliffs they spy  A joyful Sight to every Sailor's Eye  Only the Earl who knows  ot where to go  Alone expects variety of Woe  The Travellers wou'd fain his Sorrows chear  Inquire his Name what Course he meant to stear  He answers with a Sigh I cannot stray  The Wretched never fear to lose their Way  In the same Ship a venerable Man  Well mark'd the Count and then with Tears began  Whoe'er thou art says he within thy Face  Is written spotted Truth and matchless Grace  And thy young Cherubs seem of heav'nly Race  Then haste thee Stranger to our Nations Pride  To that great Mart where gaudy Courts abide  There if my Foresight fail not thou shalt find  Some Noble  Brittain  to these Infants kind  ie view d him well then press'd him more to know  Good Man he cry'd thou hast a Sceam of Woe  Inquire no more but where I bid thee go  His Words Emphatick struck an awe Divine  Both Priest and Prophet in his Vizage shine  Angiers  unknown to  London  takes his Way  Resolv'd the Holy Father's Voice t' obey  Wheree'er he goes there's no avoiding Fate  He to his Sufferings finds no early Date  The publick News his shameful Story tells  Explores his Crimes the  Dauphin  Wrath reveals  His Castle's raz'd his Lands Confiscate were  Too poor Amends for that offended Fair  A vast Reward whoe'er shall  Angiers  bring  Alive or Dead to the Revengeful King  His Race to endless Exile they condemn  And Death to those who shou'd these Laws contemn  I'd sing my Muse his Woes in such a Strain  That no sad reader might from Tears retrain  Sure all the generous Worl  must weep to see  Exalted Virtue in such Misery  Who can expres  his Fears and anxious Care  Enough to raise Distraction and Dispair  When he looks back upon his prosprous Days  The pleasant Paths and the delightful Ways  His Youth had trod it racks his thoughtful Brain  His Lot of Grief he scarcely can sustain  But Piety forbids that he should Heav'n arraign  He knows the only Way to vanquish there  Is Patience Faith unmov'd and servent Pray'r  So to the Temple flies that Ancient Pile  Which long had grac'd the City and the Isle  St  Paul  's for stately Pillars so renown'd  With all the Beauties of the Artist croun'd  There he repairs and takes his Children too  In hopes their Innocence may Mercy woo  Stretch'd on the Pave  ent wretched  Angiers  lay  And kneeling Infants early taught to pray  Devotion done a lovely  Brittish  Dame  With her Attendants from the Temple came  The Lord High Marshal's Wife of brightest Fame  She stop'd and not disdain'd to turn her Eye  Towards him who bore such Marks of Misery  She said my Friend from whence and what art thou  Why hangs that Cloud of Sorrow on thy Brow  This little Pair with Beams of Beauty shine  I cannot think thee poor if these are thine  Yet speak declare what is thy Cause of Grief  Perhaps by me kind Heav'n designs Relief  Oh wondrous Condescention  Angiers  cry'd  The truly Great are always free from Pride  Madam I Native am of neighbouring  Gaul  My Parents honest tho' my Portion small  'Twas my hard Fate Superi  s to offend  Whose Wrath no Modera  n knew nor end  And I was plac'd too humble to contend  I from my peaceful Dwelling straight was hurl'd  And bid to wander o'er an unknown World  Nor wou'd they stop their cruel Vengeance here  But sorc'd these Babes my Punishment to share  Too weak alass such mighty Ills to bear  She heard and Pity fill'd her Mind  The too long cruel Pow'rs now made her kind  With soft Compassion and a gracious Look  To listening  Angiers  thus the Lady spoke  If thou wilt give thy Daughter to my Care  Her Breeding and her Fortune shall be Fair  In Virtues Rules we will instruct her Youth  With Love of Modesty and Sacred Truth  Speak hen if to my Words thou dost agree  Inform her Name and leave the Child with me  First up to Heaven his watry Eyes he rear'd  And thank'd the Pow'rs who thus his Pray'rs had heard  Then to her  Oh thou bright Pattern of thy charming Sex  Bless'd be thy Days may no disquiets vex  Thy peaceful Mind nor lengthen'd Years perplex  But all thy Joys uninterrupted be  Thy Life one Scene of bless'd Prosperity  Florella  is the Name o'th' wretched Child  O may she Virtuous prove her Temper mild  With a kind Eye may you her Actions view  For you are Parents now and Mistress too  With that he turn'd and bursted out a Tear  The Infants parting Look he cou'd not bear  The courteous Dame to him a Present gave  And the poor Babe to an attending Slave  In ancient Times thus did they merit Praise  By Noble Acts their Name and Country raise  Few wanton Dames no broken Nuptial Bed  The Wretched they reliev'd the Poor they sed  In Deeds like this dwelt their Renown of Old  No Pride no Falshood no curs'd Love of Gold  But Glory reign'd in every  Brittains  Soul  No lurking Vice their Greatness durst controul  Angiers  return'd still sad his Heart still griev'd  To him the Child is lost tho' thus reliev'd  And as he measur'd out his pencive Way  He met the Bard with whom he cross'd the Sea  He hail'd him thus lift up thy Eyes from Earth  No sulien Star o'errul'd thy Childrens Birth  Thy Daughter now has reach'd the happy Shore  Destructive Fate has lost its pois'nous Pow'r  Her Innocence the Planets hurt no more  Thy Son good Fortune shall attend his Bloom  And a long Train of Blessings press to come  Only thou many tedious Years must wait  E'er thou shalt conquer thy malignant Fate  On me be all their hateful Influence shed  Showr all their Wrath on this poor destin'd Head  The Sufferer cry'd I'll bear it in their Stead  And if the rowling Torrent they withstand  I'll kneel and bless the persecuting Hand  Instruct me Sir how I this Youth may save  From threat'ning Ills which oft the Brave  For I shall soon press to the peaceful Grave  There undisturb'd may find that sweet Repose  So long deny'd by my too cruel Foes  Instruct your Son in his uncertain Wa  For Truth Divine shines forth in all you say  Then thus the Bard  Amidst the  Western  Mountains where of old  Such warlike Deeds of  Brittains  Chiefs are told  Where  Merlin  did his mighty Art expose  From whence his Wonders and his Fame arose  The Lord high President keeps there his Court  And fondly seeks the Strangers kind Resort  The Youths are there bred up to Feats of Arms  Thy lovely Son has all those manly Charms  That will attract his Eyes his Fancy move  And fix him to his Soul with Bonds of Love  Farewel for I shall ne'er behold thee more  My Tempest beaten Age comes near the Shore  Where wearied out I lay me down to rest  When Thought and Care no more shall load my Breast  Nor vainer Objects my freed Soul molest  But upward mount thro' yon bright Realms and see  All the great Maze of vast Eternity  The wond'rous Contemplation Silence brought  And he seem'd lost in Energy of Thought  Then lift his Eyes and blest the believing Pair  But tho' intreated would no more declare  He deem'd the Council Sacred and from thence  Doth his long weary Pilgrimage commence  Oft Scraggy Rocks and lofty Mounts they meet  Where rising Ground resists their willing Feet  Then reach'd those  Brittains  so renown'd of old  Of whom such famous Actions have been told  There as the Prophet said the lovely Boy  The Last the dearest Hope of  Angiers  joy  At the first sight the President approv'd  Made him his Care and soon he grew belov'd  Soon  Angiers  saw his happy Son design'd  The Darling of that Court and humane Kind  This was an Age when the Renown'd and Great  Made Wealth but serve them to assist the State  When bountious Nature had the GroundWork laid  Their forming Hand the worthy Heroe made  Like his own Children  Angiers  Son was train'd  And from his Patron's Bounty Arms and Arts he gain'd  In this was  Brittains  Glory and her Boast  From Discipline like this they rais'd a Host  Then no industrious Youth neglected lay  But Merit to Preferment led the Way  Lewis  d  pos'd as might advance his Worth  Was call'd  Perotto  to conceal his Birth  The  Dauphiness  became the Queen of  France  Her Pride and Rage do with her Pow'r advance  New Proclamations all around she sends  Disgraces those who had been  Angiers  Friends  He fears a stricter Search will now be made  Nor stays he least his Children be betray'd  But hasts to find a more secure Retreat  From Womans Rage that's lasting as 'tis great  Distress'd he quits Fair  Albions  court'ous Shore  But leaves behind his All his valu'd Store  For whom he often does the Heavens implore  He with Regret now leaves the lucky Strand  Looks back and Sighs as on his native Land  Extreamest Griefs his suffering Soul o'erflow  And every Breath declares incessent Woe  Then he reflects on his malicious Foe  Inhumane Queen ah Whether must I fly  Is there no way to scape thée but to die  Yes I wou'd die throw off these servil Chains  Did not our Priests pronounce eternal  ains  To those who wearied out with Life's Disease  Shall dare to cure themselves e'er Nature please  Fond Fatal Princess couldst thou see me now  Nor Love nor Rage wou'd discompose thy Brow  Thus Lean and Pail secure from being known  I should move Pity for a Wretch undone  And now my Royal Friend the  Dauphin  Reigns  His Subjects in their Native Right maintains  And Valour Justice Mercy grace the Throne  No injur'd Wretch makes his impatient Moan  But all the  Gallick  World the Face of joy puts on  'Tis only I that am debard of Bliss  Nor can find Rest without destroying His  Then let me ne'er accuse th' Imperial Dame  But suffer still the Punishment and Shame  He who had once a Nation at Command  Now seeks a Master in  Hibernia  's Land  It was his Fate a haughty Lord to find  Fierce and severe nor cou'd he bend his Mind  And he who in his mild and gentle Sway  His Servants made thro' Love not Fear o bey  No Slaves to pride in plenty and in ease  They liv'd content for 'twas no Task to please  Yet their Good Master's diligent in vain  Faultless is chid nor dares he to complain  Not  Hebrew Job  at length to Ills inur'd  So much or half so patiently indur'd  But now my weary'd Muse his Woes sorsake  Begin another Scene and turn the Prospect back  O'er pass the rowling Years of flying Time  And shew  Florella  in her Beauties Prime  Divinely Fair as the First  Eden  Maid  E'er she for Knowledge Innocence betray'd  When in her Eyes sate smiling every Grace  And the immortal Bloom was on her Face  And bright unfully'd Glories new Creation grace  Only one Son preserv'd the Marshal's Line  Whose Form was lovely and his Soul Divine  His Tour thro'  France  and  Italy  had been  And  Europes  World the Travelling Youth had seen  Return'd improv'd by skilful Masters taught  With all their Language and their Learning fraught  Pleasing his Mean so Gay but truly Brave  Nor yet to Vice or Passion made a Slave  The Courts Delight for whom each Lady strove  And put on all her Charms to make him Love  Lord  Mandevil  was now the only Theam  Their daily Pleasure and their nightly Dream  Florella  at a Rural Mantion staid  Left to the Conduct of the lovely Maid  Content with what her Fortune did afford  The Virgin thought not of her New come Lord  The joyful Parents show'd their Darling round  And every Pleasure his Return had crown'd  Then leave the Town their Country Seat to view  And with Variety their Joys renew  Soon as arriv'd  Florella  Duty paid  But Heav'n How gaz'd the Youth when he beheld the Maid  In all the Realms that he had travell'd o'er  He thought he ne'er had Beauty seen before  He sigh'd and look'd and fasten'd there his Eyes  And scarcely cou'd he hide the vast Surprize  She saw him fix'd the doubtful Virgin fear'd  She had done some Fault so blushing disappear'd  As if the Sun had straight his Beams withdrawn  And left no gladsome Ray no twilight Dawn  So seem'd to him the Place dark and forlorn  When Fair  Florella  from his Sight was gone  Absent her lovely Form remain'd behind  Fix'd was her Image on his tender Mind  He soon inquir'd who the Virgin was  And smiling said she had a charming Face  Th' indulgent Mother whose delightful Aim  Was to please him from whom her Pleasures came  With graceful Air the whole Adventure tells  And to his list'ning Ears each Circumstance reveals  He Blush'd and Sigh'd at what she did relate  And cry'd 'tis sure some Mistery of Fate  Her looks do Awe and Admiration strike  Such Charms from Want not Courts can show the like  Sure Heaven mistook and with a hasty Hand  Form'd her a Slave when it design'd Command  The Talk was chang'd but still his thinking Soul  Was with the glorious bright Idea full  He strugled hard nor yeilded to the Snare  But often cry'd she is not sure so Fair  Besides her Birth is mean not worth my Care  Urg'd by Desire a second Sight he sought  As if he wou'd correct his former Thought  Thus treacherous Love draws the Unwary on  The more they gaze the more they are undone  The pointed Rays had fill'd his Youthful Breast  Th' amourous Fire his daring Soul possest  And quickly grew too great to be supprest  The Brave the soonest are to Love inclin'd  And Love delights to sooth a generous Mind  In vain the Youth with fated Passion strove  For ev'ry Breast must yield to pow'rful Love  The Sons of Art no Recipee have found  In all their Store to heal this pleasing Wound  Had there in Herbs or Plants a Balm been known  The God of Physick sure had cur'd his own  He pines and sickens now with Loves excess  His Sighs and Languishings his Pains confess  His wonted Sports grew tastless to his Soul  Triumphant Pashon all his Joys controul  He hates the Court shuns ev'ry charming Fair  They cannot please unless  Florella  's there  To some dark Grot or Melancholly Grove  The Youth retires and breathes his hapless Love  There vents his killing Griefs and there complains  And only tells the silent Trees his Pains  A little Distance from the Palace stood  A stately Shade of venerable Wood  Which full a Hundred Years the Seasons bore  And Rev'rend Trunks with Moss were cover'd o'er  Whose dusky Shade defi'd the Rays of Light  And spite of Noondaybeams seem Sacred still to Night  In this Retreat the Lovesick Heroe chose  To nurse his Flame and to indulge his Woes  Florella  too to solitude inclin'd  But her Amusement's of another kind  Various Theams delight her easie Breast  And no prevailing Thought disturbs her Rest  Pensive she walks to take the Evening Air  At her Approach the Greens fresh Verdure wear  For her Companion flowing  Horace  chose  And could her self harmonious Airs compose  Officious Love her wand'ring Steps betray'd  And brought th' dispairing Youth the lovely Maid  Stretch'd on the Earth beneath a Maple Shade  As rooted there poor  Mandevil  was laid  His absent Soul was waiting on his Fair  But Sense and Life return'd as she drew near  Straight with Convulsive Transports he was seiz'd  At the Surprize alarm'd disturb'd and pleas'd  The modest Maid blushing her Lord espy'd  Obeysance made and turn'd her Steps aside  But when he saw the Virgin haste away  Confus'd he rose and thus bespake her Stay  Dear Nymph you seem the Goddess of this Grove  Or what is more th' Immortal Queen of Love  Let that soft Form a tender Heart contain  With Pity hear a dying Youth complain  For mine are real Woes and real Pain  These Woods are Witness to my constant Flame  Each Tree thy Cypher bears tho' not thy Name  Least jealous Eyes the mighty Secret find  And to my Charmer grow from thence unkind  But when alone my Tongue nought else will sound  I reach the vaulted Skies and pierce the hallow Ground  To Eccho's Care I send  Florella  's Name  And kindly she reverberates the same  Oh do not look with such relentless Eyes  If you're unmov'd your faithful Lover dies  All Night on Beds of Down I restlessrave  On this cold Earth I measure out my Grave  'Tis you alone can help 'tis you alone can save  The Maid whose Soul was suited to her Birth  With noble Scorn rais'd her fair Eyes from Earth  Then with a Voice majestick and severe  Thus spoke and gave the Lovesick Youth Dispair  Because I to your Mother's bountious Hand  For Food and Raiment do indebted stand  You think perhaps you may the Slave command  But tho' my Lord my Niggard Star's deny'd  Me Wealth and Titles they have giv'n me Pride  If from my Wants your wanton Hopes you frame  Know I prize Honour and a virt'ous Name  My Heart's unconquer'd and my Soul unstain'd  A Fortitude by Heav'n it self maintain'd  Nor Force nor Flattery can my Mind subdue  Behold me then great and resolv'd like you  Surpriz'd at this the wretched Lover cry'd  If you're displeas'd I wish ere this I'd dy'd  In my unhappy Speech what have I said  T' offend my dear belov'd bewitching Maid  Beneath thy Feet let me for ever lye  Or by your just Commands condemn'd to die  If 'gainst your Honour I had least Design  My Thoughts tho' they are kind are chast as thine  When of my Love I make an Offering  With Flames less pure then pious Vessels bring  When in their Temple they sincerely pray  And bright Devotion at their Altars pay  May all my Days and Nights be dash'd with woe  Nor e'er the Blessing of Possession know  May no Selfjoys my longing Wishes Crown  But Curse me still with a remorsless Frown  Ne'er think I would destroy the Worship'd shrine  Or wrong that Honour which I Court for mine  'Tis  Hymens  Torch is my auspicious Guide  Directs my Love to seek you for my Bride  Blest with that Hope I bear the Pains of Life  I ask you not a Mistress but a Wife  Else on the Instant wou'd I quit this Breath  And seek my Peace in the cold Arms of Death  Oh twou'd o'erwhelm my Soul with Black Dispair  If after all my Service all my Care  I did not hope to gain my charming Fair  Florella  cease to think my Love a Crime  And let my Faith be try'd by that sure test of Time  Injoyn me any thing that may convince  Of my Flames Durance and its Innosence  The greatest Tortures I would undergo  If you'll except it and believe it so  She listen'd now more Calm and more Sedate  Yet seem'd resolv'd as the Decrees of Fate  Then thus reply'd Such Virtue sure has Charms  But I am plac'd Inferiour to your Arms  Such Honours might the most Ambitious move  Who wou'd not prize the Treasure of your Love  But I'm unworthy your exalted State  And must except a more convenient Fate  Let not ignoble Fires your Youth mislead  With equal Fortune grace your Nuptial Bed  A Father will direct you in your Choice  There's no true Joys without the Parent's Voice  Therefore no longer feed this fond Desire  But here in silence let your Flames expire  And that from Guilt  Florella  may remain  That no ungrateful Act her Duty stain  Thus in the Face of Heav'n firmly swear  Your ill plac'd Passion I no more will hear  Except your Father's free Consent you gain  And Reason tells you that Attempt is vain  For he is cold in his declining Years  A dow'rless Wife's the greatest Ill he fears  Old Men are always fond of darling Gold  Still strive to grasp the Earth they cannot hold  Amongst the Great some wealthy Fair adore  Consult with Duty urge this Suit no more  Then with redoubled haste she flies away  He call'd in vain she wou  d no Answer stay  What Pen can paint the Sinner in Dispair  When Heav'n regardless will not hear his Pray'r  Terrors like those the hopeless Youth opprest  And fill'd the tortur'd Mansion of his Breast  Now he submits to Healthdestroying Grief  Bends down beneath he load nor seeks Relief  A deadly Pale his youthful Cheeks o'er spread  Continual Sighs have chas'd from thence the Red  His langui'd Eyes the chearful Light refuse  And in pale Fits their former lustre lose  Scarce will this wanton Age my Tale Believe  A Constant Youth their Vice wou'd ne'er forgive  Now Love is grown the Universal Sport  The Men design to leave e'er they begin to Court  Fickle their Nature's roving their Desire  In Various Heats there is no real Fire  Of old to one the Passion was Confin'd  They'd wait an Age to make the Fair one Kind  Changing's the Mode a Lover is a Fool  And to be very Faithful's to be very Dull  But to return to our kind  aithful Youth  And all the Wonders of  is Love and Truth  The Mother does with careful Eyes Survey  His Griefs and finds a sencible Decay  She trys with all delights his Soul to Chear  And when he Sighs crys out What ails my Dear  In vain her fondness the inquiry Frames  Guesses in vain a Thousand things she Names  Fruitless her Aid he still the wrack indures  Beneath the Moon but one  Elixer  cures  That deny'd all other helps are vain  He only with his Life can end his Pain  A languid Sickness makes his Youth a Prey  And Canker like eats the fine form a way  Apollo  's Sons are brib'd to use their Art  To save this Darling of the Mother's Heart  Their Cordial Juilps they apply in vain  They cannot Cool the Heat nor swage the Pain  Who can the Sighs the piercing Woe express  The Fears which his sad Parents Souls Distress  His Noble Father cry's his hopes are gone  His Name is lost his Heir his only Son  But his great Courage helps his Grief to Bear  The Lady seems distracted with her Care  Sorrow no sleep no balmy peace allows  And Heav'n she wearies with Incessant Vows  No Chearful Guest the wonted Mirth Maintains  But through the House a solemn Sadness Reigns  Florella  too who did these Woes Create  In Secret Mourns the Youths unhappy Fate  Blames the Cross Star that had to Love inclin'd  And made her cause the ills she ne'er design'd  Now at a stand are all the learned Tribe  They find it vain to Visit or Prescribe  The active Spirits weary of  eir Course  And drooping Life appears  tain'd by Force  His Servants all are dr  n'd in black Dispair  He only lost in Thought seems void of Fear  Reserv'd and cold to his officious Friends  He chides their Care their Diligence offends  When in her turn the Fair  Florella  came  The lovely source of this consuming Flame  He rear'd his dying Eyes and faintly said  Come near thou too too lovely Charming Maid  Now see how pale and languishing I lye  And still remember 'tis for you I dye  Death cold as your disdain comes o'er my Bloom  And ah sweet Nimph in Ages yet to come  As none in Beauty e'er can rival Thee  So none in Constancy shall equal me  Oh cruel Fair hereafter prove so Just  When I am lost forgotten in the Dust  To all the list'ning Swains my Story tell  Proclaim how much I  ov'd how early Fell  No other way I'd Court a lasting Fame  But as Loves Victim Eternize my Name  Yes Goddess the bright tract I have in View  Is that the World may say I dy'd for you  At this the Tears fell from her Conquering Eyes  And Sighs uncall'd from her fair Bosom Rise  The fainting Youth beheld the blushing Maid  And to his trembling Lips her hand convey'd  Enough my first my everlasting Dear  I dye content since I am worth a Tear  He said no more The approaching Friends might spair  Their useless aid for all the help was there  Amongst  Apollo's  Sons that crouded there  One to his Skill added peculiar Care  Resolves if Art will do't to save th' important Heir  Upon his Life he saw their  opes Depend  Nor unconcern'd hea  ev'ry Mourning Friend  Tho' some unmov'd can see the Parents Cry  Lamenting Wife or Friend stand sighing by  And gravely Answer  Man was Born to dye  When they perhaps have hasten'd Natures Date  And lay their own Mistake on guiltless Fate  But this with utmost care consulted Health  Like Generous  Garth  aim'd not alone at wealth  The Mean the Great his equal influence find  As sent by Heav'n to heal and bless Mankind  In him the Graces with the Arts combin'd  Like Poetry and Wealth but seldom Joyn'd  Yet here they Triumph all while he with Ease  Can Charm Relieve and Conquer a Disease  A Stranger to the New Phantastick way  Which dresses first and bids the Dying stay  He weigh'd each C rcumstance e'er gave his Vote  Took not the common way and kill'd by Rote  And by his nice Observances could find  The Body strugling with a tortur'd Mind  Healthful reluctant to th' imperial Sway  Contending still unwilling to obey  No  ctive Feaver lodg'd within his Blood  The sullen Soul deny'd the Body Food  And Sighs and Sorrow robb'd his Eyes of Rest  He sooths the Griefs which his sad mind opprest  Seeing him thus resolvd the ill t' Indure  And that he neither strove nor wish'd a Cure  The only care must be to search the Wound  There's no Receit has pow'r till that be found  He waits and watches the slow passing Sand  Tho' bid retire he minds not the Command  But still observes and grasps his feeble Hand  The Pulse was low as at th'  bb of Life  And weaken'd Nature  rce maintain'd the strife  When fair  Florella  to the Chamber came  Sent by his Mother that dispairing Dame  Straight the Male Ministers fetch nimble Strokes  And fresh Vermillion dy'd his Languid Looks  New strength new Vigour now his Eyes inspir'd  And glowing Cheeks with conscious Blushes fir'd  Relaps'd again soon as the Nymph Retir'd  The Wise Physitian this with Judgment weigh'd  He found the Youth was dying for the Maid  H e smiling rose and hasten'd to depart  And murmur'd to himself How Vain's our Art  We have no Medicine for a Lovesick Heart  He left the Room th inquiring Mother flys  To ask what hopes examines first his Eyes  Longing the truth to know yet truth she sears  Her trembling Voice is choak'd with rising Tears  Says he I long have view'd your deep Concern  And studi'd much your Sons Disease to learn  What led his Youth tow'rds an untimely Grave  And why my Drugs now lose their pow'r to save  In vain my utmost Art and Care I use  My Medicines all their healing power Lose  And the sick Youth does all releif refuse  At this amaz'd at length I truly Guest  Some Pain hid in the Closet of his Breast  There like destructive Fire in secret Mines  Consum'd his strength and baffl'd our Designs  The impatient Mother interrupted now  Surpriz'd she cry'd Can there be ought below  My Darling Son eager as Li  Requires  And wait not I too Crow  his fond Desires  'Tis Love he then re  d has rack'd him long  Love that delightful Torture of the Young  The Worlds great Lord subduer of the strong  The subtle Fire has pierc'd his aking Heart  And drinks his Vital Blood with ceasless Smart  His L  e's a Prey to the All powerful Flame  Unless he's cur'd from whence the Torment came  And is there then she haughtily reply'd  A Dame too great to be Lord  Mand'vils  Bride  Why pines my Son upon the Wrack of Love  When to be his each charming Nymph has strove  Name but the Fair who bears such conquering Eyes  Be sure my Lord High Marshal gains the Prize  How great soe'er her Noble Parents be  My Son can boast Descent with any she  The Blood that fills his Veins from either Source  Has a glorious Spring and untaunted Course  Titles and flowing Wealth his Name adorn  What cruel Nymph can pay him back with Scorn  Then the good Man whose Speeches only tend  To calm her Wrath and to preserve his Friend  Went on  If thus he'ad place'd his Love why shou'd he mourn  Or fear your kind Consent or her Return  But if forgot the Honours of his Race  He doats upon a beauteous Form and Face  Of Birth unknown tho' most divinely Fair  Whose utmost Glory is to be your Care  His Reason by his conqu'  g Love betray'd  And the sad Choice is  ath or that bright Maid  I need not now pr  ounce her well known Name  There is but one can kindle such a Flame  The Mother said What Ills must I indure  E'er my Stern Lord will yield to such a Cure  For this Misfortune he will me upbrai'd  Because I succor'd first the tender Maid  Vertue and Grace  Florella  does possess  My cruel Lord builds there no Happiness  Howe'er my utmost Tears and Prayers I'll try  'Tis better far to see him hers than dye  This spoke she hast's to find her Mourning Lord  In th' softest Phrase her Language cou'd afford  With moving Tears th' unhappy Tale relates  Oft blames her Son but more the cruel Fates  That thus ordain'd to rob their Souls of Rest  To lose the Youth by whom their Age was blest  Or give Consent she sigh'd that Ill's the least  Her soothing Softness cou'd not stop his Rage  Nor gentle Showers his Mad Fury swage  From his fierce Eyes the fiery Tempest came  Tumultuous Passion set him in a Flame  Let him then dye he cry'd e'er thus disgrace his Name  Oh barb'rous Sound Oh most unnatural Breath  She said To doom an only Son to Death  When first my Lord to me your Vows you paid  How oft you wish'd me born some humble Maid  That you might greatly prove your generous Fire  And griev'd your Fortunes cou'd not raise me higher  Had I been so you the same Risque had run  Then oh Forgive your too too Amourous Son  Yet all her pleading Agonies were vain  Her unperswasive Griefs cou'd only gain  That she might sooth her Son in his destructive Pain  That she with Hopes might lull his Cares a Sleep  Make Promises which he ne'er meant to keep  With this dear Cordial to the Youth she flies  Sits down and views him with the kindest Eyes  He Sigh'd and Begg'd she would his Faults forgive  And cry'd don't ask your wretched Child to live  Nor torture thus my Soul to see you Grieve  Your Blessing on your hapless Son bestow  Excuse the Debt I to your Goodness owe  'Tis a vast Summ which I can never pay  Yet I will rather dye than disobey  Weeping the Lady spoke  Oh thankless Child oh most ungrateful Boy  Too well thou know'st thou art alone my Joy  Thy Death will my Remains of Life destroy  Therefore no more of thy false Duty boast  When you indulge the Ill by which my Peace is lost  Since after Days and Nights of wracking Pain  Scarcely to be endur'd or thought again  Since the First happy Hour the gladsome Morn  When the wish'd News went round a Son was Born  I have indulg'd thee ev'ry anxious Year  No Mother e'er such Tenderness did bear  Why dost thou then distract me with Dispair  Upon my Love and Pain thou ne'er look'st back  Nor the successive Cares which I did take  So forward still the eager Streams are born  And to the Nursing Fountain rarely turn  He only groan'd here let my Life have end  Too long I've liv'd such Goodness to offend  She cou'd not bear the Grief she saw him feel  Fear'd to increase the Pangs she meant to heal  Then mildly with a softer Air began  And kindly cheer'd her poor dejected Son  Thy Fathers Hopes and mine are built in thee  His Pride thou art and every Wish to me  Yet cautious Youth in this you are to blame  You do not prize aright a Mothers Name  But hide from me your very best of Friends  The secret Woe on which your Life depends  Whilst your Physitian the true Cause displays  And saith 'tis inward Grief your Youth decays  Officious Fool the pensive Son reply'd  His nauseous Draughts he longer shou'd have try'd  Not the dear Secret of my Soul impart  And thereby show the Weakness of his Art  Oh  Mandevill  his Mother mildly said  Confess the Truth I will no more upbraid  For now his Care thy wishes have betray'd  Thy healthful Bloom let Grief no more devour  But seek my Aid and trust anothers Power  What silent still Will nought your Spirits chear  Go quickly one and call  Florella  here  Look up my Son and now believe me kind  I've brought the Balm for thy distemper'd Mind  Your Life in Ballance we this Choice prefer  Your only Task's to live and conquer her  Too much transported at this Change of Fate  He cry'd Your proffer'd Kindness is too late  The mighty Tides of Joy come on too fast  And weaken'd Life is gone too far to last  A dreadful Sound adds Terrour to their Fears  And fills the Room with piercing Shrieks and Tears  The Mother from the Pillow snatch'd her Son  And cry'd Help all or I am lost undone  Then on her Breast the Darling Youth she laid  And bid  Florella  bring her useful Aid  He strait reviv'd at Touches of the Maid  Then Conscious what transporting Joy had done  He blush'd at what Extravagance he'd shewn  And she as if the Fault had been her own  This was his Crisis this the lucky Hour  And Death and Sickness quit malignant Pow'r  Now wing'd with Joy the happy Minutes flew  He still beheld the Fair and still the Sigh was New  Soft Tales of Love he whisper'd in her Ear  Not so reserv'd butshe seem'd pleas'd to hear  And when he begg'd she wou'd his Fears remove  And bless him with that charming Sound I love  Her Tongue was silent but her Eyes proclaim  She lov'd the Youth and caught the infectious Flame  His Health return'd and every blooming Grace  Revives and sparkles in its wonted Place  With Transports in his Mein and Raptures in his Face  A new Respect was to  Florella  paid  All hail'd with Joy the beauteous happy Maid  Thro'out the Land was spread her wond'rous Fame  Each Sonnet rais'd new Trophies to her Name  With such a Grace as scarce can be believ'd  These flowing Honours the Fair Nymph receiv'd  The Courtly Youth now envy'd  Mand'vill  more  For this rich Prize than what his Titles bore  Paint now the Pleasures of the happy Pair  Whose Joys were Innocent and most Sincere  From Garden Grots to purling Streams they rove  Endless their Talk and all that Talk was Love  New Raptures still from Conversation grow  Ten Thousand Joys which only Lovers know  Such sancy'd Bliss her charming Presence brings  The blest transported Youth looks down on Kings  Implores that  Hymen  make his Joys secure  And tye that Knot which does for Life indure  Those were the Sun shine Days when  Cupid  play'd  And every Laughing Hour was joyful made  They dream'd not of the Black approaching Shade  Mankind when he injoys the Smiles of Fate  But vainly thinks to fix a prosperous State  And when ill Fortune does his Life attend  As vainly fears his Woes will never end  Alas 'tis foolish All our Life's a Dream  And every Season has its changing Scene  Fearless Supine and bless'd with sweet Repose  The Lovers were when unthought Storms arose  The Father to his Closet takes his Son  And with an Air severe his Speech begun  I'd know when you will quit this Sluggish Pace  When banish'd Honour reassumes its Place  And you maintain the Glory of your Race  Is not thy Fancy sated foolish Boy  Love is a Sweet design'd to please and cloy  Nor meant the nobler Faculty's t' employ  License I gave to the ignoble Fire  That thou might'st Glut thy insatiate Desire  And feed like some Illmanner'd eager Guest  'Till thou grew Sick and loath'd the Luscious Feast  Nay turn not Pale thou canst not change my Mind  Nor think I ever otherwise design'd  The impatient Son then eagerly reply'd  Under Love's Vail could you such Baseness hide  Compell'd by Duty I have heard too long  The Sacred Bus'ness of my Love you wrong  Florella  's Vertue is above your Thought  Nor wou'd the Jem with all your Wealth be bought  For the Fair Maid good Angels be her Guard  May her just Worth still meet a just Reward  Kind Providence preserve her Youth from Harm  Oh may shee ever live and live to Charm  His Father was inrag'd at this Reply  The Father said  And with a Stern tremendous Voice did cry  Audacious Boy And durst thou to my Face  Bless One born for thy Shame and my Disgrace  Go to the Grave and hide thy Abject Flame  Could'st hope I'd give to her a Daughters Name  Or vainly think I would thy Choice applaud  Tho' I did yield to a fond Mothers Fraud  I'd rather see thee and thy Sorc'ress dye  Than to the Marriage but in Thought comply  He calmly answer'd  Enough my Lord your furious Rage give o'er  Take your Sons Word you'll hear of this no more  With Looks compos'd he left the hateful Room  Nor cou'd his Father guess the Fate to come  No Image of Delight now fills his Mind  He ne'er can hope to make his Father kind  Deep strugling Griefs his doubtful Thoughts opprest  All Day no Dawn of Peace all Night no Rest  Tortur'd with Pains too great to be exprest  Disturb'd he walks revolving in his Breast  What Course he shou'd his wretched Footsteps stear  That most might shew his Love and his Dispair  Florella  fear'd him weary of his Flame  Nor gay nor pleas'd he to her  Toilet  came  No tuneful Airs her gentle Slumbers break  No Songs Salute her e'er she's well awake  And sweet Melodious Notes compos'd for her dear Sake  Nor one soft  Billet Deaux  so kind does prove  To whisper the Dear Tale of Truth and Love  If she approach he hangs his pensive Head  His Looks strait change from Pale to glowing Red  He Sighs as if around Destruction fell  And his full Eyes a fatal Story tell  These boding Symptoms fright the Charming Fair  Who finds when Love does faithful Breasts insnare  They're wrack'd with Jealous Fears and every tender Care  Retir'd alone she softly does complain  And wishes for her former Peace in vain  Reflects upon her Hours of downy Rest  Before inchanting Love that cruel Guest  Usurp'd with Tyrant Pow'r her milder Breast  Oh happy Days she said from Passion free  When all was Peace and calm Felicity  If eager Joy I neither wish'd nor knew  I liv'd without the Pain and Pleasure too  Oh happy State of Cold Indifference  Bless'd in that seeming Want of nicer Sense  Whom nothing pleases nothing gives Offence  No fierce Pursuit their thoughtless Minds employ  They feel no Sorrow as they taste no Joy  In Bounds the  Stagnate  Waters sullenlye  No Tempest raises them like Mountains high  Whilst Curling Waves form'd by the rapid Stream  Can never rest nor ever be Serene  Oh friendless Maid If he Unkind shou'd prove  Or so Untrue but to dissemble Love  And I the publick Talk the publick Jest  Become of ev'ry Meeting ev'ry Feast  But hold There's something tells me I am Born  Above their Laughter and above their Scorn  Yes  Mand'vill  If thou disdain'st thy humble Victory  Know I can Triumph too and bravely dye  Thus her dispairing Fears her Hopes o'ercame  Thus she accus'd her Lord and curs'd the fatal Flame  Whilst Love alone possest Young  Mand'vills  Mind  To give the greatest Proof he now design'd  And quit the waiting Grandeur of his Birth  And with his Love forsake the Glories of the Earth  For since  Florella  is deny'd his Wife  He'll wed himself to a Monastick Life  And tho' within his own dear Native Land  Many Fair Abbyes do inviting stand  Gardens and Groves delightful to the Eye  As if they meant to sooth Austerity  The best of all the Realm the Priest's still chose  They look'd as if design'd for soft Repose  But we are to believe they watch and pray  And Tears and Pennance wear their Hoursaway  These he avoids least Pow'r his Will restrain  And force him from their Convent Home again  In  France  he means to find some lovely Cell  And there in solemn Silence ever dwell  Now all things for his Voyage he provides  But from his dearest Friends the Secret hides  The Marshal dayly Tables did ordain  The weary travelling Pilgrims to maintain  Who always found a welcome there refresht  With Hospitable Food the Gracious Donor blest  Like one of these his Son design'd to dress  And 'scape unknown amidst the thronging Press  Thus his Designs the wandering Scene had laid  And thus the hapless Youth himself betray'd  Not to his Love he wou'd his Thoughts reveal  Yet cou'd not part without a last Farewel  Tho' 'twas a pang that Life cou'd hardly Bear  For her to Health and Life he did Prefer  Nothing beneath the Sun he held so Dear  He to the Beautious Nymph's Apartment went  Pains in his Heart and Looks of Discontent  He found her Reading to divert her Mind  'Twas  Ariadne  's pray'rs breath'd to the Wind  When faithless  Theseus  left the Fair Behind  He took the Book and when he saw the Place  A burning Blush flew to his lovely Face  She forc'd a Smile and cry'd what find you there  That in your Cheeks such Signs of guilt appear  Said he Had  Theseus  been Compell'd to go  To purchase Fame and fight a distant Foe  And left the Nymph in some blest happy Place  Wou'd that and sigh'd not alter much the Case  If left the Maid reply'd  Tho' in a Palace where she bore Command  'Twou'd soon grow hateful as the barren Sand  Since there is no amends for perjur'd Love  No pleasures will the bitter Pain Remove  Heav'n it self takes cognisance of broken Vows  And its strict Justice there no Mercy shows  Whither oh whither do thy Speeches lead  With dying Eyes the tortur'd  Mand'vil  said  Dost thou unjustly think thou art betray'd  Me my  Florella  Me dost thou accuse  Or tax with perjur'd Love or broken Vows  Do not my suff'rings dwell upon thy Mind  Oh thou too killing Fair And too unkind  Know that in all the tales of Love thou'st found  No Heart with greater truth was ever crown'd  My Thoughts have still been fix'd my Eyes ne'er straid  Since first Loves mighty Laws my Soul obey'd  And if my adverse Stars such woe Ordains  That I am still Condemn'd to endless Pains  If I am doom'd to lose what I hold dear  A Punishment which Nature cannot Bear  Add not my Fair to the too Cruel weight  But think it is the hard necessity of Fate  Ah little little of my Pangs you know  Nor kindly guess the wracks I under go  The rending Grief that tears my lab'ring Heart  When I with you and all my Joys must Part  Such woes as these fond nursing Mothers Feel  To see their Infants on the Soldiers steel  Such piercing Pain when we behold from far  The Vessel sink where all our Treasures are  Yet these sad Woes compar'd to mine are small  A parting Lovers grief exceeds them all  Must we then part she said Oh most unkind  And for what wretched place am I design'd  Friendless forsaken must I wander now  Or to some new imperious Mistress Bow  Ye unauspicious Stars that rul'd my Birth  Why was I form'd Why did I crow'd the Earth  When no Provision for my Life was made  And not one place my own to rest my Head  Let not such Thoughts affright thy tender Mind  Here thou shalt stay my Mother will be kind  That Parent for the Other does attone  She mild as Doves he hard as petred Stone  My Charmer she thy Life will easie make  And love  Florella  for her  Mand'vils  sake  She answer'd  Why such disjointed Thoughts do you express  You'll leave me yet talk of Happiness  Ruin thee surely my Ruin is design'd by Fate  And mustLove more destructive prove than Hate  Why my Calm Virgin Hours did you molest  Flatter me with possession of your Breast  Make me exchange my Peace for this unrest  If still he cry'd I do not love thee More  Than greedy Misers Gold or Monarchs Pow'r  Than sick Men Ease the happy Lifes Increase  Towns Beseig'd Relief or pious Matrons Peace  If thou art not my Joy my Life my Health  Priz'd like my Soul my only valu'd Wealth  Then send just Heaven upon my perjur'd Head  Ten Thousand Plagues and strike me with 'em Dead  But oh my Fair my Hope my only Wish  A Father stands 'twixt me and happiness  Deceiv'd in his dissembl'd false Consent  Whose specious words disguis'd a foul intent  In Rage he bid me quench my faithful flame  In Terms so vile my Soul abhors to Name  I oft have heard your cruel fatal Vow  Your Virtue no stol'n Marriage will allow  Therefore we must for ever everpart  Why do I live Why dost thou hold my Heart  Why does not Fate quick sure Destruction bring  Burst tortur'd Natures tyes and break each trembling String  Why when Life's tedious March was almost o'er  Was I brought back to suffer on the Shore  My cruel Father worse than Death destroys  Death is a Good when Life's bereft of Joys  Cease my lov'd Lord the fair  Florella  cry'd  Wou'd I had ne'er been born or born that Moment dy'd  All things to your kind Family I owe  And in return Curses alone bestow  I'll go where you shall ne'er behold me more  And with my Absence former Peace restore  Peace without thee the doting Youth reply'd  No Griefs will all my Days and Nights devide  Dispair and Sorrows all my restless Hours betide  Since from what my Soul desires I'm debarr'd  Forgive my earnest Suit nor think it hard  I beg you ne'er will yield to a new Lovers Charms  For I shou'd dye to see you in another's Arms  And as my first last Dear with lovely you  I bid the World and all your Sex adieu  So let me hope that Snowy Virgin Breast  Will never entertain another guest  If I have first your Heart to Love inclin'd  Oh still preserve me in your Chaster Mind  Will ye be so kind Can these Tears perswade  The fairest Nymph that ever Nature made  Can she for the poor hapless  Mand'vill  's sake  Resolve a lasting Leave of all Mankind to take  It looks like sullen Pride I must confess  That I should others barr of Happiness  But oh impute it to my Love's excess  Grant this my charming Dear my Hearts desire  The only Suit that I shall e'er require  Like Sorrows Image then he silent stood  And strove in vain to hide the falling Flood  Pale at her Feet the dying  Hero  fell  And let those Signs of Grief his inward Sorrows tell  Distress'd she rais'd him with her lovely Hand  And cry'd What wou'd my Lord his Slave command  Oh poor Return for all his wond'rous Love  That to no other Youth I kind should prove  Without Injunction I'd have made that Vow  Immortal Passion is your Merits due  No Maid can Love again after once loving you  No thou dear Idol of my conquer'd Soul  Thy Empire in my Breast no Pow'r shall e'er controul  Each tender Wish I'll dedicate to thee  For wheresoe'er confin'd still Thought is free  And mine shall ever Faithful ever Constant be  Oh For my sake each desperate Purpose shun  If thou art lost  Florella  is undone  With Patience let us our Misfortunes wait  And hope from Innocence a better Fate  He with glad Pleasure listened to the Fair  His Heart rejoyc'd to hear her Love and Care  Yet still resolves his Purpose to pursue  And meant this Visit for a last Adieu  He cou'd not take his longing Eyes away  But rooted stands and adds another Moment's stay  Another and another to the mighty Summ  Grudges the past and fears the rest to come  At length he clasp'd her in his faithful Arms  And said Thou Mistress of Eternal Charms  Remember  Mand'vill  thou soft lovely Maid  And let no Scandal on my Name be laid  My Love was pure from thought of Int'rest free  Virtue I sought found the rich Jem in thee  More worth than boundless Heaps of hoarded Gold  Or gawdy Titles which are bought and sold  A mighty Stock of Beauty Nature gave  Beauty that wou'd all humane Kind enslave  Judge then my Fair the Wrack such worth to leave  He said no more but forc'd himself away  With Sighs that did his Truth and Pangs betray  The Nymph distracted knew not what to guess  But found ill Fate on ev'ry side did press  Whilst secret Means for his Escape he made  And trusting none cou'd be by none betray'd  His Pilgrim Weed to all unknown he bought  And to his Chamber undiscover'd brought  And sends his Page on Errands several ways  That must detain tke Youth the space of many Days  Then leaves the Key of his own private Chest  And saith when he returns therein his Will's exprest  So fitted for the Purpose when alone  His Robe throws off and the poor Weed puts on  With a false Beard and Hair he hides his Face  And 'mongst the Travelling Pilgrims takes his Place  With them he passes thro' the House unknown  Leaves the gay pompous Roof design'd his own  To search some dismal melancholly Cell  Some Caves where Sorrows self wou'd chuse to dwell  Oh mighty Love Behold look down and see  This glorious Victim sure is worthy Thee  And if o'er Mortals thou wou'dst still maintain  Dispotick Sway and undisputed Reign  This Story in thy Annals still preserve  From him let constant Lovers learn to serve  His Birthright left the Honours of his Name  A wond'rous Tale fit for the Book of Fame  Let sighing Virgins endless Praise rehearse  Crown him ye Poets with immortal Verse  Ye Shepherds and ye Nymphs new Songs ordain  He was indeed the Glory of the Plain  When a forsaken Fair laments her Friend  If her Complaints to Exclamations tend  Name but this faithful Youth and all her Wrath shall end  Mand'vill  thy Constancy thy Worth alone  Shall for the Falshood of thy Sex attone  When amorous Youths shall meet in Plains or Groves  And there repeat the Story of their Loves  Thy lasting Truth in all their Songs shall shine  Thy eager Love and Constancy Divine  And each shall wish his Fame may equal Thine  Mean time  Florella  's busie in her Mind  Some quick Expedient she resolves to find  Her  Mand'vill  of his dang'rous Love to cure  Tho' She her hapless Self the Pain indure  Concludes to hide her in a living Tomb  Forsake the World Religious straight become  Sympathy gave to each the same Design  Both meant to raise their Love to that Divine  And aim'd to show what mighty Flames cou'd do  For each had vow'd to bid the World adieu  Yet still they hid the secret working Thought  'Till the form'd Purpose to effect was brought  Mand'vill  succeeds in what he fears to own  And with the Holy Pilgrims flies unknown  Now in her Turn Nights Gloomy Shades invest  The Ruddy Glories of the shining West  And weaken'd Nature seeks Recruit by Rest  When round the Palace the Inquiries pass  Who saw their Absent Lord and where he was  Near his Appartment they express'd their Care  With dutious Love expect to find him there  He wants no Service from officious Hands  They wait in vain for his desir'd Commands  When Darkness came they cou'd no more forbear  To the fierce Marshal told their Cause of Fear  With furious Rage he to his Lodging Flies  No Locks nor Bars th' impetuous Way denies  But all's expos'd to his inquiring Eyes  Sad trembling Fears the Mother's Steps retar'd  Complains the cruel Pow'rs have no Regard  To Worth but hinders Mortals of their wish'd Reward  When enter'd soon their busy Search does find  Him gone his scatter'd Garments left behind  A thousand Fears they in their Fancy frame  And many Dangers which they dare not Name  In this Distress each medling Fool grows wise  The helpless still are readiest to advise  With flying Speed  Florella  's sent for there  Pale look'd the Virgin almost dead with Fear  To their Demands she could no Answer give  But that he seem'd to take an everlasting Leave  His Lady cry'd this did my Soul presage  See now th' Effects of your too cruel Rage  We're Childless left in our declining Age  Your boundless Wrath destroy'd a faithful Pair  And heaps on me the Terrours of Dispair  Cou'd this fair weeping Maid create Offence  Has she not Charms enough in Truth and Innocence  To match with so much Vertue no Disgrace  They to your Joy might have brought forth a Race  T' uphold the Honours of your Name and Place  But now your hoarded Wealth your Seats and Lands  Will fall to some ungrateful Stranger's hands  And I shall curse my Prudence and my Care  Compell'd with the Effects to bless some forreign Heir  Stung with Reproach and Loss the Marshal swore  If he'd return to oppose his Love no more  That his fix'd Flame shou'd be with Joys repaid  And he wou'd yield his Son to that Allcharming Maid  If with strict Search that Son can e'er be found  For which the Servants are dispatch'd around  He binds his Promise with a Solemn Vow  That the wish'd Marriage freely he'll allow  Nor by Reproach his Passion disapprove  But crown his Constancy with lasting Love  Thus does Affection bend the stubborn'st Mind  Pierc'd with the smart turns Pious and grows kind  Each Road they take and pry with eager Eyes  But miss their Lord unknowing his Diguise  They only find the Page and force him home  Examine oft where his lov'd Master's gone  The affrighted Boy the Truth of all reveals  His Lord's Commands and secret Letter tells  His Cabinet is in a Moment brought  And there with ease they find what they had sought  To FLORELLA this Inscribed  The LETTER  'E'er this my Dear will reach thy lovely Hand  'I shall have ever left my Native Land  'Cast out from thee no matter where Iroam  'The Tryal's o'er Iv'e suffer'd All at Home  'To rough unpolish'd Cells I now retire  'And leave behind fond Hope and fierce Desire  'Yet Love will there maintain a languid Flame  'Like Lamps in Tombs tho' useless burn the same  'Did my  Florella  now her Pilgrim view  'She'd own the Wonders mighty Love can do  'Wou'd say I in this Parting suffer'd more  'Than ever wretched Mortal did before  'Did she my Trembling and my Tortures see  'I'm sure she'd pity and remember me  Mand'vill  The Virgin faints as she the Letter read  Like Dewy Roses hangs her drooping Head  Their Search agen renew'd they take their Way  To all the Ports that lay along the Sea  And that their Message may his Flight prevent  Bless'd News they bring to give his Mind content  His Father's Letters full of kind Consent  His better Fate o'errul'd that working Sea  And for a Wind the waiting Pilgrims lay  Now the general Cry was All aboard  Just as the Men arriv'd and found their Lord  Rejoyc'd amaz'd and fill'd with glad Surprize  Delight and Wonder strugl'd in their Eyes  His were cast down asham'd of his Disguise  Great Minds are constant to their Purpose still  And take from Fate a Disappointment Ill  Resolv'd he held a Pon'yard to his Breast  And said my Friends I am not now in Jest  My Father's Will I own I shou'd obey  But Love o'er Duty has imperial Sway  You force my certain Death if you come on  I own my self a most Ungrateful Son  But quitting that belov'd illustrious Maid  With double Punishment my Faults are paid  Affrighted they the headstrong Passion wait  And scarce cou'd cool this most intemp'rate heat  At length they humbly did their Letters give  Begg'd he wou'd hear and be at Peace and live  He reads his Parents with a double Joy  His rising Fears his Raptures did destroy  'Till Fair  Florella  's Hand and Signet came  She fix'd his Hopes 'twas Sacred with her Name  And thus her Letter spoke her kind Concern  'Return my Dearest Faithful Lord return  'Give me not endless Cause your Loss to mourn  'Can you pretend you Love and yet prepare  'For your  Florella  worse than Death Dispair  'Oh most unkind Cou'd you for ever go  'And let not me your fatal Purpose know  'If with a Flame sincere your Heart does burn  'I Charge you by that Sacred Flame return  So Royal  Mandates  the last Hour arrive  When pitying Queens bid Malefactures live  With such vast Joy the Innocent and Brave  Receives the only Cordial that had Pow'r to save  Forgets the Penance that his Soul design'd  And with his Garb resumes a chearful Mind  By her Command his Speed outflies the Wind  A general Joy thro' all the House is spread  Welcome as if our Voice could raise some Darling Dead  His Father speedy Marr'age does Command  And joyns in his the Fair  Florella  's Hand  Yet there's a fix'd Regret he's forc'd to hide  So much the Marr'age mortifies his Pride  Not so the Mother that kind  Brittish  Dame  She likes the Maid and well approves the Flame  What's their Concern to the glad Lovers Bliss  All Day they Gaze and Talk and Vow and Kiss  'Till that dear joyful long desir'd Morn  That Day which  Mand'vill  thinks will Years adorn  Is come when charming Bridal Virgins wait  And jolly Youths throng to the Palace Gate  Then bright  Florella  lovely as the Rose  Ten Thousand Glory's in her Eyes disclose  By curious Art deck'd in the  Brittish  Pride  To wond'ring Crowds appear'd the fairest Bride  That e'er fam'd  Alhion  grac'd in all her Store  So bright a Nymph was never seen before  Then the Bridegroom gay as the Eastern Sun  Yet seem'd in haste and wish'd his Race were run  Challeng'd his shining Rival of the Day  And bid him hasten tow'rds the ebbing Sea  Paid all his Vows to Sacred Solemn Night  His Pray'rs the sober footed  Matron  do invite  And calls her dark'ning Gloom his Hearts delight  At length the happy joyful Day is past  And the dear welcome Shades are come at last  New Sports the longing Bridegroom's joy's retard  Farce and Dance which have but small regard  He hasts to the last Scene the gawdy Bed  With  Indian  odours Native Roses spread  Each busie Hand's employ'd to undress the Fair  No need of Sweets when young  Florella  's there  How many Fears the blushing Virgin awe  She knew not what she said nor whom she saw  Bless'd  Mand'vill  comes my Muse the Curtain draw  Leave now in perfect Bliss the happy Pair  And let  Perotto  next become thy Care  In all that Court he was the Youth alone  Whose Acts immortal Fame and endless Glory crown  In Sports or in great Exercise of War  Then all the rest he still exceeded far  His Mother's Beauty and his Father's Grace  Was stamp'd upon the lovely Hero's Face  Kind Fortune did his glorious Youth befriend  And all he undertakes Success does still attend  Judgment and piercing Wit which all approve  And various Charms to gain an Universal Love  The President who did his Title Grace  Had bounteous Nature blest with numerous Race  All things in Court wear an auspiceous Face  And that Experience may his Arms advance  He's sent a Volentier to serve in  France  Such strange Adventures does Blind Fortune bring  Unknown he treads his Native Shore defends his King  But whilst expos'd he courts an early Name  And with Expence of Blood secures that darling Fame  At Home  A Pestelential Sickness rages round  Destructive Mists ascend thick Vapours from the Ground  Th' unwholsome Blasts does Man and Beasts confound  Perotto  heard their State and evil Case  And quickly flies to the infected Place  Rumour but half the Desolation spake  'Twas such a Scene as noblest Hearts might break  That Palace which he gawdy left and gay  Now Midnight Silence reign'd at Noon of Day  A Cause that did incessent Grief afford  Death had destroy'd his Patron and his Lord  And all his Sons with whom he had been bred  Even all the Heroick Youths were Dead  Cammilla  the only Daughter still surviv'd  And in the midst of this Destruction liv'd  So tender Plants do sometimes brave the Storm  When Oaks and Tow'rs are from their Basis torn  She liv'd indeed but shut from humane Eyes  For 'bove her Life she did her Father prize  That being near her dead and dying Race  She was confin'd in the infected Place  And she whose Form did all the World delight  Is shun'd like Death or some destructive Spright  'Till to the Place the bold  Perotto  came  He Lov'd and Danger but increas'd his Flame  Thro' all the Avenues eagerly he flies  Still complicated Horrour meets his Eyes  And noysome Steams from the unburied Dead arise  Here lifted hands in vain for help do call  The Servant at his Master's Feet does fall  In one promiscuous Heap lay Old and Young  The Rich the Fair the Healthful and the Strong  Then angry Heav'n sends the Destroyer forth  Who can express the Terrours of his Wrath  The Plague with rapid Force devouring Rage  Seems as 'twou'd clear this crowded busie Stage  Of all that thinking Stock of humane Kind  Infects the Body sinks the forming Mind  Dispair and Black Idea's fill the Soul  Such Thoughts as all Religion wou'd controul  All ties are broke the Fathers flies the Sons  The Mother from her bosom'd Infant runs  Dire Hate in each infected Breast presides  And new made Bridegrooms shun their charming Brides  Death's grown so common none will shed a Tear  Nature and Love are both o'ercome by Fear  Only  Perotto  he his Fair will save  Or else in worse than Charnels find a Grave  Amid'st these Ruins bright  Cammilla  fate  Expecting still her tender Parents Fate  Perotto  comes implores that she wou'd leave  That wretched Place and fly with him and live  At first she'd not believe her weeping Eyes  And view'd  Perotto  with a strange Surprize  Art thou come she said to this House of Death  Approach not least I infect thee with my Breath  Shun this contagious and destructive Air  I am a Prey to Sickness Sorrow and Dispair  With untaught Sighs the Lover made Reply  Consent with me your faithful Slave to fly  Or give me leave to stay with you and dye  Dread of these Horrours soon the Point does gain  And with those few that did alive remain  They quit the Castle for the open Plain  Perotto  skill'd in Bus'ness of the Wars  A Ten  for Fair  Cammilla  strait prepares  And tho' their little Troops infected round  He from their Sight nor Touch no Danger found  Whether Love with his All powerful Dart  And burning Flames secur'd his Manly Heart  Fill'd all and for Contagion left no Room  Or whether Fate's Decree deferr'd his Doom  With chearful Health the faithful Youth was blest  With Strength and ardent Pow'r to serve the rest  Bleak Winter now with nipping Frost draws near  Courted desir'd and hollow Winds that clear  The hot unwholsome and polluted Air  Thinly the peopl'd Towns appear agen  The ruin'd Clime begins to look Serene  The untill'd Land's again the Labourers Care  And Temples now resound with Praise and Pray'r  Nobles to long deserted Houses come  And straight invite the Brave  Perotto  home  For having learn'd his Honour Love and Truth  They Court  Cammilla  to espouse the Youth  And that he may not want deserving Grace  Adorn his Merit with her Father's Place  Cammilla  Pious Just and truly Good  His Worth and her Obligements understood  Besides the medling World might Tax her Fame  And fix some Blot on her unsulli'd Name  When she with him fled to preserve her Life  'Twou'd Stain her Honour not to be his Wife  'Tis done in Solemn Pomp the Knot is ty'd  The Great  Cammilla  is unknown  Perotto  's Bride  Oh  Angiers  Thus Providence makes up what thou did'st lose  No better Fortune if thy self had chose  That guiding Fate which does our Steps direct  We fall not by it but our own neglect  We tread forbidden Paths without a Guide  'Tis not Heav'ns Fault but our own selfish Pride  Thus Man is Curs'd with what we call Free will  In Errour lives and wondrous prone to Ill  Why were we made Why from our unsought Birth  Are the immortal Seeds condemn'd to Earth  Why do we Think and Judge above the Bruits  Yet gain no farther Knowledge by Disputes  Why endless Bliss and Torments do we frame  Yet cannot give the Joys nor Punishment a Name  Happy alone that thoughtless Mortal lives  Who feeds on Faith and as the Church believes  Who never wrong commits and whose calm Breast  No deep Inquiry makes to break his Rest  This Man my Muse pronounces truly blest  Ye undistiuguish'd Notions hence begon  Let's to our Story let our Tale go on  Thus  Angiers  Race are in due Honours plac'd  With plenteous Wealth and shining Glory grac'd  Now my Muse the Fathers woes depaint  The various Hardships of that suff'ring Saint  Who twenty Years remain'd in servile State  With Patience bore the rude Insults of Fate  Humble in Sorrow in Affliction Wise  Conform'd his Actions to that base Disguise  As on the lowly Flowr he Sleeping lay  Heav'n to his working Thought this Vision did display  His Room seem'd fill'd with Darling Light Divine  Immortal Rays with glorious Splendour shine  Scarce cou'd his humane Eyes the Brightness bear  The darting Beams shewn forth so radient clear  When in a Garment of unspotted White  Too heav'nly Fair for earthly Mortal Sight  Close by his side the Reverend Hermit stood  Who twice had taught him for his Childrens Good  And with a Voice whose Sweetness charm'd his Ear  Thus spake bid him his Words observe and hear  From the Eternal Realms of endless Light  Where there's no Shaddow of approaching Night  Where all with beatifick Joys are crown'd  Where Sin and Sorrow's never to be found  But Bliss and Praises take their tuneful Round  From thence by Gracious Providence I'm sent  To chear thee in thy Race of Punishment  To tell thee thy Reproach draws near an end  And pitying Heav'n will thy last Years befriend  Angiers  again to Courteous  Albion  hast  Good Fortune's welcome if it comes at last  Thy Daughter's there match'd equal to her Blood  Thy Son magnificently Great and truly Good  Then thou again shalt view thy Native Land  Again be rais'd i'th' State and fix'd in high Command  From Calumny and Guilt discover'd free  And after all my Son shall Share those Joys with me  Look up anticipate what shall hereafter be  He saw Ten Thousand Angels on the Wing  Straight heard the loud Immortal Praises sing  Beheld the Golden Lyres felt melting Strains  That struck his Soul and trembled thro' his Veins  The Extasie for Nature grew too strong  Nor cou'd he bear the mighty Vision long  But as he strugl'd hard and wou'd have spoke  The weaker Bands of flattering Sleep were broke  He wak'd and found it almost perfect Day  'Twas Darkness when compar'd to the bright Ray  Which late his Soul and wandring Eyes had seen  The glorious Transports of this heav'nly Dream  To doubt the Truth he deems a mortal Sin  Parts with his cruel Lord his Voyage does begin  Safely he cross'd the boist'rous watry Main  And now beholds the  Brittish  Clifts again  In Pilgrims Weed the Noble Earl was drest  Begs all his humble Food and where at Night to rest  To th' Marshal's House directs his weary Feet  The first sad Object his sad Eyes did meet  Was  Violante  led by her court'ous Lord  With all the Pomp such Greatness does afford  The gawdy Scene of Joy he scarce cou'd bear  To see his Child so wond'rous Great and Fair  Yet still no sign of Gladness he betrays  But humbly with his fellow Pilgrims stays  'Till summon'd by th' appointed Servants Call  They press and fill the hospitable Hall  Angiers  Distress his Servitude and Woe  Had turn'd his curling Locks as white as Snow  His Meagre Face with many a Wrincle plough'd  And Sun burn'd Skin no former Beauty show'd  The Pilgrims fed and Dinner tane away  Two lovely Infants were brought forth to play  Kind Heav'n had bless'd young  Mand'vill  's Marriage Joys  With two bright beauteous charming Boys  The Children straight to th' Pilgrim  Angiers  run  As if they knew the Root from whence they sprung  He kiss'd them Joy that Stranger to his Breast  At their lov'd Sight became once more his Guest  They walk with him and hang about his Knees  While he finds ways their childish Hearts to please  And when the Time is come for their Return  When they their little Studies must perform  Their Masters call and Servants ask in vain  They'll not the Pilgrim leave nor to their Books again  The Mother from within beheld this sight  And smil'd to see them in such high Delight  Bid them their Innocent Desires obey  And let them longer with the Pilgrim stay  Then the Stern Marshal and his noble Son  Walk'd cross the Court and thro' that spacious Room  With a proud Smile the scornful Marshal cry'd  There let 'em stay to Beggary they're ally'd  Too near by the ignoble Mother's side  When that Reproach poor suffering  Angiers  heard  The Tears run down his Cheeks and Snowy Beard  Young  Mand'vill  fum'd his inward Rage boil'd o'er  His Father only durst his Wife explore  Whom he with true Devotion does adore  Mand'vill  the unknown Pilgrim thus bespake  What Sorrow's thine Is't for the Childrens sake  Know then thou good old Man whose tender Heart  Is mov'd I feel than thee a greater smart  In the Reproach the little Babes are mine  All Virtue's in the Charming Mother shine  Of Birth unknown the Tale's too long to tell  Rais'd by my Love she wears her Honours well  No Pow'r nor Pomp o'ersways her steddy Mind  She's justly Great yet Affable and Kind  Forgive me Father unawares he said  That on this Subject I so long have staid  Florella  merits more than I can say  More faithful Love than my whole Life can pay  Angiers  reply'd Oh Noble Constant Youth  With Pleasure I have heard thy wond'rous Truth  The brightest Tale i'th' lasting Book of Fame  'Mongst Lovers ever Sacred be thy Name  Let Vir  ous Maids Garlands for thee prepare  Virtue was found thy most peculiar Care  The humble Maid was wholly in your Pow'r  Yet you sosook the loose Luxuriant Hour  And to make your amorous Wish compleat  Preserv'd your Passion Good so made it Great  No Band is softer than the Nuptial Tyes  Th Renegade that does the Form despise  M ets with ten Thousand Arrows as he flies  Charm'd with his Speech  Mana'vill  of Nature kind  Ask'd him from whence he was and where design'd  He said he was a Bark by Tempest hurl'd  And left a Stranger in this cruel World  Here be thy Harbour generous  Mand'vill  cry'd  Here thou shalt find no Frowns no Ebbing Tide  In thy Devotion quiet and serene  In Safety view thy past tempestuous Scene  Angiers  with Thanks reply'd if I partake  Thy Kindnesses still done for Virtue's sake  Accept what service feeble Age can pay thee back  Again the  Germans  'gainst the  French  prepare  And all is Hostile grown and open War  England  was then a Friend and dear ally  With her bold  Brittains  did their Troops supply  To head 'em  Mand'vill  and  Perotto  's chose  For their unquestion'd Merit none oppose  The next Delight that charm'd old  Angiers  Heart  He view'd his Son perform the great Commanders Part  Beheld him lead a Troop of Gallant Men  Whose sight brought former Glory back agen  When Young such Valiant Bands himself had lead  And been a Kingdom's and an Amry's Head  Now bow'd with Age unknown his Life he past  And seem'd to travel to his Grave in haste  Thus the two Brothers link'd in joynt Command  Knew not that they were ty'd in a much stricter Band  Let's vail  Cammilla  and  Florella  's Fears  Their Vows their parting Sighs and flowing Tears  Together they are left each to condole  That by dividing Grief neither may bear the Whole  Mand'vill  design'd to leave the Pilgrim here  But the poor Count begg'd to attend him there  Resolves to view where he had been undone  Th' ungrateful Land that cast forth such a Son  The jolly Soldiers now are got aboard  And the auspicious Winds quick Passage do afford  Their Plumes and waving Banners they advance  And with their Succours bring new Joy to  France  Now let our Just Historick Tale remove  The Queen must give Account for lawless Love  To Alldevouring  Time  her Charms give Way  Her Looks not lovely now nor briskly Gay  No Fire her Eyes her Veins no amourous Flame  But in her Heart Remorse Repentance Shame  Confusion Sorrow a Melancholly Train  Perplex her Soul and keep her Mind in pain  Angiers  vile Wrongs stand Glaring in her View  That Thought does all her secret Steps pursue  The Hag that nightly loads her tortur'd Breast  And never lets her tast the Sweets of Balmy Rest  A ling'ring Sickness follows pining Grief  Nor can the Sons of Art bring wish'd Relief  With downcast Eyes they approach th' dying Fair  Their Solemn Looks discover their Dispair  Gashly the King of Terrours does appear  Black Guilt adds Horrour to tormenting Fear  She looks around and sees no Comfort nigh  Spight of Imperial Greatness she must dye  To bear the Shock she Summons former Pride  She's grown too weak all Aid is now deny'd  Then let us yield she sigh'd and faintly said  And sunk upon the Bosome of a faithful Maid  Fetch here the Council and the injur'd King  Than Death my Friends I have a sharper Sting  I cannot dye in Peace while 'tis conceal'd  And I must dye for Shame when 'tis reveal'd  The waiting Slaves straight her Commands obey  Eager the King to hear what she wou'd say  With weeping Eyes he view'd departing Life  And call'd her by the tender Names of Love and Wife  Oh Prince She cry'd behold  Cleora  lost  And sinking down a guilty guilty Ghost  Unless great  Angier  's Race you can restore  I'm wrack'd on Earth with Pangs and plunging into more  Forgive your Wife let Mountains hide her Shame  Mine was the Sin mine th' impetuous Flame  And curs'd  Cleora  only was to blame  In this Cabinet you'll find the Story writ  If 'tis possible my fatal Crimes forget  Angiers  to Honour straight and Grace retrieve  And Natures Faults let Heav'en and you forgive  This said  Nature asham'd her Soul to earth inclin'd  Broke the weak Tyes of her Majestick Mind  That it might mount to purer Regions unconfin'd  Reason and Sense from th' affrighted King is fled  To hear th' unsuspected Guilt and see her Dead  Reviv'd the Search of Truth his Soul pursues  And with Amazement he the Paper views  Where every secret Thought he saw confest  And every guilty Wish that fill'd her Breast  He groan'd to think how much he'd been deceiv'd  And said no beauteous Woman e'er shou'd be believ'd  Now to her Tomb's convey'd the unhappy Fair  But busie Fame will not be buried there  Fame seems to joyn with our invet'rate Foes  Spreads our bad Deeds and gathers as it goes  And with the Rumour Royal  Mandate  's come  To call the injur'd suff'ring  Angiers  home  Rewards whoever brings the Absent Lord  And all his Castles and his Lands restor'd  Angiers  cou'd scarce resolve to trust again  Th' uncertain World and faithless cruel Men  Hid in a lowly State a mean Retreat  He found some Plagues but none like being Great  Now with a gentle Lord his Age does rest  No Care nor Envy does his Hours molest  And Innocence and Peace possess his Breast  His Children want the Greatness of his Name  Nay he grows fond of the exalted Fame  And as his Sons revolving in a Tent  Discant on Change Death and this strange Event  Both commiserate the guiltless Heroe's Fate  Noblest Natures still are most compassionate  Attending  Angiers  heard and strait came forth  And with a Look that stamp'd his Words for Truth  Began  My Lords in Pity lend an Ear  They're bless'd who'll not disdain the Poor to hear  If you'll Admission to the King obtain  For my Endeavours wou'd alas prove vain  Of that unhappy  Angiers  I might tell  I've met him oft indeed I know him well  They said the Favour's lessen'd when with pain 'tis sought  My Friend thou sure shalt to the King be brought  To th' Royal Tent they strait their Steps direct  And having paid the King their due Respect  Thus  Mand'vill  spoke  This aged Man of my Domestick Train  Who begg'd with me to cross the  Brittish  Main  To your Majesty he sais he can relate  The History of your loft  Angiers  Fate  Let him speak hastily the King began  For much I long to hear of that great injur'd Man  As Noble  Angiers  spoke and form'd his Tale  In such pathetick Words as must prevail  The King observ'd with an intensive View  Then starting from his Seat cry'd  Angiers  it is you  Those graceful Looks and that dear faithful Voice  In which my Youth with Pleasure did rejoyce  Quick to my Arms my constant Wish restore  And Fate shall never never part us more  Who can express the Joy in every Face  When they beheld him kneel and saw the King embrace  The Courtier's Flock he's circled in the Crowd  Of those who strive to speak their Welcome loud  Soon to his wond'ring Son the Story's told  How in the  East  their Father they behold  In Silence they their inward Joys suppress  Blush they no sooner knew their Happiness  Mand'vill  sunk with Shame when Reflection brought  His Father's sharp Reproach to his revolving Thought  Angier  's Soul was to that Calmness grown  That he forgave the Ills design'd and those unknown  With Tears the worthy kneeling Heroe rais'd  And to the King their Deeds and Virtue prais'd  To make the Earls returning Joy compleat  A Victory they gain with Wealth and Honour great  They lead in Triumph the long suff'ring Lord  And he's to thrice his former Wealth restor'd  The News to  Violante  Fame conveys  And soon as that she's begg'd to cross the Seas  The Kings own Yatch attends on her Command  With all the Greatness of the  Gallick  Land  Florella  here sees Fortune's smoothest Brow  Great in her Birth as in her Marriage now  Of all her Ills wrong'd  Angiers  might bemoan  He the chief Notice took of this alone  That she was branded mean because unknown  To the Earl Marshal this said he declare  Let him not still dispise his charming Heir  Tell him the Blood the Female Side supplies  Does from as old and great a Fountain rise  The haughty Marshal does from her receive  The wond'rous News which they with Joy believe  They all congratulate then she takes her leave  The Bark is driven by auspicious Gales  And prosperous Winds fill all the swelling Sails  Safely she's landed in her Father's Arms  Adds to the Court with her Superiour Charms  Now Feasts and Joy throughout the Realm abound  Revels and Masks make up the circling Round  Thus they forget the Tempests they have past  And thus Heroick Virtue's crown'd at last  FINIS
