 A DEFENCE OF Sir  Fopling Flutter  A COMEDY Written by  Sir  GEORGE ETHERIDGE  In which DEFENCE is shewn That Sir  Fopling  that merry Knight was rightly compos'd by the Knight his Father to answer the Ends of  Comedy  and that he has been barbarously and scurrilously attack'd by the Knight his Brother in the th  Spectator  By which it appears That the latter Knight knows nothing of the Nature of COMEDY  LONDON  Printed for  T WARNER  at the  Black Boy  in  Paternoster Row  Price SixPence  THE PREFACE  _THE following Defence of the Comedy of Sir  Fopling Flutter  not only contains several Remarks upon Comedy in general Remarks that are equally necessary for the Writing it successfully and for the Judging of it surely but every Article of that Defence is a just Censure of a certain Comedy now in Rehearsal if I can  depend upon the Account which I have had of it from several who have read it or to whom it has been read And that the Account which I have had of it is very just I am apt to believe not only from the Judgment and Sincerity of the Persons from whom I had it but likewise from the scandalous Methods that are us'd to give it a false and a transitory Reputation  I have formerly made Mention of Poetical Mountebanks The Author of the Comedy now in Rehearsal has all the Marks of an Empiric of  Parnassus  His Play has trotted as far as  Edinburgh  Northward and as far as  Wales  Westward and has been read to more Persons than will be at the Representation of it or vouchsafe to read it when it is publish'd  Another certain Sign that a Man is an Empiric is when he gives high  Encomiums  to himself and his  Nostrums  and pretends at the same Time that those  Encomiums  are given by others Now Advertisements have been sent to the NewsPapers to this Effect That the Comedy now in Rehearsal is in the Opinion of excellent Judges the very best that ever came upon the  English  Stage Now no Body could send that Advertisement but the Author or one of his  Zany's  by his own Contrivance or at least Connivance No one could send such an Advertisement or give such a Judgment but a Fool or a Knave a Knave if he did it with a Design to impose on the World and a Fool if he did it in the Sincerity of his Heart For to declare with Judgment that a Play is the very best that ever came upon the  English  Stage requires vast Consideration profound Reflection and a long long Comparison And what Mortal  is qualify'd to pass such a Judgment upon a single momentary Reading He who sent those Advertisements then sent them with a Design to impose upon the World or is an arrant Ass But 'tis highly improbable that a Fool who knows nothing of the Matter should give himself the Trouble to send such an Advertisement or that any one else should do it but the Author or the Author's  Zany's  by his Subornation For whose Interest could it be but theirs to endeavour to impose upon the World But now if it shall appear by the following Treatise that the Author of the Dramatick Piece in Rehearsal knows nothing of the Nature of True Comedy then how foolishly arrogant are those insolent and impudent Advertisements These very Ways of Proceeding sufficiently declare the Author's Consciousness of his own Incapacity for a noble Genius will scorn such infamous Methods and will resolve to owe his Reputation to his Merit and not to tricking  Artifice These are some of the Methods which the present Managers of the  Stage  have us'd to ruine the  Dramas  and with it all other Human Learning which is in some Measure dependant on it For since Cabal and Trick and the Favour and Interest of three or four sordid Wretches have been found necessary for the obtaining Success every one who is duly qualify'd to write for the  Stage  has either with a just Disdain refus'd it or has undertaken it with extream Reluctancy The  Drama  therefore is like to be lost and all the Arts dependent on it therefore every one who is concern'd for the Honour of his Country ought to do his utmost Endeavour to prevent a Calamity which will be so great a Disgrace to it And all who are concern'd for the Honour of the  KING  ought to reflect with Indignation that by the Malice and the basest  Breach of Trust  of Persons whom  His MAJESTY  has appointed to encourage Literature all  the  Studies of Humanity are like to be  in his otherwise  spicious Reign  A DEFENCE OF Sir  Fopling Flutter  _A Certain Knight who has employ'd so much of his empty Labour in extolling the weak Performances of some living Authors has scurriously and inhumanly in the th Spectator attack'd one of the most entertaining Comedies of the last Age written by a most ingenious Gentleman who perfectly understood the World the Court  and the Town and whose Reputation has now for near thirty Years together surviv'd his Person and will in all Probability survive it as long as Comedy shall be in vogue by which Proceeding this worthy Knight has incurr'd the double Censure that  Olivia  in the pl  'd Dealer has cast upon a certain Coxcomb  Who rather  says she  then not flatter will flatter the Poets of the Age whom none will flatter and rather then not rail will rail at the Dead at whom none besides will rail  If other Authors have had the Misfortune to incurr the Censure of illnature with unthinking deluded People for no other so much as pretended Reason than because to improve a noble Art they have expos'd the Errors of popular Writers who ow'd their Success to the infamous Method of securing an ignorant or a corrupt Cabal when those Writers were not only living but in full Prosperity and at full Liberty to answer for themselves what Appellation must he deserve who has basely and scurrilously attack'd the Reputation of a Favourite of the comick Muse and of the Darling of the Graces after Death has for so many Years depriv'd  him of the Means of answering for himself  What the Knight falsely and impudently says of the Comedy may be justly said of the Criticism and of the whole th Spectator that 'tis a perfect Contradiction to good Manners and good Sense He allows this Comedy he says to be in Nature but 'tis Nature in its utmost Corruption and Degeneracy  Suppose this were true I would fain know where he learnt that Nature in its utmost Corruption and Degeneracy is not the proper Subject of Comedy Is not this a merry Person who after he has been writing what he calls Comedy for twenty Years together shews plainly to all the World that he knows nothing of the Nature of true Comedy and that he has not learnt the very first Rudiments of an Art which he pretends to teach I must confess the Ridicule in Sir  Fopling Flutter  is an Imitation of corrupt and degenerate Nature but not the most corrupt and the most degenerate for there is neither Adultery Murder nor Sodomy in it But can any Thing but corrupt and degenerate  Nature be the proper Subject of Ridicule And can any Thing but Ridicule be the proper Subject of Comedy Has not  Aristotle  told us in the Fifth Chapter of his Poeticks that Comedy is an Imitation of the very worst of Men Not the worst says He in every Sort of Vice but the worst in the Ridicule And has not  Horace  in the Fourth Satyr of his First Book reminded us that the old  Athenian  Comick Poets made it their Business to bring all Sorts of Villains upon the Stage Adulterers Cheats Theives Murderers But then they always took Care says a modern Critick that those several Villanies should be envelop'd in the Ridicule which alone says he could make them the proper Subjects of Comedy If this facetious Knight had formerly liv'd at  Lacedemon  with the same wrong turn'd Noddle that he has now among us would he not do you think have inveighed against that People for shewing their drunken Slaves to their Children Would he not have represented it as a Thing of most pernicious Example What the  Lacedemonians  did by Drunkenness the Comick Poet does by that and all other Vices He exposes them to the View of his Fellow Subjects for no  other Reason than to render them ridiculous and contemptible  But the Criticism of the Knight in the foresaid Spectator is as contrary to good Manners as it is to good Sense What  Aristotle  and his Interpreters say of Tragedy that 'tis infallibly good when it pleases both the Judges and the People is certainly as true of Comedy for the Judges are equally qualify'd to judge of both and the People may be suppos'd to be better Judges of Comedy then they are of Tragedy because Comedy is nothing but a Picture of common Life and a Representation of their own Humours and Manners Now this Comedy of Sir  Fopling Flutter  has not been only well receiv'd and believ'd by the People of  England  to be a most agreeable Comedy for about Half a Century but the Judges have been still more pleas'd with it then the People They have justly believ'd I speak of the Judges that the Characters and especially the principal Characters are admirably drawn to answer the two Ends of Comedy Pleasure and Instruction and that the Dialogue is the most charming that has been writ by the Moderns That with Purity and  Simplicity it has Art and Elegance and with Force and Vivacity the utmost Grace and Delicacy This I know very well was the Opinion of the most eminent Writers and of the best Judges contemporary with the Author and of the whole Court of King  Charles  the Second a Court the most polite that ever  England  saw  Now after this Comedy has pass'd with the whole People of  England  the knowing as well as the Ignorant for a most entertaining and most instructive Comedy for fifty Years together after that long Time comes a TwoPenny Author who has given a thousand Proofs thro' the Course of his Rhapsodies that he understands not a Tittle of all this Matter this Author comes and impudently declares that this whole celebrated Piece that has for half a Century been admir'd by the whole People of  Great Britain  is a perfect Contradiction to good Sense to good Manners and to common Honesty  O Tempora O Mores  The Knight certainly wrote the foremention'd Spectator tho' it as been writ these ten Years on Purpose to  make Way for his fine Gentleman and therefore he endeavours to prove that Sir  Fopling  is not that genteel Comedy which the World allows it to be And then according to his usual Custom whenever he pretends to criticise he does by shuffling and cutting and confounding Notions impose upon his unwary Reader for either Sir  George Etheridge  did design to make this a genteel Comedy or he did not If he did not design it what is it to the Purpose whether 'tis a genteel Comedy or not Provided that 'tis a good one For I hope a Comedy may be a good one and yet not a genteel one The  Alchimist  is an admirable Comedy and yet it is not a genteel one We may say the same of  The Fox and the silent Woman  and of a great many more But if Sir  George  did design to make it a genteel one he was oblig'd to adapt it to that Notion of Gentility which he knew very well that the World at that Time had and we see he succeeded accordingly For it has pass'd for a very genteel Comedy for fifty Years together Could it be expected that the admirable Author should accommodate himself to the wrong headed Notions of a would be Critick who was to appear fifty  Years after the first Acting of his Play A Gritick who writes Criticism as Men commit Treason or Murder by the Instigation of the Devil himself whenever the old Gentleman owes the Knight a Shame  To prove that this Comedy is not a genteel one he endeavours to prove that one of the principal Characters is not a fine Gentleman I appeal to every impartial Man if when he says that a Man or a Woman are genteel he means any Thing more than that they are agreeble in their Air graceful in in their Motions and polite in their Conversation But when he endeavours to prove that  Dorimont  is not a fine Gentleman he says no more to the Purpose then he said before when he affirm'd that the Comedy is not a genteel Comedy for either the Author design'd in  Dorimont  a fine Gentleman or he did not If he did not the Character is ne'er the less excellent on that Account because  Dorimnot  is an admirable Picture of a Courtier in the Court of King  Charles  the Second But if  Dorimont  was design'd for a fine Gentleman by the Author he was oblig'd to accommodate himself to that Notion of a  fine Gentleman which the Court And the Town both had at the Time of the writing of this Comedy 'Tis reasonable to believe that he did so and we see that he succeeded accordingly For  Dorimont  not only pass'd for a fine Gentleman with the Court of King  Charles  the Second but he has pass'd for such with all the World for Fifty Years together And what indeed can any one mean when he speaks of a fine Gentleman but one who is qualify'd in Conversation to please the best Company of either Sex  But the Knight will be satisfy'd with no Notion of a fine Gentleman but his own A fine Gentleman says he is one who is honest in his Actions and refin'd in his Language If this be a just Description of a fine Gentleman I will make bold to draw two Consequences from it The first is That a Pedant is often a fine Gentleman For I have known several of them who have been Honest in their Actions and Refin'd in their Language The second is That I know a certain Knight who though he should be allow'd to be a Gentleman born yet is not a fine Gentleman I shall only add that I would advise for the future all the fine Gentlemen  who travel to  London  from  Tipperary  to allow us  Englishmen  to know what we mean when we speak our native Language  To give a true Character of this charming Comedy it must be acknowledg'd that there is no great Mastership in the Design of it Sir  George  had but little of the artful and just Designs of  Ben Johnson  But as Tragedy instructs chiefly by its Design Comedy instructs by its Characters which nor only ought to be drawn truly in Nature but to be the resembling Pictures of our Contemporaries both in Court and Town Tragedy answers to HistoryPainting but Comedy to drawing of Portraits  How little do they know of the Nature of true Comedy who believe that its proper Business is to set us Patterns for lmitation For all such Patterns are serious Things and Laughter is the Life and the very Soul of Comedy 'Tis its proper Business to expose Persons to our View whose Views we may shun and whose Follies we may despise and by shewing us what is done upon the Comick Stage to shew us what ought never  to be done upon the Stage of the World  All the Characters in Sir  Foppling Flutter  and especially the principal Characters are admirably drawn both to please and to instruct First they are drawn to please because they are drawn in the Truth of Nature but to be drawn in the Truth of Nature they must be drawn with those Qualities that are proper to each respective Season of Life  This is the chief Precept given for the forming the Characters by the two Great Masters of the Rules which Nature herself dictated and which have  in every Age for the Standards of writing successfully and of judging surely unless it were with Poetasters and their foolish Admirers The Words of  Horace  in his  Art of Poetry  are these  v    Tu quid ego populo mecum desideret audi  Si sessoris eges aulaea manentis usque  Sessuri donec cantor vos plaudite dicat  Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores  Mobilibúsque decor naturis dandus annis  And thus my Lord  Roscommon  has translated it  Now hear what ev'ry AUditor expects  If you intend that he should stay to hear  The Epilogue and see the Curtain fall  Mark how our Tempers alter with our Tears  Then give the Beauty proper to each Age  And by this Rule form all your Characters  And now see the Character that  Horace  gives of a Person who is in the Bloom of his Years  De Arte Poetica v  Imberbis tandem juvenis custode remoto  Gaudet equis canibúsque aprici gramine campi  Cereus in vitium flecti monitoribus asper  Utilium tardus provisor prodigus aeris  Sublimis cupidúsque amata relinquere pernix  And thus the 'foresaid Noble Poet translates it  A Youth that first casts off his Tutor'S Yoke  Loves Horses HounDs and Sports and Exercise  Prone to all Vice impatient of Reproof  Proud careless fond inconstant and profuse  Now  Horace  to shew the Importance of this Precept as soon as he has done with the Characters of the four Parts of Life returns to it repeats it and enforces it  Ibid v  Ne fortè seniles  Mandentur juveni partes pueróque viriles  Semper in adjunctis aevóque morabimur aptis  That a Poet may never be guilty of such an Absurdity  says he  as to give the Character of an Old Man to a Young Man or of a Boy to a Middle Ag'd Man let him take Care to adhere to those Qualities which are necessarily or probably annexed to each respective Season of Life  If a Dramatick Poet does not observe this Rule he misses that which gives the Beauty and the Decorum which alone can make his Characters please  As  Horace  is but an Epitomizer of  Aristotle  in giving Rules for the Characters  that Philosopher gives us more at large the Character of a Person in his early Bloom in the th Chapter of the Second Book of his Rhetorick  Young Men  says he  have strong Appetites and are ready to undertake any thing in order to satisfy them and of all those Appetites which have a Relation to the Body they are most powerfully sway'd by Venereal ones in which they are very changeable and are quickly cloy'd For their Desires are rather acute than lasting like the Hunger and Thirst of the Sick They are prone to Anger and easily provok'd vehement in their Anger and ready to obey the Dictates of it For by Reason of the Concern which they have for their Honour they cannot bear the being undervalu'd but resent an Affront heinously And as they are desirous of Honour they are more ambitious of Victory For Youth is desirous of excelling and Victory is a Sort of Excellency  Thus far  Aristotle  And here it may not be amiss to shew that this Rule is founded in Reason and in Nature In order to which let us see what  Dacier  remarks upon that Verse of  Horace  which we cited above  Mobilibúsque decor naturis dandus annis  Behold says he a very fine and very significant Verse which tells us if we render it Word for Word  That we ought to give to moveable Natures and Years their proper Beauty By moveable Natures  says  Dacier  Horace  means Age which still runs on like a River and which as it runs gives different Inclinations to Men and those different Inclinations make what he calls  Decor  the Beauty proper to the Age For every Part of Man's Life has its proper Beauties like every Season of the Year He that gives to Manly Age the Beauties of Youth or to Youth the Beauties of Manly Age does like a Painter who should paint the Autumn with the Ornaments of Summer or the Summer with the Ornaments of Autumn  A Comick Poet who gives to a Young Man the Qualities that belong to a Middle Ag'd Man or to an Old Man can answer neither of the Ends of his Art He cannot please because he writes out of Nature of which all Poetry is an Imitation and without which no Poem can possibly please And as he cannot  please he cannot instruct because by shewing such a young Man as is not to be seen in the World he shews a Monster and not a Man sets before us a particular Character instead of an allegorical and universal one as all his Characters and especially his principal Characters ought to be and therefore can give no general Instruction having no Moral no Fable and therefore no Comedy  Now if any one is pleased to compare the Character of  Dorimont  to which the Knight has taken so much absurd Exception with the two forementioned Descriptions he will find in his Character all the chief distinguishing Strokes of them For such is the Force of Nature and so admirable a Talent had she given Sir  George  for Comedy that tho' to my certain Knowledge he understood neither  Greek  nor  Latin  yet one would swear that in drawing his  Dorimant  he copy'd the foresaid Draughts and especially that of  Aristotle Dorimont  is a young Courtier haughty vain and prone to Anger amorous false and inconstant He debauches  Loveit  and betrays her loves  Belinda  and as soon as he enjoys her is false to her  But dly The Characters in Sir  Fopling  are admirably contriv'd to please and more particularly the principal ones because we find in those Characters a true Resemblance of the Persons both in Court and Town who liv'd at the Time when that Comedy was writ For  Rapin  tells us with a great deal of Judgment  That Comedy is as it ought to be when an Audience is apt to imagine that instead of being in the Pit and Boxes they are in some Assembly of the Neighbourhood or in some Family Meeting and that we see nothing done in it but what is done in the World For it is  says he  not worth one Farthing if we do not discover our selves in it and do not find in it both our own Manners and those of the Persons with whom we live and converse  The Reason of this Rule is manifest For as 'tis the Business of a Comick Poet to cure his Spectators of Vice and Folly by the Apprehension of being laugh'd at 'tis plain that his Business must be with the reigning Follies and Vices The violent Passions which are the Subjects of Tragedy are the same in every Age and appear with the same Face but those Vices and Follies which  are the Subjects of Comedy are seen to vary continually Some of those that belonged to our Ancestors have no Relation to us and can no more come under the Cognisance of our present Comick Poets than the Sweating and Sneezing Sickness can come under the Practice of our contemporary Physicians What Vices and Follies may infect those who are to come after us we know not 'tis the present the reigning Vices and Follies that must be the Subjects of our present Comedy The Comick Poet therefore must take Characters from such Persons as are his Contemporaries and are infected with the foresaid Follies and Vices  Agreeable to this is the Advice which  Boileau  in his  Art of Poetry  gives to the Comick Poets  Etudiez la Cour connoissez la ville  L'une l'autre est tousoers en modeles fertile  Cest par lá que Moliere illustrant ses evrits  Peutetre de son Art eut remporté la prix c  Now I remember very well that upon the first acting this Comedy it  was generally believed to be an agreeable Representation of the Persons of Condition of both Sexes both in Court and Town and that all the World was charm'd with  Dorimont  and that it was unanimously agreed that he had in him several of the Qualities of  Wilmot  Earl of  Rochester  as his Wit his Spirit his amorous Temper the Charms that he had for the fair Sex his Falshood and his Inconstancy the agreeable Manner of his chiding his Servants which the late Bishop of  Salisbury  takes Notice of in his Life and lastly his repeating on every Occasion the Verses of  Waller  for whom that noble Lord had a very particular Esteem witness his lmitation of the Tenth Satire of the First Book of  Horace  Waller  by Nature for the Bays design'd  With Spirit Force and Fancy unconfind  In Panegyrick is above Mankind  Now as several of the Qualities in  Dorimont  's Character were taken from that Earl of  Rochester  so they who were acquainted with the late Sir  Fleetwood Shepherd  know very well that not a little of that Gentleman's Character is to be found in Medley  But the Characters in this Comedy are very well form'd to instruct as well as to please especially those of  Dorimont  and of  Loveit  and they instruct by the same Qualities to which the Knight has taken so much whimsical Exception as  Dorimont  instructs by his Insulting and his Perfidiousness and  Loveit  by the Violence of her Resentment and her Anguish For  Loveit  has Yough Beauty Quality Wit and Spirit And it was depending upon these that she repos'd so dangerous a Trust in  Dorimont  which is a just Caution to the Fair Sex never to be so conceited of the Power of their Charms or their other extraordinaryQualitiesas to believe they can engage a Man to be true to them to whom they grant the best Favour without the only sure Engagement without which they can never be certain that they shall not be hated and despis'd by that very Person whom they have done every Thing to oblige  To conclude with one General Observation That Comedy may be qualify'd in a powerful Manner both to instruct and to please the very Constitution of its Subject ought always to be Ridiculous Comedy says  Rapin  is an Image of common Life and its  End is to expose upon the Stage the Defects of particular Persons in order to cure the Defects of the Publick and to correct and amend the People by the Fear of being laugh'd at That therefore says he which is most essential to Comedy is certainly the Ridicule  Every Poem is qualify'd to instruct and to please most powerfully by that very Quality which makes the Fort and the Characteristick of it and which distinguishes it from all other Kinds of Poems As  Tragedy  is qualify'd to instruct and to please by Terror and Compassion which two Passions ought always to be predominant in it and to distinguish it from all other Poems  Epick Poetry  pleases and instructs chiefly by Admiration which reigns throughout it and distinguishes it from Poems of every other Kind Thus  Comedy  instructs and pleases most powerfully by the Ridicule because that is the Quality which distinguishes it from every other Poem The Subject therefore of every Comedy ought to be ridiculous by its Constitution the Ridicule ought to be of the very Nature and Essence of it Where there is none of that there can be no Comedy It ought to  reign both in the Incidents and in the Characters and especially in the principal Characters which ought to be ridiculous in themselves or so contriv'd as to shew and expose the Ridicule of others In all the Masterpieces of  Ben Johnson  the principal Character has the Ridicule in himself as  Morose  in  The Silent Woman    Volpone  in  The Fox  and  Subtle  and  Face  in  The Alchimist  And the very Ground and Foundation of all these  Comedies  is ridiculous 'Tis the very same Thing in the Masterpieces of  Moliere  The  Mis Antrope  the  Impostor  the  Avare  and the  Femmes Secuanter  Nay the Reader will find that in most of his other Pieces the principal Characters are ridiculous as  L'Etoardy    Les precieuses Ridicules    Le Cocu Imaginaire    Le Fascheux  and  Monsieur de pousceaugnac    Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme    L'Ecole de Maris    L'Ecole des Femmes    L'Amour Medicis    Le Medicin Malgré luy    La Mariage Forcé    George Dandin    Les Fourberies de Scapin    Le Malade Imaginaire  The Reader will not only find upon Reflection that in all these Pieces the principal Characters are ridiculous but that in most of them there is the Ridicule of  Comedy  in the very Titles  'Tis by the Ridicule that there is in the Character of Sir  Fopling  which is one of the principal ones of this  Comedy  and from which it takes its Name that he is so very well qualify'd to please and to instruct What true  Engglishman  is there but must be pleas'd to see this ridiculous Knight made the Jest and the Scorn of all the other Characters for shewing by his foolish aping foreign Customs and Manners that he prefers another Country to his own And of what important Instruction must it be to all our Youth who travel to shew them that if they so far forget the Love of their Country as to declare by their espousing foreign Customs and Manners that they prefer  France  or  Italy  to  Great Britain  at their Return they must justly expect to be the Jest and the Scorn of their own Countrymen  Thus I hope I have convinc'd the Reader that this Comical Knight Sir  Fopling  has been justly form'd by the Knight his Father to instruct and please whatever may be the Opinion to the contrary of the Knight his Brother  Whenever  The Fine Gentleman  of the latter comes upon the Stage I shall be  glad to see that it has all the shining Qualities which recommend Sir  Fopling  that his Characters are always drawn in Nature and that he never gives to a young Man the Qualities of a Middleaged Man or an old one that they are the just Images of our Contemporaries and of what we every Day see in the World that instead of setting us Patterns for our Imitation which is not the proper Business of  Comedy  he makes those Follies and Vices ridiculous which we ought to shun and despise that the Subject of his  Comedy  is comical by its Constitution and that the Ridicule is particularly in the Grand Incidents and in the principal Characters For a true Comick Poet is a Philosopher who like old  Democritus  always instructs us laughing  FINIS
