AUTHOR of  The Theory of the  EARTH  I  NO common Height the Muse must soar  That wou'd thy Fame in Numberstry  Nor dare in humble Verse adore  But rise with Thee above the Sky  You ask a bold and lofty strain  And what we meanly sing disdain  II  You  Nature's early Birth explore  Her disunited Frame disclose  From what mix'd Cause and jarring Power  The Infant Earth to Being rose  How in her Circling Bosom sleep  Th' imprison'd Seas and Bounded Deep  III  Resolv'd great hidden Truths to trace  Each Learned Fable you despise  And pleas'd enjoy the fam'd disgrace  To think and reason  singly wise  Each Tale reject by Time allow'd  And nobly leave the erring Crowd  IV  Hark▪ from her weak Foundations tore  The bursting Earth asunder flies  And prop'd by yielding Seas no more  The dreadful Crack alarms the Skies  Whose Arches rent their Weight forego  And plunge in opening Gulphs below  V  Now rushing from their watry Bed  The  driving  Waves disdain a shore  And with resistless Force o'erspread  That Orb which check'd their Rage before  While scattered o'er the foamy Tide  All Nature's floating Ruins ride  VI  New Heavens disclos'd the Silver Train  The SUN beneath their Waves admire  And gliding thro' th' enlight'ned Main  Gaze at each STAR'S diminish'd Fire  Well pleas'd the MOON'S bright Orb survey  Trembling along their Azure Way  VII  How strong each Line each Thought how great  With what an Energy you rise  How shines each Fancy with what Heat  Does every glowing Page surprize  While spouting Oceans upward flow  Or sink again to Caves below  VIII  As Nature's Doom you thus impart  The moving Scene we scarce endure  But shrinking ask our anxious Heart  If on our Earth we tread secure  Whose Fate unmov'd as you persue  We start and  tremble  but to view  IX  Yet  these  Remains we now behold  Which Tow'ring once in Hills arose  Shall from a New and fairer Mould  A New and fairer Earth compose  Which to her Fate shall Owe her Bloom  And rise more lovely from her Tomb  X  Yet see  This  beauteous Fabrick end  This  Second Pride of Fate expire  While gushing from the Clouds descend  The Burning Storm the Liquid Fire  Where Worlds and Men consuming lie  And in One bright Confusion Die  XI  Their naked Tops the Hills admire  No longer white with fleecy Dew  And as they moan the spreading Fire  Add to the Flames dissolving too  While Rocks from melting Mountains flow  And roll in Streams thro' Vales below  XII  And now the Kindling Orbs on high  All Nature's mournful End proclaim  When thy great WORK Alas must die  And feed the rich victorious Flame  Give Vigour to the wasting Fire  And with the World TOO SOON expire  XIII  Once more her Bloom the Earth renews  Smooth'd into Green eternal Vales  Her Glebe still moist with fragrant Dews  Her Air  still  rich with balmy Gales  No Change her Flowry Seasons breed  But Springs retire and Springs succeed  XIV  Oh say  Thou  Great  Thou  Sacred Name  What Scenes Thy thoughtful Breast employ  Capacious as that  mighty  Frame  You raise with Ease with Ease destroy  Each World shall boast thy Fame and YOU  Who charm'd the OLD shall grace the NEW  AD D D HANNES INSIGNISSIMUM MEDICUM POETAM  O QUI canoro blandiùs Orpheo  Vocale ducis carmen exitu  Feliciore luctuosis  Saepe animam revocas ab umbris  Jam seu solutos in numerum pedes  Cogis vel aegrum vix

Fornax error sanguinis vigor  Innatus herbis te fatigant  Seriùs aut citiùs sepulchro  Debemur omnes vitáque deseret  Expulsa morbis corpus inhospitum  Lentúmque deflebunt nepotes  Relliquias Animae

ODE TO Dr  HANNES  An Eminent PHYSICIAN and POET  I  WHILE flying o'er the Golden Strings  You gently wake the tuneful Lyre  Or tender as when ORPHEUS sings  With  softer  Sounds the Harp inspire  Sad fleeting Ghosts with Art constrain  Back to a  kinder Life  again  II  Whether in graceful Lays you shine  And Verse your easy Hours employ  Or give the Soul her mouldring Shrine  Decay'd a  Fairer  to enjoy  The Body cold in Death explore  Thy Skill could only  not  restore  III  Awhile thy learned Toil decline  Nor anxious more in smiles allow  The Circling Glass the Generous Wine  T'unbend and smooth thy chearful Brow  Nor longer to  thy self  severe  In the rich Draught forget thy care  IV  Now with thy Monarch's Glory fir'd  Let  Great  NASSAU thy Thirst inflame  Or by his MOUNTAGUE  The late Earl of  Halifax  inspir'd  Record the Patriot's faithful Name  By whose wise Arts and watchful Pains  HE Rules in Peace in Safety Reigns  V  At length thy mournful Task forbear  From sad'ning Thoughts some respite find  And while we  bless  thy pious Care  Be to thy self  in pity  kind  Inspir'd with your own Blessings live  Nor want  Your self  that Bloom  you  give  VI  In vain the Blood's tumultuous Tide  And circling Stream your Hand restrains  Taught o'er the Pulses to preside  And well explore the bubbling Veins  That with the Fever's swelling Heat  Glow  more  inflam'd  more  fiercely beat  VII  In vain you try each  Chymic Power  Trace to its Spring the Sanguine Wave  And kindly search  each  healing Flower  For Helps to guard us from the Grave  In endless Bloom to bid us live  Which THOU nor THEY Alas can give  VIII  One certain Fate by Heaven decreed  In spite of Thee we all must try  When from her bursting Prison freed  The mounting Soul shall  claim  the Sky  Our Sons must once lament our Doom  And shed their Sorrows round our Tomb  IX  Thou  too shalt with pale Horror see  The Fabled Ghosts which glare below  Which to the Shades restrain'd by  Thee  In thinner Shoals descending flow  And Death whose Power you now defy  Shall boast her Conqueror  can  Die  X  His  Life alone is greatly blest  Whom no intruding Griefs annoy  Who smiles each happy Day possest  Of chearful  Ease  and harmless  Joy  Nor  sadly  soothing his own Cares  Augments himself the Weight he bears  XI  Pleas'd with a few selected Friends  He views each smiling Evening close  While each succeeding Morn ascends  Charg'd with Delights unmark'd with Woes  In Pleasures innocently gay  Wears the Remains of Life away
