into Life and have since continued to  encourage me by Your Countenance and Favour and I cannot help confessing that  have a kind of honest Pride in having  known that Your LORDSHIP thought m  worthy to be taken under Your Protection  These my LORD are the general Obliga+tions that I owe You of which I have eve  wished to raise some Monument that ma  remain as long as my Name shall be remem+bered but I have more particular Reasons fo  presenting You with this Tragedy as it w  Your LORDSHIP first pointed out to me t  Subject and when it was finished gave  the first Assurance of its Success by Yo  Approbation I could not therefore  taking Advantage of this Opportunity to  knowledge publickly all these Favours and to assure You that I am  Your Lordship's most Obliged Most Obedient and Very Humble Servant HENRY JONE  To Mr  HENRY JONES  on his Tragedy of the  Earl of ESSEX  AS ancient Heroes are renown'd in Song  For rescuing Virtue from th'Oppressor's Wrong  So shall thy Fame who snatch'd this wellwrought Tale  From Dulness' gloomy Pow'r o'er Time prevail  Long had these Scenes wound up with dext'rous Art  In spight of Reason gain'd upon the Heart  Thaw'd ev'ry frozen Fountain of the Eye  We wept 'till even Sorrow's self was dry  Yet Judgment scorn'd what Passion had approv'd  And the Head wonder'd how the Heart was mov'd  But with a Fate revers'd thy Work shall boast  That soundest Judgments shall admire it most  Cloath'd in the easy Grandeur of thy Lines  The Story brightens as the Diction shines  Renew'd with Vigour as in Age 'tis grown  The wond'ring Scene sees Beauties not it's own  Thus worn with Years in  Afric  's sultry Vales  The crested Snake shifts off his tarnish'd Scales  Assumes fresh Beauties brighter than the old  Of changing Colours intermix'd with Gold  Reburnish'd basks beneath the scorching Ray  Shines with new Glories in the Face of Day  arts fiercer Lightning from his brandish'd Tongue  olls more sublime and seems at least more young  No more shall Noise and wild bombastic Rage  surp th' applauding Thunder of the Stage  ustain no more shall pass for true Sublime  or Nonsense musically float in Rhime  or in a worse Extreme shall creeping Prose  or Nature and Simplicity impose  By thee reform'd each vicious Taste shall fail  And Critic Justice hold aloft her Scale  Whence beams this dazling Lustre on thy Mind  Whence this vast Fund of Knowledge in Mankind  Unletter'd Genius Whence hast thou been taught  This Dignity of Stile this Majesty of Thought  This rapid Fire by cool Correctness rul'd  And ev'ry learned Elegance unschool'd  Say hath great  Shakespear  's transmigrated Shade  Inform'd thy Mass or lent thee friendly Aid  To him bless'd Bard untaught 'twas also giv'n  T' ascend on native Wings Invention's brightest Heaven  Alluding to the Prologue to  Henry  V  Assuming  Phoebus'  Port and in his Train  The Muses all like Handmaids not in vain  Crouch for Employment  The Passions too subservient to his Will  Attentive wait on his superior Skill  At the Command of his inchanting Art  Unlock the bursting Floodgates of the Heart  And in the rapid headlong Stream bear down  The vanquish'd Soul and make it all his own  Happy the Clime distinguish'd be the Age  When Genius shoots spontaneous for the Stage  Not too luxuriant nor too trimly neat  But in loose Wildness negligently great  O may the gen'rous Plants so wond'rous rare  Ne'er want the tender Hand of fost'ring care  But like  Apollo  's fav'rite Tree be seen  For ever flourishing for ever green  M  c  NAMARA MORGAN  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BARRY  OUR desp'rate Bard a bold Excursion tries  Tho' Danger damp'd his Wing he dar'd to rise  From Hope high rais'd all glorious Actions spring  'Tis hence that Heroes conquer Poets sing  Even he may feel the soulexalting Fire  Fame prompts the humblest Bosom to aspire  Without a Guide this rash Attempt he made  Without a Clue from Art or Learning's Aid  He takes a Theme where tend'rest Passions glow  A Theme your Grandsires felt with pleasing Woe  ESSEX'  sad Tale he strives to cloath anew  And hopes to place it in a stronger View  Poets like Painters may by equal Law  The labour'd Piece from different Masters draw  Perhaps improve the Plan add Fire and Grace  And strike th' impassion'd Soul through all the Face  How far our Author has secur'd a Claim  To this exalted Palm this wish'dfor Fame  Your generous Sentiments will soon declare  Humanity is ever prone to spare  'Twere Baseness then your Candour to distrust  A  BRITISH  Audience will at least be just  A flattering Truth he fearful must confess  His sanguine Friends made Promise of Success  But that he fears their ardent Wishes wrought  Since partial Favour seldom sees a Fault  Then bear like patient Friends

SCENE  an Antichamber in the Palace  Enter  BURLEIGH  and  RALEIGH  BURLEIGH  THE Bill at length has pass'd opposing Numbers  Whilst Crowds seditious clamour'd round the senate  nd headlong Faction urg'd its Force within  RALEIGH  is my LordThe wish'dfor Day is come  h  n this proud Idol of the People's Hearts  all now no more be worshipp'd  Essex  falls  y Lord the Minute's near that shall unravel  e mystic Schemes of this aspiring Man  w Fortune with officious Hand invites us  her and opens wide the Gates of Greatness  The Way to Power My Heart exults I see  I see my Lord our utmost Wish accomplish'd  I see great  Cecil  shine without a Rival  And  England  bless him as her Guardian Saint  Such potent Instruments I have prepar'd  As shall with speed o'erturn this hated Man  And dash him down by Proof invincible  BURLEIGH  His Day of Glory now is set in Night  And all my anxious Hopes at last are crown'd  Those Proofs against him  Raleigh    RALEIGH  All arriv'd  BURLEIGH  Arriv'd how when  RALEIGH  This very Hour my Lord  Nay more a Person comes of high Distinction  To prove some secret Treaties made by  Essex  With  Scotland  's Monarch and the proud  Tyrone  BURLEIGH  How say'st to prove 'em  RALEIGH  Ay my Lord and back'd  With Circumstances of a stronger Nature  It now appears his Secretary  Cuff  With  Plunt  and  Lee  were deep concern'd in this  Destructive Scheme contriv'd to raise this Lord  And ruin  Cecil  O it is a subtil  A deeplaid Mischief by the Earl contriv'd  In Hour malignant to o'erturn the State  And Horror to conceive dethrone the Queen  BURLEIGH  These gladsome Tidings fly beyond my Hopes  The Queen will listen now will now believe  And trust the Counsel of her faithful  Burleigh  Let this most lucky Circumstance be kept  A Secret still from public Observation  Dispose 'em well till kind Occasion call  Their Office forth lest prying Craft mean while  May tamper with their Thoughts and change their Minds  Let them like Batteries conceal'd appear  At once both to surprize and to destroy  RALEIGH  This  den Shock my Lord this weighty Stroke  Must press him headlong down to deep Destruction  Indignant Fate marks out this dreaded Man  And Fortune now has left him  BURLEIGH  Thank the Changeling  His servile Faction soon will stand aghast  And sink at distance from his threat'ning Fall  RALEIGH  His head strong Friend the bold  Southampton  too  Now finds his rash Endeavours all defeated  And storms at thee and the impeaching Commons  BURLEIGH  Let him rave on and rage The Lion in  The Toils entangled wastes his Strength and roars  In vain his Efforts but amuse me now  RALEIGH  What Triumphs in my Soul shall reign to see  This sanguine and o'erbearing Man brought down  Beneath my Envy nay below my Scorn  How young Ambition swells my rising Hopes  Tis Heaven O  Cecil  calls thro'  England  's Voice  And Justice bending from above invites us  Enter  GENTLEMAN  GENTLEMAN  My Lord the Lady  Nottingham  desires  With much Impatience to attend your Lordship  BURLEIGH  What may the Purport of her Bus'ness be  Her tender Wishes are to  Essex  ty'd  In Love's soft Fetters and endearing Bands  For him each melting Thought awakes Desire  And all her Soul is lavish'd on that Lord  This unexpected Visit much surprizes me  What can it mean She would not come to pry  And pick out Tales for  Essex  's EarWhy let her  I'm arm'd secure against her Arts and Cunning  Besides her Errand comes too late for now  Her Minion's doom'd to fall Conduct her in  Exit  Gent  And you my  Raleigh  watch  Southampton  's Steps  With Care observe each Movement of his Friends  Let no Advantage on that Side be lost  Exit  Ral  Southampton  's  Essex'  second Self he shares  His headlong Councils and adopts his Schemes  His daring Heart and bold ungovern'd Tongue  Are both enlisted in the rash Designs  Of this proud Lord nor knows a Will but his  A Limb so fix'd must with the Body fall  Enter Lady  NOTTINGHAM  NOTTINGHAM  Thrice hail to rescu'd  England  's guiding Genius'  His Country's Guardian and his Queen's Defence  Great  Burleigh  thou whose Patriot Bosom beats  With  Albion  's Glory and  Eliza  's Fame  Who shield'st her Person and support'st her Throne  For thee what fervent Thanks what offer'd Vows  Do prostrate Millions pay  BURLEIGH  Bright Excellence  This fair Applause too highly overrates  To much extols the low Deserts of  Cecil  NOTTINGHAM  What Praises are too high for PatriotWorth  Or what Applause exceeds the Price of Virtue  My Lord Conviction has at last subdu'd me  And I am Honour's Proselytetoo long  My erring Heart pursu'd the Ways of Faction  Lown myself t' have been your bitt'rest Foe  And join'd with  Essex  in each soul Attempt  To blast your Honour and traduce your Fame  BURLEIGH  Tho' ne'er my wishing Heart could call you Friend  Yet Honour and Esteem I always bore you  And never meant but with Respect to serve you  It grieves me Madam to have thus offended  Where most my Wishes labour'd to oblige  NOTTINGHAM  I know your Honour and your Virtues well  Your public Plans design'd for  England  's Good  And ad your private Merit's WeightBut Oh  How blind is Reason in the Maze of Passion  I sought your Ruin labour'd for your Fall  But it Repentance may attone for Guilt  Or Selfreproach for sharpest Penance pass  No mortal Breast e'er felt more Woe than mine  And  burleigh  now may rank me for his Friend  BURLEIGH  That  a Worth of Soul should be abus'd  Could accuse my Heart but of a Thought  you Wrong If any Purpose ever  gainst your Welfare in my Soul arose  That look'd with Malice on your shining Merit  Your matchless Beauty or your brighter Virtues  Then let me live despis'd a Proverb made  To every passing Slave nay more the Scorn  And trampl'd Footstool of the Man I hate  NOTTINGHAM  It is enough my Lord I know it well  And feel rekindling Virtue warm my Breast  Honour and Gratitude their Force resume  Within my Heart and every Wish is your's  O  Cecil Cecil  what a Foe hast thou  A deadly Foe whilst hated  Essex  lives  BURLEIGH  I know it well but can assign no Cause  NOTTINGHAM  Ambition's restless Hand has wound his Thoughts  Too high for  England  's Welfare nay the Queen  Scarce sits in Safety on her Throne while he  Th' audacious  Essex  freely treads at large  And breathes the common Air Ambition is  The only God he serves to whom he'd sacrifice  His Honour Country Friends and every Tye  Of Truth and Bond of Nature nay his Love  BURLEIGH  I find this Bus'ness works as I would have it  Aside  The Man that in his public Duty fails  On private Virtues will disdainful tread  As Steps to raise him to some higher Purpose  In vain each softer Wish would plead with him  No tender Movement in his Soul prevails  And mighty Love who rules all Nature else  Must follow here in proud Ambition's Train  NOTTINGHAM  Pronounce it not my Soul abhors the Sound  Like Death O  Cecil  will you kindly lend  Some Pity to a Wretch like me  BURLEIGH  Command  Madam my Power and Will are yours I feel  Your Wrongs I feel the base Returns you've met  From this ungrateful and disloyal Man  Tho' oft your Goodness screen'd him from Reproof  Believe me worthy to partake your Grievance  Accept my Service and employ my Power  NOTTINGHAM  Will  Cecil  's friendly Ear vouchsafe to bend  It's great Attention to a Woman's Wrongs  Whose Pride and Shame Resentment and Despair  Rise up in raging Anarchy at once  To tear with ceaseless Pangs my tortur'd Soul  Words are unequal to the Woes I feel  And Language lessens what my Heart endures  Passion repuls'd with Scorn and proud Disdain  Recoils indignant on my shrinking Soul  Beats back my vital Springs and crushes Life  BURLEIGH  Madam your Wrongs I must confess are great  Yet still I fear you know not half his Falshood  Who that had Eyes to look on Beauty Who  That had a Heart to feel that Beauty's Power  Who but the false perfidious  Essex  cou'd  Prefer to  Nottingham  a  Rutland  's Charms  Start not By Heav'n I tell you nought but Truth  What I can prove past doubt that he receiv'd  The Lady  Rutland  's Hand in sacred Wedlock  The very Night before his setting out  For  Ireland  NOTTINGHAM  O may quick Destruction seize 'em  May Furies blast and Hell destroy their Peace  May all their Nights  BURLEIGH  I pray have Patience Madam  Restrain a while your Rage Curses are vain  But there's a surer Method to destroy him  And if you'll join with me 'tis done he falls  NOTTINGHAM  Ha say'st thou  Burleigh  speak my Genius speak  Be quick as Vengeance' self to tell me how  BURLEIGH  You must have heard the Commons have impeach'd him  And we have Proofs sufficient for his Ruin  But then the Queen you know how fair he stands  In her Esteem and  Rutland  too his Wife  Hath full Possession of the Royal Ear  What then avail Impeachments or the Law's  Severest Condemnation while the Queen  May snatch him from th' uplifted Hand of Justice  Here then my  Nottingham  begins thy Task  Try ev'ry Art t' incense the Queen against him  Then step between her and the Lady  Rutland▪  Let not her Fondness find the least Access  To the Queen's Heart to counterwork our Purpose  Observe  Southampton  too with jealous Eye  Prevent as much as possible his Suit  For well I know he will not fail to try  His Eloquence on the Behalf of  Essex  NOTTINGHAM  It shall be done his Doom is fix'd he dies  O 'twas a precious Thought I never knew  Such Heartfelt Satisfaction  Essex  dies  And  Rutland  in her Turn shall learn to weep  The Time is precious I'll about it streight  Come Vengeance come assist me now to breathe  Thy venom'd Spirit in the Royal Ear  Exit  Nottingham  BURLEIGH  There spoke the very Genius of the Sex  A disappointed Woman sets no Bounds  To her Revenge Her Temper's form'd to serve  Enter  RALEIGH  RALEIGH  The Lord  Southampton  with ungovern'd Rage  Resents aloud his disappointed Measures  I met him in the outward Court he seeks  In haste your Lordship and forgetting Forms  Pursues me hither and demands to see you  BURLEIGH  Raleigh  'tis wellWithdrawAttend the Queen  Leave me to deal with this o'erbearing Man  Ex  Ral  Enter  SOUTHAMPTON  SOUTHAMPTON  Where is the Man whom Virtue calls her Friend  I give you Joy my Lord Your quenchless Fury  At length prevails and now your Malice triumphs  You've hunted Honour to the Toil of Faction  And view his Struggles with malicious Joy  BURLEIGH  What means my Lord  SOUTHAMPTON  O Fraud shall valiant  Essex  Be made a Sacrifice to your Ambition  Oh it smells foul indeed of rankest Malice  And the vile Statesman's CraftYou dare not sure  Thus bid Defiance to each Shew of Worth  Each Claim of Honour dare not injure thus  Your suffering Country in her bravest Son  BURLEIGH  ut why should stern Reproach her angry Brow  et fall on me Am I alone the Cause  That gives this working Humour Strength Do I  struct the public Voice to warp his Actions  Justice untaught shall poize th' impartial Scales  And every curious Eye may mark the Beam  SOUTHAMPTON  The specious Shield which private Malice bears  Is ever blazon'd with some public Good  Behind that artful Fence sculk low conceal'd  The bloody Purpose and the poison'd Shaft  Ambition there and Envy nestle close  From thence they take their fatal Aim unseen  And honest Merit is the destin'd Mark  BURLEIGH  Your warm distemper'd zeal puts rashly by  The cool directing Hand of wholesome Reason  No Imputation  oul shall rest on me  My honest Purposes defy aloud  The slanderspreading Tongue of busy Faction  To cast its Venom on my fair Report  Or tell Posterity Thus  Cecil  did  My Country's Welfare and my Queen's Comma  Have ever been my guiding Stars thro' Life  My sure Direction still To these I now  Appeal from these no doubt this Lord's Miscond  Hath widely stray'd and Reason not reviling  Must now befriend his Cause  SOUTHAMPTON  How ill had Providence  Dispos'd the suffering World's opprest Affairs  Had sacred Right's eternal Rule been left  To crafty Politicians' partial Sway  Then Power and Pride wou'd stretch th' enormous  And call their arbitrary Portion Justice  Ambition's Arm by Av'rice urg'd wou'd pluck  The Core of Honesty from Virtue's Heart  And plant Deceit and Rancour in its Stead  Falshood wou'd trample then on Truth and Hono  And Envy poison sweet Benevolence  Oh 'tis a goodly Groupe of Attributes  And well befits some Statesmen's righteous Rule  Out out upon such base and bloody Doings  The Term of Being is not worth the Sin  No human Bosom can endure its Dart  Then put this cruel Purpose from thee far  Nor let the Blood of  Essex  whelm thy Soul  BURLEIGH  Tis well my Lord your Words no Comment need  No doubt they've well explain'd your honest Meaning  Tis clear and full To Parts like yours Discretion  Wou'd be a Clog and Caution but Incumbrance  Yet mark me well my Lord the clinging Ivy  With th' Oak may rife but with it too must fall  SOUTHAMPTON  Thy empty Threats ambitious Man hurt not  The Breast of Truth Fair Innocence and Faith  Those Strangers to thy practis'd Heart shall shield  My Honour and preserve my FriendIn vain  Thy Malice with unequal Arm shall strive  To tear th' applauded Wreath from  Essex'  Brow  His honest Laurei held alost by Fame  Above thy blasting reach shall safely flourish  And bloom immortal to the latest Times  Whilst thou amidst thy tangling Snares involv'd  Shalt sink confounded and unpitied fall  BURLEIGH  Rail on proud Lord and give thy Choler vent  It wastes itself in vain the Queen shall judge  Between us in this warm Debate To her  I now repair and in her royal Presence  You may approve your Innocence and Faith  Perhaps you'll meet me there Till then farewel  Exit  SOUTHAMPTON  Confusion wait thy Steps thou cruel Monster  My noble and illustrious Friend betray'd  By crafty Faction and tyrannic Power  His sinking Trophies and his falling Fame  Oppress my very Soul I'll to the Queen  Lay all their Envy open to her View  Confront their Malice and preserve my Friend  Exit  The  QUEEN  discovered sitting on her Throne  RALEIGH  Lords and Attendants  QUEEN  Without consulting me presumptuous Man  Who governs here What am not I your Queen  You dar'd not were he present take this Step  RALEIGH  Dread Sovereign your ever faithful Commons  Have in their Gratitude and Love for you  Preferr'd this salutary Bill against him  Enter  BURLEIGH  QUEEN  You my Lord  Burleigh  must have known of this  The Commons here impeach the Earl of  Essex  Of practicing against the State and me  Methinks I might be trusted with the Secret  Speak for I know it well 'twas thy Contrivance  Ha was it not You dare not say it was not  BURLEIGH  I own my Judgment did concur with theirs  His Crimes I fear will justify the Charge  And vindicate their Loyalty and mine  QUEEN  Ha tell not me your smooth deceitful Story  I know your Projects and your close Cabals  You'd turn my Favour into Party Feuds  And use my Scepter as the Rod of Faction  But  Henry's  Daughter claims a nobler Soul  I'll nurse no party but will reign o'er all  And my sole Rule shall be to bless my People  Who serves them best has still my highest Favour  This  Essex  ever did  Enter  SOUTHAMPTON  Behold  Southampton  What a base Portrait's here The faithful  Essex  Here drawn at large associating with Rebels  To spoil his Country and dethrone his Queen  SOUTHAMPTON  It is not like By Heav'n the Hand of Envy  Drew these false Lines distorted far from Truth  And Honour and unlike my noble Friend  As Light to Shade or Hell to highest Heav'n  Then suffer not thou best of Queens this Lord  This valiant Lord to fall a Sacrifice  To Treachery and base Designs who now  Engages Death in all his horrid Shapes  Amidst a hardy race inur'd to Danger  But let him face to face this Charge encounter  And every Falshood like his Foes shall fly  QUEEN  To me you seem to recommend strict Justice  In all her Pomp of Power But are you sure  No subtil Vice conceal'd assumes her Garb  Take heed that Malice does not wear the Mask  Nor Envy deck her in the borrow'd Guise  Rancour has often darken'd Reason's Eye  And Judgment winks when Passion holds the Scale  mpeach the very Man to whom I owe  My brightest Rays of Glory Look to it Lords  Take care be cautious on what Ground you tread  Let honest Means alone secure your Footing  Raleigh  and you withdraw and wait our Leisure  Exeunt  Ral  and  South  Lord  Burleigh  stay we must with you have farther  Conf'renceI see this base Contrivance plain  Your Jealousy and Pride your Envy of  His shining Merit brought this Bill to Light  But mark me as you prize our high regard  And Favour I command you to suppress it  Let not our Name and Power be embarrass'd  In your perplexing Schemes 'Twas you began  And therefore you must end it  BURLEIGH  I obey  Yet humbly would intreat you to consider  How new unpopular this Step must be  To stand between your Parliament's Enquiry  And this offending LordWe have such Proofs  QUEEN  Reserve your Proofs to a more proper Season  And let them then appear But once again  We charge you on your Duty and Allegiance  To stop this vile Proceeding and to wait  Till  Essex  can defend himself in Person  If then your Accusations are of Force  The Laws and my Consent no doubt are open  He has my strict Command with Menace mix'd  To end effectually this hated War  Ere he presume to quit the  Irish  Coast  BURLEIGH  Madam my Duty now compels me to  QUEEN  No more see that my Orders be obey'd  Exit  Bur  Essex  a Traytor it can never be  His grateful and his honest Soul disdains it  I know him hot ambitious rash impatient  But then he's firmly anchor'd in his Duty  Tho' stormy passions toss him to and fro  Can he prove false so high advanc'd so honour'd  So near my FavourandI fear so near  My HeartImpossibleThis  Burleigh  hates him  And as his Rival therefore would destroy him  But he shall find his narrow Schemes defeated  In vain their fraudful Efforts shall combine  To shake my settled Soul my firm Design  Resolv'd to lift bright Virtue's Palm on high  Support her Grandeur and her Foes defy  Exit  ACT II  Enter  BURLEIGH  and  RALEIGH  BURLEIGH  ESSEX  arriv'd Confusion to my Hopes  His Presence will destroy me with the Queen  I much suspect he had some private Notice  Perhaps a punctual Order to return  He lurks too near her HeartWhat's to be done  Prepare the Witnesses with Speed apprize  The Lady  Nottingham    Southampton  's Pride  And  Rutland  's too will lift the Crest again  But fly my  Raleigh  send me  Nottingham  Exit  Ral  We must alarm the Queen with new Commotions  In many Parts of her Dominions rais'd  All this and more must now be pass'd for Truth  This sudden Blow has struck me to the Soul  'Tis gone too far he diesproud  Essex  now  Or  Cecil  falls Now is th' important Crisis  Keep up thy usual Strength my better Genius  Direct my Steps to crush my mortal Foe  Enter  QUEEN  and  RALEIGH  QUEEN  It cannot beReturn'd without my Leave  Against my strict CommandImpossible  RALEIGH  Madam the Earl is now at Court and begs  An Audience of your Majesty  QUEEN  Amazing  What break his Trust desert his high Command  Forsake his Post and disobey his Queen  'Tis falseinvented allYou wish it so  BURLEIGH  Madam I wish some other Rumours false  Reports I fear of great Concern to you  QUEEN  What Rumours what Reports Your Frown wou'd much  Denote your Preface seems importantSpeak  BURLEIGH  Some new Commotions are of late sprung up  In  Ireland  where the West is all in Arms  And moves with hasty March to join  Tyrone  And all his Northern Clans A dreadful Power  Nay more we have Advices from the Borders  Of sudden Risings near the Banks of  Tweed  'Tis thought to favour an Attempt from  Scotland  Mean while  Tyrone  embarks six thousand Men  To land at  Milford  and to march where  Essex  Shall join them with his Friends  QUEEN  In League with  James  And plotting with  Tyrone  It cannot be  His very Pride disdains such Perfidy  But is not  Essex  here without my Leave  Against my strict Command that that's Rebellion  The rest if true or false it matters not  What's to be doneadmit him to my Presence  No nomy Dignity my Pride forbid it  Ungrateful Man approach me not rise rise  Resentment and support my Soul Disdain  Do thou assist meYes it shall be so  BURLEIGH  I see she muses deep her Mind works upwards  And paints it's struggling Efforts in her Face  Tyrone  's Invasion wakes her Fear and Anger  And all her Soul is one continued Storm  QUEEN  For once my Pride shall stoop and I will see  This rash audacious this once favour'd Man  But treat him as his daring Crimes deserve  Enter  SOUTHAMPTON  SOUTHAMPTON  kneeling  Permit me Madam to approach you thus  Thus lowly to present the humble Suit  Of the much injur'd faithful Earl of  Essex  Who dares not unpermitted meet your Presence  He begs most gracious Queen to fall before  Your royal Feet to clear him to his Sovereign  Whom next to Heav'n he wishes most to please  Let Faction load him with her labouring Hand  His Innocence shall rise against the Weight  If but his gracious Mistress deign to smile  QUEEN  Let him appear  Exit  South  Now to thy trying Task  My Soul put forth exert thy utmost Strength  Nor let an injur'd Queen be tame Lye still  My Heart I cannot listen to thee now  Enter  ESSEX  and  SOUTHAMPTON  ESSEX  Forgive thou injur'd Majesty thou best  Of Queens this seeming Disobedience See  I bend submissive in your royal Presence  With Soul as penitent as if before  Th' allsearching Eye of Heav'n But Oh that Frown  My Queen's Resentment wounds my inmost Spirit  Strikes me like Death and pierces thro' my Heart  QUEEN  You have obey'd my Lord you've serv'd me well  My deadly Foes are quell'd and you come home  A Conqueror your Country bids you welcome  And I your Queen applaudTriumphant Man  What is it thus that  Essex  gains his Laurels  And is it thus you've borne my high Commission  How durst you disregard your trusted Duty  Desert your Province and betray your Queen  ESSEX  I came to clear my injur'd Name from Guilt  Imputed Guilt and slanderous Accusations  My Shame was wafted in each passing Gale  Each swelling Tide came loaded with my Wrongs  And Echo sounded forth from Faction's Voice  The Traytor Essex  Was't not hard my Queen  That whilst I stood in Danger's dreadful Front  Encountering Death in every shape of Terror  And bleeding for my CountryWas't not hard  My mortal Enemies at home like Cowards  Shou'd in my Absence basely blast my Fame  QUEEN  It is the Godlike Attribute of Kings  To raise the Virtuous and protect the Brave  I was the Guardian of your Reputation  What Malice or what Faction then cou'd reach you  My Honour was expos'd engag'd for your's  But you found Reason to dislike my Care  And to yourself assum'd the wrested Office  ESSEX  If aught disloyal in this Bosom dwells  If aught of Treason lodges in this Heart  May I to Guilt and lasting Shame be wedded  The Sport of Faction and the Mark of Scorn  The World's Derision and my Queen's Abhorrence  Stand forth the Villain whose invenom'd Tongue  Would taint my Honour and traduce my Name  Or stamp my Conduct with a Rebel's Brand  Lives there a Monster in the Haunts of Men  Dares tear my Trophies from their pillar'd Base  Eclipse my Glory and disgrace my Deeds  QUEEN  This ardent Language and this glow of Soul  Were nobly graceful in a better Cause  Where Virtue warrants and where Truth inspires  But injur'd Truth with Brow invincible  Frowns stern Reproof upon the false Assertion  And contradicts it with the Force of Facts  From me you have appeal'd ungrateful Man  The Laws not I must listen to your Plea  Go stand the Test severe abide the Tryal  And mourn too late the Bounty you abus'd  Exit  Queen Southampton c  ESSEX  Is this the just Requital then of all  My PatriotToils and oftencounter'd Perils  Amidst th' Inclemencies of Camps and Climes  Then be it soUnmov'd and dauntless let me  This Shock of adverse Fortune firmly stand  But yet methinks 'tis somewhat sudden too  My Greatness now depriv'd of each Support  Which bore so long its envy'd Weight aloft  Must quick to ruin fall and crush my Hopes  Enter  SOUTHAMPTON  SOUTHAMPTON  Alas my Lord the Queen's Displeasure kindles  With Warmth increasing whilst Lord  Burleigh  labours  T' inflame her Wrath and make it still burn fiercer  ESSEX  I scorn the Blaze of Courts the Pomp of Kings  I give them to the Winds and lighter Vanity  Too long they've robb'd me of substantial Bliss  Of solid Happiness and true Enjoyment  But lead me to my mourning Love alas  She sinks beneath oppressing Ills she fades  She dies for my afflicting Pangs and seeks  Me sorrowing in the Walks of Woe Distraction  O lead me to her to my Soul's Desire  SOUTHAMPTON  Let Caution guide you in this dangerous Step  Consider well my Lord the Consequence  For should the Queen forbid it Heaven discover  Your private Loves your plighted Hands no Power  On Earth could step between you and Destruction  Lock up this Secret from the prying World  Enter  BURLEIGH  BURLEIGH  My Lord of  Essex  'tis the Queen's Command  That you forthwith resign your Staff of Office  And further she confines you to your Palace  ESSEX  Welcome my Fate let Fortune do her utmost  I know the worst and will confront her Malice  And bravely bear the unexpected Blow  BURLEIGH  The Queen my Lord demands your quick Compliance  ESSEX  Go then thou gladsome Messenger of Ill  And joyful feast thy fierce rapacious Soul  With  Essex'  sudden and accomplish'd Fall  The trampled Coarse of all his envy'd Greatness  Lies prostrate now beneath thy savage Feet  But still th' exalted Spirit

Poct's Pons were Trowels  Our Man is honest sensible and plain  Nor has the Poet made him pert or vain  No Beau no Courtier nor conceited Youth  But then so rude  he always speaks the Truth  I told

for Wear  You must new  case  her  front  her and  repair  If crack'd in Fame as scarce to bear a Touch  You cannot use your  Trowel  then too much  In short whate'er her Morals Age or Station  Plaister  and  whitewash  in your Dedication  Thus I advis'dbut he detests the Plan  What can be done with such a simple Man  A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing  Unless he'll furnish where

tho' of every  Blessing  we have store  Our Sex will always wisha little more  If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty  And sell to who will buy Wit Honour Beauty  The Bricklay'r still for him
