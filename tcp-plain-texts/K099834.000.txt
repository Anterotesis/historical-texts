 ODES ON Various Subjects  EURIPIDES in Alceste  By JOSEPH WARTON B A of  Oriel  College  Oxon  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's Head in  Pallmall  and sold by M COOPER in  Paternoster Row  MDCCXLVI  Advertisement  THE Public has been so much accustom'd of late to didactic Poetry alone and Essays on moral Subjects that any work where the imagination is much indulged will perhaps not be relished or regarded The author therefore of these pieces is in some pain least certain austere critics should think them too fanciful and descriptive But as he is convinced that the fashion of moralizing in verse has been carried too far and as he looks upon Invention and Imagination to be the chief faculties of a Poet so he will be happy if the following Odes may be look'd upon as an attempt to bring back Poetry into its right channel  ODES ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS  ODE I  To FANCY  O Parent of each lovely Muse  Thy spirit o'er my soul diffuse  O'er all my artless songs preside  My footsteps to thy temple guide  To offer at thy turfbuilt shrine  In golden cups no costly wine  No murder'd fatling of the flock  But flowers and honey from the rock  O Nymph with looselyflowing hair  With buskin'd leg and bosom bare  Thy waist with myrtlegirdle bound  Thy brows with Indian feathers crown'd  Waving in thy snowy hand  An allcommanding magic wand  Of pow'r to bid fresh gardens blow  'Midst chearless Lapland's barren snow  Whose rapid wings thy flight convey  Thro' air and over earth and sea  While the vast various landscape lies  Conspicuous to thy piercing eyes  O lover of the desart hail  Say in what deep and pathless vale  Or on what hoary mountain's side  'Midst falls of water you reside  'Midst broken rocks a rugged scene  With green and grassy dales between  'Midst forests dark of aged oak  Ne'er echoing with the woodman's stroke  Where never human art appear'd  Nor ev'n one strawrooft cott was rear'd  Where NATURE seems to sit alone  Majestic on a craggy throne  Tell me the path sweet wand'rer tell  To thy unknown sequester'd cell  Where woodbines cluster round the door  Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor  And on whose top an hawthorn blows  Amid whose thicklywoven boughs  Some nightingale still builds her nest  Each evening warbling thee to rest  Then lay me by the haunted stream  Wrapt in some wild poÃ«tic dream  In converse while methinks I rove  With SPENSER thro' a fairy grove  Till suddenly awoke I hear  Strange whisper'd music in my ear  And my glad soul in bliss is drown'd  By the sweetlysoothing sound  Me Goddess by the righthand lead  Sometimes thro' the yellow mead  Where JOY and whiterob'd PEACE resort  And VENUS keeps her festive court  Where MIRTH and YOUTH each evening meet  And lightly trip with nimble feet  Nodding their lillycrowned heads  Where LAUGHTER roselip'd HEBE leads  Where ECHO walks steep hills among  List'ning to the shepherd's song  Or sometimes in thy fiery car  Transport me to the rage of war  There whirl me o'er the hills of slain  Where Tumult and Destruction reign  Where mad with pain the wounded steed  Tramples the dying and the dead  Where giant Terror stalks around  With sullen joy surveys the ground  And pointing to th' ensanguin'd field  Shakes his dreadful Gorgonshield  Then guide me from this horrid scene  To higharcht walks and alleys green  Where lovely LAURA walks to shun  The fervors of the midday sun  The pangs of absence O remove  For thou can'st place me near my love  Can'st fold in visionary bliss  And let me think I steal a kiss  While her ruby lips dispense  Luscious nectar's quintessence  When youngey'd SPRING profusely throws  From her green lap the pink and rose  When the soft turtle of the dale  To SUMMER tells her tender tale  When AUTUMN cooling caverns seeks  And stains with wine his jolly cheeks  When WINTER like poor pilgrim old  Shakes his silver beard with cold  At every season let my ear  Thy solemn whispers FANCY hear  O warm enthusiastic maid  Without thy powerful vital aid  That breathes an energy divine  That gives a soul to every line  Ne'er may I strive with lips profane  To utter an unhallow'd strain  Nor dare to touch the sacred string  Save when with smiles thou bid'st me sing  O hear our prayer O hither come  From thy lamented SHAKESPEAR'S tomb  On which thou lov'st to sit at eve  Musing o'er your darling's grave  O queen of numbers once again  Animate some chosen swain  Who fill'd with unexhausted fire  May boldly smite the sounding lyre  Who with some new unequall'd song  May rise above the rhyming throng  O'er all our list'ning passions reign  O'erwhelm our souls with joy and pain  With terror shake with pity move  Rouze with revenge or melt with love  O deign t'attend his evening walk  With him in groves and grottos talk  Teach him to scorn with frigid art  Feebly to touch th' unraptur'd heart  Like light'ning let his mighty verse  The bosom's inmost foldings pierce  With native beauties win applause  Beyond cold critic's studied laws  O let each Muse's fame encrease  O bid BRITANNIA rival GREECE  ODE II  To LIBERTY  O Goddess on whose steps attend  PLEASURE and laughterloving HEALTH  Whitemantled PEACE with olivewand  Young JOY and diamondsceptred WEALTH  Blithe PLENTY with her loaded horn  With SCIENCE bright ey'd as the morn  In Britain which for ages past  Has been thy choicest darling care  Who mad'st her wise and strong and fair  May thy best blessings ever last  For thee the pining pris'ner mourns  Depriv'd of food of mirth of light  For thee pale slaves to galleys chain'd  That ply tough oars from morn to night  Thee the proud Sultan's beauteous train  By eunuchs guarded weep in vain  Tearing the roses from their locks  And Guinea's captive kings lament  By christian lords to labour sent  Whipt like the dull unfeeling ox  Inspir'd by thee deaf to sond nature's cries  Stern BRUTUS when Rome's genius loudly call'd  Gave her the matchless filial sacrifice  Unable to behold her power enthrall'd  And he of later age but equal fame  Dar'd stab the tyrant tho' he lov'd the friend  How burnt the  Leonidas  Spartan with warm patriotflame  In thy great cause his valorous life to end  How burst GUSTAVUS from the Swedish mine  Like light from chaos dark eternally to shine  When heav'n to all thy joys bestows  And graves upon our heartsBE FREE  Shall coward man those joys resign  And dare reverse this great decree  Submit him to some idolking  Some selfish passionguided thing  Abhorring man by man abhorr'd  Around whose throne stands trembling DOUBT  Whose jealous eyes still rowl about  And MURDER with his reeking sword  Where trampling TYRANNY with FATE  And black REVENGE gigantic goes  Hark how the dying infants shriek  How hopeless age is sunk in woes  Fly mortals from that fated land  Tho' rivers rowl o'er golden sand  Tho' birds in shades of cassia sing  Harvests and fruits spontaneous rise  No storms disturb the smiling skies  And each soft breeze rich odours bring  BRITANNIA watchremember peerless ROME  Her hightow'r'd head dash'd meanly to the ground  Remember freedom's guardian GRECIA'S doom  Whom weeping the despotic Turk has bound  May ne'er thy oakcrown'd hills rich meads downs  Fame virtue courage property forgot  Thy peaceful villages and busy towns  Be doom'd some deathdispensing tyrant's lot  On deep foundations may thy freedom stand  Long as the surge shall lash thy seaencircled land  ODE III  To HEALTH  Written on a Recovery from the SMALLPOX  O Whether with laborious clowns  In meads and woods thou lov'st to dwell  In noisy merchantcrouded towns  Or in the temperate Brachman's cell  Who from the meads of Ganges' fruitful flood  Wet with sweet dews collects his flowery food  In Bath or in Montpellier's plains  Or rich Bermud s' balmy isle  Or the cold North whose furclad swains  Ne'er saw the purple Autumn smile  Who over alps of snow and desarts drear  By twinkling starlight drive the flying deer  O lovely queen of mirth and ease  Whom absent beauty banquets wine  Wit music pomp nor science please  And kings on ivory couches pine  Nature's kind nurse to whom by gracious heav'n  To sooth the pangs of toilsome life 'tis giv'n  To aid a languid wretch repair  Let paleey'd Grief thy presence fly  The restless demon gloomy Care  And meagre Melancholy die  Drive to some lonely rock the giant Pain  And bind him howling with a triple chain  O come restore my aking sight  Yet let me not on LAURA gaze  Soon must I quit that dear delight  O'erpower'd by Beauty's piercing rays  Support my feeble feet and largely shed  Thy oil of gladness on my fainting head  How nearly had my spirit past  Till stopt by METCALF'S skilful hand  To Death's dark regions wide and wast  And the black river's mournful strand  Or to those vales of joy and meadows blest  Where sages heroes patriots poets rest  Where MARO and MUSAEUS sit  List'ning to MILTON'S loftier song  With sacred silent wonder smit  While monarch of the tuneful throng  HOMER in rapture throws his trumpet down  And to the Briton gives his amaranthine crown  ODE IV  To SUPERSTITION  HENCE to some Convent's gloomy isles  Where chearful daylight never smiles  Tyrant from Albion haste to slavish Rome  There by dim tapers' livid light  At the still solemn hours of night  In pensive musings walk o'er many a sounding tomb  Thy clanking chains thy crimson steel  Thy venom'd darts and barbarous wheel  Malignant fiend bear from this isle away  Nor dare in error's fetters bind  One active sreeborn British mind  That strongly strives to spring indignant from thy sway  Thou bad'st grim MOLOCH'S frowning priest  Snatch screaming infants from the breast  Regardless of the frantick mother's woes  Thou led'st the ruthless sons of Spain  To wond'ring India's golden plain  From deluges of blood where tenfold harvests rose  But lo how swiftly art thou fled  When REASON lifts his radiant head  When his resounding awful voice they hear  Blind IGNORANCE thy doating sire  Thy daughter trembling FEAR retire  And all thy ghastly train of terrors disappear  So by the Magi hail'd from far  When PHOEBUS mounts his early car  The shrieking ghosts to their dark charnels flock  The fullgorg'd wolves retreat no more  The prowling lionesses roar  But hasten with their prey to some deepcavern'd rock  Hail then ye friends of Reason hail  Ye foes to Myst'ry's odious veil  To Truth's high temple guide my steps aright  Where CLARKE and WOOLASTON reside  With LOCKE and NEWTON by their side  While PLATO sits above enthron'd in endless light  ODE V  To a GENTLEMAN upon his Travels thro'  Italy  WHILE I with fond officious care  For you my chorded shell prepare  And not unmindful frame an humble lay  Where shall this verse my CYNNTHIO find  What scene of art now charms your mind  Say on what sacred spot of Roman ground you stray  Perhaps you cull each valley's bloom  To strew o'er VIRGIL'S laurell'd tomb  Whence oft at midnight echoing voices sound  For at that hour of silence there  The shades of ancient bards repair  To join in choral song his hallow'd urn around  Or wander in the cooling shade  Of Sabine bow'rs where HORACE stray'd  And oft' repeat in eager thought elate  As round in classic search you trace  With curious eye the pleasing place  This fount he lov'd and there beneath that oak he sate  How longs my raptur'd breast with you  Great RAPHAEL'S magic strokes to view  To whose blest hand each charm the Graces gave  Whence each fair form with beauty glows  Like that of VENUS when she rose  Naked in blushing charms from OCEAN'S hoary wave  As oft by roving fancy led  To smooth CLITUMNUS' banks you tread  What awful thoughts his fabled waters raise  While the lowthoughted swain whose flock  Grazes around from some steep rock  With vulgar disregard his mazy course surveys  Now thro' the ruin'd domes my Muse  Your steps with eager flight pursues  That their cleft piles on TYBER'S plains present  Among whose hollowwinding cells  Forlorn and wild ROME'S GENIUS dwells  His golden sceptre broke and purple mantle rent  Oft to those mossy mould'ring walls  Those caverns dark and silent halls  Let me repair by midnight's paly fires  There muse on Empire's fallen state  And frail Ambition's hapless fate  While more than mortal thoughts the solemn scene inspires  What lust of power from the cold North  Could tempt those Vandalrobbers sorth  Fair ITALY thy vineclad vales to wast  Whose hands profane with hostile blade  Thy story'd temples dar'd invade  And all thy Parian seats of Attic art defac'd  They weeping ART in fetters bound  And gor'd her breast with many a wound  And veil'd her charms in clouds of thickest night  Sad POESY muchinjur'd maid  They drove to some dim convent's shade  And quench'd in gloomy mist her lamp's resplendent light  There long she wept to darkness doom'd  'Till COSMO'S hand her light relum'd  That once again in lofty TASSO shone  Since has sweet SPENSER caught her fire  She breath'd once more in MILTON'S lyre  And warm'd the soul divine of SHAKESPEAR fancy's son  Nor she mild queen will cease to smile  On her BRITANNIA'S muchlov'd isle  Where these her best her favourite Three were born  While  The author of the  Pleasures of Imagination  THERON warbles Grecian strains  Or polish'd DODINGTON remains  The drooping train of art  to cherish and adorn  ODE VI  Against DESPAIR  FArewell thou dimpled cherub JOY  Thou rosecrown'd eversmiling boy  Wont thy sister HOPE to lead  To dance along the primrose mead  No more bereft of happy hours  I seek thy luteresounding bow'rs  But to yon' ruin'd tower repair  To meet the god of Groans DESPAIR  Who on that ivydarken'd ground  Still takes at eve his silent round  Or sits yon' newmade grave beside  Where lies a frantic suicide  While lab'ring sighs my heartstrings break  Thus to the sullen power I speak  " Haste with thy poison'd dagger haste  " To pierce this sorrowladen breast  " Or lead me at the dead of night  " To some seabeat mountain's height  " Whence with headlong haste I'll leap  " To the dark bosom of the deep  " Or shew me far from human eye  " Some cave to muse in starve and die  " No weeping friend or brother near  " My last fond fault'ring words to hear  'Twas thus with weights of woes opprest  I sought to ease my bruised breast  When straight more gloomy grew the shade  And lo a tall majestic maid  Her limbs not delicately fair  Robust and of a martial air  She bore of steel a polish'd shield  Where highlysculptur'd I beheld  Socrates  Th' Athenian martyr smiling stand  The baleful goblet in his hand  Sparkled her eyes with lively flame  And PATIENCE was the Seraph's name  Sternly she look'd and stern began  " Thy sorrows cease complaining man  " Rouze thy weak soul appease thy moan  " Soon are the clouds of sadness gone  " Tho' now in Grief's dark groves you walk  " Where griesly fiends around you stalk  " Beyond a blissful city lies  " Far from whose gates each anguish flies  " Take thou this shield which once of yore  " ULYSSES and ALCIDES wore  " And which in later days I gave  " To REGULUS and RALEIGH brave  " In exile or in dungeon drear  " Their mighty minds could banish fear  " Thy heart no tenfold woes shall feel  " 'Twas VIRTUE temper'd the rough steel  " And by her heavenly fingers wrought  " To me the precious present brought  ODE VII  To EVENING  HAIL meekey'd maiden clad in sober grey  Whose soft approach the weary woodman loves  As homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes  He jocund whistles thro' the twilight groves  When PHOEBUS sinks behind the gilded hills  You lightly o'er the misty meadows walk  The drooping daisies bathe in honeydews  And nurse the nodding violet's slender stalk  The panting Dryads that in day's fierce heat  To inmost bowers and cooling caverns ran  Return to trip in wanton eveningdance  Old SYLVAN too returns and laughing PAN  To the deep wood the clamorous rooks repair  Light skims the swallow o'er the wat'ry scene  And from the sheepcotes and freshfurrow'd field  Stout plowmen meet to wrestle on the green  The swain that artless sings on yonder rock  His supping sheep and lengthening shadow spies  Pleas'd with the cool the calm refreshful hour  And with hoarse hummings of unnumber'd flies  Now every passion sleeps desponding Love  And pining Envy everrestless Pride  An holy calm creeps o'er my peaceful soul  Anger and mad Ambition's storms subside  O modest EVENING oft' let me appear  A wandering votary in thy pensive train  List'ning to every wildlywarbling throat  That fills with farewell notes the dark'ning plain  ODE VIII  To a FOUNTAIN  Imitated from HORACE Ode XIII Book III  YE waves that gushing fall with purest stream  Blandusian Fount to whom the products sweet  Of richest vines belong  And fairest flowers of spring  To thee a chosen victim will I slay  A kid who glowing in lascivious youth  Just blooms with budding horn  And with vain thought elate  Yet destines future war but ah too soon  His reeking blood with crimson shall enrich  Thy pure translucent flood  And tinge thy crystal clear  Thy sweet recess the sun in midday hour  Can ne'er invade thy streams the labour'd ox  Refresh with cooling draught  And glad the wand'ring herds  Thy name shall shine with endless honors grac'd  While on my shell I sing the nodding oak  That o'er thy cavern deep  Waves his embowering head  ODE IX  To the NIGHTINGALE  O Thou that to the moonlight vale  Warblest oft thy plaintive tale  What time the villagemurmurs cease  And the still eve is hush'd to peace  When now no busy sound is heard  CONTEMPLATION'S favourite bird  Chauntress of night whose amorous song  First heard the tufted groves among  Warns wanton MABBA to begin  Her revels on the circled green  Whene'er by MEDITATION led  I nightly seek some distant mead  A short repose of cares to find  And sooth my lovedistracted mind  O fail not then sweet PHILOMEL  Thy sadlywarbled woes to tell  In sympathetic numbers join  Thy pangs of luckless love with mine  So may no swain's rude hand infest  Thy tender young and rob thy nest  Nor ruthless fowler's guileful snare  Lure thee to leave the fields of air  No more to visit vale or shade  Some barbarous virgin's captive made  ODE X  On the SPRING  To a LADY  LO SPRING array'd in primrosecolour'd robe  Fresh beauties sheds on each enliven'd scene  With show'rs and sunshine chears the smiling globe  And mantles hill and vale in glowing green  All nature feels her vital heat around  The pregnant glebe now bursts with foodful grain  With kindly warmth she opes the frozen ground  And with new life informs the teeming plain  She calls the fishes from their ouzy beds  And animates the deep with genial love  She bids the herds bound sportive o'er the meads  And with glad songs awakes the joyous grove  No more the glaring tiger roams for prey  Allpowerful Love subdues his savage soul  To find his spotted mate he darts away  While gentler thoughts the thirst of blood controul  But ah while all is warmth and soft desire  While all around SPRING'S chearful influence own  You feel not AMORET her quickening fire  To SPRING'S kind heat of all a foe alone  ODE XI  To a LADY who hates the Country  NOW SUMMER daughter of the Sun  O'er the gay fields comes dancing on  And earth o'erflows with joys  Too long in routs and drawingrooms  The tasteless hours my fair consumes  'Midst folly flattery noise  Come hear mild ZEPHYR bid the rose  Her balmybreathing buds disclose  Come hear the falling rill  Observe the honeyloaded bee  The beechembower'd cottage see  Beside yon' sloping hill  By health awoke at early morn  We'll brush sweet dews from every thorn  And help unpen the fold  Hence to yon' hollow oak we'll stray  Where dwelt as villagefables say  An holy DRUID old  Come wildly rove thro' desart dales  To listen how lone nightingales  In liquid lays complain  Adieu the tender thrilling note  That pants in MONTICELLI'S throat  And HANDEL'S stronger strain  " Insipid pleasures these you cry  " Must I from dear Assemblies fly  " To see rude peasants toil  " For Opera's listen to a bird  " Shall  Arcadia  SYDNEY'S fables be preferr'd  " To my sagacious  Alluding to those Ladies who have left their Novels and Romances for the profound study of Mr HOYLE'S book on  Whist  HOYLE  O falsly fond of what seems great  Of purple pomp and robes of state  And all life's tinsel glare  Rather with humble violets bind  Or give to wanton in the wind  Your length of sable hair  Soon as you reach the rural shade  Will MIRTH the sprightly mountainmaid  Your days and nights attend  She'll bring fantastic SPORT and SONG  Nor CUPID will be absent long  Your true ally and friend  ODE XII  On the Death of  NO more of mirth and rural joys  The gay description quickly cloys  In melting numbers sadly slow  I tune my alter'd strings to woe  Attend MELPOMENE and with thee bring  Thy tragic lute EUPHRANOR'S death to sing  Fond wilt thou be his name to praise  For oft' thou heard'st his skilful lays  ISIS for him soft tears has shed  She plac'd her ivy on his head  Chose him strict judge to rule with steddy reigns  The vigorous fancies of her listening swains  With genius wit and science blest  Unshaken Honour arm'd his breast  Bade him with virtuous courage wise  Malignant FORTUNE'S darts despise  Him ev'n black ENVY'S venom'd tongues commend  As Scholar Pastor Husband Father Friend  For ever sacred ever dear  O muchlov'd shade accept this tear  Each night indulging pious woe  Fresh roses on thy tomb I strew  And wish for tender SPENSER'S moving verse  Warbled in broken sobs o'er SYDNEY'S herse  Let me to that deep cave resort  Where SORROW keeps her silent court  For ever wringing her pale hands  While dumb MISFORTUNE near her stands  With downcast eyes the CARES around her wait  And PITY sobbing sits before the gate  Thus stretch'd upon his grave I sung  When strait my ears with murmur rung  A distant deaf and hollow sound  Was heard in solemn whispers round  " Weep not for me embath'd in bliss above  " In the bright kingdoms blest of joy and love  ODE XIII  On SHOOTING  NYMPHS of the forests that young oaks protect  From noxious blasts and the blue thunder's dart  O how securely might ye dwell  In Britain's peaceful shades  Far from grim wolves or tiger's midnight roar  Or crimsoncrested serpent's hungry hiss  But that our savage swains pollute  With murder your retreats  How oft' your birds have undeserving bled  Linnet or warbling thrush or moaning dove  Pleasant with gaylyglist'ring wings  Or earlymounting lark  While in sweet converse in a round you sit  On the green turf or in the woodbinebower  If chance the thund'ring Gun be heard  To grots and caves ye run  Fearful as when LODONA fled from PAN  Or DAPHNE panting from enamour'd SOL  Or fair SABRINA to the flood  Her snowy beauties gave  When will dread Man his Tyrannies forego  When cease to bathe his barbarous hands in blood  His subjects helpless harmless weak  Delighting to destroy  More pleasant far to shield their tender young  From churlish swains that violate their nests  And wand'ring morn or eve to hear  Their welcome to the Spring  ODE XIV  To SOLITUDE  THOU that at deep dead of night  Walk'st forth beneath the pale moon's light  In robe of flowing black array'd  While cypressleaves thy brows o'ershade  List'ning to the crowing cock  And the distantsounding clock  Or sitting in thy cavern low  Do'st hear the bleak winds loudly blow  Or the hoarse deathboding owl  Or village maistiff's wakeful howl  While through thy melancholy room  A dim lamp casts an awful gloom  Thou that on the meadow green  Or daisy'd upland art not seen  But wand'ring by the dusky nooks  And the pensivefalling brooks  Or near some rugged herbless rock  Where no shepherd keeps his flock  Musing maid to thee I come  Hating the tradeful city's hum  O let me calmly dwell with thee  From noisy mirth and bus'ness free  With meditation seek the skies  This follyfetter'd world despise  FINIS
