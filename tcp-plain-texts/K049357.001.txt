 THE ADVENTURES OF  Roderick Random  Et genus virtus nisi cum re vilior alga est  HOR  In TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON Printed for J OSBORN in PaternosterRow MDCCXLVIII  THE PREFACE  OF all kinds of satire there is none so entertaining and universally improving as that which is introduced as it were occasionally in the course of an interesting story which brings every incident home to life and by representing familiar scenes in an uncommon and amusing point of view invests them with all the graces of novelty while nature is appealed to in every particular  The reader gratifies his curiosity in pursuing the adventures of a person in whose favour he is prepossessed he espouses his cause he sympathizes with him in distress his indignation is heated against the authors of his calamity the humane passions are inflamed the contrast between dejected virtue and insulting vice appears with greater aggravation and every impression having a double force on the imagination the memory retains the circumstance and the heart improves by the example The attention is not tired with a bare Catalogue of characters but agreeably diverted with all the variety of invention and the vicissitudes of life appear in their peculiar circumstances opening an ample field for wit and humour  Romance no doubt owes its origin to ignorance vanity and superstition In the dark ages of the world when a man had rendered himself famous for wisdom or valour  his family and adherents availed themselves of his superior qualities magnified his virtues and represented his character and person as sacred and supernatural The vulgar easily swallowed the bait implored his protection and yielded the tribute of homage and praise even to adoration his exploits were handed down to posterity with a thousand exaggerations they were repeated as incitements to virtue divine honours were paid and altars erected to his memory for the encouragement of those who attempted to imitate his example and hence arose the heathen mythology which is no other than a collection of extravagant RomancesAs learning advanced and genius received cultivation these stories were embellished with the graces of poetry that they might the better recommend themselves to the attention they were sung in publick at festivals for the instruction and delight of the audience and rehearsed before battle as incentives to deeds of glory Thus tragedy and the  epic muse were born and in the progress of taste arrived at perfectionIt is no wonder that the ancients could not relish a fable in prose after they had seen so many remarkable events celebrated in verse by their best poets we therefore find no romance among them during the aera of their excellence unless the Cyropaedia of Zenophon may be so called and it was not till arts and sciences began to revive after the irruption of the Barbarians into Europe that any thing of this kind appeared But when the minds of men were debauched by the imposition of priestcraft to the most absurd pitch of credulity the authors of romance arose and losing sight of probability filled their performances with the most monstrous hyperboles If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius they were resolved to excel them in fiction and apply to the wonder rather than the judgment of their readers Accordingly they brought negromancy to their aid and instead of supporting the character  of their heroes by dignity of sentiment and practice distinguished them by their bodily strength activity and extravagance of behaviour Although nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural than the figures they drew they did not want patrons and admirers and the world actually began to be infected with the spirit of knighterrantry when Cervantes by an inimitable piece of ridicule reformed the taste of mankind representing chivalry in the right point of view and converting romance to purposes far more useful and entertaining by making it assume the sock and point out the follies of ordinary life  The same method has been practised by other Spanish and French authors and by none more successfully than by Monsieur Le Sage who in his adventures of Gil Blas has described the knavery and foibles of life with infinite humour and sagacityThe following sheets I have modelled on his plan taking the liberty however to  differ from him in the execution where I thought his particular situations were uncommon extravagant or peculiar to the country in which the scene is laidThe disgraces of Gil Blas are for the most part such as rather excite mirth than compassion he himself laughs at them and his transitions from distress to happiness or at least ease are so sudden that neither the reader has time to pity him nor himself to be acquainted with afflictionThis conduct in my opinion not only deviates from probability but prevents that generous indignation which ought to animate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the world  I have attempted to represent modest merit struggling with every difficulty to which a friendless orphan is exposed from his own want of experience as well as from the selfishness envy malice and base indifference of mankindTo secure a favourable prepossession I have allowed him the advantages of birth and education  which in the series of his misfortunes will I hope engage the ingenuous more warmly in his behalf and though I foresee that some people will be offended at the mean scenes in which he is involved I persuade myself the judicious will not only perceive the necessity of describing those situations to which he must of course be confined in his low estate but also find entertainment in viewing those parts of life where the humours and passions are undisguised by affectation ceremony or education and the whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear as nature has implanted themBut I believe I need not trouble myself in vindicating a practice authorized by the best writers in this way some of whom I have already named  Every intelligent reader will at first sight perceive I have not deviated from nature in the facts which are all true in the main although the circumstances are  altered and disguised to avoid personal satire  It now remains to give my reasons for making the chief personage of this work a NorthBriton which are chiefly these I could at a small expence bestow on him such education as I thought the dignity of his birth and character required which could not possibly be obtained in England by such slender means as the nature of my plan would afford In the next place I could represent simplicity of manners in a remote part of the kingdom with more propriety than in any place near the capital and lastly the disposition of the Scots addicted to travelling justifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that country  That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning oaths which proceed from the mouths of some persons in these memoirs I beg leave to premise  that I imagined nothing could more effectually expose the absurdity of such miserable expletives than a natural and verbal representation of the discourse with which they are commonly interlarded  THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  CHAP I Of my birth and parentage page  CHAP II I grow upam hated by my relationssent to schoolneglected by my

grandfather a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence who had on many occasions signalized himself in behalf of his country and was remarkable for his abilities in the law which he exercised with great success in quality of a judge particularly against beggars for whom he had a singular aversion  My father his youngest son sell in love with a poor relation who lived with the old gentleman and performed the office of housekeeper whom he privately espoused of which marriage I am the first fruitDuring her pregnancy a dream discomposed my mother so much that my  father tired with her importunity at last consulted a seer whose favourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a bribe but found him incorruptible She dreamed she was delivered of a tennisball which the devil who to her great surprize acted the part of a midwife struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared in an instant and she was for some time inconsolable for the loss of her offspring when all of a sudden she beheld it return with equal violence and earth itself beneath her feet whence immediately sprung up a goodly tree covered with blossoms the scent of which operated so strongly on her nerves that she awokeThe attentive sage after some deliberation assured my parents that their firstborn would be a great traveller that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties and at last return to his native land where he would flourish with great reputation and happinessHow truly this was foretold will appear in the sequelIt was not long before some officious person informed my grandfather of familiarities that passed between his son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that a few days after he told my father it was high time for him to enter into the holy state of matrimony and that he had provided a match for him to which he could in justice have no objections My father finding it would be impossible to conceal his situation much longer frankly owned what he had done and excused himself for not having asked the consent of his father by saying he knew it would be to no purpose and that had his inclination been known my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have effectually put the gratification  of it out of his power he added that no exception could be made to his wife's virtue birth beauty and good sense and as for fortune it was beneath his considerationThe old gentleman who kept all his passions except one in excellent order heard him to an end with great temper and then calmly asked how he proposed to maintain himself and spouseHe replied he could be in no danger of wanting while his father's tenderness remained which he and his wife would always cherish with the utmost veneration that he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity and circumstances of his family and the provision already made to his brothers and sisters who were happily settled under his protectionYour brothers and sisters said my grandfather did not think it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony neither I suppose would you have omitted that piece of duty had you not some secret fund in reserve to the comforts of which I leave you with a desire that you will this night seek out another habitation for yourself and wife whither in a short time I will send you an account of the  pence I have been at in your education with a view of being reimbursedSir you have made the grand touryou are a polite gentlemana very pretty gentlemanI wish you a great deal of joy and am your very humble servant So saying he left my father in a situation easily imagined However he did not long hesitate for lbeing perfectly well acquainted with his father's disposition he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him and as his resolves were invariable like the laws of the Medes and Persians he knew  it would be to no purpose to attempt him by prayers and intreaties so without any farther application he betook himself with his disconsolate bedfellow to a farmhouse where an old servant of his mother dwelt there they remained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and tenderness of their love which nevertheless my father endured rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent but my mother foreseeing the inconveniencies she would be exposed to if she must be delivered in this place and her pregnancy was very far advanced without communicating her design to her husband went in disguise to the house of my grandfather hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compassion and reconcile him to an event which could not otherwise be amendedShe found means to deceive the servants and was introduced as an unfortunate lady who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances it being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all cases of scandal She was accordingly admitted into his presence where discovering herself she sell at his seet and in the most affecting manner implored his forgiveness at the same time representing the danger that threatned not only her life but that of his own grandchild which was about to see the lightHe told her he was sorry that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to make a vow which put it out of his power to give them any assistanceThat he had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her husband and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any further importunityThis said he retiredThe violence of  my mother's affliction had such an effect on her constitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of childbed and had not an old maidservant to whom she was very dear afforded her pity and assistance at the hazard of incurring my grandfather's displeasure she and the innocent fruit of her womb must have fallen miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanityBy the friendship of this poor woman she was carried up to a garret and immediately delivered of a manchild the story of whose unfortunate birth he himself now relatesMy father being informed of what had happened flew to the embraces of his darling spouse and while he loaded his off spring with paternal caresses could not forbear shedding a flood of tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart for whose ease he would have sacrificed the treasures of the east stretched upon a flockbed in a miserable apartment unable to protect her from the inclemencies of the weatherIt is not to be supposed that the old gentleman was ignorant of what passed tho' he affected to know nothing of the matter and pretended to be very much surprized when the son of his deceased eldest son a pert boy who lived with him as his heir apparent acquainted him with the affair he determined therefore to preserve no medium but immediately on the third day after her delivery sent her a peremptory order to begone and turned off the servant who had preserved her life This behaviour so exasperated my father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations and on his bare knees implored that heaven would renounce him if ever he should forget or forgive the barbarity of his fireThe injuries  which this unhappy mother received from her removal in such circumstances and the want of necessaries where she lodged together with her grief and anxiety of mind soon threw her into a languishing disorder which put an end to her life My father who loved her tenderly was so affected with her death that he remained six weeks deprived of his senses during which time the people where he lodged carried the infant to the old man who relented so far on hearing the melancholy story of his daughterinlaw's death and the deplorable condition of his son that he sent the child to nurse and ordered my father to be carried home to his house where he soon recovered the use of his reasonWhether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment of his son and daughter or which is more probable was afraid his character would suffer in the neighbourhood he professed great sorrow for his conduct to my father whose delirium was succeeded by a profound melancholy and reserve At length he disappeared and notwithstanding all imaginable inquiry could never be heard of which confirmed most people in the opinion of his having made away with himself in a fit of despairHow I understood the particulars of my birth will appear in the course of these memoirs  CHAP II  I grew upam hated by my relationssent to schoolneglected by my grandfathermaltreated by my masterseasoned to adversityform cabals against the pedantdebarred access to my grandfatherhunted by his heirdemolish the teeth of his tutor  THERE were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned in my father's fate on the supposition that they would all share in the patrimony destined for him and this conjecture seemed supported by reflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least inclination to serve him but on the contrary by all the artifices in their power fed his father's resentment and strengthened his resolution of leaving him to misery and wantBut people of judgment treated this insinuation as an idle chimera because had my relations been so wicked as to consult their interest by committing such an attrocious crime the fate of my father would have extended to me too whose life was another obstacle to their expectationMean while I grew apace and as I strongly resembled my father who was the darling of the tenants I wanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford but their favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my cousins who the more my infancy promised conceived  the more implacable hatred against me and before I was six years of age had so effectually blockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by stealth when I sometimes made up to his chair as he fat to view his labourers in the field on which occasions he would stroak my head bid me be a good boy and promise he would take care of meI was soon after sent to school at a village hard by of which he had been dictator time out of mind but as he neither paid for my board nor supplied me with clothes books and other necessaries I required my condition was very ragged and contemptible and the schoolmaster who through fear of my grandfather taught me  gratis  gave himself no concern about the progress I made under his instructionIn spite of all these difficulties and disgraces I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue and as soon as I could write tolerably pestered my grandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master and chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education telling him that if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery which he had taught me to commit my blood should lie on his headThe pedant who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his patron assured his honour that the boy's ability was more owing to his own genius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he received that although he could not divest him of the knowledge he had already imbibed unless he would impower him to disable his fingers he should endeavour with Gd's help to prevent his future improvement And indeed he punctually performed what he he had undertaken for on pretence that I had  wrote impertinent letters to my grandfather he caused a board to be made with five holes in it through which he thrust the fingers and thumb of my right hand and fastened it by whipcord to my wrist in such a manner that I was effectually debarr'd the use of my pen But this restraint I was freed from in a few days by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy who taking upon him to insult my poverty I was so incensed at this ungenerous reproach that with one stroke of my machine I cut him to the skull to the great terror of myself and schoolfellows who left him bleeding on the ground and ran to inform the master of what had happened I was so severely punished for this trespass that were I to live to the age of Methusalem the impression it made on me would not be effaced no more than the antipathy and horror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who inflicted it The contempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who saw me the continual wants I was exposed to and my own haughty disposition impatient of affronts involved me in a thousand troublesome adventures by which I was at length enured to adversity and emboldened to undertakings far above my years I was often inhumanly scourged for crimes I did not commit because having the character of a vagabond in the village every piece of mischief whose author lay unknown was charged upon meI have been found guilty of robbing orchards I never entered of killing cats I never hurted of stealing gingerbread I never touched and of abusing old women I never sawNay a stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master that I fired a  pistol loaded with small shot into his window though my landlady and the whole family bore witness that I was abed fast asleep at the time when this outrage was committedI was flogged for having narrowly escaped drowning by the sinking of a ferryboat in which I was passengerAnother time for having recovered of a bruise occasioned by a horse and cart running over meA third time for being bit by a baker's dogIn short whether I was guilty or unfortunate the vengeance and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same Far from being subdued by this insernal usage my indignation triumphed over that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience and the more my years and knowledge increased the more I perceived the injustice and barbarity of his behaviour By the help of an uncommon genius and the advice and direction of our usher who had served my father in his travels I made a surprising progress in the classicks writing and arithmetick so that before I was twelve years old I was confessedly the best scholar in the school This qualification together with a boldness of temper and strength of make which had subjected almost all my cotemporaries gave me such influence over them that I began to form cabals against my persecutor and was in hopes of being able to bid him defiance in a very short timeBeing at the head of a faction consisting of thirty boys most of them of my own age I was determined to put their mettal to trial that I might know how far they were to be depended upon before I put my grand scheme in execution with this view we attacked a body of stout apprentices who had taken possession of a part of the ground allotted  to us for the scene of our diversions and who were then playing at ninepins on the spot but I had the mortification to see my adherents routed in an instant and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl which one of our adversaries had detached in pursuit of usThis discomfiture did not hinder us from engaging them afterwards in frequent skirmishes which we maintained by throwing stones at a distance wherein I received many wounds the sears of which still remain Our enemies were so harassed and interrupted by these alarms that they at last abandoned their conquest and left us to the peaceable enjoyment of our own territoriesIt would be endless to enumerate the exploits we performed in the course of this consederacy which became the terror of the whole village insomuch that when different interests divided it one of the parties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random by which name I was known to cast the balance and keep the opposite section in aweMeanwhile I took the advantage of every playday to present myself before my grandfather to whom I seldom found access by reason of his being so closely besieged by a numerous family of his female grandchildren who though they perpetually quarrelled among themselves never failed to join against me as the common enemy of all His heir who was about the age of eighteen minded nothing but foxhunting and indeed was qualified for nothing else notwithstanding his grandfather's indulgence in entertaining a tutor for him at home who at the same time performed the office of parish clerk This young Acteon who inherited his grandfather's antipathy to every  thing in distress never set eyes on me without uncoupling his beagles and hunting me into some cottage or other whither I generally fled for shelter In this christian amusement he was encouraged by his preceptor who no doubt took such opportunities to ingratiate himself with the rising sun observing that the old gentleman according to course of nature had not long to live being already on the verge of fourscoreThe behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much that one day when I was beleagured by him and his hounds into a farmer's house where I had found protection I took aim at him being an excellent marksman with a large pebble which struck out four of his foreteeth and effectually incapacitated him for doing the office of a clerk ever after  CHAP III  My mother's brother arrivesrelieves mea description of himgoes along with me to the house of my grandfatheris encountered by his dogsdefeats them after a bloody engagementis admitted to the old gentlemana dialogue between them  ABOUT this time my mother's only brother who had been long abroad lieutenant of a man of war arrived in his own country where being informed of my condition he came to see me and out of his slender finances not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the present but resolved not to leave the  country until he had prevailed on my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future This was a task to which he was by no means equal being entirely ignorant not only of the judge's disposition but also unacquainted with the ways of men in general to which his education on board had kept him an utter strangerHe was a strong built man somewhat bandylegged with a neck like that of a bull and a face which you might easily perceive had withstood the most obstinate assaults of the weatherHis dress consisted of a soldier's coat altered for him by the ship's taylor a stripped flannel jacket a pair of red breeches japanned with pitch clean grey worsted stockings large silver buckles that covered threefourths of his shoes a silverlaced hat whose crown overlooked the brims about an inch and a half a black bob wig in the buckle a check shirt a silk handkerchief an hanger with a brass handle girded to his thigh by a tarnished laced belt and a good oak plant under his armThus equipt he set out with me who by his bounty made a very decent appearance for my grandfather's house where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar whom my cousin young master had let loose at our approach Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of these curs I was about to betake myself to my heels when my uncle seizing me with one hand brandished his cudgel with the other and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the ground but finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by Jowler and fearing Caesar might recover he drew his hanger wheel'd about and by a lucky stroke severed Jowler's head from his bodyBy this time the young foxhunter and  three servants armed with pitchforks and flails were come to the assistance of the dogs whom they found breathless upon the field My cousin was so provoked at the death of his favourites that he ordered his attendants to advance and take vengeance on their executioner whom he loaded with all the curses and reproaches his anger could suggestUpon which my uncle stepped forwards with an undaunted air at the sight of whose bloody weapon his antagonists fell back with precipitation when he accosted their leader thus  "Lookée brother your dogs having boarded me without provocation what I did was in my own desenceSo you had best be civil and let us shoot ahead clear of you"  Whether the young 'squire misinterpreted my uncle's desire of peace or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch of resolution I know not but he snatched a flall from one of his followers and came up with a shew of assaulting the lieutenant who putting himself into a posture of defence proceeded thus  "Lookée you lubberly son of a we if you come athwart me 'ware your gingerbreadworkI'll be foul of your quarter dn me"  This declaration followed by a slourish of his hanger seemed to check the progress of the young gentleman's choler who upon turning about perceived his attendants had slunk into the house shut the gate and left him to decide the contention by himselfHere a parley ensued which was introduced by my cousin's asking  "Who the dl are youWhat do you wantSome scoundrel of a seaman I suppose who has deserted and turned thiefBut don't think you shall escape sirrahI'll have  you hanged you dogI willYour blood shall pay for that of my two hounds you ragamuffinI would not have parted with them to save your whole generation from the gallows you ruffian you"  "None of your jaw you swabnone of your jaw replied my uncle else I shall trim your laced jacket for youI shall rub you down with an oaken towel my boyI shall"  So saying he sheathed his hanger and grasped his cudgel Meanwhile the people of the house being alarm'd one of my female cousins opened a window and asked what was the matter  "The matter answered the lieutenant no great matter young womanI have business with the old gentleman and this spark belike won't allow me to come along side of him that's all"  After a few minutes pause we were admitted and conducted to my grandfather's chamber through a lane of my relations who honoured me with very significant looks as I passed alongWhen we came into the judge's presence my uncle after two or three seabows expressed himself in this manner  "Your servant your servantWhat chear father what chearI suppose you don't know memay hap you don'tMy name is Tom Bowlingand this here boy you look as if you did not know him neither'tis like you mayn'tHe's newrigged i' faithhis cloth don't shake in the wind so much as it wont to do'Tis my nephew d'ye see Roderick Randomyour own flesh and blood old gentleman don't lag a stern you dog don't pulling me forward"  My grandfather who was laidup with the gout received this relation after his  long absence with that civility and coldness which was peculiar to him told him he was glad to see him and desired him to sit down  "Thank ye thank ye sir I had as lief stand said my uncle for my own part I desire nothing of you but if you have any conscience at all do something for this poor boy who has been used at a very unchristian rateUnchristian do I call itI am sure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to leave their little ones to misery and wantI would fain know why my sister's son is more neglected than that there Fairweather Jack"  pointing to the young 'squire who with the rest of my cousins had followed us into the room  "Is he not as near akin to you as the otherIs not he much handsomer and better built than that great chuckleheadCome come consider old gentleman you are going in a short time to give an account of your evil actionsRemember the wrongs you did his father and make all the sati  faction in your power before it be too lateThe least thing you can do is to settle his father's portion on him"  The young ladies who thought themselves too much concerned to contain themselves any longer set up their throats altogether against my protector who stopped his ears with his fingers and cried out that all the devils in hell had broke loose upon him  "Scurvy companionsawcy tarpawlinrude impertinent fellow did he think to prescribe to grandpapaHis sister's brat had been too well taken care ofGrandpapa was too just not to make a difference between an unnatural rebellious son and his dutiful loving children who took his advice  in all things"  and such expressions were levelled against him with great violence until the judge at length commanded silenceHe calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour which he said he would excuse on account of his education he told him he had been very kind to the boy whom he had kept at school seven or eight years although he was informed he made no progress in his learning but was addicted to all manner of vice which he the rather believed because he himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief he had committed on the jaws of his chaplainBut however he would see what the lad was fit for and bind him apprentice to some honest tradesman or other provided he would mend his manners and behave for the future as became himThe honest tar whose pride and indignation boiled within him answered my grandfather that it was true he had sent him to school but it had cost him nothing for he had never been at one shilling expence to furnish him with food raiment books or other necessaries so that it was not to be much wondered at if the boy made small progress and yet whoever told him so was guilty of a damn'd lie for he was allowed by those who understood those matters to be the best scholar of his age in all the country the truth of which he would maintain by laying a wager of his whole half year's pay on the boy's headwith these words he pulled out his purse and challenged the companyNeither is he addicted to vice as you affirm but very much exposed to ill usage by your neglect on which occasions d'ye see he never fails to shew his spirit which has been misrepresented to youAs for what  happened to your chaplain I am only sorry that he did not knock out the scoundrel's brains instead of his teethBy the Lord if ever I come up with him he had better be in Greenlandthat's allThank you for your courteous offer of binding the lad apprentice to a tradesman I suppose you would make a taylor of himwould youI had rather see him hang'd d'ye seeCome along Rory I perceive how the land lies my boylet's tack about i' faithwhile I have a shilling thou shan't want a testerB'wye old gentleman you're bound for the other world but I believe damnably ill provided for the voyageThus ended our visit and we returned to the village my uncle muttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry that surrounded him  CHAP IV  My grandfather makes his willOur second visithe dieshis will is read in presence of all his living descendantsthe disappointment of my female cousinsmy uncle's behaviour  A FEW weeks after our first visit we were informed that the old judge after a fit of thoughtfulness which lasted three days had sent for a notary and made his will that the distemper had mounted from his legs to his stomach and being conscious of his approaching end he had desired to see all his descendants without exceptionIn obedience to this summons my  uncle set out with me a second time to receive the last benediction of my grandfather often repeating by the road  "Ey ey we have brought up the old hulk at lastYou shall seeyou shall see the effect of my admonition"  When we entered his chamber which was crowded with his relations we advanced to the bedside where we sound him in his last agonies supported by two of his granddaughters who sat on each side of him fobbing most piteously and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his lips which they frequently kissed with a shew of great anguish and affectionI know not whether or not he perceived my uncle who approached him with these words  "What he's not a weighHow fare yehow fare ye old gentlemanLord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul"  But the dying man turned his sunken eyes towards uswhen my uncle went on  "Here's poor Rory come to see you before you die and receive your blessingWhat man don't despairyou have been a great sinner 'tis truewhat then There's a righteous judge aboveisn't there He minds me no more than a porpussYes yes he's a goingthe land crabs will have him I see thathis anchor's a peak i' faith"  This homely consolation scandalized the company so much and especially the parson who probably thought his province invaded that we were obliged to retire into another room where in a few minutes we were convinced of my grandfather's decease by a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment whither we immediately hastened and found his heir who had retired a little  before into a closet under pretence of giving vent to his sorrow asking with a countenance beslubbered with tears if his grandpapa was certainly dead  "Dead says my uncle looking at the body ay ay I'll warrant him as dead as a herringOdd's fish now my dream is out for all the worldI thought I stood upon the Forecastle and saw a parcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark that floated alongside and the devil perching on our spritfailyard in the likeness of a blue bearwho d'ye see jumped overboard upon the carcase and carried it to the bottom in his claws"  "Out upon thee reprobate cries the parson out upon thee blasphemous wretchDost thou think his honour's soul is in the possession of Satan"  The clamour immediately arose and my poor uncle who was shouldered from one corner of the room to the other was obliged to lug out in his own defence and swear he would turn out for no man till such time as he knew who had a title to send him adrift  "None of your tricks upon travellers said he may hap old buff has lest my kinsman here his heirIf he has it will be the better for his miserable soulOdd's bob I'd desire no better newsI'd soon make a clear ship I warrant you"  To avoid any farther disturbance one of my grandfather's executors who was present assured Mr Bowling that his nephew should have all manner of justice that a day should be appointed after the funeral for examining the papers of the deceased in presence of all his relations till such time every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close sealed and that he was very welcome to be witness of this ceremony  which was immediately performed to his satisfactionIn the mean time orders were given to provide mourning for all the relations in which number I was included but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of it until I should be assured whether or no I had reason to honour his memory so farDuring this interval the conjectures of people with regard to the old gentleman's will were various as it was well known he had besides his landed estate which was worth  l per annum  six or seven thousand pounds at interest Some imagined that the whole real estate which he had greatly improved would go to the young man whom he always entertained as his heir and that the money would be equally divided between my female cousins five in number and meOthers were of opinion that as the rest of his children had been already provided for he would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of his granddaughters and leave the bulk of the sum to me to atone for his unnatural usage towards my fatherAt length the important hour arrived and the will was produced in the midst of the expectants whose looks and gestures formed a groupe that would have been very entertaining to an unconcerned spectatorBut the reader can scarce conceive the astonishment and mortification that appeared when an attorney pronounced aloud the young 'squire sole heir of all his grandfather's estate personal and realMy uncle who had listened with great attention sucking the head of his cudgel all the while accompanied these words of the attorney with a stare and  whew  that alarmed the whole assembly The eldest and pertest of my female competitors who had been  always very officious about my grandfather's person enquired with a faultering accent and visage as yellow as an orange  "if there were no legacies"  she was answered  "none at all"  Upon which she fainted awayThe rest whose expectations perhaps were not so sanguine supported their disappointment with more resolution though not without giving evident marks of indignation and grief at least as genuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentleman's death My conductor after having kicked with his heel for some time against the wainscot began  "So there's no legacy friend hahere's an old Succubusbut somebody's soul howls for it dn me"  The parson of the parish who was one of the executors and had acted as ghostly director of the old man no sooner heard this than he cried out  "Avaunt unchristian reveler avaunt wilt thou not allow the soul of his honour to rest in the grave till the resurrection"  But this zealous pastor did not find himself so warmly seconded as formerly by the young ladies who now joined my uncle against him and accused him of having acted the part of a busybody with their grandpapa whose ears he had most certainly abused by false stories to their prejudice or else he would not have neglected them in such an unnatural mannerThe young 'squire was much diverted with this scene and whispered to my uncle that if he had not murdered his dogs he would have shewn him glorious sun by hunting a black badger so he term'd the clergymanThe surly lieutenant who was not in an humour to relish this amusement replied  "you and your dogs may be damnedI suppose you'll find them  with your old dad in the latitude of hellCome Roryabout ship my lad we must steer another course I think"  and away we went  CHAP V  The Schoolmaster uses me barbarouslyI form a project of revenge in which I am assisted by my uncleI leave the villageam settled at an university by his generosity  ON our way back to the village my uncle spoke not a word during the space of a whole hour but whistled with great vehemence the tune of  Why should we quarrel for riches c  his visage being contracted all the while into a most formidable srown At length his pace was increased to such a degree that I was often left behind a considerable way which when he perceived he would wait for me and when I was almost up with him call out in a surly tone  "Bear a hand dammemust I bring to every minute for you you lazy dog"  Then laying hold of me by the arm haul me along until his good nature of which he had a good share and reflection getting the better of his passion he would say  "Come my boy don't be cast downthe old rascal is in hellthat's some satisfactionyou shall go to sea with me my lad  A light heart and a thin pair of breeches goes thro' the world brave boys  as the song goeseh"  Though this proposal did  not at all suit my inclination I was afraid of discovering my aversion to it lest I should disoblige the only friend I had in the world and he was so much a seaman that he never dreamt I could have any objection to his design consequently gave himself no trouble in consulting my approbation But this resolution was soon dropt at the advice of our usher who assured Mr Bowling it would be a thousand pities to baulk my genius which would certainly one day make my fortune on shore provided it received due cultivationUpon which this generous tar determined though he could ill afford it to give me university education and accordingly settled my board and other expences at a town not many miles distant famous for its colleges whither we repaired in a short timeBut before the day of our departure the schoolmaster who no longer had the fear of my grandfather before his eyes laid aside all decency and restraint and not only abused me in the grossest language his rancour could suggest as a wicked profligate dull beggarly miscreant whom he had taught out of charity but also inveighed in the most bitter manner against the memory of the judge who by the bye had procured that settlement for him hinting in pretty plain terms that the old gentleman's soul was damn'd to all eternity for his injustice in neglecting to pay for my learningThis brutal behaviour added to the sufferings I had formerly undergone made me think it high time to be revenged of this insolent pedagogue Having consulted my adherents I found them all staunch in their promises to stand by me and our scheme was thisIn the afternoon preceeding the day of departure for the university I  was to take the advantage of the usher's going out to make water which he regularly did at four o'clock and shut the great door that he might not come to the assistance of his superior This being done the assault was to be begun by my advancing to the master and spitting in his face I was to be seconded by two of the strongest boys in the school who were devoted to me their business was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench over which he was to be laīd and his bare posteriors heartily flogged with his own birch which we proposed to wrest from him in the struggle but if we should find him too many for us all three we were to demand the assistance of our competitors who should be ready to reinforce us or oppose any thing that might be undertaken by the rest of the boys for the master's relief One of my principal assistants was called Jeremy Gawky son and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood and the name of the other Hugh Strap the cadet of a family which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mindI had once saved Gawky's life by plunging into a river where he was on the point of being drowned and by the help of swimming dragging him ashore I had often rescued him from the clutches of those whom his insufferable arrogance had provoked to a resentment he was not able to sustainand I had many times saved his reputation and posteriors by performing his exercises at school so that it is not to be wondered at if he had a particular regard for me and my interests The attachment of Strap flowed from a voluntary disinterested inclination which had manifested itself on many occasions in my behalf having once rendered me  the same service as I had afforded to Gawky by saving my life at the risk of his own and often fathered offences I had committed for which he suffered severely rather than I should feel the the weight of the punishment I deservedThese two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprize as they intended to leave the school next day as well as I the first being ordered by his father to return into the country and the other being bound apprentice to a barber at a market town not far off  In the mean time my uncle being informed of my master's behaviour to me was enraged beyond all composition and vowed revenge so heartily that I could not refrain from telling him the scheme I had concerted which he heard with great satisfaction at every sentence squirting out a mouthful of spittle tinctured with tobacco of which he constantly chewed a large quidAt last pulling up his breeches he cried  "No no Zds that won't do neitherhowsomever 'tis a bold undertaking my ladthat I must say i' faithbut lookée lookée how dost propose to get clear offwon't the enemy give chace my boyay ay that he will I warrantand alarm the whole coastah Gd help thee more sail than ballast RoryLet me alone for thatleave the whole to meI'll shew him the foretopsail I willIf so be that your shipmates are jolly boys and won't flinch you shall see you shall see egad I'll play him a saltwater trickI'll bring him to the gangway and anoint him with a cat and nine tailshe shall have a round dozen doubled my lad he shalland be left lashed to his meditations"  We  were very proud of our associate who immediately went to work and prepared the instrument of his revenge with great skill and expedition after which he ordered our baggage to be packed up and sent off a day before our attempt and got horses ready to be mounted as soon as the affair should be over At length the hour arrived when our auxiliary seizing the opportunity of the usher's absence bolted in secured the door and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar who bawled out  "Murder Thieves"  with the voice of a stentor Though I trembled all over like an aspenleas I knew there was no time to be lost and accordingly got up and summoned our associates to my assistanceStrap without any hesitation obeyed the signal and seeing me leap upon the master's back ran immediately to one of his legs which pulling with all his force this dreadful adversary was soon humbled to the ground upon which Gawky who had hitherto remained in his place under the influence of an universal trepidation hastened to the scene of action and insulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza in which the whole school joinedThis noise alarmed the usher who finding himself shut out endeavoured partly by threats and partly by entreaties to procure admissionMy uncle bid him have a little patience and he would let him in presently but if he pretended to move from that place it should fare the worse with the son of a bch his superior on whom he intended only to bestow a little wholesome chastifement for his barbarous usage of Rory  "to which said he you are no stranger"  By this time we had dragged the criminal to a post  to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on purpose after having fastened his hands behind his back pulled down his breeches and tucked up his garments and shirt as far as they would goIn this ludicrous posture he stood to the no small entertainment of the boys who crowded about him and shouted with great exultation at the novelty of the sight venting bitter imprecations against the lieutenant and reproaching his scholars with treachery and rebellion when the usher was admitted whom my uncle accosted in this manner  "Harkée Mr Syntax I believe you are an honest man d'ye seeand I have a respect for youbut for all that we must for our own security d'ye see belay you for a short time"  With these words he pulled out some fathoms of cord which the honest man no sooner saw than he protested with great earnestness that he would allow no violence to be offered to him at the same time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude But Bowling representing that it was in vain to resist and that he did not mean to use him with violence and indecency but only to hinder him from raising the hue and cry against us before we should be out of their power he allowed himself to be bound to his own desk where he sat a spectator of the punishment inflicted on his principal My uncle having unbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me told him that he proposed to give him a little discipline for the good of his soul which he immediately put in practice with great vigour and dexterity This smart application to the pedant's withered pofteriors gave him such exquisite pain that he roared like a mad bull danced cursed blasphemed and  acted to the life the part of a frantick bedlamite When the lieutenant thought himself sufficiently revenged he took his leave of him in these words  "Now friend you'll remember me the longest day you have to liveI have given you a lesson that will let you know what flogging is and teach you to have more sympathy for the futureshout boys shout"  This ceremony was no sooner over than my uncle proposed they should quit the school and convoy their old comrade Rory to a public house about a mile from the village where he would treat them allThis offer being joyfully embraced he addressed himself to Mr Syntax and begged him to accompany us which he refused with great disdain telling my benefactor that he was not the man he took him to be  "Well well old surly replied my uncle shaking his hand thou art an honest fellow notwithstanding and if ever I have the command of a ship thou shalt be school master i' faith"  So saying he dismissed the boys and locking the door left the two preceptors to console one another while we moved forwards on our journey attended by a numerous retinue whom he treated according to his promiseWe parted with many tears and lay that night at an inn on the road about ten miles short of the town where I was to remain at which we arrived next day and I found I had no cause to complain of the accommodations provided for me being boarded at the house of an apothecary who had married a distant relation of my mother In a few days after my uncle set out for his ship after having settled the necessary funds for my maintenance and education  CHAP VI  I make great progress in my studiesam caressed by every bodymy female cousins take notice of meI reject their invitationthey are incensed and conspire against meI am left destitute by a misfortune that befals my uncleGawky's treacherymy revenge  AS I was now capable of reflection I began to consider my precarious situation that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to protect me and that my sole dependance was on the generosity of one man who was not only exposed by his profession to continual dangers which might one day deprive me of him for ever but also no doubt subject to those vicissitudes of disposition which a change of fortune usually creates or which a better acquaintance with the world might producefor I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankindAlarmed at these considerations I resolved to apply myself with great care to my studies and enjoy the opportunity in my power This I did with such success that in the space of three years I understood Greek very well was pretty far advanced in the mathematics and no stranger to moral and natural philosophy logick I made no account of but above all things I valued myself on my taste in the  Belle Lettre  and a talent for poetry which had already produced some morceaus that brought me a great deal of reputation These qualifications added to a good face and shape acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most considerable people in town and I had the satisfaction to find myself in some degree of favour with the ladies an intoxicating piece of good fortune to one of my amorous complexion which I obtained or at least preserved by gratifying their propensity to scandal in lampooning their rivalsTwo of my female cousins lived in this place with their mother after the death of their father who left his whole fortune which was considerable equally divided between them so that if they were not the most beautiful they were at least the richest toasts in town and received daily the addresses of all the beaux and cavaliers of the countryAlthough I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the most supercilious contempt which I endeavoured to return by the most perfect neglect my character now attracted their notice so much that I was given to understand I might be honoured with their acquaintance if I pleasedThe reader will easily perceive that this condescension either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their malice or at least of screening themselves from the lash of my resentment which they effectually provokedI enjoyed this triumph with great rapture and not only rejected their offer with disdain but in all my performances whether satire or panegyric industriously avoided mentioning their names even while I celebrated those of their intimates which mortified their pride exceedingly and incensed them to such a degree  that they rendered themselves universally ridiculous in satisfying their resentment against meThe first stroke of their revenge consisted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against me the subject of which was my own poverty and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents but besides the badness of the composition of which they themselves were ashamed they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me with those misfortunes which they and their relations had intailed upon me and which consequently reflected much more dishonour on themselves than on me who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avariceFinding this plan miscarry they found means to irritate a young gentleman against me by telling him I had lampooned his mistress and so effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries that this enraged lover determined to seize me next night as I returned to my lodgings from a friend's house that I frequented with this view he waited in the street attended by two of his companions to whom he had imparted his design of carrying me down to the river in which he proposed to have me heartily ducked notwithstanding the severity of the weather it being then about the middle of DecemberBut this stratagem did not succeed for being apprised of their ambush I got home another way and by the help of my landlord's apprentice emptied a close stool out of the garret window which did great execution upon them and next day occasioned so much mirth at their expence that they found themselves under a necessity of leaving the town until the adventure should be entirely forgottenMy cousins though twice baffled in their expectation  did not however desist from persecuting me who had now enraged them beyond a possibility of forgiveness by detecting their malice and preventing its effects neither would I have found them more humane had I patiently submitted to their rancour and bore without murmuring the rigour of their unreasonable hate for I have found by experience that though small favours may be acknowledged and slight injuries atoned there is no wretch so ungrateful as he whom you have most generously obliged and no enemy so implacable as those who have done you most wrongThese goodnatured creatures therefore had recourse to a scheme which conspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received to give them all the satisfaction they desired this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident and prevail on him to betray the trust I reposed in him by imparting to them the particulars of my small amours which they published with such exaggerations that I suffered very much in the opinion of every body and was utterly discarded by the dear creatures whose names had been called in questionWhile I was busied in tracing out the author of this treachery that I might not only be revenged on him but also vindicate my character to my friends I one day perceived the looks of my landlady so altered when I went home to dinner that upon enquiring into the cause she screwed up her mouth and fixing her eyes on the ground told me her husband had received a letter from Mr Bowling with one inclosed for meshe was very sorry for what had happened both for my sake and his ownPeople should be more cautious of their cnoductshe  was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into some misfortune or otherAs for her part she would be very ready to befriend me but she had a small family of her own to maintainThe world would do nothing for her if she should come to wantcharity begins at homeShe wished I had been bound to some substantial handicraft such as a weaver or shoemaker rather than loiter away my time in learning foolish nonsense that would never bring me in a pennybut some folks are wise and some are otherwiseI was listening to this mysterious discourse with great amazement when her husband entered and without speaking a syllable put both the letters into my handI received them trembling and read what follows  To ROGER POTION  SIR  THIS is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of war being obliged to sheer off for killing my captain which I did fairly on the beach at Cape Tiberoon in the island of Hispaniola having received his fire and returned it which went through his bodyand I would serve the best man so that ever stept between stem and stern if so be that he struck me as captain Oakhum did I am thank God safe among the French who are very civil thof I don't understand their lingoand I hope to be restored in a little time for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the captain for I have sent home to my landlord in Deal an account  of the whole affair with our bearings and distances while we were engaged whereby I have desired him to lay it before his majesty who Gd bless him will not suffer an honest tar to be wrongedMy love to your spouse and am  Your loving friend and servant to command while Thomas Bowling  To RODERICK RANDOM  Dear RORY  DON'T be grieved at my misfortunebut mind your book my lad I have got no money to send you but what of thatMr Potion will take care of you for the love he bears to me and let you want for nothing and it shall go hard but I will see him one day repaidNo more at present but rests  Your dutiful uncle and servant till death Thomas Eowling  This letter which with the other was dated from Port Lou's in Hispaniola was no sooner read than the apothecary shaking his head began  "I have a very great regard for Mr  Bowling that's certainand could be well contentbut times are very hardThere's no such thingas money to be gotI believe 'tis all vanished underground for my partBesides I have been out of pocket already having entertained you since the beginning of this month without receiving a sixpenceand Gd knows if ever I shallfor I believe it will go hard with your uncleAnd more than that I was thinking of giving you warning for I want your apartment for a new 'prentice whom I expect from the country every hourSo I desire you will this week provide yourself with another lodging"  The indignation which this harangue inspired gave me spirits to support my reverse of fortune and to tell him I despised his mean selfish disposition so much that I would rather starve than be beholden to him for one single meal Upon which out of my pocketmoney I paid him to the last farthing of what I owed and assured him I would not sleep another night under his roofThis said I sallied out in a transport of rage and sorrow without knowing whither to fly for shelter having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me and only three shillings in my purseAfter giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage I went and hired a small bedroom at the rate of one shilling and sixpence  per  week which I was obliged to pay  per  advance before the landlord would receive me hither I removed my luggage and next morning got up with a view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on all occasions loaded me with caresses and made frequent offers of friendship while I was under  no necessity of accepting themHe received me with his wonted affability and insisted on my breakfasting with him which I did not think fit to refuseBut when I communicated the occasion of my visit he appeared so disconcerted that I concluded him wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition and looked upon him as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolenceHe did no leave me long under this mistake for recovering himself out of his confusion he told me he was grieved at my misfortune and desired to know what had passed between my landlord Mr Potion and me Whereupon I recounted the conversation and when I repeated the answer I made to his ungenerous remonstrance with regard to my leaving his house this pretended friend affected a stare and exclaimed  "Is it possible you could behave so ill to the man who had treated you so kindly all along"  My surprise at hearing this was not at all affected whatever his might be and I gave him to understand with some warmth that I did not imagine he would so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel who ought to be expelled from every social communityThis heat of mine gave him all the advantage he desired over me and our discourse after much altercation concluded in his desiring never to see me again in that place to which I yielded my consent assuring him that had I been as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now he never should have had an opportunity to make that requestAnd thus we parted  On my return I met my old comrade 'squire Gawky whom his father had sent some time ago to town for his improvement in writing  dancing fencing and to see the world As I had lived with him since his arrival on the footing of our old intimacy I made no scruple of informing him of the lowness of my circumstances and asking a small supply of money to answer my present expence upon which he pulled out an handful of halfpence with a shilling or two among them and swore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter day having lost the greatest part of his allowance the night before at billiards Though this might very well be true I was extremely mortified at his indifference for he neither discovered any sympathy for my mishap nor desire of alleviating my distress and accordingly I left him without uttering one word But when I afterwards understood that he was the person who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cousins to whom likewise he had carried the tidings of my forlorn situation which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation I determined with myself to call him to a severe account for which purpose I borrowed a sword and wrote a challenge desiring him to meet me at a certain time and place that I might have an opportunity of punishing his perfidy at the expence of his bloodHe accepted the invitation and I betook myself to the field though not without feeling considerable repugnance to the combat which frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the waybut the desire of revenge the shame of retracting and hope of conquest conspired to repel these unmanly symptoms of fear and I appeared on the plain with a good grace there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed and was not ill pleased to find he had no mind to  meet me because now I should have an opportunity of exposing his cowardice displaying my own courage and of beating him soundly wheresoever I should find him without any dread of the consequenceElevated with these suggestions which entirely banished all thoughts of my deplorable condition I went directly to Gawky's lodgings where I was informed of his precipitate retreat he having set out for the country in less than an hour after he had received my billetWhereupon I was vain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news although I was fain to sell a goldlaced hat to my landlord for less than halfprice to defray the expence and contribute to my subsistence  CHAP VII  I am entertained by Mr Craba description of himI acquire the art of surgeryconsult Crab's dispositionbecome necessary to himan accident happenshe advises me to launch out into the worldassists me with moneyI set out for London  THE fumes of my resentment being dissipated as well as the vanity of my success I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want and avoided by mankind as a creature of a different species or rather as a solitary being no ways comprehended within the scheme or protection of providence My despair  had rendered me almost quite stupified when I was one day told that a gentleman desired to see me at a certain publick house whither immediately I repaired and was introduced to one Mr Launcelot Crab a surgeon in town who was engaged with two more in drinking a liquor called  popin  composed by tossing a quartern of brandy into a quart of small beerBefore I relate the occasion of this message I believe it will not be disagreeable to the reader if I describe the gentleman who sent for me and mention some circumstances of his character and conduct which may illustrate what follows and account for his behaviour to me  This member of the faculty was aged fifty about five foot high and ten round the belly his face was capacious as a full moon and much of the complexion of a mulberry his nose resembling a powderhorn was swelled to an enormous size and studded all over with carbuncles and his little grey eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner that while he looked a person full in the face one would have imagined he was admiring the buckle of his shoeHe had long entertained an implacable resentment against Potion who tho' a younger practitioner had engrossed more business than he and once had the assurance to perform a cure whereby he disappointed and disgraced the prognostic of the said CrabThis quarrel which was at one time upon the point of being made up by the interposition and mediation of friends had been lately inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by the respective wives of the opponents who chancing to meet at a christening disagreed about precedence proceeded from invectives to blows  and were with great difficulty by the gossips prevented from converting the occasion of joy into a seene of blood  The difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour when I was sent for by Crab who received me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his disposition and after desiring me to sit enquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion which when I had related he said with a malicious grin  "Here's a sneaking dogI always thought him a fellow without a soul dn mea canting scoundrel who has crept into business by his hypocrisy and kissing the ase of every body"  "Ay ay says another one might see with half an eye that the rascal has no honesty in him by his going so regulary to church"  This sentence was confirmed by the third who assured his companions that Potion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once at a meeting of the godly where he had distinguished himself by an  extempore  prayer an hour longAfter this preamble Crab addressed himself to me in these words  "Well my lad I have heard a good character of you and I'll do for youYou may send your things to my house when you pleaseI have given orders for your receptionZds what does the booby stare atIf you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer you may let it alone and be dn'd"  I answered with a submissive bow that I was far from rejecting his friendly offer of which I would immediately avail myself as soon as he should  inform me on what footing I should be entertained  "What footing dn my blood cried he d'ye expect to have a footman and couple of horses kept for you"  No Sir I replied my expectations are not quite so sanguineThat I may be as little burthensome as possible I would willingly serve in your shop by which means I may save you the expence of a journeyman or porter at least for I understand a little pharmacy having employed some of my leisure hours in the practice of that art while I lived with Mr Potion neither am I altogether ignorant of surgery which I have studied with great pleasure and application  "O ho you did says Crab Gentlemen here is a compleat artistStudied surgery what in books I supposeI shall have you disputing with me one of these days on points of my professionYou can already account for muscular motion I warrant and explain the mystery of the brain and nerveshaYou are too learned for me dn meBut let's hear no more of this stuffcan you bleed and give a clyster spread a plaister and prepare a potion answer me to that"  Upon my answering him in the affirmative he shook his head telling me he believed he should have little good of me for all my promisesbut however he would take me in for the sake of charityI was accordingly that very night admitted to his house and had an apartment assigned to me in the garret which I was fain to put up with notwithstanding the mortification my pride suffered in this change of circumstances I was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me  in this manner for besides the gratification of his revenge in exposing the selfishness of his antagonist in opposition to his own generosity which was all affectation he had occasion for a young man who understood something of the profession to fill up the place of his eldest apprentice lately dead not without violent suspicion of foul play from his master's brutalityThe knowledge of this together with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease however as I did not perceive how I could bestow myself to better advantage I resolved to study Crab's temper with all the application and manage it with all the address I was master ofAnd it was not long before I found out a strange peculiarity of humour which governed his behaviour towards all his dependantsI observed when he was pleased he was such a niggard of his satisfaction that if his wife or servants betrayed the least symptom of participation he was offended to an insupportable degree of choler and fury the effects of which they seldom failed to feelAnd when his indignation was roused submission and soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and humanityI therefore pursued a contrary plan and one day when he honoured me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffinI boldly replied I was neither ignorant nor lazy since I both understood and performed my business as well as he could do for his soul neither was it just to call me ragamuffin for I had a whole coat on my back and was descended from a better family than any he could boast an alliance with He gave tokens of great amazement  at this assurance of mine and shook his cane over my head regarding me all the time with a countenance truly diabolical Although I was terribly startled at his menacing looks and posture I yet had reflection enough left to convince me I had gone too far to retract and that this was the critical minute which must decide my future lot in his service whereupon I snatched up the pestle of a mortar and swore if he offered to strike me without cause I would see whether his scull or my weapon was hardestHe continued silent for some time and at last broke forth into these ejaculations  "This is fine usage from a servant to a mastervery finedamnationbut no matter you shall pay for this you dog you shallI'll do your businessyes yes I'll teach you to lift your hand against me"  So saying he retired and left me under dreadful apprehensions which vanished intirely at our next meeting when he behaved with unusual complacency and treated me with a glass of punch after dinnerBy this conduct I got the ascendency over him in a short time and became so necessary to him in managing his business while he was engaged at the bottle that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect with regard to me and I consoled myself for the disregard of my former acquaintance with the knowledge I daily imbibed by a close application to the duties of my employment in which I succeeded beyond my own expectationI was on very good terms with my master's wife whose esteem I acquired and cultivated by representing Mrs Potion in the most ridiculous lights my satirical talents could invent as well as by rendering her some  christian offices when she had been too familiar with the dram bottle to which she had often times recourse for consolation under the affliction she suffered from a barbarous husbandIn this manner I lived without hearing the least tidings of my uncle for the space of two years during which time I kept little or no company being neither in a humour to relish nor in a capacity to maintain much acquaintance for the Nabal my master allowed me no wages and the small perquisites of my station scarce supplied me with the common necessaries of lifeI was no longer a pert unthinking coxcomb giddy with popular applause and elevated with the extravagance of hope my misfortunes had taught me how little the caresses of the world during a man's prosperity are to be valued by him and how seriously and expeditiously he ought to set himself about making himself independent of them My present appearance therefore was the least of my care which was wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of instruction that might secure me against the caprice of fortune for the future I became such a sloven and contracted such an air of austerity that every body pronounced me crestfallen and Gawky returned to town without running any risk from my resentment which was by this time pretty much cooled and restrained by prudential reasons so effectually that I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had done meWhen I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business I began to cast about for an opportunity of launching into the world in hopes of finding some provision that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone but as this could  not be effected without a small sum of money to equip me for the field I was in the utmost perplexity how to raise it well knowing that Crab for his own sake would never put me in a condition to leave him when his interest was so much concerned in my stayBut a small accident which happened about this time determined him in my favour This was no other than the pregnancy of his maid servant who declared her situation to me assuring me at the same time that I was the occasion of it Although I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her master and her of which availing myself I represented to her the folly of laying the burthen at my door when she might dispose of it to much greater advantage with Mr Crab She listened to my advice and next day acquainted him with the pretended success of their mutual endeavourHe was far from being overjoyed at this proof of his vigour which he foresaw might have very troublesome consequences not that he dreaded any domestic grumblings and reproaches from his wife whom he kept in perfect subjection but because he knew it would furnish his rival Potion with a handle for insulting and undermining his reputation there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness in the opinion of those who inhabit that part of the island where he livedHe therefore took a resolution worthy of himself which was to persuade the girl that she was not with child but only afflicted with a disorder incident to young women which he could easily remove with this view as he pretended he prescribed for her such medicines as he thought  would infallibly procure abortion but in this he was disappointed for the maid being advertised by me of his design and at the same time well satisfied with her own condition absolutely refused to follow his directions and threatned to publish her situation to the world if he did not immediately take some method of providing for the important occasion which she expected in a few monthsIt was not long before I guessed the result of his deliberation by his addressing himself to me one day in this manner  "I am surprised that a young fellow like you discovers no inclination to push his fortune in the worldBy Gd before I was of your age I was broiling on the coast of GuineaDamme what's to hinder you from profiting by the war which will certainly be declared in a short time against SpainYou may easily get on board of a king's ship in quality of a surgeon's mate where you will certainly see a great deal of practice and stand a good chance of getting prize money"  I laid hold of this declaration which I had long wished for and assured him I would follow his advice with pleasure if it was in my power but that it was impossible for me to embrace an opportunity of that kind having no friend to advance a little money to supply me with what necessaries I should want and defray the expences of my journey to LondonHe told me that few necessaries were required and as for the expence of my journey he would lend me money not only for that purpose but also to maintain me comfortably in London until I should procure a warrant for my provision aboard shipI gave him a thousand thanks for his obliging offer although I was very well apprized of his motive  which was to make his chambermaid lay the child to me after I was gone and accordingly set out in a few weeks for London my whole fortune consisting of one suit of cloaths half a dozen ruffled shirts as many plain two pair worsted stockings as many thread a case of pocket instruments a small edition of Horace Wiseman's surgery and ten guineas in cash for which Crab took my bond bearing  per cent  interest at the same time giving me a letter to the member of parliament for our town which he said would do my business  CHAP VIII  I arrive at Newcastlemeet with my old schoolfellow Strapwe determine to walk in company to Londonset out on our journeyput up at a solitary alehouseare disturbed by a strange adventure in the night  THERE is no such convenience as a waggon in this country and my finances were too weak to support the expence of hiring a horse I determined therefore to set out with the carriers who transport goods from one place to another on horseback this I accordingly put in execution on the first day of November sitting upon a packsaddle between two baskets one of which contained my goods in a knapsack But by the time we arrived at Newcastle upon Tyne I was so fatigued with the tediousness of the  carriage and benumbed with the coldness of the weather that I resolved to travel the rest of my journey on soot rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner  The hostler of the inn at which we put up understanding I was bound for London advised me to take my passage in a collier which would be both cheap and expeditious and withal much easier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads in the winter time which he believed I had not strength enough to performI was almost persuaded to take his advice when one day stepping into a barber's shop to be shaved the young man while he lathered my face accosted me thus  "Sir I presume you are a Scotchman"  To which I answered in the affirmative  "Pray continued he of what part of Scotland"  I no sooner told him than he discovered great emotion and not confining his operation to my chin and upper lip besmeared my whole face with great agitationAt which I was so offended that starting up I asked him what the dI he meant by using me soHe begged pardon telling me his joy in meeting with a countryman had occasioned some confusion in him and craved my nameBut when I declared my name was Random he exclaimed in a rapture  "How Rory Random"  The same I replied looking at him with astonishment  "What cried he don't you know your old schoolfellow Hugh Strap"  At that instant recollecting his face I flew into his arms and in the transport of my joy gave him back one half of the suds he had so lavishly bestowed on my countenance so that we made a very ludicrous appearance and furnished  a great deal of mirth to his master and shopmates who were witnesses of this sceneWhen our mutual caresses were over I sat down again to be shaved but the poor fellow's nerves were so discomposed by this unexpected meeting that his hand could scarcely hold the razor with which nevertheless he found means to cut me in three places in as many strokes His master perceiving his disorder bid another supply his place and after the operation was performed gave Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with meWe retired immediately to my lodgings where calling for some beer I desired to be informed of his adventures which contained nothing more than that his master dying before his time was out he had come to Newcastle about a year ago in expectation of journeywork along with three young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels that he had the good fortune of being employed by a very civil master with whom he intended to stay till the spring at which time he proposed to go to London where he did not doubt of finding encouragementWhen I communicated to him my situation and design he did not approve of my taking a passage by sea by reason of the danger of a winter voyage which is very hazardous along that coast as well as the precariousness of the wind which might possibly detain me a great while to the no small detriment of my fortune whereas if I would venture by land he would bear me company carry my baggage as well as his own all the way and if we should find ourselves fatigued it would be no hard matter for us to find on the road either returnhorses or waggons of which we might take the opportunity for a  very trifling expenceI was so ravished at this proposal that I embraced him affectionately and assured him he might command my purse to the last farthing but he gave me to understand he had saved money sufficient to answer his own occasions and that he had a friend in London who would soon introduce him into business in that capital and might possibly have it in his power to serve me like wise  Having concerted our plan and settled our affairs that night we departed next morning by daybreak armed with a good cudgel each my companion being charged with the furniture of us both crammed into one knapsack which he carried after the manner of soldiers on a march and our money sewed between the lining and wastband of our breeches except some loose silver for our immediate expence on the roadWe travelled all day at a round pace but being ignorant of the proper stages we were benighted at a good distance from any inn which compelled us to take up our lodging at a small hedge alehouse that stood by itself on a byroad about half a mile from the highway There we found a pedlar of our own country in whose company we regaled ourselves with bacon and eggs and a glass of good ale before a comfortable fire conversing all the while very sociably with the landlord and his daughter an hale buxome lass who entertained us with great good humour and in whose affection I was vain enough to believe I had made some progressAbout eight a clock we were all three at our own desire shewn into an apartment where were two beds in one of which Strap and I betook ourselves to rest and the pediar occupied the other though not before he had prayed a considerable  time  extempore  searched into every corner of the room and fastened the door on the inside with a strong iron screw which he carried about with him for that useI slept very sound till midnight when I was disturbed by a violent motion of the bed which shook under me with a continual tremorAlarmed at this phoenomenon I jogged my companion whom to my no small amazement I found drenched in sweat and quaking through every limb he told me with a low faultering voice that we were undone for there was a bloody highwayman loaded with pistols in the next room then bidding me make as little noise as possible he directed me to a small chink in the board partition through which I could see a thick set brawny sellow with a fierce countenance sitting at a table in company with our young landlady having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols before themI listened with great attention and heard him say in a terrible tone  "Dn that son of a bh Smack the coachmanhe has served me a fine trick indeedbut dtion seize me if I don't make him repent itI'll teach the scoundrel to give intelligence to others while he is under articles with me"  Our landlady endeavoured to appease this exasperated robber by saying that he might possibly be mistaken in Smack who perhaps kept no correspondence with the other gentleman that robbed his coachand that if an accident had disappointed him to day he might soon find opportunities enough to atone for his lost trouble  "I'll tell thee what my dear Bett replied he I never had nor never will while my name is Rifle have such a glorious booty as I missed  todayZds there was  l  in cash to recruit men for the king's service besides the jewels watches swords and money belonging to the passengershad it been my fortune to have got clear off with so much treasure I would have purchased a commission in the army and made you an officer's lady you jade I would"  "Well well cries Betty we must trust to providence for thatbut did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the other adventurer"  "Not much saith said the lover I gleaned a few thingssuch as a pair of pops silvermounted here they are I took them loaded out of the pockets of the captain who had the charge of the money together with a gold watch which he had concealed in his breechesI likewise found ten Portugal pieces in the shoes of a quaker whom the spirit moved to revile me with great bitterness and devotion but what I value myself mostly for is this here purchase a gold snuffbox my girl with a young gentleman's picture on the inside of the lid which I untied out of the tail of a pretty lady's smock"  Here as the devil would have it the pedlar snored so loud that the highwayman snatching his pistols started up crying  "Hell and dnn I am betrayedwho's that in the next room"  Mrs Betty told him he need not be uneasy there were only three poor wearied travellers who mistaking the road had taken up their lodging there and were asleep long ago  "Travellers says he spies you bch but no matterby Gd I'll send them all to hell in an instant"  He accordingly run towards our door when his sweetheart  interposing assured him there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen who were too raw and ignorant to give him the least cause of suspicion and the third was a Presbyterian pedlar of the same nation who had often lodged in the house beforeThis declaration satisfied the thief who swore he was glad there was a pedlar there for he wanted some linenThen in a jovial manner he put about the glass mingling his discourse to Betty with caresses and familiarities that spoke him very happy in his amours During that part of the conversation which regarded us Strap had crept under the bed where he lay without sense or motion so that it was with great difficulty I persuaded him our danger was over and prevailed on him to wake the pedlar and inform him of what we had seen and heardThis itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking him by the shoulder than he started up calling as loud as he could  "Thieves thievesLd have mercy on us"  Rifle alarmed at this exclamation jumped up cocked one of his pistols and turned towards the door to kill the first man who should enter for he verily believed himself beset when his Dulcinea after an immoderate fit of laughter persuaded him that the poor pedlar dreaming of thieves had only cried out in his sleepMeanwhile my comrade had undeceived our fellowlodger and informed him of his reason for disturbing him upon which getting up softly he peeped through the hole and was so terrified with what he saw that falling down on his bare knees he put up a long petition to heaven to deliver him from the hands of that ruffian and promised never to defraud a customer for the future  of the value of a halfpenny provided he might be rescued from his present distressWhether or not this disburthening his conscience afforded him any ease I know not but he slipt into bed again and lay very quiet until the robber and his mistress were asleep which he understood by their snoring in concert then rising softly he untied a rope that was round his pack and making it fast to one end of it opened the window with as little noise as possible and lowered his goods into the yard with great dexterity which having done he moved gently to our bedside and bid us farewel telling us that as we run no risk we might take our rest with great confidence and in the morning assure the landlord that we knew nothing of his escape then shaking us by the hands and wishing us all manner of success he let himself drop from the window without any danger to the ground which was not above one yard from his feet as he hung on the outside Although I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight I was not at all free from apprehension when I reflected on what might be the effects of the highwayman's disappointment who certainly intended to make free with the pedlar's ware Neither was my companion at more ease in his mind but on the contrary so possessed with the dreadful idea of Rifle that he solicited me strongly to follow our countryman's example and so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer who would certainly wreak his vengeance on us as accomplices of the pedlar's elopementBut I represented to him the danger of giving Rifle cause to think we knew his profession by putting him in mind that if ever he should meet us again on the road which  far from being impossible he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance and find it his interest to put us out of the wayI told him withal the confidence I had in Betty's goodnature in which he acquiesced and during the remaining part of the night we concerted a proper method of behaviour to render us unsuspected in the morning  It was no sooner day than Betty entering our chamber and perceiving the window open cried out  "Ods bobs Sure you Scotchmen must have hot constitutions to lie all night with the window open in such cold weather"  I feigned to start out of sleep and withdrawing the curtain called  "What's the matter"  When she shewed me I affected surprize and said  "Bless me the window was shut when we went to bed"  "I'll be hanged said she if Sawny Waddle the pedlar has not got up in a dream and done it for I heard him very obstropulous in his sleepSure I put a chamberpot under his bed"  With these words she advanced to the bed in which he lay and finding the sheets cold she exclaimed  "Good lack a daisy the rogue is fled"  "Fled cried I with a feigned amazement Gd forbidSure he has not robbed us"  Then springing up I laid hold of my breeches and emptied all my loose money into my hand which having reckoned I said Heaven be praised our money is all safeStrap look to the knapsackHe did so and found all was rightUpon which we asked with seeming concern if he had stole nothing belonging to the house  "No no replied she he has stole nothing but his reckoning"  which it seems this pious pedlar  had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotionBetty after a moment's pause withdrew and immediately we could hear her waken Rifle who no sooner heard of Waddle's flight than he jumped out of bed and dressed venting a thousand execrations and vowing to murder the pedlar if ever he could set eyes on him again  "For said he the scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against me"  Having dressed himself in a hurry he mounted his horse and for that time rid us of his company and a thousand fears that were the consequence of itWhile we were at breakfast Betty endeavoured by all the cunning she was mistress of to learn whether or no we suspected our fellowlodger whom we saw take horse but as we were on our guard we answered her sly questions with a simplicity she could not distrust when all of a sudden we heard the trampling of a horse's feet at the door This noise alarmed Strap so much whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the image of Rifle that with a countenance as pale as milk he cried out  "O Lord there's the highwayman returned"  Our landlady startled at these words said  "What highwayman young manDo you think any highwaymen harbour here"  Though I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in Strap I had presence of mind enough to tell her we had met a horseman the day before whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman because he rode with pistols and that he was terrified at the sound of a horse's feet ever sinceShe forced a smile at the ignorance and timorousness of my comrade but I could perceive not  without great concern that this account was not at all satisfactory to her  CHAP IX  We proceed on our journeyare overtaken by an highwayman who fires at Strap is prevented from shooting me by a company of horsemen who ride in pursuit of himStrap is put to bed at an innAdventures at that inn  AFTER having paid our score and taken leave of our hostess who embraced me tenderly at parting we proceeded on our journey blessing our selves that we had come off so well We had not walked above five miles when we observed a man on horseback galloping after us whom we in a short time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us so much vexationHe stopped hard by me and asked if I knew who he wasMy astonishment had disconcerted me so much that I did not hear his question which he repeated with a volley of oaths and threats but I remained as mute as beforeStrap seeing my discomposure fell upon his knees in the mud uttering with a lamentable voice these words  "For Chst's sake have mercy upon us Mr Rifle we know you very well"  "O ho cried the thief you dobut by Gd you never shall be evidence against me in this world you dog"  So saying he drew a  pistol and fired it at the unfortunate shaver who fell flat upon the ground without speaking one wordMy comrade's fate and my own situation rivetted me to the place where I stood deprived of all sense and reflection so that I did not make the least attempt either to run away or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian who snapped a second pistol at me but before he had time to prime again perceived a company of horsemen coming up whereupon he rode off and left me standing motionless as a statue in which posture I was sound by those whose appearance had saved my lifeThis company which consisted of three men in livery well armed was headed by an officer who as I afterwards learned was the person from whom Rifle had taken the pocket pistols the day before and who making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road assuring him his nonresistance was altogether owing to his consideration for the ladies in the coach procured the assistance of his Lordship's servants to go in quest of the plundererThis holiday captain scampered up to me with great address and asked who fired the pistol which he had heardAs I had not yet recovered my reason he before I could answer observed a body lying on the ground at which sight his colour vanished and he pronounced with a faultering tongue  "Gentlemen here's murder committed I Let us alight"  "No no said one of his followers let us rather pursue the murdererWhich way went he young man"  By this time I had recollected myself so far as to tell them he could not be a quarter of a mile before them and beg one of them to assist me in conveying the corps of my friend to the next  house in order to its being interredThe captain foreseeing that in case he pursued he must soon come to action began to curb his horse and give him the spur at the same time which made the creature rear up and snort in such a manner that he called out his horse was frightened and would not proceed at the same time wheeling him round and round stroaking his neck whistling and wheedling him with  "Sirrah sirrahgently gently c"  "Zds cries one of the servants sure my Lord's Sorrel is not resty"  With these words he bestowed a lash on his buttocks and Sorrel disdaining the rein sprung forward with the captain at a pace that would have soon brought him up with the robber had not the girth happily for him given way by which means he landed in the dirt and two of his attendants continued their pursuit without minding his situation in the leastMean while one of the three who remained at my desire turning the Body of Strap to one side in order to see the wound which had killed him found him still warm and breathing whereupon I immediately let him blood and saw him with inexpressible joy recover having received no other wound than what his sear inflictedHaving got him upon his legs we walked together to an inn about half a mile from the place where Strap being not quite recovered went to bed and in a little time after the third servant returned with the captain's horse and furniture leaving himself to crawl after as well as he could This Gentleman of the sword upon his arrival complained grievously of the bruise occasioned by his fall and on the recommendation of the servant  who warranted my ability I was employed to bleed him for which he rewarded me with half a crown  The time between this and dinner I passed in observing a game at cards between two farmers an exciseman and a young fellow in a rusty gown and cassock who as I afterwards understood was curate of a neighbouring parishIt was easy to perceive that the match was not equal the two farmers being partners having to do with a couple of sharpers who stript them of all their cash in a very short timeBut what surprised me very much was to hear this clergyman reply to one of the countrymen who seemed to suspect foul play in these words  "Dn me friend d'ye question my honour"  I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals this being an animal frequent in my own country but I was scandalized at the indecency of his behaviour which appeared in the oaths he swore and the baudy songs which he sungAt last to make amends in some sort for the damage he had done the unwary boo  s he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown and promising to treat them with a dinner began to play most melodiously singing all the while in concertThis good humour of the parson inspired the company with so much glee that the farmers soon forgot their losses and all hands went to dancing in the yard While we were agreeably amused in this manner our musician spying a horseman riding towards the inn stopt all of a sudden crying out  "Gad so gentlemen I beg your pardon there's our dog of a doctor coming into the inn"  And immediately concealed his instrument and ran towards the gate where he took hold of the  vicar's bridle and helped him off enquiring very cordially into the state of his healthThis rosy son of the church who might be about the age of fifty having alighted and entrusted the curate with his horse stalked with great solemnity into the kitchen where sitting down by the fire he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe scarce deigning an answer to the submissive questions of some present who knew him about the welfare of his familyWhile he indulged himself in this state amidst a profound silence the curate approaching him with great reverence asked if he would not be pleased to honour us with his company at dinner To which he answered in the negative saying he had been to visit 'squire Bumpkin who had drank himself into a high fever at the last assizes and that he had on leaving his own house told Betty he should dine at homeAccordingly when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe he got up and moved towards the door with the fame dignity as when he entered where his journeyman stood ready with his nagHe had no sooner mounted than this facetious person coming into the kitchen began in this manner  "There the old rascal goes and the Dl go with himYou see how the world wags gentlemenBy Gd this rogue of a vicar does not deserve to liveand yet he has two livings worth  l per annum  while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach for what why truly for  l  a yearI scorn to boast of my own qualifications butcomparisons you know are odiousI should be glad to know how this swagbellied doctor deserves to be more at ease than meHe can loll in his  elbow chair at home indulge himself in the best of victuals and wine and enjoy the conversation of Betty his housekeeperYou understand me gentlemenBetty is the doctor's poor kinswoman and a pretty girl she isbut no matter for thatay and a dutiful girl to her parents whom she goes to see regularly every year though I must own I could never learn in what county they liveMy service t'ye gentlemen"  By this time dinner being ready I waked my companion and we eat all together with great chearfulness and satisfaction When our meal was ended and every man's share of the reckoning adjusted the curate went out on pretence of some necessary occasion and mounting his horse left the two farmers to satisfy the host in the best manner they couldWe were no sooner informed of this piece of finesse then the exciseman who had been silent hitherto began with a malicious grin  "Ay ay this is an old trick of ShufleI could not help smiling when he talked of treatingYou must know this is a very curious fellowHe picked up some scraps of learning while he served young lord Trifle at the universityBut what he most excells in is pimpingNo man knows his talents better than I for I was  valet de chambre  to 'squire Tattle an intimate companion of Shuffle's lordHe got himself into a scrape by pawning some of his lordship's cloaths on which account he was turned away but as he was acquainted with some particular circumstances of my lord's conduct he did not care to exasperate him too much and so made interest for his receiving orders and afterwards recommended him to the curacy  which he now enjoysHowever the fellow cannot be too much admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood in spite of such a small allowanceYou hear he plays a good stick and is really diverting companythis makes him agreeable wherever he goesand as for playing at cards there is not a man within three counties a match for himthe truth is he is a damnable cheat and can shift a card with such address that it is impossible to discover him"  At this he was interrupted by one of the farmers who asked him why he had not justice enough to acquaint them with these particulars before they engaged in playThe exciseman replied without any hesitation that it was none of his business to intermeddle between man and man besides he did not know they were ignorant of Shuffle's character which was notorious to the whole countryThis did not satisfy the other who taxed him with abetting and assisting the curate's knavery and insisted on having his share of the winning returned which the exciseman as positively refused affirming that whatever slights Shuffle might practise on other occasions he was very certain that he had play'd on the square with them and would answer it before any bench in christendom so saying he got up and having paid his reckoning sneaked off The landlord thrusting his neck into the passage to see if he was gone shook his head saying  "Ah Lord help us if every sinner was to have his desertsWell we victuallers must not disoblige the excisemenBut I know whatif parson Shuffle and he were weighed together a straw thrown into either scale would make  the ballance kick the beamBut masters this is under the rose continued Boniface with a whisper"  CHAP X  The highwayman is takenwe are detained as evidences against himproceed to the next villagehe escapeswe arrive at another inn where we go to bedin the night we are awaked by a dreadful adventurenext night we lodge at the house of a schoolmasterour treatment there  STRAP and I were about to depart on our journey when we perceived a croud on the road coming towards us shouting and hollowing all the way As it approached we could discern a man on horseback in the middle with his hands tied behind him whom we soon knew to be RifleThis highwayman not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit of him was soon overtaken and after having discharged his pistols made prisoner without any further opposition They were carrying him in triumph amidst the acclamations of the country people to a justice of peace in a neighbouring village but stopt at our inn to join their companion and take refreshment When Rifle was dismounted and placed in the yard within a circle of peasants armed with pitchforks I was amazed to see what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared who had but a few hours ago  filled me with so much terror and confusionMy companion was so much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance that going up to the thief he presented his clenched fists to his nose and declared that he would either cudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea which he immediately produced and began to stripbut was dissuaded from this adventure by me who represented to him the folly of the undertaking as Rifle was now in the hands of justice which would no doubt give us all satisfaction enoughBut what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity was our being detained by the captors as evidence against him when we were just going to set forward However there was no remedy we were obliged to comply and accordingly joined in the cavalcade which luckily took the same road that we proposedAbout the twilight we arrived at the place of our destination but as the justice was gone to visit a gentleman in the country with whom he would probably stay all night the robber was confined in an empty garret three stories high from which it seemed impossible for him to escape this nevertheless was the case for next morning when they went up stairs to bring him before the justice the bird was flown having got out at the window upon the leads from whence he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoining houses and got into another garret window where he sculked until the family were asleep at which time he ventured down stairs and let himself out by the street door which was found open This event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him who were flushed with hopes of the reward but gave me great joy as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any further molestationResolving to make up for the small  progress we had hitherto made we this day travelled with great vigour and before night got to a markettown twenty miles from the place from whence we set out in the morning without meeting any adventure worth noticeHere having taken up our lodging at an inn I found myself so fatigued that I began to despair of performing our journey on foot and desired Strap to enquire if there was any waggon returnhorses or other cheap carriage in this place to depart for London tomorrow or next dayHe was informed that the waggon from Newcastle for London had halted here two nights ago and that it would be an easy matter to overtake it if not the next day at farthest the day after the nextThis piece of news gave us some satisfaction and after making a hearty supper on hashed mutton we were shewn to our room which contained two beds the one allotted for us and the other for a very honest gentleman who we were told was then drinking below Though we could have very well dispensed with his company we were glad to submit to this disposition as there was not another bed empty in the house and accordingly went to rest after having secured our baggage under the bolster About two or three aclock in the morning I was waked out of a very profound sleep by a dreadful noise in the chamber which did not fail to throw me into an agony of consternation when I heard these words pronounced with a terrible voice  "Blood and wounds run the halbert into the guts of him that's next you and I'll blow the other's brains out presently"  This dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap than starting out of bed he run against some body in the dark  and overturned him in an instant at the same time bawling out  "Fire murder fire  which in a moment alarmed the whole house and filled our chamber with a croud of naked peopleWhen lights were brought the occasion of all this disturbance soon appeared which was no other than our fellow lodger whom we found lying on the floor scratching his head with a look testifying the utmost astonishment at the concourse of apparitions that surrounded himThis honest gentleman was it seems a recruiting serjeant who having listed two country fellows overnight dreamed they had mutinied and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along himThis made such an impression on his imagination that he got up in his sleep and expressed himself as aboveWhen our apprehension of danger vanished the company beheld one another with great surprize and mirth but what attracted the notice of every one was our landlady with nothing on her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches with the backside before which she had slipt on in the hurry and her husband with her petticoat about his shoulders one had wrapt himself in a blanket another was covered with a sheet and the drummer who had given his only shirt to be washed appeared in  querpo  with the bolster rolled about his middleWhen this affair was discussed every body retired to his own apartment the serjeant slipt into bed and my companion and I slept without any further disturbance till the morning when we got up went to breakfast paid our reckoning and set forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon in which however we were disappointed that day As we  exerted ourselves more than usual I found myself quite spent with fatigue when we entered a small village in the twilight We enquired for a publick house and were directed to one of a very sorry appearance At our entrance the landlord who seemed to be a venerable old man with long grey hair rose from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchin and with a chearful countenance accosted us in these words  "  Salvete Pueriingredimini  "  I was not a little pleased to hear our host speak Latin because I was in hopes of recommending myself to him by my knowledge in that language I therefore answered without hesitation  Dissolve frigus ligna super focolarge reponens  I had no sooner pronounced these words than the old gentleman runing towards me shook me by the hand crying  "  Fili mi dilectissime unde venisa superis ni fallor  "  in short finding we were both read in the classicks he did not know how to testify his regard but ordered his daughter a jolly rosycheeked damsel who was his sole domestic to bring us a bottle of his  quadrimum  repeating from Horace at the same time  "  Deprome quadrimum sabinâ O thaliarche merum diotâ  "  This  quadrimum  was excellent ale of his own brewing of which he told us he had always an  amphora  four years old for the use of himself and friendsIn the course of our conversation which was interlarded with scraps of Latin we understood that this facetious person was a schoolmaster whose income being small he was fain to keep a glass of good liquor for the entertainment of passengers by which he made shift to make the two ends of the year meet  "I am this day said he the happiest old fellow in his majesty's  dominionsMy wife rest her soul is in heaven My daughter is to be married next weekbut the two chief pleasures of my life are these pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace that lay one the table I am old 'tis truewhat then the more reason I should enjoy the small share of life that remains as my friend Flaccus advises  Tu ne quaesieris scire nefas Quem mihi quem tibi finem dii dederintCarpe diem quam minimum credula postero  "  As he was very inquisitive about our affairs we made no scruple of acquainting him with our situation which when he had learned he enriched us with advices how to behave in the world telling us that he was no stranger to the deceits of mankindIn the mean time he ordered his daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for supper for he was resolved this night to regale his friends  permittens divis caetera  While our entertainment was preparing our host recounted the adventures of his own life which as they contain nothing remarkable I forbear to rehearse When we had fared sumptuously and drank several bottles of his  quadrimum  I expressed a desire of going to rest which was with some difficulty complied with after he had informed us that we should overtake the waggon by noon next day and that there was room enough in it for half a dozen there being only four passengers as yet in that convenienceBefore my comrade and I fell asleep we had some conversation about the good humour of our landlord which gave Strap such an idea of his benevolence that he was positive we should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment  "Don't you observe said he  that he has conceived a particular affection for usnay even treated us at supper with extraordinary fare which to be sure we should not of ourselves have called for"  I was partly of Strap's opinion but the experience I had of the world made me suspend my belief till tomorrow morning when getting up betimes we breakfasted with our host and his daughter on hastypudding and ale and desired to know what we had to pay  "Biddy will let you know gentlemen said he for I never mind these mattersMoneymatters are beneath the concern of one who lives on the Horatian plan  Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam  "  Mean while Biddy having consulted a slate that hung in a corner told us our reckoning came to  s    d    "Eight shillings and seven pence cried Strap 'tis impossibleyou must be mistaken young woman"  "Reckon again child says her father very deliberately perhaps you have miscounted"  "No indeed father she replied I know my business better"  I could contain my indignation no longer but said it was a very unconscionable bill and demanded to know the particulars upon which the old man got up muttering  "Ay ay let us see the particularsthat's but reasonable"  And taking pen ink and paper wrote the following  Items     s  d  To bread and beer      To a fowl and sausages      To four bottles  quadrim      To fire and tobacco      To lodging      To breakfast             As he had not the appearance of a common publican and had raised a sort of veneration in me by his demeanor the preceding night it was not in my power to unbraid him as he deserved therefore I contented myself with saying I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Horace He answered  "I was a but young man and did not know the world or I would not tax him with extortion whose only aim was to live  contentus parvo  and keep off  importuna pauperies  "  My fellowtraveller could not so easily put up with this imposition but swore he should either take one third of the money or go withoutWhile we were engaged in this dispute I perceived the daughter go out and conjecturing the occasion immediately paid the exorbitant demand which was no sooner done than Biddy returned with two stout fellows who came in on pretence of taking their morning draught but in reality to frighten us into complianceJust as we departed Strap who was half distracted on account of this piece of expence went up to the schoolmaster and grinning in his face pronounced with great emphasis  "Semper avarus eget"  To which the pedant replied with a malicious smile  "  Animum rege qui nisi paret imperat  "  CHAP XI  We descry the waggonget into itarrive at an innour fellow travellers describeda mistake is committed by Strap which produces strange things  WE travelled half a mile without exchanging one word my thoughts being engrossed by the knavery of the world to which I must be daily exposed and the contemplation of my finances which began sensibly to diminishAt length Strap who could hold no longer addressed me thus  "Well fools and their money are soon partedIf my advice had been taken that old skinflint should have been damn'd before he had got more than the third of his demand'Tis a sure sign you came easily by your money when you squander it away in this mannerAh God help you how many brisly beards must I have mowed before I earned shillings and three pence halfpenny which is all thrown to the dogsHow many days have I sat weaving hair till my toes were numbed by the cold my fingers cramp'd and my nose as blue as the sign of the periwig that hung over the doorWhat the devil was you afraid of I would have engaged to box with any one of those fellows who came in for a guineaI'm sure I have beat stouter men than either of them"  And indeed my companion would have fought  any body when his life was in no danger but he had a mortal aversion to fire arms and all instruments of death In order to appease him I assured him no part of this extraordinary expence should fall upon his shoulders at which he was affronted and told me he would have me to know that although he was a poor barber's boy he had a soul to spend his money with the best 'squire of the landHaving walked all day at a great pace without halting for a refreshment we descried towards the evening to our inexpressible joy the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us and by that time we came up with it were both of us so weary that I verily believe it would have been impracticable for us to have walked one mile furtherWe therefore bargained with the driver whose name was Joey to give us a cast to the next stage for a shilling at which place we would meet the master of the waggon with whom we might agree for the rest of the journey  Accordingly the convenience stopt and Joey having placed the ladder Strap being loaded with our baggage mounted first but just as he was getting in a tremendous voice assailed his ears in these words  "God's fury there shall no passengers come here"  The poor shaver was so disconcerted at this exclamation which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant that he descended with great velocity and a countenance as white as paperJoey perceiving our astonishment called with an arch sneer  "Waunds captain whay woan't yau sooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a pennyCoom coom young man get oop get oopnever moind the coptainI'se not  afear'd of the coptain"  This was not encouragement sufficient to Strap who could not be prevailed upon to venture up again upon which I attempted though not without a quaking heart when I heard the same voice muttering like distant thunder  "By Gd I won't be used so dnn seize me if I am"  However I crept in and by accident got an empty place in the straw which I immediately took possession of without being able to discern the faces of my fellowtravellers in the dark Strap following with the knapsack on his back chanced to take the other side and by a jolt of the carriage pitched directly upon the stomach of the captain who bellowed out in a most dreadful manner  "Blood and thunder where's my sword"  At these words my frighted comrade started up and at one spring bounced against me with such force that I thought the supposed son of Anak intended to smother meIn the mean time a female voice cried out  "Bless me what is the matter my dear"  "The matter replied the captain damn my blood my guts are almost squeezed out by that Scotchman's hump"  Strap trembling all the while at my back asked him pardon and laid the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggonThe woman who spoke before went on  "Ay ay my dear it is our own faultwe may thank ourselves for all the inconveniencies we meet withI thank God I never travelled so beforeI'm sure if my lady or Sir John was to know where we are they would not sleep this night for vexationI wish to God we had writ for the chariotI know we shall never be forgiven"  "Come come my dear replied the captain  it don't signify fretting nowwe shall laugh it over as a frolickI hope you will not suffer in your healthI shall make my lord very merry with our adventures in the  Diligence  "  This discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady that I durst not venture to join in the conversation but immediately after another female voice begins  "Some people give themselves a great many needless airsbetter folks than any here have travelled in waggons before nowSome of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind them without making so much fuss about itWhat then we are now all upon a footing therefore let us be sociable and merryWhat do you say Isaac Is'n't this a good motion you doting rogueSpeak you old  cent per cent  fornicatorWhat desperate debt are you thinking of What mortgage are you planning Well Isaac positively you shall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf grow honest and live like a gentlemanIn the mean time give me a kiss you old fumbler"  These words accompanied with a hearty smack enlivened the person to whom they were addressed to such a degree that he cried in transport tho' with a quavering voice  "Ah you wanton baggageupon my credit you are a waggish girl he he he"  This laugh introduced a fit of coughing which almost suffocated the poor usurer such we afterwards found was the profession of this our fellowtravellerAbout this time I fell asleep and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such time as we arrived at the inn where we put upHere having got out of the waggon  first I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order as they enteredThe first who appeared was a brisk airy girl about twenty years old with a silverlaced hat on her head instead of a cap a blue stuff riding suit trimmed with silver very much tarnished and a whip in her handAfter her came limping an old man with a worsted nightcap buttoned under his chin and a broad brimmed hat slouched over it an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck under which appeared a brown surtout that covered a threadbare coat and wastecoat and as we afterwards discerned a dirty flannel jacketHis eyes were hollow bleared and gummy his face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles his gums were destitute of teeth his nose sharp and drooping his chin peeked and prominent so that when he mumped or spoke they approached one another like a pair of nutcrackers he supported himself on an ivoryheaded cane and his whole figure was a just emblem of winter famine and avariceBut how was I surprized when I beheld the formidable captain leading in his wife in the shape of a little thin creature about the age of forty with a long withered visage very much resembling that of a baboon through the upper part of which two little grey eyes peeped He wore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump which immoderate length I suppose was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on the crown of his head when he deigned to take off his hat which was very much of the size and cock of Pistol'sHaving laid aside his great coat I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war He was about five foot and three inches high sixteen inches of  which went to his face and long scraggy neck his thighs were about six inches in length his legs resembling spindles or drumsticks two feet and an half and his body which put me in mind of extension without substance engrossed the remainderso that on the whole he appeared like a spider or grashopper erectand was almost a  vox preterca nihil  His dress consisted in a frock of what is called bearskin the skirts of which were about half a foot long an Hussar waistcoat scarlet breeches reaching half way down his thigh worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin and shoes with wooden heels at least two inches high he carried a sword very near as long as himself in one hand and in the other conducted his lady who seemed to be a woman of his own age and still retained some remains of an agreeable person but so ridiculously affected that had I then known as much of the world as I do now I might have easily perceived in her the deplorable vanity and secondhand airs of a lady's womanWe were all assembled in the kitchen when captain Weazel for that was his name desired a room with a fire for himself and spouse and told the landlord they would sup by themselvesThe innkeeper replied that he could not afford them a room by themselves and as for supping he had prepared victuals for the passengers in the waggon without respect of persons but if he could prevail on the rest to let him have his choice in a separate manner with all his heart This was no sooner said than all of us declared against the proposal and miss Jenny our other female passenger observed that if captain Weazel and his lady had a mind to sup by themselves they might  wait until we should have doneAt this the captain put on a martial frown and looked very big without speaking while his yokefellow with a disdainful toss of her nose muttered something about  "Creature"  which miss Jenny overhearing stept up to her saying  "None of your names good Mrs Abigailcreature quothaI'll assure youNo such creature as you neitherno ten pound sneakerno quality coupler"  Here the captain interposed with a  "Damme madam what d'ye mean by that"  "Damn you sir who are you replied miss Jenny who made you a captain you pitiful trencherscraping pimping curler'Sdeath the army is come to a fine pass when such fellows as you get commissionsWhat I suppose you think I don't know youBy Gd you and your helpmate are well meta castoff mistress and a bald  valet de chambre  are well yoked together Blood and wounds cried Weazel d'ye question the honour of my wife madamHell and damnation No man in England durst say so muchI would flea him carbonado him Fury and destruction I would have his liver for my supper"  So saying he drew his sword and flourished with it to the great terror of Strap while miss Jenny snapping her fingers told him she did not value his resentment a ftIn the midst of this quarrel the master of the waggon alighted who understanding the cause of it and fearing the captain and his lady would take so much umbrage as to leave his carriage was at great pains to have every thing made up which he at last accomplished and we sat down to supper all together At bedtime  we were shewn to our apartments The old usurer Strap and I were conducted to one room the captain his wife and miss Jenny to anotherAbout midnight my companion's bowels being disordered he got up in order to go backward in his return mistaking one door for another he entered Weazel's chamber and without any hesitation went to bed to his wife who was fast asleep the captain being at another end of the room groping for some empty vessel his own chamberpot being leaky As he did not perceive Strap coming in he went toward his own bed after having sound a convenience but no sooner did he feel a rough head with a cotton nightcap on it than it came into his mind that he was got to miss Jenny's bed instead of his own and that the head he felt was that of some gallant with whom she had made an assignationFull of this conjecture and scandalized at the prostitution of his apartment he snatched up the vessel he had just before filled and emptied it at once on the astonished barber and his own wife who waking at that instant broke forth into lamentable cries which not only alarmed the husband beyond measure but frightened poor Strap almost out of his senses for he verily believed himself bewitched especially when the incensed captain seized him by the throat with a volley of oaths asking him how he durst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of his wifePoor Strap was so amazed and confounded that he could say nothing but  "I take God to witness she's a virgin for me"  Mrs Weazel enraged to find herself in such a pickle through the precipitation of her husband got up in her shift and with the heel  of her shoe which she found at the bedside belaboured the captain's bald pate till he cried  "Murder"  "I'll teach you to empty your stinkpots on me cried she you pitiful hop o' my thumb coxcombWhat I warrant you're jealous you man of lathWas it for this I condescended to take you to my bed you poor withered sapless twig"  The noise occasioned by this adventure had brought the master of the waggon and me to the door where we overheard all that passed with great satisfaction In the mean time we were alarmed with the cry of  "Rape Murder Rape"  which miss Jenny pronounced with great vociferation  "O you vile abominable old villain said she would you rob me of my virtueBut I'll be revenged of you you old goat I willhelp for heaven's sake helpI shall be ravished ruined help"  Some servants of the inn hearing this cry came running up stairs with lights and such weapons as chance afforded when we beheld a very diverting sceneIn one corner stood the poor captain shivering in his shirt which was all torn to rags with a woful visage scratched all over by his wise who had by this time wrapt the covering about her and sat crying on the side of her bedIn the other end lay the old usurer sprawling on miss Jenny's bed with nothing on him but his flannel jacket over his shirt and his tawny meagre limbs exposed to the air while she held him fast by the two ears and loaded him with execrationsWhen we asked what was the matter she affected to weep and told us she was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined her in her sleep and  bid us take notice of what we saw for she intended to make use of our evidence against himThe poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive and begged for Christ's sake to be released which was no sooner done than he protested she was no woman but a devil incarnatethat she had first seduced his flesh to rebel and then betrayed him  "Yes cockatrice continued he with a faultering voice thou knowest thou did'st spread this snare for mebut thou shalt not succeedfor I will hang myself before thou shalt get a farthing of me"  So saying he crawled to his own bed groaning all the wayWe then advanced to the captain who told us  "Gentlemen here has been a damn'd mistake but I'll be revenged on him who was the occasion of itThat Scotchman who carries the knapsack shall not breathe this vital air another day if my name be WeazelMy dear I ask you ten thousand pardons you are sensible I could mean no harm to you"  "I know not what you meant replied she sobbing but I know I have got enough to send me to my grave"  At length they were reconciledThe wife was complimented with a share of miss Jenny's bed her own being overflowed and the master of the waggon invited Weazel to sleep the remaining part of the night with him I retired to mine where I found Strap mortally afraid he having got away in the dark while the captain and his lady were at loggerheads  CHAP XII  Captain Weazel challenges Strap who declines the combatan affair between the captain and methe usurer is fain to give miss Jenny five guineas for a releasewe are in danger of losing a mealthe behaviour of Weazel Jenny and Joey on that occasionan account of captain Weazel and his ladythe captain's courage triedIsaac's mirth at the captain's expence  NEXT morning I agreed to give the master of the waggon ten shillings for my passage to London provided Strap should be allowed to take my place when I should be disposed to walkAt the same time I desired him to appease the incensed captain who by this time had got into the kitchen with a drawn sword in his hand and threatned with many oaths to sacrifice the villain who attempted to violate his bed but it was to no purpose for the master to explain the mistake and assure him of the poor lad's innocence who stood trembling behind me all the while the more submission that appeared in Strap the more implacable seemed the resentment of Weazel who swore he must either fight him or he would instantly put him to deathI was extremely provoked at this insolence and told him it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at his own  weapon but I was persuaded he would wrestle or box with himTo which proposal Strap immediately gave assent by saying he would box with him for a guineaWeazel replied with a look of disdain it was beneath any gentleman of his character to fight like a porter or even to put himself on a footing in any respect with such a fellow as Strap  "Ods bodikins cries Joey sure coptain yaw wauld not coommit moorder Here's a poor lad that is willing to make attoonement for his offence and an that woant't satisfie yaw offers to fight yaw fairlyAn yaw woan't box I dare say he will coodgel with yawWoan't yaw my lad"  Strap after some hesitation answered  "Yeyes I'll cudgel with him"  But this expedient being also rejected by the captain I began to smell his character and tipping Strap the wink told the company that I had always heard it said the person who receives a challenge should have the choice of the weapons this therefore being the rule in point of honour I would venture to promise on the head of my companion that he would even fight captain Weazel at sharps but it should be with such sharps as Strap was best acquainted with namely razorsAt my mentioning razors I could perceive the captain's colour to change while Strap pulling me by the sleeve whispered with great eagerness  "No no no for the love of God don't make any such bargain"  At length Weazel recovered himself turned towards me and with a ferocious countenance asked  "Who the devil are youwill you fight me"  With these words putting himself in a posture I was grievously alarmed at  seeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast and springing to one side snatched up a spit that stood in the chimney corner with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay who made a great many half longes skipping backward every time till at last I got him pinned up in a corner to the no small diversion of the company While he was in this situation his wife entered and seeing her husband in these dangerous circumstances uttered a dreadful scream and swooned Upon this Weazel demanded a cessation which was immediately granted and after his lady had recovered was contented with the submission of Strap who falling on his knees before him protested the innocence of his intention and asked pardon for the mistake he had committed This affair being ended without bloodshed we went to breakfast but missed two of our company to wit miss Jenny and the usurer As for the first Mrs Weazel informed us that she had kept her awake all night with her groans and that when she got up this morning miss Jenny was so much indisposed that she could not proceed on her journeyAt this moment a message came from her to the master of the waggon who immediately went into her chamber followed by us allShe told him in a lamentable tone that she was afraid of a miscarriage owing to the fright she received last night from the brutality of Isaac and as the event was uncertain desired the usurer might be detained to answer for the consequenceAccordingly this ancient Tarquin was found in the waggon whither he had retired to avoid the shame of last night's disgrace and brought by force into her presenceHe no sooner appeared than  she began to weep and sigh most piteously and told us if she died she would leave her blood upon the head of that ravisherPoor Isaac turning up his eyes and hands to heaven prayed that God would deliver him from the machinations of that Jezabel and assured us with tears in his eyes that his being found in bed with her was the result of her own invitationThe waggoner understanding the case advised Isaac to make it up by giving her a sum of money to which he replied with great vehemence  "A sum of moneya halter for the cockatrice"  "O 'tis very well said miss Jenny I see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his by fair meansJoey be so good as to go to the Justice and tell him there is a sick person here who wants to see him on an affair of consequence"  At the name of justice Isaac trembling like an aspenleaf and bidding Joey stay asked with a faultering voice  "what she would have"  She told him that as he had not perpetrated his wicked purpose she would be satisfied with a small matterAnd though the damage she might sustain in her health might be irreparable she would give him a release for an hundred guineas  "An hundred guineas cried he in an extasy an hundred furiesWhere should a poor old wretch like me have an hundred guineas if I had so much money d'ye think I would be found travelling in a waggon at this season of the year"  "Come come replied Jenny None of your miserly artifice hereYou think I don't know Isaac Rapine the moneybroker in the MinoriesAh you old rogue many a pawn have you had from me and my acquaintance which was never redeemed"  Isaac finding it was in vain to disguise himself offered twenty shillings for a discharge which she absolutely refused under fifty pounds At last however she was brought down to five which he paid with great reluctancy rather than be prosecuted for a rapeAfter which this sick person made shift to get into the waggon and we set forwards in great tranquillity Strap being accommodated with Joey's horse the driver himself chusing to walkThis morning and forenoon we were entertained with an account of the valour of captain Weazel who told us of his having once knocked down a soldier that made game of him of tweaking a drawer by the nose who found fault with his picking his teeth with a fork and of his sending a challenge to a cheesemonger who had the presumption to be his rivalfor the truth of which he appealed to his wifeShe confirmed whatever he said and observed such a thing happened that day  "I received a loveletter from 'squire Gobbleand don't you remember my dear I was prodigiously sick that very night with eating ortolans when my lord Diddle took notice of my complexion's being altered and my lady was so alarmed that she had well nigh fainted"  "Yes my dear replied the captain you know my lord said to me with a sneer"  "Billy Mrs Weazel is certainly breeding"  "And I answered cavalierly My lord I wish I could return the complimentUpon which the whole company broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter and my lord who loves a repartée dearly came round and bussed me"  We travelled in this manner five days  without interruption or meeting any thing worth notice Miss Jenny who soon recovered her spirits entertaining us every day with diverting songs of which she could sing a great number and rallying her old gallant who notwithstanding could never be reconciled to herOn the sixth day while we were about to sit down to dinner the innkeeper came and told us that three gentlemen just arrived had ordered the victuals to be carried to their apartment altho' he had informed them that they were bespoke by the passengers in the waggon To which they had replied  "The passengers in the waggon might be damn'dtheir betters must be served before themthey supposed it would be no hardship on such travellers to dine upon bread and cheese for one day"  This was a terrible disappointment to us all and we laid our heads together how to remedy it when miss Jenny propose that captain Weazel being by profession a soldier ought in this case to protect and prevent us from being insultedBut the captain excused himself saying he would not for the world be known to have travelled in a waggon swearing at the same time th  he appear with honour they should eat his sword sooner than his provisionUpon this declaration miss Jenny snatching his sword drew it and run immediately to the kitchin where she threatned to put the cook to death if he did not send the victuals into our chamber immediatelyThe noise she made brought the three strangers down one of whom no sooner perceived her than he cried out  "Ha Jenny Ramper what the devil brought thee hither"  "My dear Jack Rattle replied she running into his arms  is it youThen Weazel may go to hell for a dinnerI shall dine with you"  They consented to this with a grat deal of joy and we were on the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal when Joey understanding the whole affair entered the kitchin with a pitchfork in his hand swore he would be the death of any man who should pretend to seize the victuals prepared for the waggonThis menace had like to have produced fatal consequences the three strangers drawing their swords and being joined by their servants and we ranging ourselves on the side of Joey when the landlord interposing offered to part with his own dinner to keep the peace which was accepted by the strangers and we sat down at table without any further molestationIn the afternoon I chose to walk along with Joey and Strap took my placeHaving entered into conversation with this driver I soon found him to be a merry facetious goodnatured fellow and withal very arch He informed me that miss Jenny was a common girl upon the town who falling into company with a recruiting officer he carried her down in the stagecoach from London to Newcastle where he had been arrested for debt and was now in prison upon which she was fain to return to her former way of life in the manner we found herHe told me likewise that one of the gentlemen's servants whom we left at the inn having accidentally seen Weazel immediately knew him and acquainted Joey with some particulars of his character as follows That he had served my lord Frizzle in quality of  valet de chambre  many years while he lived separate from his lady But upon their reconciliation she expresly insisted  upon Weazel's being turned off as well as the woman he kept whereupon his lordship to get rid of them both with a good grace proposed that he should marry his mistress and he would procure a commission for him in the army this expedient was agreed to and Weazel is now by his lordship's interest ensign in's regiment I found he and I had the same sentiments with regard to Weazel's courage which we resolved to put to the trial by alarming the passengers with the cry of  "an highwayman"  as soon as we should discover an horseman appear This we put in practice towards the dusk when we descried a man on horseback approaching us Joey had no sooner intimated to the people in the waggon that he was afraid we should be all robbed than a general consternation arose Strap jumped out of the waggon and hid himself behind a hedge The usurer put forth ejaculations and made a rustling among the straw which made us conjecture he had hid something under it Mrs Weazel wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries and the captain to our great amazement began to snore but this artifice did not succeed for miss Jenny shaking him by the shoulder bawl'd out  "'Sdeath captain is this a time to snore when we are going to be robbedGet up for shame and behave like a soldier and a man of honour"  Weazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed and swore he would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in England surrounded him  "Dn my blood what are you afraid of continued he"  at the same time trembling with such agitation that the whole carriage shookThis singular piece of behaviour incensed  miss Ramper so much that she cried out  "Dn your pitiful soul you are as arrant a poltroon as ever was drummed out of a regimentStop the waggon Joeylet me get out and by Gd if I have rhetorick enough the thief shall not only take your purse but your skin also"  So saying she leapt out with great agilityBy this time the horseman came up with us and happened to be a gentleman's servant well known to Joey who communicated our scheme and desired him to carry it on a little further by going up to the waggon and questioning those within itThe stranger consenting for the sake of diversion approached it and in a terrible tone demanded  "Who have you got here"  Isaac replied with a lamentable voice  "Here is a poor miserable sinner who has got a small family to maintain and nothing in the world wherewithal but these fifteen shillings which if you rob me of we must all starve together"  "Who's that sobbing in the other corner" said the supposed highwayman  "A poor unfortunate woman answered Mrs Weazel upon whom I beg you for Christ's sake to have compassion"  "Are you maid or wife" said he  "Wife to my sorrow" cried she  "Who or where is your husband" continued he  "My husband replied Mrs Weazel is an officer in the army and was left sick at the last inn where we dined"  "You must be mistaken madam said he for I myself saw him get into the waggon this afternoonBut pray what smell is that Sure your lapdog has befoul'd himselflet me catch hold of the nasty cur I'll teach him better manners"  Here he laid hold of one of Weazel's legs and pulled him from under his wife's petticoats where he had concealed himselfThe poor trembling captain being detected in this inglorious situation rubbed his eyes and affecting to wake out of sleep cried  "What's the matterWhat's the matter"  "The matter is not much answered the horseman I only called in to enquire after your health and so adieu most noble captain"  Having said this he clapped spurs to his horse and was out of sight in a momentIt was some time before Weazel could recollect himself but at length reassuming the big look he said  "Damn the fellow why did he ride away before I had time to ask how his lord and lady doDon't you remember Tom my dear"  x addressing himself to his wife  "Yes replied she I think I do remember something of the fellowbut you know I seldom converse with people of his station"  "Hoy day cried Joey do yaw knaw the young mon coptain"  "Know him said Weazel many a time has he filled a glass of Burgundy for me at my lord Trippit's table"  "And what may his neame be coptain" said Joey  "His namehis name replied Weazel is Tom Rinser  "Waunds cried Joey a has changed his true neame then for I'se lay any wager he was christened John Trotter"  This observation raised the laugh against the captain who seemed very much disconcerted when Isaac broke silence and said  "It was no matter who or what he was since he had not proved the robber we suspectedAnd that we ought to bless God for our narrow escape"  "Bless  God said Weazel bless the devil for what had he been a highwayman I should have eat his blood body and guts before he had robbed me or any one in this  Diligence  "  "Ha ha ha cried miss Jenny I believe you will eat all you kill indeed captain"  The usurer was so pleased at the event of this adventure that he could not refrain from being severe and took notice that captain Weazel seemed to be a good Christian for he had armed himself with patience and resignation instead of carnal weapons and worked out his salvation with fear and tremblingThis piece of satire occasioned a great deal of mirth at Weazel's expence who muttered a great many oaths and threatned to cut Isaac's throatwhich the usurer taking hold of said  "Gentlemen and ladies I take you all to witness that my life is in danger from this bloodyminded officerI'll have him bound over to the peace"  This second sneer procured another laugh against him and he remained crestfallen during the remaining part of our journey  CHAP XIII  Strap and I are terrified by an apparitionStrap's conjecturethe mystery explained by Joeywe arrive at Londonour dress and appearance describedwe are insulted in the streetan adventure in the alehousewe are imposed upon by a waggish footmanset to rights by a tobacconisttake lodgingsdive for a dinneran accident at our ordinary  WE arrived at our inn supped and went to bed but Strap's distemper continuing he was obliged to get up in the middle of the night and taking the candle in his hand which he had left burning for the purpose he went down to the house of office whence in a short time he returned in a great hurry with his hair standing on end and a look betokening horror and astonishment Without speaking a word he set down the light and jumped into bed behind me where he lay and trembled with great violenceWhen I asked him what was the matter he replied with a broken accent  "God have mercy on us I have seen the devil"  Though my prejudice was not quite so strong as his I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation and much more so when I heard the sound of bells approaching our chamber and felt my bedfellow cling close to me uttering these words  Christ have mercy upon us there he comesAt that instant a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber with bells at its feet and made directly towards our bedAs this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in I verily believed we were haunted and in a violent fright shrunk my head under the bedcloathsThis terrible apparition leapt upon the bed and after giving us several severe dabbs with its beak through the blankets hopped away and vanished Strap and I recommended ourselves to the protection of heaven with great devotion and when we no longer heard the noise ventured to peep up and take breathBut we had not been long freed from this phantom when another appeared that had well nigh deprived us both of our senses We perceived an old man enter the room with a long white beard that reached to his middle there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance that did not savour of this world and his dress consisted of a brown stuff coat buttoned behind and at the wrists and an oddfashioned cap of the same stuff upon his headI was so amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object but lay motionless and saw him come streight up to me when he got to the bed he wrung his hands and cried with a voice that did not seem to belong to a human creature  "Where is Ralph"  I made no reply upon which he repeated in an accent still more preternatural  "Where is Ralpho"  He had no sooner pronounced these words than I heard the sound of the bells at a distance which the apparition having listened to tript away and left me almost petrified with  fear It was a good while before I could recover myself so far as to speak and when at length I turned about to Strap I found him in a fit which however did not last longWhen he came to himself I asked his opinion of what had happened and he assured me that the first must certainly be the soul of some person damned which appeared by the chains about its legs for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigness of a horse and the sound of small morris bells to the clanking of massy chainsAs for the old man he took it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago in this place which had power granted it to torment the assassin in the shape of a raven and that Rapho was the name of the said murdererAlthough I had not much faith in his interpretation I was too much troubled to enjoy any sleep and in all my future adventures never passed a night so illIn the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey who after an immoderate fit of laughter explained the matter by telling him that the old man was the landlord's father who had turned idiot some years ago and diverted himself with a tame raven which it seems had hopped away from his apartment in the night and induced him to follow it to our chamber where he had inquired after it under the name of Ralpho  Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey which continued six or seven days longer At length we entered the great city and lodged all night at the inn where the waggon haltedNext morning all the passengers parted different ways while my companion and I sallied out to enquire for the member of parliament to whom I had a letter of recommendation  from Mr Crab As we had discharged our lodging at the inn Strap took up our baggage and marched behind me in the street with the knapsack on his back as usual so that we made a very whimsical appearanceI had dressed myself to the greatest advantage that is put on a clean ruffled shirt my best thread stockings my hair which was of the deepest red hung down upon my shoulders as lank and streight as a pound of candles and the skirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg my waistcoat and breeches were of the same piece and cut in the same taste my hat very much resembled a Barber's bason in the shallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brims Strap was habited in a much less aukward manner than me but a short crop eared wig that very much resembled Scrub's in the play and the knapsack on his back added to what is called a queer phiz occasioned by a long chin an hook nose and high cheek bones rendered him on the whole a very fit subject of mirth and pleasantry As we walked along Strap at my desire enquired of a carman whom we met whereabouts Mr Cringer livedand was answered by a stare accompanied with the word  "Anan"  Upon which I came up in order to explain the question but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewise the carman damning us for a lousy Scotch guard and whipping up his horses with a  "Gee ho"  which nettled me to the quick and roused the indignation of Strap so far that after the fellow was gone a good way he told me he would fight him for a farthingWhile we were deliberating what was next to be done an hackney coachman driving softly along and perceiving  us standing by the kennel came up close to us and calling  "A coach master"  by a dexterous management of the reins made his horses stumble in the wet and bedaub us all over with mudAfter which he drove on applauding himself with a hearty laugh in which several people joined to my great mortification but one more compassionate than the rest seeing us strangers advised me to go into an alehouse and dry myself I thanked him for his advice which I immediately complied with and going into the house he pointed out called for a pot of beer and sat down by the fire in a public room where we cleaned ourselves as well as we couldIn the mean time a wag who sat in a box smoaking his pipe understanding by our dialect who we were came up to me and with a very grave countenance asked me how long I had been caught As I did not know the meaning of his question I made no answer and he went on saying it could not be a great while for my tail was not yet cut at the same time taking hold of my hair and tipping the wink to the rest of the company which seemed highly entertained with his witI was incensed at this usage but afraid of resenting it because I happened to be in a strange place and perceived the person who spoke to me was a brawny fellow for whom I was by no means a match However Strap having either more courage or less caution could not put up with the insults that I suffered but told him with a peremptory tone  "He was an uncivil fellow for making so free with his betters"  Whereupon the wit going toward him asked  "What he had got in his knapsack"  Is it oatmeal or brimstone Sawney  said he seizing him by the chin which he shook to the inexpressible diversion of all presentMy companion feeling himself assaulted in such an opprobrious manner disengaged himself in a trice and lent his antagonist such a box on the ear as made him stagger to the other side of the room and in a moment a ring was formed for the combatantsSeeing Strap beginning to strip and my blood being heated with indignation which banished all other thoughts I undressed myself to the skin in an instant and declared that as the affront that occasioned the quarrel was offered to me I would fight it out myself upon which one or two cried out  "That's a brave Scotch boy you shall have fair play by Gd"  This gave me fresh spirits and going up to my adversary who by his pale countenance did not seem much inclined to the battle I struck him so hard on the stomach that he reeled over a bench and fell to the ground Here I attempted to get atop of him in order to improve my success according to the manner of my own country but was restrained by the spectators one of whom endeavoured to raise up my opponent but in vain for he protested he would not fight not being quite recovered of a late illnessI was very well pleased with this excuse and immediately dressed myself having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery as did also my comrade Strap who shook me by the hand and wished me joy of the victoryAfter having drank our pot and dried our cloaths we enquired of the landlord if he knew Mr Cringer the member of parliament and were amazed at his replying in the negative for we imagined he must be  every bit as conspicuous here as in the borough he represented but he told us we might possibly hear of him as we passed alongWhereupon we betook ourselves to the street where seeing a footman standing at a door we made up to him and asked if he knew where our patron livedThis member of the partycoloured sraternity surveying us both very minutely said he knew Mr Cringer very well and bid us turn down the first street on our left then turn to the right and then to the left again after which we would observe a lane through which we must pass and at the other end we should find an alley that leads to another street where we should see the sign of the thistle and three pedlars and there he lodgedWe thanked him for his information and went forwards Strap telling me that he knew this person to be an honest friendly man by his countenance before he opened his mouth in which opinion I acquiesced ascribing his good manners to the company he daily saw in the house where he servedWe followed his directions punctually in turning to the left and to the right and to the left again but instead of seeing a lane before us we found ourselves at the side of the river which perplexed us not a little and my fellow traveller ventured to pronounce that we had certainly missed our wayBy this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk and not knowing how to proceed I went into a sm  ll snuffshop hard by encouraged by the sign of the highlander where I found to my inexpressible satisfaction the shopkeeper my countrymanHe was no sooner informed of our peregrination and the directions we had received  from the footman than he informed us we had been imposed upon telling us that Mr Cringer lived in the other end of the town and that it would be to no purpose for us to go thither today for by that time he was gone to the HouseI then asked him if he could recommend us to a lodging which he readily did by giving us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler's shop not far from St Martin's Lane here we hired a bedroom up two pair of stairs at the rate of  s per  week so very small that when the bed was let down we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment and use the bedstead by way of chairsAbout dinnertime our landlord asked us how we proposed to live to which we answered that we would be directed by him  "Well then says he there are two ways of eating in this town for people of your condition the one more creditable and expensive than the other the first is to dine at an eatinghouse frequented by well dressed people only and the other is called diving practised by those who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally"  I gave him to understand that provided the last was not infamous it would suit much better with our circumstances than the other  "Infamous cried he God forbid there are many creditable people and rich people ay and fine people that dive every dayI have seen many a pretty gentleman bedaubed all over with lace dine in that manner very comfortably for three pence halfpenny and go afterwards to the coffeehouse where he made a figure with the best lord in the landbut  your own eyes shall bear witnessI will go along with you today and introduce you"  He accordingly carried us to a certain lane where stopping he bid us observe him and do as he did and walking a few paces dived into a cellar and disappeared in an instantI followed his example and descended very successfully where I found myself in the middle of a cook's shop almost suffocated with the steams of boil'd beef and surrounded by a company consisting chiefly of hackneycoachmen chairmen draymen and a few footmen out of place or on board wages who sat eating shin of beef tripe cowheel or sausages at separate boards covered with cloths which turned my stomachWhile I stood in amaze undetermined whether to sit down or walk upwards again Strap in his descent missing one of the steps tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary and overturned the cook as she was carrying a porringer of soup to one of the guests In her fall she dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot guards who happened to be in her way and scalded him so miserably that he started up and danced up and down uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair stand on end While he entertained the company in this manner with an eloquence peculiar to himself the cook got up and after a hearty curse on the poor author of this mischance who lay under the table scratching his rump with a woful countenance emptied a saltseller in her hand and stripping down the patient's stocking which brought the skin along with it applied the contents to the soreThis poultice was scarce laid on when the drummer who had  begun to abate of his exclamation broke forth into such a hideous yell as made the whole company tremble then seizing a pewter pintpot that stood by him squeezed the sides of it together as if it had been made of pliant leather grinding his teeth at the same time with a most horrible grin Guessing the cause of this violent transport I bid the woman wash off the salt and bathe the part with oil which she did and procured him immediate ease But here another difficulty occurred which was no other than the landlady's insisting on his paying for the pot he had rendered useless he swore he would pay for nothing but what he had eat and bid her be thankful for his moderation or else he would prosecute her for damagesStrap foreseeing it would all land at him promised to satisfy the cook and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer with which entirely appeased him and composed all animosities After this our landlord and we sat down at a board and dined upon shin of beef most deliciously our reckoning amounting to two pence halfpenny each bread and small beer included  CHAP XIV  We visit Strap's frienda description of himhis advicewe go to Mr Cringer's houseare denied admittancean accident befals Straphis behaviour thereuponan extraordinary adventure occurs in the course of which I lose all my money  IN the afternoon my companion proposed to to call at his friend's house which we were informed was in the neighbourhood whither we accordingly went and were so lucky as to find him at home This gentleman who had come from Scotland three or four years ago kept a school in town where he taught the Latin French and Italian languages but what he chiefly professed was the pronounciation of the English tongue after a method more speedy and uncommon than any practised heretofore and indeed if his scholars spoke like their master the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle for although I could easily understand every word of what I had heard hitherto since I entered England three parts in four of his dialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had spoke in Arabick or IrishHe was a middlesized man and stooped very much though not above the age of forty his face was very much pitted with the smallpox his eyes blear'd and his mouth extended from ear to earHe was dressed in a  nightgown of plaid fastened about his middle with a serjeant's old sash and a tieperriwig with a foretop three inches high in the fashion of king Charles the second's reignAfter he had received Strap who was related to him very courteously he enquired of him who I was and being informed took me by the hand telling me he was at school with my fatherWhen he understood my situation he assured me that he would do me all the service in his power both by his advice and otherwise and while he spoke these words he eyed me with great attention walking round me several times and muttering  "O Chst O Chst fat a saight is here"  I soon guessed the reason of of his ejaculation and said  "I suppose sir you are not pleased with my dress"  "Dress answered he you may caal it fat you please in your country but I vaw to Gad 'tis a masquerade hereNo christian will admit such a figure into his hawseUpon my conscience I wonder the dogs did not hunt youDid you pass through St James's marketGod bless my eyesaight you look like a cousingerman of Ouran Outang"  I began to be a little serious at this discourse and asked him if he thought I should obtain entrance tomorrow at the house Mr Cringer on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction into business  "Mr Cringer Mr Cringer replied he scratching his cheek may be a very honest gentlemanI know nothing to the contrary but is your sole dependance upon himWho recommended you to him"  I pulled out Mr Crab's letter and told him the foundation of my hopes at which he stared at me and repeated  "O Chst"  I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his and begged he would assist me with his advice which he promised to do very frankly and as a specimen directed us to a perriwig warehouse in the neighbourhood in order to be accommodated laying strong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr Cringer till I had parted with these carroty locks which he said were sufficient to beget an antipathy against me in all mankindAnd as we were going to pursue this advice he called me back and bid me be sure to deliver my letter into Mr Cringer's own handAs we walked along Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend who it seems had assured him he would in a day or two provide for him with some good master and  "now says he you shall see how I will fit you with a wigThere's ne'er a barber in London and that's a bold word can palm a rotten caul or a pennyweight of dead hair upon me"  And indeed this zealous adherent did wrangle so long with the merchant that he was desired twenty times to leave the shop and see if he could get one cheaper elsewhere At length I made choice of a good handsome bob for which I paid fifteen shillings and returned to our lodging where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had given the schoolmaster so much offence  We got up next day betimes having been informed that Mr Cringer gave audience by candlelight to all his dependants he himself being obliged to attend the levee of my lord Terrier at break of day because his lordship made one at the minister's between eight and nine aclockWhen we came to Mr Cringer's door  Strap to give me an instance of his politeness run to the knocker which he employed so loud and so long that he alarmed the whole street and a window opening up two pair of stairs in the next house a chamberpot was discharged upon him so successfully that the poor barber was wet to the skin while I being luckily at some distance escaped the unsavoury delugeIn the mean time a footman opening the door and seein no body in the street but us asked with a stern countenance if it was I who made such a damned noise and what I wantedI told him I had business with his master whom I desired to seeUpon which he clapt the door in my face telling me I must learn better manners before I could have access to his master Vexed at this disappointment I turned my resentment against Strap whom I sharply reprimanded for his presumption but he not in the least regarding what I said wrung the urine out of his perriwig and lifting up a large stone flung it with such force against the streetdoor of that house from whence he had been bedewed that the lock giving way it flew wide open and he took to his heels leaving me to follow him as I couldIndeed there was no time for deliberation I therefore pursued him with all the speed I could exert until we found ourselves about the dawn in a street we did not know Here as we wandered along gaping about a very decent sort of a man passing by me stopped of a sudden and took up something which having examined he turned and presented it to me with these words  "Sir you have dropt half a crown"  I was not a little surprized at this instance of honesty and told him it did not belong to me but he  bid me recollect and see if all my money was safe upon which I pulled out my purse for I had bought one since I came to town and reckoning my money in my hand which was now reduced to five guineas seven shillings and two pence I assured him I had lost nothing  "Well then says he so much the betterthis is Godsendand as you two were present when I picked it up you are entitled to equal shares with me"  I was astonished at these words and looked upon this person to be a prodigy of integrity but absolutely refused any part of the sum  "Come gentlemen said he you are too modestI see you are strangersbut you shall give me leave to treat you with a whet this cold raw morning"  I would have declined this invitation but Strap whispered to me that the gentleman would be affronted and I complied  "Where shall we go said the stranger I am quite ignorant of this part of the town"  I informed him that we were in the same situation Upon which he proposed to go into the first public house we should find open As we walked together he began in this manner  "I find by your tongues you are come from Scotland gentlemenMy grandmother by the father's side was of your country which has prepossessed me so much in its favour that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warmsThe Scots are a very brave peopleThere is scarce a great family in the kingdom that cannot boast of some exploits performed by its ancestors many hundred years agoThere's your Douglasses Gordons Campbels HamiltonsWe have no such ancient families here in EnglandThen you  are all very well educatedI have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well as if they had been his mother tongueAnd for honestyI once had a servant his name was Gregory Macgregor I would have trusted him with untold gold"  This eulogium on my native country gained my affection so strongly that I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author and Strap's eyes swam in tears At length as we passed through a dark narrow lane we perceived a public house which we entered and found a man sitting by the fire smoaking a pipe with a pint of purl before himOur new acquaintance asked us if ever we had drank egg flip to which we answering in the negative he assured us of a regale and ordered a quart to be prepared calling for pipes and tobacco at the same time We found this composition very palatable and drank heartily the conversation which was introduced by the gentleman turning upon the snares that young unexperienced people are exposed to in this metropolisHe described a thousand cheats that are daily practised upon the ignorant and unwary and warned us of them with so much goodnature and concern that we blessed the opportunity which threw us into his wayAfter we had put the cann about for some time our new friend began to yawn telling us he had been up all night with a sick person and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to keep him awake  "Suppose said he we should take a hand at whist for pastimeBut let me see that won't do there's only three of us and I cannot play at any other gameThe truth is I seldom or never play but out of complaisance  or at such a time as this when I am in danger of falling asleep"  Although I had no great inclination for gaming I felt no aversion to pass an hour or two at cards with a friend and knowing that Strap understood as much of the matter as I made no scruple of saying  "I wish we could find a fourth hand"  While we were in this perplexity the person whom we found at our entrance overhearing our discourse took the pipe from his mouth very gravely and accosted us thus  "Gentlemen my pipe is out you see shaking the ashes into the fire and rather than you should be baulked I don't care if I take a hand with you for a triflebut remember I won't play for any thing of consequence"  We accepted his profer with pleasure and having cut for partners it fell to my lot to play with him against our friend and Strap for three pence a gameWe were so successful that in a short time I was half a crown gainer when the gentleman whom we had met in the street observing he had no luck today proposed to leave off or change partnersBy this time I was inflamed with my good fortune and the expectation of improving it as I perceived the two strangers plaid but indifferently therefore I voted for giving him his revenge with which he complied after some intreaty and cutting again Strap and I to our mutual satisfaction happened to be partnersMy good fortune attended me still and in less than an hour we had got thirty shillings of their money for as they lost they grew the keener and doubled stakes every time At last the inconstant goddess began to veer about and we were very soon stript of all our gains and about forty shillings  of our own money This mortified me extremely and had a visible effect on the muscles of Strap's face which lengthened apace but our antagonists perceiving our condition kindly permitted us to retrieve our loss and console ourselves with a new acquisitionThen my companion wisely suggested it was time to begone upon which the person who had joined us in the house began to curse the cards and muttered that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got no part of our success being owing to our good playThis insinuation nettled me so much that I challenged him to continue the game for a crown and he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the invitationThis contest ended in less than an hour to my inexpressible affliction who lost every shilling of my own money Strap absolutely refusing to supply me with a sixpenceThe gentleman at whose request we had come in perceiving by my disconsolate looks the situation of my heart which well nigh bursted with grief and resentment when the other stranger got up and went away with my money began in this manner  "I am truly afflicted at your bad luck and would willingly repair it was it in my powerBut what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long It is always a maxim with gamesters to pursue success as far as it will go and to stop whenever fortune shifts aboutYou are a young man and your passions too impetuous you must learn to govern them betterHowever there is no experience like that which is bought you will be the better for this the longest day you have to liveAs for the fellow who has got  your money I don't half like himDid not you observe me tip you the wink to leave off in time"  I answered No  "No continued he you was too eager to mind any thing but the gameBut harkee said he in a whisper are you satisfied of that young man's honesty his looks are a little suspiciousbut I may be mistakenhe made a great many grimaces while he stood behind youthis is a very wicked town"  I told him I was very well convinced of my comrade's integrity and that the grimaces he mentioned were doubtless owing to his anxiety at my loss  "O ho if that be the case I ask his pardonLandlord see what's to pay"  The reckoning came to eighteen pence which having discharged the gentleman shook us both by the hand and saying he should be very glad to see us again departed  CHAP XV  Strap moralizespresents his purse to mewe inform our landlord of my misfortune who unravels the mysteryI present

at the Navy office and Surgeon'shallStrap is employed  IN our way to our lodging after a profound silence on both sides Strap with a hideous groan observed that we had brought our pigs to a fine market To this I made no reply and he went on  "God send us well out of this place we have not been in London eight and forty hours and I believe we have met with eight and forty thousand misfortunesWe have been jeered reproached buffetted pissed upon and at last stript of our money and I suppose by and by we shall be stript of our skinsIndeed as to the money part of it that was owing to our own folly Solomon says  Bray a fool in a mortar and he will never be wise  Ah God help us an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold"  This was no time for him to tamper with my disposition already mad with my loss and inflamed with resentment  against him who had refused me a little money to attempt to retrieve it I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance and asked him  "Who he called fool"  Being altogether unaccustomed with such looks from me he stood still and stared in my face for some time then with some confusion uttered  "FoolI called no body fool but myselfI am sure I am the greatest fool of the two for being so much concerned at other people's misfortunesbut  Nemo omnibus horis sapit  that's allthat's all"  Upon which a silence ensued that brought us to our lodging where I threw myself into the bed in an agony of despair resolving to perish for want rather than apply to my companion or any other body for relief but Strap who knew my temper and whose heart bled within him at my distress after some pause came to the bedside and putting a leather purse into my hand burst into tears crying  "I know what you think but I scorn your thoughtsThere's all I have in the world take it and I'll perhaps get more for you before that be doneif not I'll beg for you steal for you go through the wide world with you and starve with you for though I be a poor cobler's son I am no scout"  I was so touched with the generous passion of this poor creature that I could not refrain from weeping also and we mingled our tears together for some timeUpon examining the purse I found in it two half guineas and half a crown which I would have returned to him saying he knew better than I how to manage it but he absolutely refused my proposal and told me it was more reasonable and decent that he should depend upon  me who was a gentleman than that I should be controuled by him  After this friendly contest was over and our minds more at ease we informed our landlord of what had happened to us taking care to conceal the extremity to which we were reduced He no sooner heard the story than he assured us we had been grievously imposed upon by a couple of sharpers who were associates and that this polite honest friendly humane person who had treated us so civilly was no other than a rascally moneydropper who made it his business to decoy strangers in that manner to one of his own haunts where an accomplice or two was always waiting to assist in pillaging the prey they had run downHere the good man recounted a great many stories of people who had been seduced cheated pilfered beatnay even murdered by such villains I was confounded at the artifice and wickedness of mankind and Strap listing up his eyes and hands to heaven prayed that God would deliver him from scenes of such iniquity for surely the devil had set up his throne in LondonOur landlord being curious to know what reception we had met with at Mr Cringer's we acquainted him with the particulars at which he shook his head and told us we had not gone the right way to work that there was nothing to be done with a mbr of pmt without a bribe that the servant was commonly infected with the master's disease and expected to be paid for his work as well as his bettersHe therefore advised me to give the footman a shilling the next time I desired admittance to my patron or else I should scarce find an opportunity to deliver my letter Accordingly next morning  when the door was opened I slipt a shilling into his hand and told him I had a letter for his masterI found the good effects of my liberality for the fellow let me in immediately and taking the letter out of my hand desired me to wait in a kind of passage for an answer In this place I continued standing three quarters of an hour during which time I saw a great many young fellows whom I formerly knew in Scotland pass and repass with an air of familiarity in their way to and from the audience chamber while I was fain to stand shivering in the cold and turn my back to them that they might not perceive the lowness of my conditionAt length Mr Cringer came out to see a young gentleman to the door who was no other than 'squire Gawky dressed in a very gay suit of cloaths At parting Mr Cringer shook him by the hand and told him he hoped to have the pleasure of his company at dinner Then turning about towards me asked what were my commands when he understood I was the person who had brought the letter from Mr Crab he affected to recollect my name which however he pretended he could not do till he had consulted the letter again to save him that trouble I told him my name was RandomUpon which he went on  "Ay ay Random Random RandomI think I remember the name"  and very well he might for this very individual Mr Cringer had many a time rode before my grandfather's cloakbag in quality of footman  "Well says he you propose to go on board a man of war as surgeon's mate"  To which I replied by a low bow  "I believe it will be a difficult matter continued he to procure a  warrant there being already such a swarm of Scotch surgeons at the navy office in expectation of the next vacancy that the commissioners are afraid of being torn in pieces and have actually applied for a guard to protect themHowever some ships will soon be put in commission and then we shall see what's to be done"  So saying he left me exceedingly mortified at the different reception Mr Gawky and I had met with from this upstart proud mean member who I imagined would have thought it an happiness to have it in his power to be grateful for the obligations he owed to my family  At my return I was surprized with the agreeable news of Strap's being employed on the recommendation of his friend the schoolmaster by a perriwigmaker in the neighbourhood who allowed him five shillings  per  week besides bed and boardI continued to dance attendance every other morning at the levée of Mr Cringer during a fortnight in which time I became acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and profession who also depended on the member's interest but was treated with much more respect than I both by the servants and master being often admitted into a parlour where there was a fire for the convenience of the better sort of those who waited for himThither I was never permitted to penetrate on account of my appearance which was not at all fashionable but was obliged to stand blowing my fingers in a cold lobby and take the first opportunity of Mr Cringer's going to the door to speak with himOne day while I enjoyed this occasion a person was introduced whom Mr Cringer no  sooner saw then running towards him he saluted him with a bow to the very ground and afterwards shaking him by the hand with great heartiness and familiarity called him his good friend and asked very kindly how Mrs Staytape and the young ladies did then after a whisper which continued some minutes wherein I overheard the word  Honour  repeated several times with great emphasis Mr Cringer introduced me to this gentleman as to a person whose advice and assistance I might depend upon and having given me his direction followed me to the door where he told me I needed not give myself the trouble to call at his house any more for Mr Staytape would do my business for me At that instant my fellow dependant coming out after me overheard the discourse of Mr Cringer and making up to me in the street accosted me very civilly which I looked upon as no small honour considering the figure he made for he was dressed in a blue frock with a gold button a green silk waistcoat trimmed with gold black velvet breeches white silk stockings silver buckles a goldlaced hat a spencer wig and a silver hilted hanger with a fine clouded cane in his hand  "I perceive says he you are but lately come from Scotlandpray what may your business with Mr Cringer beI suppose it is no secretand I may possibly give you some advice that will be serviceable for I have been surgeon's second mate on board of a seventygun ship and consequently know a good deal of the world"  I made no scruple to disclose my situation which when he had learned he shook his head and told me he had been pretty much in the same circumstances about a year ago that he had relied on Cringer's promises  so long that his money which was considerable as well as his credit was quite exhausted and when he wrote to his relations for a fresh supply instead of money he received nothing but reproaches and the epithets of idle debauched fellow That after he had waited at the NavyOffice many months for a warrant to no purpose he was fain to pawn some of his cloaths which raised him a small sum wherewith he bribed the sty who soon procured a warrant for him notwithstanding he had affirmed the same day that there was not one vacancyThat he had gone on board where he remained nine months at the end of which the ship was put out of commission and the company to be paid off in Broadstreet the very next dayThat his relations being reconcil'd to him had charg'd him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr Cringer who had informed them by letter that his interest alone had procured the warrant in obedience to which command he came to his levee every morning as I saw though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful scoundrelIn conclusion he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeon'sHall To which I answered I did not so much as know it was necessary  "Necessary cried he O lord O lord I find I must instruct youcome along with me and I'll give you some information about that matter"  So saying he carried me into an alehouse where he called for some beer and bread and cheese on which we breakfasted While we sat in this place he told me I must first go to the NavyOffice and write to the board desiring them to order a letter for me to the Surgeon'sHall that I may be examined touching my skill in surgery That the Surgeons  after having examined me would give me my qualification sealed up in form of a letter directed to the commissioners which qualification I must deliver to the secretary of the board who would open it in my presence and read the contents After which I must employ my interest to be provided for as soon as possibleThat the expence of his qualification for second mate of a third rate amounted to thirteen shillings exclusive of the warrant which cost him half a guinea and half a crown besides the present to the secretary which consisted of a three pound twelve pieceThis calculation was like a thunderbolt to me whose whole fortune did not amount to twelve shillingsI accordingly made him acquainted with this part of my distress after having thanked him for his information and adviceHe condoled with me on this occasion but bid me be of good chear for he had conceived a friendship for me and would make all things easy'Tis true he was run out at present but tomorrow or next day he was certain of receiving a considerable sum of which he would lend me what would be sufficient to answer my exigences This frank declaration pleased me so much that I pulled out my purse and emptied it before him begging him to take what he pleased for pocket expence until he should receive his own moneyWith a good deal of pressing he was prevailed upon to take five shillings telling me that he might have what money he pleased at any time for the trouble of going into the city but as he had met with me he would deser his going thither till tomorrow when I should go along with him and he would put me in a way of acting for myself without a servile dependance  on that rascal Cringer much less on the lousy taylor to whom I heard him turn you over  "How cried I is Mr Staytape a taylor"  "No less I'll assure you answer'd he and I confess more likely to serve you than the member For provided you can entertain him with politics and conundrums you may have credit with him for as many and as rich cloaths as you please"  I told him I was utterly ignorant of both and so incens'd at Cringer's usage that I would never set my foot within his door againAfter a good deal more conversation my new acquaintance and I parted having made an appointment to meet next day at the same place in order to set out for the cityI went immediately to Strap and related every thing which had happen'd but he did not at all approve of my being so forward to lend money to a stranger especially as we had been already so much impos'd upon by appearances  "However said he if you are sure he is a Scotchman I believe you are safe"  CHAP XVI  My new acquaintance breaks an appointmentI proceed by myself to the NavyOfficeaddress myself to a Person there who assists me with his adviceI write to the boardthey grant me a letter to the Surgeons at the HallI am inform'd of the beau's name and characterI find himhe makes me his confident in an amourdesires me to pawn my linen for his occasionsI recover what I lent himsome curious observations of Strap on that occasionhis vanity  IN the morning I got up and went to the place of rendezvous where I waited two hours in vain and was so exasperated against him for breaking his appointment that I set out for the city by myself in hopes of finding the villain and being reveng'd on him for his perfidyAt length I found myself at the NavyOffice which I entered and saw crowds of young fellows walking below many of whom made no better appearance than myselfI consulted the physiognomy of each and at last made up to one whose countenance I lik'd and ask'd if he could instruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent to the board to obtain an order for examination He answered me in broad Scotch that he would shew me the copy of what he had wrote for himself  by the direction of another who knew the form And accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my perusal and told me that if I was expeditious I might send it in to the board before dinner for they did no business in the afternoon He then went with me to a coffeehouse hard by where I wrote the letter which was immediately delivered to the messenger who told me I might expect an order tomorrow about the same timeHaving transacted this piece of business my mind was a good deal compos'd and as I had met with so much civility from this stranger I desired further acquaintance with him fully resolved however not to be deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beauHe agreed to dine with me at the cook's shop which I frequented and on our way thither carried me to 'Change where I was in some hopes of finding Mr Jackson for that was the name of the person who had broke his appointmentI sought him there to no purpose and on our way to the other end of the town imparted to my companion his behaviour towards me Upon which he gave me to understand that he was no stranger to the name of beau Jack+son so he was called at the NavyOffice altho' he did not know him personally that he had the character of a goodnatur'd careless fellow who made no scruple of borrowing from any body that would lend that most people who knew him believed he had a good enough principle at the bottom but his extravagance was such he would probably never have it in his power to manifest the honesty of his intentionThis account made me sweat for my five shillings which I nevertheless did not altogether despair of recovering provided  I could find out the debtorThis young man likewise added another circumstance of 'Squire Jackson's history which was that being destitute of all means to equip him for sea when he receiv'd his last warrant he had been recommended to a person who lent him a little money after he had signed a will and power entitling that person to lift his wages when they should become due as also to inherit his effects in case of his deathThat he was still under the tutorage and direction of that gentleman who advanced him small sums from time to time upon this security at the rate of  per cent  But at present his credit was very low because his funds would do little more than pay what he had already receiv'd this moderate interest includedAfter the stranger whose name was Thomson had entertain'd me with this account of Jackson he inform'd me that he himself had passed for a third mate of a third rate about four months ago since which time he had constantly attended at the NavyOffice in hopes of a warrant having been assur'd from the beginning both by a Scotch member and one of the commissioners to whom the member recommended him that he should be put into the first vacancy notwithstanding which promise he had had the mortification to see six or seven appointed in the same station almost every weekthat now being utterly impoverish'd his sole hope consisted in the promise of a friend lately come to town to lend him a small matter for a present to the sty without which he was persuaded he might wait a thousand years to no purposeI conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow which I believe proceeded from the similitude of our fortunes We spent the whole day together  and as he lived at Wapping I desir'd him to take a share of my bedNext day we returned to the NavyOffice where after being called before the board and question'd about the place of my nativity and education they order'd a letter to be made out for me which upon paying half a crown to the clerk I receiv'd and deliver'd into the hands of the clerk at Surgeon'sHall together with a shilling for his trouble in registering my nameBy this time my whole stock was diminished to two shillings and I saw not the least prospect of relief even for present subsistence much less to enable me to pay the fees at Surgeon'sHall for my examination which was to happen in a fortnightIn this state of perplexity I consulted Strap who assured me he would pawn every thing he had in the world even to his razors before I should want but this I absolutely rejected telling him I would a thousand times rather list for a soldier of which I had some thoughts than be any longer a burthen to himAt the word soldier he grew pale as death and begged on his knees I would think no more of that scheme  "God preserve us all in our right wits cried he would you turn soldier and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards where you must stand and be shot at like a woodcockHeaven keep cold lead out of my carcass and let me die in a bed like a christian as all my forefathers have doneWhat signifies all the riches and honours of this life if one enjoys not contentAnd in the next there is no respect of persons Better be a poor honest Barber with a good conscience and time to repent of my sins upon my death bed than be cut off  God bless us by a musket shot as it were in the very flower of one's age in the pursuit of riches and fameWhat signifies riches my dear friend do they not make unto themselves wings as the wiseman saith and does not Horace observe  "  Non domus aut fundus non aeris accrvus aut duri Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febrem non animo curas    I could moreover mention many other sayings in contempt of riches both from the bible and other good books but as I know you are not very fond of these things I shall only assure you that if you take on to be a soldier I will do the same and then if we should both be slain you will not only have your own blood to answer for but mine also And peradventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battleTherefore I pray you consider whether you will sit down contented with small things and share the fruits of my industry in peace 'till providence shall send better tidings or by your despair plunge both our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition which God of his infinite mercy forbid"  I could not help smiling at this harangue which was delivered with great earnestness the tears standing in his eyes all the time and promised to do nothing of that sort without his consent and concurrenceHe was much comforted with this declaration and told me in a few days he should receive a week's wages which should be at my service but advised me in the mean time to go in quest of Jackson and recover if possible what he had borrow'd of meI accordingly trudg'd about from one end of the town to the other for several days without  being able to learn any thing certain concerning him And one day being extreamly hungry and allur'd by the steams that regal'd my nostrils from a boiling cellar I went down with an intention to gratify my appetite with twopenny worth of beef when to my no small surprize I found Mr Jackson sitting at dinner with a footmanHe no sooner perceiv'd me than he got up and shook me by the hand saying  "He was glad to see me for he intended to have call'd at my lodgings in the afternoon"  I was so well pleas'd with this rencounter and the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment that I forgot my resentment and sat down to dinner with the happy expectation of not only recovering my own money before we should part but also reaping the benefit of his promise to lend me wherewithal to pass examination and this my sanguine complexion suggested notwithstanding the account Thompson gave me of him ought to have taught me betterWhen we had feasted sumptuously he took his leave of the footman and adjourned with me to an alehouse hard by where after shaking me by the hand again he began thus  "I suppose you think me a sad dog Mr Random and I do confess that appearances are against mebut I dare say you will forgive me when I tell you my not coming at the time appointed was owing to a peremptory message I receiv'd from a certain lady whomharkee but this is a great secret I am to marry very soonYou think this strange perhaps but it is not less true for all thata five thousand pounder I'll assure you besides expectationsFor my own part devil take me if I know what any woman can  see engaging about mebut a whim you knowand then one would not baulk one's good fortuneYou saw that footman who din'd with ushe's one of the honestest fellows that ever wore liveryYou must know it was by his means I was introduced to her for he made me first acquainted with her woman who is his mistressay many a crown has he and his sweetheart had of my moneybut what of that things are now brought to a bearingI havecome a little this way I have propos'd marriage and the day is fix'dshe's a charming creature and writes like an angelO lord she can repeat all the English tragedies as well as e'er a player in DruryLane and indeed is so fond of plays that to be near the stage she has taken lodgings in a court hard by the theatreBut you shall seeyou shall seehere's the last letter she sent me"  With these words he put it into my hand and I read to the best of my remembrance as follows  Dire creatur  AS you are the animable hopjack of my contempleshons your aydear is constantanously skimming before my kimmerical fansie when morfeus sheds illeusinary puppies upon the I's of dreeming mortels and when lustroos febus shines from his kotidian throne Wheerpon I shall consceif old whorie time has lost his pinners as also cubit his harrows until thou enjoy sweet slumbrs in the lovesick harrums of thy faithful to commend 'till death  CLAYRENDER  Vingaryard Droorylane  January th  While I was reading he seemed to be in an extasy rubbing his hands and bursting out into fits of laughter at last he caught hold of my hand and squeezing it cried out  "There is stile for you what do you think of this billet doux"  I answer'd  "It might be sublime for aught I knew for it was altogether above my comprehension"  "O ho said he I believe it isboth tender and sublimeshe's a divine creature and so doats upon meLet me seewhat shall I do with this money when I have once got it into my handsIn the first place I shall do for youI'm a man of few wordsbut say no morethat's determin'dWhether would you advise me to purchase some post by which I may rise in the state or lay out my wife's fortune in land and retire to the country at once"  I gave my opinion without hesitation that he could not do better than buy an estate and improve it especially since he had already seen so much of the world Then I launch'd out into the praises of a country life as describ'd by the poets whose works I had readHe seem'd to relish my advice but withal told me that although he had seen a great deal of the world both at land and sea having cruiz'd three whole months in the channel yet he should not be satisfied until he had visited France which he propos'd to do before he should settle and to carry his wife along with himI had nothing to object to his proposal and ask'd him how soon he hop'd to be happy  "As to that replied he nothing obstructs my happiness but the want of a little ready cashfor you must know my friend in the city has gone out of town for a week or two and I  unfortunately missed my pay at Broadstreet by being detain'd too long by the dear charmerbut there will be a recal at Chatham next week whither the ship's books are sent and I have commission'd a friend in that place to receive the money"  "If that be all said I there's no great harm in deferring your marriage a few days"  "Yes faith but there is replied he you don't know how many rivals I have who would take all advantages against meI would not baulk the impatience of her passion for the worldthe least appearance of coldness and indifference would ruin all and such offers don't occur every day"  I acquiesc'd in this observation and enquir'd how he intended to proceed At this he rubb'd his chin and said  "Why truly I must be oblig'd to some friend or otherdo you know nobody that would lend me a small sum for a day or two"  I assur'd him I was such an utter stranger in London that I did not believe I could borrow a guinea if my life depended upon it  "No said he that's hardthat's hardI wish I had any thing to pawn upon my soul you have got excellent linen feeling the sleeve of my shirt how many shirts of that kind have you got"  I answer'd  "six ruffled and six plain"  At which  testified great surprize and swore that no gentleman ought to have more than four  "How many d'ye think I have got continued he but this and another as I hope to be sav'dI dare say we shall be able to raise a good firm out of your superfluitylet me seelet me seeeach of these shirts are worth eighteen shillings at a moderate computationnow suppose we pawn them  for half priceeight times eight is sixtyfour that's three pound fourzds it will dogive me your hand"  "Softly softly Mr Jackson said I don't dispose of my linen without my consent first pay me the crown you owe me and then we shall talk of other matters"  He protested he had not above one shilling in his pocket but that he would pay me out of the first money raised from the shirtsThis piece of assurance incensed me so much that I swore I would not part with him until I had received satisfaction for what I had lent him and as for the shirts I would not pawn one of them to save him from the gallowsAt this expression he laughed aloud and then complained it was damned hard that I should refuse him a trifle that would infallibly enable him not only to make his own fortune but mine also  "You talk of pawning my shirts said I what would you think of selling this hanger Mr Jackson I believe it would fetch a good round sum"  "No hang it said he I can't appear decently without my hanger or by Gd it should go"  However seeing me inflexible with regard to my linen he at length unbuckled his hanger and shewing me the sign of three blue balls desired me to carry it thither and pawn it for two guineasThis office I would by no means have performed had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise but not willing out of a piece of false delicacy to neglect the only opportunity I should perhaps ever have I ventured into a pawnbroker's shop where I demanded two guineas on the pledge in the name of Thomas Williams  "Two guineas said the pawnbroker looking at the hanger  this piece of goods has been here several times before for thirty shillings however since I believe the gentleman to whom it belongs will redeem it he shall have what he wants"  and accordingly he paid me the money which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson and calling for change I counted out to him seven and thirty shillings reserving the other five for myselfAfter looking at the money some time he said  "Dn it it don't signifythis won't do my business so you may as well take half a guinea or a whole one as the five shillings you have kept"  I thanked him kindly but refused to accept of any more than was my due because I had no prospect of repaying itUpon which he stared in my face and told me I was excessively raw or I would not talk in that manner  "Blood cried he I have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who won't borrow of his friend when he's in want'tis the sign of a speaking spiritCome come Random give me back the five shillings and take this half guinea and if ever you are able to pay me I believe you will if not dn me if ever I ask it"  When I reflected on my present necessity I suffered myself to be persuaded and after making my acknowledgments to Mr Jackson who offered to treat me with a play I returned to my lodgings with a much better opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning and at night imparted my day's adventure to Strap who rejoiced at my good luck saying  "I told you if he was a Scotchman you was safe enoughand who knows but this marriage may make us allYou have heard I suppose as how a countryman  of ours a journeyman baker run away with a great lady of this town and now keeps his coachEcod I say nothing but yesterday morning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house there was a young lady in the rooma fine buxom wench i' faith and she threw so many sheep's eyes at a certain person whom I shall not name that my heart went knock knock knock like a fulling mill and my hand shshshook so much that I sliced a piece of skin off the gentleman's nose whereby he swore a deadly oath and was going to horsewhip me when she prevented him and made my peace  Omen haud malum  Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker The only difference is the baker uses flour for the belly and the barber uses it for the head and as the head is a more noble member than the belly so is a barber more noble than a bakerfor what's the belly without the headBesides I am told he could neither read nor write now you know I can do both And moreover speak LatinBut I will say no more for I despise vanitynothing is more vain than vanity"  With these words he pulled out of his pocket a wax candle's end which he applied to his forehead and upon examination I found he had combed his own hair over the toupee of his wig and was indeed in his whole dress become a very smart shaverI congratulated him on his prospect with a satirical smile which he understood very well and shaking his head observed I had very little faith but the truth would come to light in spite of my incredulity  CHAP XVII  I go to Surgeon'shall where I meet with Mr JacksonI am examineda fierce dispute arises between two of the examinersJackson disguises himself to attract respectis detectedin hazard of being sent to Bridewellhe treats us at a taverncarries us to a nighthouse a troublesome adventure therewe are committed to the Round housecarried before a justicehis behaviour  WITH the assistance of this faithful adherent who gave me almost all the money he earned I preserved my half guinea entire till the day of examination when I went with a trembling heart to Surgeon'shall in order to undergo that ceremonyAmong a croud of young fellows who walked in the outward hall I perceived Mr Jackson to whom I immediately went up and enquiring into the state of his amour understood it was still undetermined by reason of his friend's absence and the delay of the recal at Chatham which put it out of his power to bring it to a conclusionI then asked what his business was in this place to which he replied he was resolved to have twostrings to his bow that in case the one  iled he might use the other and with this view he was to pass that night for a higher qualificationAt that instant  a young fellow came out from the place of examination with a pale countenance his lip quivering and his looks as wild as if he had seen a ghostHe no sooner appeared than we all flocked about him with the utmost eagerness to know what reception he had met with which after some pause he described recounting all the questions they had asked with the answers he made In this manner we obliged no less than twelve to recapitulate which now the danger was past they did with pleasure before it fell to my lot At length the beadle called my name with a voice that made me tremble as much as if it had been the last trumpet However there was no remedy I was conducted into a large hall where I saw about a dozen of grim faces sitting at a long table One of whom bid me come forward in such an imperious tone that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my sensesThe first question he put to me was  "Where was you born"  To which I answered In Scotland  "In Scotland said he I know that very wellwe have scarce any other countrymen to examine hereyou Scotchmen have overspread us of late as the locusts did EgyptI ask you in what part of Scotland was you born"  I named the place of my nativity which he had never before heard of He then proceeded to interrogate me about my age the town where I served my time with the term of my apprenticeship and when I had informed him that I served three years only he fell into a violent passion swore it was a shame and a scandal to send such raw boys into the world as surgeons that it was great presumption in me and an affront upon the English to pretend to  sufficient skill in my business having served so short a time when every apprentice in England was bound seven years at leastthat my friends had done better if they had made me a weaver or shoemaker but their pride would have me a gentleman he supposed at any rate and their poverty could not afford the necessary educationThis exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits but on the contrary reduced me to such a situation that I was scarce able to stand which being perceived by a plump gentleman who sat opposite to me with a skull before him he said Mr Snarler was too severe upon the young man and turning towards me told me I need not be afraid for no body would do me any harm then bidding me take time to recollect myself he examined me touching the operation of the trepan and was very well satisfied with my answersThe next person who questioned me was a wag who began by asking me if I had ever seen amputation performed to which I replying in the affirmative he shook his head and said  "What upon a dead subject I suppose If continued he during an engagement at sea a man should be brought to you with his head shot off how would you behave"  After some hesitation I owned such a case had never come under my observation neither did I remember to have seen any method of cure proposed for such an accident in any of the systems of surgery I had perused Whether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer or the archness of the question I know not but every member at the board deigned to smile except Mr Snarler who seemed to have very little of the  animal risibile  in his constitution  The facetious member encouraged by the success of his last joke went on thus  "Suppose you was called to a patient of a plethoric habit who had been bruised by a fall what would you do"  I answered I would bleed him immediately  "What said he before you tied up his arm"  But this stroke of wit not answering his expectation he desired me to advance to the gentleman who sat next him and who with a pert air asked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the intestinesI repeated the method of cure as it is prescribed by the best chirurgical writers which he heard to an end and then said with a supercilious smile  "So you think with such treatment the patient might recover"  I told him I saw nothing to make me think otherwise  "That may be resumed he I won't answer for your foresightbut did you ever know a case of this kind succeed"  I acknowledged I did not and was about to tell him I had never seen a wounded intestine but he stopt me by saying with some precipitation  "Nor never willI affirm that all wounds of the intestines whether great or small are mortal"  "Pardon me brother says the fat gentleman there is very good authority"  Here he was interrupted by the other with  "Sir excuse me I despise all authority  Nullius in verba  I stand upon my own bottom"  "But Sir Sir replied his antagonist the reason of the thing shews"  "A fig for reason cried this sufficient member I laugh at reason give me ocular demonstration"  The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm and observed that no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts would  advance such an extravagant assertionThis  inuendo  enraged the other so much that he started up and in a furious tone exclaimed  "What Sir do you question my knowledge in anatomy"  By this time all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or other of the disputants and raised their voices all together when the chairman commanded silence and ordered me to withdraw In less than a quarter of an hour I was called in again and received my qualification sealed up and was ordered to pay five shillingsI laid down my halfguinea upon the table and stood some time until one of them bid me begone to this I replied I will when I have got my change upon which another threw me five shillings and sixpence saying I would not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change I was afterwards obliged to give three shillings and sixpence to the beadles and a shilling to an old woman who swept the hall This disbursement sunk my finances to thirteen pence halfpenny with which I was sneaking off when Jackson perceiving it came up to me and begged I would tarry for him and he would accompany me to the other end of the town as soon as his examination should be over I could not refuse this to a person that was so much my friend but I was astonished at the change of his dress which was varied in half an hour from what I have already described to a very grotesque fashionHis head was covered with an old smoaked tyewig that did not boast one crooked hair and a sloutched hat over it which would have very well become a chimneysweeper or a dustmanhis neck was adorned with a black crape the ends of which he had twisted and  fixed in the buttonhole of a shabby great coat that wrapped up his whole body his white silk stockings were converted into black worsted hose and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles and a beard of his own paintingWhen I expressed my surprize at this metamorphosis he laughed and told me it was done by the advice and assistance of a friend who lived over the way and would certainly produce something very much to his advantage for it gave him the appearance of age which never fails of attracting respect I applauded his sagacity and waited with impatience for the effects of it At length he was called in but whether the odness of his appearance excited a curiosity more than usual in the board or his behaviour was not suitable to his figure I know not he was discovered to be an impostor and put into the hands of the beadle in order to be sent to Bridewell So that instead of seeing him come out with a chearful countenance and a surgeon's qualification in his hand I perceived him led through the outward hall as a prisoner and was very much alarmed and anxious to know the occasion when he called with a lamentable voice and piteous aspect to me and some others who knew him  "For God's sake gentlemen bear witness that I am the same individual John Jackson who served as surgeon's second mate on board the Elizabeth or else I shall go to Bridewell"  It would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever lived to have refrained from laughing at his appearance and address we therefore indulged ourselves a good while at his expence and afterwards pleaded his cause so effectually with the beadle who was  gratified with half a crown that the prisoner was dismissed and in a few moments resumed his former gaietyswearing since the board had refused his money he would spend it every shilling before he went to bed in treating his friends at the same time inviting us all to favour him with our companyIt was now ten o' clock at night and as I had a great way to walk in a town where I was a stranger I was prevailed upon to be of their party in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings which he faithfully promisedHe carried us to his friend's house who kept a tavern over the way where we remained drinking punch until the liquor mounted up to our heads and made us all extremely frolicksome I in particular was so much elevated that nothing would serve me but a wench at which Jackson expressed much joy and assured me I should have my desire before we partedAccordingly when he had paid the reckoning we sallied out roaring and singing and were conducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment where I immediately attached myself to a fair one with whom I proposed to spend the remaining part of the night but she not relishing my appearance refused to grant my request before I had made her an acknowledgment which not suiting my circumstances we broke off our correspondence to my no small mortification and resentment because I thought the mercenary creature had not done justice to my meritIn the mean time Mr Jackson's dress had attracted the inclinations and assiduities of two or three nymphs who loaded him with caresses in return for the arrack punch with which he treated them till at length notwithstanding  the sprightly sallies of these charmers sleep began to exert his power over us all and our conductor called  "To pay"  When the bill was brought which amounted to twelve shillings he put his hand in his pocket but might have saved himself the trouble for his purse was goneThis accident disconcerted him a good deal at first but after some recollection he seized the two Dulcineas who sat by him one in each hand and swore if they did not immediately restore his money he would charge a constable with themThe good lady at the bar seeing what passed whispered something to the drawer who went out and then with great composure asked what was the matterJackson told her he was robbed and if she refused him satisfaction he would have her and her whores committed to Bridewell  "Robbed cried she robbed in my house gentlemen and ladies I take you all to witness this person has scandalized my reputation"  At that instant seeing the constable and watch enter she went on  "What you must not only endeavour by your false aspersions to ruin my character but even commit an assault against my family Mr Constable I charge you with this uncivil person who has been guilty of a riot here I shall take care and bring an action against him for desamation"  While I was reflecting on this melancholy event which had made me quite sober the lady whose favours I had solicited being piqued at some repartee that passed between us cried  "They are all concerned"  and desired the constable to take us all into custody which was performed instantly to the utter astonishment and despair of us all except Jackson who  having been often in such scrapes was very little concerned and charged the constable in his turn with the landlady and her whole bevy Upon which we were carried all together prisoners to the roundhouse where Jackson after a word of comfort to us informed the constable of his being robbed to which he said he would swear next morning before the justice  "Ay ay says the bawd we shall see whose oath will most signify"  In a little time the constable calling Jackson into another room spoke to him thus  "I perceive that you and your company are strangers and am very sorry for your being involved in such an ugly business as this is I have known this woman a great while she has kept a notorious house in the neighbourhood these many years and although often complained of as a nuisance still escapes thro' her interest with the Jtces to whom she and all of her employment pay contribution quarterly for protectionAs she charged me with you first her complaint will have the preference and she can procure evidence to swear whatever she shall please to desire them So that unless you make it up before morning you and your companions may think yourselves happily quit for a month's hard labour in BridewellNay if she should swear a robbery or assault against you you will be committed to Newgate and tried next sessions at the OldBaily for your life"  This last piece of information had such an effect upon Jackson that he agreed to make it up provided his money might be restored The constable told him that instead of restoring what they had stol'n he was pretty certain it would cost him some more before  they would come to any compositionBut however he had compassion on him and would if he pleased sound them about a mutual releaseThe unfortunate beau thanked him for his friendship and returned to us where he acquainted us with the substance of this dialogue while the constable desiring to speak in private with our adversary carried her into the next room and pleaded our cause so effectually that she condescended to make him umpire He accordingly proposed an arbitration to which we gave our assent and he fined each party in three shillings to be laid out in a bowl or punch wherein we drowned all animosities to the inexpressible joy of my two late acquaintances and me who had been in the state of the damned ever since Jackson mentioned Bridewell and NewgateBy the time we had finished our bowl to which by the by I had contributed my last shilling it was morning and I proposed to move homeward when the constable gave me to understand he could discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice before whom we must appearThis renewed my regret and I coursed the hour in which I had yielded to Jackson's invitationAbout nine aclock we were escorted to the house of a certain justice not many miles distant from CoventGarden who no sooner saw the constable enter with a train of prisoners at his heels than he saluted him as follows  "So Mr Constable you are a diligent manwhat den of rogues have you been scouring"  Then looking at us who appeared with a dejected air he continued  "Ay ay thieves I seeold offendersO your humble servant Mrs Harridan I suppose these fellows have been taken robbing your houseyes yes here's an old  acquaintance of mineyou have used expedition said he to me in returning from transportation but we shall save you that trouble for the futurethe surgeons will fetch you from your next transportation at their expence"  I assured his worship he was mistaken in me for he had never seen me in his life beforeTo this he replied  "How you impudent rascal dare you say so to my face Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent which you have assumed but it shan't avail youyou shall find me too far north for youHere clerk write this fellow's  mittimus  His name is Patrick Gaghagan"  Here Mr Jackson interposed and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town descended of a good family and that my name was RandomThe justice looked upon this declaration as an outrage against his memory on which he valued himself much and strutting up to Jackson with a fierce countenance put his hands in his sides and said  "Who are you SirDo you give me the lieTake notice gentlemen here's a fellow who affronts me upon the benchbut I'll lay you fast sirrah I willfor notwithstanding your laced jacket I believe you are a notorious felon"  My friend was so much abashed at this menace which was thundered out with great vociferation that he changed colour and remained speechlessThis his worship took for a symptom of guilt and to compleat the discovery continued his threats  "Now I am convinced you are a thiefyour face discovers ityou tremble all overyour conscience won't lie stillyou will be hang'd  sirrah raising his voice you will be hanged and happy had it been for the world as well as your own miserable soul if you had been detected and cut off in the beginning of your careerCome hither clerk and take this man's confession"  I was in an agony of consternation when the constable going into another room with his worship acquainted him with the truth of the story upon which he returned with a smiling countenance and addressing himself to us all said it was always his way to terrify young people when they came before him that his threats might make a strong impression on their minds and deterr them from engaging in scenes of riot and debauchery which commonly ended before the judgeThus having cloaked his own want of discernment under the disguise of paternal care we were dismissed and I found myself as much lightened as if a mountain had been lifted from off my breast  CHAP XVIII  I carry my qualifications to the navyofficethe nature of itthe behaviour of the styStrap's concern for my absencea battle betwixt him and a blacksmiththe troublesome consequences of ithis harrangue to mehis friend the schoolmaster recommends me to a French apothecary who entertains me as a journeyman  I Would willingly have gone home to sleep but was told by my companions that we must deliver our letters of qualification at the navyoffice before one aclock upon which we repaired thither and gave them to the sty who opened and read them and I was mightily pleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third rate When he had stuck them all together on a file one of our company asked if there were any vacancies to which he answered No Then I ventured to enquire if any ships were to be put in commission soonAt which he surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt and pushing us out of his office locked the door without deigning us one wordWe went down stairs and conferred together on our expectations when I understood that each of them had been recommended to one or other of the commissioners and each of them promised the first vacancy that  should fall but that none of them relied solely upon that interest without a present to the sty with whom the cmmrs went snacksFor which reason each had provided a small purse and I was asked what I proposed to giveThis was a vexatious question to me who so far from being in a capacity to gratify a ravenous sty had not wherewithal to buy me a dinnerI therefore answered I had not determined yet what to give and sneaked off towards my own lodging cursing my fate all the way and inveighing with much bitterness against the barbarity of my grandfather and the sordid avarice of my relations who left me a prey to contempt and indigenceFull of these disagreeable reflections I arrived at the house where I lodged and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account for this honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident and that he should never see me againStrap who had been to see me in the morning understanding I had been abroad all night was almost distracted and after having obtained leave of his master had gone in quest of me though he was even more ignorant of the town than I Not being willing to inform my landlord of my adventure I told him I had met an acquaintance at Surgeon'shall with whom I spent the evening and night but being very much infested by bugs I had not slept much and therefore intended to take a little repose so saying I went to bed and desired to be awakened if Strap happened to come while I should be asleepI was accordingly roused by my friend himself who entered my chamber about three aclock in the afternoon and presented a figure to my eyes that I could  scarce believe realIn short this affectionate shaver setting out towards Surgeon'shall had enquired for me there to no purpose from thence he found his way to the navyoffice where he he could hear no tidings of me because I was unknown to every body then present he afterwards went upon Change in hopes of seeing me upon the Scotch walk but without any success At last being almost in dispair of finding me he resolved to ask every body he met in the street if perchance any one could give him information about me and actually put his resolution in practice in spite of the scoffs curses and reproaches with which he was answered until a blacksmith's 'prentice seeing him stop a porter with a burden on his back and hearing his question for which he received a hearty curse called to him and asked if the person he enquired after was not a ScotchmanStrap replied with great eagerness  "Yes and had on a brown coat with long skirts"  "The same said the blacksmith I saw him pass about an hour ago"  "Did you so cried Strap rubbing his hands Odd I am very glad of thatwhich way went he"  "Towards Tyburn in a cart said he if you make good speed you may get thither time enough to see him hanged"  This piece of wit incensed my friend to such a degree that he called the blacksmith scoundrel and protested he would fight him for half a farthing  "No no said the other stripping I'll have none of your moneyyou Scotchmen seldom carry any about youbut I'll fight you for love"  There was a ring immediately formed by the mob and Strap finding he could not get off honourably without fighting  at the same time burning with resentment against his adversary quitted his cloaths to the care of the multitude and the battle began with great violence on the side of Strap who in a few minutes exhausted his breach and spirits on his patient antagonist who sustained the assault with great coolness till finding the barber quite spent he returned the blows he had lent him with such interest that Strap after having received three falls on the hard stones gave out and allowed the blacksmith to be the better manThe victory being thus decided it was proposed to adjourn to a cellar hard by and drink friendsBut when my friend began to gather up his cloaths he perceived that some honest person or other had made free with his shirt neckcloath hat and wig which were carried off and probably his coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate had they been worth the stealingIt was in vain for him to make a noise which only yielded mirth to the spectators he was fain to get off in this manner which he accomplished with much difficulty and appeared before me all besmeared with blood and dirtNotwithstanding this misfortune such was his transport at finding me safe and sound that he had almost stifled and stunk me to death with his embracesAfter he had cleaned himself and put on one of my shirts and a woolen nightcape instead of hat and wig I recounted to him the particulars of my night's campaign which filled him with admiration and made him repeat with great energy an observation which was often in his mouth  viz  "London is the devil's drawing room"  As neither of us had dined he desired me to get up and the milkwoman coming round at that instant  he went down stairs and brought up a quart with a penny brick on which we made a comfortable meal He then shared his money with me which amounted to eighteenpence and left me with an intention to borrow an old wig and hat of his friend the schoolmaster  He was no sooner gone than I began to consider my situation with great uneasiness and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest in order to chuse and pursue some one that would procure me bread for it is impossible to express the pangs I felt when I reflected on the miserable dependance in which I lived at the expence of a poor barber's boyMy pride took the alarm and having no hopes of succeeding at the navyoffice I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot guards next day  coute qui coute  This extravagant design by flattering my disposition gave great satisfaction and I was charging the enemy at the head of my own regiment when Strap's return interrupted my reverieThe schoolmaster had made him a present of the tyewig which he wore when I was introduced to him together with an old hat whose brims would have overshadowed a ColossusThough Strap had ventured to wear them in the dusk he did not chuse to entertain the mob by day therefore went to work immediately and reduced them both to a moderate size While he was employed in this manner he addressed me thus  "To be sure Mr Random you are born a gentleman and have a great deal of learningand indeed look like a gentleman for as to person you may hold up your head with the best of themOn the other hand I am a poor but honest cobler's sonmy mother was as industrious  a woman as ever broke bread 'till such time as she took to drinking which you very well knowbut every body has failings  humanum est errare  Now for myself I am a poor journeyman barber tolerably well made and understand some Latin and have a smattering of Greekbut what of that perhaps I might also say that I know a little of the worldbut that is not to the purposethough you be gentle and I simple it does not follow but that I who am simple may do a good office to you who are gentleNow this is the casemy kinsman the schoolmasterperhaps you did not know how nearly he is related to meI'll satisfy you in that presentlyhis mother and my grandfather's sister's nephewno that's not itmy grandfather's brother's daughterrabbit it I have forgot the degreebut this I know he and I are cousins seven times removed"  My impatience to know the good office he had done me got the better of my temper and I interrupted him at this place with  "Dn your relation and pedigreeif the schoolmaster or you can be of any advantage to me why don't you tell it without all this preamble"  When I pronounced these words with some vehemence Strap looked at me for some time with a grave countenance and then went on  "Surely our pedigree is not to be dn'd because it is not so noble as yoursI am very sorry to see such an alteration in your temper of lateyou was always fiery but now you are grown as crabbed as old Periwinkle the drunken tinker on whom you and I God forgive us plaid so many unlucky tricks while we were at  schoolbut I will no longer detain you in suspence because doubtless nothing is more uneasy than doubt  dubio procul dubio nil dubius  My friend or relation or which you will or both the schoolmaster being informed of the regard I have for youfor you may be sure I did not fail to let him know your good qualitiesby the by he has undertaken to teach you the pronounciation of the Englishtongue without which he says you will be unfit for business in this countryI say my relation has spoke in your behalf to a French apothecary who wants a journeyman and on his recommendation you may have fifteen pounds  per  year bed and board whenever you please"  I was too much interested in this piece of news to entertain it with indifference but jumping up I insisted on Strap's accompanying me immediately to the house of his friend that I might not lose this opportunity through the least delay or neglect on my partWe were informed that the schoolmaster was in company at a public house in the neighbourhood whither we repaired and found him drinking with the very individual apothecary in question When he was called to the door at our desire and observed my impatience he broke out in his usual term of admiration  "O Chst I suppose when you heard of this offer you did not take leisure enough to come down stairs but leapt out of the window did you overturn no porter nor oysterwoman in your wayIt was a mercy of God you did not knock your brains out against some post in your careerO' my conscience I believe had I been in the inmost recesses of my habitationthe very  penetralia  even in  bed with my wife your eagerness would have surmounted bolts bars decency and every thingThe den of Cacus or  Sancti sanctorum  could not have hid me from you But come along the gentleman of whom I spoke is in the house I will present you to him forthwith"  When I entered the room I perceived four or five people smoaking one of whom the schoolmaster accosted thus  "Mr Lavement here is the young man of whom I spoke to you"  The apothecary who was a little old withered man with a forehead about an inch high a nose turned up at the end large check bones that helped to form a pit for his little grey eyes a great bag of loose skin hanging down on each side in wrinkles like the alforjas of a baboon and a mouth so accustomed to that contraction which produces grinning that he could not pronounce a syllable without discovering the remains of his teeth which consisted of four yellow fangs not improperly by anatomists called  canine  This person I say after having eyed me sometime said  "Oho 'tis ver well Mons Concordanceyong man you are ver welcome take one coup of bierreand come to mine house tomarrow morning Mons Concordance vil shew you de way"  Upon this I made my bow and as I went out of the room could hear him say  Ma foy ce'st un beau garçon ce'st un galliard  As I had by my own application while I served Crab acquired the French tongue well enough to read authors written in that language and understand any thing that occurred in conversation I determined to pretend ignorance to my new master that he and his family whom I supposed to be of the same country  not being on the reserve before me might possibly discover something in discourse which would either yield me amusement or advantageNext morning Mr Concordance carried me to the apothecary's house where the bargain was made and orders given to provide an apartment for me immediatelyBut before I entered upon business the schoolmaster recommended me to his taylor who gave me credit for a suit of cloaths to be paid out of the first moiety of my wages and they were begun that very day he afterwards accommodated me with a new hat on the same terms so that in a few days I hoped to make a very fashionable appearanceIn the mean time Strap conveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me which was a back room up two pair of stairs furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon a chair without a back an earthen chamberpot without a handle a bottle by way of candlestick and a triangular piece of glass instead of a mirrour the rest of its ornaments having been lately removed to one of the garrets for the convenience of the servant of an Irish captain who lodged in the first floor  CHAP XIX  The characters of Mr Lavement his wife and daughtersome anecdotes of the familythe mother and daughter rivalsI am guilty of a mistake that gives me present satisfaction but is attended with troublesome consequences  NEXT day while I was at work in the shop a bouncing damsel well dressed came in on pretence of finding a vial for some use or other and taking an opportunity when she thought I did not mind her of observing me narrowly went away with a silent look of disdainI easily guessed her sentiments and my pride took the resolution of entertaining the same indifference and neglect towards herAt dinner the maids with whom I dined in the kitchen gave me to understand that this was my master's only daughter who would have a very handsome fortune on account of which and her beauty a great many young gentlemen made their addresses to herthat she had been twice on the brink of marriage but disappointed by the stinginess of her father who refused to part with a shilling as long as he should livefor which reason the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial veneration that might be expected In particular she harbour'd the most perfect hatred for his countrymen in which disposition her mother join'd who was an English woman and by the hints  they dropp'd I learn'd the grey mare was the better horsethat she was a matron of a high spirit which was often manifested at the expence of her dependants That she lov'd diversions and look'd upon miss as her rival in all parties which was indeed the true cause of her disappointments for had the mother been hearty in her interest the father would not have ventur'd to refuse her demandsOver and above this intelligence I of myself soon made more discoveries Mr Lavement's significant grins at his wife while she look'd another way convinc'd me that he was not at all content with his lot And his behaviour in presence of the captain made me believe his chief torment was jealousyAs for my own part I was consider'd in no other light than that of a menial servant and had been already six days in the house without being honour'd with one word from either mother or daughter the latter as I understood from the maids having at table one day expressed some surprize that her papa should entertain such an aukward meanlooking journeymanI was nettled at this piece of information and next sunday it being my turn to take my diversion dressed myself in my new cloaths to the greatest advantage and vanity apart made no contemptible figureAfter having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some of his acquaintance I came home in the afternoon and was let in by miss who not knowing me dropt a low courtesy as I advanced which I returned with a profound bow and shut the doorBy that time I had turn'd about she had perceiv'd her mistake and chang'd colour but did not withdraw The passage being narrow I could not get away without  jostling her so I was forc'd to remain where I was with my eyes fix'd on the ground and my face glowing with blushesAt length her vanity coming to her assistance she went away tittering and I could hear her pronounce the word  "creature"  From this day forward she came into the shop fifty times every day upon various pretences and put in practice so many ridiculous airs that I could easily perceive her opinion of me was chang'd and that she did not think me altogether an unworthy conquestBut my heart was so steel'd against her charms by pride and resentment which were two chief ingredients in my disposition that I remain'd insensible to all her arts and notwithstanding some advances she made could not be prevail'd upon to yield her the least attentionThis neglect soon banish'd all the favourable impressions she felt for me and the rage of a slighted woman took place in her heart which she manifested not only in all the suggestions her malice could invent to my prejudice with her father but also in procuring for me such servile employments as she hoped would sufficiently humble my spirit One day in particular she order'd me to brush my master's coat but I refusing a smart dialogue ensued which ended in her bursting into tears of rage when her mother interposing and examining into the merits of the cause determin'd it in my favour and this good office I ow'd not to any esteem or consideration she had for me but solely to the desire or mortifying her daughter who on this occasion observ'd that let people be never so much in the right there were some folks who would never do them justice but to be sure they had their reason for it which some people were not  ignorant of although they despised their little artsThis insinuation of some people and some folks put me upon observing the behavuiour of my mistress more narrowly for the future and it was not long before I had reason to believe that she look'd upon her daughter as a rival in the affections of captain Odonnell who lodged in the houseIn the mean time my industry and knowledge gain'd me the good will of my master who would often say in French  "  Mardy c'est un bon Garçon  "  He had a great deal of business but as he was mostly employ'd among his fellow refugees his profits were smallHowever his expence for medicines was not great he being the most expert man at a succedaneum of any apothecary in London so that I have been sometimes amaz'd to see him without the least hesitation make up a physician's prescription though he had not in his shop one medicine mention'd in itOystershells he could convert into crab's eyes common oil into oil of sweet almonds syrup of sugar into balsamic syrup Thames water into aqua cinnamomi turpentine into capivi and a hundred more costly preparations were produc'd in an instant from the cheapest and coursest drugs of the  materia medica  And when any common thing was order'd for a patient he always took care to disguise it in colour or taste or both in such a manner as that it could not possibly be knownFor which purpose cochineal and oil of cloves were of great service among many nostrums which he possess'd there was one for the venereal disease that brought him a good deal of money and this he conceal'd so artfully from me that I could never learn its composition But during the eight months I stay'd  in his service he was so unfortunate in the use of it that three parts in four of those who took it were fain to confirm the cure with a salivation under the direction of another doctorThis bad success in all appearance attach'd him the more to his specifick and before I left him I may venture to say he would have sooner renounc'd the Trinity notwithstanding his being a good Huegonot than his confidence in the neversailing power of this remedyMr Lavement had attempted more than once to introduce a vegetable diet into his family by launching out into the praise of it and decrying the use of flesh both as a Physician and Philosopher but all his rhetoric could not make one proselyte to his opinion and even the wife of his bosom declared against the proposalWhether it was owing to the little regard she paid to her husband's admonition in this particular or to the natural warmth of her constitution I know not but this lady's passions became every day more and more violent till at last she look'd upon decency as an unnecessary restraint and one afternoon when her husband was abroad and her daughter visiting order'd me to call a hackney coach in which she and the captain drove off towards CoventGardenMiss came home in the evening and supping at her usual hour went to bedAbout eleven a clock my master enter'd and ask'd if his wife was gone to sleep Upon which I told him my mistress went out in the afternoon and was not yet return'dThis was like a clap of thunder to the poor Apothecary who starting back cried  "  Mort de ma vie  vat you tell a meMy wife not at home"  At that instant a patient's servant arriv'd with a prescription for a draught  which my master taking went into the shop to make it up himselfWhile he rubb'd the ingredients in a glass mortar he enquir'd of me whether or no his wife went out alone and no sooner heard that she was in company with the captain than with one blow he split the mortar into a thousand pieces and grinning like the head of a bass viol exclaim'd  "Ah traitresse"  It would have been impossible for me to have preserv'd my gravity a minute longer when I was happily reliev'd by a rap at the door which I open'd and perceiv'd my mistress coming out of a coach she flounc'd immediately into the shop and addressed her husband thus  "I suppose you thought I was lost my dearCaptain Odonnell has been so good as to treat me with a play"  "Playplay replied he Oho yes by gar I believe ver prettie play"  "Bless me said she what's the matter"  "Vat de matter cried he forgetting all his former complaisance by gar you be one damn dog's wifeventre bleu me vill show you vat it is to put one horn upon mine head Pardieu le capitaine Odonnell be one"  Here the captain who had been all the while at the door discharging the coach entering said with a terrible voice  "Dmme what am I"  Mr Lavement changing his tone immediately saluted him with  "  Oh serviteur monsieur le capitaine vous etes un galant hommema femme est fort obligée  "  Then turning about towards me pronounc'd with a low voice  "  Et diablement obligeante sans doute  "  "Harkee Mr Lavement said the captain I am a man of honour and I believe you are too much of a gentleman to be offended at the civility I shew your  wife"  This declaration had such an effect on the apothecary that he resum'd all the politesse of a Frenchman and with the utmost prostration of compliment assur'd the captain that he was perfectly satisfied with the honour he had done his wifeMatters being thus compos'd every body went to restNext day I perceiv'd thro' a glass door that open'd from the shop into a parlour the captain talking earnestly to miss who heard him with a look that expressed anger mingled with scorn which however he at last found means to mollify and seal'd his reconciliation with a kissThis soon convinc'd me of the occasion of the quarrel but notwithstanding all my vigilance I could never discover any other commerce between themIn the mean while I had reason to believe I had inspir'd one of the maids with tender sentiments for me and one night when I thought every other person in the house asleep I took the opportunity of the other maid's absence for she had got leave to go and visit her sick father who liv'd at Richmond to avail myself of my conquest Accordingly I got up and naked as I was explor'd my way in the dark to the garret where she layI was ravish'd to find the door open and moved softly to her bedside transported with the hope of compleating my wishesBut what horrors of jealousy and disappointment did I feel when I found her asleep fast locked in the arms of a man whom I easily guessed to be no other than the captain's servant I was upon the point of doing some rash thing when the noise of a rat scratching behind the wainscoat put me to flight and I was fain to get back to my own bed in safetyWhether this alarm had disorder'd my mind  or that I was led astray by the power of destiny I know not but instead of turning to the left when I descended to the second story I persu'd the contrary course and mistook the young lady's bedchamber for my own I did not perceive my mistake before I had run against the bed posts and then it was not in my power to retreat undiscover'd for the nymph being awake felt my approach and with a soft voice bid me make less noise lest the Scotchbooby in the next room should overhear us This hint was sufficient to inform me of the nature of the assignation and as my passions at any time high were then in a state of exaltation I was resolved to profit by my good fortuneWithout any more ceremony therefore I made bold to slip into bed to this charmer who gave me as favourable a reception as I could desireOur conversation was very sparing on my part but she upbraided the person whom I represented with his jealousy of me whom she handled so roughly that my resentment had well nigh occasion'd a discovery more than once but I was consoled for her hatred of me by understanding from her own mouth that it was now high time to salve her reputation by matrimony for she had reason to fear she could not much longer conceal the effects of their mutual intercourseWhile I was meditating an answer to this proposal I heard a noise in my room like something heavy falling down upon the floor Upon which I started up and creeping to the door of my chamber observ'd by moonlight the shadow of a man groping his way out whereupon I retir'd to one side to let him pass and saw him go down stairs as expeditiously as he couldIt was an easy matter to divine that this  was the captain who having overslept himself had got up at last to keep his assignation and finding my door open had enter'd into my apartment instead of that of his mistress where I supplied his placeBut finding his mistake by falling over my chair was afraid the noise might alarm the family and for that reason made off delaying the gratification of his desire till another opportunityBy this time I was satisfied and instead of returning to the place from whence I came retreated to my own castle which I fortified by bolting the door and in the congratulation of my own happiness fell asleepBut the truth of this adventure could not be long conceal'd from my young mistress who next day came to an eclaircisement with the captain upon his lamenting his last night's disappointment and begging pardon for the noise he had madeTheir mutual chagrin when they came to the knowledge of what had happen'd may be easily conjectur'd though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other for she was conscious of having not only betray'd to me the secrets of her commerce with him but also of having incensed me by the freedoms she had taken with my name beyond a hope of reconciliationOn the other hand his jealousy suggested that her sorrow was all artifice and that I had supplied his place with her own privity and consentThat such was the situation of their thoughts will appear in the sequelfor that very day she came into the shop where I was alone and fixing her eyes swimming in tears upon me sigh'd most piteously But I was proof against her distress by recollecting the epithets with which she had honour'd me the night before and believing that the good reception I enjoy'd  was destin'd for another I therefore took no notice of her affliction and she had the mortification to find her disdain return'd fourfoldHowever from thenceforward she thought proper to use me with more complaisance than usual knowing that it was in my power at any time to publish her shameBy these means my life became much more agreeable though I never could prevail upon myself to repeat my nocturnal visit and as I every day improv'd in my knowledge of the town I shook off my aukward air by degrees and acquir'd the character of a polite journeyman apothecary  CHAP XX  I am assaulted and dangerously woundedI suspect Odonnell and am confirmed in my opinionI concert a scheme of revenge and put it in executionOdonnell robs his own servant and dissappearsI make my addresses to a lady and am miraculously deliver'd from her snare  ONE night about twelve a clock as I return'd from visiting a patient at Chelsea I receiv'd a blow on my head from an unseen hand that stretch'd me senseless on the ground and was left for dead with three stabs of a sword in my bodyThe groans I utter'd when I recover'd the use of my reason alarm'd the people of a solitary alehouse that stood near the spot where I lay and they were humane enough to take me  in and send for a surgeon who dressed my wounds and assur'd me they were not mortal One of them penetrated through the skin and muscles of one side of my belly in such a manner that doubtless the assassin imagin'd he had run me through the entrailsThe second slanted along one of my ribs and the last which was intended for the  Coup de Grace  being directed to my heart the sword snapt upon my breast bone and the point remain'd sticking in the skinWhen I reflected upon this event I could not persuade myself that I had been assaulted by a common footpad because it is not usual for such people to murder those they rob especially when they meet with no resistance and I found my money and every thing else about me but my carcase safe I concluded therefore that I must either have been mistaken for another or oblig'd to the private resentment of some secret enemy for what had happened and as I could remember nobody who had the least cause of complaint against me except captain Odonnell and my master's daughter my suspicion settled upon them though I took care to conceal it that I might the sooner arrive at confirmationWith this view I went home in a chair about ten a clock in the morning and as the chairmen supported me into the house met the captain in the passage who no sooner saw me than he started back and gave evident signs of guilty confusion which he would have accounted for from the surprize occasion'd by seeing me in such a conditionMy master having heard my story condoled me with a good deal of sympathy and when he understood my wounds were not dangerous order'd me to be carried up stairs to bed though not without some  opposition from his wife who was of opinion it would be better for me to go to an hospital where I should be more carefully attendedMy meditation was employ'd in concerting with myself some method of revenge against 'Squire Odonnell and his enamorata whom I looked upon as the authors of my misfortune when miss who was not at home at my arrival entered my chamber and saying she was sorry for the accident that had befallen me asked me if I suspected any body to be the assassin Upon which I fixed my eyes stedfastly upon her and answer'd  "Yes"  She discover'd no symptom of confusion but replied hastily  "If that be the case why don't you take out a warrant to have him apprehendedIt will cost but a trifleif you have no money I'll lend you"  This frankness not only cur'd me of my suspicion with respect to her but even stagger'd my belief in regard to the captain of whose guilt I resolv'd to have farther proofs before I enterpriz'd any thing in the way of revengeI thanked her kindly for her generous offer which however I had no occasion to accept being determin'd to do nothing rashly For though I could plainly perceive the person who attacked me to be a soldier whose face I thought was familiar to me I could not swear with a safe conscience to any particular man and granting I could my prosecution of him would not much availThis I pretended lest the captain hearing from her that I knew the person who wounded me might think proper to withdraw before I could be in a condition to requite himIn two days I was up and able to do a little business so that Mr Lavement made shift to carry on his practice without hiring another  journeyman in my roomThe first thing I attempted towards a certain discovery of my secret enemy was to get into Odonnell's apartment while he was abroad in an undress and examine his sword the point of which being broke off I applied the fragment that was found sticking in my body and found it answer'd the fractur'd part exactlyThere was now no room left for doubt and all that remain'd was to fix upon a scheme of revenge which almost solely engrossed my thoughts during the space of eight nights and daysSometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the same manner as he had practised upon me and kill him outrightBut this my honour oppos'd as a piece of barbarous cowardice in which he was not to be imitatedAt other times I entertain'd thoughts of demanding satisfaction in an honourable way but was diverted from this undertaking by considering the uncertainty of the event and the nature of the injury he had done me which did not intitle him to such easy termsAt last I determin'd to pursue a middle course and actually put my design in execution after this mannerHaving secured the assistance of Strap and two of his acquaintance whom he could depend upon we provided ourselves in disguises and I caused the following letter to be deliver'd to him by one of our associates in livery one Sunday evening  SIR  IF I may be allowed to judge from appearance it will not be disagreeable to you to hear that my husband is sent for to Bagshot to visit a patient and will not return till tomorrow  night so that if you have any thing to propose to me as your behaviour on many occasions has seemed to insinuate you will do well to embrace the present opportunity of seeing  Yours c  This letter was signed with the name of an apothecary's wife who lived in Chelsea of whom I had heard Odonnell was an admirerEvery thing succeeded to our wishThe amorous hero hastened towards the place of assignanation and was encountered by us in the very place where he had assaulted meWe rushed upon him all at once secured his sword stript off his cloaths even to the skin which we scourged with nettles till he was blistered from head to foot notwithstanding all the eloquence of his tears and supplications When I was satisfied with the stripes I had bestowed we carried off his cloaths which we hid in a hedge near the place and left him stark naked to find his way home in the best manner he could while I took care to be there before himI afterwards understood that in his way to the lodgings of a friend who lived in the skirts of the town he was picked up by the watch who carried him to the Roundhouse from whence he sent for cloaths to his lodgings and next morning arrived at the door in a chair wrapt up in a blanket he had borrowed for his body was so sore and swelled that he could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparelHe was treated with the utmost tenderness by my mistress and her daughter  who vied one with the other in their care and attendance of him but Lavement himself could not forbear expressing his joy by several malicious grins while he ordered me to prepare an unguent to anoint him withAs to myself no body can doubt my gratification when I had every day an opportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adversary by the sores and ulcers I had been the cause of and indeed I not only enjoyed the satisfaction of having flead him alive but another also which I had not foreseenThe story of his being attacked and stript in such a place having been inserted in the news gave information to those who found his cloaths next day whither to bring them and accordingly he retrieved every thing he had lost except a few letters among which was that which I had wrote to him in the name of the apothecary's wifeThis and the others which it seems were all on the subject of love for this Hibernian hero was one of those people who are called fortunehunters fell into the hands of a certain female author famous for the scandal she has published who after having embellished them with some ornaments of her own invention gave them to the town in printI was very much shocked on reflecting that I might possibly be the occasion of a whole family's unhappiness on account of the letter I had written but was eased of that apprehension when I understood that the Chelsea apothecary had commenced a lawsuit against the printer for defamation and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery committed by the author who had disappearedBut whatever might be his opinion of the matter our two ladies seemed to entertain a  different idea of it for as soon as the pamphlet appeared I could perceive their care of their patient considerably diminish until at last it ended in total neglectIt was impossible for him to be ignorant of this change any more than of the occasion of it but as he was conscious to himself of having deserved worse than contempt at their hands he was glad to come off so cheaply and contented himself with muttering curses and threats against the apothecary who as he imagined having got an inkling of the appointment with his wife had taken revenge of him in the manner describedBy that time he had got a new scarf skin his character was become so notorious that he thought it high time for him to decamp which he performed one night without beat of drum after having robbed his own servant of every thing that belonged to him except the cloaths he had on his backA few days after he disappeared Mr Lavement for his own security took into custody a large old trunk which he had left and as it was very heavy made no question of the contents being sufficient to indemnify him for what Odonnel owed in lodgingBut a month being elapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer and my master being impatient to know what the trunk contained he ordered me to break it open in his presence which I performed with the pestle of our great mortar and discovered to his inexpressible astonishment and mortification a heap of stones  About this time my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of  valet de chambre  and at the same time assured me that whatever advantage he  might propose to himself from this prospect he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me so much was he attached to my fortuneIn spite of all the obligations I owed this poor honest fellow ingratitude is so natural to the heart of man that I began to be tired of his acquaintance and now that I had contracted other friendships which appeared more creditable I was even ashamed to see a journey man barber enquiring after me with the familiarity of a companionI therefore on pretence of consulting his welfare insisted upon his accepting the proposal which he at last determined to embrace with great reluctance and in a few days took his leave of me shedding a flood of tears which I could not behold without emotionI now began to look upon myself as a gentleman in reality learned to dance of a Frenchman whom I had cured of a fashionable distemper frequented plays during the holidays became the oracle of an alehouse where every dispute was referred to my decision and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady who found means to make a conquest of my heart and upon whom I prevailed after much attendance and solicitation to give me a promise of marriageAs this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress I blessed my good fortune and was actually on the point of crowning all my wishes by matrimony when one morning I went to her lodgings and her maid being abroad took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter her chamber where to my utter confusion I found her in bed with a manHeaven gave me patience and presence of mind enough to withdraw immediately and I thanked my stars a thousand times for the happy  discovery by which I resolved to profit so much as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future  CHAP XXI  'Squire Gawky comes to lodge with my masteris involved in a troublesome affair out of which he is extricated by mehe marries my master's daughterthey conspire against meI am found guilty of theftdischargeddeserted by my friendsI hire a room in St Giles'swhere by accident I find the lady to whom I made my addresses in a miserable conditionI relieve her  WHILE I enjoyed myself at large in this temper of mind Mr Lavement let his first floor to my countryman and acquaintance 'Squire Gawky who by this time had got a lieutenancy in the army and such a martial ferocity in his appearance that I was afraid he would remember what had happened between us in Scotland and atone for his breach of appointment then by his punctuality now but whether he had actually forgot me or was willing to make me believe so he betrayed not the least symptom of recognition at sight of me and I remained quite cured of my apprehension though I had occasion not long after to be convinced that howsoever his externals might be altered he was at  bottom the same individual Gawky whom I have already describedFor coming home late one night from the house of a patient I heard a noise in the street and as I approached perceived two gentlemen in custody of three watchmen The prisoners who seemed to be miserably disfigured with dirt complained bitterly of the loss of their hats and wigs and one of them whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman lamented most piteously offering a guinea for his liberty which the watchman refused alledging that one of his companions was wounded grievously and that he must stand to the consequenceMy prejudice in favour of my native country was so strong that I could not bear to see any body belonging to it in distress and therefore with one blow of my faithful cudgel knocked down the watchman who had hold of the person for whom I was chiefly concernedHe no sooner sound himself disengaged than he betook himself to his heels and left me to maintain the dispute as I should think proper and indeed I came off but scurvily for before I could avail myself of my speed I received a blow on the eye from one of the other two that had well nigh deprived me of the use of that organ however I made shift to get home where I was informed of captain Gawky's being robb'd and abused by a company of footpads and was ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster and paregorick draught in order to allay and compose the ferment of his spirits occasioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediatelyWhen I enquired into the particulars of this adventure and understood by the servant that he came in just before  me without hat and wig I made no scruple of believing him to be the person I had released and was confirmed in that belief upon hearing his voice to which before that event I had been so long a stranger My eye being considerably swelled and inflamed I could not reflect upon my enterprise without cursing my own folly and even resolving to declare the truth of the whole story in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch for whom I had suffered Accordingly next day after he had told in presence of my master his wife and daughter who came to visit him a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shewn in making his escape I ventured to explain the mystery and calling in the evidence of my contused eye upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitudeGawky was so astonished at this discourse that he could not answer one word and the rest of the company stared at one another till at length my mistress repremanded me for my insolent behaviour and threatened to turn me away for my presumptionUpon which Gawky having recollected himself observed as the young man might have mistaken another person for him he could forgive his insinuations more especially as he seemed to have suffered for his civility but advised me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future before I ventured to publish them to the prejudice of any manMiss applauded the captain's generosity in pardoning one who had so villainously aspersed him and I began to imagine her praise was not at all disinterestedBut the apothecary who perhaps had more penetration or less partiality than his wife and daughter differed from them in his sentiments of the matter and expressed  himself to me in the shop in this manner  "Ah mon pauvre Roderique you ave more of de veracite dan of de prudencebot mine vife and dater be diablement sage and Mons le capitaine un fanfaron pardieu"  This elogium on his wife and daughter though meant ironically by him was nevertheless literally just for by espousing the cause of Gawky the one obliged a valuable lodger and the other acquired a husband at a juncture when one was absolutely necessary for the young lady finding the effects of her correspondence with Odonnel becoming plainer and plainer every day insinuated herself so artfully into the affection of this new lodger that in less than a fortnight on pretence of going to a play they drove away together to the Fleet where they were coupled from thence removed to a bagnio where the marriage was consummated and in the morning came home where they asked her father's and mother's blessingThe prudent parents notwithstanding the precipitation with which it was carried on did not think fit to refuse their approbation for the apothecary was not ill pleased to find his daughter married to a young man of a good prospect who had not mentioned to him one syllable on the article of her dowry and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival in her gallants and a spy upon her pleasuresNor was I without selfenjoyment at this event when I reflected upon the revenge I had unwittingly taken upon my enemy in making him a cuckold by anticipationBut I little dream'd what a storm of mischief was brewing against me whilst I thus indulged myselfWhatever face Gawkey put on the matter my discovery of the adventure before related  and the reproaches I vented against him had stung him to the soul and cherished the seeds of emnity so strongly in his breast that he it seems imparted his indignation to his wife who being as desirous as he to compass the ruin of one that not only slighted her caresses but was able on any occasion to discover particulars not at all advantageous to her character readily joined in a conspiracy against me which had it taken effect as they expected would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death  My master having several times missed large quantities of medicines of which I could give no account at last lost all patience and in plain terms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use As I could only oppose my single asseveration to this suspicion he told me one day  "By gar your vord not be give me de satisfactionme find necessaire to chercher for my medicine pardonnez moyil faut chercherme demand le clef of your coffre a cette heure"  Then raising his voice to conceal the fright he was in lest I should make any opposition he went on  "Oui foutre I charge you rendrer le clef of your coffremoisi moi qui vous parle"  I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this accusation that I burst into tears which he took for a sign of guilt and pulling out my key told him he might satisfy himself immediately though he would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my reputation had suffered from his unjust suspicionHe took the key and mounted up to my chamber attended by the whole family saying  "He bien nous verronsnous verrons"  But what was my horror and amazement when opening my  chest I saw them pull out an handful of the very things that were missing and heard him pronounce  "Ah ha vous etes bien venuesmardie Mons Roderique you be fort innocent"  I had not power to utter one word in my own vindication but stood motionless and silent while every body present made their respective remarks on what appeared against meThe servants said they were sorry for my misfortune and went away repeating  "Who would have thought it"  My mistress took occasion from this to rail against the practice of employing strangers in general and Mrs Gawky after having observed that she never had a good opinion of my fidelity proposed to have me carried before the justice and committed to Newgate immediately Her husband was actually upon the stairs in his way for a constable when Mr Lavement knowing the cost and trouble of a prosecution to which he must bind himself and at the same time dreading lest some particulars of my confession might affect his practice called out  "Restez mon fils restez it be veritablement one grand crime wich dis pauvre diable have committedbot peutetre de good God give him de penitence and me vil not have upon mine head de blood of one sinner"  The captain and his lady used all the christian arguments their zeal could suggest to prevail on the apothecary to pursue me to destruction and represented the injustice he did to the community of which he was a member in letting a villain escape who would not sail of doing more mischief in the world when he should reflect on his coming off so easily nowbut their eloquence made no impression on my master who turning to me said  "Go miserable go from mine  house quick quickand make reparation for your mauvaise actions"  By this time my indignation had roused me from the stupefaction in which I had hitherto remained and I began in this manner  "Sir appearances I own condemn me but you are imposed upon as much as I am abusedI have fallen a sacrifice to the rancour of that scoundrel pointing to Gawky who has found means to convey your goods hither that the detection of them might blast my reputation and accomplish my destructionHis hatred of me is owing to a consciousness of having wronged me in my own country for which he in a cowardly manner refused me the satisfaction of a gentlemanhe knows moreover that I am no stranger to his dastardly behaviour in this town which I have recounted beforeand he is unwilling that such a testimony of his ingratitude and pusilanimity should live upon the earth for this reason he is guilty of the most infernal malice to bring about my ruinAnd I am afraid madam turning to Mrs Gawky you have too easily entered into the sentiments of your husbandI have often found you my enemy and am well acquainted with the occasion of your being so which I don't at present think proper to declarebut I would not advise you for your own sake to drive me to extremity"  This address enraged her so much that with a face as red as scarlet and the eyes of a fury she strutted up to me and putting her hands in her sides spit in my face saying I was a scandalous villain but she defied my malice and that unless her papa would prosecute me like a thief as I was she would not  stay another night under his roofAt the same time Gawky assuming a big look told me he scorned what lies I could invent against him but that if I pretended to asperse his wife he would put me to death by GdTo this I answered  "I wish to God I could meet with thee in a desart that I might have an opportunity of revenging thy perfidy towards me and rid the world of such a rascalWhat hinders me this moment said I seizing an old bottle that stood by from doing myself that justice"  I had no sooner armed myself in this manner than Gawky and his fatherin law retired in such a hurry that the one overturned the other and rolled together down stairs while my mistress swooned away with fear and her daughter asked if I intended to murder herI gave her to understand that nothing was farther from my intention that I would leave her to the stings of her own conscience but was firmly resolved to slit her husband's nose whenever fortune should offer a convenient opportunityThen going down stairs I met Lavement coming up trembling with the pestle in his hand and Gawky behind armed with his sword pushing him forwardI demanded a parley and having assured them of my pacific disposition Gawky exclaimed  "Ah villain you have killed my dear wife"  And the apothecary cried  "Ah coquin vere is my child"  "The lady said I is above stairs unhurt by me and will a few months hence I believe reward your concern"  Here she called to them herself and desired they would let the wretch go and trouble themselves no farther about himTo which her father consented observing nevertheless  that my conversation was fort mysterieuxFinding it impossible to vindicate my innocence I left the house immediately and went to the schoolmaster with an intention of clearing myself to him and asking his advice with regard to my future conduct but to my inexpressible vexation was told he was gone to the country where he would stay two or three daysI returned with a design of consulting some acquaintance I had acquired in my master's neighbourhood but my story had taken air through the officiousness of the servants and not one of my friends would vouchsafe me a hearingThus I found myself by the iniquity of mankind in a much more deplorable condition than ever for though I had been formerly as poor my reputation was without blemish and my health unimpaired till nowbut at present my good name was lost my money gone my friends were alienated my body infected by a distemper contracted in the course of an amour and my faithful Strap who alone could yield me pity and assistance absent I knew not where  The first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture was to remove my cloaths to the house of the person with whom I had formerly lodg'd there I remained two days in hopes of getting another place by the interest of Mr Concordance to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my characterbut in this I reckoned without my host for Lavement took care to be beforehand with me and when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the schoolmaster I found him so prepossessed against me that he would scarce bear me to an end but when I had finished my justification shook his head and beginning with his  usual exclamation  "O Chst said that won't go down with meI am very sorry I should have the misfortune of being concerned in the affair but however shall be more cautious for the futureI will trust no man from henceforwardno not my father who begat menor the brother who lay with me in my mother's wombshould the genius of truth appear I would question its veracity and if Daniel would rise from the dead I should think him an impostor"  I told him that one day it was possible he might be convinced of the injury I had suffered and repent of his premature determinationTo which he answered the proof of my innocence would make his bowels vibrate with joy  "but till that shall happen continued he I must beg to have no manner of connection with youmy reputation is at stakeO my good God I shall be looked upon as your accomplice and abettorpeople will say Jonathan Wild was but a type of meboys will hoot at me as I pass along and the cinder wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with ginI shall be notoriousthe very butt of slander and cloaca of infamy"  I was not in an humour to relish the climax of expressions upon which this gentleman valued himself in all his discourses but without any ceremony took my leave cursed with every sentiment of horror which my situation could suggestI considered however in the intervals of my despondence that I must in some shape suit my expence to my calamitous circumstances and with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St Giles's at the rate of ninepence  per  weekIn this place I resolved  to perform my own cure having first pawned three shirts to purchase medicines and support for the occasion  One day when I sat in this solitary retreat musing upon the unhappiness of my fate I was alarmed by a groan that issued from a chamber contiguous to mine into which I immediately run and sound a woman stretched on a miserable truckle bed without any visible signs of life Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose the blood began to revisit her cheeks and she opened her eyes but good heaven what were the emotions of my soul when I discovered her to be the same individual lady who had triumphed over my heart and to whose fate I had almost been inseparably joined Her deplorable situation filled my breast with compassion and every tender idea reviving in my imagination I flew into her embrace she knew me immediately and straining me gently in her arms shed a torrent of tears which I could not help encreasing At length casting a languishing look at me she pronounced with a feeble voice  "Dear Mr Random I do not deserve this concern at your handsI am a vile creature who had a base design upon your personsuffer me to expiate that and all my other crimes by a miserable death which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours"  I encouraged her as much as I could told her I forgave all the injury she had designed for me and that although my circumstances were extremely low I would share my last farthing with herIn the mean time begged to know the immediate cause of that fit from which she had just recovered and I would endeavour by my skill to prevent any more such attacks  She seemed very much affected with what I said took my hand and pressed it to her lips saying  "You are too generous I wish I could live to express my gratitudebut alas I perish for want"  Then shutting her eyes relapsed into another swoonSuch extremity of distress must have waked the most obdurate heart to sympathy and compassion What effect then must it have on mine that was naturally prone to every tender passion I ran down stairs and sent my landlady to a chymist's shop for some cinnamonwater while I returning to this unfortunate creature's chamber used all the means in my power to bring her to herself which with much difficulty I accomplished and made her drink a glass of the cordial to recruit her spirits then I prepared a little mulled red wine and a toast which having taken she found herself thoroughly revived and informed me that she had not tasted food for eight and forty hours beforeAs I was impatient to know the occasion and nature of her calamity she gave me to understand that she was a woman of the town by professionthat in the course of her adventures she found herself dangerously infected with a distemper to which all of her class are particularly subjectthat her malady gaining ground every day she was become loathsome to herself as well as to every one else when she resolved to retire to some obscure corner where she might be cured with as little noise and expence as possiblethat she had accordingly chosen this place of retreat and put herself into the hands of an advertising doctor who having sleeced her of all the money she had or could procure left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in which he found herthat except the  cloaths on her back she had pawned or sold every thing that belonged to her to satisfy that rapacious quack and quiet the clamour of her landlady who still persisted in her threats to turn her out into the streetAfter having moralized upon these particulars I proposed that she should lodge in the same room with me which would save some money and assured her I would myself undertake her cure as well as my own during which she should partake of all the conveniencies I could afford to myselfShe embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment and I began to put it in practice immediatelyI found to my great satisfaction in her not only an agreeable companion whose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin but also a careful nurse who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection One day while I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty good sense and education for she had a large portion of each could be reduced to such an infamous and miserable way of life as that of a prostitute she answered with a sigh  "These very advantages were the cause of my undoing"  This remarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree that I begged she would favour me with the particulars of her story and she complied in these words  CHAP XXII  The history of Miss WILLIAMS  MY father was an eminent merchant in the city who having in the course of trade suffered very considerable losses retired in his old age with his wife to a small estate in the country which he had purchased with the remains of his fortuneAt that time I being but eight years of age was left in town for the convenience of education boarded with an aunt who was a rigid Presbyterian and who confined me so closely to what she called the duties of religion that in time I grew weary of her doctrines and by degrees conceived an aversion for the good books she daily recommended to my perusal As I increased in age and appeared with a person not disagreeable I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own sex one of whom after having lamented the restraint I was under from the narrowness of my aunt's sentiments told me I must now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example and learn to think for myselffor which purpose she advised me to read Locke Shaftsbury Tindal Hobbs and all the books that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking and by comparing one with another I would soon be able to form a system of my ownI followed her advice and whether it was owing to my prepossession against what I had formerly  read or the clearness of argument in these my new instructors I know not but I studied them with pleasure and in a short time became a professed Freethinker Proud of my new improvement I argued in all companies and that with such success that I soon acquired the reputation of a philosopher and few people durst undertake me in a disputeI grew vain upon my good fortune and at length pretended to make my aunt a proselyte to my opinion but she no sooner perceived my drift than taking the alarm she wrote to my father an account of my heresy and conjured him as he tendered the good of my soul to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful principles Accordingly my father ordered me into the country where I arrived in the fifteenth year of my age and by his command gave him a detail of all the articles of my faith which he did not find so unreasonable as they had been representedFinding myself suddenly deprived of the company and pleasures of the town I grew melancholy and it was some time before I could relish my situationBut solitude became every day more and more familiar to me and I consoled myself in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library at such times as were not employed in the management of the family for my mother had been dead three years in visiting or some other party of rural diversionHaving more imagination than judgment I addicted myself too much to poetry and romance and in short was looked upon as a very extraordinary person by every body in the country where I residedI had one evening strayed with a book in my hand into a wood that bordered on  the high road at a little distance from my father's house when a certain drunken 'squire riding by perceived me and crying  "Zds there's a charming creature"  alighted in a moment catched me in his arms and treated me so rudely that I shrieked as loud as I could and in the mean time opposed his violence with all the strength that rage and resentment could inspireDuring this struggle another horseman came up who seeing a lady so unworthily used dismounted and flew to my assistanceMy ravisher mad with disappointment or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman quitted me and running to his horse drew a pistol from the saddle and fired it at my protector who happily receiving no damage went up and with the butt end of his whip laid him prostrate on the ground before he could use the other which his antagonist immediately seized and clapping to the 'squire's breast threatned to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery Upon this I interposed and begged his life which was granted to my request after he had asked pardon and swore his intention was only to obtain a kissHowever my defender thought proper to unload the other pistol and throw away the flints before he gave him his libertyThis courteous stranger conducted me home where my father having learned the signal service he had done me loaded him with caresses and insisted on his lodging that night at our houseIf the obligation he had conferred upon me justly inspired me with sentiments of gratitude his appearance and conversation seemed to intitle him to somewhat moreHe was about the age of two and twenty among the tallest of the middlesize  had chesnut coloured hair which he wore tied up in a ribbon a high polished forehead a nose inclining to the aquiline lively blue eyes red pouting lips teeth as white as snow and a certain openness of countenancebut what need I describe any more particulars of his person I hope you will do me the justice to believe I do not flatter when I say he was the exact resemblance of you and if I had not been well acquainted with his family and pedigree I should have made no scruple of concluding him your brotherHe spoke little and seemed to have no reserve for what he said was ingenuous sensible and uncommonIn short said she bursting into tears he was formed for the ruin of our sexHis behaviour was modest and respectful but his looks were so significant that I could easily observe he secretly blessed the occasion that introduced him to my acquaintanceWe learned from his discourse that he was eldest son of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood to whose name we were no strangers that he had been to visit an acquaintance in the country from whose house he was returning home when my shrieks brought him to my rescueAll night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous expectations There was so much of knighterrantry in this gentleman's coming to the relief of a damsel in distress with whom he immediately became enamoured that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of romance who being delivered from the power of a brutal giant or satyr by a generous Oroondates was bound in gratitude as well as led by inclination to yield up my affections to  him without reserve In vain did I endeavour to chastise these foolish conceits by reflexions more reasonable and severe The amusing images took full possession of my mind and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet in the language of a despairing loverNext morning after breakfast he took his leave when my father begged the favour of a further acquaintance with him to which he replied by a compliment to him and a look to me so full of eloquence and tenderness that my whole soul received the soft impressionIn a short time he repeated his visit and as a recital of the particular steps he pursued to ruin me would be too tedious and impertinent let it suffice to say he made it his business to insinuate himself into my esteem by convincing me of his own good sense and at the same time flattering my understanding This he performed in the most artful manner by seeming to contradict me often through misapprehension that I might have an opportunity of clearing myself the more to my own honourHaving thus secured my good opinion he began to give me some tokens of a particular passion founded on a veneration for the qualities of my mind and as an accidental ornament admir'd the beauties of my person till at length being fully persuaded of his conquest he chose a a proper season for the theme and disclos'd his love in terms so ardent and sincere that it was impossible for me to disguise the sentiments of my heart and he received my approbation with the most lively transport After this mutual declaration we contrived to meet more frequently which we did in private interviews where we enjoy'd the conversation of one another in all  the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope that reciprocal adoration can inspireHe professed his honourable intentions of which I made no question lamented the avaritious disposition of his father who had destin'd him for the arms of another and vowed eternal fidelity with such an appearance of candour and devotion that I became a dupe to his deceit and in an evil hour crowned his eager desire with full possessionCursed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace for a momentary gratification which has entailed upon me such misery and horror cursed be my beauty that first attracted the attention of the seducer cursed be my education that by refining my sentiments made my heart the more susceptible cursed be my good sense that fixed me to one object and taught me the preference I enjoyed was but my due Had I been ugly no body would have tempted me had I been ignorant the charms of my person would not have atoned for the coarseness of my conversation had I been giddy my vanity would have divided my inclinations and my ideas would have been so diffused that I should never have listened to the enchantments of one alone  But to return to my unfortunate story we gave a loose to guilty pleasure which for some months banished every other concernBut by degrees his visits became less frequent and his behaviour less warm I perceived his coldness my heart took the alarm my tears reproached him and I insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me that whatever should happen my reputation might be safe He seemed to acquiesce in my proposal and lest me on pretence  of finding a proper clergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlockBut alas the Inconstant had no intention to return I waited a whole week with the utmost impatience sometimes doubting his honour at other times inventing excuses for him and condemning myself for harbouring the least suspicion of his faithAt length I understood from a gentleman who dined at our house that this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London with his bride to buy cloaths for their approaching nuptialsThis information distracted me the more so as I found myself some months gone with child and reflected that it would be impossible to conceal my disgrace which would not only ruin the character I had acquired in the country but also bring the grey hairs of an indulgent parent with sorrow to the grave Rage took possession of my soul I denounced a thousand imprecations and formed as many schemes of revenge against the traitor who had undone me then my resentment would subside to silent sorrow I recalled the tranquility I had lost I wept over my infatuation and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene and for a moment cheer my drooping heart I would revolve all the favourable circumstances of his character repeat the vows he made ascribe his absence to the vigilance of a suspicious father who compelled him to a match his soul abhorred and comfort myself with the expectation of seeing him before the thing should be brought to any terms of agreementBut how vain was my imagination The villain left me without remorse and in a few days the news of his marriage spread all over the countryMy horror was then inconceivable  and had not the desire of revenge diverted the resolution I should infallibly have put an end to my miserable lifeMy father observed the symptoms of my despair and though I have good reason to believe he guessed the cause was at a great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction while he endeavoured with paternal fondness to alleviate my distress I saw his concern which increased my anguish and raised my fury against the author of my calamity to an implacable degree Having furnished myself with a little money I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the nighttime and about break of day arrived at a small town from whence a stagecoach set out for London in which I embarked and next day alighted in town the spirit of revenge having supported me all the way against every other reflectionMy first care was to hire a lodging in which I kept myself very retired having assumed a feigned name that my character and situation might be the better concealedIt was not long before I found out the house of my ravisher whither I immediately repaired in a transport of rage determined to act some desperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair though the hurry of my spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a particular plan When I demanded admission to Lothario so let me call him I was desired to send up my name and business but this I refused telling the porter I had business for his master's private ear Upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he should be informed of my requestThere I remained about a quarter of an hour when a servant entered and told me his master was engaged with company and begged to be  excused at that timeMy temper could hold out no longer I pulled a poignard from my bosom where I had concealed it and rushing out flew up stairs like a fury exclaiming  "Where is this perfidious villain could I once plunge this dagger into his false heart I would then die satisfied"  The noise I made alarmed not only the servants but the company also who hearing my threats came forwards to the staircase to see what was the matter By this time I was seized disarmed and withheld by two footmen in this situation I felt the most exquisite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife I could not endure the sight was deprived of my senses and fell into a severe fit during which I know not how I was treated but when I recovered the use of reflection found myself on a bed in a paultry apartment where I was attended by an old woman who asked a thousand impertinent questions relating to my condition and informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into confusion that Lothario affirmed I was mad and pretended to have me sent to Bedlam but my lady persuaded herself there was more in my conduct than he cared should be known and had taken to her bed on bare suspicion having first ordered that I should be narrowly looked toI heard all she said without making any other reply than desiring she would do me the favour to call a chair but this she told me could not be done without her master's consent which however was easily procured and I was conveyed to my own lodging in a state of mind that baffles all description The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever which brought on a miscarriage and I believe it is well for my  conscience that heaven thus disposed of my burden for let me own to you with penitence and horror if I had brought a living child into the world my frenzy would have prompted me to sacrifice the little innocent to my resentment of the wrongs done me by the father  After this event my rage abated and my hate became more deliberate and calm when one day my landlady informed me that there was a gentleman below who desired to see me having something of consequence to impart which he was sure would contribute to my peace of mindI was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration which I attempted to interpret a thousand ways and before I came to any determination he entered my room with an apology for intruding upon me against my knowledge or consentI surveyed him some time but could not remember to have seen him before then with a faultering accent demanded what was his business with meUpon which he desired I would give him a particular audience and he did not doubt of communicating something that would conduce to my satisfaction and repose As I thought myself sufficiently guarded against any violence I granted his request and bid the woman withdrawThe stranger then advancing gave me to understand that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my story having been informed of them from Lothario's own mouththat from the time he knew my misfortunes he had entertained a detestation for the author of them which had of late been increased and inflamed to a desire of revenge by a piece of dishonourable conduct towards himthat hearing of my melancholy situation he had come with an intention of offering his assistance  and comfort and was ready to espouse my quarrel and forthwith take vengeance on my seducer provided I would grant him one consideration which he hoped I should see no reason to refuseHad all the artifice of hell been employed in composing a persuasive it could not have had a more instantaneous or favourable effect than this discourse had upon meI was transported with a delirium of gloomy joy I hugged my companion in my arms and vowed that if he would make good his promise my soul and body should be at his disposalThe contract was made he devoted himself to my revenge undertook to murder Lothario that very night and to bring me an account of his death before morningAccordingly about two of the clock he was introduced to my chamber and assured me my perfidious lover was no more that although he was not entitled to such an honourable proceeding he had fairly challenged him to the field where he upbraided him with his treachery towards me for whom he told him his sword was drawn and after a few passes left him weltering in his bloodI was so savaged by my wrongs that I delighted in the recital of this adventure made him repeat the particulars feasted my eyes with the blood that remained on his cloaths and sword and yielded up my body as a recompence for the service he had done me My imagination was so engrossed by these ideas that in my sleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me pale mangled and bloody blamed my rashness protested his innocence and pleaded his own cause so pathetically that I was convinced of his fidelity and waked in a sit of horror and remorseMy bedfellow endeavoured to soo  console and persuade me that I had but barely done justice to myselfI dropt asleep again and the same apparition recurred to my fancyIn short I passed the night in great misery and looked upon my avenger with such abhorrence that in the morning perceiving my aversion he insinuated there was still a possibility of Lothario's recovery it was true be left him wounded on the ground but not quite dead and perhaps his hurts might not be mortalAt these words I started up bid him fly for intelligence and if he could not bring me tidings of Lothario's safety at least consult his own and never return for I was resolved to surrender myself to justice and declare all that I knew of the affair that if possible I might expiate my own guilt by incurring the rigours of a sincere repentance and ignominious deathHe very coolly represented the unreasonableness of my prejudice against him who had done nothing but what his love of me inspired and honour justifiedthat now he had at the risk of his life been subservient to my revenge I was about to discard him as an infamous agent occasionally necessary and that even if he should be so lucky as to bring news of Lothario's safety it was probable my former resentment might revive and I would upbraid him with having failed in his undertakingI assured him that on the contrary he would be dearer to me than ever as I should be convinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour than on those of a mercenary assassin and scorned to take away the life of an adversary how inveterate soever which fortune had put in his power  "Well then madam said he whatever may have happened I shall find it no difficult matter  to satisfy you in that"  And took his leave in order to enquire into the consequences of his duelI was now more sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery all the affliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and weakness and my conscience could only accuse me of venal crimes but now that I looked upon myself as a murderer it is impossible to express the terrors of my imagination which was incessantly haunted by the image of the deceased and my bosom stung with the most exquisite agonies of which I saw no endAt length Horatio for so I shall call my keeper returned and telling me I had nothing to fear delivered into my hands a billet containing these words  MADAM  AS I understand it is of consequence to your peace I take this liberty to inform you that the wounds I received from Horatio are not mortal This satisfaction my humanity could not deny even to a person who has endeavoured to disturb the repose as well destroy the life of  Lothario  Being well acquainted with his hand I had no reason to suspect an imposition in this letter which I read over and over with a transport of joy and caressed Horatio so much that he appeared the happiest men alive Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater misfortune  than that which depressed meGriefs are like usurpers the most powerful deposes all the restBut my raptures were not lastingthat very letter which in a manner reestablished my tranquility in a little time banished my peaceHis unjust reproaches while they waked my resentment recalled my former happiness and filled my soul with rage and sorrowHoratio perceiving the situation of my mind endeavoured to divert my chagrin by treating me with all the amusements and entertainments of the town I was gratified with every indulgence I could desire introduced into the company of other keptmistresles by whom an uncommon deference was paid me and I began to lose all remembrance of my former condition when an accident brought it back to my view with all its interesting circumstancesDiverting myself one day with some news papers which I had not before perused the following advertisement attracted my attention  "WHEREAS a young gentlewoman disappeared from her father's house in the county of about the end of September on account as is supposed of some uneasiness of mind and has not been as yet heard of whoever will give an information about her to Mrof Gray'sInn shall be handsomely rewarded or if she will return to the arms of her disconsolate parent she will be received with the utmost tenderness whatever reasons she may have to think otherwise and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father already weighed down almost to the grave with age and sorrow"  This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on me that I was fully resolved to return like the prodigal son and implore the forgiveness of him who gave me life but alas upon inquiry I found he had paid his debt to nature a month before lamenting my absence to his last hour having left his fortune to a stranger as a mark of his resentment of my unkind and undutiful behaviourPenetrated with remorse on this occasion I sunk into the most profound melancholy and considered myself as the immediate cause of his deathI lost all relish for company and indeed most of my acquaintances no sooner perceived my change of temper than they abandoned me Horatio disgusted at my insensibility or which is more probable cloyed with possession became colder and colder every day till at last he left me altogether without making any apology for his conduct or securing me against the miseries of want as a man of honour ought to have done considering the share he had in my ruin for I afterwards learned that the quarrel between Lothario and him was a story trumped up to rid the one of my importunities and give the other the enjoyment of my person which it seems he lusted after upon seeing me at the house of my seducerReduced to this extremity I cursed my own simplicity uttered horrid imprecations against the treachery of Horatio and as I became every day more and more familiarized to the loss of innocence resolved to be revenged on the sex in general by practising their own arts upon themselvesNor was an opportunity long wanting An old gentlewoman under pretence of sympathizing visited me and after having condoled with me on my misfortunes  and professed a disinterested friendship began to display the art of her occupation in encomiums on my beauty and invectives against the wretch who had forsaken me insinuating withal that it would be my own fault if I did not still make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed meI soon understood her drift and gave her such encouragement to explain herself that we came to an agreement immediately to divide the profits of my prostitution accruing from such gallants as she should introduce to my acquaintance The first stroke of my dissimulation was practised upon a certain Jge to whom I was recommended by this matron as an innocent creature just arrived from the country he was so transported with my appearance and feigned simplicity that he paid a hundred guineas for the possession of me for one night only during which I behaved in such a manner as to make him perfectly well pleased with his purchase  CHAP XXIII  She is interrupted by a bailif who arrests and carries her to the MarshalseaI accompany herbring witnesses to prove she is not the same person named in the writthe bailif is fain to give her a present and discharge herwe shift our lodgingshe resumes her story and ends itmy reflections thereuponshe makes me acquainted with the progress of a common woman of the townresolves to quit that way of life  HER story was here interrupted by a rap at the door which I no sooner opened than three or four terrible fellows rushed in one of whom accosted my fellow lodger thus  "Madam your servantyou must do me the favour to come along with meI have got a writ against you"  While the bailif for so he was spoke thus his followers surrounded the prisoner and began to handle her very roughlyThis treatment incensed me so much that I snatched up the poker and would certainly have used it in defence of the lady without any regard to the strength and number of her adversaries had not she begged me with a composure of countenance for which I could not account to use no violence in her behalf which could be of no service to her but might be very detrimental  to myselfThen turning to the leader of this formidable troop she desired to see the warrant and having perused it said with a faultering voice  "I am not the person whose name is here mentioned arrest me at your peril"  "Ay ay Madam replied the catchpole we shall prove your identityIn the mean time whether will you be pleased to be carried to my house or to Jail"  "If I must be confined said she I would rather have your house for a prison than a common Jail"  "Well well answered he if you have money enough in your pocket you shall be entertained like a princess"  But when she acquainted him with her poverty he swore he never gave credit and ordered one of his myrmidons to call a coach to carry her to the Marshalsea at onceWhile this was a doing she took me aside and bid me be under no concern on her account for she knew how to extricate herself from this difficulty very soon and perhaps gain something by the occasionAlthough her discourse was a mystery to me I was very well pleased with her assurance and when the coach came to the door offered to accompany her to prison to which after much intreaty she consentedWhen we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea our conductor alighted and having demanded entrance presented the writ to the turnkey who no sooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Cary than he cried  "Ah ha my old acquaintance Bett I'm glad to see thee with all my heart"  So saying he opened the coach door and helped her to dismount but when he observed her face he started back saying  "Zds who have we got here"  The bailif alarmed at this interrogation  cried with some emotion  "Who the devil should it be but the prisoner Elizabeth Cary"  The turnkey replied  "That Elizabeth CaryI'll be damned if that's Elizabeth Cary more than my grandmotherDn my blood I know Bett Cary as well as if I had made her"  Here the lady thought fit to interpose and tell the catchpole if he had taken her word for it at first he might have saved himself and her a great deal of trouble  "It may be so answered he but by Gd I'll have further evidence that you are not the person before you and I part"  "Yes yes said she you shall have further evidence to your cost"  Upon this we adjourned into the lodge and called for a bottle of wine where my companion wrote a direction to two of her acquaintance and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings and request them to come to her immediately I found them together at a house in Bridges's street Drurylane and as they were luckily unengaged they set out with me in a hackneycoach without hesitation after I had related the circumstances of the affair which flattered them with hopes of seeing a bailif trounced for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailifs as that subsisting between mice and catsAccordingly when they entered the lodge they embraced the prisoner very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams and asked how long she had been nabb'd and for whatOn hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated they offered to swear before a justice of peace that she was not the person mentioned in the writ whom it seems they all knew but the bailif who by this time was convinced of  told them he would not  put them to that trouble  "Ladies said he there's no harm doneyou shall give me leave to treat you with another bottle and then we'll part friends"  This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood and miss Williams told him Sure he did not imagine her such a fool as to be satisfied with a paultry glass of sour wineHere the turnkey interrupted her by affirming with an oath that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue  "Well continued she that may bebut was it the best of champaign it is no recompence for the damage I have suffered both in character and health by being wrongfully dragged to jailAt this rate no innocent person is safe since any officer of justice out of malice private pique or mistake may injure and oppress the subject with impunitybut thank heaven I live under the protection of laws that will not suffer such insults to pass unpunished and I know very well how to procure redress"  Mr Vulture for that was the bailif's name finding he had to deal with one who would not be imposed upon began to look very sullen and perplexed and leaning his forehead on his hand entered into a deliberation with himself which lasted a few minutes and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curses against the old bch our landlady as he called her for having misinformed himAfter much wrangling and swearing the matter was referred to the decision of the turnkey who calling for the other bottle mulcted the bailif in all the liquor that had been drank coachhire and a couple of guineas for the use of the plaintifThe money was immediately deposited miss Williams gratified the two  evidences with one half and putting the other in her pocket drove home with me leaving the catchpole grumbling over his loss yet pleased in the main for having so cheaply got clear of a business that might have cost him ten times the sum and his place to bootThis guinea was a very seasonable relief to us who were reduced to great necessity six of my shirts and almost all my cloaths except those on my back being either pawned or sold for our maintenance before this happenedAs we resented the behaviour of our landlandy our first care was to provide ourselves with another lodging whither we removed next day with an intention to keep ourselves as retired as possible until our cure should be compleatedWhen we were fixed in our new habitation I intreated her to finish the story of her Life which she pursued in this manner  The success of our experiment on the Jge encouraged us to practice the same deceit on others and my virginity was five times sold to good purpose but this harvest lasted not long my character taking air and my directress deserting me for some new game Whereupon I took lodgings near Charing cross at two guineas  per  week and began to entertain company in a public mannerBut my income being too small to defray my expence I was obliged to retrench and enter into articles with the porters of certain taverns who undertook to find employment enough for me provided I would share my profits with themAccordingly I was almost every night engaged with company among whom I was exposed to every mortification danger and abuse that flow from drunkenness brutality and disease  How miserable is the condition of a courtezan whose business it is to sooth suffer and obey the dictates of rage insolence and lustAs my spirit was not sufficiently humbled to the will not my temper calculated for the conversation of my gallants it was impossible for me to overcome an aversion I felt for my profession which manifested itself in a settled gloom on my countenance and disgusted these sons of mirth and riot so much that I was frequently used in a shocking manner and kicked down stairs with disgraceThe messengers seeing me disagrecable to their benefactors and employers seldom troubled me with a call and I began to find myself almost totally neglected To contribute towards my support I was fain to sell my watch rings trinkets with the best part of my cloaths and I was one evening musing by myself on the misery before me when I received a message from a bagnio whither I repaired in a chair and was introduced to a gentleman dressed like an officer with whom I supped  tête a tête  in a sumptuous manner and after drinking a hearty glass of champaign went to bedIn the morning when I awoke I found my gallant had got up and drawing as  the curtain could not perceive him in the room this gave me some uneasiness but  he might have retired on some necessary occasion I waited a full hour for his return and then in the greatest perplexity got up and rung the bellWhen the waiter came to the door he found it locked and desired admittance which I granted after observing with great surprize that the key remained on the inside as when we went to bed I no sooner enquired for the captain than the fellow staring with a distracted  look cried  "How madam is he not abed"  And when he was satisfied as to that run into a closet adjoining to the chamber the window of which he found openThrough this the adventurer had got upon a wall from whence he dropped down into a court and escaped leaving me to be answerable not only for the reckoning but also for a large silver tankard and possetbowl which he had carried off with himIt is impossible to describe the consternation I was under when I saw myself detained as a thief's accomplice for I was looked upon in that light and carried before a justice who mistaking my confusion for a sign of guilt committed me after a short examination to Bridewell having advised me as the only means to save my life to turn evidence and impeach my confederateI now concluded the vengeance of heaven had overtaken me and that I must soon finish my carreer by an ignominious deathThis reflection sunk so deep into my soul that I was for some days deprived of my reason and actually believed myself in hell tormented by fiends Indeed there needs not a very extravagant imagination to form that conjecture for of all the scenes on earth that of Bridewell approaches nearest the idea I had always entertained of the infernal regionsHere I saw nothing but rage anguish and impiety and heard nothing but groans curses and blasphemyIn the midst of this hellish crew I was subjected to the tyranny of a barbarian who imposed upon me tasks that I could not possibly perform and then punished my incapacity with the utmost rigour and inhumanity I was often whipt into a swoon and lashed out of it during which miserable intervals I was robbed by my  fellowprisoners of every thing about me even to my cape shoes and stockings I was not only destitute of necessaries but even of food so that my wretchedness was extreme Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my situation would grant me the least succour or regard on pretence of my being committed for theft and my landlord refused to part with some of my own cloaths which I sent for because I was indebted to him for a week's lodgingOverwhelmed with calamity I grew desperate and resolved to put an end to my grievances and life together for this purpose I got up in the middle of the night when I thought every body round me asleep and fixing one end of my handkerchief to a large hook in the ceiling that supported the scales on which the hemp is weighed I stood upon a chair and making a noose on the other end put my neck into it with an intention to hang myself but before I could adjust the knot I was surprised and prevented by two women who had been awake all the while and suspected my designIn the morning my attempt was published among the prisoners and punished with thirty stripes the pain of which cooperating with my disappointment and disgrace bereft me of my senses and threw me into an extasy of madness wherein I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth and dashed my head against the pavementSo that they were obliged to set a watch over me to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and othersThis fit of phrenzy continued three days at the end of which I grew calm and sullen but as the desire of making away with myself still remained I came to a determination of starving myself to death and with that view refused all sustenance  Whether it was owing to the want of opposition or to the weakness of nature I know not but on the second day of my fast I found my resolution considerably impaired and the calls of hunger almost insupportableAt this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the prison with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio she was then on the same footing as I was but afterwards quarreling with her gallant and not finding another to her mind altered her scheme of life and set up a coffeehouse among the hundreds of Drury where she entertained gentlemen with claret arrack and the choice of half a dozen damsels who lived in her house This serviceable matron having neglected to gratify a certain jce for the connivance she enjoyed was indicted at the quarter sessions in consequence of which her bevy was dispersed and herself committed to BridewellShe had not been long there before she learned my disaster and coming up to me after a compliment of condolance enquired into the particulars of my fate While we were engaged in discourse together the master coming up told me that the fellow on whose account I had suffered was taken that he had confessed the theft and cleared me of any concern in the affair for which reason he the master had orders to discharge me and that I was from that moment free This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death and had such an instantaneous effect on my countenance that Mrs Coupler the lady then present hoping to find her account in me very generously offered to furnish me with what necessaries I wanted and take me into her own house as soon as she could  compromise matters with the jcesThe conditions of her offer were that I should pay three guineas weekly for my board and a reasonable consideration besides for the use of such cloaths and ornaments as she should supply me with to be deducted from the first profits of my embracesThese were hard terms but not be rejected by one who was turned out helpless and naked into the wide world without a friend to pity or assist herI therefore embraced her proposal and she being bailed in a few hours took me home with her in a coach As I was by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted my admirers by my reserved and haughty behaviour I now endeavoured to conquer that disposition and the sudden change of my fortune giving me a flow of spirits I appeared in the most winning and gay manner I could assume Having the advantage of a good voice and education over most of my rivals I exerted my talents to the uttermost and soon became the favourite with all companyThis success alarmed the pride and jealousy of Mrs Coupler who could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed She therefore made a merit of her envy and whispered about among her customers that I was unsoundThere needed no more to ruin my reputation and blast my prosperity every body shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain and in a very short time I was as solitary as ever Want of gallants was attended with want of money to satisfy my malicious landlady who having purposely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds took out a writ against me and I was arrested in her own houseThough the room was crouded with people when the bailif  entered not one of them had compassion enough to attempt to molify my prosecutrix far less to pay the debt they even laughed at my tears and one of them bid me be of good cheer for I should not want admirers in Newgate At that instant a sea lieutenant came in and seeing my plight began to enquire into the circumstances of my misfortune when this wit advised him to keep clear of me for I was a fireship  "A fireship replied the sailor more like a poor galley in distress that has been boarded by such a fireship as you if so be that be the case she stands in more need of assistanceHarkee my girl how far have you overrun the constable"  I told him that the debt amounted to eleven pounds besides the expence of the writ  "An that be all said he you shan't go to the bilboes this bout"  And taking out his purse paid the money discharged the bailif and telling me I had got into the wrong port advised me to seek out a more convenient harbour where I could be safely hove down for which purpose he made me a present of five guineas moreI was so touched with this singular piece of generosity that for some time I had not power to thank himHowever as soon as I had recollected myself I begged the favour of him to go with me to the next tavern where I explained the nature of my disaster and convinced him of the falsehood of what was reported to my prejudice so effectually that he from that moment attached himself to me and we lived in great harmony together until he was obliged to go to sea where he perished in a storm  Having lost my benefactor and almost consumed the remains of his bounty I saw myself  in danger of relapsing into my former necessity and began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailifs and jailswhen one of the sisterhood a little stale advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town where I was unknown and pass for an heiress which might entrap some body to be my husband who would possibly be able to allow me an handsome maintenance or at wont screen me from the dread and danger of a prison by becoming liable for whatever debts I should contractI approved of this scheme towards the execution of which my companion clubbed her wardrobe and undertook to live with me in quality of my maid with the proviso that she should be reimbursed and handsomely considered out of the profits of my successShe was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place and that very day hired a genteel apartment in Parkstreet whither I moved in a coach loaded with her baggage and my ownI made my first appearance in a blue ridinghabit trimmed with silver and my maid acted her part so artfully that in a day or two my fame was spread all over the neighbourhood and I was said to be a rich heiress just arrived from the countryThis report brought a swarm of gay young fellows about me but I soon found them out to be all indigent adventurers like myself who crouded to me like crows to a carrion with a view of preying upon my fortuneI maintained however the appearance of wealth as long as possible in hopes of gaining some admirer more for my purpose and at length I attracted the regard of one who would have satisfied my wishes and managed matters so well that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials In the interim he begged leave to  introduce an intimate friend to me which request as I could not refuse I had the extreme mortification and surprize to see next night in that friend my old keeper Horatio who no sooner beheld me than he changed colour but had presence of mind enough to advance and salute me bidding me with a low voice be under no apprehension for he would not expose meIn spite of this assurance I could not recover myself so far as to entertain them but withdrew to my chamber on pretence of a severe headach to the no small concern of my adorer who took his leave in the tenderest manner and went off with his friend  Having imparted my situation to my companion she found it high time for us to decamp and that without any noise because we were not only indebted to our landlady but also to several tradesmen in the neighbourhoodOur retreat therefore was concerted and executed in this manner Having packed up all our cloaths and moveables in small parcels she on pretence of fetching cordials for me carried them at several times to the house of an acquaintance where she likewise procured a lodging to which we retired in the middle of the night opening the street door when every other body in the house was asleepI was now obliged to aim at lower game and accordingly spread my nets among trades people but found them all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions till at last I became acquainted with you on whom I practised all my dexterity not that I believed you had any fortune or expectation of one but that I might transfer the burthen of such debts as I had incurred or could contract from myself to another and at the same time avenge myself of your sex by  rendering miserable one who bore such resemblance to the wretch who ruined mebut heaven preserved you from my snares by the discovery you made which was owing to the negligence of my maid in leaving the chamberdoor unlocked when she went to buy sugar for breakfastThe person in bed with me was a gentleman whom I had allured the night before as he walked homeward pretty much elevated with liquor for by this time my condition was so low that I was forced to turn out in the twilight to the streets in hopes of preyWhen I found myself detected and forsaken by you I was fain to move my lodging and dwell two pair of stairs higher than before My companion being disappointed in her expectations left me to trade upon her own bottom and I had no other resource than to venture forth like the owls in the dark to pick up a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence I have often sauntered between Ludgatehill and Charingcross a whole winternight exposed not only to the inclemency of the weather but likewise to the rage of hunger and thirst without being so happy as to meet with one cully then creep up to my garret in a deplorable draggled condition sneak to bed and try to bury my appetite and sorrows in sleepWhen I lighted on some rake or tradesman reeling home drunk I frequently suffered the most brutal treatment in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good humour tho' my soul was stung with resentment and disdain and my heart loaded with grief and afflictionIn the course of these nocturnal adventures I was infected with the disease that in a short time render'd me the object of my own abhorrence and drove me to the retreat where  your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death  So much candour and good sense appeared in this lady's narration that I made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said and expressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone in so little time for all her misfortunes had happened within the compass of two yearsI compared her situation with my own and found it a thousand times more wretched I had endured hardships 'tis true my whole life had been a series of such and when I looked forward the prospect was not much betteredbut then they were become habitual to me and consequently I could bear them with less difficultyIf one scheme of life should not succeed I could have recourse to another and so to a third veering about to a thousand different shifts according to the emergencies of my fate without forfeiting the dignity of my character beyond a power of retrieving it or subjecting myself wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world On the other hand she had known and relished the sweets of prosperity she had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent in all the delicacies to which her sex and rank entitled her and without any extravagance of hope entertained herself with the view of uninterrupted happiness thro' the whole scene of lifeHow fatal then how tormenting how intolerable must her reverse of fortune be a reverse that not only robbs her of these external comforts and plunges her into all the miseries of want but also murthers her peace of mind and entails upon her the curse of eternal infamyOf all professions I pronounced  that of a courtezan the most deplorable and her of all courtezans the most unhappyShe allowed my observation to be just in the main but at the same time affirmed that notwithstanding the disgraces which had fallen to her share she had not been so unlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others of the same community  "I have often seen said she while I strolled about the streets at midnight a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and filth huddled together like swine in the corner of a dark alley some of whom but eighteen months before I had known the favourites of the town rolling in affluence and glittering in all the pomp of equipage and dress"  And indeed the gradation is easily conceived the most fashionable woman of the town is as liable to contagion as one in a much humbler sphere she infects her admirers her situation is publick she is avoided neglected unable to support her usual appearance which however she strives to maintain as long as possible her credit fails she is obliged to retrench and become a nightwalker her malady gains ground she tampers with her constitution and ruins it her complexion fades she grows nauseous to every body finds herself reduced to a starving condition is tempted to pick pockets is detected committed to Newgate where she remains in a miserable condition 'till she is discharged because the plaintiff appears not to prosecute her No body will afford her lodging the symptoms of her distemper are grown outrageous she sues to be admitted into an hospital where she is cured at the expence of her nose she is turned out naked into the streets depends upon the addresses of the canaille is fain to allay the rage of  hunger and cold with gin degenerates into a state of brutal insensibility rots and dies upon a dunghillMiserable wretch that I am perhaps the same horrors are decreed for me  "No cried she after some pause I shall never live to such extremity of distress my own hand shall open a way for my deliverance before I arrive at that forlorn period"  Her condition filled me with sympathy and compassion I revered her qualifications looked upon her as unfortunate not criminal and attended her with such care and success that in less than two months her health as well as my own was perfectly reestablishedAs we often conferred upon our mutual affairs and interchanged advice a thousand different projects were formed which upon further canvassing appeared impracticableWe would have gladly gone to service but who would take us in without recommendation At length an expedient occurred to her of which she intended to lay hold and this was to procure with the first money she should earn the homely garb of a country wench go to some village at a good distance from town and come up in a waggon as a fresh girl for service by which means she might be provided for in a manner much more suitable to her inclination than her present way of life  CHAP XXIV  I am reduced to great miseryassaulted on Towerhill by a pressgang who put me on board a tendermy usage theremy arrival on board of the Thunder man of war where I am put in irons and afterwards released by the good offices of Mr Thomson who recommends me as assistant to the surgeonhe relates his own story and makes me acquainted with the characters of the captain surgeon and first mate  I Applauded the resolution of Miss Williams who a few days after was hired in quality of barkeeper by one of the ladies who had witnessed in her behalf at the Marshalsea and who since that time had got credit with a wine merchant whose favourite she was to set up a convenient house of her ownThither my fellow lodger repaired after having taken leave of me with a torrent of tears and a thousand protestations of eternal gratitude assuring me she would remain in this new situation no longer than till she should pick up money sufficient to put her other design in execution  As for my own part I saw no resource but the army or navy between which I hesitated so long that I found myself reduced to a starving conditionMy spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate and I became so mean as to  go down towards Wapping with an intention to enquire for an old schoolfellow of mine who I understood had got the command of a small coasting vessel then in the river and implore his assistanceBut my destiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour for as I crossed Towerwharf a squat tawny fellow with a hanger by his side and a cudgel in his hand came up to me calling  "Yo ho brother you must come along with me"  As I did not like his appearance instead of answering his salutation I quickened my pace in hopes of ridding myself of his company which he perceiving whistled aloud and immediately another sailor appeared before me who laid hold of me by the collar and began to drag me alongNot being of a humour to relish such treatment I disengaged myself of the assailant and with one blow of my cudgel laid him motionless on the ground and perceiving myself surrounded in a trice by ten or a dozen more exerted myself with such dexterity and success that some of my opponents were fain to attack me with drawn cutlasses and after an obstinate engagement in which I received a large wound on the head and another on my left cheek I was disarmed taken prisoner and carried on board a pressing tender where after being pinioned like a malefactor I was thrust down into the hold among a parcel of miserable wretches the sight of whom well nigh distracted meAs the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds to be dressed and I could not use my own hands I desired one of my fellowcaptives who was unsettered to take a handkerchief out of my pocket and tie it round my head to stop the bleeding He pulled out my  handkerchief 'tis true but instead of applying it to the use for which I designed it went to the grating of the hatchway and with astonishing composure sold it before my face to a bumboatwoman  A bum boatwoman is one who sells bread cheese greens liquor and fresh provision to the sailors in a small boat that lies alongside of the ship  then on board for a quart of gin with which he treated his companions regardless of my circumstance and intreaties  I complained bitterly of this robbery to the midshipman on deck telling him at the same time that unless my hurts were dressed I should bleed to death But compassion was a weakness of which no man could justly accuse this person who squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon me through the gratings told me  "I was a mutinous dog and that I might die and be damned"  Finding there was no other remedy I appealed to patience and laid up this usage in my memory to be recalled at a fitter seasonIn the mean time loss of blood vexation and want of food contributed with the noisome stench of the place to throw me into a swoon out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the nose administred by the tar who stood centinel over us who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip and comforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day where I would be freed from handcuffs and cured of my wounds by the doctorI no sooner heard him name the Thunder than I asked if he had belonged to that ship long and he giving me to understand he had belonged to her five years  I enquired if he knew lieutenant Bowling  "Know lieutenant Bowling said heodds my life and that I doand a good seaman he is as ever stept upon forecastleand a brave fellow as ever crackt bisketnone of your Guinea pigsnor your freshwater wishy washy fairweather fowlsMany a taught gale of wind has honest Tom Bowling and I weathered togetherHere's his health with all my heart whereever he is aloft or alowin heaven or in hellall's one for thathe needs not be ashamed to shew himself"  I was so much affected with this elogium that I could not refrain from telling him I was lieutenant Bowling's kinsman at which he expressed an inclination to serve me and when he was relieved brought some cold boiled beef in a platter and biscuit on which we supped plentifully and afterwards drank another can of flip together While we were thus engaged he recounted a great many exploits of my uncle who I found was very much beloved by the ship's company and pitied for the misfortune that happened to him in Hispaniola which I was very glad to be informed was not so great as I imagined for captain Oakhum had recovered of his wounds and actually at that time commanded the ship Having by accident in my pocket my uncle's letter written from Port Louis I gave it my benefactor whose name was Jack Rattlin for his perusal but honest Jack told me frankly he could not read and desired to know the contents which I immediately communicated When he heard that part of it in which he says he had wrote to his landlord in Deal he cried  "Body o' me that was old  Ben Blockhe was dead before the letter came to handEy ey had Ben been alive lieutenant Bowling would have had no occasion to sculk so longHonest Ben was the first man that taught him to hand reef and steerWell well we must all die that's certainwe must all come to port sooner or laterat sea or on shore we must be fast moored one daydeath's like the best bower anchor as the saying is it will bring us all up"  I could not but signify my approbation of the justness of Jack's reflections and enquired into the occasion of the quarrel between captain Oakhum and my uncle which he explained in this manner  "Captain Oakhum to be sure is a good man enoughbesides he's my commanderbut what's that to meI do my duty and value no man's anger of a rope's endNow the report goes as how he is a lord's or baron knight's brother whereby d'ye see me he carries a strait arm and keeps a loof from his officers thof may hap they may be as good men in the main as he Now we lying at anchor in Tuberoon bay lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch and as he always kept a goodlook out he made d'ye see three lights in the offing whereby he run down to the great cabbin for orders and found the captain asleepwhereupon he waked him which put him in a main high passion and he swore woundily at the lieutenant and called him lousy Scotch son of a whore for I being then centinel in the steerage heard all and swab and swabbard whereby the lieutenant returned the salute and they jawed together fore and  aft a good spell till at last the captain turned out and laying hold of a rattan came athwart Mr Bowling's quarter whereby he told the captain that if he was not his commander he would heave him overboard and demanded satisfaction ashore whereby in the morning watch the captain went ashore in the pinnace and afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter ashore and so they leaving the boats crews on their oars went away together and so d'ye see in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing whereby we made for the place and found the captain lying wounded on the beach and so brought him on board to the doctor who cured him in less than six weeks But the lieutenant clapt on all the sail he could bear and had got far enough ahead before we knew any thing of the matter so that we could never after get sight of him for which we were not sorry because the captain was mainly wroth and would certainly have done him a mischieffor he afterwards caused him to be run on the ships books whereby he lost all his pay and if he should be taken would be tried as a deserter"  This account of the captain's behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of his character and I could not help lamenting my own fate that had subjected me to such a commander However making a virtue of necessity I put a good face on the matter and next day was with the other pressed men put on board of the Thunder lying at the NoreWhen we came alongside the mate who guarded us thither ordered my handcuffs to be taken off that I might get on board the easier which being perceived by some  of the company who stood upon the gangboards to see us enter one of them called to Jack Rattlin who was busied in doing this friendly office for me  "Hey Jack what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along Have we not thieves enow among us already"  Another observing my wounds which still remained exposed to the air told me my seams were uncaulked and that I must be new payedA third seeing my hair clotted together with blood as it were into distinct cords took notice that my bows were manned with the red ropes instead of my sideA fourth asked me if I could not keep my yards square without iron braces and in short a thousand witticisms of the same nature were passed upon me before I could get up the ship's sideAfter we had been all entered upon the books I enquired at one of my shipmates where the surgeon was that I might have my wounds dressed and had actually got as far as the middle deck for our ship carried eighty guns in my way to the cockpit when I was met by the same midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender He seeing me free from my chains asked with an insolent air who had released me To this I foolishly answered with a countenance that too plainly declared the state of my thoughts  "Whoever did it I am persuaded did not consult you in the affair"  I had no sooner uttered these words than he cried  "Dn you you saucy son of a bch I'll teach you to talk so to your officer"  So saying he bestowed on me several severe stripes with a supple Jack he had in his hand and going to the commanding officer made such a report of me that I was immediately put in irons by  the master at arms and a centinel placed over meHonest Rattlin as soon as he heard of my condition came to me and administred all the consolation he could and then went to the surgeon in my behalf who sent one of his mates to dress my wounds This mate was no other than my old friend Thomson with whom I became acquainted at the Navyoffice as before mentioned If I knew him at first sight it was not so easy for him to recognize me disfigured with blood and dirt and altered by the misery I had undergoneUnknown as I was to him he surveyed me with looks of compassion and handled my sores with great tenderness When he had applied what he thought proper and was about to leave me I asked him if my misfortunes had disquised me so much that he could not recollect my face Upon this he observed me with great earnestness for some time and at length protested he could not recollect one feature of my countenanceTo keep him no longer in suspence I told him my name which when he heard he embraced me with affection and professed his sorrow in seeing me in such a disagreeable situation I made him acquainted with my story and when he heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender he left me abruptly assuring me I should see him again soon I had scarce time to wonder at his sudden departure when the master at arms came to the place of my confinement and bid me follow him to the quarterdeck where I was examined by the first lieutenant who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain touching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midshipman who was present to confront meI recounted the particulars  of his behaviour to me not only in the tender but since my being on board the ship part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others who had no great devotion for my oppressor I was discharged from confinement to make way for him who was delivered to the master at arms to take his turn in the BilboesAnd this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed for I was at the request of the surgeon exempted from all other duty than that of assisting his mates in making and administring medicines to the sickThis good office I owed to the friendship of Mr Thomson who had represented me in such a favourable light to the surgeon that he demanded me of the lieutenant to supply the place of his third mate who was lately deadWhen I had obtained this favour my friend Thomson carried me down to the cockpit which is the place allotted for the habitation of the surgeon's mates And when he had shewn me their birth as he called it I was filled with astonishment and horrorWe descended by divers ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon which I understood was immersed several feet under water being immediately above the hold I had no sooner approached this dismal gulph than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese and rancid butter that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder resembling a chandler's shop where by the faint glimmering of a candle I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance sitting behind a kind of desk having spectacles on his nose and a pen in his handThis I learned of Mr Thomson was the ship's steward who sat there to distribute provision to the several messes and to mark  what each receivedHe therefore presented my name to him and desired I might be entered in his mess then taking a light in his hand conducted me to the place of his residence which was a square of about six feet surrounded with the medicine chest that of the first mate his own and a board by way of table fastened to the mizenmast it was also enclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship to screen us from the cold as well as the view of the midshipmen and quartermasters who lodged within the cable tiers on each side of us In this gloomy mansion he entertained me with some cold salt pork which he brought from a sort of locker fixed above the table and calling for the boy of the mess sent him for a can of beer of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquetBy this time I began to recover my spirits which had been exceedingly depressed with the appearance of every thing about me and could no longer refrain from asking the particulars of Mr Thomson's fortune since I had seen him in LondonHe told me that being disappointed in his expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious stry at the Navyoffice he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer in town and had actually offered his service in quality of mate to the surgeon of a merchant's ship bound to Guinea on the slaving trade when one morning a young fellow of whom he had some acquaintance came to his lodgings and informed him that he had seen a wa rant made out in his name at the Navyoffice for surgeon's second mate of a third rate This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely believe to be true more especially as he had  been found qualified at Surgeon'shall for third mate only but that he might not be wanting to himself he went thither to be assured and actually found it so Whereupon demanding his warrant it was delivered to him and the oaths administred immediatelyThat very afternoon he went to Gravesend in the tiltboat from whence he took a place in the tidecoach for Rochester next morning got on board the Thunder for which he was appointed then lying in the harbour at Chatham and the same day was mustered by the clerk of the checqueAnd well it was for him that such expedition was used for in less then twelve hours after his arrival another William Thomson came on board affirming that he was the person for whom the warrant was expedited and that the other was an impostorMy friend was grievously alarmed at this accident the more so as his namesake had very much the advantage over him both in assurance and dressHowever to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture he produced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name and recollecting that his indentures were in his box on board he brought them up and convinced all present that he had not assumed a name which did not belong to himHis competitor enraged that they should hesitate in doing him justice for to be sure the warrant had been designed for him behaved with so much indecent heat that the commanding officer who was the same gentleman I had seen and the surgeon were offended at his presumption and making a point of it with their friends in town in less than a week got the first confirmed in his station  "I have been on board said he ever since and as  this way of life is become familiar to me have no cause to complain of my situationThe surgeon is a goodnatured indolent man the first mate who is now on shore on duty is indeed a little proud and cholerick as all Welchmen are but in the main a friendly honest fellowThe lieutenants I have no concern with and as for the captain he is too much of a gentleman to know a surgeon's mate even by sight"  CHAP XXV  The behaviour of Mr Morganhis pride displeasure and generositythe oeconomy of our mess describedThomson's further friendshipthe nature of my duty explainedthe situation of the sick  WHILE he was thus discoursing to me we heard a voice on the cockpit ladder pronounce with great vehemence in a strange dialect  "The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny if I go to him before there is something in my bellylet his nose be as yellow as a saffron or as plue as a pell look you or as green as a leek 'tis all one"  To this somebody answered  "So it seems my poor messmate must part his cable for want of a little assistanceHis foretopsail is loose already and besides the doctor ordered you to overhaul himbut I see you don't mind what your master says"  Here he  was interrupted with  "Splutter and vons you lousy tog who do you call my master get you gone to the doctor and tell him my birth and my education and my abilities and moreover my behaviour is as good as his or any gentleman's no disparagement to him in the whole worldGot pless my soul does he think or conceive or imagine that I am a horse or an ass or a goat to trudge backwards and forwards and upwards and downwards and by sea and by land at his will and pleasuresGo your ways you rapscallion and tell doctor Atkins that I desire and request that he will give a look upon the tying man and order something for him if he be dead or alive and I will see him take it by and by when my craving stomach is satisfied look you"  At this the other went away saying that if they would serve him so when he was a dying by Gd he'd be foul of them in the other worldHere Mr Thomson let me know that the person we heard was Mr Morgan the first mate who was just come on board from the hospital where he had been with sick peopleAt the same time I saw him come into the birthHe was a short thick man with a face garnished with pimples a snub nose turned up at the end an excessive wide mouth and little fiery eyes surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinklesMy friend immediately made him acquainted with my case when he regarded me with a very lofty look but without speaking set down a bundle he had in his hand and approached the cupboard which when he had opened he exclaimed in a great passion  "Cot is my life all the pork is gone as I am  a christian"  Thomson then gave him to understand that as I had been brought on board half famished he could do no less than entertain me with what was in the locker and the rather as he had bid the steward enter me in the messWhether this disappointment made Mr Morgan more peevish than usual or he really thought himself too little regarded by his fellowmate I know not but after some pause he went on in this manner  "Mr Thomson perhaps you do not use me with all the good manners and complaisance and respect look you that becomes you because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affairI have in my time look you been a man of some weight and substance and consideration and have kept house and home and paid scot and lot and the king's taxes ay and maintained a family to bootAnd moreover also I am your senior and your elder and your petter Mr Thomson"  "My elder I'll allow you to be but not my better cried Thomson with some heat"  "Cot is my saviour and witness too said Morgan with great vehemence that I am more elder and therefore more petter by many years than you"  Fearing this dispute might be attended with some bad consequence I interposed and told Mr Morgan I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference between him and the second mate and that rather than cause the least breach in their good understanding I would eat my allowance by myself or seek admission into some other companyBut Thomson with more spirit than discretion as I thought insisted upon my remaining where he had appointed  me and observed that no man possessed of generosity and compassion would have any objection to it considering my birth and talents and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergoneThis was touching Mr Morgan on the right key who protested with great earnestness that he had no objection to my being received in the mess but only complained that the ceremony of asking his consent was not observed  "As for a shentleman in distress said he shaking me by the hand I lofe him as I lofe my own powels For Got help me I have had vexations enough upon my own pack"  And as I afterwards learned in so saying he spoke no more than what was true for he had been once settled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire and was ruined by being security for an acquaintanceAll differences being composed he united his bundle which consisted of three bunches of onions and a great lump of Cheshirecheese wrapt up in a handkerchief and taking some biscuit from the cupboard fell to with a keen appetite inviting us to a share of the repastWhen he had fed heartily on this homely fare he filled a large cup made of a cocoanutshell with brandy and drinking it off told us  "Prandy was the best menstruum for onion and sheese"  His hunger being appeased he began to shew a great deal of good humour and being inquisitive about my birth no sooner understood that I was descended of a good family then he discovered a particular goodwill to me on that account deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons who was first the prisoner and afterwards the friend of Claudius Caesar  Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linnen he made me a present of two good ruffled shirts which with two of check Mr Thomson gave me enabled me to appear with decencyMean while the sailor whom Mr Morgan had sent to the doctor brought a prescription for his messmate which when Mr Welchman had read he got up to prepare it and asked if the man was "Tead or alive"  "Dead replied Jack if he was dead he would have no occasion for doctor's stuffNo thank God death has'n't as yet boarded him but they have been yard arm and yard arm these three glasses"  "Are his eyes open continued the mate"  "His starboard eye said the sailor is open but fast jamm'd in his head and the haulyards of his underjaw are given way"  "Passion of my heart cried Morgan the man is as pad as one would desire in a summer's dayDid you feel his pulses  To this the other replied with  "Anan"  Upon which this Cambro Briton with great earnestness and humanity ordered the tar to run to his messmate and keep him alive till he should come with the medicine  "and then said he you shall peradventure pehold what you shall see"  The poor fellow with great simplicity ran to the place where the sick man lay but in less than a minute returned with a woful countenance and told us his comrade had struck Morgan hearing this exclaimed  "Mercy upon my salfation why did you not stop him till I came"  "Stop him said the other I hailed him several times but he was too far on his way and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters so that he did not mind me"  "Well well said he we all owe heaven a TeathGo your ways you ragamuffin and take an example and a warning look you and repent of your misteets"  So saying he pushed the seamen out of the birth  While he entertained us with reflections suitable to this event we heard the boatswain pipe to dinner and immediately the boy belonging to our mess run to the locker from whence he carried off a large wooden platter and in a few minutes returned with it full of boiled peas crying  "Scaldings"  all the way as he cameThe cloath consisting of a piece of an old sail was instantly laid covered with three plates which by the colour I could with difficulty discern to be metal and as many spoons of the same composition two of which were curtailed in the handles and the other in the lip Mr Morgan himself enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter scooped from an old gallipot and a handful of onions shorn with some pounded pepperI was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish of which nevertheless my messmates eat heartily advising me to follow their example as it was banyan day and we could have no meat till next noonBut I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion and therefore desired to be excused expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan dayThey tole me that on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays the ship's company had no allowance of meat and that these meagre days were called banyan days the reason of which they did not know but I have since learned they take their denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of the East Indies who never taste flesh  After dinner Thomson led me round the ship' shewed me the different parts described their uses and as far as he could made me acquainted with the particulars of the discipline and oeconomy practised on boardHe then demanded of the boatswain an hammock for me which was slung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin and as I had no bedCloaths procured credit for me with the purser for a matrass and two blanketsAt seven aclock in the evening Morgan visited the sick and having ordered what was proper for each I assisted Thomson in making up his prescriptions But when I followed him with the medicines into the sick birth or hospital and observed the situation of the patients I was much less surprised to find people die on board than astonished to find any body recoverHere I saw about fifty miserable distempered wretches suspended in rows so huddled one upon another that not more than fourteen inches of space was allotted for each with his bed and bedding and deprived of the light of the day as well as of fresh air breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them and destitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition  CHAP XXVI  A disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my officeMorgan's nose is offendeda dialogue between him and the ship's stewardupon examination I find more causes of complaint than onemy hair is cut offMorgan's Cookerythe manner of sleeping on boardI am waked in the night by a dreadful noise  I Could not comprehend how it was possible for the attendants to come near those who hung on the inside towards the sides of the ship in order to assist them as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on the outside and entirely out of the reach of all visitationMuch less could I conjecture how my friend Thomson would be able to administer clysters that were ordered for some in that situationWhen I saw him thrust his wig in his pocket and strip himself to his waistcoat in a moment then creep on all fours under the hammocks of the sick and forcing up his bare pate between two kept them asunder with one shoulder until he had done his dutyEager to learn the service I desired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind he consenting I undressed myself after his example and crawling along the ship happened to roll which alarmed me  I laid hold of the first thing that came within my grasp with such violence that I overturned it and soon found by the smell that issued upon me I had not unlocked a box of the most delicious perfume it was well for me that my nostrils was none of the most delicate else I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour which diffused itself all over the ship to the utter discomposure of every body who tarried on the same deckneither was the consequence of this disgrace confined to my sense of smelling only for I felt my misfortune more ways than one That I might not however appear altogether disconcerted in this my  coup d'essai  I got up and pushing my head with great force between two hammocks towards the middle where the greatest resistance was I made an opening indeed but not understanding the knack of dexterously turning my shoulder to maintain my advantage I had the mortification to find myself stuck up as it were in a pillory and the weight of three or four people bearing on each side of my neck so that I was in danger of strangulationWhile I remained in this defenceless posture one of the sick men rendered peevish by his distemper was so enraged at the smell I had occasioned and the rude shock he had received from me in my elevation that with many bitter reproaches he seized me by the nose which he tweaked so unmercifully that I roared with anguish Thomson perceiving my condition ordered one of the waiters to my assistance who with much difficulty disengaged me from this embarras and hindered me from taking vengeance of the sick man whose indisposition would not  have screened him from the effects of my indignation  After having made an end of our ministry for that time we descended to the cockpit my friend comforting me for what had happened with a homely proverb which I do not chuse to repeatWhen we had got half way down the ladder Mr Morgan before he saw us having intelligence by his nose of the approach of something extraordinary cried  "Cot have mercy upon my senses I pelieve the enemy has poarded us in a stinkpot"  Then directing his discourse to the steward from whom he imagined the odour proceeded he reprimanded him severely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth threatned to smoak him like a padger with sulphur if ever he should presume to offend his neighbours with such smells for the future The steward conscious of his own innocence replied with some warmth  "I know of no smells but those of your own making"  This repartee introduced a smart dialogue in which the Welchman undertook to prove that though the stench he complained of did not flow from the steward's own body he was nevertheless the author of it by serving out damaged provisions to the ship's company and in particular putrified cheese from the use of which only he affirmed such unsavoury steams could ariseThen he launched cut into praises of good cheese of which he gave the analysis explained the different kinds of that commodity with the methods practised to make and preserve it and concluded with observing that in yielding good cheese the county of Glamorgan might vie with Cheshire itself and was much superior to it in the produce of goats and  putterI gathered from this conversation that if I went into the birth in my present pickle I should be no welcome guest and therefore desired Mr Thomson to go before and represent my calamity at which the first mate expressing some concern went upon deck immediately taking his way through the cable tire and by the main hatchway to avoid encountering with me desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible for he intended to regale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipeAccordingly I set about this disagreeable business and soon found I had more causes of complaint than I at first imagined For I perceived some guests had honoured me with their company whose visit I did not at all think seasonable neither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry being in possession of my chief quarters where they fed without reserve at the expence of my bloodBut considering it would be much easier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement than after they should be multiplied and naturalized to the soil I took the advice of my friend who to prevent such misfortunes went always closs shaved and made the boy of our mess cut off my hair which had been growing since I lest the service of Lavement The second mate lent me an old bob wig to supply the loss of that covering This affair being ended and every thing adjusted in the best manner my circumstances would permit the descendant of Caractacus returned and ordering the boy to bring a piece of salt beef from the brine cut off a slice and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions which seasoning with a moderate proportion of pepper and salt he brought it into a consistence  with oil and vinegarThen tasting the dish assured us it was the best salmagundie that ever he made and recommended it to our palate with such heartiness that I could not help doing honour to his preparation But I had no sooner swallowed a mouthful than I thought my entrails were scorched and endeavoured with a deluge of small beer to allay the heat it occasionedSupper being over Mr Morgan having smoaked a couple of pipes and supplied the moisture he had expended with as many cans of flip of which we all partook a certain yawning began to admonish me that it was high time to repair by sleep the injury I had suffered from want of rest the preceeding night which being perceived by my companions whose time of repose was by this time arrived they proposed we should turn in or in other words go to bed Our hammocks which hung parallel to one another on the outside of our birth were immediately unlashed and I beheld each of my messmates spring with great agility into his respective nest where they seemed to lie concealed very much at their easeBut it was some time before I could prevail upon myself to trust my carcase at such a distance from the ground in a narrow bag out of which I imagined I should be apt on the least motion in my sleep to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones I suffered myself however to be persuaded and taking a leap to get in threw myself quite over with such violence that had I not luckily got hold of Thomson's hammock I should have pitched upon my head on the other side and in all likelihood fractured my scullAfter some fruitless efforts I succeeded at last but the apprehension of the  jeopardy in which I believed myself withstood all the attacks of sleep till towards the morningwatch when in spite of my fears I was overpowered with slumber tho' I did not long enjoy this comfortable situation being arroused with a noise so loud and shrill that I thought the drums of my ears were burst by it this was followed by a dreadful summons pronounced by a hoarse voice which I could not understand While I was debating with myself whether or not I should wake my companion and enquire into the occasion of this disturbance I was informed by one of the quartermasters who passed by me with a lanthorn in his hand that the noise which alarmed me was occasioned by the boatswain's mates who called up the larboard watch and that I must lay my account with such interruption every morning at the same hourBeing now more assured of of my safety I addressed myself again to rest and slept till eight aclock when getting up and breakfasting with my comrades on biscuit and brandy the sick were visited and assisted as before after which my good friend Thomson explained and performed another piece of duty to which I was a strangerAt a certain hour in the morning the boy of the mess went round all the decks ringing a small handbell and in rhimes composed for the occasion inviting all those who had sores to repair before the mast where one of the doctor's mates attended with applications to dress them  CHAP XXVII  I acquire the friendship of the surgeon who procures a warrant for me and makes me a present of cloathsa battle between a midshipman and methe surgeon leaves the shipthe captain comes on board with another surgeona dialogue between the captain and Morganthe sick are ordered to be brought upon the quarterdeck and examinedthe consequences of that ordera madman accuses Morgan and is set at liberty by command of the captain whom he instantly attacks and pummels without mercy  WHILE I was busied with my friend in this practice the doctor chanced to pass by the place where we were and stopping to observe me appeared very well satisfied with my method of application and afterwards sent for me to his cabbin where having examined me touching my skill in surgery and the particulars of my fortune interested himself so far in my behalf as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me seeing I had been already found qualified at Surgeon's hall for the station I now filled on board and this he the more cordially engaged in when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowlin  for whom he expressed a  particular regardIn the mean time I could learn from his discourse that he did not intend to go to sea again with captain Oakhum having as he thought been indifferently used by him during the last voyage  While I lived tollerably easy in expectation of preferment I was not altogether without mortifications which I not only suffered from the rude insults of the sailors and petty officers among whom I was known by the name of  Loblolly Boy  but also from the disposition of Morgan who though friendly in the main was often very troublesome with his pride which expected a good deal of submission from me and delighted in recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands  About six weeks after my arrival on board the surgeon bidding me follow him into his cabbin presented a warrant to me by which I was appointed surgeon's third mate on board the ThunderThis he had procured by his interest at the Navyoffice as also another for himself by virtue of which he was removed into a second rate I acknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could suggest and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing such a valuable friend to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further by my respectful and diligent behaviourBut his generosity rested not herefor before he left the ship he made me a present of a chest and some cloaths that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised meI found my spirit revive with my good fortune and now I was an officer resolved to maintain the dignity of my station against all opposition or affronts nor was it long before I  had occasion to exert my resolution my old enemy the midshipman whose name was Crampley entertaining an implacable animosity against me for the disgrace he had suffered on my account had since that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me when I was not intitled to retort his bad usageAnd even after I had been rated on the books and mustered as surgeon's mate did not think fit to restrain his insolenceIn particular being one day present while I dressed a wound in a sailor's leg he began to sing a song which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country and therefore signified my resentment by observing that the Scots always laid their account in finding enemies among the ignorant insignificant and maliciousThis unexpected piece of assurance enraged him to such a degree that he lent me a blow on the face which I verily thought had demolished my cheekbone I was not slow in returning the obligation and the affair began to be very serious when by accident Mr Morgan and one of the master's mates coming that way interposed and inquiring into the cause endeavoured to promote a reconciliation but finding us both exasperated to the uttermost and bent against accommodation they advised us either to leave our difference undecided till we should have an opportunity of terminating it on shore like gentlemen or else chuse a proper place on board and bring it to an issue by boxing This last expedient was greedily embraced and being forthwith conducted to the ground proposed we stript in a moment and began a very furious contest in which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist not so much in strength and agility as in skill which he had acquired in the  school at Hockley in the Hole and TottenhamCourtMany crossbuttocks did I sustain and pegs on the stomach without number till at last my breath being quite gone as well as my vigour wasted I grew desperate and collecting all my spirits in one effort threw in at once head hands and feet with such violence that I drove my antagonist three paces backward into the main hatchway down which he fell and pitching upon his head and right shoulder remained without sense and motionMorgan looking down and seeing him lie in that condition cried  "Upon my conscience as I am a Christian sinner look you I believe his pattles are all ofer but I take you all to witness that there was no treachery in the case and that he has suffered by the chance of war"  So saying he descended to the deck below to examine into the situation of my adversary and left me very little pleased with my victory as I found myself not only terribly bruised but likewise in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley But this fear vanished when my fellowmate having by bleeding him in the juglar brought him to himself and assured himself of the state of his body called up to me to be under no concern for the midshipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the  os humeri  as one would desire to see on a summer's dayUpon this information I crawled down to the cockpit and acquainted Thomson with the affair who providing himself with bandages c necessary for the occasion went up to assist Mr Morgan in the reduction of the dislocationWhen this was successfully performed they wished me joy of the event of the combat and the  Welchman after observing that in all likelihood the ancient Scots and Britons were the same people bid me  "Praise Cot for putting mettle in my pelly and strength in my limbs to support it"  I acquired such reputation by this recounter which lasted twenty minutes that every body became more cautious of his behaviour towards me though Crampley with his arm in a sling talked very high and threatened to seize the first opportunity of retrieving on shore the honour he had lost by an accident from which I could justly claim no merit  About this time captain Oakhum having received sailing orders came on board and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country who soon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of doctor Atkins being grossly ignorant and intolerably assuming false vindictive and unforgiving a merciless tyrant to his inferiors an abject sycophant to those above him In the morning after the captain came on board our first mate according to custom went to wait on him with a sick list which when this grim commander had perused he cried with a stern countenance  "Blood and oons sixtyone sick people on board of my shipHarkee you sir I'll have no sick in my ship by Gd"  The Welchman replied he should be very glad to find no sick people on board but while it was otherwise he did no more than his duty in presenting him with a list  "You and your list may be dn'd said the captain throwing it at him I say there shall be no sick in this ship while I have the command of her"  Mr Morgan being nettled at this treatment told him his indignation ought to be directed  to Got Almighty who visited his people with distempers and not to him who contributed all in his power towards their cure The Bashaw not being used to such behaviour in any of his officers was enraged to fury at this satirical insinuation and stamping with his foot called him insolent scoundrel threatning to have him pinioned to the deck if he should presume to utter another syllable But the blood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated disdained to be restricted by such a command and began to manifest itself in  "Captain Oakoum I am a shentleman of birth and parentage look you and peradventure I am moreover"  Here his harrangue was broke off by the captain's steward who being Morgan's countryman hurried him out of the cabbin before he had time to exasperate his master to a greater degree which would certainly have been the case for the indignant Welchman could hardly be hindered by his friend's arguments and intreaties from reentering the presence chamber and defying captain Oakhum to his teethHe was however appeased at length and came down to the birth where finding Thomson and me at work preparing medicines he bid us leave off our lapour and go to play for the captain by his sole word and power and command had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil and there was no more malady on poard So saying he drank off a gill of brandy sighed grievously three times poured forth an ejaculation of  "Got pless my heart liver and lungs"  and then began to sing a Welch song with great earnestness of visage voice and gestureI could not conceive the meaning of this singular phaenomenon and saw by the looks of Thomson who at the same time shook his head that he  suspected poor Cadwallader's brains were unsettled He perceiving our amazement told us he would explain the mystery but at the same time bid us take notice that he had lived poy patchelor married man and widower almost forty years and in all that time there was no man nor mother's son in the whole world who durst use him so ill as captain Oakhum had done Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them as I have already related it and had no sooner finished this narration than he received a message from the surgeon to bring the sicklist to the quarterdeck for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewedThis inhuman order shocked us extremely as we knew it would be impossible to carry some of them on the deck without imminent danger of their lives but as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for us to remonstrate against it we repaired to the quarterdeck in a body to see this extraordinary muster Morgan observing by the way that the captain was going to send to the other world a great many evidences to testify against himselfWhen we appeared upon deck the captain bid the doctor who stood bowing at his right hand look at these lazy lubberly sons of bitches who were good for nothing on board but to eat the king's provision and encourage idleness in the skulkersThe surgeon grinned approbation and taking the list began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointedThe first who came under his cognizance was a poor fellow just freed of a fever which had weakened him so much that he could hardly standMr Mackshane for that was the doctor's name  having felt his pulse protested he was as well as any man in the world and the captain delivered him over to the boatswain's mate with orders that he should receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately for counterfeiting himself sick when he was notbut before the discipline could be executed the man dropt down on the deck and had well nigh perished under the hands of the executionerThe next patient to be considered laboured under a quartan ague and being then in his interval of health discovered no other symptoms of distemper than a pale meagre countenance and emaciated body upon which he was declared fit for duty and turned over to the boatswainbut being resolved to disgrace the doctor died upon the forecastle next day during his cold fitThe third complained of a pleuretic stitch and spitting of blood for which doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at the pump to promote expectoration but whether this was improper for one in his situation or that it was used to excess I know not but in less than half an hour he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that issued from his lungsA fourth with much difficulty climbed to the quarterdeck being loaded with a monstrous ascites or dropsy that invaded his chest so much he could scarce fetch his breath but his disease being interpreted into fat occasioned by idleness and excess of eating he was ordered with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge his chest to go aloft immediately It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch to alledge his utter incapacity the boatswain's driver was commanded to whip him up with a cat and nine tails The smart of this application made him exert himself so much that  he actually arrived at the foothookshrouds but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing else to support it than his weakened arms either out of spite or necessity he quitted his hold and plumped into the sea where he must have been drowned had not a sailor who was in a boat alongside saved his life by keeping him afloat till he was hoisted on board by a tackleIt would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every miserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the captain and surgeon who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their fellowcreatures Many were brought up in the height of fevers and rendered delirious by the injuries they suffered in the waySome gave up the ghost in the presence of their inspectors and others who were ordered to their duty languished a few days at work among their fellows and then departed without any ceremonyOn the whole the number of sick was reduced to less than a dozen and the authors of this reduction were applauding themselves for the service they had done to their king and country when the boatswain's mate informed his honour that there was a man below lashed to his hammock by the direction of the doctor's mate and that he begged hard to be released affirming he had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr Morgan bore to him and that he was as much in his senses as any man aboardThe captain hearing this darted a severe look at the Welchman and ordered the man to be brought up immediately Upon which Morgan protested with great fervency that the person in question was as mad as a Marchhare and begged for the the love of Got they would at least keep his  arms pinioned during his examination to prevent him from doing mischiefThis request the commander granted for his own sake and the patient was produced who insisted upon his being in his right wits with such calmness and strength of argument that every body present was inclined to believe him except Morgan who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behaviour two days before that he had actually unbound him with his own hands and had well nigh been murdered for his pains this was confirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters who declared he had pulled this patient from the doctor's mate whom he had gotten down and almost strangledTo this the man answered that the witness was a creature of Morgan's and was suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the mate whom the defendant had affronted by discovering to the people on board that Mr Morgan's wife kept a ginshop in RagFairThis anecdote produced a laugh at the expence of the Welchman who shaking his head with some emotion said  "Ay ay 'tis no matterGot knows 'tis an arrant falshood"  Captain Oakhum without any further hesitation ordered the fellow to be unfettered at the same time threatening to make Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite but the Briton no sooner heard the decision in favour of the madman than he got up the mizzenshrouds crying to Thomson and me to get out of his reach for we should see him play the tevil with a vengeance We did not think fit to disregard this caution and accordingly got up on the poop whence we beheld the maniac as soon as he was released fly at the  captain like a fury crying  "I'll let you know you scoundrel that I am commander of this vessel"  and pummel him without mercy The surgeon who went to the assistance of his patron shared the same fate and it was with the utmost difficulty that he was mastered at last after having done great execution among those who opposed him  CHAP XXVIII  The captain enraged threatens to put the madman to death with his own handis diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion of the first lieutenant and surgeonwe set sail for St Helens join the fleet under the command of Sir Cnr Ole and proceed for the WestIndiesare overtaken by a terrible tempestmy friend Jack Rattlin has his leg broke by a fall from the mainyardthe behaviour of doctor MackshaneJack opposes the amputation of his limb in which he is seconded by Morgan and me who undertake the cure and perform it successfully  THE captain was carried into his cabbin so enraged with the treatment he had received that he ordered the sellow to be brought before him that he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand and would certainly  have satisfied his revenge in this manner had not the first lieutenant remonstrated against it by observing that in all appearance the fellow was not mad but desperate that he had been hired by some enemy of the captain to assassinate him and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a courtmartial which no doubt would sift the affair to the bottom by which important discoveries might be made and then sentence the criminal to a death adequate to his demeritsThis suggestion improbable as it was had the desired effect upon the captain being exactly calculated for the meridian of his intellects more especially as doctor Mackshane espoused this opinion in consequence of his previous declaration that the man was not madMorgan finding there was no more damage done could not help discovering by his countenance the pleasure he enjoyed on this occasion and while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation ventured to ask him Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board But he would have been wiser in containing this sally which his patient carefully laid up in his memory to be taken notice of at a more fit seasonMean while we weighed anchor and on our way to the Downs the madman who was treated as a prisoner took an opportunity while the centinel attended him at the head to leap overboard and frustrate the revenge of the captainWe staid not long at the downs but took the benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead where having received on board provisions for six months we sailed from St Helens in the grand fleet bound  for the WestIndies on the ever memorable expedition of Carthagena  It was not without great mortification I saw myself on the point of being transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate destitute of every convenience that could render such a voyage supportable and under the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant whose command was almost intolerable However as these complaints were common to a great many on board I resolved to submit patiently to my fate and contrive to make myself as easy as the nature of the case would allowWe got out of the channel with a prosperous breeze which died away leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard But this state of inaction did not last long for next night our maintopsail was split by the wind which in the morning encreased to a hurricaneI was wakened by a most horrible din occasioned by the play of the gun carriages upon the decks above the creaking of cabins the howling of the wind through the shrouds the confused noise of the ship's crew the pipes of the boatswain and his mates the trumpets of the lieutenants and the clanking of the chainpumpsMorgan who had never been at sea before turned out in a great hurry crying  "Got have mercy and compassion upon us I believe we have got upon the confines of Lucifer and the dned"  while poor Thomson lay quaking in his hammock putting up petitions to heaven for our safetyI got out of bed and joined the Welchman with whom after having fortified ourselves with brandy I went above but if my sense of hearing was startled before how must my sight be appalled in beholding the  effects of the storm The sea was swelled into billows mountainhigh on the top of which our ship sometimes hung as if it was about to be precipitated to the abyss below Sometimes we sunk between two waves that rose on each side higher than our topmast head and threatned by dashing together to overwhelm us in a moment Of all our fleet consisting of a hundred and fifty sail scarce twelve appeared and these driving under their bare poles at the mercy of the tempest At length the masts of one of them gave way and tumbled overboard with a hideous crash Nor was the prospect in our own ship much more agreeablea number of officers and sailors run backward and forward with distraction in their looks hollowing to one another and unknowing what they should attend to first Some clung to the yards endeavouring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces flapping in the wind others tried to furl those which were yet whole while the masts at every pitch bent and quivered like twigs as if they would have shivered into innumerable splintersWhile I considered this scene with equal terror and astonishment one of the mainbraces broke by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard's arm into the sea where they perished and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck at the expence of a broken leg Morgan and I ran immediately to his assistance and found a splinter of the shinbone thrust by the violence of the fall through the skin As this was a case of too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident as well as to bring up dressings which  we always kept ready preparedI entered his apartment without any ceremony and by the glimmering of a lamp perceived him on his knees before something that very much resembled a crucifix but this I will not insist upon that I may not seem too much a slave to common report which indeed assisted my conjecture on this occasion by representing doctor Mackshane as a member of the church of RomeBe this as it will he got up in a sort of confusion occasioned I suppose by his being disturbed in his devotion and in a trice snatched the object of my suspicion from my sightAfter making an apology for my intrusion I acquainted him with the situation of Rattlin but could by no means prevail upon him to visit him on deck where he lay he bid me desire the boatswain to order some of the men to carry him down to the cockpit and in the mean time he would direct Thomson in getting ready the dressingsWhen I signified to the boatswain the doctor's desire he swore a terrible oath that he could not spare one man from the deck because he expected the masts would go by the board every minuteThis piece of information did not at all contribute to my peace of mind however as my friend Rattlin complained very much with the assistance of Morgan I supported him to the lower deck whither Mr Mackshane after much intreaty ventured to come attended by Thomson with a boxful of dressings and his own servant who carried a whole set of capital instrumentsHe examined the fracture and the wound and concluding from a livid colour extending itself upon the limb that a mortification would ensue resolved to amputate the leg immediatelyThis was a dreadful sentence  to the patient who recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco pronounced with a woful countenance  "What is there no remedy doctor must I be dock'd can't you splice it"  "Assuredly doctor Mackshane said the first mate with submission and deference and veneration to your superior abilities and opportunities and stations look you I do apprehend and conjecture and aver that there is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this poor man's leg"  "God almighty bless you dear Welchman cried Rattlin may you have fair wind and weather wheresoever you're bound and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at last"  Mackshane very much incensed at his mate's differing in opinion from him so openly answered that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him and in a peremptory tone ordered him to apply the tourniquetAt the sight of which Jack starting up cried  "Avast avast dn my heart if you clap your nippers on me till I know whereforeMr Random won't you lend a hand towards saving of my precious limb Odd's heart if lieutenant Bowling was here he would not suffer Jack Rattlin's leg to be be chopped off like a piece of old junk"  This pathetic address to me joined to my inclination to serve my honest friend and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying the amputation induced me to declare myself of the first mate's opinion and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin was owing to an inflammation occasioned by a contusion and common in all such cases without any indication of an approaching gangrene Morgan who had a  great opinion of my skill manifestly exulted in my fellowship and asked Thomson's sentiments of the matter in hopes of strengthening our association with him too but he being of a meek disposition and either dreading the enmity of the surgeon or speaking the dictates of his own judgment in a modest manner espoused the opinion of Mackshane who by this time having consulted with himself determined to act in such a manner as to screen himself from censure and at the same time revenge himself on us for our arrogance in contradicting himWith this view he demanded to know if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril that is be answerable for the consequenceTo this Morgan replied that the lives of his creatures are in the hands of Got alone and it would be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in the power of his maker no more than the doctor could promise to cure all the sick to whom he administered his assistance but if the patient would put himself under our direction we would do our endeavour to bring his distemper to a savourable issue to which at present we saw no obstructionI signified my concurrence and Rattlin was so overjoyed that shaking us both by the hands he swore no body else should touch him and if he died his blood should be upon his own headMr Mackshane flattering himself with the prospect of our miscarriage went away and left us to manage it as we should think proper accordingly having sawed off part of the splinter that stuck through the skin we reduced the fracture dressed the wound applied the eighteentailed bandage and put the leg in a box  secundum artem  Every thing succeeded according  to our wish and we had the satisfaction of not only preserving the poor fellow's leg but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship's company who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure which was compleated in six weeks  CHAP XXIX  Mackshane's maliceI am taken up and imprisoned for a spyMorgan meets with the same fateThomson is tempered with to turn evidence against usdisdains the proposal and is maltreated for his integrityMorgan is released to assist the surgeon during an engagement with some French ships of warI remain fettered on the poop exposed to the enemy's shot and grow delirious with fearam comforted after the battle by Morgan who speaks freely of the captain is overheard by the centinel who informs against him and again imprisonedThomson grows desperate and notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me goes overboard in the night  IN the mean time the storm subsided into a brisk gale that carried us into the warm latitudes where the weather became intolerable and the crew very sicklyThe doctor left nothing  unattempted towards the completion of his vengeance against the Welchman and me He went among the sick under pretence of enquiring into their grievances with a view of picking up complaints to our prejudice but finding himself frustrated in that expectation by the goodwill we had procured from the patients by our diligence and humanity he took the resolution of listening to our conversation by hiding himself behind the canvas that surrounded our birth here too he was detected by the boy of our mess who acquainted us with this piece of behaviour and one night while we were picking a large bone of saltbeef Morgan discerned something stir against our hangings which immediately interpreting to be the doctor he tipt me the wink and pointed to the place where I could evidently perceive some body standing upon which I snatched up the bone and levelled it with all my force at him saying  "Whoever you are take that for your curiosity"  It had the desired effect for we heard the listener tumble down and afterwards crawl to his own cabbinI applauded myself much for this feat which turned out one of the most unlucky exploits of my life Mackshane from that night marking me out for destructionAbout a week thereafter as I was going my rounds among the sick I was taken prisoner and carried to the poop by the master at arms where I was loaded with irons and stapled to the deck on pretence that I was a spy on board and had conspired against the captain's lifeHow ridiculous soever this imputation was I did not fail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shewn to the worst of criminals being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching  heat of the sun by day and the unwholesome damps by night during the space of twelve days in which time I was neither brought to trial nor examined touching the probability of my chargeI had no sooner recovered the use of my reflection which had been quite overthrown by this accident than I sent for Thomson who after condoling with me on the occasion hinted to me that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the doctor who had given in an information against me to the captain in consequence of which I was arrested and all my papers seizedWhile I was cursing my capricious fate I saw Morgan ascend the poop guarded by two corporals who made him sit down by me that he might be pinioned in the same machineNotwithstanding my situation I could scarce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner who without speaking one word allowed his seet to be inclosed in the rings provided for that purpose but when they pretended to fasten him on his back he grew outragious and drawing a large cuteau from his sidepocket threatened to rip up the belly of the first man who should approach him in order to treat him in such an unworthy mannerThey were preparing to use him very roughly when the lieutenant on the quarterdeck called up to them to let him remain as he wasHe then crept towards me and taking me by the hand bid me  "put my trust in Got"  And looking at Thomson who sat by us trembling with a pale visage told him there were two more rings for his feet and he should be glad to find him in such good companyBut it was not the intention of our adversary to include the second mate in our fate Him he excepted  to be his drudge in attending the sick and if possible his evidence against us With this view he sounded him afar off but finding his integrity incorruptible he harrassed him so much out of spite that in a short time this mild creature grew weary of his life  While I and my fellowprisoner comforted each other in our tribulation the admiral discovered four sail of ships to leeward and made signal for our ship and four more to chace Hereupon every thing was cleared for an engagement and Mackshane foreseeing he would have occasion for more assistants than one obtained Morgan's liberty while I was left in this deplorable posture to the chance of battleIt was almost dark when we came up with the sternmost chace which we hailed and enquired who they were they gave us to understand they were French men of war upon which captain Oakhum commanded them to send their boat on board of him but they refused telling him if he had any business with them to come on board of their ship He then threatned to pour in a broadside upon them which they promised to returnBoth sides were as good as their word and the engagement began with great furyThe reader may guess how I passed my time lying in this helpless situation amidst the terrors of a seafight expecting every moment to be cut asunder or dashed in pieces by the enemy's shot I endeavoured to compose myself as much as possible by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those who were stationed about me but when I beheld them employed without intermission in annoying the foe and encouraged by the society and behaviour of one another I  could easily perceive a wide difference between their condition and mine However I concealed my agitation as well as I could till the head of the officer of Marines who stood near me being shot off bounced from the deck athwart my face leaving me wellnigh blinded with brainsI could contain myself no longer but began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs when a drummer coming towards me asked if I was wounded and before I could answer received a great shot in his belly which tore out his intrails and he fell flat on my breastThis accident entirely bereft me of all discretion I redoubled my cries which were drowned in the noise of the battle and finding myself disregarded lost all patience and became frantick vented my rage in oaths and execrations till my spirits being quite exhausted I remained quiet and insensible of the load that oppressed meThe engagement lasted till broad day when captain Oakhum finding he was like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair pretended to be undeceived by seeing their colours and hailing the ship with whom he had fought all night protested he believed them Spaniards and the guns being silenced on each side ordered the barge to be hoisted out and went on board of the French commodoreOur loss amounted to ten killed and eighteen wounded most part of whom afterwards diedMy fellowmates had no sooner dispatched their business in the cockpit than full of friendly concern they came to visit meMorgan ascending first and seeing my face almost covered with brains and blood concluded I was no longer a man for this world and calling to Thomson with great emotion bid him  come up and take his last farewel of his comrade and countryman who was posting to a petter place where there were no Mackshanes nor Oakhums to asperse and torment him  "No said he taking me by the hand you are going to a country where there is more respect shewn to unfortunate shentlemen and where you will have the satisfaction of peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning primstone"  Thomson alarmed at this apostrophe made haste to the place where I lay and sitting down by me with tears in his eyes enquired into the nature of my calamityBy this time I had recollected myself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends whom to their great satisfaction I immediately undeceived with regard to their apprehension of my being mortally woundedAfter I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed and partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them we entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained and spoke very freely of the authors of our misery which being overheard by the centinel who guarded me he was no sooner relieved than he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation according to the orders he had received The effects of this soon appeared in the arrival of the master at arms who replaced Morgan in his former station and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict guard over his tongue if he did not chuse to accompany us in our confinementThomson foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending and dressing the sick and wounded must now fall upon his shoulders as well as the ill usage of Mackshane grew desperate at the prospect  and though I never heard him swear before imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his oppressors declaring that he would rather quit life altogether than be much longer under the power of such barbariansI was not a little startled at his vivacity and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints by representing the subject of my own with as much aggravation as it would bear by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune lay on my side and take an example from me of fortitude and submission till such time as we could procure redress which I hoped was not far off considering that we should probably be in a harbour in less than three days where we should have an opportunity of preferring our complaints to the admiralThe Welchman joined in my remonstrances and was at great pains to demonstrate that it was every man's duty as well as interest to resign himself to the divine will and look upon himself as a centinel upon duty who is by no means at liberty to leave his post before he is relievedThomson listened attentively to what we said and at last shedding a flood of tears shook his head and left us without making any replyAbout eleven at night he came to see us again with a settled gloom on his countenance and gave us to understand that he had undergone excessive toil since he saw us and in recompence had been grosly abused by the doctor who taxed him with being confederate with us in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain After some time spent in mutual exhortation he got up and squeezing me by the hand with an uncommon fervour cried  "God bless you both"  and left us to wonder at his  singular manner of parting with us which did not fail to make an impression on us both  Next morning when the hour of visitation  ame round this unhappy young man was a missing and after strick search supposed to have gone overboard in the night which was certainly the case  CHAP XXX  We lament over the fate of our companionthe captain offers Morgan his liberty which he refuses to acceptwe are brought before him and examinedMorgan is sent back to custody whither also I am remanded after a curious trial  THE news of this event affected my fellowprisoner and me extremely as our unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition the love and esteem of us both and the more we regretted his untimely fate the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occasion of itThis abandoned miscreant did not discover the least symptom of concern for Thomson's death although he must be conscious to himself of having driven him by ill usage to that fatal resolution but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients Accordingly one of the corporals was sent up to unfetter him when he protested he would not be released until he should know for what he was confined nor  would he be a tennisball nor a shittlecock nor a trudge nor a scullion to any captain under the sunOakhum finding him obstinate and fearing it would not be in his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity was willing to shew some appearance of justice and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him on the quarterdeck where he sat in state with his clerk on one side and his counsellor Mackshane on the otherWhen we approached he honoured us with this salutation  "So gentlemen dn my blood many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tucked up to the yard's arm without either judge or jury for the crimes you have been guilty of but dn my blood I have too much good nature in allowing such dogs as you to make your defence"  "Captain Oaghum said my fellowsufferer certainly it is in your power Got help the while to tuck us all up at your will and desire and pleasuresAnd perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up than undergo the miseries to which we have been exposedSo may the farmer hang his kids for his diversion and amusement and mirth but there is such a thing as justice if not upon earth surely in heaven that will punish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonness and parparity look youIn the mean time I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge and see the person who accuses me"  "That you shall said the captain here doctor what have you to say"  Mackshane stepping forward hemmed a good while in order to clear his  throat and before he began Morgan accosted him thus  "Doctor Mackshane look in my facelook in the face of an honest man who abhorrs a falsewitness as he abhorrs the tevil and Got be judge between you and me"  The doctor not minding this conjuration made the following speech as near as I can remember  "I'll tell you what Mr Morgan to be sure what you say is just in regard to an honest man and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man then it is my opinion that you deserve to be acquitted in relation to that there affair for I tell you what captain Oakhum is resolved for to do every body justiceAs for my own part all that I have to alledge is that I have been informed you have spoken disrespectful words against your captain who to be sure is the most honourable and generous commander in the king's service without asparagement or acceptation of man woman or child"  Having uttered this elegant harrangue on which he seemed to plume himself Morgan replied  "I do partly guess and conceive and understand your meaning which I wish could be more explicite But however I do suppose I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay or if I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of captain Oakhum I hope there is no treason in my words"  "But there's mutiny by Gd and that's death by the articles of war cried OakhumIn the mean time let the witnesses be called"  Hereupon Mackshane's servant appeared and the boy of our mess whom they had seduced and tutored for the purposeThe first declared that Morgan as he descended the cockpit ladder  one day cursed the captain and called him a savage beast saying he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind  "This said the clerk is a strong presumption of a design formed against the captain's lifeFor why It presupposes malice aforethought and a criminal intention  a priori  "  "Right said the captain to this miserable grub who had been an attorney's boy you shall have law enough here's Cook and Littlejohn for it"  This evidence was confirmed by the boy who affirmed he heard the first mate say that the captain had no more bowels than a bear and the surgeon had no more brains than an assThen the centinel who heard our discourse on the poop was examined and informed the court that the Welchman assured me that captain Oakhum and doctor Mackshane would toss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarityThe clerk observed that here was an evident prejudication which confirmed the former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of captain Oakhum for because how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain and surgeon would be damned unless he had intention to make away with them before they could have time to repentThis sage explanation had great weight with our noble commander who exclaimed  "What have you to say to this Taffy you seem to be taken all aback brother hah"  Morgan was too much of a gentleman to disown the text although he absolutely denied the truth of the comment Upon which the captain strutting up to him with a ferocious countenance said  "So Mr Sonofabch you confess you honoured me with the names of bear and  beast and pronounced my damnation Dn my heart I have a good mind to have you brought to a courtmartial and hanged you dog"  Here Mackshane having occasion for an assistant interposed and begged the captain to pardon Mr Morgan with his wonted goodness upon condition that he the delinquent should make such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demandedUpon which the CambroBriton who on this occasion would have made no submission to the Great Mogul surrounded with his guards thanked the doctor for his mediation and acknowledged himself in the wrong for having called the image of Got a beast  "but said he I spoke by metaphor and parable and comparison and types as we signify meekness by a lamb letchery by a goat and craftiness by a fox so we liken ignorance to an ass and brutality to a bear and fury to a tygertherefore I made these similies to express my sentiments look you and what I said before Got I will not unsay before man nor peast neither"  Oakhum was so provoked at this insolence as he termed it that he ordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement and his clerk to proceed in the examination of meThe first question put to me was touching the place of my nativity which I declared to be the north of Scotland  "The north of Ireland more liker cried the captain but we shall bring you up presently"  He then asked what religion I professed and when I answered  "The protestant"  swore I was as arrant a Roman as ever went to mass  "Come come clerk continued he catechise him a little on this subject"  But before I relate the particulars of the clerk's enquiries it will  not be amiss to inform the reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian and if not shrewdly belied a Roman Catholick to boot  "You say you are a protestant said the clerk make the sign of the cross with your fingers so and swear upon it to that affirmation"  When I was about to perform this ceremony the captain cried with some emotion  "No no damme I'll have no profanation neitherBut go on with your interrogations"  "Well then proceeded my examiner how many sacraments are there"  To which I replied  "Two"  "What are they said he"  I answered  "Baptism and the Lord's Supper"  "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether said Oakhum I thought this fellow was a rank Roman"  The clerk though he was bred under an attorney could not relrain from blushing at this blunder which he endeavoured to conceal by observing that these decoys would not do with me who seemed to be an old offenderHe went on with asking if I believed in transubstantiation but I treated the notion of the real presence with such disrespect that his patron was scandalized at my impiety and commanded him to proceed to the plotWhereupon this miserable pettifogger told me there was great reason to suspect me of being a spy on board and that I had entered into a conspiracy with Thomson and others not yet detected against the life of captain OakhumTo support which accusation they adduced the testimony of our boy who declared he had often heard the deceased Thomson and me whispering together and could distinguish the words  "Oakhum rascal poison pistol"  by which it appeared we did intend  to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction That the death of Thomson seemed to confirm this conjecture who either feeling the stings of remorse for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy or fearing a discovery by which he must have infallibly suffered an ignominious death had put a fatal period to his own existenceBut what established the truth of the whole was a book in cypher found among my papers which exactly tallied with one found in his chest after his disappearance This he observed was a presumption very near proof positive and would determine any jury in christendom to find me guiltyIn my own defence I alledged that I had been dragged on board at first very much against my inclination as I could prove by the evidence of some people now in the ship consequently could have no design of becoming spy at that time and ever since had been entirely out of the reach of any correspondence that could justly intail that suspicion upon meand as for conspiring against my captain's life it could not be supposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the least thought of such an undertaking which he could not possibly perform without certain infamy and ruin to himself even if he had all the inclination in the worldThat allowing the boy's evidence to be true which I affirmed was false and malicious nothing conclusive could be gathered from a few incoherent words Neither was the fate of Mr Thomson a circumstance more favourable for the charge for I had in my pocket a letter which too well explained that mystery in a very different manner from that which was supposed With these words I produced the following letter which Jack Rattlin brought to me the  very day after Thomson disappeared and told me it was committed to his care by the deceased who made him promise not to deliver it sooner The clerk taking it out of my hand read aloud the contents which were these  DEAR FRIEND  I AM so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and nightly undergo and the barbarous usage of doctor Mackshane who is bent on your destruction as well as mine that I am resolved to free myself from this miserable life and before you receive this shall be no more I could have wished to die in your good opinion which I am afraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life but if you cannot acquit me I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory of an unfortunate young man who loved youI recommend it to you to beware of Mackshane whose revenge is implacableI wish all prosperity to you and Mr Morgan to whom pray offer my last respects and beg to be remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman  WILLIAM THOMSON  This letter was no sooner read than Mackshane in a transport of rage snatched it out of the clerk's hands and tore it into a thousand pieces saying it was a villainous forgery contrived and executed by myselfThe captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion  notwithstanding I insisted on having the remains of it compared to other writings of Thomson which they had in possession and I was ordered to answer the last article of my accusation namely the book of cyphers found among my papers  "That is easily done said I What you are pleased to call cyphers are no other than the Greek characters in which for my amusement I kept a diary of every thing remarkable that has occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage till the day on which I was put in irons and the same method was practised by Mr Thomson who copied mine"  "A very likely story cried Mackshane what occasion was there for using Greek characters if you were not afraid of discovering what you had wrotebut what d'ye talk of Greek charactersD'ye think I am so ignorant of the Greek language as not to distinguish its letters from these which are no more Greek than Chinese No no I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you nor none that ever came from your country"  So saying with an unparalleled effronterie he repeated some gibberish which by the sound seemed to be Irish and made it pass for Greek with the captain who looking at me with a contemptible sneer exclaimed  "Ah ha have you caught a tartar"  I could not help smiling at the consummate assurance of this Hibernian and offered to refer the dispute to any body on board who understood the Greek alphabet Upon which Morgan was brought back and being made acquainted with the affair took the book and read a whole page in English without hesitation deciding the controversy in my  favourThe doctor was so far from being out of countenance at this that he affirmed Morgan was in the secret and repeated from his own inventionOakhum said  "Ay ay I see they are both in a story"  and dismissed my fellowmate to his cockloft although I proposed that he and I should read and translate separately any chapter or verse in the Greektestament in his possession by which it would appear whether we or the surgeon spoke truthNot being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person on board who understood Greek Accordingly the whole ship's company officers and all were called upon deck among whom it was proclaimed that if any of them could speak Greek he or they so qualified should ascend the quarterdeck immediatelyAfter some pause two foremastmen came up and professed their skill in that language which they said they acquired during several voyages to the Levant among the Greeks of the Morea The captain exulted much in this declaration and put my journalbook into the hands of one of them who candidly owned he could neither read nor write the other acknowledged the same degree of ignorance but pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board and addressing himself to me pronounced some sentences of a barbarous corrupted language which I did not understandI asserted that the modern Greek was as different from that spoke and written by the ancients as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time of Hengist and as I had only learned the true original tongue in  which Homer Pindar the evangelists and other Great men of antiquity wrote it could not be supposed that I should know any thing of an imperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former and scarce retained any traces of the old expressionBut if doctor Mackshane who pretended to be master of the Greek language could maintain a conversation with these seamen I would retract what I had said and be content to suffer any punishment he should think proper to inflictI had no sooner uttered these words than the surgeon knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman accosted him in Irish and was answered in the same brogue then a dialogue ensued between them which they affirmed to be Greek after having secured the secrecy of the other tar who had his cue in the language of the Morea from his companion before they would venture to assert such an intrepid falshood  "I thought said Oakhum we should discover the imposture at lastLet the rascal be carried back to his confinementI find he must dangle"  Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf before a court so prejudiced with spite and fortified with ignorance against truth I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellowprisoner who hearing the particulars of my trial lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven and uttered a dreadful groan and not daring to disburthen his thoughts to me by speech lest he might be overheard by the centinel burst forth into a Welch song which he accompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of body  CHAP XXXI  I discover a subornation against me by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences in consequence of which I am set at liberty and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same termsMackshane's malicewe arrive at Jamaica from whence in a short time we beat up to Hispaniola in conjunction with the WestIndian squadronwe take in water sail again and arrive at Carthagenareflections on our conduct there  MEAN while a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks the one to be revenged of the other came and discovered to us the mystery of Mackshane's dialogue as I have explained it above This detection coming to the ears of the doctor who was sensible that now we were in sight of Jamaica we should have an opportunity of clearing ourselves before a courtmartial and at the same time of making his malice and ignorance conspicuous he interceeded for us with the captain so effectually that in a few hours we were set at liberty and ordered to return to our dutyThis was a happy event for me my whole body being blistered by the sun and my limbs benumbed for want of motion But I could not persuade the Welchman to accept of this indulgence  he persisting in his obstinacy to remain in irons until he should be discharged by a courtmartial which he believed would also do him justice on his enemies at length I represented to him the precarious issue of a trial the power and interest of his adversaries and flattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his resentment with his own hands upon Mackshane after our return to England This last argument had more weight with him than all the rest and prevailed upon him to repair with me to the cockpit which I no sooner entered than the idea of my departed friend presented itself to my remembrance and filled my eyes with tearsWe discharged from our mess the boy who had acted so perfidiously notwithstanding his tears intreaties and professions of penitence for what he had done but not before he had confessed that the surgeon had bribed him to give evidence against us with a pair of stockings and a couple of old check shirts which his servant had since plundered him of  The keys of our chests and lockers being sent to us by the doctor we detained the messenger until we had examined the contents and my fellowmate finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed to a crust his brandy exhausted and his onions gone was seized with a fit of choler which he discharged on Mackshane's man in oaths and execrations threatning to prosecute him as a thiefThe fellow swore in his turn that he never had the keys in his possession till that time when he received them from his master with orders to deliver them to us  "As Got is my judge cried Morgan and my salfation and my witness whosoever has pilfered my provisions  is a lousy beggarly rascally knave and by the soul of my grandsire I will impeach and accuse and indict him of a roppery if I did but know who he is"  Had this happened at sea where we could not repair the loss in all probability this descendant of Cadwallader would have lost his wits entirely but when I observed how easy it would be to make up for this paultry misfortune he became more calm and reconciled himself to the occasionA little while after the surgeon came into the birth under pretence of taking something out of the medicinechest and with a smiling aspect wished us joy of our deliverance which he said he had been at great pains to obtain of the captain who was very justly incensed at our behaviour but he the doctor had passed his word for our conduct in time to come and he hoped we should give him no cause to repent of his kindnessHe expected no doubt an acknowledgment from us for this pretended piece of service as well as a general amnesty of what was past but he had to do with people who were not quite so apt to forgive injuries as he imagined or to forget that if our deliverance was owing to his mediation our calamity was occasioned by his malice I therefore sat silent while my companion answered  "Ay ay 'tis no matterGot knows the heartthere is a time for all things as the wise man saith there is a time for throwing away stones and a time to gather them up again"  He seemed to be disconcerted at this reply and went away in a pet muttering something about  "Ingratitude"  and  "Fellows"  which we did not think fit to take any notice of  Our fleet having joined another that waited for us lay at anchor about a month in the harbour of PortRoyal in Jamaica during which time something of consequence was certainly transacted notwithstanding the insinuations of some who affirmed we had no business at all in that placethat in order to take the advantage of the season proper for our enterprize the WestIndian squadron which had previous notice of our coming ought to have joined us at the west end of Hispaniola with necessary stores and refreshments from whence we could have sailed directly to Carthagena before the enemy could put themselves in a good posture of defence or indeed have an inkling of our design Be this as it will we sailed from Jamaica and in ten days or a fortnight beat up against the wind as far as the isle of Vache with an intention as was said to attack the French fleet then supposed to be lying near that place but before we arrived they had sailed for Europe having first dispatched an adviceboat to Carthagena with an account of our being in these seas as also of our strength and destinationWe loitered here some days longer taking in wood and brackish water in the use whereof however our admiral seemed to consult the health of the men by restricting each to a quart a dayAt length we set sail and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena where we came to an anchor and lay at our ease ten days longerHere again certain malicious people take occasion to blame the conduct of their superiors by saying this was not only throwing away time which was very precious considering the approach of the rainy season but also giving the Spaniards time to recollect  themselves and recover from the consternation they were thrown into at the approach of an English fleet at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in that part of the world before But if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of our chiefs who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give them even over an enemy At last however we weighed and anchored again somewhat nearer the harbour's mouth where we made shift to land our marines who encamped on the beach in despite of the enemy's shot which knocked a good many of them on the headThis piece of conduct in chusing a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification which I believe never happened before was practised I presume with a view of accustoming the soldiers to stand fire who were not as yet much used to discipline most of them having been taken from the ploughtail a few months beforeThis again has furnished matter for censure against the Ministry for sending a few raw recruits on such an important enterprize while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at home But surely our governours had their reasons for so doing which possibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep Perhaps they were loth to risk their best troops on such desperate service or may be the colonels and field officers of the old corps who generally speaking enjoyed their commissions as sinecures or pensions for some domestick services tendered to the court refused to embark in such a dangerous and precarious undertaking for which no doubt they are to be much commended  CHAP XXXII  Our land forces being disembarked erect a faschine batteryour ship is ordered with four more to batter the fort of Bocca ChicaMackshane's cowardicethe chaplain's phrenzyhonest Rattlin lases one handhis heroism and reflections on the battleCrampley's behaviour to me during the heat of the fight  OUR forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned set about erecting a faschine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy and in something more than three weeks it was ready to open That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as possible it was determined in a council of war that five of our largest ships should attack the fort on one side while the battery plyed it on the other strengthened with two mortars and twentyfour cohorns  Accordingly the signal for our ship to engage among others was hoisted we being advertised the night before to make every thing clear for that purpose and in so doing a difference happened between captain Oakhum and his wellbeloved cousin and counsellor Mackshane which had well nigh terminated in an open ruptureThe doctor who had imagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy's shot in the  cockpit than in the center of the earth was lately informed that a surgeon's mate had been killed in that place by a cannonball from two small forts that were destroyed before the disembarkation of our soldiers and therefore insisted upon having a platform raised for the convenience of the sick and wounded in the afterhold where he deemed himself more secure than on the deck aboveThe captain offended at this extraordinary proposal accused him of pusilanimity and told him there was no room in the hold for such an occasion or if there was he could not expect to be indulged more than the rest of the surgeons of the navy who used the cockpit for that purpose Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate he persisted in his demand and shewed his instructions by which it was authorised The captain swore these instructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at sea but was obliged to comply and sent for the carpenter to give him orders about it But before any such measure could be taken our signal was thrown out and the doctor compelled to trust his carcase in the cockpit where Morgan and I were busy in putting our instruments and dressings in order  Our ship with the others destined for this service immediately weighed and in less than half an hour came to an anchor before the castle of Bocca Chica with a spring upon our cableThe cannonading which indeed was terrible began The surgeon after having crossed himself fell flat on the deck and the chaplain and purser who were stationed with us in quality of assistants followed his example while the Welchman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great discomposure scarce able to refrain  from the like prostrationAnd that the reader may know it was not a common occasion that alarmed us thus I must inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that astonished us The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from Bocca Chica mounting eightyfour great guns beside a mortar and small arms from fort St Joseph mounting thirtysix from two faschine batteries mounting twenty and from four men of war mounting sixtyfour guns eachThis was answered by us from our land battery mounting twentyone cannon our bomb battery mounting two mortars and twentyfour cohorns and five men of war two of eighty and three of seventy guns which fired without intermissionWe had not been many minutes engaged when one of the sailors brought another on his back to the cockpit where he tossed him down like a bag of oats and pulling out his pouch put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth without speaking a word Morgan immediately examined the condition of the wounded man and cried  "As I shall answer now the man is as tead as my greatgrandfather"  "Dead said his comrade he may be dead now for ought I know but I'll be dmn'd if he was not alive when I took him up"  So saying he was about to return to his quarters when I bid him carry the body along with him and throw it overboard  "Dn the body said he I think 'tis fair enough if I take care of my own"  My fellowmate snatching up the amputation knife pursued him halfway up the cockpit ladder crying  "You lousy rascal is this the churchyard or the charnelhouse or the sepulchre or the Golgotha of the ship"  but was stopt in his  carreer by one calling  "Yo ho avast therescaldings"  "Scaldings answered Morgan Got knows 'tis hot enough indeedwho are you"  "Here's one replied the voice"  and I immediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack Rattlin who coming towards me told me with great deliberation he was come to be dock'd at last and discovered the remains of one hand which had been shattered to pieces with grape shotI lamented with unfeigned sorrow his misfortune which he bore with heroic courage observing that every shot had its commission It was well it did not take him in the head or if it had what then he should have died bravely fighting for his king and country Death was a debt which every man owed and must pay now as well as another timeI was much pleased and edified with the maxims of this seaphilosopher who endured the amputation of his left hand without shrinking the operation being performed at his request by me after Mackshane who was with difficulty prevailed to lift his head from the deck had declared there was a necessity for his losing the limbWhile I was employed in dressing the stump I asked Jack's opinion of the battle who shaking his head frankly told me he believed we should do no good  "For why because instead of dropping anchor close under shore where we should have had to deal with one corner of Bocca Chica only we had opened the harbour and exposed ourselves to the whole fire of the enemy from their shipping and fort St Joseph as well as from the castle we intended to canonade that besides we lay at too great a distance to damage the walls and three parts in four of our shot did not take place for  there was scarce any body on board who understood the pointing of a gunAh God help us continued he if your kinsman lieutenant Bowling had been here we should have had otherguesswork"  By this time our patients had increased to such a degree that we did not know which to begin with and the first mate plainly told the surgeon that if he did not get up immediately and perform his duty he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral and make application for his warrantThis effectually roused Mackshane who was never  eaf to an argument in which he thought his interest was concerned he therefore rose up and in order to strengthen his resolution had recourse more than once to a casebottle of rum which he freely communicated to the chaplain and purser who had as much need of such extraordinary inspiration as himself Being thus supported he went to work and arms and legs were hewed down without mercyThe fumes of the liquor mounting into the parson's brain conspired with his former agitation of spirits to make him quite delirious he stript himself to the skin and besmearing his body with blood could scarce be withheld from running upon deck in that condition Jack Rattlin scandalized at this deportment endeavoured to allay his transports with reason but finding all he said ineffectual and great confusion occasioned by his frolicks he knocked him down with his right hand and by threats kept him quiet in that state of humiliationBut it was not in the power of rum to elevate the purser who sat on the floor wringing his hands and cursing the hour in which he left his peaceable profession of a brewer in Rochester to engage in  such a life of terror and disquietWhile we diverted ourselves at the expence of this poor devil a shot happened to take us between wind and water and its course being through the purser's storeroom made a terrible havock and noise among the jars and bottles in its way and disconcerted Mackshane so much that he dropt his scalpel and falling down on his knees pronounced his  Paternoster  aloud the purser fell backward and lay without sense or motion and the chaplain grew so outrageous that Rattlin with one hand could not keep him under so that we were obliged to confine him in the surgeon's cabbin where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand extravaganciesMuch about this time my old antagonist Crampley came down with express orders as he said to bring me up to the quarterdeck to dress a slight wound the captain had received by a splinter His reason for honouring me in particular with this piece of service being that in case I should be killed or disabled by the way my death or mutilation would be of less consequence to the ship's company than that of the doctor or his first mateAt another time perhaps I might have disputed this order to which I was not bound to pay the least regard but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than he to expose myself to dangerWith this view I provided myself with dressings and followed him immediately to the quarterdeck through a most infernal scene of slaughter fire smoak and uproar Captain Oakhum who leaned against the mizen mast no sooner  me approach in my shirt with the sleeves t  ed up to my armpits  and my hands dyed with blood than he signified his displeasure by a frown and asked why the doctor himself did not come I told him Crampley had singled me out as if by his express command at which he seemed surprized and threatened to punish the midshipman for his presumption after the engagement In the mean time I was sent back to my station and ordered to tell Mackshane that the captain expected him immediatelyI got safe back and delivered up my commission to the doctor who flatly refused to quit the post assigned to him by his instructions Hereupon Morgan who I believe was jealous of my reputation for courage undertook the affair and ascended with great intrepidityThe captain finding the surgeon obstinate suffered himself to be dressed and swore he would confine Mackshane as soon as that service should be over  CHAP XXXIII  A breach being made in the walls our soldiers give the assault take the place without oppositionour sailors at the same time become masters of all the

effort of the admiral to take the Townthe oeconomy of our expedition described  HAVING cannonaded the fort during the space of four hours we were all ordered to slip our cables and sheer off but next day the engagement was renewed and continued from the morning till the afternoon when the enemy's fire from Bocca Chica slackened and towards evening was quite silencedA breach being made on the other side by our landbattery large enough to admit a middle sized baboon  provided he could find means to climb up to it our general proposed to give the assault that very night and actually ordered a detachment on that duty Providence stood our friend upon this occasion and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort which might have been maintained by resolute men to the day of judgment against all the force we could exert in the attackAnd while our soldiers took possession of the enemy's ramparts without resistance the same good luck attended a body of sailors who made themselves masters of fort St Joseph the faschine batteries and one Spanish man of war the other three being burnt or sunk by the foe that they might not fall into our handsThe taking of these forts in the strength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided made us masters of the outward harbour and occasioned great joy among us as we laid our accounts with finding little or no opposition from the town And indeed if a few great ships had sailed up immediately before they had recovered from the confusion and despair that our unexpected success had produced among them it is not impossible that we might have finished the affair to our satisfaction without any more bloodshed but this our Heroes disdained as a barbarous insult over the enemy's distress and gave them all the respite they could desire in order to recollect themselvesIn the mean time Mackshane taking the advantage of this general exultation waited on our captain and pleaded his own cause so effectually that he was reestablished in his good graces and as for Crampley there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me during the actionBut of all the  consequences of the victory none was more grateful than plenty of fresh water after we had languished five weeks on the allowance of a purser's quart  per diem  for each man in the Torrid Zone where the sun was vertical and the expence of bodily fluid so great that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste of twentyfour hours especially as our provision consisted of putrid salt beef to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse salt pork of New England which though neither fish nor flesh savoured of both bread from the same country every biscuit whereof like a piece of clock work moved by its own internal impulse occasioned by the myriads of insects that dwelt within it and butter served out by the gill that tasted like trainoil thickened with salt Instead of smallbeer each man was allowed three half quarterns of brandy or rum which was distributed every morning diluted with a certain quantity of his water without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable for which reason this composition was by the sailors not unaptly stiled  Necessity  Nor was this limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity of it on board there being at this time water enough in the ship for a voyage of six months at the rate of half a gallon  per  day to each man But this fast must I suppose have been injoined by way of pennance on the ship's company for their sins or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life that they might thereby become more resolute and regardless of danger How simply then do those people argue who ascribe the great mortality among us to our bad provision and want of water  and affirm that a great many valuable lives might have been saved if the useless transports had been employed in fetching fresh stock turtle fruit and other refreshments from Jamaica and other adjacent islands for the use of the army and fleet seeing it is to be hoped that those who died went to a better place and those who survived were the more easily maintainedAfter all a sufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St Lazar where they behaved like their own country mastifs which shut their eyes run into the jaws of a bear and have their heads crushed for their valour  But to return to my narration After having put garrisons into the forts we had taken and reimbarked our soldiers and artillery which detained us more than a week we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour guarded by a large fortification on one side and a small redoubt on the other both of which were deserted before our approach and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by several old galleons that the enemy had sunk in the channelWe made shift however to open a passage for some ships of war that favoured the second landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta not far from the town where after a faint resistance from a body of Spaniards who opposed their disembarkation they encamped with a design of besieging the castle of St Lazar which overlooked and commanded the city Whether our renowned general had no body in his army who knew how to approach it in form or that he trusted intirely to the fame of his arms I shall not determine but certain it is a resolution was taken in  a council of war to attack the place with musquetry only which was put in execution and succeeded accordingly the enemy giving them such an hearty reception that the greatest part of the detachment took up their everlasting residence on the spotOur chief not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniards was wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army which from eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for serviceThe sick and wounded were squeezed into certain vessels which thence obtained the name of hospital ships though methinks they scarce deserved such a creditable title seeing none of them could boast of either surgeon nurse or cook and the space between decks was so confined that the miserable patients had not room to sit upright in their beds Their wounds and stumps being neglected contracted filth and putrefaction and millions of maggots were hatched amid the corruption of their sores This inhuman disregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons though it is well known that every great ship in the fleet could have spared one at least for this duty which would have been more than sufficient to remove this shocking inconvenience But perhaps the general was too much of a gentleman to ask a favour of this kind from his fellowchief who on the other hand would not derogate so far from his own dignity as to offer such assistance unasked for I may venture to affirm that by this time the Daemon of discord with her sooty wings had breathed her influence upon our counsels and it might be said of these great men  I hope they will pardon the comparison as of Caesar and Pompey the one could not brook a superior and the other was impatient of an equal So that between the pride of one and insolence of another the enterprize miscarried according to the proverb  "Between two stools the backside falls to the ground"  Not that I would be thought to liken any publick concern to that opprobrious part of the human body although I might with truth assert if I durst use such a vulgar idiom that the nation did hang an ase at its disappointment on this occasion neither would I presume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience as a jointstool or a closestool but only signify by this simile the mistake the people committed in trusting to the union of two instruments that were never joined  A day or two after the attempt on St Lazar the admiral ordered one of the Spanish men of war we had taken to be mounted with sixteen guns and manned with detachments from our great ships in order to batter the town accordingly she was towed into the inner harbour in the nighttime and moored within half a mile of the walls against which she began to fire at daybreak and continued about four hours exposed to the opposition of at least forty pieces of cannon which at length obliged our men to set her on fire and get off as well as they could in their boatsThis piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the wits either in the army or the navy who were at last fain to acknowledge it a stroke of policy above their comprehensionSome entertained such an irreverent  opinion of the admiral's understanding as to think he expected the town would surrender to his floating battery of sixteen guns Others imagined his sole intention was to try the enemy's strength by which he would be able to compute the number of great ships that would be necessary to bring the Spaniards to a capitulation But this last conjecture soon appeared groundless in as much as no ships of any kind whatever were afterwards employed on that serviceA third sort swore that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking than that which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill A fourth class and that the most numerous though without doubt composed of the sanguine and malicious plainly taxed this commander with want of honesty as well as sense and alledged that he ought to have sacrificed private pique to the interest of his country that where the lives of so many brave fellow citizens were concerned he ought to have concurred with the general without being sollicited or even desired towards their preservation and advantage that if his arguments could not dissuade him from a desperate enterprize it was his duty to render it as practicable as possible without running extreme hazard that this could have been done with a good prospect of success by ordering five or six large ships to batter the town while the land forces stormed the castle by this means a considerable diversion would have been made in favour of those troops who in their march to the assault and in the retreat suffered much more from the town than from the castle that the inhabitants seeing themselves vigorously attacked on  all hands would have been divided distracted and confused and in all probability unable to resist the assailantsBut all these suggestions surely proceed from ignorance and malevolence or else the admiral would not have found it such an easy matter at his return to England to justify his conduct to a ministry at once so upright and discerningTrue it is that those who undertook to vindicate him on the spot asserted there was not water enough for our great ships near the town tho' this was a little unfortunately urged because there happened to be pilots in the fleet perfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the harbour who affirmed there was water enough for five eighty gun ships to lye abreast in almost up at the very wallsThe disappointments we suffered occasioned an universal dejection which was not at all alleviated by the objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes nor by the prospect of what must inevitably happen if we remained much longer in this placeSuch was the oeconomy in some ships that rather than be at the trouble of interring the dead their commanders ordered their men to throw the bodies overboard many withouteither ballast or windingsheet so that numbers of human carcasses floated in the harbour until they were devoured by sharks and carrion crows which afforded no agreeable spectacle to those who survivedAt the same time the wet season began during which a deluge of rain falls from the rising to the setting of the sun without intermission and that no sooner ceases than it begins to thunder and lighten with such continual flashing that one can see to read a very small print by the illumination  CHAP XXXIV  An epidemick fever rages among uswe abandon our conquestsI am seized with the distemper write a petition to the captain which is rejectedI am in danger of suffocation through the malice of Crampley and relieved by a serjeantmy fever increasesthe chaplain wants to confess meI obtain a favourable crisisMorgan's affection for me provedthe behaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards meCaptain Oakhum is removed into another ship with his beloved doctorour new captain describedan adventure of Morgan  THE change of the atmosphere occasioned by this phoenomenon conspired with the stench that surrounded us the heat of the climate our own constitutions impoverished by bad provision and our despair to introduce the bilious fever among us which raged with such violence that three fourths of those whom it invaded died in a deplorable manner the colour of their skin being by the extreme putrefaction of their juices changed into that of soot  Our conductors finding things in this situation perceived it was high time to relinquish our conquests which we did after having rendered their  artillery useless and blown up their walls with gunpowderJust as we sailed from Bocca Chica on our return to Jamaica I found myself threatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper and knowing very well that I stood no chance for my life if I should be obliged to lie in the cockpit which by this time was grown intolerable even to people in health by reason of the heat and unwholsome smell of decayed provision I wrote a petition to the captain representing my case and humbly imploring his permission to lie among the soldiers in the middledeck for the benefit of the air But I might have spared myself the trouble for this humane commander refused my request and ordered me to continue in the place allotted for the surgeon's mates or else be contented to lie in the hospital which by the bye was three degrees more offensive and more suffocating than our own birth belowAnother in my condition perhaps would have submitted to his fate and died in a pet but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune I therefore without minding Oakhum's injunction prevailed upon the soldiers whose goodwill I had acquired to admit my hammock among them and actually congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation which Crampley no sooner understood than he signified to the captain my contempt of his orders and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper habitationThis barbarous piece of revenge incensed me so much against the author that I vowed with bitter imprecations to call him to a severe account if ever it should be in  my power and the agitation of my spirits increased my fever to a violent degreeWhile I lay gasping for breath in this infernal abode I was visited by a serjeant the bones of whose nose I had reduced and set to rights after they had been demolished by a splinter during our last engagement He being informed of my condition offered me the use of his birth in the middledeck which was inclosed with canvas and wellaired by a porthole that remained open within itI embraced this proposal with joy and was immediately conducted to the place where I was treated while my illness lasted with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier who had no other bed for himself than a hencoop during the whole passageHere I lay and enjoyed the breeze notwithstanding of which my malady gained ground and at length my life was despaired of though I never lost hopes of recovery even when I had the mortification to see from my cabbin window six or seven thrown overboard every day who died of the same distemper This confidence I am persuaded conduced a good deal to the preservation of my life especially when joined to another resolution I took at the beginning namely to refuse all medicine which I could not help thinking cooperated with the disease and instead of resisting putrefaction promoted a total degeneracy of the vital fluidWhen my friend Morgan therefore brought his diaphoretic boluses I put them in my mouth 'tis true but without any intention of swallowing them and when he went away spit them out and washed my mouth with watergruel I seemingly complied in this manner that I might not affront the  blood of Caractacus by a refusal which might have intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity for he acted as my physician doctor Macshane never once enquiring about me or even knowing where I wasWhen my distemper was at the height Morgan thought my case desperate and after having applied a blister to the nape of my neck squeezed my hand bidding me with a woful countenance recommend myself to Got and my reteemer then taking his leave desired the chaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to me but before he arrived I had made shift to rid myself of the troublesome application the Welchman had bestowed on my backThe parson having felt my pulse enquired into the nature of my complaints hemmed a little and began thus  "Mr Random God out of his infinite mercy hath been pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper the issue of which no man knowsYou may be permitted to recover and live many days on the face of the earth and which is more probable you may be taken away and cut off in the flower of your youth It is incumbent on you therefore to prepare for the great change by repenting sincerely of your sins of this there cannot be a greater sign than an ingen'ous confession which I conjure you to make without hesitaton or mental reservation and when I am convinced of your sincerity I will then give you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of Without doubt you have been guilty of numberless transgressions to which youth is subject as swearing drunkenness whoredom and adultery tell me therefore without  reserve the particulars of each especially of the last that I may be acquainted with the true state of your conscience For no physician will prescribe for his patient until he knows the circumstances of his disease"  As I was not under any apprehensions of death I could not help smiling at the doctor's inquisitive remonstrance which I told him savoured more of the Roman than of the Protestant church in recommending auricular confession a thing in my opinion not at all necessary to salvation and which for that reason I declinedThis reply disconcerted him a little however he explained away his meaning in making learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary and what was only convenient then proceeded to ask what religion I professed I answered that I had not as yet considered the difference of religions consequently had not fixed on any one in particular but that I was bred a PresbyterianAt this word the chaplain discovered great astonishment and said he could not comprehend how a Presbyterian was entitled to any post under the English governmentThen he asked if I had ever received the Sacrament or taken the oaths to which I replying in the negative he held up his hands assured me he could do me no service wished I might not be in a state of reprobation and returned to his messmates who were making merry in the wardroom round a table well stored with bumbo  Bumbo is a liquor composed of rum sugar water and nutmeg  and wineThis insinuation terrible as it was had not such an effect upon me as the fever which soon after he had  left me grew outragious I began to see strange chimeras and concluded myself on the point of becoming delirious But before that happened was in great danger of suffocation upon which I started up in a kind of frantic fit with an intention to plunge myself into the sea and as my friend the serjeant was not present would certainly have cooled myself to some purpose had I not perceived a moisture upon my thigh as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock The appearance of this revived my hopes and I had reflection and resolution enough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom by tearing the shirt from my body and the sheets from my bed and wrapping myself in a thick blanket in which inclosure for about a quarter of an hour I felt the pains of hell but it was not long before I was recompensed for my suffering by a profuse sweat that bursting from the whole surface of my skin in less than two hours relieved me from all my complaints except that of weakness and left me as hungry as a kiteI enjoyed a very comfortable nap after which I was regaling myself with the agreeable reverie of my future happiness when I heard Morgan on the outside of the curtain ask the serjeant if I was still alive  "Alive cried the other God forbid he should be otherwise he has lain quiet these five hours and I do not chuse to disturb him for sleep will do him great service"  "Ay said my fellowmate he sleeps so sound look you that he will never waken till the great trump plowsGot be merciful to his soulHe has paid his debt like an honest manAy and moreover he is at rest from all persecutions and troubles and afflictions of  which Got knows and I know he had his own shareOchree Ochree he was a promising youth indeed"  So saying he groaned grievously and began to whine in such a manner as persuaded me he had a real friendship for meThe serjeant alarmed at his words came into the birth and while he looked upon me I smiled and tipt him the wink he immediately guessed my meaning and remained silent which confirmed Morgan in his opinion of my being dead whereupon he approached with tears in his eyes in order to indulge his grief with a sight of the object And I counterfeited death so well by fixing my eyes and droping my underjaw that he said  "There he lies no petter than a lump of clay Got help me"  And observed by the distortion of my face that I must have had a strong struggle I should not have been able to contain myself much longer when he began to perform the last duty of a friend in closing my eyes and my mouth upon which I suddenly snapped at his fingers and discomposed him so much that he started back turned pale as ashes and stared like the picture of horror Although I could not help laughing at his appearance I was concerned for his situation and stretched out my hand telling him I hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making in EnglandIt was some time before he could recollect himself so far as to feel my pulse and enquire into the particulars of my disease But when he found I had enjoyed a favourable crisis he congratulated me upon my good fortune not failing to ascribe it under Got to the blister he had applied to my back at his last visit which by the bye said  he must now be removed and dressed He was actually going to fetch dressings when I feigning astonishment said  "Bless me sure you never applied a blister to methere is nothing on my back I assure you"  Of this he could not be convinced till he had examined and then endeavoured to conceal his confusion by expressing his surprize in finding the skin untouched and the plaister missingIn order to excuse myself for paying so little regard to his prescription I pretended to have been insensible when it was put on and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium This apology satisfied my friend who on this occasion abated a good deal of his stiffness in regard to punctilios and as we were now safely arrived at Jamaica where I had the benefit of fresh provision and other refreshments I recovered strength every day and in a short time my health and vigour were perfectly reestablishedWhen I got up at first and was just able to crawl about the deck with a staff in my hand I met doctor Mackshane who passed by me with a disdainful look and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word After him came Crampley who strutting up to me with a fierce countenance pronounced  "Here's fine discipline on board when such lazy sculking sons of bches as you are allowed on pretence of sickness to lollop at your ease while your betters are kept to hard duty"  The sight and behaviour of this malicious scoundrel enraged me so much that I could scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate but when I considered my present feebleness and the enemies I had in the ship who wanted only  a pretence to ruin me I restrained my passion and contented myself with telling him I had not forgot his insolence and malice and that I hoped we should meet one day on shoreAt this he grinned shook his fist at me and swore he longed for nothing more than such an opportunity  Mean while our ship was ordered to be heaved down victualled and watered for her return to England and our captain for some reason or other not thinking it convenient for him to revisit his native country at this time exchanged with a gentleman who on the other hand wished for nothing so much as to be safe without the tropick all his care and tenderness of himself being insufficient to preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather  Our tyrant having left the ship and carried his favourite Mackshane along with him to my inexpressible satisfaction our new commander came on board in a tenoar'd barge overshadowed with a vast umbrella and appeared in every thing quite the reverse of Oakhum being a tall thin young man dressed in this manner a white hat garnished with a red feather adorned his head from whence his hair flowed down upon his shoulders in ringlets tied behind with a ribbonHis coat consisting of pinkcoloured silk lined with white by the elegance of the cut retired backward as it were to discover a white sattin waistcoat embroidered with gold unbuttoned at the upper part to display a broch set with garnets that glittered in the breast of his shirt which was of the finest cambrick edged with right mechlin The knees of his crimson velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his  silk stockings which rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs from shoes of blue Meroquin studded with diamond buckles that flamed forth rivals to the sun A steelhilted sword inlaid with figures of gold and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich tossle equipped his side and an amberheaded cane hung dangling from his wristBut the most remarkable parts or his furniture were a mask on his face and white gloves on his hands which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occasionally but were fixed with a ring set with a ruby on the little finger of one hand and by one set with a topaz on that of the otherIn this garb captain Whiffle for that was his name took possession of the ship surrounded with a crowd of attendants all of whom in their different degrees seemed to be of their patron's disposition and the air was so impregnated with perfumes that one may venture to affirm the clime of Arabia Foelix was not half so sweet scentedMy fellowmate observing no surgeon among his train thought he had found an occasion too favourable for himself to be neglected and remembring the old proverb  "Spare to speak and spare to speed"  resolved to sollicit the new captain's interest immediately before any other surgeon could be appointed for the shipWith this view he repaired to the cabbin in his ordinary dress consisting of a checkshirt and trousers a brown linen waistcoat and a nightcap of the same neither very clean which for his further misfortune happened to smell strong of tobaccoEntering without any ceremony into this sacred place he found captain  Whiffle reposing upon a couch with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body and a muslin cape bordered with lace upon his head and after several low conge's began in this manner  "Sir I hope you will forgive and excuse and pardon the presumption of one who has not the honour of being known unto you but who is nevertheless a shentleman porn and pred and moreover has had misfortunes Got help me in the world"  Here he was interrupted by the captain who at first sight of him had started up with great amazement at the novelty of the apparition and having recollected himself pronounced with a look and tone signifying disdain curiosity and surprize  "Zauns who art thou"  "I am surgeon's first first mate on board of this ship replied Morgan and I most vehemently desire and beseech you with all submission to be pleased to condescend and vouchsafe to enquire into my character and my pehaviour and my deserts which under Got I hope will entitle me to the vacancy of surgeon"  As he proceeded in his speech he continued advancing towards the captain whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatick flavour that exhaled from him than he cried with great emotion  "Heaven preserve me I am suffocatedFellow Fellow away with theeCurse thee fellow get thee goneI shall be stunk to death"  At the noise of his outcries his servants run into his apartment and he accosted them thus  "Villains cutthroats traitors I am betrayed I am sacrificedWill you not carry that monster away or must I be stifled with the  stench of him oh oh"  With these interjections he sunk down upon his settee in a fit his  valet de chambre  plied him with a smellingbottle one footman chased his temples with Hungary water another sprinkled the floor with spirits of lavender and a third pushed Morgan out of the cabbin who coming to the place where I was sat down with a demure countenance and according to his custom when he received any indignity which he durst not revenge began to sing a Welch dittyI guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know the cause but instead of answering me directly he asked with great emotion if I thought him a monster and a stinkard  "A monster and a stinkard said I with some surprize did any body call you so"  "Got is my judge replied he captain Fifle did call me both ay and all the water in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembranceI do affirm and avouch and maintain with my soul and my pody and my plood look you that I have no smells about me but such as a christian ought to have except the effluvia of topacco which is a cephalic odoriferous aromatick herb and he is a son of a mountaingoat who says otherwiseAs for my being a monster let that be as it is I am as Got was pleased to create me which peradventure is more than I shall aver of him who gave me that title for I will proclaim it before the world that he is disguised and transfigured and transmographied with affectation and whimsies and that he is more like a papoon than one of the human race"  CHAP XXXV  Captain Whiffle sends for mehis situation describedhis surgeon arrives prescribes for him and puts him to beda bed is put up for Mr Simper contiguous to the stateroom which with other parts of the captain's behaviour gives the ship's company a very unfavourable idea of their commanderI am detained in the WestIndies by the admiral and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon's mate

lieutenant of the sloopwe sail on a cruizetake a prize in which I arrive at Port Morant under the command of my mess mate with whom I live in great harmony  HE was going on with an elogium upon the captain when I received a message to clean myself and go up to the great cabbin which I immediately performed sweetening myself with rosewater from the medicinechest When I entered the room I was ordered to stand by  the door until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred me at a distance with a spyglass who having consulted one sense in this manner bid me advance gradually that his nose might have intelligence before it could be much offended I therefore approached with great caution and success and he was pleased to say  "Ay this creature is tolerable"  I found him lolling on his couch with a languishing air his head supported by his  valet de chambre  who from time to time applied a smellingbottle to his nose  "Vergette said he in a squeaking tone dost thou think this wretch meaning me will do me no injury may I venture to submit my arm to him"  "Pon my vord replied the valet I do tink dat dere be great occasion for your honour losing one small quantite of blodt and the yong mun ave qulque chose of de bonne mine  "Well then said his master I think I must venture"  Then addressing himself to me  "Hast thou ever blooded any body but brutesBut I need not ask thee for thou wilt tell me a most damnable lie"  "Brutes Sir answered I pulling down his glove in order to feel his pulse I never meddle with brutes"  "What the devil art thou about cried he dost thou intend to twist off my hand Gad's curse my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder Heaven have mercy upon me must I perish under the hands of savages What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon Mr Simper"  I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly and with the utmost care and tenderness tied up his arm with a fillet of silk While I was seeling  for the vein he desired to know how much blood I intended to take from him and when I answered  "Not above twelve ounces"  started up with a look full of horror and bid me begone swearing I had a design upon his lifeVergette appeased him with some difficulty and opening a bureau took out a pair of scales in one of which was placed a small cup and putting them into my hand told me the captain never lost above an ounce and three drachms at one timeWhile I prepared for this important evacuation there came into the cabbin a young man gayly dressed of a very delicate complexion with a kind of languid smile on his face which seemed to have been rendered habitual by a long course of affectationThe captain no sooner perceived him than rising hastily he flew into his arms crying  "O my dear Simper I am excessively disordered I have been betrayed frighted murdered by the negligence of my servants who suffered a beast a mule a bear to surprize me and stink me into convulsions with the fumes of tobacco"  Simper who by this time I found was obliged to art for the clearness of his complexion assumed an air of softness and sympathy and lamented with many tender expressions of sorrow the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition then feeling his patient's pulse on the outside of his glove gave it as his opinion that his disorder was entirely nervous and that some drops of tincture of castor and liquid laudanum would be of more service to him than bleeding by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits and composing the fermentation of his bile proceeding therefromI was  therefore sent to prepare this prescription which was administred in a glass of sackposset after the captain had been put to bed and orders sent to the officers on the quarterdeck to let no body walk on that side under which he lay  While the captain enjoyed his repose the doctor watched over him and indeed became so necessary that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the stateroom where Whiffle slept that he might be at hand in case of accidents in the nightNext day our commander being happily recovered gave orders that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck without a wig sword and ruffles nor any midshipman or other petty officer be seen with a check shirt or dirty linenHe also prohibited any person whatever except Simper and his own servants from coming into the great cabbin without first sending in to obtain leaveThese singular regulations did not prepossess the ship's company in his favour but on the contrary gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his character and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his surgeon not fit to be named  In a few weeks our ship was under sailing orders and I was in hopes of revisiting my native country in a very short time when the admiral's surgeon came on board and sending for Morgan and me to the quarterdeck gave me to understand there was a great scarcity of surgeons in the WestIndies that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great ship that was bound for England and desired us to agree among ourselves before the next day at that hour which of us should stay behindWe  were thunderstruck at this proposal and stared at one another some time without speaking at length the Welchman broke silence and offered to remain in the WestIndies provided the admiral would give him a surgeon's warrant immediately But he was told there was no want of chief surgeons and that he must be contented with the station of mate till he should be further provided for in due course Whereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the commissioners of the navy had appointed him and the other told him as plainly that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before tomorrow morning he must cast lots and abide by his chanceWhen I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in England where I had not one friend to promote my interest or favour my advancement in the navy and at the same time reflected on the present dearth of surgeons in the WestIndies and the unhealthiness of the climate which every day almost reduced the number I could not help thinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious by staying where I was than by returning to EuropeI therefore resolved to comply with a good grace and next day when we were ordered to throw dice told Morgan he needed not trouble himself for I would voluntarily submit to the admiral's pleasureThis frank declaration was commended by the gentleman who assured me it should not fare the worse with me for my resignation Indeed he was as good as his word and that very afternoon procured a warrant appointing me surgeon's mate of the Lizzard sloop of war which  put me on a footing with every first mate in the service  My ticket being made out I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe that was alongside and having shook hands with my trusty friend the serjeant and honest Jack Rattlin who was bound for Greenwichhospital I took my leave of Morgan with many tears after we had exchanged our sleevebuttons as remembrances of each otherHaving presented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard I enquired for the doctor whom I no sooner saw than I recollected him to be one of those young fellows with whom I had been committed to the roundhouse during our frolick with Jackson as I have related beforeHe received me with a good deal of courtesy and when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance expressed great joy in seeing me again and recommended me to an exceeding good mess composed of the gunner and the master's mateAs there was not one sick person in the ship I got leave to go ashore next day with the gunner who recommended me to a Jew that bought my ticket at the rate of  per cent  discount and having furnished myself with what necessaries I wanted returned on board in the evening and to my great surprize found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deckTho' I did not fear his enmity I was shocked at his appearance and communicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr Tomlins the surgeon who told me that Crampley by the dint of some friends about the admiral had procured a commission constituting him lieutenant on board the Lizzard and advised me now he was my superior officer  to behave with some respect towards him or else he would find a thousand opportunities of using me illThis advice was a bitter potion to me whom pride and resentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to or even of reconciliation with the wretch who had on many occasions treated me so inhumanly However I resolved to have as little connexion as possible with him and to ingratiate myself as much as I could with the rest of the officers whose friendship might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of his malice  In less than a week we sailed on a cruize and having got round the east end of the island had the good fortune to take a Spanish Barcolongo with her prize which was an English ship bound for Bristol that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight before without convoy All the prisoners who were well were put on shore on the northside of the island the prizes were manned with Englishmen and the command of the Barcolongo given to my friend the master's mate with orders to carry them into Port Morant and there to remain until the Lizzard's cruize should be ended at which time she would touch at the same place in her way to PortRoyalWith him I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen who amounted to sixteen and to take care of them on shore in a house that was to be hired as an hospitalThis destination gave me a great deal of pleasure as I would for some time be freed from the arrogance of Crampley whose inveteracy against me had already broke out on two or three occasions since he was become a lieutenantMy messmate who very  much resembled my uncle both in figure and disposition treated me on board of the prize with the utmost civility and confidence and among other favours made me a present of a silver hilted hanger and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal which fell to his share in plundering the enemyWe arrived safely at Morant and going ashore pitched upon an empty storehouse which we hired for the reception of the wounded who were brought to it next day with beds and other necessaries and four of the ship's company appointed to attend them and obey me  CHAP XXXVI  A strange adventurein consequence of which I am extremely happyCrampley does me ill offices with the captain But his malice is defeated by the goodnature and friendship of the surgeonwe return to PortRoyalour captain gets the command of a larger ship and is succeeded by an old manBrayl is provided forwe receive orders to sail for England  WHEN my patients were all in a fair way my companion and commander whose name was Brayl carried me up the country to the house of a rich planter with whom he was acquainted where we were sumptuously entertained  and in the evening set out on our return to the ship When we had walked about a mile by moonlight we perceived a horseman behind us who coming up wished us  good even  and asked which way we went His voice which was quite familiar to me no sooner struck my ear than in spite of all my resolution and reflection my hair bristled up and I was seized with a violent fit of trembling which Brayl misinterpreting bid me be under no concern for he would stand by meI told him he was mistaken in the cause of my disorder and addressing myself to the person on horseback said  "I could have sworn by your voice that you was a dear friend of mine if I had not been certain of his death"  To this after some pause he replied  "There are many voices as well as faces that resemble one another but pray what was your friend's name"  I satisfied him in that particular and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of Thomson not without many sighs and some tears A silence ensued which lasted some minutes and then the conversation turned on indifferent subjects till we arrived at a house on the road where the horseman alighted and begged with so much earnestness that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him that we could not resistBut if I was alarmed at his voice what must my amazement be when I discovered by the light the very person of my lamented friend Perceiving my confusion which was extreme he clasped me in his arms and bedewed my face with tearsIt was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason overpowered with this event and longer still before I could speak  So that all I was capable of was to return his embraces and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his while honest Brayl affected with the scene wept as fast as either of us and signified his participation of our happiness by hugging us both and capering about the room like a madmanAt length I retrieved the use of my tongue and cried  "Is it possible can you be my friend Thomson No certainly alas he was drowned and I am now under the deception of a dream"  Then I relapsed into tearsHe was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual person whom I regretted and bidding me sit down and compose myself promised to explain his sudden disappearance from the Thunder and to account for his being at present in the land of the livingThis he acquitted himself of after I had drank a glass of punch and recollected myself by informing us that with a determination to rid himself of a miserable existence he had gone in the nighttime to the head while the ship was on her way from whence he slipped down as softly as he could by the bows into the sea where after he was heartily ducked he began to repent of his precipitation and as he could swim very well kept himself above water in hopes of being taken up by some of the ships asternthat in this situation he hailed a large vessel and begged to be taken in but was answered that she was a heavy sailor and therefore they did not chuse to lose time by bringing to however they threw an old chest overboard for his convenience and told him that some of the ships astern would certainly save himthat no other vessel came  within sight or cry of him for the space of three hours during which time he had the mortification of finding himself in the middle of the ocean alone without support or restingplace but what a few crazy boards afforded till at last he discerned a small sloop steering towards him upon which he set up his throat and had the good fortune to be heard and rescued from the dreary waste by their boat which was hoisted out on purpose  "I was no sooner brought on board continued he than I fainted and when I recovered my senses found myself in bed regaled with a most noisome smell of onions and cheese which made me think at first that I was in my own hammock alongside of honest Morgan and that all which had passed was no more than a dreamUpon enquiry I understood that I was on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island bound for Jamaica with a cargo of geese pigs onions and cheese and that the master's name was Robertson by birth a North Briton whom I knew at first sight to be an old schoolfellow of mineWhen I discovered myself to him he was transported with surprize and joy and begged to know the occasion of my misfortune which I did not think fit to disclose because I knew his notions with regard to religion were very severe and confined therefore contented myself with telling him I fell overboard by accident but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my disagreeable station and of acquainting him with my determined purpose never to return to the Thunder man of war"  "Although he was not of my opinion in that  particular knowing that I must lose my cloaths and what pay was due to me unless I went back to my duty yet when I described the circumstances of the hellish life I led under the tyrannic sway of Oakhum and Mackshane and among other grievances hinted a dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my shipmates and the want of the true Presbyterian gospel doctrine he changed his sentiments and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside all thoughts of rising in the navy and that he might shew how much he had my interest at heart undertook to provide for me in some shape or other before he should leave JamaicaThis he performed to my heart's desire by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune with whom I have lived ever since in quality of surgeon and overseer to his plantationsHe and his lady are now at Kingston so that I am for the present master of this house to which from my soul I bid you welcome and hope you will favour me with your company during the remaining part of the night"  I needed not a second invitation but Mr Brayl who was a diligent and excellent officer could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship However he supped with us and after having drank a chearful glass set out for the vessel which was not above three miles from the place escorted by a couple of stout Negroes whom Mr Thomson ordered to conduct himNever were two friends more happy in the conversation of one another than we for the time it lasted I related to him the particulars of our attempt upon Carthagena  of which he had heard but an imperfect account and he gratified me with a narration of every little incident of his life since we partedHe assured me it was with the utmost reluctance he could resist his inclination of coming down to PortRoyal to see Morgan and me of whom he had heard no tidings since the day of our separation but that he was restrained by the fear of being detained as a deserterHe told me that when he heard my voice in the dark he was almost as much surprized as I was at seeing him afterwards and in the confidence of friendship disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived who by his description was a very amiable young lady and did not distain his addresses that he was very much favoured by her parents and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match which would at once render him independent of the worldI congratulated him on his good fortune which he protested should never make him forget his friend and towards morning we betook ourselves to rest  Next day he accompanied me to the ship where Mr Brayl entertained him at dinner and having spent the afternoon together he took his leave of us in the evening after he had forced upon me ten pistoles as a small token of his affectionIn short while we staid here we saw one another every day and generally eat at the same table which was plentifully supplied by him with all kinds of poultry butcher's meat oranges limes lemons pineaples Madeirawine and excellent rum so that this small interval of ten days was by far the most agreeable period of my life  At length the Lizzard arrived and as my patients were all fit for duty they and I were ordered on board of her where I understood from Mr Tomlins that there was a dryness between the lieutenant and him on my account that rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my absence to fill the captain's ears with a thousand scandalous stories to my prejudice among other things affirming that I had been once transported for theft and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipt for the same crimeThe surgeon on the other hand having heard my whole story from my own mouth defended me strenuously and in the course of that goodnatured office recounted all the instances of Crampley's malice against me while I remained on board of that shipWhich declaration while it satisfied the captain of my innocence made the lieutenant as much my defender's enemy as mine This infernal behaviour of Crampley with regard to me added such fuel to my former resentment that at certain times I was quite beside myself with the desire of revenge and was even tempted to pistol him on the quarterdeck though an infamous death must inevitably have been my rewardBut the surgeon who was my confident argued against such a desperate action so effectually that I stifled the flame which consumed me for the present and resolved to wait a more convenient opportunityIn the mean time that Mr Tomlins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellow's slander I begged he would go and visit Mr Thomson whose wonderful escape I had made him acquainted with and  enquire of him into the particulars of my conduct while he was my fellowmate This the surgeon complied with more through curiosity to see a person whose fate had been so extraordinary than to confirm his good opinion of me which he assured me was already firmly establishedHe therefore set out for the dwellingplace of my friend with a letter of introduction from me and being received with all the civility and kindness I expected returned to the ship not only satisfied with my character beyond the power of doubt or insinuation but also charmed with the affability and conversation of Thomson who loaded him and me with presents of fresh stock liquors and fruit As he would not venture to come and see us on board left Crampley should know and detain him when the time of our departure approached I obtained leave to go and bid him farewellAfter we had vowed an everlasting friendship he pressed upon me a purse with four double dubloons which I refused as long as I could without giving umbrage and having cordially embraced each other I returned on board where I found a small box with a letter directed for me to the care of Mr TomlinsKnowing the superscription to be of Thomson's handwriting I opened it with some surprize and learned that this generous friend not contented with loading me with the presents already mentioned had sent for my use and acceptance half a dozen fine shirts and as many linnen waistcoats and caps with twelve pair of new threadstockingsBeing thus provided with money and all necessaries for the comfort of life I began to look upon myself as a gentleman of some consequence and felt my pride dilate apace  Next day we sailed for PortRoyal where we arrived safely with our prizes and as there was nothing to do on board I went ashore and having purchased a laced waistcoat with some other cloaths at a vendue made a swaggering figure for some days among the taverns where I ventured to play a little at hazard and came off with fifty pistoles in my pocket Mean while our captain was promoted to a ship of twenty guns and the command of the Lizzard given to a man turned of fourscore who had been lieutenant since the reign of king William to this time and notwithstanding his long service would have probably died in that station had he not employed some prizemoney he had lately received to make interest with his superiors My friend Brayl was also made an officer about the same time after he had served in quality of midshipman and mate five and twenty years Soon after these alterations the admiral pitched upon our ship to carry home dispatches for the ministry accordingly we set sail for England having first scrubbed her bottom and taken in provision and water for the occasion  The END of the FIRST VOLUME
