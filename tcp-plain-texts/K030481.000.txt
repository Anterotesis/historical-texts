 ALZUMA A TRAGEDY AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  Humana ante oculos faed√® cum vita jaceret  In terris oppressa gravi sub religione  LUCRET  LONDON Printed for T LOWNDES No in  FleetStreet  MDCCLXXIII  Advertisement  THE precept which directs a poet to keep his piece nine years has been fully observed in regard to the following  Tragedy  but the  Author  will not claim the merit of voluntary submission to critical authority The delay he acknowledges did not arise from choice but was rather the consequence of difficulties that stood in his way and prevented an earlier access to the public  The Play was written in the year and the British forces were then actually doing at the HAVAN NAH what ALZUMA prays for in the third act The subject appeared of the first importance to the interests of humanity In perusing the history of the Spanish conquests in AMBRICA the AUTHOR found among unenlightened savages such instances of generosity truth justice courage and even clemency as would have done honour to those who profess'd in that part of the world to spread the light of truth and civilization The behaviour of ATAHUALPA called by English writers ATABALIPA the last INCA of PERU in his intercourse with FRYAR VINCENTI appeared particularly striking He heard the SPANISH MISSIONER with calm attention and replied  that it was absurd on the part of the  POPE  to grant away a territory which did not belong to him he would still continue to venerate the gods of his ancestors and if the christians worshipped a god that died he adored the sun that never died  He viewed the the prayerbook which the fryar put into his hands and after saying that it conveyed to him no information threw it down with a smile By this honest simplicity which would have gained the affections of a generous mind FATHER VINCENTI was so enraged that he gave the word of command crying out  "Kill the dogs who trample under foot the word of God"  An incident like this could not fail to excite indignation and that indignation rose still higher when it appeared that articles  of high treason were in form exhibited against ATAHUALPA and after that execrable farce of state the prince of a world just discovered suffered as a rebel to the Emperor Charles VWhen GUATIMOZIN one of the leading chiefs lies stretched upon the rack and hearing the groans of his fellow sufferer asks him in perfect tranquillity  Am I upon a bed of roses  the heart that does not melt with tenderness for the American must be as hard as FRYAR VINCENTI'S Not to multiply instances the story of a people massacred because they abounded in goldmines and had not heard the important truths of the christian religion seemed of all others the fittest for the English stage as it tended in a strong degree to that pathetic distress and that vigour of sentiment which constitute the essential beauty of tragedy  The author regretted that such a genius as DRYDEN had not left a play free from the jingle of rhyme and of a more legitimate kind that the present attempt might have been excluded He regretted also that from DRYDEN's time the poets of this nation seem to have abandoned the poor Americans to their fate He knew that FRANCE was in possession of a beautiful play upon the subject but the taste of LONDON and PARIS being very different the late Mr AARON HILL's translation of that piece appeared upon the English stage and vanished  The present writer was of opinion that so interesting a subject ought not to be neglected His first design was to new mould the ALZIRE of VOLTAIRE not in a vain presumption that he could excel a writer so justly famous throughout Europe but with an idea that he could in some instances adapt the scenes to the relish of an English audience That plan however was soon deserted it occurred that if this author followed the steps of MONSIEUR DE VOLTAIRE the words FRENCH TRANSLATOR UNBLUSHING PLAGIARY would fill the columns of every newspaper To civilities of this  kind the author has been used If the persons who have been so liberal feel themselves disposed to lavish their favours on the present occasion they will perhaps be glad of a hint that may supply ample materials If they will look into the plays of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES they will perceive in what school the writer of ALZUMA has studied the art of constructing a fable  Aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobis  Aptemus  VIDA POETIC  There was another reason for not adhering to the plan of VOLTAIRE In a country like this it was thought that our scene ought not to be indebted to a foreign writer for a play which involves the first great point of human liberty namely the right of man to think for himself In this opinion ALZUMA was written and except a few minute corrections in the course of the rehearsals was in its present form ready for the stage above ten years ago  There were indeed at that time certain reasons which made the author unwilling to precipitate himself into a dealing with managers Those reasons subsisted till Nov when this tragedy was put into the hands of Mr GARRICK It was copied out by the prompter of DruryLane theatre but remained in suspence till Sept when the Author found it upon his table without a letter or even a card The play it is true was not pronounced unworthy of representation but certainly was treated as a piece that did not deserve the least dispatch Delay was studied and the reasons for that delay existed no where but in Mr GARRICK's imagination A certain political society he was sure would damn any production known to come from the pen of the present writer Time however has shewn that he had not given umbrage to any set of men whatever In political controversy he had not meddled for a number of years and he takes this opportunity to declare that in his  whole life he never was the author of one clandestine line Whatever he writ he had the spirit and honour to avow it Mr GARRICK was told this but without effect the play was thrown back upon the author's hands he submitted to it and would have consigned all the circumstances of that transaction to oblivion if the same policy had not been practised upon him in another inftance this very winter  That ALZUMA has at length appeared is owing to the friendship of Mr HARRIS He desired to draw forth the piece from the author's closet Mr COLMAN accepted it with great frankness and from that instant went right forward without delay without duplicity without equivocation The author takes this opportunity to thank all the proprietors of Covent Garden Theatre for the fairness of their dealings His thanks are also due to the performers for their assiduity in preparing the play for representation The rest is before the public Mr BENSLEY and Mr HULL did justice to their respective characters Mr SMITH's exertion of distinguished merit is well known Miss MILLER struggled even in illness for the public favour and Mrs HARTLEYS' beauty and elegant performance adorned every scene in which she appeared  The Author cannot conclude without declaring that exclusive of his late transaction with Mr COLMAN he has every reason to be disgusted at the internal occurrences of a theatre It is therefore probable that he shall never again be a candidate for Theatical Fame From the farce of the APPRENTICE to the tragedy of ALZUMA his endeavours have at all times met with a most generous reception from the Town He feels the obligation with the warmest sensibility and remains with due respect to the PUBLIC  Their most obedient humble servant ARTHUR MURPHY  Lincoln'sInn  Feb  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  WHEN first COLUMBUS left the Spanish shore  In western climes new regions to explore  Soon a new world beyond the Atlantic main  Disclos'd the wonders of it's vast domain  A race of men unletter'd and untaught  Strangers to science yet with virtue fraught  No school they had of philosophic pride  And simple reason was their only guide  That reason in the paths of nature trod  And worshipping the Sun they meant a God  Free from the ills in polish'd life that spring  And gold with them was a neglected thing  But Europe's sons felt gold's resistless sway  To the new hemisphere they bend their way  Through ev'ry region carry sword and sire  And bigot rage and avarice conspire  Zeal bore the cross and poniard in it's hand  And massacre unpeopled half the land  Yet to unhappy men to heroes slain  The British muse denies her tragic strain  Dryden alone let fall the gen'rous tear  And bade on Albion's stage the FEATHER'D CHIEFS appear  His voice suppress'd no bard their fate has sung  Silent our scene and mute each tuneful tongue  While GREECE and ROME swell'd our theatric state  And only classic heroes could be great  This night our author an advent'er grown  Dares trace the virtues of the Torrid Zone  If in his scenes well painted passion glow  If there you view the draught of human woe  Britons will mark from fierce religious zeal  What dread calamities weak mortals feel  Will hear the INDIANtho' in error blind  Against the pow'r that would opinion bind  Assert the freedom of the human mind  Ye critics to whom poets must be civil  As Indians worship out of fear the devil  Of mod'rate principles you'll own the merit  Nor hither bring a persecuting spirit  Let modes of wit some TOLERATION share  Rome KILLS for errorBe it yours to spare  Dramatis Personae  ALZUMA  Mr SMITH  PIZARRO  Mr HULL  DON CARLOS  Mr BENSLEY  OZMAR  Mr PERRY  GONZALEZ  Mr GARDNER  EZMONT  Mr THOMPSON  ORAZIA  Miss MILLER

Wherefore this sudden hasteHow fares it now  With Orellana  Zilia  Still a calm repose  Suspends the tumult of the mighty passions  That war within Nature quite harrass'd down  Repairs the waste of grief  Emira  But oh too soon  With keener sense to waken her again  To the strong agonies that rend her soul  How wears the night  Zilia  It verges to the dawn  Emira  Then 'tis th' accustom'd hour

Perua Prince descended  From a long race of Kings ignobly fall  And welter in his blood before him  Emira  Yet  These are but fancied illsAlzuma lives  Safe in obscurity far hence remote  Prostrate Peru may lift her head again  And heav'n restore a brother to your arms  Orel  Delusive thought Yet let me fondly cherish  The soothing flatteryOh Sister virgins  Should e'er the hero bless my longing eyes  I could embrace him with a sister's love  And in his sight forget my sorrows past  But oh vain hopeHe would not know me now  Thus with'ring in my bloomAs yet an infant  number'd scarce ten years

 Much I esteem thy goodness much I honour  Thy many virtuesbut a holy vow  Forbids my love and tell me should I grant it  Would'st thou receive an interdicted wretch  With counterfeited smiles to thy

wrapp'd in errors mist's from fabling priests  Hears impious legends in each falling show'r  Each cloud that sails upon yon azure deep  Conceives the present deity in dreams  Which fever'd fancy forms

youth his boyish days  When the grim tiger from the thicket rush'd  Did he once flyDid he not ev'n then  Dare the encounterthe fell monster gor'd  His youthful breast and if his father's arm  Had not transfix'd the savage to the earth  Alzuma then had diedSince that he bore  The tiger's mark and ere the down of manhood  Sprung on his cheek went from his mother far  Grew up implacable of soul and now  With dire alarms shakes all the Western World  Carlos  And if our crimes provoke  Pizarro  Our crimes my son  Orazia  That thought to Orellana owes its birth  In soft captivity she holds him bound  Her beauty leads him with a single glance  Moves with a sigh and softens with a tear  And love and grace by turns dispute his heart  Pizarro  Hear Orellanasay thou beauteous mourner  How long

With expectation of the coming jest  By FASHION's law whene'er the TRAGIC MUSE  With sympathetic tears each eye bedews  When some BRIGHT VIRTUE at her call appears  Wak'd from the dead repose of rolling years  When SACRED WORTHIES she bids breathe anew  That men may bewhat she displays to view  By FASHION'S LAW with light fantastic mien  The COMIC SISTER trips it o'er the scene  Arm'd at all points with wit and wanton wiles  Plays off her airs and calls forth all her smiles  Till each fine feeling of the heart be o'er  And the gay wonder how they wept before  Say do you wish ye bright ye virtuous train  That ev'ry tear that fell should fall in vain  If this night's scenes soft pity could impart  Tis yours to fix the fashion of the heart  Adopt ye fair the lost Alzuma's cause  His ruin'd empire and expiring laws  For ORELLANA may I dare to plead  My faults will all your kind indulgence need  On you my hopes are fix'dOne smile from you  To me is worth the treasures of PERU  The
