the PULPIT  c  _WERE there not always a difference between real Grievances and Party Quarrels if a just Distinction were not to be made between the Complaints of a Nation and the Clamours of a Prejudic'd Party this Tract had not been publish'd  Again if there were not an evident difference between a Thirst of  Blood  and a Demand of  Justice  between Party Vengeance and Legal Prosecutions this Pen which has never yet been drawn in any of these Publick Quarrels had not now been Employ'd  Yet again If there were not Allowances needful to be made for the Characters of the Persons who Complain and a difference between the just Complaints of Men whose Principles Morals and Vertues gave them some Weight in the World and the Rudeness of Profligates and Bullies If there were not Distinctions to be made between Conscientious Pious Patriots known to be Lovers of their Country and Zealous for the Liberties and Priviledges of their Posterity and a vitious abandon'd Crew Bloody in Principle forsaken of all commendable Vertue swallow'd up in Revenge and the Prejudices of their Parties swelling in  Envy    Hatred    Malice    and all Uncharitableness  Raging for the Blood of those who they Hate and like some of their Fathers calling for  Justice    Justice  that they might draw the People into the worst sort of Murder If I say these Things had not been in the Case before me I who never engag'd in this manner before would not have undertaken this Task  But if these Men pass unreprov'd then all manner of Villanies must be Tolerated among us from the Authority of Bullies and Incendiaries and whoever these People please to prescribe as in the  Triumvirate  at  Rome  shall come to be Sacrificed under the Pretence of  Justice  The Cry is for  Justice  it is directed to the Government The Government would do wisely if they thought fit to do Justice on these Men who have the Face to tell them who must be put to Death by them and that the People expect it that is to say a  Party  expect it to please and gratifie their Revenge If Justice may not be obtained against such Insolence then each Hackney Writer shall lead the Ministry nay even the King himself to Cruelty and Blood to make good the Resentment of an Enraged Faction and to obey the Commands of a daring  Dissenting Preacher  and a detestable exasperated B To begin with the first of these  viz T Br  y  the Dissenting Preacher  How great the Rage of this Man is and how it transports him even beyond the Bounds of Modesty Duty and Justice will be best illustrated by Reflection upon the late Injunctions published by his Majesty's special Command Directing the Clergy to  Restrain themselves within the Limits of their Duty and not to intermeddle ni their Sermons with Affairs of State  It should seem this Man esteemeth himself as no Minister and so that he is not spoken to in these Injunctions or that the King's Injunctions are of such a private Interpretation that they should imply a Restraint to the Church Clergy only and an Allowance to all others to preach  Sedition  Or otherwise this Man must let the King know That the  Dissenting Preachers  do not think themselves under his Authority or within the Power of any of his Restraints so as to be liable to his Injunctions  It will be to the Purpose many Ways to consider the Insolence of this Man in his late manner of Preaching and what Views he must have in his behaving thus as also the unhappy Condition of the Church of  England  the State her Clergy are reduced to and the Injustice of Suffering the  Dissenting Preachers  thus to trample under their Feet the Ministers of that Church by whom they are indulged in the Liberties they shew themselves so unworthy to enjoy  The due Examination of these Particulars may it is hoped open the Eyes of those who at present seem so willing to Reduc  the Church to Extremities nay it may perhaps cause even the more Moderat  among the  Dissenters  to awake and to consider whether such Behaviour becomes their Ministers or Preachers whether it is their true Interest to act in this Manner and whether a Time may not come if the Church may ever recover from this Mischievous Usage when She may do Her self Justice  It must be acknowledg'd that the Church of  England will be in Danger  if Her Clergy must have their Mouths seal'd up and while they obey the Royal Injunctions publish'd by his Majesty's Command not to intermeddle with StateMatters in their Sermons the Dissenting Preachers as not Concern'd in that Command and as if by being not named in those Injunctions they had thereby an Indulgence for the Purpose take the Liberty to condemn to Death those who they please to prescribe and to call the People together to cry for  Blood    Blood  under the old Cant of  Justice    Justice  What Height of unparallel'd Insolence has been shewn in this Part by  B  t  and  B  y  and some others by  B  t  not to be parallel'd indeed but by one another in Two Pamphlets publish'd the last Week the one  A Letter to my Lord H  x  and the other  A Sermon on the late Thansgiving  Both calling on the Government for  Blood  both leading the King and Ministry to  Blood    which in these Men is Murther whateve  it must be in the other The Circumstance of both of these render the Crime flagrant and the Criminals odious  Preachers one would think ought no  to be Prompters of Blood and Revenge▪ more espeecially those who a few Year  past spoke so much for Moderation For+bearance Charity and what not yet thi  young Gentleman has given the World  Taste of the Justice which these Men  do  as well as of the Justice which they  seek  ▪ With what Front durst this Incendiary en+ter upon the Subject when he knew Hi  Majesty had but even then strictly forbid+den the Clergy to meddle in their Pulpit with such Matters Can he have the i  Manners to say That His Majesty design'd that the Mouths of the Clergy of th  Church of  England  should be stopped and the Mouths of Schismaticks and Dissenter  should be open'd What Satyr would thi  have been on the Person and Conduct o  the King And how would it have open'd the Mouths of the People against such par+tial Usage of the Church Who shall say the Church is not  in Danger  even in th  utmost Danger if this be Her Case I  on the other side he will say he does not un+derstand the  Injunctions  to be a prescribing the Clergy of the Church and leaving  the other Preachers of all the Sects free Then with what Front durst this Man disobey His Majesty's Injunctions and taking upon him to lead the King and his Ministry to what they ought or ought not to do to summon the People to call for Justice which as aforesaid is Blood and insinuate who are the Men they should clamour against which manifestly is practising Sedition and Murder  I am unacquainted with the Sects of Dissenters yet I have often heard that they have vindicated themselves or endeavour'd to do so frequently against the Charge often brought upon them of being regardless of Kings and Governments practising Sedition and such Things as these Those among them who are sober and modest must abhor this Man and his Preaching seeing the King from a Principle of Peaceableness as we would hope and to keep the People Quiet has forbid by the Injunctions publish'd in the Publick  Gazette  the Ministers of the Church to meddle with these Things This  B  y  surely ought to have esteemed himself equally restrained by those Injunctions otherwise he must expose the Justice of the King in the highest Manner If he has the Front to do this let him bring in his Plea let him say the King allow'd Dissenting Preachers  to meddle with StateAffairs in their Pul+pits while he denied the Church of  Eng+land  Ministers the same Liberty and say+ing and proving this will state the Condi+tion of the Church of  England  in a few Words and put it out of Question for th  future whether She is in Danger yea or no▪ This Incendiary is unable to deny but tha  he is expresly forbidden by the Injunction  to preach in this Manner as much as th  Church Clergy I have a better Opinion o  his Cunning than to suppose otherwise o  him nay should he flie to that weak and foolish Pretence  viz  That the Injunction  are directed to the Church of  England  Clergy only it would fail him seeing the very Words of the Injunctions will convict him The first Clause includes him and all those of his or of any other Sect thus▪  viz That no Preacher whatsoever in his Ser+mon or Lecture do presume    c  Vide  the In+junctions  wherein especially two Thing  are directed  Art  III  That above all Thing  THEY all Preachers whatsoever  abstain from bitter Invectives and scurrilous Languag  against all Persons whatsoever  Art IV  Tha  they do not presume  c  to intermeddle in an  Affairs of State or Government or the Con+stitution of the Realm  Where in the nex  place is then his Obedience to the Highe  Powers And more effectually Where hi  Regard to King  George  After all the fulsome Parasitical Stuff he has been so long venting about the King which is to honest Men odious and to the King Himself contemptible Is this his observing the Legal Injunctions as one of his Class calls them of the King upon the Clergy  Now should we call upon the Ministry to do Justice upon this Incendiary and implore his Majesty in his Justice to the Clergy of the Church of  England  and in Vindication of his own Injunctions to let this Offender be brought to condign Punishment This I perswade my self his Majesty will not deny or that on the other hand His Royal Justice will move him to take off those Injunctions from the Clergy of the Church which they now lye under the Restraints whereof they have with Deference to His Majesty strictly conformed to What just Complaints may the Clergy make of being hardly and unjustly dealt with if such a manifest Breach of His Majesty's Commands shall not be resented Is it not expressed in the said Injunctions that the Breach thereof will incur his Royal Displeasure and that the King will give Charge to the Judges and all their Civil Officers to do their Duty towards preventing and punishing such as shall offend herein And is it the Misfortune of the ChurchClergy  only to be capable of incurring his Majesty's Displeasure and the Dissenting Preachers who notwithstanding they are only admitted or suffer'd to Preach by a kind Exemption from the Punishment due by the Law to Schismaticks and Recusants may without Offence take that very Liberty which the others are forbidden What a desolate abandon'd Condition is the Church of  England  brought to if this be her Fate And where may we suppose this will end  But I will not perswade any true Churchman to entertain a Thought so prejudicial to the Honour of the King neither will I presume to suggest that the King can hear such Things if ever His Majesty shall have Opportunity to hear them without the utmost Resentment  Unhappy is the State of the Church of  England  if such Things can be practis'd in this Kingdom and not one of Her Members be so faithful to Her Interest as to give a true impartial Account of this Matter to Her Head and Sworn Defender But there is no room to doubt but some will be found who will lay these Things before the King and will inform His Majesty who they are that inflame and despise His Subjects by bitter Invectives in their Sermons and by scurrilous Language in  their Pulpits notwithstanding His Injunction to the contrary which if done wisely and with Clearness will soon convince His Majesty who they are that are the Cause of the present Dissatisfaction of his Subjects and who they are that desire he may be the Peaceable and Gracious Sovereign Lord over all his People It can scarce be believ'd that these Men should make any Impression on His Majesty by this way of Preaching and Printing but surely a faithful Account given to him of this Behaviour in Defiance of his Injunction must make Impression on his Mind very much to their Prejudice and no less to the Advantage of the publick Peace both in Church and State Mean time those who think that this Management of himself is becoming either the Person of this  Bradbury  who calls himself a Minister or his Friends the Dissenters  quatenus  Dissenter and tolerated by the Church may encourage him to proceed as he has begun but a Time may come when they may see themselves mistaken and may find they unseasonably discover'd the bloody Disposition to be so much their own There are many among the Dissenters who are sensible of it already and are only wanting in that they do not think fit to do themselves the Justice to declare their Minds which is  their Fear of the People and lest they should be cast out of the Synagogue  Loving the Praise of Men more  c  From this Preaching Incendiary I proceed to the LayPreacher  B  t  who takes upon him after a Series of Lewdness and Debauchery in his former Life to set up for an Instructor of Ministry and impudently tells the Ministers of State the King's Majesty and all that he expects the last Ministry should be sacrific'd to his Resentments and their Heads be given to him in a Charger as that Lewd Dancer did to  John  the Baptist  Were this Demand made by a less flagrant Villain one that had not been the Shame as well as Grief of his Father the Scandal of his Family and the Contempt of Men of Honour or had it been by one who had not sent his Right Reverend Father to Her late Majesty to beg Mercy for him and to entreat Her Majesty that a Just Prosecution might be stop'd which was issued against him for insulting Her Royal Person and Government which Application the very same Persons whose Bloods he now thirsts after were earnest Suiters to the Queen to accept and prompted Her Native Clemency to Pardon a Man whom his own Father had nothing to say for but meerly to ask it of her Grace and Goodness  the same Grace and Goodness which led Her to spare many more who now stamp upon Her Memory with the greatest Ingratitude and Contempt Was this Demand I say made by one who had not thus been in Debt to the Men he would destroy some Room would have been left to believe there might have been something of a Publick Spirited Zeal in the Motion however extravagant in itself and however it might be carried beyond the Bounds of Christianity and Honour  But when a Man is put into a Rage by Envy and in the height of a Party Distraction calls out for Blood and demands the Heads of such as he and his Fellow Furies have thought fit to prescribe it is Time then to let the World know the Meaning of these Things and what is to be said or done in the Case  The Actions of every  English  Man are to be enquir'd into by Legal Process heard in due Form and judg'd by the proper Persons It is Criminal for any One to tamper with the Juries who are to pass upon any Man in Cases of Life and Death to offer to Bribe or Prepossess them either to Acquit or Condemn it is not therefore allowed for any Man to enter upon his own Vindication in Publick while his Case is depending in any Court of Justice  because it is anticipating his Tryal and a prepossessing the People out of whom his Jury is to be Chosen and consequently prepossessing and tampering with the Jury itself in like manner ought not to be allowed That Men who are liable to be question'd in Publick for any Actions which they may have done which are supposed to be Illegal should be arraigned before Hand in Publick by every Lewd Scribler who in this respect prepossesses the World against them as much as in him lies find him Guilty before he is Tryed and Execute him as it were in Effigie When such Methods are made use of to make Men publickly Obnoxious it is a plain over awing those who may come to pass upon these Men for Life or Death who are made afraid to do Justice least they are mark'd out for the same popular Hatred What but this is the real Design of these Men They are for prepossessing the whole Nation with such Notions of the Guilt of the last Ministry That whosoever shall not find them Guilty when Impeach'd or shall not be forward to Impeach them shall be in danger of having his House pull'd down by the Rabble and of being set upon in the Streets on every Tumultuous Occasion  The Question before these Men is not  ow to do Justice whatever the specious watch Word is at this Time They must have the Blood of the Men they have mark'd out and if those who are to be Judges should not find every Man whom they Accuse Guilty they will be equally unsatisfied as they are now they tell the Ministers of State now that  they expect  the late Ministry shall be Impeach'd when that is done they will with the same imperious Tone tell the House of Lords they expect they should be  found Guilty  and to give a seeming Weight to their Insolence every Scribler now has learnt of  St  l  to speak High and say the Nation  expects it  than which nothing is more false for the Kingdom  expects  a healing of our Breaches not a widening them a Just Moderate and Clement Government not using Power to Oppression not gratifying Party Rage and setting one half the People to devour the other  The Ignorant young Man now speaking of has but one Thing in the whole Pamphlet which he has Publish'd that has Weight in it and this is That he says  All the Executors of a Sovereign's Illegal Orders from a Plenipotentiary down to a Constable are answerable for their Execution of them  This I say is all that has Weight in his Book  and this is what every Old Woman in Politicks knows and could have said as well as he The Men he Rails at and in his rough Language Abuses join Issue with the whole Party upon this Foot and then Challenge him and all his Brotherhood of the Bloodhound Pack for they are no  better to shew one illegal Order of Her Majesties which they have executed  After all that this scurrilous mad Creature has said to provoke his Readers to the same height with himself one would have thought he should have given an Instance of at least one Illegal Order issued by Her Majesty and executed by Her Ministry upon which they are to  expect  their Heads and I search'd narrowly for it but could not find the least appearance thereof which justifies fully the Liberty I take with these Two Scriblers in saying it is not Justice but Blood which they hunt after and least they should fail of obtaining the Heads of these Men by the Course of a Just Prosecution they are thus raising a Flame in the Minds of the People against them That if possible they may Awe the World not only into the Impeachment but into the Verdict and may signifie that whoever shall dissent shall be mark'd by the People to be sacrific'd by them upon the first Occasion What is this but  Blood  as  in my Title And how can the Government bear this without shewing a just Resentment or making Men fear that they are in worse Circumstances than it is hoped they ever will be  I know that there is a Design in these Men that looks another way and some of them have had Weakness enough to bewray the Folly  viz  They hope by this popular Rage to intimidate the Persons they threaten and filling them with apprehensions of not obtaining a fair and just Tryal oblige them to absent themselves and reserve their Defence for better Times It is true had the Persons Concern'd nothing to expect but what these envenom'd Spirits would do had they not a firm and fix'd Assurance that they can neither prove the Charge nor influence the House of Peers to condemn Men without Guilt and without fair Hearing were it not for this it must be confess'd it would be a Madness not to be accounted for That any Innocent Men should put themselves into their Hands but hitherto they have not been able to obtain that Point The Gentlemen stand fairly and are ready to defend themselves fairly and if they are accused it may with much more Justice and Modesty be said That the People of  England expect  they should be heard fairly and  used fairly and if Innocent be acquitted fairly and not be run down by Pamphlets and Preaching  The Parliament of  England  now of  Great Britain  is an Awful Assembly and it is hoped they will not permit themselves to be driven any more than led into any Thing which their own Wisdom does not satisfie them is for the good of their Country Their Business is well known to them they will not fail to do their Country Justice but they will not be made the Butchers of a Party No not altho' they were more compos'd of their own Friends than they are  We had indeed a Sett of Men who were called the  RedCoat Parliament  and they were indeed Tools of a Party and did the Drudgery which was provided for them whoever they liked not they found Guilty whoever their Supporters commanded them to Murther they Murther'd to Blast▪ they Blasted to Sacrifice they Sacrificed▪ But those were not a free Parliament they were nominated Arbitrarily Sword in Hand▪ as may properly be said by a Usurper and Rebel who was himself a Murtherer and a Parricide in the worst and most odiou  Sence of that Word for he was the slaye  of the Father of his Country  But if we have a free Parliament cho  en by the FreeHolders and Corporations  f  Great Britain  according to Law other Things will be found Redressing Grievan  es Establishing the Liberties of their Coun  ry and doing such Justice as Necessity requires will certainly be their Work and with as little Blood as possible The Par  aments of  Great Britain  content them  elves often with Redressing a Grievance without entring into every private Resentment and at the worst they pursue none  ut by Law and without private Views  f they did not act thus they would be ill  ualified to restore the Publick Tranquili  y What these Mad Fellows would bring  arliaments to I know very well but it  hoped the Gentlemen of  Great Britain  will let them know in due Time that it  not their Place either from the Pulpit or  ress to dictate to the Parliament who  hall be Impeach'd whose Head shall be cut  ff and whose not  The Design of this Tract is not to enter  nto a Defence of the late Management of  ffairs under the Queen or upon an En  uiry how far the Ministry acted according  their Duty I am not to try the Cause in  rint any more than these Men ought to  rraign them in the like manner but as  very Freeborn Subject of the  British  Crown has a Right to the Protection  the Laws and to complain of Injustice  in the Name of every Person aim'd at b  these Bloodthirsty Men I must enter th  Caveat by way of Protest That to arraig  Men by Popular Tumult  is illegal  To stir up others by Popular Tumults to ar+raign or impeach  is illegal  Accusation  must be brought with a clear Hand on th  Foot of publick Justice and no other nei+ther is publick Justice to be prompted or push'd on much less awed or influenced by publick Clamour every thing of that kind is illegal and will be called a malici+ous Prosecution The People of  Englan  are willing to have Justice done but the never desire to have  more than  Justice they desire generous Justice it is the Characte  of our Nation to act generously to thos  who submit to Justice nay Justice wit  Clemency is the distinguishing Characte  of all the Legal Proceedings in this Nation▪ it is known to be so and it is the Honou  of the Nation that it is so Foreigners wi  acknowledge the same to our great Repu+tation  The Gentlemen push'd at by these Fu+ries are Objects of this generous Justice▪ they freely cast themselves upon the Justic  of their Country they fly to the Protect  +on of the Laws which are their Birth+Right  It behoves the Government to take Care that they have no wrong done them I say it behoves the Government for in such Cases every Man who gives himself up to the Law is under the King's Protection in a more particular manner than an another Person is for this Reason People who have been destroy'd in the Tower or in any other Prisons it hath been esteemed greatly to cast Reproach upon the King himself seeing a Man imprison'd is taken out of his own Protection depriv'd of Power to defend himself and therefore is in the especial Protection of the Prince This was alledg'd by the Lawyers as a great Aggravation of the Crime in the Murther of Sir  Tho Overbury  at the Trial of the Murtherers and especially at the Lord  Somerset  's Trial it was urged that he had exceedingly dishonour'd the King in whose particular Protection Sir  Thomas  then was and the King as might be said was made responsible for his Life because while in Prison he was in the King's Custody Likewise in the present Case of those Persons whom the MadMen mention'd excessively rail at and demand to the Block as they flee to the Protection of the Laws which are their BirthRight so the Government is in Charge of them and is obliged to protect them from every kind of  Injustice and particularly from that Injustice which is founded on the  Summum Jus  of the Law which by the received Maxims of the Law is  summa injuria  If the People who Rail in this horrid manner had nothing to desire but Justice they would not make so great a Bustle on that account For why should they doubt of obtaining Justice It is a great Affront to the King and Ministry now in being that they should make so great Clamours for obtaining  Justice  as if they found themselves in danger of failing thereof and that  Justice  would not take place unless  in Terrorem  the Ministry were told publickly that the People  expect it  implying that the People will Resent it if it is not done I will not give any Credit to that scandalous Supposition That the present Ministry have desir'd these Men to make publick Clamours for Impeachments that they may have it to alledge that they were obliged to do it by the general Demand of the People It is a Scandalous Reflection on the Ministers of State and Merits to be expos'd If there are Crimes sufficient to warrant an Impeachment of any Men in the Kingdom the Ministry have given no ground to any to supect they are backward to do their Country Justice and the directing  B  t  's Libel to the Earl of  H  x  lbeit it is evidently intended by the Youth  s a Satyr upon the known Wisdom and Moderation of that Great Person yet the Effort is so weak and so ill directed that  ike a Mine ill charged it plays back upon the unskilful Engineer and covers him  n the Rubbish and Dirt of his own Design The Case speaks itself If the Ministry had Reason for falling upon the Persons he aims at why should he doubt their doing it  f no Reason why bully them into it with  elling them in a Threatning manner that  he People EXPECT IT from them If  heir Crimes are sufficient to Condemn  hem justly the Persons are not so conside  able as that the Government should not at  empt it if not they are not so inconsiderable as that the Government should attempt  t The using Ministers of State in this manner as  B  t  has used my Lord  H  x    s in so many Words telling them they want both spurring and Whipping too into doing Justice for their Country and that  hey would not do it unless they are frighted into it by the People's Resentments threatned openly in those Words borrowed from a like Author  The People expect it  It sufficiently exposes the baseness o  these Men and shews that it is Blood they seek and Revenge not Justice that they take upon them to call every Action they dislike a Crime against their Country Things which are against no Law they call Treason and demand Men's Heads upon every frivolous Vexatious Pretence and in a Villanous manner  for nothing can be more Villanous  call Men Traitors before they are Convicted of any Treasonable Action  I have said before that the Libeller  B  t  has asserted one Truth  viz  That every Officer is answerable for the Execution of the Queen's  illegal Orders  The Reverse of this Aphorism it is hoped hath the same Authority  viz  That what the Queen had a Legal Authority to Command her Servants might legally Execute and that no Man could be answerable for Executing the Queen's  Legal Orders  Supposing this to be allow'd it was natural to search those  illegal Orders  which the Queen had given and which these Men had Executed and not finding them or any o  them in that Libel the Men seem not to be answerable at all in the Opinion of those who judge of this Man's Libel with Impar+tiality But to descend to Particulars  The first Thing he would have them  aken up for is because there were Riots  n the Day of Rejoicing for the King's Acc  ession No Man approves of Tumults but  as not Justice been done Was not the Go  ernment at a sufficient Charge for a Commission of  Oyer  and  Terminer  to try these Rio  ers at  Bristol  And Was not Justice done  here to Fineing and Whipping Yea Justice was done but there was no Blood Without Blood these Men cannot be appeased and  herefore the late Ministers of State must be taken into Custody tho' it does not appear any of them are concern'd in the said Mobs This is the Justice these Men are for  The next Charge is That Insolent and Seditious Pamphlets have been dispers'd Abroad and therefore the Heads of the Faction as he calls the late Queen's Servants must be seized The  English  Liberty is such Thanks be to God That no Man can be seiz'd and imprison'd without some Crime being Sworn against him yet  his lover of Justice would have these Men seized because other Men disperse Seditious Pamphlets Why not rather the Au  hors ofthose Pamphlets  But the next is the main Charge and of most Weight  viz  The Peace and this it seems is the Treason It is an undisputed Branch of the Royal Prerogative of the Crown of  Great Britain  That the King or Queen for Time being hath the sole Right of making Peace and War and Learned Lawyers say That the King is not bound by any Opinions Representations Advice Resolutions or any thing of that Nature from the People in any Capacity whatever Neither have the Parliament any Right to prescribe the Time the Manner or the Condition If this is not Law then let the raging Authors shew where the Right is and Prove it to be so The other needeth no Evidence it is acknowledged even in Parliament on divers Eminent Occasions which I am able to produce there not being room for it here It being Lawful then for the Queen to make Peace it was Lawful for Her Majesty to issue out Orders to her Servants to do every Thing that was Necessary or which Her Majesty thought proper for that End▪  or can they be made Answerable for exe  uting those Orders which it was Lawfu  for the Queen to give  Their treating by Her Majesty's Orders with any Prince or without the Knowledge of any Allies or Confederate whether it was so or not or whether it was Contrary to Alliances or not is not to Purpose But it must be asked  Where is the Law  they have broken in it  What Act of Parliament  is it against Supposing all was granted which they alledge if then no Act of Parliament has made it Criminal where is the Crime  No  Law  No  Transgression  Is there an Act of Parliament  that the Queen should not Treat with  France  without acquainting the  Dutch Is there a Law  the Queen should not if she could get  Dunkirk  by the Bargain make a Cessation of Arms with  France  That if Prince  Eu  ene  would not come into it her General  hould not draw off from them  Is there  Act of Parliament  That the Queen  hould go on with the War tho' none of  l the Confederates answer'd their Quo  's  c  If Laws can be found for these  hings then these Ministers of State may  erhaps be found Guilty of High Trea  n but if not then it must be otherwise  nd if such Laws are extant why are they  ot quoted by this Lybeller This is a full Answer to every other Charge they make  for all that he Lybels them with turn upon the same Head  Again  Was there any Law  That the Duke of  Ma  should be General That the other Ministry should never be turn'd out That the  Catalans  should be supported at  Great Britain  's Charge after their own Lord had withdrawn from them Not one Act of Parliament is brought which they have acted against and yet he calls them  Traytors  and  expects  their Blood  There remains but one Thing more in his Clamour  viz  Their being  concern'd with the Pretender  Of this he offers no Facts no Evidence no nor Circumstances to make good the Charge which he brings yet  the Blood  of the Queen's Servants must satisfy his inexorable Party and such is the preposterous Rage of these Men that it betrays them to gross Absurdity especially this That they should threaten the present Ministry if they do not impeach  c  ▪ suggesting strongly as before that the Mi+nistry incline not to do it have not Evi+dence to support it and are too sensible▪ that if Justice be done the Accus'd Per+sons cannot be hurt and that therefore▪ they will press the present Ministry to fa  on them  per fas aut Nefas  and to cast them by Number of Voices Whether they are guilty or not guilty  To conclude there seems to be the Height of Malice and PartyRage in all these Things and nothing of Justice is concern'd in it the Temper is hellish the Men scandalous they are a Satyr upon themselves and all good Men abhor them The doing Justice on Offenders none can oppose neither is any thing in this Tract offer'd against it but let not Justice be pretended and the Pretence be made a StalkingHorse to introduce the private Revenge of disobliged Persons or Parties let not Publick Justice be hackney'd out to Men of no Principles this will bring innocent Blood upon the Nation and who knows when the Thirst will be quenched  The King is a Prince of Wisdom and Prudence and it is hop'd he will shew that Moderation in the midst of these violent Extremes as may preserve the Peace of his People and prevent that  Cannibal  Temper which would set one half of his People to devour the other and it is especially hoped His Majesty will take the Church of  England  which he has sworn to maintain  into his peculiar Consideration and inform himself exactly who they are who may be said to constitute that Church Whether the few who side with these Men or Ten Twelfths of the Clergy who as some think is the least of those who are disobliged by these Men  The Affront offer'd by this filthy Li+beller to the Government merits Contemp  ▪ and the Author is no otherwise wort  naming than to let the World see th  Cause by its being espoused only by such  detestable Person  FINIS  This Week will be publish'd  A Friendly Epistle from One of
