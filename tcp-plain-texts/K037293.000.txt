 THE FATAL DISCOVERY A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  Moriens animam abstulit hosti  Tum super exanimem sese projecit amicam  Consossus placidaque ibi demum morte quievit  Fortunati amboSi quid mea carmina possunt  Nulla dies unquam memori vos eximet aevo  VIRG  LONDON  RINTED FOR T BECKET AND P A DE HONDT IN THE STRAND M DCC LXIX  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BARRY  WHEN first the children of the Muse began  To try their magic on the mind of man  Astonish'd mortals saw with wond'ring eyes  The fair creation of the bard arise  Hence is deriv'd the Poet's lofty name  For Poet and Creator mean the same  He from his fancy where the seeds of things  As in a chaos lie to order brings  Worlds of his own and builds the lofty rhyme  Whose polish'd strength defies the rage of time  Such were the bards whom we too call divine  Homer the father of the godlike line  The Mantuan bard whom all mankind admire  For sweet expression and for vestal fire  Shakespear and Milton both in England born  Whose glorious names the Queen of Isles adorn  Who proudly sitting on her azure throne  In arts and empire will no equal own  Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ  And would have been I think awriting yet  Enamour'd of his themeBut I drew near  And whisper'd that of him you wish'd to hear  'Twas difficult he saidin such a case  He could have wish'd another in his place  To tell with what alternate hopes and fears  An anxious Author on the Stage appears  For like the nightingale he hath addrest  Himself to singa thorn at his fond breast  If like the native warbler of the grove  His plaintive notes are full of tender love  Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain  And give him spirit for a nobler strain  KATHUL  My faithful Euran  Those dastards left their master in the storm  That rose at eve my son hath pass'd the night  Alone upon the hill beyond the lake  EURAN  Of him no fear both hill and dale he knows  Cavern and cave and every shelter'd spot  Of the wide forest  KATHUL  Not one moment's peace  Have I enjoy'd since to the Pictish king  I gave my daughter's hand Unhappy she  In secret anguish pines her life away  My son afflicted shuns his father's sight  And in the woods and forests wastes his days  A lonely hunter To complete my woes  Our new ally keeps not his promis'd time  Is this his Pictish faith  EURAN  Doubt not O king  Doubt not the faith of Durstan nor the love  He bears his queenSoon shall you see his sails  Rise on the distant wave white as the fowls  That chase the flying shoalsWhen he arrives  Let not indulgence grant the least delay  But waft Rivine to the Pictish shore  When she has left the place where every tree  And rock and haunted stream recal the memory  Of what she should forget her grief will fly  Like mist before the wind  KATHUL  Rather the mist  Will thicken into darkness Euran my heart  Misgives and chides itself Sprung as I am  From ancient Albion in her evil days  I left her shatter'd side By passion sway'd  And rage at perjur'd Ronan I forsook  The stock of which I came and join'd myself  By strict alliance to her mortal foe  To him whose arm had hew'd her branches down  From deeds like this in wrong of nature done  Observers date commencement of decay  And strange disafter to the guilty line  EURAN  Disaster seize on him who broke his faith  And threw away the pearl of womankind  O could my wish recall that signal hour  When Elig's hall blaz'd with a thousand shields  Of kings and heroes Emulous to please  The alladmired daughter of the Isles  Rivine partial to her brother's friend  Preferr'd the prince of Morven tho' by far  In wealth and power inferior to the Pict  And other royal suitors for her love  Yet he distinguish'd favour'd honour'd thus  Ungrateful man forsook the matchless maid  Without complaint pretence abandon'd her  To wed the queen of Erin  Ireland  In my mind  Most happily for thee and for thy house  Else thou the friend of vanquish'd Albion still  Hadst shar'd the fortunes of a ruin'd people  KATHUL  Not ruin'd yet  EURAN  Expell'd their native land  Their king and more than half his princes slain  KATHUL  Another king succeeds Congallus claims  His right of bloodHere in the bay last night  A rover of the main his vessel moor'd  He told me he had seen on Norway's coast  A fleet immense far off it seem'd a wood  Stretching from cape to cape as if the firs  From their eternal mountains had come down  To grow amidst the waves  EURAN  Was this huge fleet  Prepar'd against the Pict  KATHUL  It was and charg'd  With mighty armies both the kings were there  Of  Denmark  Lochlin and of NorwayOn the deck  Of one the headmost ship Congallus stood  Wooing the winds to fill his hoisted sails  With him a multitude of warriors born  In various climes of the Albanian race  Who though they never saw their father's land  Call it their country too The foremost they  The fiercest in her cause  EURAN  'Tis Ronan's cause  For him the sons of Erin lift the spear  For him the kings of Scandinavia arm  But let them come the pirates of the North  Strong is the Pict and mighty his allies  Who can resist the Romans  KATHUL  By their force  And not his own tho' he is great in arms  The Pict o'er Albion's warlike sons prevail'd  But now the Roman eagle southward flies  The darkey'd chief his legions has withdrawn  To quell the Britons nor can Durstan hope  Their present aid  EURAN  I trust he shall not need  Behold Rivine comes  Looking towards the wood  KATHUL  Entranc'd in thought  See how she tosses to the skies her arms  Now wrings her folded hands Thus is she wont  To wander thro' the woods ever alone  And ever mourning Like a wounded deer  Apart she stalks and seeks the darkest shade  Of hanging rocks and melancholy boughs  To hide and nourish her determin'd sorrow  Let us avoid her O unhappy child  I fear thy father's counsel has undone thee  Exeunt  Enter RIVINE  RIVINE  How soon is evil done The sycamores  The pines whose bulk successive ages rear'd  The tempest of one night hath overthrown  Thou too art fallen thou fair and stately oak  Beneath whose pleasant shade Rivine sate  When first she listen'd to false Ronan's love  O thou expressive emblem of my state  Like thee the chief in beauty and in place  I flourish'd once now rooted up like thee  I wither on the field Daily I die  Delighted I perceive my swift decay  There will I make my grave under that rock  In peace shall rest the daughter of the Isles  Who 'till she's laid in earth no peace can know  No peace for me O how I envy you  Ye lovelorn maids who slighted and forsaken  Yet entertain no motion of revenge  But mildly bear your wrongs decline and die  The blameless victims of inconstant man  Enter CONNAN  Ha does my brother come to see Rivine  What has procur'd me this unwonted favour  CONNAN  Perhaps in prudence and in love to thee  I should conceal my tidings but my heart  Cannot contain them Tho' it make thee wretched  Yet I must tell thee that my friend is wrong'd  Ronan is innocent he loves thee still  He never ceas'd to love thee  RIVINE  I believe it  He never ceas'd to love who never lov'd  But why pretend why counterfeit again  Has Erin's queen found out how false he is  And thrown the specious traitor from her arms  And does he think once more to find Rivine  Free credulous and fit to be deceiv'd  But me he thinks not of he courts thy aid  He needs the valour of his partial friend  A stranger still to what his crimes have done  He knows not who I am he does not know  That Connan's valour guards the Pictish throne  CONNAN  This flash of indignation O my sister  Gleams for a moment o'er thy troubled mind  But darkest woe shall shortly close around thee  I have a dreadful story for thine ear  RIVINE  A dreadful story how can he be wrong'd  Who publicly renounc'd his plighted faith  Plighted a thousand times  CONNAN  He never did  He sent no message to renounce thy love  RIVINE  What then was Valma  CONNAN  An unhappy wretch  The slave of gold gain'd by the worst of men  To work thine overthrow  RIVINE  Leave me to judge  Of my condition Tell me what thou know'st  CONNAN  I need not tell Rivine why I shunn'd her  Since Durstan was her husband I have fled  The human race distracted in my mind  With grief and shame and anger oft my soul  Resolv'd revenge on Ronan Byandby  Something would whisper that we were deceiv'd  That noble Ronan never could be base  Perplex'd with thoughts like these I rang'd the woods  And heeded not the game my dogs pursu'd  The storm of yesterday surpriz'd me stray'd  Beyond my usual bounds nor could I find  Amidst the darkness of the driving blast  A path to guide aright my doubtful steps  As night came on more furious grew the storm  The thunder bellow'd and the lightning glanc'd  Along the dreary heath before behind  And on each side the sudden torrents roar'd  I wander'd on and frequently I thought  The world without was like my troubled mind  At last far in the east whence the wind blew  heard the howling of a shepherd's dog  With lighter steps I turn'd me to the sound  And heard it oft repeated As I hop'd  It led me to a hutI entered there  And by the embers of a fire of turf  I saw a ghastly man stretch'd on a bed  Of sticks and heath compos'd Come near he said  And listen to the dying voice of Valma  RIVINE  Of Valma  CONNAN  Valma whom I had not seen  Since he for Erin with his master sail'd  I found he did mistake me for his host  And silent listen'd with a beating heart  Your charitable cares he said are vain  My hour draws nighGood shepherd you have lodg'd'  Under your blameless roof the basest wretch  That ever liv'd on earth My name is Valma  The favour'd servant of the prince of Morven  My master sent me from green Erin's shore  With tokens and a message to his love  The fair Rivine but a tempest drove  My luckless vessel on the Pictish coast  Durstan the king by promises and threats  Compell'd me to deceive the constant maid  And falsely to report that my brave lord  Renounc'd her loveRivine thou grow'st pale  Lean on my arm  RIVINE  No I have strength enough  Lead me my brother lead me to the place  Where Valma is  CONNAN  At midnight he expir'd  RIVINE  Would he had liv'd one other day for me  O I had much to ask him did not Ronan  With eyes of love behold the beauteous queen  So I have often heard and that was told  Long before Valma came  CONNAN  Ay so it was  Contriv'd and told on purpose to prepare  Thy mind thus tainted to receive the tale  But know for I explor'd the heart of Valma  The noble Ronan in the hall of kings  Who sought alliance with so brave a chief  Fondly display'dhis passion for Rivine  With gems of thine he deck'd his conq'ring arms  And rais'd the song of beauty to thy praise  Such ostentation wither'd the desire  And kill'd the hope of every blushing maid  The hero comes unalter'd in his love  And finds thee  RIVINE  Connan me he shall not find  We ne'er shall meet againwhen does he come  CONNAN  Belike tomorrow or perhaps to day  This is the appointed time the season meet  For enterprize of arms Now the mild moon  Of autumn rises when the sun descends  And at the selfsame hour for many a night  Lifts her fair head to bless with light the world  I mean to share the perils of my friend  Nor shall Rivine as an hostage go  Against her brother's and her Ronan's sword  RIVINE  Would that the swords of both were in my b east  Ye winds that I have wish'd should sleep for ever  Ye southern winds from Etha's mountains blow  And waft to Elig's bay the Pictish fleet  I go to Durstan's kingdom  CONNAN  Go and perish  Hast thou no rage no indignation in thee  No generous drop in thy exhausted veins  Art thou so tame so vile so base of soul  To bear the sight of Durstan Crimes like his  Dissolve all ties Besides his wrongs to thee  He murder'd Valma on the lonely heath  Murder'd the traitor to conceal the treason  RIVINE  Yes I am base and vile my soul submits  To each opprobrious name from Ronan's friend  But I am not so tame my heart is full  Of rage of anger and of mortal hatred  CONNAN  To whom  RIVINE  To Durstan's wife  CONNAN  Renounce the name  And thou may'st stillThy brother will defend  And save thee from his power  RIVINE  O save not me  From any misery But tell me rather  How I may be more wretched than I am  If thou can'st tell Farewel my native land  Ye woods and streams of Elig's vale farewel  Rivine leaves you with a broken heart  To waste her days in horror and despair  With the detested author of her woes  But welcome woe to me Fool that I was  A wretch unworthy of a hero's love  Who readily believ'd a lying tale  Against the honour of the first of men  Then in the cursed hour of jealous rage  Gave up myself to misery and Durstan  Enter MESSENGER  MESSENGER  The fleet so long expected comes at last  One lofty vessel far outsails the rest  And bears the colours of the Pictish king  CONNAN  'Tis well  Exit Mess  Bethink thee sister  RIVINE  'Tis too late  I should have thought before I wedded Durstan  Now would'st thou have me stay till Ronan comes  'Tis not his anger nor his hate I fear  No nor his scorn My just desert is scorn  But hide me rocks and mountains from his pity  As the fond parent to the child relents  When sore affliction lays th' offender low  So would his generous soul to pity melt  Should he behold the ruins of Rivine  Come Pictish Durstan bear me from his sight  To die unpitied in thy hated land  Exit  CONNAN  She's desperateand what will Ronan be  When high in hope he hears she's lost for ever  His words his gestures I remember well  When last we parted at the vessel's side  From his embrace I turn'd me to the shore  His arm he stretch'd and caught my hand again  He press'd it to his breast he wrung it hard  And with a look of infinite affection  Connan he said my king commands I go  To thee my friend I leave my love in charge  Fondly I promis'd to defend the maid  What shall I answer when he claims his bride  She must not go with Durstan O my sire  Thy wrath I fear and not the Pictish sword  But Ronan has my faith Where is my page  So swift of foot Thy master calls thee Calmar  Enter CALMAR  CALMAR  What would my lord  CONNAN  Now Calmar win my favour  I have a message for the eagle's wing  Or the swift pinions of the wind to bear  Exert thy utmost speed  CALMAR  Speak and I fly  Swift as the arrow from my master's bow  CONNAN  Here lies thy way come on and mark my words  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE the Palace of Kathul  EURAN alone  EURAN  I HAVE been sleeping on a hollow bank  Above a flood unfathom'dO those slaves  Who gave assurance of the death of Valma  And boasted each that his good sword dispatch'd him  The blame as yet on Durstan only falls  Would I had never join'd my hand to his  Nor touch'd the proffer'd goldOft have I heard  And now at last believe 'tis safer far  To deal deceitfully with crasty men  Than practise art on unexperienc'd youth  Whose passions sally out beyond conjecture  And by extravagance confound the wise  The passions of this prince are like the wind  The Pictish name is odious to the tribes  Whose hearts still sway to Albion's kindred race  If Connan calls to arms enrag'd they rise  Like billows when the furious tempest blows  The kings have met how shall I warn the Pict  Without alarming KathulHere they come  Enter KATHUL DURSTAN and several Pictish Chiefs  DURSTAN  Excuse my long involuntary absence  Uncertain is his hour whose work is war  Who takes his way across the changeful main  Euran thou faithful servant of thy lord  I greet thee well  EURAN  With joyful heart O king  I see thee in the wish'd for hour return  DURSTAN  Soon must I quit again this friendly shore  For I am doom'd to pass my life in arms  The wandering heir of Albion's vanquish'd line  Congallus threatens to invade my kingdoms  This on the seas I learn'd  KATHUL  I can confirm  The truth of that report  DURSTAN  King of the Isles  I'll give those bold invaders warlike welcome  At eve with favouring tide I sail again  The radiant moon with all her splendor shines  To light my vessel thro' the watery way  Impart my purpose to thy beauteous daughter  And tell the urgent cause  KATHUL  Urgent indeed  Unwilling as we are so soon to lose thee  Tidings like these admit of no delay  But let us spread the feast and raise the song  Whilst yet thy steps are here Sweet to the ear  Is melody and pleasant to the soul  The tale of battles fought and woes endur'd  By chiefs who long have ceas'd from war and woe  We in our turn O King shall pass away  And in the song be found  EURAN  The Queen draws near  Enter  RIVINE Kathul  advances towards her  EURAN  To  Durstan  Stay not the feast there's danger in the hall  Demand thy queen her brother knows too much  KATHUL  Now as becomes thee meet thy husband's love  And look complacent on the Pictish chiefs  Through many dangers they have reach'd the shore  DURSTAN  Cold is my welcome slowly she approaches  Silent and sad fix'd on the earth her eyes  With such reluctance such averted looks  In bitterness of soul a captive comes  Before the conqueror whose hands are red  With her dear kindred's blood  RIVINE  King of the Picts  Thou read'st my thoughts aright within thy breast  Dwells an interpreter that cannot err  DURSTAN  To these injurious words I know not Queen  What answer best belongs Thy gloomy mind  Some foul suspicion of thy husband stains  Changing to hatred and to harsh disdain  That melancholy and that cold reserve  Which I regretted once Unfold thy thoughts  And show the viper that has stung thy soul  She heeds me not Ha wherefore dost thou tremble  And stare so wildly on a stranger's face  RIVINE  to one of the  Picts  Permit me stranger to behold that sword  Trust it I pray one moment to my hand    The  Pict  gives the sword  It is it is his sword I know it well  This jewel once was mine  KATHUL  What means my daughter  RIVINE  Behold the sword of Ronan O my father  Too certain sign the hero lives no more  Is this thy nuptial present cruel king  But I accept it for it suits our love  DURSTAN  Not in the hearing of these gallant chiefs  Whom I would wish to hold thee high in honour  Will I reply to passion Thou hast nam'd  The owner of the sword His it may be  But whose it was I never knew before  RIVINE  Thou can'st no more deceive me The long train  Of treachery and lies the murder too  Has been detected Miserable Valma  Liv'd only to reveal itNow thou com'st  With this proud trophy of thy work complete  O thou sole relique of the first of men  Signal of death memorial of the brave  Companion of my woes perhaps the end  Why didst thou thirst O Durstan for his blood  Hadst thou not wrong'd him was not that enough  But thou didst wisely to consult thy safety  For conscience told thee whilst the warrior liv'd  The robber was not safe  DURSTAN  Thy words are madness  If I had kill'd him was he not my foe  RIVINE  How did the hero fallBy fraud he fell  For he was still invincible in arms  Alone a match for many in the field  DURSTAN  That sword the sight of which disturbs thy soul  Is not the trophy of a hero slain  In evil hour I sound it  RIVINE  Found it where  Was not its owner near  DURSTAN  If he was near  Thou hast conjectured right he lives no more  For where I found it death and horror reign'd  RIVINE  Now I believe thee Durstan Tell me Pict  How when without a master too thou found'st  His sword who never yet was foil'd in arms  DURSTAN  As in our way to thee we crost those seas  Whose rage scarce summer tames a tempest rose  A dreadful one as ever swept the main  All night we labour'd in the jaws of death  But when the morning dawn'd the tempest ceas'd  Red on the troubled deep the sun arose  And shew'd a dismal object to our eyes  Fast on a ridge of rocks a wreck appear'd  Which seem'd the ruin of a noble vessel  Near as our safety would permit we sail'd  And view'd the fate which might have been our own  The ship was broken by the heavy seas  Parted in two and all about the rocks  Dead bodies floated on the tossing waves  RIVINE  Was there no living creature  DURSTAN  No not one  Low are the rocks their ragged tops are seen  And barely seen above the smoothest sea  But in a storm their place is known afar  By the white waves that rage and swell and break  Like mountains o'er them there no man could live  Who'er aboard that luckless vessel sail'd  Embrac'd the same inevitable doom  RIVINE  Was the sword there  DURSTAN  It was About to leave  The wreck we sought some token of the dead  By which they might be known that sword we spied  Caught in the cordage of a mast it hung  And glitter'd through the water  RIVINE  'Tis enough  If at my feet his breathless body lay  I could not be more certain of his fate  In those wild waves the chief of warriors died  To me he hasten'd through the seas and storms  Unknowing of his wrongs for me he died  KATHUL  Forbear my daughter for my sake forbear  DURSTAN  And for thine own O queen respect thyself  RIVINE  I will For ever I renounce thee Durstan  To Ronan's memory I devote my days  Few are the days that of my life remain  Hear me amaz'd spectators ye who think  Rivine has forgot her sex's shame  And judge me with more justice In my hand  I hold the sword of Ronan Who he was  And of what high renown is not unknown  For thro' the kingdoms of the North his name  Flew on the wings of FameHis love to me  And mine to him for I avow my love  My sire approv'dTo him I was betroth'd  But in his absence Durstan did seduce  A faithless servant to betray his master  He fram'd a message from the noble Ronan  Rejecting me and setting free my faith  Then urg'd a fond exasperated maid  And with the help of her deceived father  Precipitated her disorder'd mind  To yield a rash consentThat was my crime  Which I deny not nor refuse to bear  My punishment which like my crime is great  Despair consumes me wither'd like the leaf  Of autumn is my beauty Now I stand  On the dim threshold of the house of darknes  Remorse pursues Rivine to the tomb  DURSTAN  Who with a woman's frenzy can contend  Thou hast avow'd thy hatred to thy husband  And to another own'd thy guilty love  For loss of him thou rav'st  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  King of the Isles  On Mora's top the fiery signal burns  I saw a troop in shining steel array'd  Descend the hill by active Calmar led  KATHUL  Whose hand presumes to light the warning fire  That never burns in peace Where is my son  The feet of Calmar fly at his command  MESSENGER  To war they fly On the highpointed rock  That runs into the bay Connan himself  Stands like a tower His angry voice he sends  Along the roaring waves and shakes his spear  Against the Picts approaching to the shore  DURSTAN  I am betray'd  KATHUL  Of me distrustful too  DURSTAN  The son my enemy I dread the sire  My brave companions whose renown in arms  Rose on the ruins of a greater foe  Than Connan is or those who swell his pride  Now let your valour shine At bay we stand  But not like timid deer  FIRST PICT  Our lives are thine  With thee we conquer or with thee we fall  KATHUL  Some angry spirit hovers in the air  And scatters rage and fury Hear me Pict  Suspicion argues oft a guilty mind  A noble spirit never Sheath your swords  I am your guard in Elig To the shore  I go to quell the tumult and receive  Thy people as my friendsMy daughter hear  Thy father's counsel Never was a child  To a fond parent dearer O Rivine  Much of my hope is lost but do not thou  In rash resentment throw the rest away  Think who thou art the daughter of a king  And of a king the wife the pledge of peace  Among the nations be not thou the cause  Of war and mortal strife thy name shall go  To furture times for good or ill renown'd  The curse or blessing of thy native land  And of thy father's house My child be wise  Forget the past which cannot be recall'd  And arm thyself with patience    Exit  Kathul  and  Euran  DURSTAN  Sweet the voice  Of those that counsel peace Rage was not made  Nor lasting anger for a gentle breast  My soul is innocent of Ronan's fate  And if I used some art against a rival  Ascribe it only to excess of love  Wise are thy father's words Forget the past  And be hereafter happy  RIVINE  Leave me Pict  I hate the present I abhor the past  The time to come Durstan is not for me  I hasten to the tomb There I shall find  Forgetfulness O leave me to my sorrows  Leave me to die here in my native land  Where once with peace and innocence I liv'd  Companions whom my soul shall know no more  Till thou cam'st hither Thou hast made me wretched  Beyond all utterance example thought  Or stretch of fancy When the mournful bard  Seeks a sad subject for the midnight song  He shall reject the woes of other times  And choose Rivine for the tale of tears  DURSTAN  Forbear such fond complaints and henceforth Queen  Think of the duty which thy state requires  RIVINE  'Tis my chief duty to renounce that state  And thee for ever  Going  DURSTAN  Hence thou must not go  I will not trust thee to thy own disposal  RIVINE  Am I a captive  DURSTAN  No nor art thou free  To cast thy husband off Foul shame it were  For me to suffer such contempt from thee  Willing or not forthwith thou must embark  Thy prudent father yielded his consent  Be thou persuaded rather than compell'd  RIVINE  I shall be neither my deliverer comes  Enter CONNAN  CONNAN  Unhand my sister else  DURSTAN  Thou guard'st thyself  By mixing with thy threats a name of safety  CONNAN  My safety Pict depends not on thy will  Behold my force to thine superior far  Calmar  appears with the warriors of  Connan  But fair and equal man to man I meet thee  I use no vile deceitful arts like thee  I take no base advantage of a foe  DURSTAN  Am I thy foe  CONNAN  Hast thou not wrong'd my friend  And dost thou ask if Connan be thy foe  RIVINE  Alas the friend of Connan lives no more  Behold  CONNAN  'Tis Ronan's sword with life and this  At once the hero parted Ah my sister  How came it hither  RIVINE  Durstan  CONNAN  Ha the spoils  Of Ronan by his foe in triumph borne  No tears I shed red are thy drops revenge  Durstan call up thy courage rear thy crest  And to bold defiance boldly answer  I charge thee first with treachery and falsehood  Crimes that strike down the warrior's gallant plumes  With murder next for wretched Valma's death  For Ronan last for Ronan basely slain  By hands like thine he could not else have fallen  With mortal hate I call thee to the combat  RIVINE  My Brother hear me Not by Durstan's hand  Nor by the arm of man did Ronan fall  Far from the shore amidst the stormy waves  Amongst the cordage of a vessel wreck'd  The sword was foundForgiven be my wrongs  And to his kingdom let the Pict return  DURSTAN  Great is thy clemency Permit the Pict  Injur'd defy'd dishonour'd to be gone  Is Durstan's name of such account in Elig  Are these the terms on which he quits the field  Connan thy challenge and thy wrath I scorn  Thy sister as my queen I justly claim  If she's with held I shall lay waste your Isles  And to my kingdom's add one sceptre more  CONNAN  If she desires to pass her days with thee  She is not worth the splinter of a spear  But if her soul reveres her lover's shade  And flies from thee to solitude and sorrow  My sword from insult shall the mourner guard  Thy threats I laugh at thou unwarlike king  To boast of conquest and refuse the combat  Wilt thou not fight thou chief without a soul  Then fly without delay Now make thy choice  Begone or draw thy sword  DURSTAN  Vainglorious youth  Thou fit companion of the boaster Ronan  Whom I could wish this moment in thy place  I'll seek the king If he denies me justice  Unworthy as thou art of Durstan's sword  Expect me soon  CONNAN  Thou wilt not come so soon  As Connan wishes    Exit  Durstan  and  Picts  RIVINE  Why this strife for me  Who should be shunn'd like the infectious blast  Which where it takes destroys Ronan is dead  Let not the friend of Ronan fall for me  I have a refuge sure Behold yon cliff  Whose summit jutting o'er its waveworn base  Darkens the deep below  CONNAN  Fly from despair  And seek the shelter of thy brother's love  The friend of Ronan will protect Rivine  If the pale ghost that dwells amidst the storm  Retains th' affections of its former state  O'er us the ghost of Ronan shall rejoice  To Elig's towers thou must not now return  Come on I'll lodge thee in a place of safety  The cave of sad Orellan now the tide  Retiring leaves a passage cross the bay  RIVINE  To  Calmar  Go to the hall of Elig Tell the maid  Omazia to give out that there I rest  And watch as if she guarded my repose  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE a Cliff on the Seashore with a Cave  RIVINE and ORELLAN  ORELLAN  BEHOLD the habitation of Orellan  For threescore years and ten this rock has been  My dwellingplace and here I sit in sorrow  Silent and motionless from morn to eve  'Till the seafowl that skim along the shore  Fearless alight and sitting at my feet  Scream their wild notes as if I was a stone  Or senseless trunk that could not do them harm  It was not always thus I was not born  To misery nor in the wild woods bred  Of savage race fair was my morn of youth  With thy brave grandsire I was train'd to arms  His chosen warrior and his trusted friend  But love and jealousy surpriz'd my soul  Drove me from men and blotted out my name  This arm slew Namora  RIVINE  Father forgive  My importunity Vouchsafe to tell  What I in part have heard  ORELLAN  My story's old  Thy sorrow recent but to hear my woes  Will teach thee patience Such as thou art now  Or as thou wast e'er grief had made thee wan  Namora was Like thine her beauty charm'd  Contending princes but the generous maid  Preferr'd to princes fond Orellan's love  Daily we met in woods in groves in glades  Remote and secret One unhappy time  Returning from the chace I sought the grove  Ent'ring I saw Namora her white arms  Embrac'd a youth her lips were join'd to his  My bow was in my hand I bent it soon  And pierc'd them with one arrow Ere I reach'd  The spot on which they fell Namora's eyes  Were clos'd for ever The expiring youth  Was her brave brother to his native shore  That day return'd His sister's steps he trac'd  To perish in her arms I kneel'd me down  And begg'd the warrior if he yet had strength  To give me death He heard me not he died  And left me livingThis bleak cave I chose  My everlasting mansion In those days  The hollow shore resounded with my cries  Often the hunter hasten'd from the hill  And oft the mariner steer'd from the deep  And wonder'd at me Time that rage subdued  To milder grief My tears incessant flow'd  Like waters from the rock Here have I mourn'd  An age of man compleat Alike to me  Summer and winter autumn an the spring  And night and day the same  RIVINE  Thus would I wish  To waste my days a spectacle of woe  Without or change or interval I feel  Within myself a source and spring of sorrow  That ne'er will cease to flow 'till death shall stop it  Surely the spirits of the dead delight  To be remember'd and lamented father  ORELLAN  Daughter they domy own experience tells  Once every year that day Namora died  A wondrous vision comes In the still air  For not a breath then stirs the silent bay  Are heard the saddest yet the sweetest sounds  That ever touch'd the ear or heart of man  The melody of woeThen from the skies  Descend the shadows of the murder'd pair  Pale as the colours of the lunar bow  Hov'ring before the cavern's mouth they spread  Their arms they fix on m  their pitying eyes  And with a shriek they vanish into air  Does hoar tradition tell a tale like this  Was ever mortal destiny like mine  RIVINE  Could I but hope to see my love arise  And look on me with pity I would live  In the vast ocean on a rock alone  But Ronan's injur'd ghost detests Rivine  In the dark world of spirits thou shalt join  Thy dear Namora's shade but far from mine  The angry spirit of my love will fly  ORELLAN  I have another charge besides thee daughter  Within my cave a wretched stranger lies  Who tasted all the bitterness of death  But scarce yet knows his wonderful escape  RIVINE  Escape from what  ORELLAN  From shipwreck in the storm  That raged last night upon the rocky shore  RIVINE  From shipwreck ha Is he a man in years  Or of the youthful time  ORELLAN  In prime of youth  And beautiful he seem'd tho' in the arms  Of death upon the naked beach he lay  I found him there Attentive I perceiv'd  That the warm life was not wholly fled  I call'd a shepherd swain to give me help  Who from a neighbouring hill survey'd the deep  He came and willing in his arms he bore  The youth insensible he brought him hither  Within he lies stretch'd on the skins of deers  A sleep profound has seiz'd him when he wakes  He will not know if in a friendly place  Or in the dwelling of his foes he lies  I'll go  RIVINE  Not yet a while  ORELLAN  Thy colour shifts  From pale to red from red to pale again  What dost thou hope or fear  RIVINE  A strange event  Yet like the fate and fortune of my life  Wild and incredible Perhaps this youth  Sav'd from the wreck and sleeping in thy cell  Is Ronan  ORELLAN  No delusive are thy hopes  The various vest and floating robe I know  Of Albion's warlike race He wore not those  His dress is splendid bright with foreign gold  And marks the chieftain of a distant land  RIVINE  Enter and if he sleeps to me return  I will behold and bless him where he lies  Then from his presence fly if it is Ronan  ORELLAN  I hear a noise within the stranger comes  His steps sound on the rock  RIVINE  Now now my heart  Thy moment this  Rivine  retires to the sides      The stranger from the inner part of the cave sees  Orellan  STRANGER  Thou venerable man  Preserver of my life for so methinks  I ought to call thee tell me on what shore  The waves have thrown me For the place imports  Almost as much as life  RIVINE  'Tis he 'Tis Ronan  RONAN  Rivine's voice I am where I would wish  My love is here  RIVINE  Thy love approach me not  Thou noble youth nor call Rivine thine  RONAN  Not call thee mine  RIVINE  No never never more  I am unworthy of thy least regard  Unworthy of the air that Ronan breathes  When thou shalt know what cannot be conceal'd  Thou must abhor me  RONAN  I abhor Rivine  Ah thou art chang'd indeed since I beheld thee  Anguish gleams in thine eye and wild despair  Contends with shameRivine speak and save me  From horrible conjectures  RIVINE  Spare a wretch  Whose heart is breaking Fain fain wou'd I speak  And tell thee how Rivine was betray'd  RONAN  Betray'd to what betray'd  RIVINE  Will not the rock  Fall down and cover with a heap my shame  Follow me not this hoary sire will tell  My crime my misery cannot be told  Runs into the cave  RONAN  It must be so Thou confident of guilt  Perhaps the counsellor  ORELLAN  Young man attend  To every circumstance of this misfortune  And thou wilt pity her whom once thou lov'd'st  RONAN  Tell me one circumstance I ask no more  Is she not wedded  ORELLAN  Listen to my words  And thou shalt have an answer to thy question  RONAN  I have no patience for a tedious tale  Answer at once is she not wedded say  Then I may hear thy story  ORELLAN  It were better  Better for thee rash youth to let me tell  How this disaster did o'ertake thy love  RONAN  Wilt thou not say what the disaster is  How tedious hard and obstinate is age  ORELLAN  Unless I should deceive thee to thy hurt  I can no longer hide from thee the truth  RONAN  Then she is wedded  ORELLAN  Yes  RONAN  Dost thou say yes  ORELLAN  Unwillingly I speak the painful truth  My soul is griev'd for thee  RONAN  Thou art the cause  Of what I suffer Thy officious hand  Sav'd me from death to make me perish worse  My latest thought when sinking in the storm  Was of Rivine of her love her truth  Her grief eternal for her Ronan lost  And now I find her in another's arms  Of me regardless though my faithful heart  Full of her image for her sake despis'd  The beauteous queen of Erin's warlike land  ORELLAN  Young man thou wrong'st Rivine  RONAN  Wou'd that thou  Who say'st I wrong her were a young man too  And strong and valiant to defend her cause  Let me behold the trait'ress and confound  Her guilty soul  ORELLAN  Go give thy passion way  Pursue and seize her in thy frantic arms  Then throw her headlong from the airy cliff  I kill'd the maid I lov'd I thought her false  But she was truth itself  RONAN  And wedded too  But who is he that durst invade my right  What is his name She says she was betray'd  Who of mankind is he  ORELLAN  Her husband  RONAN  Oh  ORELLAN  The Pictish king  RONAN  Durstan my mortal foe  The curst oppressor of my native land  From all mankind has she selected him  Whom most my soul abhorr'd  ORELLAN  She never chose  She was betray'd deluded and compell'd  Thy servant Valma gain'd by Durstan's gold  Deliver'd to Rivine a false message  Cold and contemptuous full of slight excuse  For breach of faith confest and worst of all  Fraught with the praises of the beauteous queen  Whose love had made thee lord of Erin's land  RONAN  Could she believe him  ORELLAN  The bold traitor swore  That he was witness to the proud espousals  RONAN  O villain villain Did she credit this  ORELLAN  How could she doubt it  RONAN  Ha did she not know me  Did not each action of my life belie  The monstrous tale  ORELLAN  Long before that the Isles  Resounded with the fame of thy great acts  In Erin's wars perform'd and rumour spread  Abroad the story of the grateful queen  RONAN  Where was my friend  ORELLAN  When Durstan came to Elig  Connan was absent in the distant isles  His faith to thee this day of danger proves  RONAN  This day  ORELLAN  The fraud of Durstan was detected  And from presumption strong thy death believ'd  Rivine who till then conceal'd her anguish  And veil'd with sickly smiles her broken heart  Then own'd her love and publish'd her despair  With threats the Pict requires his wedded wife  Connan defies him and demands the combat  RONAN  I knew he wou'd my brave my faithful friend  But mine the cause and mine shall be the combat  ORELLAN  The tribes are up in arms for strong the host  That haughty Durstan leads  RONAN  I have no arms  The deep hath swallowed up my sword and shield  ORELLAN  Here is a sword  RONAN  A sword It is my own  Never more welcome to thy master's hand  I'll trust thy temper tried This on the shore  Didst thou not find  ORELLAN  Rivine brought it hither  And bath'd it with her tear  RONAN  Did she Rivine  Of her I must not think while Durstan lives  Father farewell  Enter  RIVINE  RIVINE  Yet stay and hear me Ronan  Behold Rivine prostrate at thy feet  I know I never must behold thee more  And from that certainty derive the boldness  To offer to thine ear my last request  When I am dead as I shall shortly be  Think not too hardly of me By the ghosts  And spirits of the air that wait for me  I never ceas'd to love thee My fond heart  Ev'n when I thought thee false and strove to hate thee  Ev'n then my tortur'd heart was full of thee  Tis this that sends me to an early grave  I could not bear to be and not be thine  O Ronan Ronan when in dust I lie  And thou art wedded to some lovely maid  Worthy of thee unlike the rash Rivine  Then let thine anger cease my fleeting ghost  For ever near thee shall some pleasure know  RONAN  May Durstan's jav'lin nail me to the ground  And may my dying eyes behold thee borne  Aboard his vessel if I do not love thee  Then of my pity judge  RIVINE  Thou giv'st too much  First let the earth receive my lifeless clay  Before thou pitiest me My fate is fix'd  The place is chosen where my tomb shall rise  A little hillock in the narrow plain  Beside the rock fast by the waterfall  Where in my better days we oft have met  un not the place which thou wast wont to love  But come alone come when the mourner's voice  For me hath ceas'd and silent is the vale  Then if thy soul is willing to be sad  Look on my grave  RONAN  Thy grave thou shalt not die  My soul is in my voice forgive thyself  What Ronan has forgiven Speak not of death  Let me not hear thee utter such a sound  Unless thou mean'st to send me to the field  Subdu'd by thee dishearten'd and unman'd  An easy prey to some inglorious arm  The conquest of a coward Dost thou hear  And not reply to this No not one word  But sullen silence and a downcast eye  Thy will shall be obey'd when I am slain  Within thy destin'd grave let me be laid  If the stern umpire of thy fate and mine  Permit so much and thou dost not disdain  To rest beside the victim of thy pride  RIVINE  To what a narrow ridge thou driv'st Rivine  A dreadful precipice on either hand  And I can only chuse which way to fall  I've wrong'd thee much let me not wrong thee mo  Nor come a dark eclipse across thy fame  Go where thy valour bids go in full strength  And confidence let not a fear for me  Unnerve thy mighty arm I will endure  The load of life embrace all shame and sorrow  Rather than thou should'st bow thy noble head  Beneath the sword of an insulting foe  RONAN  Now I am strong  ORELLAN  A nimble foot descends  The winding path  RIVINE  'Tis Calmar's airy gait  Enter  CALMAR  CALMAR  sess  Ronan  come in haste to warn  RONAN  Be not afraid  Believe thine eyes the friend of Connan live  CALMAR  Friend of my master's soul for whom he mourns  prince of Morven like the morning beam  Thou com'st to chace the heavy night of woe  That darkens Connan hasten to his aid  Many the foes whom he for thee defies  RONAN  Where is thy lord  CALMAR  On the woodskirted lawn  Beyond the hill of pines his warriors stand  he Pictish army covers all the shore  aw our aged king tear his grey locks  he implor'd them to forbear the fight  RONAN  Shame to my soul why do I tarry here  Farewell farewell Rivine  Exit  RIVINE  To the field  Rejoicing in his might the hero goes  And so he should from me he parted well  I see I see the path that I must follow  Bright as the starry way that shines above  When the blue frost is beautiful in Heaven  Thy tydings Calmar  CALMAR  Your retreat is known  RIVINE  To Durstan  CALMAR  No but to your troubled sire  Who partial to the Pict his daughter blames  Connan intreats you to forsake this place  And seek the shelter of the inland vale  I am your guide and guard  RIVINE  I'll leave this place  And thou shalt be my guide Father farewell    To  Orellan  The joy that dwells with tender grief be thine  To me alas deniedNo pleasant ray  Can ever reach the dark abode of shame  One issue yet is left  ORELLAN  I read thy thoughts  Hadst thou been silent I had known thy purpose  Thy port exalted thine enlightened eye  Denote the pitch of thy determin'd mind  The stormtoss'd vessel seeks a shore unknown  I blame thee not O daughter of affliction  Strange is thy destiny thyself alone  Can be thy counsellor  RIVINE  Affliction's friend  Devoted vassal of eternal sorrow  Thanks for thy gentle sympathy if thou  Should'st give a tear to me or my sad story  Namora's memory wou'd not be wrong'd  ORELLAN    Exit  Rivine  and  Calmar  Bright star that hastes to set O child of youth  Like the green oak before its head is bare  Untimely torn from some high mountain's brow  So shalt thou fall but not without thy praise  This cave a while the mansion of thy woes  Those hoary cliffs and yon resounding bay  Shall often echo thy lamented name  My voice shall pierce the stillness of the morning  And evening's milder calm bewailing thee  Namora's gentle shade will love the song  That joins her sistermemory to thine  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE a Thick Wood  Enter KATHUL and CONNAN  CONNAN  MY friend is dead But friendship never dies  Remember Sir how Ronan fought for me  The youth were met in the sequester'd vale  And held a feast of joy The bards arose  And sung heroic deeds atchiev'd of old  Rous'd with the song the chiefs began to boast  Their own exploits in arms Above the rest  Proud Armor vaunted trusting in his strength  Truth he regarded not he told how once  In Ardven's vale he met the blueey'd maid  Old Alpine's daughter Connan was her guard  Who shun'd the combat and resign'd the maid  Silent and pale my sad companions heard  But from the banquet generous Ronan rose  And dar'd the giant to maintain his words  By combat on the plain Furious they met  Like two strong bulls contending for the herd  They fought from midday 'till the setting sun  Gilded the vale then Ronan's arm prevail'd  And Armor bit the ground Fast by the lake  Mark'd with a stone is seen his lengthen'd grave  Eternal monument of Ronan's faith  And of his glory but of shame to me  If e'er my soul forgets the hero's love  KATHUL  Ha who comes yonder rushing from the wood  Swift as the roe see at one bound he leaps  From bank to bank the brook Connan beware  His ready weapon glitters in his hand  CONNAN  Spirits of earth and air 'tis Ronan's form  Thus have I seen him hasten to the field  Thus spring exulting when the foe drew near  KATHUL  Oft have I heard the voice of mournful ghosts  Borne on the wings of the careering winds  But ne'er 'till now beheldIt stops and glares  With angry eyes on me Speak thou my son  For ye were one  Enter  RONAN  CONNAN  O spirit of my friend  Com'st thou to urge thy Connan to revenge  RONAN  I am no spirit come my faithful friend  And in my arms feel that thy Ronan lives  Now art thou satisfy'd  They embrace  CONNAN  I am transported  Ronan to life restor'd and at my side  When in despair against his foes I arm'd  I have a thousand questions but not now  I must be sudden and abrupt my friend  The times are soSad tidings thou must hear  But let resentment chase thy grief away  The salve of sorrow is a brave revenge  RONAN  I come to seek revenge my wrongs I know  For I have seen Rivine Where is Durstan  I hop'd to meet him in the battle's front  But peace is here  KATHUL  No prince of Morven no  Peace dwells not here Between the swords I came  Of raging warriors and obtain'd a truce  Until tomorrow's dawn Altho' my hope  Of reconcilement at thy presence fades  My troubled soul rejoices in thy safety  Thy timeless death I mourn'd  RONAN  King of the isles  Why didst thou give thy daughter to the Pict  KATHUL  Ronan I was deceiv'd I hold thee dear  And wishBut nothing can recal the past  RONAN  Recal the past  CONNAN  Ronan  RONAN  Be not alarmed  O King thou art the father of my friend  The father of my lov'd my lost Rivine  And that restrains my tongue Yet I must say  Hadst thou been constant to thy old allies  Hadst thou been faithful and preserv'd my bride  This day had crown'd thy hoary head with joy  Impatient to behold my love I fail'd  And left behind the Scandinavian fleet  Of warriors full With these lerne's sons  And Erin's chiefs for injur'd Albion arm  Selma shall rise again  KATHUL  May Selma rise  And Albion's honour'd race for ever reign  Yet hear me Ronan from my heart I speak  Thou bear'st a noble mind thy fame is great  For justice as for valour with the Pict  Thou hast a rightful quarrel but respect  This hospitable shore contend not here  Nor fight with Durstan for his wedded wife  RONAN  Not fight with Durstan then let Durstan fly  And I shall follow to whatever shore  He takes his flight  KATHUL  I understand thee well  My son do thou regard thy sister's fame  fairer aspect much her conduct wore  When thy lov'd friend was number'd with the dead  Than now when he in arms her husband braves  I go to meet the antients of the land  The hoary counsellors who can compare  The present trouble with the times of old  And call experience to vouch their counsel  Under the spreading beech that shades the brook  They sit and ruminate  Exit  RONAN  Their thoughts I know  Cold are the counsels of inactive age  Patient of injury averse to arms  I long for vengeance and my soul is sick  Of this delay But why shou'd I defer  My just revenge no truce was made for me  I'll send him a defiance  CONNAN  Not to day  Nor yet to morrow do I wish the Pict  By Ronan's hand to fall  RONAN  If he should fall  By any other hand I'm not reveng'd  We're interrupted Ha what man is that  Who steps so haughtily before the rest  CONNAN  It is the Pict  RONAN  I thought so  CONNAN  Yet be calm  Your eyes flash fire your heart beats in your breast  As it would burst your bosom  RONAN  Mark me Connan  This hour let my own spirit guide itself  He knows me not Beware of naming me  I'll take my time to speak  Walks aside  Enter  DURSTAN  attended  DURSTAN  I sought the king  But thou who hast usurp'd thy father's power  May in his absence answer  CONNAN  What's thy question  DURSTAN  A plain one whither was the vessel bound  That left the shore just now with crouded sails  CONNAN  I know not what she is nor whither bound  Why dost thou ask of me  DURSTAN  I do suspect  She is dispatch'd to summon to your aid  The warriors of the isles  CONNAN  Perhaps she is  Credit thy worst suspicion break the truce  And I will thank thee I desir'd no truce  And never will have cordial peace with thee  DURSTAN  My faith young man is plighted to thy father  And he shall own to vindicate my fame  That Durstan sought not to lay waste his isles  Nor stay his people  CONNAN  If thou art sincere  And tender of the lives of blameless men  With me decide the quarrel shou'd I fall  Rivine's dowry is a kingdom then  DURSTAN  Not that I fear thine arm do I decline  To answer thy proud challenge but thou art  The brother of Rivine  RONAN  Wise thy words  And just the reason thou assign'st O King  But I am not the brother of Rivine  And I accuse thee I defy thee too  DURSTAN  Thou who art thou  RONAN  Not less in blood and birth  Than Durstan is of royal lineage born  To Ronan near allied Ha dost thou start  And tremble Pict at injur'd Ronan's name  DURSTAN  Boaster I know no fear but thee I scorn  Who vaunts his lineage and conceals his name  Is of his race the stain  RONAN  Soon shalt thou know  Perhaps somewhat too soon the name I bear  But first I'll tell thee thy detested deeds  And gall if possible thine iron heart  Unlike a prince a warrior and a man  Meanly thou didst seduce a servile soul  To wrong his master's honour and his love  And by the blackest artifice betray'd  To endless misery a royal fair  Who dies of grief and hate to the assassin  And still thou dost presume  DURSTAN  Away begone  RONAN  I will not nor shalt thou from Ronan go  DURSTAN  Thou Ronan  RONAN  I now robber dost thou tremble  Unsheath thy sword Each moment seems an age  'Till I avenge on thee my mighty wrongs  And give thy spirit to the winds of heav'n  DURSTAN  So confident Behold this sword I draw  'Tis stain'd with blood of Albion's vanquish'd kings  To Ronan near allied I lift it now  To send thee to thy fathers  RONAN  Take my answer  They engage  FIRST PICT  Interposing  Let kings with kings contend and subjects meet  A subject's arm  CONNAN  If thou lov'st honour Pict  Or fear'st eternal shame command these men  Thy subjects to retire  FIRST PICT  Should he command  It is our duty now to disobey  RONAN  Let us assail them all  CONNAN  Advancing  Ronan my friend  Step not before me let me guard thy side  Enter  KATHUL  and  EURAN  Kathul  coming between their swords    KATHUL  My guests forbear and thou rebellious boy  Put up thy sword or shed thy father's blood  RONAN  Why dost thou guard my foes King of the isles  What is thine aim This is no sudden strife  Sprung from a light and accidental cause  It is a mortal quarrel founded deep  On wrongs not to be borne Let honour'd age  Avoid the sight of blood  KATHUL  Hear me rash youth  My aim is to be just and to prevent  A combat whose event must fatal prove  To my allies my children and my fame  Do thou hereafter on some distant shore  Pursue thy quarrel with the Pictish king  And bear the cause of Albion on thy sword  Now I forbid the war and will propound  Impartial terms of peace He who believes  His cause is just will readily assent  DURSTAN  Altho' with us the odds of combat lie  Not less in valour and in number more  If full assurance that my cause is good  Implies assent on mine thou may'st depend  RONAN  May my sword shiver when it strikes thy helm  If it does not defend the better cause  KATHUL  Thy soul is like the torrent of thy hills  O chief of desart Morven Fierce thy words  But confident and suited to my purpose  Behold where yonder white and ragged cliff  Points the long ridge and terminates the bay  There in a cave the seamark of the main  A man unlike the rest of mortals dwells  Once great in arms abreast of mighty chiess  The brave Orellan trod the paths of Fame  But strange misfortune crost the warrior's way  In early youth he kill'd the fair he loved  Then left mankind to live alone with sorrow  Bare is his bosom to the howling winds  And wet his hoary head with foam that flies  From the resounding surges of the main  The coot the cormorant are his companions  Sometimes he says his cries bring from her cloud  The pallid image of the murdered maid  RONAN  I know the sad Orellan To what end  Dost thou describe to us the man of sorrow  KATHUL  He is the judge who cannot be unjust  For his pure mind no partial passion knows  The sole affection of his breast is pity  The man of sorrow feels for human woes  To him submit the cause of doubtful strife  And let his voice determine of Rivine  RONAN  Is this thy counsel king and dost thou think  That it will be regarded Shall Rivine  Like flocks or herds in contest be adjudged  No Whilst I live Rivine shall be free  Rivine shall determine of herself  She has determin'd never to behold  The face of Durstan and I will defend  The resolution which my soul approvies  DURSTAN  Art thou the judge  RONAN  I am and thou shalt find so  Follow my steps In such a strife as this  The valiant know no umpire but the sword  Exit  Kathul  stops  Connan  KATHUL  By all the reverence thou owest thy father  And by the love thou bear'st thy native land  Stay 'till thou hear'st the Pict    While  Kathul  speaks  Euran  whispers  Durstan  CONNAN  What can he say  Who still tho' oft defy'd declines the combat  DURSTAN  Kathul I speak to thee In just respect  To thy fair conduct and thy chosen judge  To his decision conscious of my right  I would submit my cause But since the pride  Of haughty Ronan to the sword appeals  I answer himHis challenge I accept  And will to morrow with the rising sun  Meet him in arms Here where we first encounter'd  Tis thine O King to regulate the combat  KATHUL  Durstan I disapprove  DURSTAN  I know thou dost  But thou can'st not prevent It must be so  King of the isles farewel  KATHUL  Tarry a while  Enter my hall and of the feast partake  The hall of Semo shines with many fires  DURSTAN  Fast by my ships upon the sandy shore  I'll pass the night The feast of foes I shun  Oft when the circling shell awakes the soul  Like flints the words of enemies strike fire  Forth comes the hasty steel Whoe'er prevails  A doubtful fame th'inglorious strife attends  Going  KATHUL  Let me conduct thy footsteps to the shore  And shew our people that in peace we part    Exeunt all but  Connan  CONNAN  'Tis not what I desir'd'Twas my prime wish  To meet the Pict and to revenge my friend  Yonder he comes impatient  Enter  RONAN  RONAN  Ha they're gone  What said the Pict  CONNAN  Thy challenge he accepted  RONAN  Did he  CONNAN  He did tomorrow is the time  And this the appointed place  RONAN  Why not today  CONNAN  It is too late sunk in the western wave  The sun but half his glorious circle shews  Soon will the splendor of his path be dim  And his pale sister rule the silent world  RONAN  O thou fair light whose beams rejoice the heart  Of him whose thoughts are open as his deeds  In thy dark chamber do not tarry long  But with unwonted speed thy course pursue  Till the grey eastern cloud grows red again  Before thy flaming steps  CONNAN  My warriors wait  Some care the business of tomorrow claims  An equal number drawn from either host  Must guard the lists Oh were the combat mine  My dearest friend once for his Connan fought  RONAN  When Connan was not there  CONNAN  Go to the hall  RONAN  Where is Rivine  CONNAN  To some place remote  ar in the forest Calmar has convey'd her  Uncertain is the spot and vain it were  To seek her at this hour Turn to the hall  And for my sake speak gently to my father    Exit  Connan  RONAN  I wish I could avoid the sight of him  And every person When the heart is full  Of its own swelling thoughts society  Is molestation Solitude is best  Ye woods and groves where I was wont to roam  With her I lov'd I left you in your glory  Fair as the grove of June I left my love  Not long my absence yet the leaf is fallen  Trees of the forest you shall hear again  The voice of spring and cloath yourselves anew  In the green robe you lostBut never more  Shall bud or blossomHa what new event  Brings this keen messenger  Enter EURAN hastily  EURAN  O prince of Morven  Thy haughty courage and thy upright heart  Expose thee to the snafts of secret fraud  Which Durstan aims  RONAN  At me  EURAN  Of that be judge  Whilst every eye secure of peace is clos'd  Amidst the darkness of the night he means  To bear Rivine from her father's house  And sail e'er morning rise  RONAN  Ha I believe it  This is the secret which explains his conduct  Has he abettors in the house of Kathul  Or does the robber trust in force alone  EURAN  He trusts in me  RONAN  In thee  EURAN  I plant the watch  Which guards the hall of Kathul that he knows  And with immense rewards assail'd my faith  I seem'd to yield and thus the plan is laid  The youth that watch tonight by me assur'd  That they obey in mine their king's command  Seize the princess One bold and faithful Pict  Waits near the northern gate to give the word  And lead them safely through the Pictish host  That office Durstan chose  RONAN  Durstan  EURAN  Himself  Wrapt in the shades of night alone in arms  RONAN  I have my soul's desire ghost of my king  Ghosts of my kinsmen slain that evil day  When Albion fought without her Ronan's arm  Leave the dark mountains where you mourn your fate  Not yet reveng'd and see me meet your foe  Euran whate'er the lavish Pict has promis'd  To tempt thee to betray thy master's house  Tenfold I'll give thee to preserve thy faith  But let no man not Kathul Connan know  The wrong is mine and vengeance is my right  The northern gate what is the appointed time  Of his approach  EURAN  The time that's most remote  From the sun's rising or his setting beams  When o'er the castle red Tonthena burns  Shall I thy steps attend  RONAN  Not for the world  The moon the stars the spirits of the night  They only shall behold the rough encounter    Exit  Ronan  EURAN  There goes the chief whose arm in battle rules  Whose name alone brings nations to the field  Yet simple as the fry he takes the bait  Beyond my hopes this last device succeeds  One night of care then I shall shake no more  Exit  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE a Wood  Enter RONAN  RONAN  TWICE have I made the circuit of the wood  To waste the weary interval and now  Right o'er the castle red Tonthêna burns  Ye fleecy clouds that sail along the sky  Come not too near the moon to spread a veil  Tho' transient o'er her face Lift up your heads  Ye stars of heav'n and light the listed field  Methinks I see the figure of a man  Moving this way within the shade he keeps  A little onward and the shade will fail  'Tis he his armour shines he draws his sword  And resolute advances Here I'll stand  'Till he comes nearer then I spring upon him  Now robber villain Durstan  Runs to the sidescene  Enter CONNAN  CONNAN  Ronan stay  Thy furious arm 'tis Connan bids thee stay  RONAN  Connan what strange encounter  CONNAN  Strange it is  And fatal might have been but let us trace  This error to its source You call'd me Durstan  When rushing on my shield if I had spoken  I should have call'd thee by no other name  RONAN  Did'st thou come hither too to meet the Pict  CONNAN  I came to meet the Pict Now answer me  Who gave the information of his purpose  RONAN  Euran  CONNAN  The traitor 'tis as I suspected  That villain is confederate with Durstan  To you to me he told the selfsame tale  And sent us forth to shock and sink together  Like vessels in a storm  RONAN  It must be so  The circumstances banish every doubt  This is another plot of that dark brain  Whose cruel guile at first o'erthrew my love  Am I a beast of chace a harmless deer  For whom the hunter plants his mortal toils  Himself secure and safe  CONNAN  One silent shaft  Wing'd like the bird of night hath o'er us slown  Another's on the stringif right I judge  Durstan is near and many are our foes  RONAN  Would I could see them  CONNAN  We may feel them first  If on this spot unguarded you remain  RONAN  Shall they not feel us too  CONNAN  My friend be calm  Not far from hence a little to the left  There is a dell whose sloping sides are rough  With thickgrown hazelIn that place obscure  The best and bravest of my warriors lie  Mistrustful of the Pict I plac'd them there  Now let us join them and explore with steel  Each angle of the wood  RONAN  Prince of the people  Valour and wisdom hand in hand advance  When thou dost guide the warlet us divide  Thy band and parting sooner sweep the vale  Exeunt  Enter RIVINE and CALMAR  RIVINE  Did'st thou not hear a voice  CALMAR  It was the wind  f midnight in the trees and hollow rocks  This is no place of safety  RIVINE  Yesit is  place of safety and of rest for me  Calmar begone and leave me to myself  Why stand'st thou motionless Dost thou not hear  I bad thee leave me  CALMAR  Oh I heard too well  I have observ'd the tossing of your mind  E'er since we parted from Orellan's cave  I led you to the forest dark and wild  Full of sequester'd and secure retreats  But you dislik'd each one and roam'd about  'Till dewy night descended on your head  Then all at once with a determin'd tone  You bad me follow you and here you are  Between the towers of Elig and the shore  What sort of rest Forlorn  RIVINE  Dost thou presume  On my distress and am I fall'n so low  That thou controul'st me Go  CALMAR  I must obey  But full of sorrow is the soul of Calmar  going  RIVINE  Farewel truehearted Calmar But thy truth  And loving service are intruders here  The part I've taken I must act alone  CALMAR  I fear her much I'll hasten to the hall  And bring her brother or her father hither  aside  Exit  RIVINE  It is but weakness when on death resolv'd  Fendly to seek for easy ways to die  Yet it is nature Thrice I lifted up  The steel against my life and thrice let fall  Mine arm afraid to strike the fatal blow  I see the oak beside the frothclad pool  Where in old time as I have often heard  A woman desperate a wretch like me  Ended her woes her woes were not like mine  I love thee Ronan love thee to excess  Nor am I less belov'd Who hears me now  Silence and night and death dumb as you are  I will not utter more Ronan will know  When he beholds me floating on the stream  His heart will tell him why Rivine died  Running off  Enter DURSTAN and EURAN  DURSTAN  Stop  RIVINE  Ah  DURSTAN  Again thou'rt found I'll hold thee now  Outrageous woman  RIVINE  Durstan from thy mouth  Reproaches please me best Thou hast o'erheard  A portion of my words and needs must know  I am above thy threats beyond the reach  The aim of human power  DURSTAN  That shall be tried  I'll bear thee hence confine and watch thee close  Lest thy wild frenzy work thine own perdition  Thy shatter'd judgment shall have time to join  And to unite again Then thou wilt bless  Thy husband's lenity which could forgive  Offences gross as thineThis is the path  That thou must walk in  RIVINE  Never will I walk  In the same path with thee  DURSTAN  Thou hast no choice  I have a right to rule theeand the power  Is in my hands I'll use it  RIVINE  Right what right  Deceiver and betrayer of my soul  Hast thou But it were madness I confess  With thee to argue For thy heart obdured  Admits no plea of reason or of nature  But Durstan this at least may comprehend  I am resolv'd immutable to die  And who can hinder me Aboard thy fleet  Amidst thy warriors in the field the hall  In the dark dungeon or the vaulted cell  Alike my soul is free to take its flight  No chains no fetters can the spirit bind  Which makes each instrument of opposition  The weapon of its will Art thou convinc'd  Or would'st thou have me call those horrors forth  Which here inhabit and to thy confusion  Blazon and vindicate my just despair  Tell thee if words can tell  DURSTAN  'Tis loss of time  To listen to thy words    Lays bold of  Rivine  RIVINE  Is there no help what will my brother think  And Ronan when they hear I am with Durstan  Tear me in pieces  Struggling  Ronan  behind the scenes    RONAN  Villain quit thy prey  And guard thyself  DURSTAN  Euran bring up my men  I'll stop his course    Exit  Euran  Durstan  holding  Rivine  with one hand and drawing his sword with the other    Enter RONAN  DURSTAN  Halt If thou dost advance  One step Rivine on the motion dies  RONAN  Inhuman murderer withdraw thine arm  And drop thy point Thou see'st I do not stir  DURSTAN  Keep farther off bend not thy body forward  As if preparing to spring in upon me  And I will talk with thee What would'st thou have  Why comest thou with thy weapon ruffian like  To rob a husband of his wedded wife  Is she not mine  RONAN  No traytor robber no  Fraud is the sole foundation of thy right  And therefore thou hast none If thou dar'st trust  Thy valour or thy cause let go her arm  And in her presence with thy sword defend  Thy title like a man Ha dost thou smile  And mock at me Thou coward thou assasim  Basest of men less valiant than the deer  That graze the hills They for their mates will bleed  And in their sight are bold  DURSTAN  Rage on rail on  Thy ineffectual passion I enjoy  Our nations Ronan ever have been foes  In enmity our fathers liv'd and dy'd  And we were born and nurs'd in mortal hate  Hereditary ne'er to be appeas'd  To fill the measure upThou wast my rival  I triumph'd o'er thee and I triumph now  Behold this woman here is she not fair  Tho' frowardness has somewhat marr'd her beauty  Thou doat'st upon her and she loves thee too  But I  RONAN  Insulting villain  DURSTAN  If thou lift'st  Thine arm she dies  RIVINE  Advance and let me die  For I have liv'd too longAh dost thou shrink  Lean on thy sword and gnaw thy quivering lip  More tender of my life than of my fame  Or peace of mind Thou but prolong'st the term  Of shame and anguish Know I was resolv'd  Tho' I dissembled to appease thee Ronan  Before this dreadful parley not to live  That Durstan knows full well  DURSTAN  I know not that  I know the nature of a woman's mind  Direct in passion for a moment only  And shifting like a whirlwind as it flies  To every point of heav'n  RIVINE  Thou speak'st the truth  I change my purpose now And be assur'd  If I escape from thee I shall return  To him to Ronan to the rightful lord  Of me and my affections Do not risk  By frivolous delay thy dear revenge  Wer't thou stuck round with eyes on ev'ry side  And hung with hands to wield a thousand swords  Yet thou might be surpriz'd strike while thou canst  And disappoint thy rival  DURSTAN  Tho' indeed  I seldom do believe what women say  Yet from my soul I do believe thee now  This rage of death this fury this despair  Are but the smoke and vapor of that fire  That amorous fire which in your bosom burns  Give it the air of hope  RONAN  Curse on thy tongue  What dost thou mean in such discourse as this  Selfloving Durstan to consume the time  Thou can'st not scape from hence Connan is near  With all the youth of Elig at his side  E'er he arrives once more I offer thee  The equal combat If thou doubt'st thine arm  Commit Rivine to her father's care  DURSTAN  Commit Rivine to her father's care  To Ronan's care to her dear lover's care  He will be tender of her and perhaps  May reconcile her to the love of life  Looking to the side scene  Now mighty warrior of thy valour vain  And trusting for success to force alone  I have amus'd thee till the hour is past  The moment of equality between us  For tho' I deem mine arm as strong as thine  Chance might have thrown the advantage on thy side  Behold  RIVINE  Ha Euran with the Picts returns  Now let the spirit of her race inspire  In this extreme the daughter of the Isles  O prince of Morven guard thy noble life  From shame from Durstan this shall save Rivine  Stabs herself  RONAN  O dreadful act    To  Durstan  On thee thou wretch accurs'd  Auther of all our woes I'll be reveng'd  They fight and are both wounded  This to thy heart and thisdown to the ground    As  Durstan  falls  Euran  enters with the Picts and receives him in his arms    DURSTAN  hou hast it too I leave thee to enjoy  hy conquest and thy love  FIRST PICT  Hence Connan comes  They bear him off  RONAN  's deadDishonour rest upon his name  y love my loveHow couldst thouBut 'tis done  hall not long survive thee that's my comfort  RIVINE  hat's the torture which I cannot bear  as prepar'd for death but not for thine  me there was no refuge but the tomb  thee I could not nor without thee live  RONAN  o not speak so tenderly nor look  such heartpiercing eyes  RIVINE  I had one hope  On which I lean'd now I am all despair  I thought when I was dead that from the cloud  Of grief my hero would break forth again  And run his course of glory and of fame  But thou art snatch'd away I have undone thee  Blasted thy youth cut short thy noble life  This is the fruit that thou hast gather'd Ronan  The only fruit of curst Rivine's love  RONAN  O I could speak such things but not to thee  Whose generous heart regardless of thyself  Amidst despair and death for Ronan mourns  'Tis not thy fault Fortune has cross'd our love  But I wou'd rather be what now I am  Than love thee less or yet be less belov'd  RIVINE  Belov'd thou art I die give me thy hand  RONAN  My heart my soul are thine  RIVINE  O best of men  And best belov'd farewel farewel for ever  Dies  RONAN  Flow fast my bloodwhy dost thou linger death  My heart is torn with agonizing thoughts  O memory would I could fly from thee  And give my moments to a softer sorrow  Caught in an eddy up and down the stream  I drive and wheeling to one point return  That monster there that villain land of ghosts  Shall I forget it there  Dies  Enter CALMAR hastily  CALMAR  Alas my lord  Too true the traitor's words  Enter CONNAN with his warriors  CONNAN  Oh Ronan Ronan  O my illfated sister love of thee  Brought down the towering eagle of the war  From his high rock of fame Let me not blame  Pity forbid that I should blame the dust  Of poor RivineBear the bodies hence  Let not old Kathul see his daughter's blood  I left him standing by the corse of Euran  O'erwhelm'd and dumb with grief  Enter  KATHUL  KATHUL  I am the cause  Of all that has befallen Thy father's steps  Turn to his hall no more deaf is mine ear  For ever to the voice of youth and joy  Orellan's lonely cave shall hide my grief  There we will dwell together and decay  Like two old trees whose roots hang uppermost  On some bare mountain's side from which each storm  Wasteth a portion of the mould'ring soil  'Till down they fall  CONNAN  Do not indulge  Such melancholy thoughts  KATHUL  I am resolv'd  To thee my son the sceptre I resign  I trust 'twill prosper in thy stedfast hand  Thou wilt not listen to the tale of lies  Nor in rash mood forsake thine antient friends  Oh friend of Ronan be the peoples friend  Still let thy open gate receive the stranger  Who from the hill or from the ship descends  So shall thy name like grateful odour spread  From thy own dwelling to far distant lands  I have no other wish My son farewel    Exit  Kathul  CONNAN  To morrow we a monument shall raise  To mark the place where mighty Ronan rests  With fair Rivine in the house of death  If right my soul forebodes they shall not lie  In dark oblivion on their buried woes  The light refulgent of the song shall rise  And brighten the sad tale to future times  The brave the fair shall give the pleasing tear  Of nature partial to the woes of love  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  Enters in
