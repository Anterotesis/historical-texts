He must either stand by himself or be ranked among the quadrupeds for there are no other twolegged animals but birds which he certainly does not resemble  C  But how can he be made a quadruped  F  By setting him to crawl on the ground in which case he will as much resemble a baboon as a baboon set on his hindlegs does a man In reality there is little difference between the arms of a man and the forelegs of a  quadruped and in all other circumstances of internal and external structure they are evidently formed upon the same model  C  I suppose then we must call him a digitated quadruped that generally goes upon his hindlegs  F  A naturalist could not reckon him otherwise and accordingly Linnaeus has placed him in the same division with apes macocos and bats  C  Apes macocos and bats  F  Yesthey have all four cutting teeth in the upper jaw and teats on the breast How do you like your relations  C  Not at all  F  Then we will get rid of them by applying to the other part of human naturethe  mind  Man is an animal possessed of  reason  and the only one This therefore is enough to define him  C  I have often heard that man is a  rational creature and I have a notion what that means but I should like to have an exact definition of reason  F  Reason is the faculty by which we compare ideas and draw conclusions A man walking in the woods of an unknown country finds a bow He compares it in his mind with other bows and forms the conclusion that it must have been made by man and that therefore the country is probably inhabited He discovers a hut sees in it halfburnt wood and finds that the ashes are not quite cold He concludes therefore with certainty not only that there are inhabitants but that they cannot be far distant No other animal could do this  C  But would not a dog who had been used to live with men run into such a hut and expect to find people in it  F  He probably wouldand this I acknowledge is very like reason for  he may be supposed to compare in his mind the hut he has lived in with that he sees and to conclude that as there were men in the first there are in the last But how little a way does this carry him He finds no men there and he is unable by any marks to form a judgment how long they have been absent or what sort of people they were still less does he form any plan of conduct in consequence of his discovery  C  Then is not the difference only that man has much reason and brutes little  F  If we adhere to the mere words of the definition of reason I believe this must be admitted but in the exercise of it the superiority of the human faculties is so great that man is in many points absolutely distinguished from brutes In the first place he has the  use of speech  which no other animal has attained  C  Cannot many animals make themselves understood by one another by their cries  F  They can make known a few of their common wants and desires but they cannot  discourse  or communicate ideas stored up in the memory It is this faculty which makes man an  improveable  being the wisdom and experience acquired by one individual being thus transmitted to others and so on in an endless series of progression There is no reason to suppose that the dogs of the present day are more knowing than those which lived a thousand years ago but the men of this age are much better acquainted with numberless arts and sciences than their remote ancestors since by the use of speech and of writing which is speech addressed to the eye every age adds its own discoveries to all former ones This knowledge of the past likewise gives man a great insight into the future  Shakespear excellently defines man by saying that he is a creature  "made with large discourse looking before and after"  C  Animals must surely know something of the future when they lay up a store of provisions for the winter  F  Noit is pretty certain that this is not the case for they will do it as much the first year of their lives as any other Young bees turned out of a live as soon as they have swarmed and got a habitation begin laying up honey though they cannot possibly foresee the use they shall have for it There are a vast number of actions of this kind in animals which are directed to an useful end but an end which the animal knows nothing of And this is what we call  instinct  and properly distinguish from reason Man has less of it than almost any other animal because he wants it less Another point of essential difference is that man is the  only animal that makes use of  instruments  in any of his actions He is a  toolmaking  and  machinemaking  animal By means of this faculty alone he is every where lord of the creation and has equally triumphed over the subtlety of the cunning the swiftness of the fleet and the force of the strong He is the only animal that has found out the use of  fire  a most important acquisition  C  I have read of some large apes that will come and sit round a fire in the woods when men have left it but have not the sense to keep it in by throwing on sticks  F  Still less then could they light a fire In consequence of this discovery man cooks his food which no other animal does He alone fences against the cold by cloathing as well as by fire He alone cultivates the earth and keeps living animals for future uses  C  But have not there been wild men  bred in the woods that could do none of these things  F  Some instances of this kind are recorded and they are not to be wondered at for man was meant to be a  gregarious  animal or one living in society in which alone his faculties have full scope and especially his power of improving by the use of speech These poor solitary creatures brought up with the brutes were in a state entirely unnatural to them A solitary bee ant or beaver would have none of the skill and sagacity of those animals in their proper social condition Society sharpens all the faculties and gives ideas and views which never could have been entertained by an individual  C  But some men that live in society seem to be little above the brutes at least when compared to other men What is a Hottentot in comparison to one of us  F  The difference indeed is great but we agree in the most essential characters of  man  and perhaps the advantage is not all on our side The Hottentot cultivates the earth and rears cattle He not only herds with his fellows but he has instituted some sort of government for the protection of the weak against the strong He has a notion of right and wrong and is sensible of the necessity of controuling present appetites and passions for the sake of a future good He has therefore  morals  He is possessed of weapons tools cloathing and furniture of his own making In agility of body and the knowledge of various circumstances relative to the nature of animals he surpasses us His inferiority lies in those things in which many of the lowest class among us are almost equally inferior to the instructed  C  But Hottentots have no notion of a God or a future state  F  I am not certain how far that is fact but alas how many among us have no knowledge at all on those subjects or only some vague notions full of absurdity and superstition People far advanced in civilization have entertained the grossest errors on those subjects which are only to be corrected by the serious application of reason or by a direct revelation from heaven  C  You said man was an  improveable  creaturebut have not many nations been a long time in a savage state without improvement  F  Man is always  capable of improvement  but he may exist a long time even in society without  actually improving  beyond a certain point There is little improvement among nations who have not the  art of writing  for tradition is not capable of preserving very accurate or extensive knowledge and many arts and sciences after flourishing greatly have been entirely lost in  countries which have been overrun by barbarous and illiterate nations Then there is a principle which I might have mentioned as one of those that distinguish man from brutes but it as much distinguishes some men from others This is  curiosity  or the love of knowledge for its own sake Most savages have little or nothing of this but without it we should want one of the chief inducements to exert our faculties It is curiosity that impels us to search into the properties of every part of nature to try all sorts of experiments to visit distant regions and even to examine the appearances and motions of the heavenly bodies Every fact thus discovered leads to other facts and there is no limit to be set to this progress The time may come when what we now know may seem as much ignorance to future ages as the knowledge of early times does to us  C  What nations know the most at present  F  The Europeans have long been distinguished for superior ardour after knowledge and they possess beyond all comparison the greatest share of it whereby they have been enabled to command the rest of the world The countries in which the arts and sciences most flourish at present are the northern and middle parts of Europe and also North America which you know is inhabited by descendants of Europeans In these countries man may be said to be  most man  and they may apply to themselves the poet's boast  Man  is the nobler growth these realms supply  And  souls  are ripened in our northern sky  THE LANDLORD'S VISIT  A DRAMA  SCENEA room in a farmhouse BETTY the farmer's wife FANNY a young woman grown up Children of various ages differently employed  Enter Landlord  Landl  GOOD morning to you Betty  Betty  Ahis it your honour How do you do Sirhow is madam and all the good family  Landl  Very well thank you and how are you and all yours  Betty  Thank your honourall pretty well Will you please to sit down Ours is but a little crowded place but there's a clean corner Set out the chair for his honour Mary  Landl  I think every thing is very clean What John's in the field I suppose  Betty  Yes Sir with his two eldest sons sowing and harrowing  Landl  Welland here are two three four six all the rest of your stock I supposeAll as busy as bees  Betty  Ay your honour These are not times to be idle in John and I have always worked hard and we bring up our children to work too There's none of them except the youngest but can do something  Landl  You do very rightly With industry and sobriety there is no fear of their getting a living come what may I wish many gentlemen's children had as good a chance  Betty  Lord Sir if they have fortunes ready got for them what need they care  Landl  But fortunes are easier to spend than to get and when they are at the bottom of the purse what must they do to fill it again  Betty  Nay that's true Sir and we have reason enough to be thankful  that we are able and willing to work and have a good landlord to live under  Landl  Good tenants deserve good landlords and I have been long acquainted with your value Come little folks I have brought something for you  Takes out cakes  Betty  Why don't you thank his honour  Landl  I did not think you had a daughter so old as that young woman  Betty  No more I have Sir She is not my own daughter though she is as good as one to me  Landl  Some relation then I suppose  Betty  No Sir none at all  Landl  Who is she then  Betty whispering  When she is gone out I will tell your honour  Loud  Go Fanny and take some milk to the young calf in the stable  Exit  Fanny  Landl  A pretty modestlooking young woman on my word  Betty  Ay Sirand as good as she is pretty You must know Sir that this young woman is a stranger from a great way off She came here quite by accident and has lived with us above a twelvemonth I'll tell your honour all about it if you choose  Landl  Pray doI am curious to hear it But first favour me with a draught of your whey  Betty  I beg your pardon Sir for not offering it Run Mary and fetch his honour some fresh whey in a clean bason    Mary  goes  Landl  Now pray begin your story  Betty  Well SirAs our John was coming from work one evening he saw at some distance on the road a carrier's waggon overturned He ran up to help and found a poor old gentlewoman lying on the bank much hurt and this girl sitting beside her crying My  good man after he had helped in setting the waggon to rights went to them and with a good deal of difficulty got the gentlewoman into the waggon again and walked by the side of it to our house He called me out and we got something comfortable for her but she was so ill that she could not bear to be carried further So after consulting a while we took her into the house and put her to bed Her head was sadly hurt and she seemed to grow worse instead of better We got a doctor to her and did our best to nurse her but all would not do and we soon found she was likely to die Poor Fanny her grandaughter never left her day nor night and it would have gone to your honour's heart to have heard the pitiful moan she made over her She was the only friend she had in the world she said and what would become of her if she were to lose her Fanny's father and mother were both dead and  she was going with her grandmother into the north where the old gentlewoman came from to live cheap and try to find out some relations Wellto make my story short in a few days the poor woman died There was little more money about her than would serve to pay the doctor and bury her Fanny was in sad trouble indeed I thought she would never have left her grandmother's grave She cried and wrung her hands most bitterly But I tire your honour  Landl  O no I am much interested in your story  Betty  We comforted her as well as we could but all her cry was What will become of me Where must I go Who will take care of me So after a while said I to John Poor creature my heart grieves for her Perhaps she would like to stay with usthough she seems to have been brought up in a way of living different from  ours toobut what can she do left to herself in the wide world So my husband agreed that I should ask her When I mentioned it to her poor thing how her countenance altered O said she I wish for nothing so much as to stay and live with you I am afraid I can do but little to serve you but indeed I will learn and do my best Said I Do no more than you like you are welcome to stay and partake with us as long as you please Well Sir she staid with us and set about learning to do all kind of our work with such good will and so handily that she soon became my best helper And she is so sweettempered and so fond of us and the children that I love her as well as if she was my own child She has been well brought up I am sure She can read and write and work with her needle a great deal better than we can and when work is over she teaches the children Then  she is extraordinarily wellbehaved so as to be admired by all that see her So your honour has now the story of our Fanny  Landl  I thank you heartily for it my good Betty it does much credit both to you and Fanny But pray what is her sirname  Betty  It islet me seeI think it is Welford  Landl  Welford that is a name I am acquainted with I should be glad to talk with her a little  Betty  I will call her in then  Enter  Fanny  Landl  Come hither young woman I have heard your story and been much interested by it You are an orphan I find  Fanny  Yes Sir a poor orphan  Landl  Your name is Welford  Fan  It is Sir  Landl  Where did your parents live  Fan  In London Sir but they died  when I was very young and I went to my grandmother's in Surry  Landl  Was she your father's mother You will excuse my questions I do not ask from idle curiosity  Fan  She was Sir and had been long a widow  Landl  Do you know what her maiden name was  Fan  It was Borrowdale Sir  Landl  BorrowdaleAnd pray whither were you going when the unfortunate accident happened  Fan  To Kendal in Westmoreland Sir near which my grandmother was born  Landl  Ah 'tis the very sameevery circumstance corresponds My dear Fanny  taking her hand  you have found a relation when you little thought of it I am your kinsman My mother was a Borrowdale of Westmoreland and halfsister to your grandmother I have heard of all your parentage  and I remember the death of your poor father who was a very honest ingenious artist and of your mother soon after of a broken heart I could never discover what family they left nor what was become of my kinswoman But I heartily rejoice I have found you out in this extraordinary manner You must come and live with me My wife and daughters will be very glad to receive one whose conduct has done her so much credit  Fan  I am much obliged to you Sir for your kindness but I am too mean a person to live as a relation in a family like yours  Landl  O no You will not find us of that sort who despise worthy people for being low in the world and your language and actions show that you have been well brought up  Fan  My poor grandmother Sir was so kind as to give me all the education in her power and if I have not  somewhat benefited by her example and instructions it must have been my own fault  Landl  You speak very well and I feel more attached to you the more I hear you Wellyou must prepare to come home with me I will take care to make proper acknowledgments to the good people here who have been so kind to you  Betty  My dear Fanny I am heartily glad of your good fortune but we shall all be sorry to part with you  Fanny  I am sure my dear friend and mistress I shall be sorry too You received me when I had no other friend in the world and have treated me like your own child I can never forget what I owe you  Enter  John  and his eldest son  Thomas  John  Is your honour here  Landl  Yes John and I have found somewhat worth coming for  John  What is that Sir  Landl  A relation John This young woman whom you have so kindly entertained is my kinswoman  John  Whatour Fanny  Thomas  Fanny  Landl  Yes indeed And after thanking you for your kindness to her and her poor grandmother I mean to take her home for a companion to my wife and daughters  John  This is wonderful news indeed Well Fanny I am very glad you have got such a home to go toyou are worthy of itbut we shall miss you much here  Betty  So I have been telling her  Thomas aside to  Fanny    What will you leave us Fanny Must we part  Fanny aside to him  What can I do Thomas  Landl  There seems some unwillingness to part I see on more sides than one  Betty  Indeed Sir I believe there is We have lived very happily together  Thomas aside to  Fanny    I see we must part with you but I hopeSurely you wo'n't quite forget us  Fanny to him  You distress me Thomas Forget youO no  Landl  ComeI see there is something between the young folks that ought to be spoken about plainly Do you explain it Betty  Betty  Why your honour knows we could not tell that Fanny was your relation So as my son Thomas and she seemed to take a liking to one another and she was such a good clever girl we did not object to their thinking about making a match of it as soon as he should be settled in a farm  John  But that must be over now  Thomas  Why so father  John  Why you can't think of his honour's kinswoman  Landl  Come Fanny do you decide this affair  Fanny  Sir Thomas offered me his service when he thought me a poor friendless girl and I might think myself favoured by his notice He gained my goodwill which no change of circumstances can make me withdraw It is my determination to join my lot with his be it what it may  Thomas  My dearest Fanny  Taking her hand  Landl  You act nobly my dear girl and make me proud of my relation You shall have my free consent and something handsome into the bargain  Betty  Heaven bless your honour I know it would have been a heartbreaking to my poor boy to have parted with her Dear Fanny  Kisses her  Landl  I have a farm just now vacant Thomas shall take it and Fanny's portion shall stock it for him  Thomas  I humbly thank your honour  John  I thank you too Sir for us all  Fanny  Sir since you have been so indulgent in this matter give me leave to request you to be satisfied with my paying my duty to the ladies without going to live in a way so different from what I have been used to and must live in hereafter I think I can be nowhere better than with my friends and future parents here  Landl  Your request Fanny has so much propriety and good sense in it that I cannot refuse it However you must suffer us to improve our acquaintance I assure you it will give me particular pleasure  Fanny  Sir you will always command my most grateful obedience  Landl  Welllet Thomas bring you to my house this afternoon and I will introduce you to your relations and we  will talk over matters Farewell my dear Nay I must have a kiss  Fanny  I will wait on you Sir  Exit Landlord  Betty  My dear Fannydaughter I may now call youyou cannot think how much I feel obliged to you  Thomas  But who is obliged so much as I am  Fanny  Do you not all deserve every thing from me  John  Well who could have thought when I went to help up the waggon that it would have brought so much good luck to us  Betty  A good deed is never lost they say  Fanny  It shall be the business of my life to prove that this has not been lost  TIT FOR TAT  A TALE  A LAW there is of ancient fame  By Nature's self in every land implanted  Lex Talionis  is its Latin name  But if an English term be wanted  Give your next neighbour but a pat  He'll give you back as good and tell you  tit for tat  This  tit for tat  it seems not men alone  But Elephants for legal justice own  In proof of this a story I shall tell ye  Imported from the famous town of Delhi  A mighty Elephant that swell'd the state  Of Aurengzebe the Great  One day was taken by his driver  To drink and cool him in the river  The driver on his neck was seated  And as he rode along  By some acquaintance in the throng  With a ripe cocoanut was treated  A cocoanut's a pretty fruit enough  But guarded by a shell both hard and tough  The fellow tried and tried and tried  Working and sweating  Pishing and fretting  To find out its inside  And pick the kernel for his eating  At length quite out of patience grown  "Who'll reach me up he cries a stone  To break this plaguy shell  But stay I've here a solid bone  May do perhaps as well"  So half in earnest half in jest  He bang'd it on the forehead of his beast  An Elephant they say has human feeling  And full as well as we he knows  The diff'rence between words and blows  Between horseplay and civil dealing  Use him but well he'll do his best  And serve you faithfully and truly  But insults unprovok'd he can't digest  He studies o'er them and repays them duly  "To make my head an anvil thought the creature  Was never certainly the will of nature  So master mine you may repent"  Then shaking his broad ears away he went  The driver took him to the water  And thought no more about the matter  But Elephant within his mem'ry hid it  He  felt  the wrongthe other only  did  it  A week or two elaps'd one market day  Again the beast and driver took their way  Thro' rows of shops and booths they past  With eatables and trinkets stor'd  Till to a gard'ner's stall they came at last  Where cocoanuts lay pil'd upon the board  Ha thought the Elephant 'tis now my turn  To shew this method of nutbreaking  My friend above will like to learn  Tho' at the cost of a headaching  Then in his curling trunk he took a heap  And wav'd it o'er his neck with sudden sweep  And on the hapless driver's sconce  He laid a blow so hard and full  That crack'd the nuts at once  But with them crack'd his skull  Young folks whene'er you feel inclin'd  To rompish sports and freedoms rough  Bear  tit for tat  in mind  Nor give an Elephant a cuff  To be repaid in kind  TWELFTH EVENING  ON WINE AND SPIRITS  GEORGE and Harry accompanied by their Tutor went one day to pay a visit to a neighbouring gentleman their father's friend They were very kindly received and shewn all about the gardens and pleasure grounds but nothing took their fancy so much as an extensive grapery hung round with bunches of various kinds fully ripe and almost too big for the vines to support They were liberally treated with the fruit and carried away some bunches to eat as they walked During their return as they were picking their grapes said George to the Tutor A thought is just come into my head Sir Wine you know is called the juice of the grape  but wine is hot and intoxicates people that drink much of it Now we have had a good deal of grape juice this morning and yet I do not feel heated nor does it seem at all to have got into our heads What is the reason of this  Tut  The reason is that grapejuice is not wine though wine is made from it  G  Pray how is it made then  T  I will tell you for it is a matter worth knowing The juice pressed from grapes called  must  is at first a sweet watery liquor with a little tartness but with no strength or spirit After it has stood a while it begins to grow thick and muddy it moves up and down and throws scum and bubbles of air to the surface This is called  working  or  fermenting  It continues in this state for some time more or less according to the quality of the juice and the temperature of the weather and  then gradually settles again becoming clearer than at first It has now lost its sweet flat taste and acquired a briskness and pungency with a heating and intoxicating property that is it has become  wine  This natural process is called the  vinous fermentation  and many liquors besides grape juice are capable of undergoing it  G  I have heard of the working of beer and ale Is that of the same kind  T  It is and beer and ale may properly be called barleywine for you know they are clear brisk and intoxicating In the same manner cyder is applewine and mead is honeywine and you have heard of raisin and currant wine and a great many others  Har  Yes there is elderwine and cowslipwine and orangewine  G  Will every thing of that sort make wine  T  All vegetable juices that are sweet  are capable of fermenting and of producing a liquor of a vinous nature but if they have little sweetness the liquor is proportionally weak and poor and is apt to become sour or vapid  H  But barley is not sweet  T  Barley as it comes from the ear is not but before it is used for brewing it is made into  malt  and then it is sensibly sweet You know what malt is  H  I have seen heaps of it in the malthouse but I do not know how it is made  T  Barley is made malt by putting it in heaps and wetting it when it becomes hot and swells and would sprout out just as if it were sown unless it were then dried in a kiln By this operation it acquires a sweet taste You have drunk sweetwort  H  Yes  T  Wellthis is made by steeping malt in hot water The water extracts and dissolves all the sweet or sugary  part of the malt It then becomes like a naturally sweet juice  G  Would not sugar and water then make wine  T  It would and the wines made in England of our common fruits and flowers have all a good deal of sugar in them Cowslip flowers for example give little more than the flavour to the wine named from them and it is the sugar added to them which properly makes the wine  G  But none of these wines are so good as grapewine  T  No The grape from the richness and abundance of its juice is the fruit universally preferred for making wine where it comes to perfection which it seldom does in our climate except by means of artificial heat  H  I suppose then grapes are finest in the hottest countries  T  Not so neither they are properly a fruit of the temperate zone and  do not grow well between the tropics And in very hot countries it is scarcely possible to make wines of any kind to keep for they ferment so strongly as to turn sour almost immediately  G  I think I have read of palmwine on the coast of Guinea  T  Yes A sweet juice flows abundantly from incisions in certain species of the palm which ferments immediately and makes a very pleasant sort of weak wine But it must be drunk the same day it is made for on the next it is as sour as vinegar  G  What is vinegaris it not sour wine  T  Every thing that makes wine will make vinegar also and the stronger the wine the stronger the vinegar The vinous fermentation must be first brought on but it need not produce perfect wine for when the intention is to make vinegar the liquor is kept still warm and it goes on without stopping to another  kind of fermentation called the  acetous  the product of which is vinegar  G  I have heard of alegar I suppose that is vinegar made of ale  T  It isbut as ale is not so strong as wine the vinegar made from it is not so sharp or perfect But housewives make good vinegar with sugar and water  H  Will vinegar make people drunk if they take too much of it  T  No The wine loses its intoxicating quality as well as its taste on turning to vinegar  G  What are spirituous liquorshave not they something to do with wine  T  Yes They consist of the spirituous or intoxicating part of wine separated from the rest You may remember that on talking of distillation I told you that it was the raising of a liquor in steam or vapour and condensing it again and that some liquors were more  easily turned to vapour than others and were therefore called more volatile or evaporable Now wine is a mixed or compound liquor of which the greater part is water but what heats and intoxicates is  vinous spirit  This spirit being much more volatile than water on the application of a gentle heat flies off in vapour and may be collected by itself in distilling vesselsand thus are made spirituous liquors  G  Will every thing that you called wine yield spirits  T  Yes every thing that has undergone the vinous fermentation Thus in England a great deal of maltspirit is made from a kind of wort brought into fermentation and then set directly to distil without first making ale or beer of it Gin is a spirituous liquor also got from corn and flavoured with juniper berries Even potatoes carrots and turneps may be made to afford spirits by first fermenting their  juices In the West Indies rum is distilled from the dregs of the sugar canes washed out by water and fermented But brandy is distilled from the fermented juice of the grape and is made in the wine countries  G  Is spirits of wine different from spirituous liquors  T  It is the strongest part of them got by distilling over again for all these still contain a good deal of water along with a pure spirit which may be separated by a gentler heat than was used at first But in order to procure this as strong and pure as possible it must be distilled several times over always leaving some of the watery part behind When perfectly pure it is the same whatever spirituous liquor it is got from  H  My mamma has little bottles of lavender water What is that  T  It is spirit of wine flavoured with lavender flowers and it may in like manner be flavoured with many other  fragrant things since their odoriferous part is volatile and will rise in vapour along with the spirit  H  Will not spirits of wine burn violently  G  That it will I can tell you and so will rum and brandy for you know it was set on fire when we made snapdragon  T  All spirituous liquors are highly inflammable and the more so the purer they are One way of trying the purity of spirit is to see if it will burn all away without leaving any moisture behind Then it is much lighter than water and that affords another way of judging of its strength A hollow ivory ball is set to swim in it and the deeper it sinks down the lighter and therefore the more spirituous is the liquor  G  I have heard much of the mischief done by spirituous liquorspray what good do they do  T  The use and abuse of wine and  spirits is a very copious subject and there is scarcely any gift of human art the general effects of which are more dubious You know what wine is said to be given for in the bible  G  To make glad the heart of man  T  Right And nothing has such an immediate effect in inspiring vigour of body and mind as wine It banishes sorrow and care recruits from fatigue enlivens the fancy inflames the courage and performs a hundred fine things of which I could bring you abundant proof from the poets The physicians too speak almost as much in its favour both in diet and medicine But its really good effects are only when used in moderation and it unfortunately is one of those things which man can hardly be brought to use moderately Excess in wine brings on effects the very contrary to its benefits It stupifies and enfeebles the mind and fills the body with incurable diseases And this it does even  when used without intoxication But a drunken man loses for the time every distinction of a reasonable creature and becomes worse than a brute beast On this account Mahomet entirely forbid its use to his followers and to this day it is not publicly drunk in any of the countries that receive the Mahometan religion  H  Was not that right  T  I think not If we were entirely to renounce every thing that may be misused we should have scarce any enjoyments left and it is a proper exercise of our strength of mind to use good things with moderation when we have it in our power to do otherwise  G  But spirituous liquors are not good at all are they  T  They have so little good and so much bad in them that I confess I wish their common use could be abolished altogether They are generally taken by the lowest class of people for the express  purpose of intoxication and they are much sooner prejudicial to the health than wine and indeed when drunk unmixed are no better than slow poison  G  Spirit of wine is useful though for several thingsis it not  T  Yes and I would have all spirits kept in the hands of chymists and artists who know how to employ them usefully Spirit of wine will dissolve many things that water will not Apothecaries use them in drawing tinctures and artists in preparing colours and making varnishes They are likewise very powerful preservatives from corruption You may have seen serpents and insects brought from abroad in phials full of spirits  G  I have  H  And I know of another use of spirits  T  What is that  H  To burn in lamps My grandmamma has a teakettle with a lamp  under it to keep the water hot and she burns spirits in it  T  So she does Wellso much for the uses of these liquors  G  But you have said nothing about ale and beer Are they wholesome  T  Yes in moderation But they are sadly abused too and rob many men of their health as well as their money and senses  G  Small beer does no harm however  T  Noand we will indulge in a good draught of it when we get home  H  I like water better  T  Then drink it by all means He that is satisfied with water has one want the less and may defy thirst in this country at least  THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS  MR Wiseman the schoolmaster at the end of his summer vacation received a new scholar with the following letter  SIR  THIS will be delivered to you by my son Samuel whom I beg leave to commit to your care hoping that by your wellknown skill and attention you will be able to make something of him which I am sorry to say none of his masters have hitherto done He is now eleven and yet can do nothing but read his mother tongue and that but indifferently We sent him at seven to a grammar school in our neighbourhood but his master soon found that his genius was not turned to learning languages He was then put to writing but he set about it so awkwardly that he made nothing of it He  was tried at accounts but it appeared that he had no genius for that neither He could do nothing in geography for want of memory In short if he has any genius at all it does not yet shew itself But I trust to your experience in cases of this nature to discover what he is fit for and to instruct him accordingly I beg to be favoured shortly with your opinion about him and remain Sir  Your most obedient servant HUMPHRY ACRES  When Mr Wiseman had read his letter he shook his head and said to his assistant A pretty subject they have sent us here a lad that has a great genius for nothing at all But perhaps my friend Mr Acres expects that a boy should show a genius for a thing before he knows any thing about itno uncommon error Let us see however  what the youth looks like I suppose he is a human creature at least  Master Samuel Acres was now called in He came hanging down his head and looking as if he was going to be flogged  Come hither my dear said Mr WisemanStand by me and do not be afraid Nobody will hurt you How old are you  Eleven last May Sir  A wellgrown boy of your age indeed You love play I dare say  Yes Sir  What are you a good hand at marbles  Pretty good Sir  And can spin a top and drive a hoop I suppose  Yes Sir  Then you have the full use of your hands and fingers  Yes Sir  Can you write Samuel  I learned a little Sir but I left it off again  And why so  Because I could not make the letters  No Why how do you think other boys dohave they more fingers than you  No Sir  Are you not able to hold a pen as well as a marble  Samuel was silent  Let me look at your hand  Samuel held out both his paws like a dancing bear  I see nothing here to hinder you from writing as well as any boy in the school You can read I suppose  Yes Sir  Tell me then what is written over the schoolroom door  Samuel with some hesitation read  WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE MAN MAY DO  Pray how did you learn to readWas it not with taking pains  Yes Sir  Welltaking more pains will enable you to read better Do you know any thing of the Latin grammar  No Sir  Have you never learned it  I tried Sir but I could not get it by heart  Why you can say some things by heart I dare say you can tell me the names of the days of the week in their order  Yes Sir I know them  And the months in the year perhaps  Yes Sir  And you could probably repeat the names of your brothers and sisters and all your father's servants and half the people in the village besides  I believe I could Sir  Welland is  hic haec hoc  more difficult to remember than these  Samuel was silent  Have you learned any thing of accounts  I went into addition Sir but I did not go on with it  Why so  I could not do it Sir  How many marbles can you buy for a penny  Twelve new ones Sir  And how many for a halfpenny  Six  And how many for twopence  Twentyfour  If you were to have a penny a day what would that make in a week  Sevenpence  But if you paid twopence out of that what would you have left  Samuel studied awhile and then said fivepence  Right Why here you have been practising the four great rules of arithmetic  addition subtraction multiplication and division Learning accounts is no more than this Well Samuel I see what you are fit for I shall set you about nothing but what you are able to do but observe you  must  do it We have no  I can't  here Now go among your schoolfellows  Samuel went away glad that his examination was over and with more confidence in his powers than he had felt before  The next day he began business A boy less than himself was called out to set him a copy of letters and another was appointed to hear him grammar He read a few sentences in English that he could perfectly understand to the master himself Thus by going on steadily and slowly he made a sensible progress He had already joined his letters got all the declensions perfectly and half the multiplication table  when Mr Wiseman thought it time to answer his father's letter which he did as follows  SIR  I now think it right to give you some information concerning your son You perhaps expected it sooner but I always wish to avoid hasty judgments You mentioned in your letter that it had not yet been discovered which way his genius pointed If by  genius  you meant such a decided bent of mind to any one pursuit as will lead to excel with little or no labour or instruction I must say that I have not met with such a quality in more than three or four boys in my life and your son is certainly not among the number But if you mean only the  ability  to do some of those things which the greater part of mankind can do when properly taught I can affirm that I find in him no peculiar deficiency And whether you choose to bring him up to trade or to some  practical profession I see no reason to doubt that he may in time become sufficiently qualified for it It is my favourite maxim Sir that every thing most valuable in this life may generally be acquired by taking pains for it Your son has already lost much time in the fruitless expectation of finding out what he would take up of his own accord Believe me Sir few boys will take up any thing of their own accord but a top or a marble I will take care while he is with me that he loses no more time this way but is employed about things that are fit for him not doubting that we shall find him fit for them  I am Sir yours c SOLON WISEMAN  Though the doctrine of this letter did not perfectly agree with Mr Acres's notions yet being convinced that Mr Wiseman was more likely to make something of his son than any of his  former preceptors he continued him at this school for some years and had the satisfaction to find him going on in a steady course of gradual improvement In due time a profession was chosen for him which seemed to suit his temper and talents but for which he had no  particular turn  having never thought at all about it He made a respectable figure in it and went through the world with credit and usefulness though  without a genius  HALFACROWN'S WORTH  VALENTINE was in his thirteenth year and a scholar in one of our great schools He was a welldisposed boy but could not help envying a little some of his companions who had a larger allowance of money than himself He ventured in a letter to sound his father on the subject not directly asking for  a particular sum but mentioning that many of the boys in his class had halfacrown a week for pocketmoney  His father who did not choose to comply with his wishes for various reasons nor yet to refuse him in a mortifying manner wrote an answer the chief purpose of which was to make him sensible what sort of a sum halfacrown a week was and to how many more important uses it might be put than to provide a schoolboy with things absolutely superfluous to him  It is calculated said he that a grown man may be kept in health and fit for labour upon a pound and a half of good bread a day Suppose the value of this to be twopence halfpenny and add a penny for a quart of milk which will greatly improve his diet Halfacrown will keep him eight or nine days in this manner  A common labourer's wages in our county are seven shillings per week  and if you add somewhat extraordinary for harvest work this will not make it amount to three halfcrowns on an average the year round Suppose his wife and children to earn another halfcrown For this ten shillings per week he will maintain himself his wife and halfadozen children in food lodging clothes and fuel A halfcrown then may be reckoned the full weekly maintenance of two human creatures in every thing necessary  Where potatoes are much cultivated two bushels weighing eighty pounds a piece may be purchased for halfacrown Here is one hundred and sixty pounds of solid food of which allowing for the waste in dressing you may reckon two pounds and a half sufficient for the sole daily nourishment of one person At this rate nine people might be fed a week for halfacrown poorly indeed but so as many thousands are fed  with the addition of a little salt or buttermilk  If the father of a numerous family were out of work or the mother lyingin a parish would think halfacrown a week a very ample assistance to them  Many of the cottagers round us would receive with great thankfulness a sixpenny loaf per week and reckon it a very material addition to their children's bread For halfacrown therefore you might purchasethe weekly blessings of five poor families  Porter is a sort of luxury to a poor man but not an useless one since it will stand in the place of some solid food and enable him to work with better heart You could treat a hardworking man with a quart a day of this liquor for a fortnight with halfacrown  Many a cottage in the country inhabited by a large family is let for forty shillings a year Halfacrown a week  would pay the full rent of three such cottages and allow somewhat over for repairs  The usual price for schooling at a dameschool in a village is twopence a week You might therefore get fifteen children instructed in reading and the girls in sewing for halfacrown weekly But even in a town you might get them taught reading writing and accounts and so fitted for any common trade for five shillings a quarter and therefore halfacrown a week would keep six children at such a school and provide them with books besides  All these are ways in which halfacrown a week might be made to do a great deal of good to  others  I shall now just mention one or two ways of laying it out with advantage to yourself  I know you are very fond of coloured plates of plants and other objects of natural history There are now several  works of this sort publishing in monthly numbers as the Botanical Magazine the English Botany the Flora Rustica and the Naturalist's Magazine Now halfacrown a week would reach the purchase of all the best of these  The same sum laid out in the old book shops in London would buy you more classics and pretty editions too in one year than you could read in five  Now I do not grudge laying out halfacrown a week upon you but when so many good things for yourself and others may be done with it I am unwilling you should squander it away like your schoolfellows in tarts and trinkets  THE RAT WITH A BELL  A FABLE  A large old house in the country was so extremely infested with rats that nothing  could be secured from their depredations They scaled the walls to attack flitches of bacon though hung as high as the ceiling Hangingshelves afforded no protection to the cheese and pastry They penetrated by sap into the storeroom and plundered it of preserves and sweetmeats They gnawed through cupboard doors undermined floors and ran races behind the wainscots The cats could not get at them they were too cunning and too well fed to meddle with poison and traps only now and then caught a heedless straggler One of these however on being taken was the occasion of practising a new device This was to fasten a collar with a small bell about the prisoner's neck and then turn him loose again  Overjoyed at the recovery of his liberty the rat ran into the nearest hole and went in search of his companions They heard at a distance the bell tinkle  tinkle through the dark passages and suspecting some enemy had got among them away they scoured some one way and some another The bellbearer pursued and soon guessing the cause of their flight he was greatly amused by it Wherever he approached it was all hurryscurry and not a tail of one of them was to be seen He chased his old friends from hole to hole and room to room laughing all the while at their fears and increasing them by all the means in his power Presently he had the whole house to himself  "That's right quoth hethe fewer the better cheer"  So he rioted alone among the good things and stuffed till he could hardly walk  For two or three days this course of life went on very pleasantly He eat and eat and played the bugbear to perfection At length he grew tired of this lonely condition and longed to mix with his companions again upon  the former footing But the difficulty was how to get rid of his bell He pulled and tugged with his forefeet and almost wore the skin off his neck in the attempt but all in vain The bell was now his plague and torment He wandered from room to room earnestly desiring to make himself known to one of his companions but they all kept out of his reach At last as he was moping about disconsolate he fell in puss's way and was devoured in an instant  He who is raised so much above his fellow creatures as to be the object of their terror must suffer for it in losing all the comforts of society He is a solitary being in the midst of crowds He keeps them at a distance and they equally shun him Dread and affection cannot subsist together  THIRTEENTH EVENING  TRIAL  This was meant as a sequel of that very pleasing and ingenious little work entitled  Juvenile Trials  in which a court of justice is supposed to be instituted in a boardingschool composed of the scholars themselves for the purpose of trying offences committed at school  Of a Complaint made against sundry Persons for breaking the Windows of DOROTHY CAREFUL Widow and Dealer in Gingerbread  THE court being sat there appeared in person the Widow  Dorothy Careful  to make a complaint against  Henry Luckless  and other person or persons unknown for breaking three panes of glass value ninepence in the house of the said widow Being directed to tell her case to the court she made a curtsey and began as follows  "Please your lordship I was sitting  at work by my fireside between the hours of six and seven in the evening just as it was growing dusk and little Jack was spinning beside me when all at once crack went the window and down fell a little basket of cakes that was set up against it I started up and cried to Jack Bless me what's the matter So says Jack Somebody has thrown a stone and broke the window and I dare say it is some of the schoolboys With that I ran out of the house and saw some boys making off as fast as they could go So I ran after them as quick as my old legs would carry me but I should never have come near them if one had not happened to fall down Him I caught and brought back to my house when Jack knew him at once to be Master Harry Luckless So I told him I would complain of him the next day and I hope your worship will make him pay the damage and I think he deserves a good whipping  into the bargain for injuring a poor widow woman"  The Judge having heard Mrs Careful's story desired her to sit down and then calling up Master Luckless asked him what he had to say for himself Luckless appeared with his face a good deal scratched and looking very ruefully After making his bow and sobbing two or three times he said  "My lord I am as innocent of this matter as any boy in the school and I am sure I have suffered enough about it already My lord Billy Thompson and I were playing in the lane near Mrs Careful's house when we heard the window crash and directly after she came running out towards us Upon this Billy ran away and I ran too thinking I might bear the blame But after running a little way I stumbled over something that lay in the road and before I could get up again she overtook me and caught me by the  hair and began lugging and cuffing me I told her it was not I that broke her window but it did not signify so she dragged me to the light lugging and scratching me all the while and then said she would inform against me and that is all I know of the matter"  Judge  I find good woman you were willing to revenge yourself without waiting for the justice of this court  Widow Careful  My lord I confess I was put into a passion and did not properly consider what I was doing  Judge  Well where is Billy Thompson  Billy  Here my lord  Judge  You have heard what Harry Luckless says Declare upon your honour whether he has spoken the truth  Billy  My lord I am sure neither he nor I had any concern in breaking the windows We were standing together at the time and I ran on hearing the door open for fear of being charged  with it and he followed But what became of him I did not stay to see  Judge  So you let your friend shift for himself and only thought of saving yourself But did you see any other person about the house or in the lane  Billy  My lord I thought I heard somebody on the other side of the hedge creeping along a little before the window was broken but I saw nobody  Judge  You hear good woman what is alledged in behalf of the person you have accused Have you any other evidence against him  Widow Careful  One might be sure that they would deny it and tell lies for one another but I hope I am not to be put off in that manner  Judge  I must tell you mistress that you give too much liberty to your tongue and are guilty of as much injustice as that of which you complain I should be sorry indeed if the young gentlemen of this school deserved  the general character of liars You will find among us I hope as just a sense of what is right and honourable as among those who are older and our worthy master certainly would not permit us to try offences in this manner if he thought us capable of bearing false witness in each other's favour  Widow Careful  I ask your lordship's pardon I did not mean to offend but it is a heavy loss for a poor woman and though I did not catch the boy in the fact he was the nearest when it was done  Judge  As that is no more than a suspicion and he has the positive evidence of his schoolfellow in his favour it will be impossible to convict him consistently with the rules of justice Have you discovered any other circumstance that may point out the offender  Widow Careful  My lord next morning Jack found on the floor this top  which I suppose the window was broke with  Judge  Hand it upHere gentlemen of the jury please to examine it and see if you can discover any thing of its owner  Juryman  Here is P R cut upon it  Another  Yes and I am sure I recollect Peter Riot's having just such an one  Another  So do I  Judge  Master Riot is this your top  Riot  I don't know my lord perhaps it may be mine I have had a great many tops and when I have done with them I throw them away and any body may pick them up that pleases You see it has lost its peg  Judge  Very well sir Mrs Careful you may retire  Widow Careful  And must I have no amends my lord  Judge  Have patience Leave every thing to the court We shall do you  all the justice in our power As soon as the widow was gone the Judge rose from his seat and with much solemnity thus addressed the assembly  Gentlementhis business I confess gives me much dissatisfaction A poor woman has been insulted and injured in her property apparently without provocation and though she has not been able to convict the offender it cannot be doubted that she as well as the world in general will impute the crime to some of our society Though I am in my own mind convinced that in her passion she charged an innocent person yet the circumstance of the top is a strong suspicion indeed almost a proof that the perpetrator of this unmanly mischief was one of our body The owner of the top has justly observed that its having been his property is no certain proof against him Since therefore in the present defect of evidence the whole school must remain burthened  with the discredit of this action and share in the guilt of it I think fit in the first place to decree that restitution shall be made to the sufferer out of the public chest and next that a court of enquiry be instituted for the express purpose of searching thoroughly into this affair with power to examine all persons upon honour who are thought likely to be able to throw light upon it I hope gentlemen these measures meet with your concurrence  The whole court bowed to the Judge and expressed their entire satisfaction with his determination  It was then ordered that the public treasurer should go to the Widow Careful's house and pay her the sum of one shilling making at the same time a handsome apology in the name of the school And six persons were taken by lot out of the jury to compose the court of enquiry which was to sit in the evening  The court then adjourned  On the meeting of the court of enquiry the first thing proposed by the President was that the persons who usually played with Master Riot should be sent for Accordingly Tom Frisk and Bob Loiter were summoned when the President asked them upon their honour if they knew the top to have been Riot's They said they did They were then asked whether they remembered when Riot had it in his possession  Frisk  He had it the day before yesterday and split a top of mine with it  Loiter  Yes and then as he was making a stroke at mine the peg flew out  Presid  What did he then do with it  Frisk  He put it into his pocket and said as it was a strong top he would have it mended  Presid  Then he did not throw it away or give it to any body  Loiter  No he pocketted it up and we saw no more of it  Presid  Do you know of any quarrel he had with Widow Careful  Frisk  Yes a day or two before he went to her shop for some gingerbread but as he already owed her sixpence she would not let him have any till he had paid his debts  Presid  How did he take this disappointment  Frisk  He said he would be revenged on her  Presid  Are you sure he used such words  Frisk  Yes Loiter heard him as well as myself  Loiter  I did Sir  Presid  Do either of you know any more of this affair  Both  No Sir  Presid  You may go  The President now observed that  these witnesses had done a great deal in establishing proofs against Riot for it was now pretty certain that no one but himself could have been in possession of the top at the time the crime was committed and also it appeared that he had declared a malicious intention against the woman which it was highly probable he would put in executionAs the court was debating about the next step to be taken they were acquainted that Jack the widow's son was waiting at the school door for admission and a person being sent out for him Riot was found threatening the boy and bidding him go home about his business The boy was however conveyed safely into the room when he thus addressed himself to the President  Jack  Sir an please your worship as I was looking about this morning for sticks in the hedge over against our house I found this buckle So I thought to myself sure this must belong  to the rascal that broke our windows So I have brought it to see if any body in the school would own it  Presid  On which side of the hedge did you find it  Jack  On the other side from our house in the close  Presid  Let us see it Gentlemen this is so smart a buckle that I am sure I remember it at once and so I dare say you all do  All  It is Riot's  Presid  Has any body observed Riot's shoes today  One Boy  Yes he has got them tied with strings  Presid  Very well Gentlemen we have nothing more to do than to draw up an account of all the evidence we have heard and lay it before his lordship Jack you may go home  Jack  Pray Sir let somebody go with me for I am afraid of Riot who has just been threatening me at the door  Presid  Master Bold will please to go along with the boy  The minutes of the court were then drawn up and the President took them to the Judge's chamber After the Judge had perused them he ordered an indictment to be drawn up against Peter Riot  "for that he meanly clandestinely and with malice aforethought had broken three panes in the window of Widow Careful with a certain instrument called a top whereby he had committed an atrocious injury on an innocent person and had brought a disgrace upon the society to which he belonged"  At the same time he sent an officer to inform Master Riot that his trial would come on the next morning  Riot who was with some of his gay companions affected to treat the matter with great indifference and even to make a jest of it However in the morning he thought it best to endeavour to make it up and accordingly when  the court was assembled he sent one of his friends with a shilling saying that he would not trouble them with any further enquiries but would pay the sum that had been issued out of the public stock On the receipt of this message the Judge rose with much severity in his countenance and observing that by such a contemptuous behaviour towards the court the criminal had greatly added to his offence he ordered two officers with their staves immediately to go and bring in Riot and to use force if he should resist them The culprit thinking it best to submit was presently led in between the two officers when being placed at the bar the Judge thus addressed him  "I am sorry Sir that any member of this society can be so little sensible of the nature of a crime and so little acquainted with the principles of a court of justice as you have shewn yourself to be by the proposal you took the improper liberty of sending to us If you meant  it as a confession of your guilt you certainly ought to have waited to receive from us the penalty we thought proper to inflict and not to have imagined that an offer of the mere payment of damages would satisfy the claims of justice against you If you had only broken the window by accident and on your own accord offered restitution nothing less than the full damages could have been accepted But you now stand charged with having done this mischief meanly secretly and maliciously and thereby have added a great deal of criminal intention to the act Can you then think that a court like this designed to watch over the morals as well as protect the properties of our community can so slightly pass over such aggravated offences You can claim no merit from confessing the crime now that you know so much evidence will appear against you And if you choose still to plead not guilty you  are at liberty to do it and we will proceed immediately to the trial without taking any advantage of the confession implied by your offer of payment"  Riot stood silent for some time and then begged to be allowed to consult with his friends what was best for him to do This was agreed to and he was permitted to retire though under guard of an officer After a short absence he returned with more humility in his looks and said that he pleaded guilty and threw himself on the mercy of the court The Judge then made a speech of some length for the purpose of convincing the prisoner as well as the bystanders of the enormity of the crime He then pronounced the following sentence  "You Peter Riot are hereby sentenced to pay the sum of half a crown to the public treasury as a satisfaction for the mischief you have done and your attempt to conceal it You are  to repair to the house of Widow Careful accompanied by such witnesses as we shall appoint and there having first paid her the sum you owe her you shall ask her pardon for the insult you offered her You shall likewise tomorrow after school stand up in your place and before all the scholars ask pardon for the disgrace you have been the means of bringing upon the society and in particular you shall apologize to Master Luckless for the disagreeable circumstance you were the means of bringing him into Till all this is complied with you shall not presume to come into the play ground or join in any of the diversions of the school and all persons are hereby admonished not to keep you company till this is done"  Riot was then dismissed to his room and in the afternoon he was taken to the widow's who was pleased to receive his submission graciously and at the same time to apologize for her own improper  treatment of Master Luckless to whom she sent a present of a nice ball by way of amends  Thus ended this important business  THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS  TutorGeorgeHarry  G  WHAT a delightful smell  H  Charming It is sweeter than Mr Essence's shop  T  Do you know whence it comes  G  Oit is from the beanfield on the other side of the hedge I suppose  T  It is This is the month in which beans are in blossom Seethe stalks are full of their black and white flowers  H  I see peas in blossom too on the other side of the field  G  You told us some time ago of grass and corn flowers but they make a poor figure compared to these  T  They do The glory of a cornfield is when it is ripe but peas and beans look very shabbily at that time But suppose we take a closer view of these blossoms Go you George and bring me a bean plant and you Harry a pea  They go and bring them  T  Now let us sit down and compare them Do you think these flowers much alike  H  O novery little  G  Yesa good deal  T  A little and a good deal How can that be Come let us see In the first place they do not much resemble each other in size or colour  G  Nobut I think they do in shape  T  True They are both irregular flowers and have the same distribution of parts They are of the kind called  papilionaceous  from  papilio  the Latin word for a butterfly which insect they are thought to resemble  G  The pea does a little but not much  T  Some do much more than these Wellyou see first a broad leaf standing upright but somewhat bent back this is named the  standard  On each side are two narrower called the  wings  The under side of the flower is formed of a hollow part resembling a boat this is called the  keel  G  It is very like a boat indeed  T  In some kinds however it is divided in the middle and so is like a boat split in two All these parts have claws which unite to form a tube set in a  calyx  or flower cup This tube you observe is longer in the bean than in the pea and the proportions of the other parts are somewhat different but the parts themselves are found in both  H  So they are I think them alike now  T  That is the consequence of examining closely Now let us strip off  all the leaves of this bean flower but the keel What do you think this boat contains  G  It must be those little things that you told us are in all flowers  H  The chives and pistil  T  Right I will draw down the keel gently and you shall see them  H  How curious  T  Here are a number of chives joining in their bodies so as to make a round tube or cylinder through which comes out a crooked thread which is the pistil I will now with a pin slit this cylinder What do you see within it  G  Somewhat like a little pod  T  Trueand to show you that it  is  a pod I will open it and you shall see the seeds within it  H  What tiny things Is this then what makes the beanpod afterwards  T  It is When the blossom drops this seedvessel grows bigger and bigger  and at length hardens as the seeds grow ripe becomes black and shriveled and would burst and shed the seeds if they were not gathered  G  I have seen several burst pods of our sweetpeas under the wall with nothing left in them  T  And it is common for the field peas and beans to lose a great part of the seeds while they are getting in  H  At the bottom of this peastalk there are some pods set already  T  Open one You see that the pod is composed of two shells and that all the seeds are fastened to one side of the pod but alternately to each shell  G  Is it the same in beans  T  Yes and in all other pods of the papilionaceous flowers Wellthis is the general structure of a very numerous and useful class of plants called the  leguminous  or  podded  Of these in this country the greater part are herbaceous with some shrubs In the warm climates  there are also tall trees Many of the leguminous plants afford excellent nourishment for man and beast and their pods have the name of  pulse  G  I have read of persons living on pulse but I did not know what it meant before  T  It is frequently mentioned as part of the diet of abstemious persons Of this kind we eat peas beans and kidney or French beans of all which there are a variety of sorts cultivated Other nations eat lentiles and lupins which are of this class with several others  H  I remember our lupins in the garden have flowers of this kind with pods growing in clusters But we only cultivate them for the colour and smell  T  But other nations eat them Then all the kinds of clover or trefoil which are so useful in feeding cattle belong to this tribe as do likewise  vetches sainfoin and lucerne which are used for the same purpose These principally compose what are usually though improperly called in agriculture  artificial grasses  G  Clover flowers are as sweet as beans but do they bear pods  T  Yes very short ones with one or two seeds in each But there is a kind called nonsuch with a very small yellow flower that has a curious twisted pod like a snailshell Many of the leguminous plants are weak and cannot support themselves hence they are furnished with tendrils by means of which they clasp neighbouring plants and run up them You know the garden peas do so to the sticks which are set in the rows with them Some kinds of vetches run in this manner up the hedges which they decorate with their long bunches of blue or purple flowers Tares which are some of the  slenderest of the family do much mischief among corn by twining round it and choaking it  H  What are they good for then  T  They are weeds or noxious plants with respect to us but doubtless they have their uses in the creation Some of our papilionaceous plants however are able enough to shift for themselves for gorse or furze is of the number  G  What that prickly bush all covered over with yellow flowers that overruns our common  T  Yes Then there is broom a plant as big but without thorns and with larger flowers This is as frequent as furze in some places  H  I know it grows in abundance in the broomfield  T  It does but the naming of fields and places from it is a proof that it is not so common as the other  G  We have some bushes of white broom in the shrubbery and some trees of Spanish broom  T  True You have also a small tree which flowers early and bears a great many pendent bunches of yellow blossoms that look peculiarly beautiful when intermixed with the purple lilacs  H  I know itLaburnum  T  Right That is one of our class of plants too Then there is a large tree with delicate little leaves protected by long thorns and bearing bunches of white papilionaceous flowers  G  I know which you mean but I cannot tell the name  T  It is the Bastard Acacia or Locust tree a native of America Thus you see we have traced this class of plants through all sizes from the trefoil that covers the turf to a large tree I should not however forget two others the Liquorice and the Tamarind The Liquorice with the sweet  root of which you are well acquainted grows in the warmer countries especially Spain but is cultivated in England The Tamarind is a large spreading tree growing in the West Indies and valued for its shade as well as for the cooling acid pulp of its pods which are preserved with sugar and sent over to us  H  I know them very well  T  Welldo you think now you shall both be able to discover a papilionaceous flower when you meet with it again  G  I believe I shall if they are all like these we have been examining  T  They have all the same parts though variously proportioned What are these  G  There is the standard and two wings  H  And the keel  T  Rightthe keel sometimes cleft into two and then it is an irregular fiveleaved  flower The chives are generally ten of which one stands apart from the rest The pistil single and ending in a pod Another circumstance common to most of this tribe is that their leaves are  winged  or  pinnated  that is having leaflets set opposite each other upon a middle rib You see this structure in these bean leaves But in the clovers there are only two opposite leaflets and one terminating whence their name of trefoil or threeleaf What we call a club on cards is properly a clover leaf and the French call it  trefle  which means the same  G  I think this tribe of plants almost as useful as the grasses  T  They perhaps come the next in utility but their seeds such as beans and peas are not quite such good nourishment as corn and bread cannot be made of them  G  But clover is better than grass for cattle  T  It is more fattening and makes cows yield plenty of fine milk Welllet us march  WALKING THE STREETS  A PARABLE  HAVE you ever walked through the crowded streets of a great city  What shoals of people pouring in from opposite quarters like torrents meeting in a narrow valley You would imagine it impossible for them to get through yet all pass on their way without stop or molestation  Were each man to proceed exactly in the line in which the set out he could not move many paces without encountering another full in his track They would strike against each other fall back push forward again block up the way for themselves and those after  them and throw the whole street into confusion  All this is avoided by every man's  yielding a little  Instead of advancing square stiff with arms stuck out every one who knows how to walk the streets glides along his arms close his body oblique and flexible his track gently winding leaving now a few inches on this side now on that so as to pass and be passed without touching in the smallest possible space  He pushes no one into the kennel nor goes into it himself By  mutual accommodation  the path though narrow holds them all  He goes neither much faster nor much slower than those who go in the same direction In the first case he would elbow in the second he would be elbowed  If any accidental stop arises from a carriage crossing a cask rolled a pickpocket  detected or the like he does not increase the bustle by rushing into the midst of it but checks his pace and patiently waits for its removal  Like this is the  march of life  In our progress through the world a thousand things stand continually in our way Some people meet us full in the face with opposite opinions and inclinations Some stand before us in our pursuit of pleasure or interest and others follow close upon our heels Now we ought in the first place to consider that  the road is as free for one as for another  and therefore we have no right to expect that persons should go out of their way to let us pass any more than we out of ours Then if we do not mutually yield and accommodate a little it is clear that we must all stand still or be thrown into a perpetual confusion of squeezing and justling If we are all in a hurry to get on as fast as possible  to some point of pleasure or interest in our view and do not occasionally hold back when the crowd gathers and angry contentions arise we shall only augment the tumult without advancing our own progress On the whole it is our business to move onwards steadily but quietly obstructing others as little as possible yielding a little to this man's prejudices and that man's desires and doing every thing in our power to make the  journey of life  easy to all our fellowtravellers as well as to ourselves  FOURTEENTH EVENING  ON PRESENCE OF MIND  MRS F one day having occasion to be blooded sent for the surgeon As soon as he entered the room her young daughter Eliza started up and was hastily going away when her mother called her back  Mrs F  Eliza do not go I want you to stay by me  Eliz  Dear mamma I can never bear to see you blooded  Mrs F  Why not what harm will it do you  E  O dear I cannot look at blood Besides I cannot bear to see you hurt mamma  Mrs F  O if I can bear to feel it surely you may to see it But comeyou  must  stay and we will talk about it afterwards  Eliza then pale and trembling stood by her mother and saw the whole operation She could not help however turning her head away when the incision was made and the first flow of blood made her start and shudder When all was over and the surgeon gone Mrs F began  Well Eliza what do you think of this mighty matter now Would it not have been very foolish to have run away from it  E  O mamma how frightened I was when he took out his lancet Did it not hurt you a great deal  Mrs F  No very little And if it had it was to do me good you know  E  But why should I stay to see it I could do you no good  Mrs F  Perhaps not but it will do you good to be accustomed to such sights  E  Why mamma  Mrs F  Because instances are every day happening in which it is our duty to assist fellowcreatures in circumstances of pain and distress and if we were to indulge a reluctance to come near them on those occasions we should never acquire either the knowledge or the presence of mind necessary for the purpose  E  But if I had been told how to help people in such cases could not I do it without being used to see them  Mrs F  No We have all naturally a horror at every thing which is the cause of pain and danger to ourselves or others and nothing but habit can give most of us the presence of mind necessary to enable us in such occurrences to employ our knowledge to the best advantage  E  What is  presence of mind  mamma  Mrs F  It is that steady possession of ourselves in cases of alarm that prevents us from being flurried and frightened You have heard the expression of  having all our wits about us  That is the effect of presence of mind and a most inestimable quality it is for without it we are full as likely to run into danger as to avoid it Do you not remember hearing of your cousin Mary's cap taking fire in the candle  E  O yesvery well  Mrs F  Wellthe maid as soon as she saw it set up a great scream and ran out of the room and Mary might have been burnt to death for any assistance she could give her  E  How foolish that was  Mrs F  Yesthe girl had not the least presence of mind and the consequence was depriving her of all recollection and making her entirely useless But as soon as your aunt came  up she took the right method for preventing the mischief The cap was too much on fire to be pulled off so she whipped a quilt from the bed and flung it round Mary's head and thus stifled the flame  E  Mary was a good deal scorched though  Mrs F  Yesbut it was very well that it was no worse If the maid however had acted with any sense at first no harm at all would have been done except burning the cap I remember a much more fatal example of the want of presence of mind The mistress of a family was awakened by flames bursting through the wainscot into her chamber She flew to the staircase and in her confusion instead of going up stairs to call her children who slept together in the nursery overhead and who might all have escaped by the top of the house she ran down and with much danger made way  through the fire into the street When she had got thither the thought of her poor children rushed into her mind but it was too late The stairs had caught fire so that nobody could get near them and they were burned in their beds  E  What a sad thing  Mrs F  Sad indeed Now I will tell you of a different conduct A lady was awakened by the crackling of fire and saw it shining under her chamber floor Her husband would immediately have opened the door but she prevented him since the smoke and flame would then have burst in upon them The children with a maid slept in a room opening out of theirs She went and awakened them and tying together the sheets and blankets she sent down the maid from the window first and then let down the children one by one to her Last of all she descended herself  A few minutes after the floor fell in and all the house was in flames  E  What a happy escape  Mrs F  Yesand with what cool recollection of mind it was managed For mothers to love their children and be willing to run any hazards for them is common but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent exertions in the time of danger I knew a lady who had a fine little boy sitting in her lap He put a whole plum into his mouth which slipped into his throat and choaked him The poor fellow turned black and struggled violently and the mother was so frightened that instead of putting her finger into his throat and pulling out the plum which might easily have been done she laid him on the floor and ran to call for assistance But the maids who came up were as much flurried as she and the child died before any thing effectual was done to relieve him  E  How unhappy she must have been about it  Mrs F  Yes It threw her into an illness which had like to have cost her her life  Another lady seeing her little boy climb up a high ladder set up a violent scream that frightened the child so that he fell down and was much hurt whereas if she had possessed command enough over herself to speak to him gently he might have got down safely  E  Dear mamma what is that running down your armO it is blood  Mrs F  Yesmy arm bleeds again I have stirred it too soon  E  Dear what shall I do  Mrs F  Don't frighten yourself I shall stop the blood by pressing on the orifice with my finger In the mean time do you ring the bell    Eliza  ringsa servant comes  Mrs F  Betty my arm bleeds Can you tie it up again  Betty  I believe I can Madam  She takes off the bandage and puts on another  E  I hope it is stopt now  Mrs F  It is Betty has done it very well You see she went about it with composure This accident puts me in mind of another story which is very well worth hearing A man once reaping in the field cut his arm dreadfully with his sickle and divided an artery  E  What is that mamma  Mrs F  It is one of the canals or pipes through which the blood from the heart runs like water in a pipe brought from a reservoir When one of these is cut it bleeds very violently and the only way to stop it is to make a pressure between the wounded place and the heart in order to intercept the course of the blood towards it Well  this poor man bled profusely and the people about him both men and women were so stupified with fright that some ran one way some another and some stood stock still In short he would soon have bled to death had not a brisk stouthearted wench who came up slipt off her garter and bound it tight above the wound by which means the bleeding was stopt till proper help could be procured  E  What a clever wench But how did she know what to do  Mrs F  She had perhaps heard it as you have done now and so probably had some of the others but they had not presence of mind enough to put it in practice It is a much greater trial of courage however when the danger presses upon ourselves as well as others Suppose a furious bull was to come upon you in the midst of a field You could not possibly escape him by running and attempting it  would destroy your only chance of safety  E  What would that be  Mrs F  I have a story for that too The mother of that Mr Day who wrote  Sandford and Merton  was distinguished as he also was for courage and presence of mind When a young woman she was one day walking in the fields with a companion when they perceived a bull coming to them roaring and tossing about his horns in the most tremendous manner  E  O how I should have screamed  Mrs F  I dare say you would and so did her companion But she bid her walk away behind her as gently as she could whilst she herself stopt short and faced the bull eyeing him with a determined countenance The bull when he had come near stopt also pawing the ground and roaring Few animals will attack a man who steadily waits for them In a while she drew  back some steps still facing the bull The bull followed She stopt and then he stopt In this manner she made good her retreat to the stile over which her companion had before got She then turned and sprung over it and got clear out of danger  E  That was bravely done indeed But I think very few women could have done as much  Mrs F  Such a degree of cool resolution to be sure is not common But I have read of a lady in the EastIndies who showed at least as much She was sitting out of doors with a party of pleasure when they were aware of a huge tyger that had crept through a hedge near them and was just ready to make his fatal spring They were struck with the utmost consternation but she with an umbrella in her hand turned to the tyger and suddenly spread it full in his face This unusual assault so terrified the beast that taking a prodigious  leap he sprung over the fence and plunged out of sight into the neighbouring thicket  E  Wellthat was the boldest thing I ever heard of But is it possible mamma to make oneself courageous  Mrs F  Courage my dear is of two kinds one the gift of nature the other of reason and habit Men have naturally more courage than women that is they are less affected by danger it makes a less impression upon them and does not flutter their spirits so much This is owing to the difference of their bodily constitution and from the same cause some men and some women are more courageous than others But the other kind of courage may in some measure be acquired by every one Reason teaches us to face smaller dangers in order to avoid greater and even to undergo the greatest when our duty requires it  Habit makes us less affected by particular dangers which have often come in our way A sailor does not feel the danger of a storm so much as a landman but if he was mounted upon a spirited horse in a foxchace he would probably be the most timorous man in company The courage of women is chiefly tried in domestic dangers They are attendants on the sick and dying and they must qualify themselves to go through many scenes of terror in these situations which would alarm the stoutesthearted man who was not accustomed to them  E  I have heard that women generally bear pain and illness better than men  Mrs F  They do so because they are more used to them both in themselves and others  E  I think I should not be afraid again to see any body blooded  Mrs F  I hope not It was for that purpose I made you stand by me And I would have you always force yourself to look on and give assistance in cases of this kind however painful it may at first be to you that you may as soon as possible gain that presence of mind which arises from habit  E  But would that make me like to be blooded myself  Mrs F  Not to  like  it but to lose all foolish fears about it and submit calmly to it when good for you But I hope you have sense enough to do that already  PHAETON JUNIOR  OR THE GIG DEMOLISHED  YE heroes of the upper form  Who long for whip and reins  Come listen to a dismal tale  Set forth in dismal strains  Young  Jehu  was a lad of fame  As all the school could tell  At cricket taw and prisonbars  He bore away the bell  Now welcome Whitsuntide was come  And boys with merry hearts  Were gone to visit dear mamma  And eat her pies and tarts  As soon as Jehu saw his sire  A boon a boon he cried  O if I am your darling boy  Let me not be denied  My darling boy indeed thou art  The father wise replied  So name the boon I promise thee  It shall not be denied  Then give me Sir your longlash'd whip  And give your gig and pair  To drive alone to yonder town  And flourish through the fair  The father shook his head My son  You know not what you ask  To drive a gig in crowded streets  Is no such easy task  The horses full of rest and corn  Scarce I myself can guide  And much I fear if you attempt  Some mischief will betide  Then think dear boy of something else  That's better worth your wishing  A bow and quiver bats and balls  A rod and lines for fishing  But nothing could young Jehu please  Except a touch at driving  'Twas all in vain his father found  To spend his breath in striving  At least attend rash boy he cried  And follow good advice  Or in a ditch both gig and you  Will tumble in a trice  Spare spare the whip hold hard the reins  The steeds go fast enough  Keep in the middle beaten track  Nor cross the ruts so rough  And when within the town you come  Be sure with special care  Drive clear of signposts booths and stalls  And monsters of the fair  The youth scarce heard his father out  But roar'd Bring out the whisky  With joy he view'd the rolling wheels  And prancing ponies frisky  He seiz'd the reins and up he sprung  And wav'd the whistling lash  Take care take care his father cried  But off he went slapdash  Who's this light spark the horses thought  We'll try your strength young master  So o'er the rugged turnpike road  Still faster ran and faster  Young Jehu tott'ring in his seat  Now wished to pull them in  But pulling from so young a hand  They valued not a pin  A drove of grunting pigs before  Fill'd up the narrow way  Dash thro' the midst the horses drove  And made a rueful day  For some were trampled under foot  Some crush'd beneath the wheel  Lord how the drivers curs'd and swore  And how the pigs did squeal  A farmer's wife on old blind Ball  Went slowly on the road  With butter eggs and cheese and cream  In two large panniers stow'd  Ere Ball could stride the rut amain  The gig came thund'ring on  Crash went the pannier and the dame  And Ball lay overthrown  Now thro' the town the mettled pair  Ran rattling o'er the stones  They drove the crowd from side to side  And shook poor Jehu's bones  When lo directly in their course  A monstrous form appear'd  A shaggy bear that stalk'd and roar'd  On hinder legs uprear'd  Sideways they started at the sight  And whisk'd the gig halfround  Then cross the crowded marketplace  They flew with furious bound  First o'er a heap of crock'ry ware  The rapid car they whirl'd  And jugs and mugs and pots and pans  In fragments wide were hurl'd  A booth stood near with tempting cakes  And groc'ry richly fraught  All Birmingham on t'other side  The dazzled optics caught  With active spring the nimble steeds  Rush'd thro' the pass between  And scarcely touch'd the car behind  Got thro' not quite so clean  For while one wheel one stall engag'd  Its fellow took the other  Dire was the clash down fell the booths  And made a dreadful pother  Nuts oranges and gingerbread  And figs here rolled around  And scissars knives and thimbles there  Bestrew'd the glitt'ring ground  The fall of boards the shouts and cries  Urg'd on the horses faster  And as they flew at every step  They caused some new disaster  Here lay o'erturn'd in woful plight  A pedlar and his pack  There in a showman's broken box  All London went to wrack  But now the fates decreed to stop  The ruin of the day  And make the gig and driver too  A heavy reck'ning pay  A ditch there lay both broad and deep  Where streams as black as Styx  From every quarter of the town  Their muddy currents mix  Down to its brink in heedless haste  The frantic horses flew  And in the midst with sudden jerk  Their burthen overthrew  The prostrate gig with desperate force  They soon pull'd out again  And at their heels in ruin dire  Drag'd lumb'ring o'er the plain  Here lay a wheel the axle there  The body there remain'd  Till sever'd limb from limb the car  Nor name nor shape retain'd  But Jehu must not be forgot  Left floundering in the flood  With cloaths all drench'd and mouth and eyes  Beplaster'd o'er with mud  In piteous case he waded thro'  And gain'd the slipp'ry side  Where grinning crowds were gather'd round  To mock his fallen pride  They led him to a neighb'ring pump  To clear his dismal face  Whence cold and heartless home he slunk  Involv'd in sore disgrace  And many a bill for damage done  His father had to pay  Take warning youthful drivers all  From Jehu's first essay  WHY AN APPLE FALLS  PAPA said Lucy I have been reading today that Sir Isaac Newton was led to make some of his great discoveries by seeing an apple fall from a tree What was there extraordinary in that  P  There was nothing extraordinary but it happened to catch his attention and set him a thinking  L  And what did he think about  P  He thought by what means the apple was brought to the ground  L  Why I could have told him thatbecause the stalk gave way and there was nothing to support it  P  And what then  L  Why thenit must fall you know  P  But why must it fallthat is the point  L  Because it could not help it  P  But why could it not help it  L  I don't knowthat is an odd question Because there was nothing to keep it up  P  Suppose there was notdoes it follow that it must come to the ground  L  Yes surely  P  Is an apple animate or inanimate  L  Inanimate to be sure  P  And can inanimate things move of themselves  L  NoI think notbut the apple falls because it is forced to fall  P  Right Some force out of itself acts upon it otherwise it would remain for ever where it was notwithstanding it were loosened from the tree  L  Would it  P  Undoubtedlyfor there are only two ways in which it could be moved by its own power of motion or the power of somewhat else moving it Now the first you acknowledge it has not the cause of its motion must therefore be the second And what that is was the subject of the philosopher's enquiry  L  But every thing falls to the ground as well as an apple when there is nothing to keep it up  P  Truethere must therefore be an universal cause of this tendency to fall  L  And what is it  P  Why if things out of the earth cannot move themselves to it there can be no other cause of their coming together than that the earth pulls them  L  But the earth is no more animate than they are so how can it pull  P  Well objected This will bring us to the point Sir Isaac Newton after deep meditation discovered that there was a law in nature called  attraction  by virtue of which every particle of matter that is every thing of which the world is composed draws towards it every other particle of matter with a force proportioned to its size and distance Lay two marbles on the table They have a tendency to come together and if there were nothing else in the world they would come together but they are also attracted by the table by the ground and by every  thing besides in the room and these different attractions pull against each other Now the globe of the earth is a prodigious mass of matter to which nothing near it can bear any comparison It draws therefore with mighty force every thing within its reach which is the cause of their falling and this is called the  gravitation  of bodies or what gives them  weight  When I lift up any thing I act contrary to this force for which reason it seems  heavy  to me and the heavier the more matter it contains since that increases the attraction of the earth for it Do you understand this  L  I think I do It is like a loadstone drawing a needle  P  Yesthat is an attraction but of a particular kind only taking place between the magnet and iron But gravitation or the attraction of the earth acts upon every thing alike  L  Then it is pulling you and me at this moment  P  It is  L  But why do not we stick to the ground then  P  Because as weare a live we have a power of selfmotion which can to a certain degree overcome the attraction of the earth But the reason you cannot jump a mile high as well as a foot is this attraction which brings you down again after the force of your jump is spent  L  I think then I begin to understand what I have heard of people living on the other side of the world I believe they are called  Antipodes  who have their feet turned towards ours and their heads in the air I used to wonder how it could be that they did not fall off but I suppose the earth pulls them to it  P  Very true And whither should they fall What have they over their heads  L  I don't knowsky I suppose  P  They have This earth is a vast ball hung in the air and continually spinning round and that is the cause why the sun and stars seem to rise and set At noon we have the sun over our heads when the Antipodes have the stars over theirs and at midnight the stars are over our heads and the sun over theirs So whither should they fall to more than weto the stars or the sun  L  But we are up and they are down  P  What is up but  from  the earth and  towards  the sky Their feet touch the earth and their heads point to the sky as well as ours and we are under their feet as much as they are under ours If a hole were dug quite through the earth what would you see through it  L  Sky with the sun or the stars and now I see the whole matter plainly But pray what supports the earth in the air  P  Why where should it go to  L  I don't knowI suppose where there was most to draw it I have heard that the sun is a great many times bigger than the earth Would it not go to that  P  You have thought very justly on the matter I perceive But I shall take another opportunity of shewing you how this is and why the earth does not fall into the sun of which I confess there seems to be some danger Meanwhile think how far the falling of an apple has carried us  L  To the Antipodes and I know not where  P  You may see from thence what use may be made of the commonest fact by a thinking mind  NATURE AND EDUCATION  A FABLE  Nature  and  Education  were one day walking together through a nursery of trees See says  Nature  how straight and fine those firs growthat is my doing But as to those oaks they are all crooked and stunted that my good sister is your fault You have planted them too close and not pruned them properly Nay sister said  Education  I am sure I have taken all possible pains about them but you gave me bad acorns so how should they ever make fine trees  The dispute grew warm and at length instead of blaming one another for negligence they began to boast of their own powers and to challenge each other to a contest for the superiority It was agreed that each should adopt a favourite and rear it up in spite of all  the ill offices of her opponent  Nature  fixed upon a vigorous young Weymouth Pine the parent of which had grown to be the mainmast of a man of war Do what you will to this plant said she to her sister I am resolved to push it up as straight as an arrow  Education  took under her care a crabtree This said she I will rear to be at least as valuable as your pine  Both went to work While  Nature  was feeding her pine with plenty of wholesome juices  Education  passed a strong rope round its top and pulling it downwards with all her force fastened it to the trunk of a neighbouring oak The pine laboured to ascend but not being able to surmount the obstacle it pushed out to one side and presently became bent like a bow Still such was its vigour that its top after descending as low as its branches made a new shoot upwards but its beauty and usefulness were quite destroyed  The crabtree cost  Education  a world of pains She pruned and pruned and endeavoured to bring it into shape but in vain  Nature  thrust out a bough this way and a knot that way and would not push a single leading shoot upwards The trunk was indeed kept tolerably straight by constant efforts but the head grew awry and illfashioned and made a scrubby figure At length  Education  despairing of making a sightly plant of it ingrafted the stock with an apple and brought it to bear tolerable fruit  At the end of the experiment the sisters met to compare their respective success Ah sister said  Nature  I see it is in your power to spoil the best of my works Ah sister said  Education  it is a hard matter to contend against youhowever something may be done by taking pains enough  FIFTEENTH EVENING  AVERSION SUBDUED  A DRAMA  SCENEA Road in the Country  ArburyBelford  walking  Belford  PRAY who is the present possessor of the Brookby estate  Arbury  A man of the name of Goodwin  B  Is he a good neighbour to you  A  Far from it and I wish he had settled a hundred miles off rather than come here to spoil our neighbourhood  B  I am sorry to hear that but what is your objection to him  A  O there is nothing in which we agree In the first place he is quite of  the other side in politics and that you know is enough to prevent all intimacy  B  I am not entirely of that opinion but what else  A  He is no sportsman and refuses to join in our association for protecting the game Neither does he choose to be a member of any of our clubs  B  Has he been asked  A  I don't know that he has directly but he might easily propose himself if he liked it But he is of a close unsociable temper and I believe very niggardly  B  How has he shewn it  A  His style of living is not equal to his fortune and I have heard of several instances of his attention to petty economy  B  Perhaps he spends his money in charity  A  Not he I dare say It was but last week that a poor fellow who had  lost his all by a fire went to him with a subscriptionpaper in which were the names of all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood and all the answer he got was that he would consider of it  B  And did he consider  A  I don't know but I suppose it was only an excuse Then his predecessor had a park well stocked with deer and used to make liberal presents of venison to all his neighbours But this frugal gentleman has sold them all off and got a flock of sheep instead  B  I don't see much harm in that now mutton is so dear  A  To be sure he has a right to do as he pleases with his park but that is not the way to be beloved you know As to myself I have reason to think he bears me particular illwill  B  Then he is much in the wrong for I believe you are as free from illwill to others as any man living But how has he shewn it pray  A  In twenty instances He had a horse upon sale the other day to which I took a liking and bid money for it As soon as he found I was about it he sent it off to a fair on the other side of the county My wife you know is passionately fond of cultivating flowers Riding lately by his grounds she observed something new and took a great longing for a root or cutting of it My gardener mentioned her wish to his contrary I own to my inclination and he told his master but instead of obliging her he charged the gardener on no account to touch the plant A little while ago I turned off a man for saucy behaviour but as he had lived many years with me and was a very useful servant I meant to take him again upon his submission which I did not doubt would soon happen Instead of that he goes and offers himself to my civil neighbour who without deigning to apply to me even for  a character entertains him immediately In short he has not the least of a gentleman about him and I would give any thing to be well rid of him  B  Nothing to be sure can be more unpleasant in the country than a bad neighbour and I am concerned it is your lot to have one But there is a man who seems as if he wanted to speak with you  A countryman approaches  A  Ah it is the poor fellow that was burnt out Well Richard how go you onwhat has the subscription produced you  Richard  Thank your honour my losses are nearly all made up  A  I am very glad of that but when I saw the paper last it did not reach half way  R  It did not Sir but you may remember asking me what Mr Goodwin had done for me and I told you  he took time to consider of it Well SirI found that the very next day he had been at our town and had made very particular enquiry about me and my losses among my neighbours When I called upon him a few days after he told me he was very glad to find that I bore such a good character and that the gentlemen round had so kindly taken up my case and he would prevent the necessity of my going any further for relief Upon which he gave me God bless him a draught upon his banker for fifty pounds  A  Fifty pounds  R  Yes SirIt has made me quite my own man again and I am now going to purchase a new cart and team of horses  A  A noble gift indeed I could never have thought it Well Richard I rejoice at your good fortune I am  sure you are much obliged to Mr Goodwin  R  Indeed I am Sir and to all my good friends God bless you Sir  Goes on  B  Niggardliness at least is not this man's foible  A  NoI was mistaken in that point I wronged him and I am sorry for it But what a pity it is that men of real generosity should not be amiable in their manners and as ready to oblige in trifles as in matters of consequence  B  True'tis a pity when that is really the case  A  How much less an exertion it would have been to have shewn some civility about a horse or a flowerroot  B  A propos of flowers there's your gardener carrying a large one in a pot  Enter Gardener  A  Now James what have you got there  Gard  A flower Sir for Madam from Mr Goodwin's  A  How did you come by it  G  His gardener Sir sent me word to come for it We should have had it before but Mr Goodwin thought it would not move safely  A  I hope he has got more of them  G  He has only a seedling plant or two Sir but hearing that Madam took a liking to it he was resolved to send it her and a choice thing it is I have a note for Madam in my pocket  A  Well go on  Exit Gardener  B  Methinks this does not look like deficiency in civility  A  Noit is a very polite actionI can't deny it and I am obliged to him for it Perhaps indeed he may feel he owes me a little amends  B  PossiblyIt shows he  can  feel however  A  It does Ha there's Yorkshire Tom coming with a string of horses from the fair I'll step up and speak to him Now Tom how have horses gone at Markethill  Tom  Dear enough your honour  A  How much more did you get for Mr Goodwin's mare than I offered him  T  Ah Sir that was not a thing for your riding and that Mr Goodwin well knew You never saw such a vicious toad She had like to have killed the groom two or three times So I was ordered to offer her to the mailcoach people and get what I could from them I might have sold her better if Mr Goodwin would have let me for she was a fine creature to look at as need be and quite sound  A  And was that the true reason Tom why the mare was not sold to me  T  It was indeed Sir  A  Then I am highly obliged to Mr Goodwin  Tom rides on  This was handsome behaviour indeed  B  Yes I think it was somewhat more than politenessit was real goodness of heart  A  It was I find I must alter my opinion of him and I do it with pleasure But after all his conduct with respect to my servant is somewhat unaccountable  B  I see reason to think so well of him in the main that I am inclined to hope he will be acquitted in this matter too  A  There the fellow is I wonder he has my old livery on yet  Ned approaches pulling off his hat  N  Sir I was coming to your honour  A  What can you have to say to me now Ned  N  To ask pardon Sir for my misbehaviour and beg you to take me again  A  Whathave you so soon parted with your new master  N  Mr Goodwin never was my master Sir He only kept me in his house till I could make it up with you again for he said he was sure you were too honourable a gentleman to turn off an old servant without good reason and he hoped you would admit my excuses after your anger was over  A  Did he say all that  N  Yes Sir and he advised me not to delay any longer to ask your pardon  A  Wellgo to my house and I will talk with you on my return  B  Now my friend what think you of this  A  I think more than I can well express It will be a lesson to me never to make hasty judgments again  B  Why indeed to have concluded that such a man had nothing of the  gentleman about him must have been rather hasty  A  I acknowledge it But it is the misfortune of these reserved characters that they are so long in making themselves known though when they are known they often prove the most truly estimable I am afraid even now that I must be content with esteeming him at a distance  B  Why so  A  You know I am of an open sociable disposition  B  Perhaps he is so too  A  If he was surely we should have been better acquainted before this time  B  It may have been prejudice rather than temper that has kept you asunder  A  Possibly so That vile spirit of party has such a sway in the country that men of the most liberal dispositions can hardly free themselves from its influence  It poisons all the kindness of society and yonder comes an instance of its pernicious effects  B  Who is he  A  A poor schoolmaster with a large family in the next markettown who has lost all his scholars by his activity on our side in the last election I heartily wish it was in my power to do something for him for he is a very honest man though perhaps rather too warm  The schoolmaster comes up  Now Mr Penman how go things with you  P  I thank you Sir they have gone poorly enough but I hope they are in the way to mend  A  I am glad to hear itbut how  P  Why Sir the freeschool of Stoke is vacant and I believe I am likely to get it  A  AyI wonder at that I thought it was in the hands of the other party  P  It is Sir but Mr Goodwin has been so kind as to give me a recommendation and his interest is sufficient to carry it  A  Mr Goodwin you surprise me  P  I was much surprised too Sir He sent for me of his own accord for I should never have thought of asking  him  a favour and told me he was sorry a man should be injured in his profession on account of party and as I could not live comfortably where I was he would try to settle me in a better place So he mentioned the vacancy of Stoke and offered me letters to the trustees I was never so affected in my life SirI could hardly speak to return him thanks He kept me to dinner and treated me with the greatest respect Indeed I believe there is not a kinder man breathing than Mr Goodwin  A  You have the best reason in the world to say so Mr Penman Whatdid he converse familiarly with you  P  Quite so Sir We talked a great deal about partyaffairs in this neighbourhood and he lamented much that differences of this kind should keep worthy men at a distance from each other I took the liberty Sir of mentioning your name He said he had not the honour of being acquainted with you but he had a sincere esteem for your character and should be glad of any occasion to cultivate a friendship with you For my part I confess to my shame I did not think there could have been such a man on that side  A  Wellgood morning  P  Your most obedient Sir  He goes  A After some silence  Come my friend let us go  B  Whither  A  Can you doubt itto Mr Goodwin's to be sure After all I have heard can I exist a moment without  acknowledging the injustice I have done him and begging his friendship  B  I shall be happy I am sure to accompany you on that errand But who is to introduce us  A  O what is form and ceremony in a case like this Comecome  B  Most willingly  Exeunt  THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER  MR L was one morning riding by himself when dismounting to gather a plant in the hedge his horse got loose and galloped away before him He followed calling the horse by his name which stopt but on his approach set off again At length a little boy in a neighbouring field seeing the affair ran across where the road made a turn and getting before the horse took him by  the bridle and held him till his owner came up Mr L looked at the boy and admired his ruddy cheerful countenance Thank you my good lad said he you have caught my horse very cleverly What shall I give you for your trouble putting his hand into his pocket  I want nothing Sir said the boy  Mr L  Don't you so much the better for you Few men can say as much But pray what were you doing in the field  B  I was rooting up weeds and tenting the sheep that are feeding on the turneps  Mr L  And do you like this employment  B  Yes very well this fine weather  Mr L  But had you not rather play  B  This is not hard work it is almost as good as play  Mr L  Who set you to work  B  My daddy Sir  Mr L  Where does he live  B  Just by among the trees there  Mr L  What is his name  B  Thomas Hurdle  Mr L  And what is yours  B  Peter Sir  Mr L  How old are you  B  I shall be eight at Michaelmas  Mr L  How long have you been out in this field  B  Ever since six in the morning  Mr L  And are not you hungry  B  YesI shall go to my dinner soon  Mr L  If you had sixpence now what would you do with it  B  I don't know I never had so much in my life  Mr L  Have you no playthings  B  Playthings what are those  Mr L  Such as balls ninepins marbles tops and wooden horses  B  No Sir but our Tom makes footballs to kick in the cold weather and we set traps for birds and then I have a jumping pole and a pair of stilts to walk through the dirt with and I had a hoop but it is broke  Mr L  And do you want nothing else  B  No I have hardly time for those for I always ride the horses to field and bring up the cows and run to the town of errands and that is as good as play you know  Mr L  Well but you could buy apples or gingerbread at the town I suppose if you had money  B  OI can get apples at home and as for gingerbread I don't mind it much for my mammy gives me a pye now and then and that is as good  Mr F  Would not you like a knife to cut sticks  B  I have onehere it isbrother Tom gave it me  Mr L  Your shoes are full of holesdon't you want a better pair  B  I have a better pair for Sundays  Mr L  But these let in water  B  O I don't care for that  Mr L  Your hat is all torn too  B  I have a better at home but I had as lieve have none at all for it hurts my head  Mr L  What do you do when it rains  B  If it rains very hard I get under the hedge till it is over  Mr L  What do you do when you are hungry before it is time to go home  B  I sometimes eat a raw turnep  Mr L  But if there are none  B  Then I do as well as I can I work on and never think of it  Mr L  Are you not dry sometimes this hot weather  B  Yes but there is water enough  Mr L  Why my little fellow you are quite a philosopher  B  Sir  Mr L  I say you are a philosopher but I am sure you do not know what that means  B  No Sirno harm I hope  Mr L  No no  laughing  Well my boy you seem to want nothing at all so I shall not give you money to make you want any thing But were you ever at school  B  No Sir but daddy says I shall go after harvest  Mr L  You will want books then  B  Yes the boys have all a spellingbook and a testament  Mr L  Well then I will give you themtell your daddy so and that it is because I thought you a very good contented little boy So now go to your sheep again  B  I will Sir Thank you  Mr L  Good bye Peter  B  Good bye Sir  FLYING AND SWIMMING  How I wish I could fly cried Robert as he was gazing after his pigeons that were exercising themselves in a morning's flight How fine it must be to soar to such a height and to dash through the air with so swift a motion  I doubt not said his father that the pigeons have great pleasure in it but we have our pleasures too and it is idle to indulge longings for things quite out of our power  R  But do you think it impossible for men to learn to fly  F  I dofor I see they are not furnished by nature with organs requisite for the purpose  R  Might not artificial wings be contrived such as Daedalus is said to have used  F  Possibly they might but the difficulty would be to put them in motion  R  Why could not a man move them if they were fastened to his shoulders as well as a bird  F  Because he has got arms to move which the bird has not The same organs which in quadrupeds are employed to move the fore legs and in man the arms are spent in birds on the motion of the wings Nay the muscles or bundles of flesh that move the wings are proportionally much larger and stronger than those bestowed upon our arms so that it is impossible formed as we are that we should use wings were they made and fastened on with ever so much art  R  But angels and Cupids and such things are painted with wings and I think they look very natural  F  To you they may appear so but an anatomist sees them at once to be monsters which could not really exist  R  God might have created winged men however if he had pleased  F  No doubt but they could not have had the same shape that men have now They would have been different creatures such as it was not in his plan to make But you that long to flyconsider if you have made use of all the faculties already given you You want to subdue the element of airwhat can you do with that of water Can you swim  R  No not yet  F  Your companion Johnson I think can swim very well  R  Yes  F  Reflect then on the difference betwixt him and you A boat oversets with you both in a deep stream You plump at once to the bottom and infallibly lose your life He rises like a cork darts away with the greatest ease and reaches the side in perfect safety Both of you pursued by a bull come to the side of a river He jumps in and crosses it You are drowned if you attempt  it and tossed by the bull if you do not What an advantage he has over you Yet you are furnished with exactly the same bodily powers that he is How is this  R  Because he has been taught and I have not  F  Truebut it is an easy thing to learn and requires no other instruction than boys can give one another when they bathe together so that I wonder any body should neglect to acquire an art at once agreeable and useful The Romans used to say by way of proverb of a blockhead  "He can neither read nor swim"  You may remember how Caesar was saved at Alexandria by throwing himself into the sea and swimming with one hand while he held up his Commentaries with the other  R  I should like very well to swim and I have often tried but I always pop under water and that daunts me  F  And it is that fear which prevents you from succeeding  R  But is it as natural for man to swim as for other creatures I have heard that the young of all other animals swim the first time they are thrown into the water  F  They dothey are without fear In our climate the water is generally cold and is early made an object of terror But in the hot countries where bathing is one of the greatest of pleasures young children swim so early and well that I should suppose they take to it almost naturally  R  I am resolved to learn and I will ask Johnson to take me with him to the river  F  Do but let him find you a safe place to begin at I don't want you however to proceed so cautiously as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack did  R  How was that  F  He spread himself out on a large table and placing before him a bason of water with a frog in it he struck with his arms and legs as he observed the animal do  R  And did that teach him  F  Yesto swim on dry land but he never ventured himself in the water  R  Shall I get corks or bladders  F  No learn to depend on your own powers It is a good lesson in other things as well as in swimming Learning to swim with corks is like learning to construe Latin with a translation on the other side It saves some pains at first but the business is not done half so effectually  THE FEMALE CHOICE  A TALE  A YOUNG girl having fatigued herself one hot day with running about the garden sat herself down in a pleasant arbour where she presently fell asleep During her slumber two female figures presented themselves before her One was loosely habited in a thin robe of pink with light green trimmings Her sash of silver gauze flowed to the ground Her fair hair fell in ringlets down her neck and her headdress consisted of artificial flowers interwoven with feathers She held in one hand a ballticket and in the other a fancydress all covered with spangles and knots of gay ribbon She advanced smiling to the girl and with a familiar air thus addressed her  My dearest Melissa I am a kind genius who have watched you from your birth and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand till at length they have rendered you a companion worthy of me See what I have brought you This dress and this ticket will give you free access to all the ravishing delights of my palace With me you will pass your days in a perpetual round of evervarying amusements Like the gay butterfly you will have no other business than to flutter from flower to flower and spread your charms before admiring spectators No restraints no toils no dull tasks are to be found within my happy domains All is pleasure life and good humour Come then my dear Let me put you on this dress which will make you quite enchanting and away away with me  Melissa felt a strong inclination to comply with the call of this inviting  nymph but first she thought it would be prudent at least to ask her name  My name said she is DISSIPATION  The other female then advanced She was clothed in a close habit of brown stuff simply relieved with white She wore her smooth hair under a plain cap Her whole person was perfectly neat and clean Her look was serious but satisfied and her air was staid and composed She held in one hand a distaff on the opposite arm hung a workbasket and the girdle round her waste was garnished with scissars knitting needles reels and other implements of female labour A bunch of keys hung at her side She thus accosted the sleeping girl  Melissa I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion of your mother and I now offer my protection to you I have no allurements to tempt you with like those of  my gay rival Instead of spending all your time in amusements if you enter yourself of my train you must rise early and pass the long day in a variety of employments some of them difficult some laborious and all requiring some exertion of body or mind You must dress plainly live mostly at home and aim at being useful rather than shining But in return I will ensure you content even spirits selfapprobation and the esteem of all who thoroughly know you If these offers appear to your young mind less inviting than those of my rival be assured however that they are more real She has promised much more than she can ever make good Perpetual pleasures are no more in the power of Dissipation than of Vice or Folly to bestow Her delights quickly pall and are inevitably succeeded by languor and disgust She appears to you under a diguise and what  Lately published  By Mrs BARBAULD  LESSONS for CHILDREN from two to four years of age four parts price d each  HYMNS in Prose for
