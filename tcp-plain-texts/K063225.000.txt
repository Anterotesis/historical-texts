_NATURAL productions are generally formed by degrees Vegetables grow from a tender shoot and animals from an infant state The latter being destined to act extend their operations as their powers increase they exhibit a progress in what they perform as well as in the faculties  they acquire This progress in the case of man is continued to a greater extent than in that of any other animal Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilization Hence the supposed departure of mankind from the state of their nature hence our conjectures and different opinions of what man must have been in the first age of his being The poet the historian and the moralist frequently allude to this ancient time and under the emblems of gold or of iron represent a condition and a manner of life from which mankind have either degenerated or on which they have greatly improved On either supposition the first state of our nature must have borne no resemblance to what men have exhibited in any subsequent period historical monuments even of the earliest date are to be considered as novelties and the most common establishments of human society are to be classed among the incroachments which fraud oppression or a busy invention have made upon the reign of nature by which the chief of our grievances or blessings were equally withheld  AMONG the writers who have attempted to distinguish in the human character its original qualities and to point out the limits between nature and art some have represented mankind in their first condition as possessed of mere animal sensibility without any exercise of the faculties that render them superior to the brutes without any political union without any means of explaining their sentiments and even without possessing any of the apprehensions and passions which the voice and the gesture are so well fitted to express  Others have made the state of nature to consist in perpetual wars kindled by competition for dominion and interest where every individual had a separate quarrel with his kind and where the presence of a fellowcreature was the signal of battle  THE desire of laying the foundation of a favourite system or a fond expectation perhaps that we may be able to penetrate the secrets of nature to the very source of existence have on this subject led to many fruitless inquiries and given rise to many wild suppositions Among the various qualities which mankind possess we select one or a few particulars on which to establish a theory and in framing our account of what man was in some imaginary state of nature we overlook what he has always appeared within the reach of our own observation and in the records of history  IN every other instance however the natural historian thinks himself obliged to collect facts not to offer conjectures When he treats of any particular species of animals he supposes that their present dispositions and instincts are the same they originally had and that their present manner of life is a continuance of their first destination He admits that his knowledge of the material system of the world consists in a collection of facts or at most in general tenets derived from particular observations and experiments It is only in what relates to himself and in matters the most important and the most easily known that he substitutes hypothesis instead of reality and confounds  the provinces of imagination and reason of poetry and science  BUT without entering any farther on questions either in moral or physical subjects relating to the manner or the origin of our knowledge without any disparagement to that subtilty which would analyze every sentiment and trace every mode of being to its source it may be safely affirmed That the character of man as he now exists that the laws of this animal and intellectual system on which his happiness now depends deserve our principal study and that general principles relating to this or any other subject are useful only so far as they are founded on just observation and lead to the knowledge of important consequences or so far as they enable us to act with success when we would apply either the intellectual or the physical powers of nature to the great purposes of human life  IF both the earliest and the latest accounts collected from every quarter of the earth represent mankind as assembled in troops and companies and the individual always joined by affection to one party while he is possibly opposed to another employed in the exercise of recollection and foresight inclined to communicate his own sentiments and to be made acquainted with those of others these facts must be admitted as the foundation of all our reasoning relative to man His mixed disposition to friendship or enmity his reason his use of language and articulate sounds like the shape and the erect position of his body are to be considered as so many attributes of his  nature they are to be retained in his description as the wing and the paw are in that of the eagle and the lion and as different degrees of fierceness vigilance timidity or speed are made to occupy a place in the natural history of different animals  IF the question be put What the mind of man could perform when left to itself and without the aid of any foreign direction we are to look for our answer in the history of mankind Particular experiments which have been found so useful in establishing the principles of other sciences could probably on this subject teach us nothing important or new we are to take the history of every active being from his conduct in the situation to which he is formed not from his appearance in any forced or uncommon condition a wild man therefore caught in the woods where he had always lived apart from his species is a singular instance not a specimen of any general character As the anatomy of an eye which had never received the impressions of light or that of an ear which had never felt the impulse of sounds would probably exhibit defects in the very structure of the organs themselves arising from their not being applied to their proper functions so any particular case of this sort would only shew in what degree the powers of apprehension and sentiment could exist where they had not been employed and what would be the defects and imbecilities of a heart in which the emotions that pertain to society had never been felt  MANKIND are to be taken in groupes as they have always subsisted The history of the individual is but a detail of the sentiments and thoughts  he has entertained in the view of his species and every experiment relative to this subject should be made with intire societies not with single men We have every reason however to believe that in the case of such an experiment made we shall suppose with a colony of children transplanted from the nursery and left to form a society apart untaught and undisciplined we should only have the same things repeated which in so many different parts of the earth have been transacted already The members of our little society would feed and sleep would herd together and play would have a language of their own would quarrel and divide would be to one another the most important objects of the scene and in the ardour of their friendships and competitions would overlook their personal danger and suspend the care of their selfpreservation Has not the human race been planted like the colony in question Who has directed their course whose instruction have they heard or whose example have they followed  NATURE therefore we shall presume having given to every animal its mode of existence its dispositions and manner of life has dealt equally with those of the human race and the natural historian who would collect the properties of this species may fill up every article now as well as he could have done in any former age Yet one property by which man is distinguished has been sometimes overlooked in the account of his nature or has only served to mislead our attention In other classes of animals the individual advances from infancy to age or maturity and he attains in the compass of a single life to all the perfection  his nature can reach but in the human kind the species has a progress as well as the individual they build in every subsequent age on foundations formerly laid and in a succession of years tend to a perfection in the application of their faculties to which the aid of long experience is required and to which many generations must have combined their endeavours We observe the progress they have made we distinctly enumerate many of its steps we can trace them back to a distant antiquity of which no record remains nor any monument is preserved to inform us what were the openings of this wonderful scene The consequence is that instead of attending to the character of our species where the particulars are vouched by the surest authority we endeavour to trace it through ages and scenes unknown and instead of supposing that the beginning of our story was nearly of a piece with the sequel we think ourselves warranted to reject every circumstance of our present condition and frame as adventitious and foreign to our nature The progress of mankind from a supposed state of animal sensibility to the attainment of reason to the use of language and to the habit of society has been accordingly painted with a force of imagination and its steps have been marked with a boldness of invention that would tempt us to admit among the materials of history the suggestions of fancy and to receive perhaps as the model of our nature in its original state some of the animals whose shape has the greatest resemblance to ours  ROUSSEAU sur l'origine de l'inegalité parmi les hommes    IT would be ridiculous to affirm as a discovery that the species of the horse was probably never the same with that of the lion yet in opposition to what has dropped from the pens of eminent writers we are obliged to observe that men have always appeared among animals a distinct and a superior race that neither the possession of similar organs nor the approximation of shape nor the use of the hand  Traité de l'esprit  nor the continued intercourse with this sovereign artist has enabled any other species to blend their nature or their inventions with his that in his rudest state he is found to be above them and in his greatest degeneracy never descends to their level He is in short a man in every condition and we can learn nothing of his nature from the analogy of other animals If we would know him we must attend to himself to the course of his life and the tenor of his conduct With him the society appears to be as old as the individual and the use of the tongue as universal as that of the hand or the foot If there was a time in which he had his acquaintance with his own species to make and his faculties to acquire it is a time of which we have no record and in relation to which our opinions can serve no purpose and are supported by no evidence  WE are often tempted into those boundless regions of ignorance or conjecture by a fancy which delights in creating rather than in merely retaining the forms which are presented before it we are the dupes of a subtilty which promises to supply  every defect of our knowledge and by filling up a few blanks in the story of nature pretends to conduct our apprehension nearer to the source of existence On the credit of a few observations we are apt to presume that the secret may soon be laid open and that what is termed  wisdom  in nature may be referred to the operation of physical powers We forget that physical powers employed in succession and combined to a salutary purpose constitute those very proofs of design from which we infer the existence of God and that this truth being once admitted we are no longer to search for the source of existence we can only collect the laws which the author of nature has established and in our latest as well as our earliest discoveries only come to perceive a mode of creation or providence before unknown  WE speak of art as distinguished from nature but art itself is natural to man He is in some measure the artificer of his own frame as well as his fortune and is destined from the first age of his being to invent and contrive He applies the same talents to a variety of purposes and acts nearly the same part in very different scenes He would be always improving on his subject and he carries this intention whereever he moves through the streets of the populous city or the wilds of the forest While he appears equally fitted to every condition he is upon this account unable to settle in any At once obstinate and fickle he complains of innovations and is never sated with novelty He is perpetually busied in reformations and is continually wedded to his errors If he dwell in a cave he would improve it into a cottage if he has already built he would still build to a greater extent  But he does not propose to make rapid and hasty transitions his steps are progressive and slow and his force like the power of a spring silently presses on every resistance an effect is sometimes produced before the cause is perceived and with all his talent for projects his work is often accomplished before the plan is devised It appears perhaps equally difficult to retard or to quicken his pace if the projector complain he is tardy the moralist thinks him unstable and whether his motions be rapid or slow the scenes of human affairs perpetually change in his management his emblem is a passing stream not a stagnating pool We may desire to direct his love of improvement to its proper object we may wish for stability of conduct but we mistake human nature if we wish for a termination of labour or a scene of repose  THE occupations of men in every condition bespeak their freedom of choice their various opinions and the multiplicity of wants by which they are urged but they enjoy or endure with a sensibility or a phlegm which are nearly the same in every situation They possess the shores of the Caspian or the Atlantic by a different tenure but with equal ease On the one they are fixed to the soil and seem to be formed for settlement and the accommodation of cities The names they bestow on a nation and on its territory are the same On the other they are mere animals of passage prepared to roam on the face of the earth and with their herds in search of new pasture and favourable seasons to follow the sun in his annual course  MAN finds his lodgement alike in the cave the cottage and the palace and his subsistence equally in the woods in the dairy or the farm He assumes the distinction of titles equipage and dress he devises regular systems of government and a complicated body of laws or naked in the woods has no badge of superiority but the strength of his limbs and the sagacity of his mind no rule of conduct but choice no tie with his fellowcreatures but affection the love of company and the desire of safety Capable of a great variety of arts yet dependent on none in particular for the preservation of his being to whatever length he has carried his artifice there he seems to enjoy the conveniencies that suit his nature and to have found the condition to which he is destined The tree which an American on the banks of the Oroonoko  Lafitau moeurs des sauvages  has chosen to climb for the retreat and the lodgement of his family is to him a convenient dwelling The sopha the vaulted dome and the colonade do not more effectually content their native inhabitant  IF we are asked therefore Where the state of nature is to be found we may answer It is here and it matters not whether we are understood to speak in the island of Great Britain at the Cape of Good Hope or the Straits of Magellan While this active being is in the train of employing his talents and of operating on the subjects around him all situations are equally natural If we are told That vice at least is contrary to nature we  may answer It is worse it is folly and wretchedness But if nature is only opposed to art in what situation of the human race are the footsteps of art unknown In the condition of the savage as well as in that of the citizen are many proofs of human invention and in either is not any permanent station but a mere stage through which this travelling being is destined to pass If the palace be unnatural the cottage is so no less and the highest refinements of political and moral apprehension are not more artificial in their kind than the first operations of sentiment and reason  IF we admit that man is susceptible of improvement and has in himself a principle of progression and a desire of perfection it appears improper to say that he has quitted the state of his nature when he has begun to proceed or that he finds a station for which he was not intended while like other animals he only follows the disposition and employs the powers that nature has given  THE latest efforts of human invention are but a continuation of certain devices which were practised in the earliest ages of the world and in the rudest state of mankind What the savage projects or observes in the forest are the steps which led nations more advanced from the architecture of the cottage to that of the palace and conducted the human mind from the perceptions of sense to the general conclusions of science  ACKNOWLEDGED defects are to man in every condition matter of dislike Ignorance and imbecility are objects of contempt penetration and conduct give eminence and procure esteem Whither  should his feelings and apprehensions on these subjects lead him To a progress no doubt in which the savage as well as the philosopher is engaged in which they have made different advances but in which their ends are the same The admiration Cicero entertained for literature eloquence and civil accomplishments was not more real than that of a Scythian for such a measure of similar endowments as his own apprehension could reach  Were I to boast  says a Tartar prince  Abulgaze Bahadur Chan History of the Tartars    it would be of that wisdom I have received from God For as on the one hand I yield to none in the conduct of war in the disposition of armies whether of horse or of foot and in directing the movements of great or small bodies so on the other I have my talent in writing inferior perhaps only to those who inhabit the great cities of Persia or India Of other nations unknown to me I do not speak  MAN may mistake the objects of his pursuit he may misapply his industry and misplace his improvements If under a sense of such possible errors he would find a standard by which to judge of his own proceedings and arrive at the best state of his nature he cannot find it perhaps in the practice of any individual or of any nation whatever not even in the sense of the majority or the prevailing opinion of his kind He must look for it in the best conceptions of his understanding in the best movements of his heart he must thence discover what is the perfection and the  happiness of which he is capable He will find on the scrutiny that the proper state of his nature taken in this sense is not a condition from which mankind are for ever removed but one to which they may now attain not prior to the exercise of their faculties but procured by their just application  OF all the terms that we employ in treating of human affairs those of  natural  and  unnatural  are the least determinate in their meaning Opposed to affectation frowardness or any other defect of the temper or character the natural is an epithet of praise but employed to specify a conduct which proceeds from the nature of man can serve to distinguish nothing for all the actions of men are equally the result of their nature At most this language can only refer to the general and prevailing sense or practice of mankind and the purpose of every important inquiry on this subject may be served by the use of a language equally familiar and more precise What is just or unjust What is happy or wretched in the manners of men What in their various situations is favourable or adverse to their amiable qualities are questions to which we may expect a satisfactory answer and whatever may have been the original state of our species it is of more importance to know the condition to which we ourselves should aspire than that which our ancestors may be supposed to have left  SECT II  Of the principles of selfpreservation  IF in human nature there are qualities by which it is distinguished from every other part of the animal creation men are themselves in different climates and in different ages greatly diversified So far as we are able to account for this diversity on principles either moral or physical we perform a task of great curiosity or signal utility It appears necessary however that we attend to the universal qualities of our nature before we regard its varieties or attempt to explain differences consisting in the unequal possession or application of dispositions and powers that are in some measure common to all mankind  MAN like the other animals has certain instinctive propensities which prior to the perception of pleasure or pain and prior to the experience of what is pernicious or useful lead him to perform many functions of nature relative to himself and to his fellowcreatures He has one set of dispositions which refer to his animal preservation and to the continuance of his race another which lead to society and by inlisting him on the side of one tribe or community frequently engage him in war and contention with the rest of mankind His powers of discernment or his intellectual faculties which under the appellation of  reason  are distinguished from the analogous endowments of other animals refer to the objects around him either as they are subjects of mere knowledge or  as they are subjects of approbation or censure He is formed not only to know but likewise to admire and to contemn and these proceedings of his mind have a principal reference to his own character and to that of his fellowcreatures as being the subjects on which he is chiefly concerned to distinguish what is right from what is wrong He enjoys his felicity likewise on certain fixed and determinate conditions and either as an individual apart or as a member of civil society must take a particular course in order to reap the advantages of his nature He is withal in a very high degree susceptible of habits and can by forbearance or exercise so far weaken confirm or even diversify his talents and his dispositions as to appear in a great measure the arbiter of his own rank in nature and the author of all the varities which are exhibited in the actual history of his species The universal characteristics in the mean time to which we have now referred must when we would treat of any part of this history constitute the first subject of our attention and they require not only to be enumerated but to be distinctly considered  THE dispositions which refer to the preservation of the individual while they continue to operate in the manner of instinctive desires are nearly the same in man that they are in the other animals but in him they are sooner or later combined with reflection and foresight they give rise to his apprehensions on the subject of property and make him acquainted with that object of care which he calls his interest Without the instincts which teach the beaver and the squrrel the ant and the bee to make up their little hoards for winter at  first improvident and where no immediate object of passion is near addicted to sloth he becomes in process of time the great storemaster among animals He finds in a provision of wealth which he is probably never to employ an object of his greatest solicitude and the principal idol of his mind He apprehends a relation between his person and his property which renders what he calls his own in a manner a part of himself a constituent of his rank his condition and his character in which independent of any real enjoyment he may be fortunate or unhappy and independent of any personal merit he may be an object of consideration or neglect and in which he may be wounded and injured while his person is safe and every want of his nature completely supplied  IN these apprehensions while other passions only operate occasionally the interested find the object of their ordinary cares their motive to the practice of mechanic and commercial arts their temptation to trespass on the laws of justice and when extremely corrupted the price of their prostitutions and the standard of their opinions on the subject of good and evil Under this influence they would enter if not restrained by the laws of civil society on a scene of violence or meanness which would exhibit our species by turns under an aspect more terrible and odious or more vile and contemptible than that of any animal which inherits the earth  ALTHOUGH the consideration of interest is founded on the experience of animal wants and desires its object is not to gratify any particular appetite but to secure the means of gratifying all and it imposes frequently a restraint on the very desires  from which it arose more powerful and more severe than those of religion or duty It arises from the principles of selfpreservation in the human frame but is a corruption or at least a partial result of those principles and is upon many accounts very improperly termed  selflove  LOVE is an affection which carries the attention of the mind beyond itself and has a quality which we call  tenderness  that never can accompany the considerations of interest This affection being a complacency and a continued satisfaction in its object independent of any external event it has in the midst of disappointment and sorrow pleasures and triumphs unknown to those who act without any regard to their fellowcreatures and in every change of condition it continues entirely distinct from the sentiments which we feel on the subject of personal success or adversity But as the care a man entertains for his own interest and the attention his affection makes him pay to that of another may have similar effects the one on his own fortune the other on that of his friend we confound the principles from which he acts we suppose that they are the same in kind only referred to different objects and we not only misapply the name of love in conjunction with self but in a manner tending to degrade our nature we limit the aim of this supposed selfish affection to the securing or accumulating the constituents of interest or the means of mere animal life  IT is somewhat remarkable that notwithstanding men value themselves so much on qualities of the mind on parts learning and wit on courage generosity and honour those men are still supposed to be in the highest degree selfish or attentive to  themselves who are most careful of animal life and who are least mindful of rendering that life an object worthy of care It will be difficult however to tell why a good understanding a resolute and generous mind should not by every man in his senses be reckoned as much parts of himself as either his stomach or his palate and much more than his estate or his dress The epicure who consults his physician how he may restore his relish for food and by creating an appetite may increase the means of enjoyment might at least with an equal regard to himself consult how he might strengthen his affection to a parent or a child to his country or to mankind and it is probable that an appetite of this sort would prove a source of enjoyment not less than the former  BY our supposed selfish maxims notwithstanding we generally exclude from among the objects of our personal cares many of the happier and more respectable qualities of human nature We consider affection and courage as mere follies that lead us to neglect or expose ourselves we make wisdom consist in a regard to our interest and without explaining what interest means we would have it understood as the only reasonable motive of action with mankind There is even a system of philosophy founded upon tenets of this sort and such is our opinion of what men are likely to do upon selfish principles that we think it must have a tendency very dangerous to virtue But the errors of this system do not consist so much in general principles as in their particular applications not so much in teaching men to regard themselves as in leading them to forget that their happiest affections their candour and their independence  of mind are in reality parts of themselves And the adversaries of this supposed selfish philosophy where it makes selflove the ruling passion with mankind have had reason to find fault not so much with its general representations of human nature as with the obtrusion of a mere innovation in language for a discovery in science  WHEN the vulgar speak of their different motives they are satisfied with ordinary names which refer to known and obvious distinctions Of this kind are the terms  benevolence  and  selfishness  by which they express their desire of the welfare of others or the care of their own The speculative are not always satisfied with this proceeding they would analyze as well as enumerate the principles of nature and the chance is that merely to gain the appearance of something new without any prospect of real advantage they will disturb the order of vulgar apprehension In the case before us they have actually found that benevolence is no more than a species of selflove and would oblige us if possible to look out for a new set of words by which we may distinguish the selfishness of the parent when he takes care of his child from his selfishness when he only takes care of himself For according to this philosophy as in both cases he only means to gratify a desire of his own he is in both cases equally selfish The term  benevolent  in the mean time is not employed to characterise persons who have no desires of their own but persons whose own desires prompt them to procure the welfare of others The fact is that we should need only a fresh supply of language instead of that which by this seeming discovery we should have lost in order to make the reasonings of men proceed  as they formerly did But it is certainly impossible to live and to act with men without employing different names to distinguish the humane from the cruel and the benevolent from the selfish  THESE terms have their equivalents in every tongue they were invented by men of no refinement who only meant to express what they distinctly perceived or strongly felt And if a man of speculation should prove that we are selfish in a sense of his own it does not follow that we are so in the sense of the vulgar or as ordinary men would understand his conclusion that we are condemned in every instance to act on motives of interest covetousness pusillanimity and cowardice for such is conceived to be the ordinary import of selfishness in the character of man  AN affection or passion of any kind is sometimes said to give us an interest in its object and humanity itself gives an interest in the welfare of mankind This term  interest  which commonly implies little more than our regard to property is sometimes put for utility in general and this for happiness insomuch that under these ambiguities it is not surprising we are still unable to determine whether interest is the only motive of human action and the standard by which to distinguish our good from our ill  SO much is said in this place not from any desire to have a share in any controversy of this sort but merely to confine the meaning of the term  interest  to its most common accep ation and to intimate our intention of employing it in expressing  those objects of care which refer to our external condition and the preservation of our animal nature When taken in this sense it will not surely be thought to comprehend at once all the motives of human conduct If men be not allowed to have disinterested benevolence they will not be denied to have disinterested passions of another kind Hatred indignation and rage frequently urge them to act in opposition to their known interest and even to hazard their lives without any hopes of compensation in any future returns of preferment or profit  SECT III  Of the principles of Union among Mankind  MANKIND have always wandered or settled agreed or quarrelled in troops and companies The cause of their assembling whatever it be is the principle of their alliance or union  IN collecting the materials of history we are seldom willing to put up with our subject merely as we find it We are loth to be embarrassed with a multiplicity of particulars and apparent inconsistencies In theory we profess the investigation of general principles and in order to bring the matter of our inquiries within the reach of our comprehension are disposed to adopt any system Thus in treating of human affairs we would draw every consequence from a principle of union or a principle of dissension The state of nature is a state of war or of amity and men are made to unite from a principle of affection or from a principle of fear as is most suitable to the system of different writers The history of our species indeed abundantly shews that they are to one another mutual objects both of fear and of love and they who would prove them to have been originally either in a state of alliance or of war have arguments in store to maintain their assertions Our attachment to one division or to one sect seems often to derive much of its force from an animosity conceived to an opposite one and this animosity in its turn as often arises from a  zeal in behalf of the side we espouse and from a desire to vindicate the rights of our party  MAN is born in society  says Montesquieu  and there he remains  The charms that detain him are known to be manifold We may reckon the parental affection which instead of deserting the adult as among the brutes embraces more close as it becomes mixed with esteem and the memory of its early effects together with a propensity common to man and other animals to mix with the herd and without reflection to follow the croud of his species What this propensity was in the first moment of its operation we know not but with men accustomed to company its enjoyments and disappointments are reckoned among the principal pleasures or pains of human life Sadness and melancholy are connected with solitude gladness and pleasure with the concourse of men The track of a Laplander on the snowy shore gives joy to the lonely mariner and the mute signs of cordiality and kindness which are made to him awaken the memory of pleasures which he felt in society In fine says the writer of a voyage to the north after describing a mute scene of this sort  We were extremely pleased to converse with men since in thirteen months we had seen no human creature  Collection of Dutch voyages    But we need no remote observation to confirm this position The wailings of the infant and the languors of the adult when alone the lively joys of the one and the chearfulness of the other upon the return of company are a sufficient proof of its solid foundations in the frame of our nature  IN accounting for actions we often forget that we ourselves have acted and instead of the sentiments which stimulate the mind in the presence of its object we assign as the motives of conduct with men those considerations which occur in the hours of retirement and cold reflection In this mood frequently we can find nothing important besides the deliberate prospects of interest and a great work like that of forming society must in our apprehension arise from deep reflections and be carried on with a view to the advantages which mankind derive from commerce and mutual support But neither a propensity to mix with the herd nor the sense of advantages enjoyed in that condition comprehend all the principles by which men are united together Those bands are even of a feeble texture when compared to the resolute ardour with which a man adheres to his friend or to his tribe after they have for some time run the career of fortune together Mutual discoveries of generosity joint trials of fortitude redouble the ardours of friendship and kindle a flame in the human breast which the considerations of personal interest or safety cannot suppress The most lively transports of joy are seen and the loudest shrieks of despair are heard when the objects of a tender affection are beheld in a state of triumph or of suffering An Indian recovered his friend unexpectedly on the island of Juan Fernandes He prostrated himself on the ground at his feet  We stood gazing in silence  says Dampier  at this tender scene  If we would know what is the religion of a wild American what it is in his heart that most resembles devotion it is not his fear of the sorcerer nor his  hope of protection from the spirits of the air or the wood it is the ardent affection with which he selects and embraces his friend with which he clings to his side in every season of peril and with which he invokes his spirit from a distance when dangers surprise him alone  Charlevoix Hist Canada  Whatever proofs we may have of the social disposition of man in familiar and contiguous scenes it is possibly of importance to draw our observations from the examples of men who live in the simplest condition and who have not learned to affect what they do not actually feel  MERE acquaintance and habitude nourish affection and the experience of society brings every passion of the human mind upon its side Its triumphs and prosperities its calamities and distresses bring a variety and a force of emotion which can only have place in the company of our fellowcreatures It is here that a man is made to forget his weakness his cares of safety and his subsistence and to act from those passions which make him discover his force It is here he finds that his arrows fly swifter than an eagle and his weapons wound deeper than the paw of the lion or the tooth of the boar It is not alone his sense of a support which is near nor the love of distinction in the opinion of his tribe that inspire his courage or swell his heart with a confidence that exceeds what his natural force should bestow Vehement passions of animosity or attachment are the first exertions of vigour in his breast under their influence every consideration but that of  his object is forgotten dangers and difficulties only excite him the more  THAT condition is surely favourable to the nature of any being in which his force is increased and if courage be the gift of society to man we have reason to consider his union with his species as the noblest part of his fortune From this source are derived not only the force but the very existence of his happiest emotions not only the better part but almost the whole of his rational character Send him to the desert alone he is a plant torn from its roots the form indeed may remain but every faculty droops and withers the human personage and the human character cease to exist  MEN are so far from valuing society on account of its mere external conveniencies that they are commonly most attached where those conveniences are least frequent and are there most faithful where the tribute of their allegiance is paid in blood Affection operates with the greatest force where it meets with the greatest difficulties In the breast of the parent it is most solicitous amidst the dangers and distresses of the child In the breast of a man its flame redoubles where the wrongs or sufferings of his friend or his country require his aid It is in short from this principle alone that we can account for the obstinate attachment of a savage to his unsettled and defenceless tribe when temptations on the side of ease and of safety might induce him to fly from famine and danger to a station more affluent and more secure Hence the sanguine affection which every Greek bore to his country and  hence the devoted patriotism of an early Roman Let those examples be compared with the spirit which reigns in a commercial state where men may be supposed to have experienced in its full extent the interest which individuals have in the preservation of their country It is here indeed if ever that man is sometimes found a detached and solitary being he has found an object which sets him in competition with his fellowcreatures and he deals with them as he does with his cattle and his soil for the sake of the profits they bring The mighty engine which we suppose to have formed society only tends to set its members at variance or to continue their intercourse after the bands of affection are broken  SECT IV  Of the principles of War and Dissension  THERE are some circumstances in the lot of mankind  says Socrates  that shew them to be destined to friendship and amity Those are their mutual need of one another their mutual compassion their sense of mutual benefits and the pleasures arising in company There are other circumstances which prompt them to war and dissension the admiration and the desire which they entertain for the same subjects their opposite pretensions and the provocations which they mutually offer in the course of their competitions  WHEN we endeavour to apply the maxims of natural justice to the solution of difficult questions we find that some cases may be supposed and actually happen where oppositions take place and are lawful prior to any provocation or act of injustice that where the safety and preservation of numbers are mutually inconsistent one party may employ his right of defence before the other has begun an attack And when we join with such examples the instances of mistake and misunderstanding to which mankind are exposed we may be satisfied that war does not always proceed from an intention to injure and that even the best qualities of men their candour as well as their resolution may operate in the midst of their quarrels  THERE is still more to be observed on this subject Mankind not only find in their condition the sources of variance and dissension they appear to have in their minds the seeds of animosity and to embrace the occasions of mutual opposition with alacrity and pleasure In the most pacific situation there are few who have not their enemies as well as their friends and who are not pleased with opposing the proceedings of one as much as with favouring the designs of another Small and simple tribes who in their domestic society have the firmest union are in their state of opposition as separate nations frequently animated with the most implacable hatred Among the citizens of Rome in the early ages of that republic the name of a foreigner and that of an enemy were the same Among the Greeks the name of Barbarian under which that people comprehended every nation that was of a race and spoke a language different from their own became a term of indiscriminate contempt and aversion Even where no particular claim to superiority is formed the repugnance to union the frequent wars or rather the perpetual hostilities which take place among rude nations and separate clans discover how much our species is disposed to opposition as well as to concert  LATE discoveries have brought us to the knowledge of almost every situation in which mankind are placed We have found them spread over large and extensive continents where communications are open and where national confederacy might be easily formed We have found them in narrower districts circumscribed by mountains  great rivers and arms of the sea They have been found in small and remote islands where the inhabitants might be easily assembled and derive an advantage from their union But in all those situations alike they were broke into cantons and affected a distinction of name and community The titles of  fellowcitizen  and  countryman  unopposed to those of  alien  and  foreigner  to which they refer would fall into disuse and lose their meaning We love individuals on account of personal qualities but we love our country as it is a party in the divisions of mankind and our zeal for its interest is a predilection in behalf of the side we maintain  IN the promiscuous concourse of men it is sufficient that we have an opportunity of selecting our company We turn away from those who do not engage us and we fix our resort where the society is more to our mind We are fond of distinctions we place ourselves in opposition and quarrel under the denominations of faction and party without any material subject of controversy Aversion like affection is fostered by a continued direction to its particular object Separation and estrangement as well as opposition widen a breach which did not owe its beginnings to any offence And it would seem that till we have reduced mankind to the state of a family or found some external consideration to maintain their connection in greater numbers they will be for ever separated into bands and form a plurality of nations  THE sense of a common danger and the assaults of an enemy have been frequently useful to nations by uniting their members more firmly together and by preventing the secessions and  actual separations in which their civil discord might otherwise terminate And this motive to union which is offered from abroad may be necessary not only in the case of large and extensive nations where coalitions are weakened by distance and the distinction of provincial names but even in the narrow society of the smallest states Rome itself was founded by a small party which took its flight from Alba her citizens were often in danger of separating and if the villages and cantons of the Volsci had been further removed from the scene of their dissensions the Mons Sacer might have received a new colony before the mothercountry was ripe for such a discharge She continued long to feel the quarrels of her nobles and her people and the gates of Janus were frequently opened to remind her inhabitants of the duties they owed to their country  IF societies as well as individuals be charged with the care of their own preservation and if in both we apprehend a separation of interest which may give rise to jealousies and competitions we cannot be surprised to find hostilities arise from this source But were there no angry passions of a different sort the animosities which attend an opposition of interest should bear a proportion to the supposed value of the subject  The Hottentot nations  says Kolben  trespass on one another by thefts of cattle and of women but such injuries are seldom committed except with a view to exasperate their neighbours and bring them to a war  Such depredations then are not the foundation of a war but the effects of a hostile intention already conceived The nations of North America who have no herds to preserve nor settlements to defend are yet engaged  in almost perpetual wars for which they can assign no reason but the point of honour and a desire to continue the struggle their fathers maintained They do not regard the spoils of an enemy and the warrior who has seized any booty easily parts with it to the first person who comes in his way  See Charlevoix's history of Canada    BUT we need not cross the Atlantic to find proofs of animosity and to observe in the collision of separate societies the influence of angry passions that do not arise from an opposition of interest Human nature has no part of its character of which more flagrant examples are given on this side of the globe What is it that stirs in the breasts of ordinary men when the enemies of their country are named Whence are the prejudices that subsist between different provinces cantons and villages of the same empire and territory What is it that excites one half of the nations of Europe against the other The statesman may explain his conduct on motives of national jealousy and caution but the people have dislikes and antipathies for which they cannot account Their mutual reproaches of perfidy and injustice like the Hottentot depredations are but symptoms of an animosity and the language of a hostile disposition already conceived The charge of cowardice and pusillanimity qualities which the interested and cautious enemy should of all others like best to find in his rival is urged with aversion and made the ground of dislike Hear the peasants on different sides of the Alps and the  Pyrenees the Rhine or the British channel give vent to their prejudices and national passions it is among them that we find the materials of war and dissension laid without the direction of government and sparks ready to kindle into a flame which the statesman is frequently disposed to extinguish The fire will not always catch where his reasons of state would direct nor stop where the concurrence of interest has produced an alliance  My Father  said a Spanish peasant  would rise from his grave if he could foresee a war with France  What interest had he or the bones of his father in the quarrels of princes  THESE observations seem to arraign our species and to give an unfavourable picture of mankind and yet the particulars we have mentioned are consistent with the most amiable qualities of our nature and often furnish a scene for the exercise of our greatest abilities They are sentiments of generosity and selfdenial that animate the warrior in defence of his country and they are dispositions most favourable to mankind that become the principles of apparent hostility to men Every animal is made to delight in the exercise of his natural talents and forces The lion and the tyger sport with the paw the horse delights to commit his mane to the wind and forgets his pasture to try his speed in the field the bull even before his brow is armed and the lamb while yet an emblem of innocence have a disposition to strike with the forehead and anticipate in play the conflicts they are doomed to sustain Man too is disposed to opposition and to employ the forces of his nature against an equal antagonist he loves to bring his reason his eloquence his  courage even his bodily strength to the proof His sports are frequently an image of war sweat and blood are freely expended in play and fractures or death are often made to terminate the pastimes of idleness and festivity He was not made to live for ever and even his love of amusement has opened a path that leads to the grave  WITHOUT the rivalship of nations and the practice of war civil society itself could scarcely have found an object or a form Mankind might have traded without any formal convention but they cannot be safe without a national concert The necessity of a public defence has given rise to many departments of state and the intellectual talents of men have found their busiest scene in wielding their national forces To overawe or intimidate or when we cannot persuade with reason to resist with fortitude are the occupations which give its most animating exercise and its greatest triumphs to a vigorous mind and he who has never struggled with his fellowcreatures is a stranger to half the sentiments of mankind  THE quarrels of individuals indeed are frequently the operations of unhappy and detestable passions malice hatred and rage If such passions alone possess the breast the scene of dissension becomes an object of horror but a common opposition maintained by numbers is always allayed by passions of another sort Sentiments of affection and friendship mix with animosity the active and strenuous become the guardians of their society and violence itself is in their case an exertion of generosity as well as of courage We applaud as proceeding from a national or party  spirit what we could not endure as the effect of a private dislike and amidst the competitions of rival states think we have found for the patriot and the warrior in the practice of violence and stratagem the most illustrious career of human virtue Even personal opposition here does not divide our judgment on the merits of men The rival names of Agesilaus and Epaminondas of Scipio and Hannibal are repeated with equal praise and war itself which in one view appears so fatal in another is the exercise of a liberal spirit and in the very effects which we regret is but one distemper more by which the author of nature has appointed our exit from human life  THESE reflections may open our view into the state of mankind but they tend to reconcile us to the conduct of Providence rather than to make us change our own where from a regard to the welfare of our fellowcreatures we endeavour to pacify their animosities and unite them by the ties of affection In the pursuit of this amiable intention we may hope in some instances to disarm the angry passions of jealousy and envy we may hope to instil into the breasts of private men sentiments of candour toward their fellowcreatures and a disposition to humanity and justice But it is vain to expect that we can give to the multitude of a people a sense of union among themselves without admitting hostility to those who oppose them Could we at once in the case of any nation extinguish the emulation which is excited from abroad we should probably break or weaken the bands of society at home and close the busiest scenes of national occupations and virtues  SECT V  Of Intellectual Powers  MANY attempts have been made to analyze the dispositions which we have now enumerated but one purpose of science perhaps the most important is served when the existence of a disposition is established We are more concerned in its reality and in its consequences than we are in its origin or manner of formation  THE same observation may be applied to the other powers and faculties of our nature Their existence and use are the principal objects of our study Thinking and reasoning we say are the operations of some faculty but in what manner the faculties of thought or reason remain when they are not exerted or by what difference in the frame they are unequal in different persons are questions which we cannot resolve Their operations alone discover them when unapplied they lie hid even from the person to whom they pertain and their action is so much a part of their nature that the faculty itself in many cases is scarcely to be distinguished from a habit acquired in its frequent exertion  PERSONS who are occupied with different subjects who act in different scenes generally appear to have different talents or at least to have the same faculties variously formed and suited to different purposes The peculiar genius of nations as well as of individuals may in this manner arise from the state of their fortunes And  it is proper that we endeavour to find some rule by which to judge of what is admirable in the capacities of men or fortunate in the application of their faculties before we venture to pass a judgment on this branch of their merits or pretend to measure the degree of respect they may claim by their different attainments  TO receive the informations of sense is perhaps the earliest function of an animal combined with an intellectual nature and one great accomplishment of the living agent consists in the force and sensibility of his animal organs The pleasures or pains to which he is exposed from this quarter constitute to him an important difference between the objects which are thus brought to his knowledge and it concerns him to distinguish well before he commits himself to the direction of appetite He must scrutinize the objects of one sense by the perceptions of another examine with the eye before he ventures to touch and employ every means of observation before he gratifies the appetites of thirst and of hunger A discernment acquired by experience becomes a faculty of his mind and the inferences of thought are sometimes not to be distinguished from the perceptions of sense  THE objects around us beside their separate appearances have their relations to one another They suggest when compared what would not occur when they are considered apart they have their effects and mutual influences they exhibit in like circumstances similar operations and uniform consequences When we have found and expressed the points in which the uniformity  of their operations consists we have ascertained a physical law Many such laws and even the most important are known to the vulgar and occur upon the smallest degrees of reflection but others are hid under a seeming confusion which ordinary talents cannot remove and are therefore the objects of study long observation and superior capacity The faculties of penetration and judgement are by men of business as well as of science employed to unravel intricacies of this sort and the degree of sagacity with which either is endowed is to be measured by the success with which they are able to find general rules applicable to a variety of cases that seemed to have nothing in common and to discover important distinctions between subjects which the vulgar are apt to confound  TO collect a multiplicity of particulars under general heads and to refer a variety of operations to their common principle is the object of science To do the same thing at least within the range of his active engagements pertains to the man of pleasure or business and it would seem that the studious and the active are so far employed in the same task from observation and experience to find the general views under which their objects may be considered and the rules which may be usefully applied in the detail of their conduct They do not always apply their talents to different subjects and they seem to be distinguished chiefly by the unequal reach and variety of their remarks or by the intentions which they severally have in collecting them  WHILST men continue to act from appetites and passions leading to the attainment of external ends they seldom quit the view of their objects in detail to go far in the road of general inquiries They measure the extent of their own abilities by the promptitude with which they apprehend what is important in every subject and the facility with which they extricate themselves on every trying occasion And these it must be confessed to a being who is destined to act in the midst of difficulties are the proper test of capacity and force The parade of words and general reasonings which sometime carry an appearance of so much learning and knowledge are of little avail in the conduct of life The talents from which they proceed terminate in mere ostentation and are seldom connected with that superior discernment which the active apply in times of perplexity much less with that intrepidity and force of mind which are required in passing through difficult scenes  THE abilities of active men however have a variety corresponding to that of the subjects on which they are occupied A sagacity applied to external and inanimate nature forms one species of capacity that which is turned to society and human affairs another Reputation for parts in any scene is equivocal till we know by what kind of exertion that reputation is gained That they understand well the subjects to which they apply is all that can be said in commending men of the greatest abilities and every department every profession would have its great men if there were not a choice of objects for the understanding  and of talents for the mind as well as of sentiments for the heart and of habits for the active character  THE meanest professions indeed so far sometimes forget themselves or the rest of mankind as to arrogate in commending what is distinguished in their own way every epithet the most respectable claim as the right of superior abilities Every mechanic is a great man with the learner and the humble admirer in his particular calling and we can perhaps with more assurance pronounce what it is that should make a man happy and amiable than what should make his abilities respected and his genius admired This upon a view of the talents themselves may perhaps be impossible The effect however will point out the rule and the standard of our judgement To be admired and respected is to have an ascendant among men The talents which most directly procure that ascendant are those which operate on mankind penetrate their views prevent their wishes or srustrate their designs The superior capacity leads with a superior energy where every individual would go and shews the hesitating and the irresolute a clear passage to the attainment of their ends  THIS description does not pertain to any particular craft or profession or perhaps it implies a kind of ability which the separate application of men to particular callings only tends to suppress or to weaken Where shall we find the talents which are fit to act with men in a collective body if we break that body into parts and confine the observation of each to a separate track  TO act in the view of his fellowcreatures to produce his mind in public to give it all the exercise of sentiment and thought which pertain to man as a member of society as a friend or an enemy seems to be the principal calling and occupation of his nature If he must labour that he may subsist he can subsist for no better purpose than the good of mankind nor can he have better talents than those which qualify him to act with men Here indeed the understanding appears to borrow very much from the passions and there is a felicity of conduct in human affairs in which it is difficult to distinguish the promptitude of the head from the ardour and sensibility of the heart Where both are united they constitute that superiority of mind the frequency of which among men in particular ages and nations much more than the progress they have made in speculation or in the practice of mechanic and liberal arts should determine the rate of their genius and assign the palm of distinction and honour  WHEN nations succeed one another in the career of discoveries and inquiries the last is always the most knowing Systems of science are gradually formed The globe itself is traversed by degrees and the history of every age when past is an accession of knowledge to those who succeed The Romans were more knowing than the Greeks and every scholar of modern Europe is in this sense more learned than the most accomplished person that ever bore either of those celebrated names But is he on that account their superior  MEN are to be estimated not from what they know but from what they are able to perform from their skill in adapting materials to the several purposes of life from their vigour and conduct in pursuing the objects of policy and in finding the expedients of war and national defence Even in literature they are to be estimated from the works of their genius not from the extent of their knowledge The scene of mere observation was extremely limited in a Grecian republic and the bustle of an active life appeared inconsistent with study but there the human mind notwithstanding collected its greatest abilities and received its best informations in the midst of sweat and of dust  IT is peculiar to modern Europe to rest so much of the human character on what may be learned in retirement and from the information of books A just admiration of ancient literature an opinion that human sentiment and human reason without this aid were to have vanished from the societies of men have led us into the shade where we endeavour to derive from imagination and thought what is in reality matter of experience and sentiment and we endeavour through the grammar of dead languages and the channel of commentators to arrive at the beauties of thought and elocution which sprang from the animated spirit of society and were taken from the living impressions of an active life Our attainments are frequently limited to the elements of every science and seldom reach to that enlargement of ability and power which useful knowledge should give Like mathematicians who study the Elements  of Euclid but never think of mensuration we read of societies but do not propose to act with men we repeat the language of politics but feel not the spirit of nations we attend to the formalities of a military discipline but know not how to employ numbers of men to obtain any purpose by stratagem or force  BUT for what end it may be said is it to point out a misfortune that cannot be remedied If national affairs called for exertion the genius of men would awake but in the recess of better employment the time which is bestowed on study if even attended with no other advantage serves to occupy with innocence the hours of leisure and set bounds to the pursuit of ruinous and frivolous amusements From no better reason than this we employ so many of our early years under the rod to acquire what it is not expected we should retain beyond the threshold of the school and whilst we carry the same frivolous character in our studies that we do in our amusements the human mind could not suffer more from a contempt of letters than it does from the false importance which is given to literature as a business for life not as a help to our conduct and the means of forming a character that may be happy in itself and useful to mankind  IF that time which is passed in relaxing the powers of the mind and in withholding every object but what tends to weaken and to corrupt were employed in fortifying those powers and in teaching the mind to recognise its objects and its strength we should not at the years of maturity  be so much at a loss for occupation nor in attending the chances of a gamingtable misemploy our talents or waste the fire which remains in the breast They at least who by their stations have a share in the government of their country might believe themselves capable of business and while the state had its armies and councils might find objects enough to amuse without throwing a personal fortune into hazard merely to cure the yawnings of a listless and insignificant life It is impossible for ever to maintain the tone of speculation it is impossible not sometimes to feel that we live among men  SECT VI  Of Moral Sentiment  UPON a slight observation of what passes in human life we should be apt to conclude that the care of subsistence is the principal spring of human actions This consideration leads to the invention and practice of mechanical arts it serves to distinguish amusement from business and with many scarcely admits into competition any other subject of pursuit or attention The mighty advantages of property and fortune when stript of the recommendations they derive from vanity or the more serious regards to independence and power only mean a provision that is made for animal enjoyment and if our solicitude on this subject were removed not only the toils of the mechanic but the studies of the learned would cease every department of public business would become unnecessary every senatehouse would be shut up and every palace deserted  IS man therefore in respect to his object to be classed with the mere brutes and only to be distinguished by faculties that qualify him to multiply contrivances for the support and convenience of animal life and by the extent of a fancy that renders the care of animal preservation to him more burdensome than it is to the herd with which he shares in the bounty of nature If this were his case the joy which attends on success or the griefs which arise from disappointment would make the sum of his passions The torrent that wasted or  the inundation that enriched his possessions would give him all the emotion with which he is seized on the occasion of a wrong by which his fortunes are impaired or of a benefit by which they are preserved and enlarged His fellowcreatures would be considered merely as they affected his interest Profit or loss would serve to mark the event of every transaction and the epithets  useful  or  detrimental  would serve to distinguish his mates in society as they do the tree which bears plenty of fruit from that which serves only to cumber the ground or intercept his view  THIS however is not the history of our species What comes from a fellowcreature is received with peculiar attention and every language abounds with terms that express somewhat in the transactions of men different from success and disappointment The bosom kindles in company while the point of interest in view has nothing to inflame and a matter frivolous in itself becomes important when it serves to bring to light the intentions and characters of men The soreigner who believed that Othello on the stage was enraged for the loss of his handkerchief was not more mistaken than the reasoner who imputes any of the more vehement passions of men to the impressions of mere profit or loss  MEN assemble to deliberate on business they separate from jealousies of interest but in their several collisions whether as friends or as enemies a fire is struck out which the regards to interest or safety cannot confine The value of a favour is not measured when sentiments of kindness are perceived  and the term  misfortune  has but a feeble meaning when compared to that of  insult  and  wrong  AS actors or spectators we are perpetually made to feel the difference of human conduct and from a bare recital of transactions which have passed in ages and countries remote from our own are moved with admiration and pity or transported with indignation and rage Our sensibility on this subject gives their charm in retirement to the relations of history and to the fictions of poetry sends forth the tear of compassion gives to the blood its briskest movement and to the eye its liveliest glances of displeasure or joy It turns human life into an interesting spectacle and perpetually solicits even the indolent to mix as opponents or friends in the scenes which are acted before them Joined to the powers of deliberation and reason it constitutes the basis of a moral nature and whilst it dictates the terms of praise and of blame serves to class our fellowcreatures by the most admirable and engaging or the most odious and contemptible denominations  IT is pleasant to find men who in their speculations deny the reality of moral distinctions forget in detail the general positions they maintain and give loose to ridicule indignation and scorn as if any of these sentiments could have place were the actions of men indifferent and with acrimony pretend to detect the fraud by which moral restraints have been imposed as if to censure a fraud were not already to take a part on the side of morality  Mandeville    CAN we explain the principles upon which mankind adjudge the preference of characters and upon which they indulge such vehement emotions of admiration or contempt If it be admitted that we cannot are the facts less true or must we suspend the movements of the heart until they who are employed in framing systems of science have discovered the principle from which those movements proceed If a finger burn we care not for information on the properties of fire if the heart be torn or the mind overjoyed we have not leisure for speculations on the subject of moral sensibility  IT is fortunate in this as in other articles to which speculation and theory are applied that nature proceeds in her course whilst the curious are busied in the search of her principles The peasant or the child can reason and judge and speak his language with a discernment a consistency and a regard to analogy which perplex the logician the moralist and the grammarian when they would find the principle upon which the proceeding is founded or when they would bring to general rules what is so familiar and so well sustained in particular cases The felicity of our conduct is more owing to the talent we possess for detail and to the suggestion of particular occasions than it is to any direction we can find in theory and general speculations  WE must in the result of every inquiry encounter with facts which we cannot explain and to bear with this mortification would save us frequently a great deal of fruitless trouble Together  with the sense of our existence we must admit many circumstances which come to our knowledge at the same time and in the same manner and which do in reality constitute the mode of our being Every peasant will tell us that a man hath his rights and that to trespass on those rights is injustice If we ask him farther what he means by the term  right  we probably force him to substitute a less significant or less proper term in the place of this or require him to account for what is an original mode of his mind and a sentiment to which he ultimately refers when he would explain himself upon any particular application of his language  THE rights of individuals may relate to a variety of subjects and be comprehended under different heads Prior to the establishment of property and the distinction of ranks men have a right to defend their persons and to act with freedom they have a right to maintain the apprehensions of reason and the feelings of the heart and they cannot for a moment converse with one another without feeling that the part they maintain may be just or unjust It is not however our business here to carry the notion of a right into its several applications but to reason on the sentiment of favour with which that notion is entertained in the mind  IF it be true that men are united by instinct that they act in society from affections of kindness and friendship if it be true that even prior to acquaintance and habitude men as such are commonly to one another objects of attention and some degree of regard that while their prosperity  is beheld with indifference their afflictions are considered with commiseration if calamities be measured by the numbers and the qualities of men they involve and if every suffering of a fellowcreature draws a croud of attentive spectators if even in the case of those to whom we do not habitually wish any positive good we are still averse to be the instruments of harm it should seem that in these various appearances of an amicable disposition the foundations of a moral apprehension are sufficiently laid and the sense of a right which we maintain for ourselves is by a movement of humanity and candour extended to our fellowcreatures  WHAT is it that prompts the tongue when we censure an act of cruelty or oppression What is it that constitutes our restraint from offences that tend to distress our fellowcreatures It is probably in both cases a particular application of that principle which in presence of the sorrowful sends forth the tear of compassion and a combination of all those sentiments which constitute a benevolent disposition and if not a resolution to do good at least an aversion to be the instrument of harm  Mankind we are told are devoted to interest and this in all commercial nations is undoubtedly true but it does not follow that they are by their natural dispositions averse to society and mutual affection proofs of the contrary remain even where interest triumphs most What must we think of the force of that disposition to compassion to candour and good will which notwithstanding the prevailing opinion that the happiness of a man consists in possessing the greatest possible share of riches preferments and honours still keeps the parties who are in competition for those objects on a tolerable footing of amity and leads them to abstain even from their own supposed good when their seizing it appears in the light of a dettiment to others What might we not expect from the human heart in circumstances which prevented this apprehension on the subject of fortune or under the influence of an opinion as steady and general as the former that human felicity does not consist in the indulgences of animal appetite but in those of a benevolent heart not in fortune or interest but in the contempt of this very object in the courage and freedom which arise from this contempt joined to a resolute choice of conduct directed to the good of mankind or to the good of that particular society to which the party belongs    IT may be difficult however to enumerate the motives of all the censures and commendations which are applied to the actions of men Even while we moralize every disposition of the human mind may have its share in forming the judgement and in prompting the tongue As jealousy is often the most watchful guardian of chastity so malice is often the quickest to spy the failings of our neighbour Envy affectation and vanity may dictate the verdicts we give and the worst principles of our nature may be at the bottom of our pretended zeal for morality but if we only mean to inquire why they who are well disposed to mankind apprehend in every instance certain rights pertaining to their fellowcreatures and why they applaud the consideration that is paid to those rights we cannot perhaps assign a better reason than that the person who applauds is well disposed to the welfare of the parties to whom his applauses refer  WHEN we consider that the reality of any amicable propensity in the human mind has been frequently contested when we recollect the prevalence of interested competitions with their attendant passions of jealousy envy and malice it may seem strange to alledge that love and compassion are the most powerful principles in the human breast but they are destined on many occasions to urge with the most irresistible vehemence and if the desire of selfpreservation be more constant and more uniform these are a more plentiful source of enthusiasm satisfaction and joy With a power not inferior to that of resentment and rage they hurry the mind into every sacrifice of interest and bear it undismayed through every hardship and danger  THE disposition on which friendship is grafted glows with satisfaction in the hours of tranquillity and is pleasant not only in its triumphs but even in its sorrows It throws a grace on the external air and by its expression on the countenance compensates for the want of beauty or gives a charm which no complexion or features can equal From this source the scenes of human life derive their principal felicity and their imitations in poetry their principal ornament Descriptions of nature even representations of a vigorous conduct and a manly courage do not engage the heart if they be not mixed with the exhibition of generous sentiments and the pathetic which is found to arise in the struggles the triumphs or the misfortunes of a tender affection The death of Polites in the Aeneid is not more affecting than that of many others who perished in the ruins of Troy  but the aged Priam was present when this last of his sons was slain and the agonies of grief and sorrow force the parent from his retreat to fall by the hand that shed the blood of his child The pathetic of Homer consists in exhibiting the force of affections not in exciting mere terror and pity passions he has never perhaps in any instance attempted to raise  WITH this tendency to kindle into enthusiasm with this command over the heart with the pleasure that attends its emotions and with all its effects in meriting confidence and procuring esteem it is not surprising that a principle of humanity should give the tone to our commendations and our censures and even where it is hindered from directing our conduct should still give to the mind on reflection its knowledge of what is desirable in the human character  What hast thou done with thy brother Abel  was the first expostulation in behalf of morality and if the first answer has been often repeated mankind have notwithstanding in one sense sufficiently acknowledged the charge of their nature They have felt they have talked and even acted as the keepers of their fellowcreatures They have made the indications of candour and mutual affection the test of what is meritorious and amiable in the characters of men They have made cruelty and oppression the principal objects of their indignation and rage Even while the head is occupied with projects of interest the heart is often seduced into friendship and while business proceeds on the maxims of selfpreservation the careless hour is employed in generosity and kindness  HENCE the rule by which men commonly judge of external actions is taken from the supposed influence of such actions on the general good To abstain from harm is the great law of natural justice to diffuse happiness is the law of morality and when we censure the conferring a favour on one or a few at the expence of many we refer to public utility as the great object at which the actions of men should be aimed  AFTER all it must be confessed that if a principle of affection to mankind be the basis of our moral approbation and dislike we sometimes proceed in distributing applause or censure without precisely attending to the degree in which our fellowcreatures are hurt or obliged and that besides the virtues of candour friendship generosity and public spirit which bear an immediate reference to this principle there are others which may seem to derive their commendation from a different source Temperance prudence fortitude are those qualities likewise admired from a principle of regard to our fellowcreatures Why not since they render men happy in themselves and useful to others He who is qualified to promote the welfare of mankind is neither a sot a fool nor a coward Can it be more clearly expressed that temperance prudence and fortitude are necessary to the character we love and admire I know well why I should wish for them in myself and why likewise I should wish for them in my friend and in every person who is an object of my affection But to what purpose seek for reasons of approbation where qualities are so necessary to our happiness and so great a part in the perfection of our  nature We must cease to esteem ourselves and to distinguish what is excellent when such qualifications incur our neglect  A PERSON of an affectionate mind possessed of a maxim That he himself as an individual is no more than a part of the whole that demands his regard has found in that principle a sufficient foundation for all the virtues for a contempt of animal pleasures that would supplant his principal enjoyment for an equal contempt of danger or pain that come to stop his pursuits of public good  A vehement and steady affection magnifies its object and lessens every difficulty or danger that stands in the way  Ask those who have been in love  says Epictetus  they will know that I speak truth  I HAVE before me  says another eminent moralist  Persian Letters    an idea of justice which if I could follow in every instance I should think myself the most happy of men  And it is perhaps of consequence to their happiness as well as to their conduct if those can be disjoined that men should have this idea properly formed It is perhaps but another name for that good of mankind which the virtuous are engaged to promote If virtue be the supreme good its best and most signal effect is to communicate and diffuse itself  TO love and even to hate on the apprehension of moral qualities to espouse one party from a sense of justice to oppose another with indignation  excited by iniquity are the common indications of probity and the operations of an animated upright and generous spirit To guard against unjust partialities and illgrounded antipathies to maintain that composure of mind which without impairing its sensibility or ardour proceeds in every instance with discernment and penetration are the marks of a vigorous and cultivated spirit To be able to follow the dictates of such a Spirit through all the varieties of human life and with a mind always master of itself in prosperity or adversity and possessed of all its abilities when the subjects in hazard are life or freedom as much as in treating simple questions of interest are the triumphs of magnanimity and true elevation of mind  The event of the day is decided Draw this javelin from my body now  said Epaminondas  and let me bleed  IN what situation or by what instruction is this wonderful character to be formed Is it found in the nurseries of affectation pertness and vanity from which fashion is propagated and the genteel is announced in great and opulent cities where men view with one another in equipage dress and the reputation of fortune Is it within the admired precincts of a court where we may learn to smile without being pleased to caress without affection to wound with the secret weapons of envy and jealousy and to rest our personal importance on circumstances which we cannot always with honour command No but in a situation where the great sentiments of the heart are awakened where the characters of men not their situations and fortunes are the principal distinction where the anxieties of interest or vanity perish in the blaze of  more vigorous emotions and where the human soul having felt and recognised its objects like an animal who has tasted the blood of his prey cannot descend to pursuits that leave its talents and its force unemployed  PROPER occasions alone operating on a raised and a happy disposition may produce this admirable effect whilst mere instruction may always find mankind at a loss to comprehend its meaning or insensible to its dictates The case however is not desperate till we have formed our system of politics as well as manners till we have sold our freedom for titles equipage and distinctions till we see no merit but prosperity and power no disgrace but poverty and neglect What charm of instruction can cure the mind that is tainted with this disorder What syren voice can awaken a desire of freedom that is held to be meanness and a want of ambition or what persuasion can turn the grimace of politeness into real sentiments of humanity and candour  SECT VII  Of Happiness  HAVING had under our consideration the active powers and the moral qualities which distinguish the nature of man is it still necessary that we should treat of his happiness apart This significant term the most frequent and the most familiar in our conversation is perhaps on reflection the least understood It serves to express our satisfaction when any desire is gratified It is pronounced with a sigh when our object is distant It means what we wish to obtain and what we seldom stay to examine We estimate the value of every subject by its utility and its influence on happiness but we think that utility itself and happiness require no explanation  THOSE men are commonly esteemed the happiest whose desires are most frequently gratified But if in reality the possession of what we desire and a continued fruition were requisite to happiness mankind for the most part would have reason to complain of their lot What they call their enjoyments are generally momentary and the object of sanguine expectation when obtained no longer continues to occupy the mind A new passion succeeds and the imagination as before is intent on a distant felicity  HOW many reflections of this sort are suggested by melancholy or by the effects of that very languor and inoccupation into which we would willingly  sink under the notion of freedom from care and trouble  WHEN we enter on a formal computation of the enjoyments or sufferings which are prepared for mankind it is a chance but we find that pain by its intenseness its duration or frequency is greatly predominant The activity and eagerness with which we press from one stage of life to another our unwillingness to return on the paths we have trod our aversion in age to renew the frolics of youth or to repeat in manhood the amusements of children have been accordingly stated as proofs that our memory of the past and our feeling of the present are equal subjects of dislike and displeasure  Maupertuis Essai de Morale    THIS conclusion however like many others drawn from our supposed knowledge of causes does not correspond with experience In every street in every village in every field the greater number of persons we meet carry an aspect that is chearful or thoughtless indifferent composed busy or animated The labourer whistles to his team and the mechanic is at ease in his calling the frolicsome and the gay feel a series of pleasures of which we know not the source even they who demonstrate the miseries of human life when intent on their argument escape from their sorrows and find a tolerable pastime in proving that men are unhappy  THE very terms  pleasure  and  pain  perhaps are equivocal but if they are confined as they  appear to be in many of our reasonings to the mere sensations which have a reference to external objects either in the memory of the past the feeling of the present or the apprehension of the future it is a great error to suppose that they comprehend all the constituents of happiness or misery or that the good humour of an ordinary life is maintained by the prevalence of those pleasures which have their separate names and are on reflection distinctly remembered  THE mind during the greater part of its existence is employed in active exertions not in merely attending to its own feelings of pleasure or pain and the list of its faculties understanding memory foresight sentiment will and intention only contains the names of its different operations  IF in the absence of every sensation to which we commonly give the names either of  enjoyment  or  suffering  our very existence may have its opposite qualities of  bappiness  or  misery  and if what we call  pleasure  or  pain  occupies but a small part of human life compared to what passes in contrivance and execution in pursuits and expectations in conduct reflection and social engagements it must appear that our active pursuits at least on account of their duration deserve the greater part of our attention When their occasions have failed the demand is not for pleasure but for something to do and the very complaints of a sufferer are not so sure a mark of distress as the stare of the languid  WE seldom however reckon any task which we are bound to perform among the blessings of life We always aim at a period of pure enjoyment or a termination of trouble and overlook the source from which most of our present satisfactions are really drawn Ask the busy Where is the happiness to which they aspire they will answer perhaps That it is to be found in the object of some present pursuit If we ask Why they are not miserable in the absence of that happiness they will say That they hope to attain it But is it hope alone that supports the mind in the midst of precarious and uncertain prospects and would assurance of success fill the intervals of expectation with more pleasing emotions Give the huntsman his prey give the gamester the gold which is staked on the game that the one may not need to fatigue his person nor the other to perplex his mind and both will probably laugh at our folly the one will stake his money anew that he may be perplexed the other will turn his stag to the field that he may hear the cry of the dogs and follow through danger and hardship Withdraw the occupations of men terminate their desires existence is a burden and the iteration of memory is a torment  THE men of this country says one lady should learn to sow and to knit it would hinder their time from being a burden to themselves and to other people That is true says another for my part though I never look abroad I tremble at the prospect of bad weather for then the gentlemen come mopping to us for entertainment and the sight of a husband in distress is but a melancholy spectacle  IN devising or in executing a plan in being carried on the tide of emotion and sentiment the mind seems to unfold its being and to enjoy itself Even where the end and the object are known to be of little avail the talents and the fancy are often intensely applied and business or play may amuse them alike We only desire repose to recruit our limited and our wasting force when business fatigues amusement is often but a change of occupation We are not always unhappy even when we complain There is a kind of affliction which makes an agreeable state of the mind and lamentation itself is sometimes an expression of pleasure The painter and the poet have laid hold of this handle and find among the means of entertainment a favourable reception for works that are composed to awaken our sorrows  TO a being of this description therefore it is a blessing to meet with incentives to action whether in the desire of pleasure or the aversion to pain His activity is of more importance than the very pleasure he seeks and langour a greater evil than the suffering he shuns  THE gratifications of animal appetite are of short duration and sensuality is but a distemper of the mind which ought to be cured by remembrance if it were not perpetually inflamed by hope The chace is not more surely terminated by the death of the game than the joys of the voluptuary by the means of completing his debauch As a bond of society as a matter of distant pursuit the objects of sense make an important part in the system of human life They lead us to  fulfil the purpose of nature in preserving the individual and in perpetuating the species but to rely on their use as a principal constituent of human felicity were an error in speculation and would be still more an error in practice Even the master of the seraglio for whom all the treasures of empire are extorted from the hoards of its frighted inhabitants for whom alone the choicest emerald and the diamond are drawn from the mine for whom every breeze is enriched with perfumes for whom beauty is assembled from every quarter and animated by passions that ripen under the vertical sun is confined to the grate for his use is still perhaps more wretched than the very herd of the people whose labours and properties are devoted to relieve him of trouble and to procure him enjoyment  SENSUALITY is easily overcome by any of the habits of pursuit which usually engage an active mind When curiosity is awake or when passion is excited even in the midst of the feast when conversation grows warm grows jovial or serious the pleasures of the table we know are forgotten The boy contemns them for play and the man of age declines them for business  WHEN we reckon the circumstances that correspond to the nature of any animal or to that of man in particular such as safety shelter food and the other means of enjoyment or preservation we sometimes think that we have found a sensible and a solid foundation on which to rest his felicity But those who are least disposed to moralize observe that happiness is not connected with fortune although fortune includes at once all the  means of subsistence and the means of sensual indulgence The circumstances that require abstinence courage and conduct expose us to hazard and are in description of the painful kind yet the able the brave and the ardent seem most to enjoy themselves when placed in the midst of difficulties and obliged to employ the powers they possess  SPINOLA being told that Sir Francis Vere died of having nothing to do said  That was enough to kill a general  Life of Lord Herbert    How many are there to whom war itself is a pastime who chuse the life of a soldier exposed to dangers and continued fatigues of a mariner in conflict with every hardship and bereft of every conveniency of a politician whose sport is the conduct of parties and factions and who rather than be idle will do the business of men and of nations for whom he has not the smallest regard Such men do not chuse pain as preferable to pleasure but they are incited by a restless disposition to make continued exertions of capacity and resolution they triumph in the midst of their struggles they droop and they languish when the occasion of their labour has ceased  WHAT was enjoyment in the sense of that youth who according to Tacitus loved danger itself not the rewards of courage What is the prospect of pleasure when the sound of the horn or the trumpet the cry of the dogs or the shout of war awaken the ardour of the sportsman and  the soldier The most animating occasions of human life are calls to danger and hardship not invitations to safety and ease and man himself in his excellence is not an animal of pleasure nor destined merely to enjoy what the elements bring to his use but like his associates the dog and the horse to follow the exercises of his nature in preference to what are called its enjoyments to pine in the lap of ease and of affluence and to exult in the midst of alarms that seem to threaten his being In all which his disposition to action only keeps pace with the variety of powers with which he is furnished and the most respectable attributes of his nature magnanimity fortitude and wisdom carry a manifest reference to the difficulties with which he is destined to struggle  IF animal pleasure becomes insipid when the spirit is roused by a different object it is well known likewise that the sense of pain is prevented by any vehement affection of the soul Wounds received in a heat of passion in the hurry the ardour or consternation of battle are never felt till the ferment of the mind subsides Even torment deliberately applied and industriously prolonged are borne with firmness and with an appearance of ease when the mind is possessed with some vigorous sentiment whether of religion enthusiasm or love to mankind The continued mortifications of superstitious devotees in several ages of the Christian church the wild penances still voluntarily borne during many years by the religionists of the east the contempt in which famine and torture are held by most savage nations the chearful or obstinate patience of the soldier in the field the hardships endured by the sportsman in his pastime  show how much we may err in computing the miseries of men from the measures of trouble and of suffering they seem to incur And if there be a refinement in affirming that their happiness is not to be measured by the contrary enjoyments it is a refinement which was made by Regulus and Cincinnatus before the date of philosophy it is a refinement which every boy knows at his play and every savage confirms when he looks from his forest on the pacific city and scorns the plantation whose master he cares not to imitate  MAN it must be confessed notwithstanding all this activity of his mind is an animal in the full extent of that designation When the body sickens the mind droops and when the blood ceases to flow the soul takes its departure Charged with the care of his preservation admonished by a sense of pleasure or pain and guarded by an instinctive fear of death nature has not intrusted his safety to the mere vigilance of his understanding nor to the government of his uncertain reflections  THE distinction betwixt mind and body is followed by consequences of the greatest importance but the facts to which we now refer are not founded on any tenets whatever They are equally true whether we admit or reject the distinction in question or whether we suppose that this living agent is formed of one or is an assemblage of separate natures And the materialist by treating of man as of an engine cannot make any change in the state of his history He is a being who by a multiplicity of visible organs performs a variety of functions His joints are  bent and his muscles relax and contract in our sight the heart beats in his breast and the blood flows to every part of his frame He performs other operations which we cannot refer to any corporeal organ He perceives he recollects and forecasts he desires and he shuns he admires and contemns He enjoys his pleasures or he endures his pain All these different functions in some measure go well or ill together When the motion of the blood is languid the muscles relax the understanding is tardy and the fancy is dull when distemper assails him the physician must attend no less to what he thinks than to what he eats and examines the returns of his passion together with the strokes of his pulse  WITH all his sagacity his precautions and his instincts which are given to preserve his being he partakes in the fate of other animals and seems to be formed only that he may die Myriads perish before they reach the perfection of their kind and the individual with an option to owe the prolongation of his temporary course to resolution and conduct or to abject fear frequently chuses the latter and by a habit of timidity imbitters the life he is so intent to preserve  MAN however at times exempted from this mortifying lot seems to act without any regard to the length of his period When he thinks intensely or desires with ardour pleasures and pains from any other quarter assail him in vain Even in his dying hour the muscles acquire a tone from his spirit and the mind seems to depart in its vigour and in the midst of a struggle to obtain the recent aim of its toils Muley Moluck borne on  his litter and spent with disease still fought the battle in the midst of which he expired and the last effort he made with a finger on his lips was a signal to conceal his death the precaution perhaps of all which he had hitherto taken the most necessary to prevent a defeat  CAN no reflections aid us in acquiring this hábit of the soul so useful in carrying us through many of the ordinary scenes of life If we say that they cannot the reality of its happiness is not the less evident The Greeks and the Romans considered contempt of pleasure endurance of pain and neglect of life as eminent qualities of a man and a principal subject of discipline They trusted that the vigorous spirit would find worthy objects on which to employ its force and that the first step towards a resolute choice of such objects was to shake off the meanness of a solicitous and timorous mind  MANKIND in general have courted occasions to display their courage and frequently in search of admiration have presented a spectacle which to those who have ceased to regard fortitude on its own account becomes a subject of horror Scevola held his arm in the fire to shake the soul of Porsenna The savage inures his body to the torture that in the hour of trial he may exult over his enemy Even the Mussulman tears his flesh to win the heart of his mistress and comes in gaiety streaming with blood to shew that he deserves her esteem  Letters of the Right Hon Lady M  y W  y M  e    SOME nations carry the practice of inflicting or of sporting with pain to a degree that is either cruel or absurd others regard every prospect of bodily suffering as the greatest of evils and in the midst of their troubles imbitter every real affliction with the terrors of a feeble and dejected imagination We are not bound to answer for the follies of either nor in treating a question which relates to the nature of man make an estimate of its strength or its weakness from the habits or apprehensions peculiar to any nation or age  SECT VIII  The same subject continued  WHOEVER has compared together the different conditions and manners of men under varieties of education or fortune will be satisfied that mere situation does not constitute their happiness or misery nor a diversity of external observances imply any opposition of sentiments on the subject of morality They express their kindness and their enmity in different actions but kindness or enmity is still the principal article of consideration in human life They engage in different pursuits or acquiesce in different conditions but act from passions nearly the same There is no precise measure of accommodation required to suit their conveniency nor any degree of danger or safety under which they are peculiarly fitted to act Courage and generosity fear and envy are not peculiar to any station or order of men nor is there any condition in which some of the human race have not shewn that it is possible to employ with propriety the talents and virtues of their species  WHAT then is that mysterious thing called  Happiness  which may have place in such a variety of stations and to which circumstances in one age or nation thought necessary are in another held to be destructive or of no effect It is not the succession of mere animal pleasures which apart from the occupation or the company in which they serve to engage the mind can fill up but a few moments  in the duration of life On too frequent a repetition those pleasures turn to satiety and disgust they tear the constitution to which they are applied in excess and like the lightning of night only serve to darken the gloom through which they occasionally break Happiness is not that state of repose or that imaginary freedom from care which at a distance is so frequent an object of desire but with its approach brings a tedium or a languor more unsupportable than pain itself If the preceding observations on this subject be just it arises more from the pursuit than from the attainment of any end whatever and in every new situation to which we arrive even in the course of a prosperous life it depends more on the degree in which our minds are properly employed than it does on the circumstances in which we are destined to act on the materials which are placed in our hands or the tools with which we are furnished  IF this be confessed in respect to that class of pursuits which are distinguished by the name of  amusement  and which in the case of men who are commonly deemed the most happy occupy the greater part of human life we may apprehend that it holds much more than is commonly suspected in many cases of business where the end to be gained and not the occupation is supposed to have the principal value  THE miser himself we are told can sometimes consider the care of his wealth as a pastime and has challenged his heir to have more pleasure in spending than he in amassing his fortune With this degree of indifference to what may be  the conduct of others with this confinement of his care to what he has chosen as his own province more especially if he has conquered in himself the passions of jealousy and envy which tear the covetous mind why may not the man whose object is money be understood to lead a life of amusement and pleasure not only more entire than that of the spendthrift but even as much as the virtuoso the scholar the man of taste or any of that class of persons who have found out a method of passing their leisure without offence and to whom the acquisitions made or the works produced in their several ways perhaps are as useless as the bag to the miser or the counter to those who play from mere dissipation at any game of skill or of chance  WE are soon tired of diversions that do not approach to the nature of business that is that do not engage some passion or give an exercise proportioned to our talents and our faculties The chace and the gamingtable have each their dangers and difficulties to excite and employ the mind All games of contention animate our emulation and give a species of partyzeal The mathematician is only to be amused with intricate problems the lawyer and the casuist with cases that try their subtilty and occupy their judgement  THE desire of active engagements like every other natural appetite may be carried to excess and men may debauch in amusements as well as in the use of wine or other intoxicating liquors At first a trifling stake and the occupation of a moderate passion may have served to amuse the  gamester but when the drug becomes familiar it fails to produce its effect The play is made deep and the interest increased to awaken his attention he is carried on by degrees and in the end comes to seek for amusement and to find it only in those passions of anxiety hope and despair which are roused by the hazard into which he has thrown the whole of his fortunes  IF men can thus turn their amusements into a scene more serious and interesting than that of business itself it will be difficult to assign a reason why business and many of the occupations of human life independent of any distant consequences or future events may not be chosen as an amusement and adopted on account of the pastime they bring This is perhaps the foundation on which without the aid of reflection the contented and the chearful have rested the gaiety of their tempers It is perhaps the most solid basis of fortitude which any reflection can lay and happiness itself is secured by making a certain species of conduct our amusement and by considering life in the general estimate of its value as well as on every particular occasion as a mere scene for the exercise of the mind and the engagements of the heart  I will try and attempt every thing  says Brutus  I will never cease to recal my country from this state of servility If the event be favourable it will prove matter of joy to us all if not yet I notwithstanding shall rejoice  Why rejoice in a disappointment Why not be dejected when his country was overwhelmed Because sorrow perhaps and dejection can do no good Nay but they must be endured when they come And  whence should they come to me might the Roman say I have followed my mind and can follow it still Events may have changed the situation in which I am destined to act but can they hinder my acting the part of a man Shew me a situation in which a man can neither act nor die and I will own he is wretched  WHOEVER has the sorce of mind steadily to view human life under this aspect has only to chuse well his occupations in order to command that state of enjoyment and freedom of soul which probably constitute the peculiar felicity to which his active nature is destined  THE dispositions of men and consequently their occupations are commonly divided into two principal classes the selfish and the social The first are indulged in solitude and if they carry a reference to mankind it is that of emulation competition and enmity The second incline us to live with our fellowcreatures and to do them good they tend to unite the members of society together they terminate in a mutual participation of their cares and enjoyments and render the presence of men an occasion of joy Under this class may be enumerated the passions of the sexes the affections of parents and children general humanity or singular attachments above all that habit of the soul by which we consider ourselves as but a part of some beloved community and as but individual members of some society whose general welfare is to us the supreme object of zeal and the great rule of our conduct This affection is a principle of candour which knows no partial distinctions and is confined to no  bounds it may extend its effects beyond our personal acquaintance it may in the mind and in thought at least make us feel a relation to the universe and to the whole creation of God  Shall any one  says Antoninus  love the city of Cecrops and you not love the city of God  NO emotion of the heart is indifferent It is either an act of vivacity and joy or a feeling of sadness a transport of pleasure or a convulsion of anguish and the exercises of our different dispositions as well as their gratifications are likely to prove matter of the greatest importance to our happiness or misery  THE individual is charged with the care of his animal preservation He may exist in solitude and far removed from society perform many functions of sense imagination and reason He is even rewarded for the proper discharge of those functions and all the natural exercises which relate to himself as well as to his fellowcreatures not only occupy without distressing him but in many instances are attended with positive pleasures and fill up the hours of life with agreeable occupation  THERE is a degree however in which we suppose that the care of ourselves becomes a source of painful anxiety and cruel passions in which it degenerates into avarice vanity or pride and in which by fostering habits of jealousy and envy of fear and malice it becomes as destructive of our own enjoyments as it is hostile to the welfare of mankind This evil however is not to be charged upon any excess in the care of ourselves  but upon a mere mistake in the choice of our objects We look abroad for a happiness which is to be found only in the qualities of the heart▪ we think ourselves dependent on accidents and are therefore kept in suspence and solicitude we think ourselves dependent on the will of other men and are therefore servile and timid we think our felicity is placed in subjects for which our fellowcreatures are rivals and competitors and in pursuit of happiness we engage in those scenes of emulation envy hatred animosity and revenge that lead to the highest pitch of distress We act in short as if to preserve ourselves were to retain our weakness and perpetuate our sufferings We charge the ills of a distempered imagination and a corrupt heart to the account of our fellowcreatures to whom we refer the pangs of our disappointment or malice and while we foster our misery are surprised that the care of ourselves is attended with no better effects But he who remembers that he is by nature a rational being and a member of society that to preserve himself is to preserve his reason and to preserve the best feelings of his heart will encounter with none of these inconveniencies and in the care of himself will find subjects only of satisfaction and triumph  THE division of our appetites into benevolent and selfish has probably in some degree helped to mislead our apprehension on the subject of personal enjoyment and private good and our zeal to prove that virtue is disinterested has not greatly promoted its cause The gratification of a selfish desire it is thought brings advantage or  pleasure to ourselves that of benevolence terminates in the pleasure or advantage of others whereas in reality the gratification of every desire is a personal enjoyment and its value being proportioned to the particular quality or force of the sentiment it may happen that the same person may reap a greater advantage from the good fortune he has procured to another than from that he has obtained for himself  WHILE the gratifications of benevolence therefore are as much our own as those of any other desire whatever the mere exercises of this disposition are on many accounts to be considered as the first and the principal constituent of human happiness Every act of kindness or of care in the parent to his child every emotion of the heart in friendship or in love in public zeal or general humanity are so many acts of enjoyment and satisfaction Pity itself and compassion even grief and melancholy when grafted on some tender affection partake of the nature of the stock and if they are not positive pleasures are at least pains of a peculiar nature which we do not even wish to exchange but for a very real enjoyment obtained in relieving our object Even extremes in this class of our dispositions as they are the reverse of hatred envy and malice so they are never attended with those excruciating anxieties jealousies and fears which tear the interested mind or if in reality any ill passion arise from a pretended attachment to our fellowcreatures that attachment may be safely condemned as not genuine If we be distrustful or jealous our pretended affection is probably no more than a desire  of attention and personal consideration a motive which frequently inclines us to be connected with our fellowcreatures but to which we are as frequently willing to sacrifice their happiness We consider them as the tools of our vanity pleasure or interest not as the parties on whom we may bestow the effects of our goodwill and our love  A MIND devoted to this class of its affections being occupied with an object that may engage it habitually is not reduced to court the amusements or pleasures with which persons of an ill temper are obliged to repair their disgusts and temperance becomes an easy task when gratifications of sense are supplanted by those of the heart Courage too is most easily assumed or is rather inseparable from that ardour of the mind in society friendship or in public action which makes us forget subjects of personal anxiety or fear and attend chiefly to the object of our zeal or affection not to the trifling inconveniencies dangers or hardships which we ourselves may encounter in striving to maintain it  IT should seem therefore to be the happiness of man to make his social dispositions the ruling spring of his occupations to state himself as the member of a community for whose general good his heart may glow with an ardent zeal to the suppression of those personal cares which are the foundation of painful anxieties fear jealousy and envy or as Mr Pope expresses the same sentiment  Man like the generous vine supported lives  The strength he gains is from th'embrace he gives  The same maxim will apply throughout every part of nature  To love is to enjoy pleasure To bate is to be in pain    If this be the good of the individual it is likewise that of mankind and virtue no longer imposes a task by which we are obliged to bestow upon others that good from which we ourselves refrain but supposes in the highest degree as possessed by ourselves that state of felicity which we are required to promote in the world  WE commonly apprehend that it is our duty to do kindnesses and our happiness to receive them but if in reality courage and a heart devoted to the good of mankind are the constituents of human felicity the kindness which is done infers a happiness in the person from whom it proceeds not in him on whom it is bestowed and the greatest good which men possessed of fortitude and generosity can procure to their fellowcreatures is a participation of this happy character  You will confer the greatest benefit on your city  says Epictetus  not by raising the roofs but by exalting the souls of your fellowcitizens for it is better that great souls should live in small habitations than that abject slaves should burrow in great houses  Mrs Carter's translation of the works of Epictetus    TO the benevolent the satisfaction of others is a ground of enjoyment and existence itself in a world that is governed by the wisdom of God is a blessing The mind freed from cares that lead to pusillanimity and meanness becomes calm active fearless and bold capable of every enterprise and vigorous in the exercise of every talent by which the nature of man is adorned On this foundation was raised the admirable character which during a certain period of their story distinguished the celebrated nations of antiquity and rendered familiar and ordinary in their manners examples of magnanimity which under governments less favourable to the public affections rarely occur or which without being much practised or even understood are made subjects of admiration and swelling panegyric  Thus  says Xenophon  died Thrasybulus who indeed appears to have been a good man  What valuable praise and how significant to those who know the story of this admirable person The members of those illustrious states from the habit of considering themselves as part of a community or at least as deeply involved with some order of men in the state were regardless of personal considerations they had a perpetual view to objects which excite a great ardour in the soul which led them to act perpetually in the view of their fellowcitizens and to practise those arts of deliberation elocution policy and war on which the fortunes of nations or of men in their collective body depend To the force of mind collected in this career and to the improvements of wit which were made in pursuing it these nations owed not only their magnanimity and the superiority of  their political and military conduct but even the arts of poetry and literature which among them were only the inferior appendages of a genius otherwise excited cultivated and refined  TO the ancient Greek or the Roman the individual was nothing and the public every thing To the modern in too many nations of Europe the individual is every thing and the public nothing The state is merely a combination of departments in which consideration wealth eminence or power are offered as the reward of service It was the nature of modern government even in its first institution to bestow on every individual a fixed station and dignity which he was to maintain for himself Our ancestors in rude ages during the recess of wars from abroad fought for their personal claims at home and by their competitions and the balance of their powers maintained a kind of political freedom in the state while private parties were subject to continual wrongs and oppressions Their posterity in times more polished have repressed the civil disorders in which the activity of earlier ages chiefly consisted but they employ the calm they have gained not in fostering a zeal for those laws and that constitution of government to which they owe their protection but in practising apart and each for himself the several arts of personal advancement or profit which their political establishments may enable them to pursue with success Commerce which may be supposed to comprehend every lucatrive art is accordingly considered as the great object of nations and the principal study of mankind  SO much are we accustomed to consider personal fortune as the sole object of care that even under popular establishments and in states where different orders of men are summoned to partake in the government of their country and where the liberties they enjoy cannot be long preserved without vigilance and activity on the part of the subject still they who in the vulgar phrase have not their fortunes to make are supposed to be at a loss for occupation and betake themselves to solitary pastimes or cultivate what they are pleased to call a taste for gardening building drawing or music With this aid they endeavour to fill up the blanks of a listless life and avoid the necessity of curing their languors by any positive service to their country or to mankind  THE weak or the malicious are well employed in any thing that is innocent and are fortunate in finding any occupation which prevents the effects of a temper that would prey upon themselves or upon their fellowcreatures But they who are blessed with a happy disposition with capacity and vigour incur a real debauchery by having any amusement that occupies an improper share of their time and are really cheated of their happiness in being made to believe that any occupation or pastime is better fitted to amuse themselves than that which at the same time produces some real good to their fellowcreatures  THIS sort of entertainment indeed cannot be the choice of the mercenary the envious or  the malignant Its value is known only to persons of an opposite temper and to their experience alone we appeal Guided by mere disposition and without the aid of reflection in business in friendship and in public life they often acquit themselves well and borne with satisfaction on the tide of their emotions and sentiments enjoy the present hour without recollection of the past or hopes of the future It is in speculation not in practice they are made to discover that virtue is a task of severity and selfdenial  SECT IX  Of National Felicity  MAN is by nature the member of a community and when considered in this capacity the individual appears to be no longer made for himself He must forego his happiness and his freedom where these interfere with the good of society He is only part of a whole and the praise we think due to his virtue is but a branch of that more general commendation we bestow on the member of a body on the part of a fabric or engine for being well fitted to occupy its place and to produce its effect  IF this follow from the relation of a part to its whole and if the public good be the principal object with individuals it is likewise true that the happiness of individuals is the great end of civil society for in what sense can a public enjoy any good if its members considered apart be unhappy  THE interests of society however and of its members are easily reconciled If the individual owe every degree of consideration to the public he receives in paying that very consideration the greatest happiness of which his nature is capable and the greatest blessing that the public can bestow on its members is to keep them attached to itself That is the most happy state which is most beloved by its subjects and they are the most happy men whose hearts are engaged to a  community in which they find every object of generosity and zeal and a scope to the exercise of every talent and of every virtuous disposition  AFTER we have thus found general maxims the greater part of our trouble remains their just application to particular cases Nations are different in respect to their extent numbers of people and wealth in respect to the arts they practise and the accommodations they have procured These circumstances may not only affect the manners of men they even in our esteem come into competition with the article of manners itself are supposed to constitute a national felicity independent of virtue and give a title upon which we indulge our own vanity and that of other nations as we do that of private men on the score of their fortunes and honours  BUT if this way of measuring happiness when applied to private men be ruinous and false it is so no less when applied to nations Wealth commerce extent of territory and the knowledge of arts are when properly employed the means of preservation and the foundations of power If they fail in part the nation is weakened if they were entirely withheld the race would perish their tendency is to maintain numbers of men but not to constitute happiness They will accordingly maintain the wretched as well as the happy They answer one purpose but are not therefore sufficient for all and are of little significance when only employed to maintain a timid dejected and servile people  GREAT and powerful states are able to overcome and subdue the weak polished and commercial nations have more wealth and practise a greater variety of arts than the rude but the happiness of men in all cases alike consists in the blessings of a candid an active and strenuous mind And if we consider the state of society merely as that into which mankind are led by their propensities as a state to be valued from its effect in preserving the species in ripening their talents and exciting their virtues we need not enlarge our communities in order to enjoy these advantages We frequently obtain them in the most remarkable degree where nations remain independent and are of a small extent  TO increase the numbers of mankind may be admitted as a great and important object but to extend the limits of any particular state is not perhaps the way to obtain it while we desire that our fellowcreatures should multiply it does not follow that the whole should if possible be united under one head We are apt to admire the empire of the Romans as a model of national greatness and splendour but the greatness we admire in this case was ruinous to the virtue and the happiness of mankind it was found to be inconsistent with all the advantages which that conquering people had formerly enjoyed in the articles of government and manners  THE emulation of nations proceeds from their division A cluster of states like a company of men find the exercise of their reason and the test of their virtues in the affairs they transact upon  a foot of equality and of separate interest The measures taken for safety including great part of the national policy are relative in every state to what is apprehended from abroad Athens was necessary to Sparta in the exercise of her virtue as steel is to flint in the production of fire and if the cities of Greece had been united under one head we should never have heard of Epaminondas or Thrasybulus of Lycurgus or Solon  WHEN we reason in behalf of our species therefore although we may lament the abuses which sometimes arise from independence and opposition of interest yet whilst any degrees of virtue remain with mankind we cannot wish to croud under one establishment numbers of men who may serve to constitute several or to commit affairs to the conduct of one senate one legislative or executive power which upon a distinct and separate footing might furnish an exercise of ability and a theatre of glory to many  THIS may be a subject upon which no determinate rule can be given but the admiration of boundless dominion is a ruinous error and in no instance perhaps is the real interest of mankind more entirely mistaken  THE measure of enlargement to be wished for any particular state is often to be taken from the condition of its neighbours Where a number of states are contiguous they should be near an equality in order that they may be mutually objects of respect and consideration and in order that they may possess that independence in which the political life of a nation consists  WHEN the kingdoms of Spain were united when the great fiefs in France were annexed to the crown it was no longer expedient for the nations of Great Britain to continue disjoined  THE small republics of Greece indeed by their subdivisions and the balance of their power found almost in every village the object of nations Every little district was a nursery of excellent men and what is now the wretched corner of a great empire was the field on which mankind have reaped their principal honours But in modern Europe republics of a similar extent are like shrubs under the shade of a taller wood choked by the neighbourhood of more powerful states In their case a certain disproportion of force frustrates in a great measure the advantage of separation They are like the trader in Poland who is the more despicable and the less secure that he is neither master nor slave  INDEPENDENT communities in the mean time however weak are averse to a coalition not only where it comes with an air of imposition or unequal treaty but even where it implies no more than the admission of new members to an equal share of consideration with the old The citizen has no interest in the annexation of kingdoms he must find his importance diminished as the state is enlarged but ambitious men under the enlargement of territory find a more plentiful harvest of power and of wealth while government itself is an easier task Hence the ruinous progress of empire and hence free nations under the shew of acquiring dominion suffer themselves  in the end to be yoked with the slaves they had conquered  OUR desire to augment the force of a nation is the only pretext for enlarging its territory but this measure when pursued to extremes seldom fails to frustrate itself  NOTWITHSTANDING the advantage of numbers and superior resources in war the strength of a nation is derived from the character not from the wealth nor from the multitude of its people If the treasure of a state can hire numbers of men erect ramparts and furnish the implements of war the possessions of the fearful are easily seized a timorous multitude falls into rout of itself ramparts may be scaled where they are not desended by valour and arms are of consequence only in the hands of the brave The band to which Agesilaus pointed as the wall of his city made a defence for their country more permanent and more effectual than the rock and the cement with which other cities were fortified  WE should owe little to that statesman who were to contrive a defence that might supersede the external uses of virtue It is wisely ordered for man as a rational being that the employment of reason is necessary to his preservation it is fortunate for him in the pursuit of distinction that his personal consideration depends on his character and it is fortunate for nations that in order to be powerful and safe they must strive to maintain the courage and cultivate the virtues of their people By the use of such means they at once gain their external ends and are happy  PEACE and unanimity are commonly considered as the principal foundations of public felicity yet the rivalship of separate communities and the agitations of a free people are the principles of political life and the school of men How shall we reconcile these jarring and opposite tenets It is perhaps not necessary to reconcile them The pacific may do what they can to allay the animosities and to reconcile the opinions of men and it will be happy if they can succeed in repressing their crimes and in calming the worst of their passions Nothing in the mean time but corruption or slavery can suppress the debates that subsist among men of integrity who bear an equal part in the administration of state  A PERFECT agreement in matters of opinion is not to be obtained in the most select company and if it were what would become of society  The Spartan legislator  says Plutarch  appears to have sown the seeds of variance and dissension among his countrymen he meant that good citizens should be led to dispute he considered emulation as the brand by which their virtues were kindled and seemed to apprehend that a complaisance by which men submit their opinions without examination is a principal source of corruption  FORMS of government are supposed to decide the happiness or misery of mankind But forms of government must be varied in order to suit the extent the way of subsistence the character and the manners of different nations In some cases the multitude may be suffered to govern  themselves in others they must be severely restrained The inhabitants of a village in some primitive age may have been safely intrusted to the conduct of reason and to the suggestion of their innocent views but the tenants of Newgate can scarcely be trusted with chains locked to their bodies and bars of iron fixed to their legs How is it possible therefore to find any single form of government that would suit mankind in every condition  WE proceed however in the following section to point out the distinctions and to explain the language which occurs in this place on the head of different models for subordination and government  SECT X  The same subject continued  IT is a common observation That mankind were originally equal They have indeed by nature equal rights to their preservation and to the use of their talents but they are fitted for different stations and when they are classed by a rule taken from this circumstance they suffer no injustice on the side of their natural rights It is obvious that some mode of subordination is as necessary to men as society itself and this not only to attain the ends of government but to comply with an order established by nature  PRIOR to any political institution whatever men are qualified by a great diversity of talents by a different tone of the soul and ardour of the passions to act a variety of parts Bring them together each will find his place They censure or applaud in a body they consult and deliberate in more select parties they take or give an ascendant as individuals and numbers are by this means fitted to act in company and to preserve their communities before any formal distribution of office is made  WE are formed to act in this manner and if we have any doubts with relation to the rights of government in general we owe our perplexity more to the subtilties of the speculative than to any uncertainty in the feelings of the heart Involved  in the resolutions of our company we move with the croud before we have determined the rule by which its will is collected We follow a leader before we have settled the ground of his pretensions or adjusted the form of his election and it is not till after mankind have committed many errors in the capacities of magistrate and subject that they think of making government itself a subject of rules  IF therefore in considering the variety of forms under which societies subsist the casuist is pleased to inquire What title one man or any number of men have to controul his actions he may be answered None at all provided that his actions have no effect to the prejudice of his fellowcreatures but if they have the rights of defence and the obligation to repress the commission of wrongs belong to collective bodies as well as to individuals Many rude nations having no formal tribunals for the judgement of crimes assemble when alarmed by any flagrant offence and take their measures with the criminal as they would with an enemy  BUT will this consideration which confirms the title to sovereignty where it is exercised by the society in its collective capacity or by those to whom the powers of the whole are committed likewise support the claim to dominion whereever it is casually lodged or even where it is only maintained by force  THIS question may be sufficiently answered by observing that a right to do justice and to do good is competent to every individual or order of men and that the exercise of this right has no  limits but in the defect of power But a right to do wrong and commit injustice is an abuse of language and a contradiction in terms It is no more competent to the collective body of a people than it is to any single usurper When we admit such a prerogative in the case of any sovereign we can only mean to express the extent of his power and the force with which he is enabled to execute his pleasure Such a prerogative is assumed by the leader of banditti at the head of his gang or by a despotic prince at the head of his troops When the sword is presented by either the traveller or the inhabitant may submit from a sense of necessity or fear but he lies under no obligation from a motive of duty or justice  THE multiplicity of forms in the mean time which different societies offer to our view is almost infinite The classes into which they distribute their members the manner in which they establish the legislative and executive powers the imperceptible circumstances by which they are led to have different customs and to confer on their governors unequal measures of power and authority give rise to perpetual distinctions between constitutions the most nearly resembling one another and give to human affairs a variety in detail which in its full extent no understanding can comprehend and no memory retain  IN order to have a general and comprehensive knowledge of the whole we must be determined on this as on every other subject to overlook many particulars and singularities distinguishing different governments to fix our attention on certain points in which many agree and thereby establish  a few general heads under which the subject may be distinctly considered When we have marked the characteristics which form the general points of coincidence when we have pursued them to their consequences in the several modes of legislation execution and judicature in the establishments which relate to police commerce religion or domestic life we have made an acquisition of knowledge which though it does not supersede the necessity of experience may serve to direct our inquiries and in the midst of affairs to give an order and a method for the arrangement of particulars that occur to our observation  WHEN I recollect what the President Montesquieu has written I am at a loss to tell why I should treat of human affairs but I too am instigated by my reflections and my sentiments and I may utter them more to the comprehension of ordinary capacities because I am more on the level of ordinary men If it be necessary to pave the way for what follows on the general history of nations by giving some account of the heads under which various forms of government may be conveniently ranged the reader should perhaps be referred to what has been already delivered on the subject by this profound politician and amiable moralist In his writings will be found not only the original of what I am now for the fake of order to copy from him but likewise probably the source of many observations which in different places I may under the belief of invention have repeated without quoting their author  THE ancient philosophers treated of government commonly under three heads the Demoratic  the Aristocratic and the Despotic Their attention was chiefly occupied with the varieties of republican government and they paid little regard to a very important distinction which Mr Montesquieu has made between despotism and monarchy He too has considered government as reducible to three general forms and  to understand the nature of each  he observes  it is sufficient to recal ideas which are familiar with men of the least reflection who admit three definitions or rather three facts That a republic is a state in which the people in a collective body or a part of the people possess the sovereign power That monarchy is that in which one man governs according to fixed and determinate laws and a despotism is that in which one man without law or rule of administration by the mere impulse of will or caprice decides and carries every thing before him  REPUBLICS admit of a very material distinction which is pointed out in the general definition that between democracy and aristocracy In the first supreme power remains in the hands of the collective body Every office of magistracy at the nomination of this sovereign is open to every citizen who in the discharge of his duty becomes the minister of the people and accountable to them for every object of his trust  IN the second the sovereignty is lodged in a particular class or order of men who being once named continue for life or by the hereditary distinctions of birth and fortune are advanced to a station of permanent superiority From this order and by their nomination all the offices of magistracy are filled and in the different assemblies  which they constitute whatever relates to the legislation the execution or jurisdiction is finally determined  MR Montesquieu has pointed out the sentiments or maxims from which men must be supposed to act under these different governments  IN democracy they must love equality they must respect the rights of their fellowcitizens they must unite by the common ties of affection to the state In forming personal pretensions they must be satisfied with that degree of consideration they can procure by their abilities fairly measured with those of an opponent they must labour for the public without hope of profit they must reject every attempt to create a personal dependence Candour force and elevation of mind in short are the props of democracy and virtue is the principle of conduct required to its preservation  HOW beautiful a preeminence on the side of popular government and how ardently should mankind wish for the form if it tended to establish the principle or were in every instance a sure indication of its presence  BUT perhaps we must have possessed the principle in order with any hopes of advantage to receive the form and where the first is entirely extinguished the other may be fraught with evil if any additional evil deserves to be shunned where men are already unhappy  AT Constantinople or Algiers it is a miserable spectacle when men pretend to act on a foot of equality they only mean to shake off the restraints  of government and to seize as much as they can of that spoil which in ordinary times is ingrossed by the master they serve  IT is one advantage of democracy that the principal ground of distinction being personal qualities men are classed according to their abilities and to the merit of their actions Though all have equal pretensions to power yet the state is actually governed by a few The majority of the people even in their capacity of sovereign only pretend to employ their senses to feel when pressed by national inconveniencies or threatened by public dangers and with the ardour which is apt to arise in crouded assemblies to urge the pursuits in which they are engaged or to repel the attacks with which they are menaced  THE most perfect equality of rights can never exclude the ascendant of superior minds nor the assemblies of a collective body govern without the direction of select councils On this account popular government may be confounded with aristocracy But this alone does not constitute the character of aristocratical government Here the members of the state are divided at least into two classes of which one is destined to command the other to obey No merits or defects can raise or sink a person from one class to the other The only effect of personal character is to procure the individual a suitable degree of consideration with his own order not to vary his rank In one situation he is taught to assume in another to yield the preeminence He occupies the station of patron or client and is either the sovereign or the subject of his country The whole citizens may  unite in executing the plans of state but never in deliberating on its measures or enacting its laws What belongs to the whole people under democracy is here confined to a part Members of the superior order are among themselves possibly classed according to their abilities but retain a perpetual ascendant over those of inferior station They are at once the servants and the masters of the state and pay with their personal attendance and their blood for the civil or military honours they enjoy  TO maintain for himself and to admit in his fellowcitizen a perfect equality of privilege and station is no longer the leading maxim of the member of such a community The rights of men are modified by their condition One order claims more than it is willing to yield the other must be ready to yield what it does not assume to itself and it is with good reason that Mr Montesquieu gives to the principle of such governments the name of  moderation  not of  virtue  THE elevation of one class is a moderated arrogance the submission of the other a limited deference The first must be careful by concealing the invidious part of their distinction to palliate what is grievous in the public arrangement and by their education their cultivated manners and improved talents to appear qualified for the stations they occupy The other must be taught to yield from respect and personal attachment what could not otherwise be extorted by force When this moderation fails on either side the constitution totters A populace enraged to mutiny may claim the right of equality to which they are admitted  in democratical states or a nobility bent on dominion may chuse among themselves or find already pointed out to them a sovereign who by advantages of sortune popularity or abilities is ready to seize for his own family that envied power which has already carried his order beyond the limits of moderation and infected particular men with a boundless ambition  MONARCHIES have accordingly been found with the recent marks of aristocracy There however the monarch is only the first among the nobles he must be satisfied with a limited power his subjects are ranged into classes he finds on every quarter a pretence to privilege that circumscribes his authority and he finds a force sufficient to confine his administration within certain bounds of equity and determinate laws  UNDER such governments however the love of equality is preposterous and moderation itself is unnecessary The object of every rank is precedency and every order may display its advantages to their full extent The sovereign himself owes great part of his authority to the sounding titles and the dazzling equipage which he exhibits in public The subordinate ranks lay claim to importance by a like exhibition and for that purpose carry in every instant the ensigns of their birth or the ornaments of their fortune What else could mark out to the individual the relation in which he stands to his fellowsubjects or distinguish the numberless ranks that fill up the interval between the state of the sovereign and that of the peasant Or what else could in states of a great extent preserve any appearance of order among members disunited by ambition and interest and destined  to form a community without the sense of any common concern  MONARCHIES are generally found where the state is enlarged in population and in territory beyond the numbers and dimensions that are consistent with republican government Together with these circumstances great inequalities arise in the distribution of property and the desire of preeminence becomes the predominant passion Every rank would exercise its prerogative and the sovereign is perpetually tempted to enlarge his own if subjects who despair of precedence plead for equality he is willing to favour their claims and to aid them in procuring what must weaken a force with which he himself is on many occasions obliged to contend In the event of such a policy many invidious distinctions and grievances peculiar to monarchical government may in appearance be removed but the state of equality to which the subjects approach is that of slaves equally dependent on the will of a master not that of freemen in a condition to maintain their own  THE principle of monarchy according to Montesquieu is honour Men may possess good qualities elevation of mind and fortitude but the sense of equality that will bear no incroachment on the personal rights of the meanest citizen the indignant spirit that will not court a protection nor accept as a favour what is due as a right the public affection which is founded on the neglect of personal considerations are neither consistent with the preservation of the constitution nor agreeable to the habits acquired in any station assigned to its members  EVERY condition is possessed of peculiar dignity and points out a propriety of conduct which men of station are obliged to maintain In the commerce of superiors and inferiors it is the object of ambition and of vanity to refine on the advantages of rank while to facilitate the intercourse of polite society it is the aim of good breeding to disguise or reject them  THOUGH the objects of consideration are rather the dignities of station than personal qualities though friendship cannot be formed by mere inclination nor alliances by the mere choice of the heart yet men so united and even without changing their order are highly susceptible of moral excellence or liable to many different degrees of corruption They may act a vigorous part as members of the state an amiable one in the commerce of private society or they may yield up their dignity as citizens even while they raise their arrogance and presumption as private parties  IN monarchy all orders of men derive their honours from the crown but they continue to hold them as a right and they exercise a subordinate power in the state founded on the permanent rank they enjoy and on the attachment of those whom they are appointed to lead and protect Though they do not force themselves into national councils and public assemblies and though the name of senate is unknown yet the sentiments they adopt must have weight with the sovereign and every individual in his separate capacity in some measure deliberates for his country In whatever does not derogate from his rank he has an arm ready to serve the community in whatever alarms his sense  of honour he has aversions and dislikes which amount to a negative on the will of his prince  INTANGLED together by the reciprocal ties of dependence and protection though not combined by the sense of a common interest the subjects of monarchy like those of republics find themselves occupied as the members of an active society and engaged to treat with their fellowcreatures on a liberal footing If those principles of honour which save the individual from servility in his own person or from becoming an engine of oppression in the hands of another should fail if they should give way to the maxims of commerce to the refinements of a supposed philosophy or to the misplaced ardours of a republican spirit if they are betrayed by the cowardice of subjects or subdued by the ambition of princes what must become of the nations of Europe  DESPOTISM is monarchy corrupted in which a court and a prince in appearance remain but in which every subordinate rank is destroyed in which the subject is told that he has no rights that he cannot possess any property nor fill any station independent of the momentary will of his prince These doctrines are founded on the maxims of conquest they must be inculcated with the whip and the sword and are best received under the terror of chains and imprisonment Fear therefore is the principle which qualifies the subject to occupy his station and the sovereign who holds out the ensigns of terror so freely to others has abundant reason to give this passion a principal place with himself That tenure which he has devised for the rights of others is soon applied to his own and from his eager desire to secure or to extend  his power he finds it become like the fortunes of his people a creature of mere imagination and unsettled caprice  WHILST we thus with so much accuracy can assign the ideal limits that may distinguish constitutions of government we find them in reality both in respect to the principle and the form variously blended together In what society are not men classed by external distinctions as well as personal qualities In what state are they not actuated by a variety of principles justice honour moderation and fear It is the purpose of science not to disguise this confusion in its object but in the multiplicity and combination of particulars to find the principal points which deserve our attention and which being well understood save us from the embarrassment which the varieties of singular cases might otherwise create In the same degree in which governments require men to act from principles of virtue of honour or of fear they are more or less fully comprised under the heads of republic monarchy or despotism and the general theory is more or less applicable to their particular case  FORMS of government in fact mutually approach or recede by many and often insensible gradations Democracy by admitting certain inequalities of rank approaches to aristocracy In popular as well as aristocratical governments particular men by their personal authority and sometimes by the credit of their family have maintained a species of monarchical power The monarch is limited in different degrees even the despotic prince is only that monarch whose subjects  claim the fewest privileges or who is himself best prepared to subdue them by force All these varieties are but steps in the history of mankind and mark the fleeting and transient situations through which they have passed while supported by virtue or depressed by vice  PERFECT democracy and despotism appear to be the opposite extremes to which constitutions of government are sometimes carried Under the first a perfect virtue is required under the second a total corruption is supposed yet in point of mere form there being nothing fixed in the ranks and distinctions of men beyond the casual and temporary possession of power societies easily pass from a condition in which every individual has an equal title to reign into one in which they are equally destined to serve The same qualities in both courage popularity address and military conduct raise the ambitious to eminence With these qualities the citizen or the slave easily passes from the ranks to the command of an army from an obscure to an illustrious station In either a single person may rule with unlimited sway and in both the populace may break down every barrier of order and restraint of law  IF we suppose that the equality established among the subjects of a despotic state has inspired its members with confidence intrepidity and the love of justice the despotic prince having ceased to be an object of fear must sink among the croud If on the contrary the personal equality which is enjoyed by the members of a democratical state should be valued merely as an equal pretension  to the objects of avarice and ambition the monarch may start up anew and be supported by those who mean to share in his profits When the covetous and mercenary assemble in parties it is of no consequence under what leader they inlist whether Caesar or Pompey the hopes of rapine or power are the only motives from which they become attached to either  IN the disorder of corrupted societies the scene has been frequently changed from democracy to despotism and from the last too in its turn to the first From amidst the democracy of corrupt men and from a scene of lawless consusion the tyrant ascends a throne with arms reeking in blood But his abuses or his weaknesses in the station which he has gained in their turn awaken and give way to the spirit of mutiny and revenge The cries of murder and desolation which in the ordinary course of military government terrified the subject in his private retreat are carried through the vaults and made to pierce the grates and iron doors of the seraglio Democracy seems to revive in a scene of wild disorder and tumult but both the extremes are but the transient fits of paroxysm or languor in a distempered state  IF men be any where arrived at this measure of depravity there appears no immediate hope of redress Neither the ascendency of the multitude nor that of the tyrant will secure the administration of justice neither the licence of mere tumult nor the calm of dejection and servitude will teach the citizen that he was born for candour and affection to his fellowcreatures And if the  speculative would find that habitual state of war which they are sometimes pleased to honour with the name of  the state of nature  they will find it in the contest that subsists between the despotical prince and his subjects not in the first approaches of a rude and simple tribe to the condition and the domestic arrangement of nations  PART SECOND  Of the History of Rude Nations  SECTION I  Of the Informations on this subject which are derived from Antiquity  THE history of mankind is confined within a limited period and from every quarter brings an intimation that human affairs have had a beginning Nations distinguished by the possession of arts and the felicity of their political establishments have been derived from a feeble original and still preserve in their story the indications of a slow and gradual progress by which this distinction was gained The antiquities of every people however diversified and however disguised contain the same information on this point  IN sacred history we find the parents of the species as yet a single pair sent forth to inherit the earth and to force a subsistence for themselves amidst the briers and thorns which were made to  abound on its surface Their race which was again reduced to a few had to struggle with the dangers that await a weak and infant species and after many ages elapsed the most respectable nations took their rise from one or a few families that had pastured their flocks in the desert  THE Grecians derive their own origin from unsettled tribes whose frequent migrations are a proof of the rude and infant state of their communities and whose warlike exploits so much celebrated in story only exhibit the struggles with which they disputed for the possession of a country they afterwards by their talent for fable by their arts and their policy rendered so famous in the history of mankind  ITALY must have been divided into many rude and feeble cantons when a band of robbers as we are taught to consider them found a secure settlement on the banks of the Tiber and when a people yet composed only of one sex sustained the character of a nation Rome for many ages saw from her walls on every side the territory of her enemies and found as little to check or to sti  the weakness of her infant power as she did afterwards to restrain the progress of her extended empire Like a Tartar or a Scythian horde which had pitched on a settlement this nascent community was equal if not superior to every tribe in its neighbourhood and the oak which has covered the field with its shade was once a feeble plant in the nursery and not to be distinguished from the weeds by which its early growth was restrained  THE Gauls and the Germans are come to our knowledge with the marks of a similar condition and the inhabitants of Britain at the time of the first Roman invasions resembled in many things the present natives of North America they were ignorant of agriculture they painted their bodies and used for cloathing the skins of beasts  SUCH therefore appears to have been the commencement of history with all nations and in such circumstances are we to look for the original character of mankind The inquiry refers to a distant period and every conclusion should build on the facts which are preserved for our use Our method notwithstanding too frequently is to rest the whole on conjecture to impute every advantage of our nature to those arts which we ourselves possess and to imagine that a mere negation of all our virtues is a sufficient description of man in his original state We are ourselves the supposed standards of politeness and civilization and where our own features do not appear we apprehend that there is nothing which deserves to be known But it is probable that here as in many other cases we are ill qualified from our supposed knowledge of causes to prognosticate effects or to determine what must have been the properties and operations even of our own nature in the absence of those circumstances in which we have seen it engaged Who would from mere conjecture suppose that the naked savage would be a coxcomb and a gamester that he would be proud and vain without the distinctions of title and fortune and that his principal care would be to adorn his person and to find an amusement  Even if it could be supposed that he would thus share in our vices and in the midst of his forest vie with the follies which are practised in the town yet no one would be so bold as to affirm that he would likewise in any instance excel us in talents and virtues that he would have a penetration a force of imagination and elocution an ardour of mind an affection and courage which the arts the discipline and the policy of few nations would be able to improve Yet these particulars are a part in the description which is delivered by those who have had opportunities of seeing mankind in their rudest condition and beyond the reach of such testimony we can neither safely take nor pretend to give information on the subject  IF conjectures and opinions formed at a distance have not sufficient authority in the history of mankind the domestic antiquities of every nation must for this very reason be received with caution They are for most part the mere conjectures or the fictions of subsequent ages and even where at first they contained some resemblance of truth they still vary with the imagination of those by whom they are transmitted and in every generation receive a different form They are made to bear the stamp of the times through which they have passed in the form of tradition not of the ages to which their pretended descriptions relate The information they bring is not like the light reflected from a mirrour which delineates the object from which it originally came but like rays that come broken and dispersed from an opaque or unpolished surface only give  the colours and features of the body from which they were last reflected  WHEN traditionary fables are rehearsed by the vulgar they bear the marks of a national character and though mixed with absurdities often raise the imagination and move the heart when made the materials of poetry and adorned by the skill and the eloquence of an ardent and superior mind they instruct the understanding as well as engage the passions It is only in the management of mere antiquaries or stript of the ornaments which the laws of history forbid them to wear that they become even unfit to amuse the fancy or to serve any purpose whatever  IT were absurd to quote the fable of the Iliad or Odyssey the legends of Hercules Theseus or OEdipus as authorities in matter of fact relating to the history of mankind but they may with great justice be cited to ascertain what were the conceptions and sentiments of the age in which they were composed or to characterise the genius of that people with whose imaginations they were blended and by whom they were fondly rehearsed and admired  IN this manner fiction may be admitted to vouch for the genius of nations while history has nothing to offer that is intitled to credit The Greek fable accordingly conveying a character of its authors throws light on an age of which no other record remains The superiority of this people is indeed in no circumstance more evident than in the strain of their fictions and in the story of those fabulous heroes poets and sages whose tales being invented or embellished by an imagination  already filled with the subject for which the hero was celebrated served to inflame that ardent enthusiasm with which this people afterwards proceeded in the pursuit of every national object  IT was no doubt of great advantage to those nations that their system of fable was original and being already received in popular traditions served to diffuse those improvements of reason imagination and sentiment which were afterwards by men of the finest talents made on the fable itself or conveyed in its moral The passions of the poet pervaded the minds of the people and the conceptions of men of genius being communicated to the vulgar became the incentives of a national spirit  A MYTHOLOGY borrowed from abroad a literature founded on references to a strange country and fraught with foreign allusions are much more confined in their use they speak to the learned alone and though intended to inform the understanding and to mend the heart may by being confined to a few have an opposite effect they may foster conceit on the ruins of common sense and render what was at least innocently sung by the Athenian mariner at his oar or rehearsed by the shepherd in attending his flock an occasion of vice and the foundation of pedantry and scholastic pride  OUR very learning perhaps where its influence extends serves in some measure to depress our national spirit Our literature being de+rived from nations of a different race who flou+rished at a time when our ancestors were in a stat  of barbarity and consequently when they were despised by those who had attained to the literary arts has given rise to a humbling opinion that we ourselves are the offspring of mean and contemptible nations with whom the human imagination and sentiment had no effect till the genius was in a manner inspired by examples and directed by lessons that were brought from abroad The Romans from whom our accounts are chiefly derived have admitted in the rudeness of their own ancestors a system of virtues which all simple nations perhaps equally possess a contempt of riches love of their country patience of hardship danger and fatigue They have notwithstanding vilified our ancestors for having perhaps only resembled their own at least in the defect of their arts and in the neglect of conveniencies which those arts are employed to procure  IT is from the Greek and the Roman historians however that we have not only the most authentic and instructive but even the most engaging representations of the tribes from whom we descend Those sublime and intelligent writers understood human nature and could collect its features and exhibit its characters in every situation They were ill succeeded in this task by the early historians of modern Europe who generally bred to the profession of monks and confined to the monastic life applied themselves to record what they were pleased to denominate facts while they suffered the productions of genius to perish and were unable either by the matter they selected or the style of their compositions to give any representation of the active spirit of mankind in any condition With them a narration was supposed  to constitute history whilst it did not convey any knowledge of men and history itself was allowed to be complete while amidst the events and the succession of princes that are recorded in the order of time we are left to look in vain for those characteristics of the understanding and the heart which alone in every human transaction render the story either engaging or useful  WE therefore willingly quit the history of our early ancestors where Caesar and Tacitus have dropped them and perhaps till we come within the reach of what is connected with present affairs and makes a part in the system on which we now proceed have little reason to expect any subject to interest or inform the mind We have no reason however from hence to conclude that the matter itself was more barren or the scene of human affairs less interesting in modern Europe than it has been on every stage where mankind were engaged to exhibit the movements of the heart the efforts of generosity magnanimity and courage  THE trial of what those ages contained is not even fairly made when men of genius and distinguished abilities with the accomplishments of a learned and a polished age collect the materials they have found and with the greatest success connect the story of illiterate ages with transactions of a later date it is difficult even for them under the names which are applied in a new state of society to convey a just apprehension of what mankind were in situations so different and in times so remote from their own  IN deriving from historians of this character the instruction which their writings are fit to bestow we are frequently to forget the general terms that are employed in order to collect the real manners of an age from the minute circumstances that are occasionally presented The titles of  Royal  and  Noble  were applicable to the families of Tarquin Collatinus and Cincinnatus but Lucretia was employed in domestic industry with her maids and Cincinnatus followed the plough The dignities and even the offices of civil society were known many ages ago in Europe by their present appellations but we find in the history of England that a king and his court being assembled to solemnize a festival an outlaw who had subsisted by robbery came to share in the feast The king himself arose to force this unworthy guest from the company a scuffle ensued between them and the king was killed  Hume's History ch p  A chancellor and prime minister whose magnificence and sumptuous furniture were the subject of admiration and envy had his appartments covered every day in winter with clean straw and hay and in summer with green rushes or boughs Even the sovereign himself in those ages was provided with forage for his bed  Ibid p  These picturesque features and characteristical strokes of the times recal the imagination from the supposed distinction of monarch and subject to that state of rough familiarity in which our ancestors lived and under which they  acted with a view to objects and on principles of conduct which we seldom comprehend when we are employed to record their transactions or to study their characters  THUCYDIDES notwithstanding the prejudice of his country against the name of  Barbarian  understood that it was in the customs of barbarous nations he was to study the more ancient manners of Greece  THE Romans might have found an image of their own ancestors in the representations they have given of ours and if ever an Arab clan shall become a civilized nation or any American tribe escape the poison which is administered by our traders of Europe it may be from the relations of the present times and the descriptions which are now given by travellers that such a people in after ages may best collect the accounts of their origin It is in their present condition that we are to behold as in a mirrour the features of our own progenitors and from thence we are to draw our conclusions with respect to the influence of situations in which we have reason to believe our fathers were placed  WHAT should distinguish a German or a Briton in the habits of his mind or his body in his manners or apprehensions from an American who like him with his bow and his dart is left to traverse the forest and in a like severe or variable climate is obliged to subsist by the chace  IF in advanced years we would form a just notion of our progress from the cradle we must  have recourse to the nursery and from the example of those who are still in the period of life we mean to describe take our representation of past manners that cannot in any other way be recalled  SECT II  Of rude nations prior to the Establishment of Property  FROM one to the other extremity of America from Kamschatka westward to the river Oby and from the Northern sea over that length of country to the confines of China of India and Persia from the Caspian to the Red sea with little exception and from thence over the inland continent and the western shores of Africa we every where meet with nations on whom we bestow the appellations of barbarous or savage That extensive tract of the earth containing so great a variety of situation climate and soil should in the manners of its inhabitants exhibit all the diversities which arise from the unequal influence of the sun joined to a different nourishment and manner of life Every question however on this subject is premature till we have first endeavoured to form some general conception of our species in its rude state and have learned to distinguish mere ignorance from dullness and the want of arts from the want of capacity  OF the nations who dwell in those or any other of the less cultivated parts of the earth some intrust their subsistence chiefly to hunting fishing or the natural produce of the soil They have little attention to property and scarcely any beginnings of subordination or government Others having possessed themselves of herds and depending for their provision on pasture know what it is to be poor and rich They know the relations of patron and client of servant and master and suffer themselves to be classed according to their measures of wealth This distinction must create a material difference of character and may furnish two separate heads under which to consider the history of mankind in their rudest state that of the savage who is not yet acquainted with property and that of the barbarian to whom it is although not ascertained by laws a principal object of care and desire  IT must appear very evident that property is a matter of progress It requires among other particulars which are the effects of time some method of defining possession The very desire of it proceeds from experience and the industry by which it is gained or improved requires such a habit of acting with a view to distant objects as may overcome the present disposition either to sloth or to enjoyment This habit is slowly acquired and is in reality a principal distinction of nations in the advanced state of mechanic and commercial arts  IN a tribe which subsists by hunting and fishing the arms the utensils and the fur which  the individual carries are to him the only subjects of property The food of to morrow is yet wild in the forest or hid in the lake it cannot be appropriated before it is caught and even then being the purchase of numbers who fish or hunt in a body it accrues to the community and is applied to immediate use or becomes an accession to the stores of the public  WHERE savage nations as in most parts of America mix with the practice of hunting some species of rude agriculture they still follow with respect to the soil and the fruits of the earth the analogy of their principal object As the men hunt so the women labour together and after they have shared the toils of the seedtime they enjoy the fruits of the harvest in common The field in which they have planted like the district over which they are accustomed to hunt is claimed as a property by the nation but is not parcelled in lots to its members They go forth in parties to prepare the ground to plant and to reap The harvest is gathered into the public granary and from thence at stated times is divided into shares for the maintenance of separate families  History of the Caribbees  Even the returns of the market when they trade with foreigners are brought home to the stock of the nation  Charlevoix    AS the fur and the bow pertain to the individual the cabbin and its utensils are appropriated to the family and as the domestic cares are committed  to the women so the property of the household seems likewise to be vested in them The children are considered as pertaining to the mother with little regard to descent on the father's side The males before they are married remain in the cabbin in which they are born but after they have formed a new connection with the other sex they change their habitation and become an accession to the family in which they have found their wives The hunter and the warrior are numbered by the matron as a part of her treasure they are reserved for perils and trying occasions and in the recess of public councils in the intervals of hunting or war are maintained by the cares of the women and loiter about in mere amusement or sloth  Lafitau    WHILE one sex continue to value themselves chiefly on their courage their talent for policy and their warlike atchievments this species of property which is bestowed on the other is in reality a mark of subjection not as some writers alledge of their having acquired an ascendant  Ibid  It is the care and trouble of a subject with which the warrior does not chuse to be embarrassed It is a servitude and a continual toil where no honours are won and they whose province it is are in fact the slaves and the helots of their country If in this destination of the sexes while the men continue to indulge themselves in the contempt of sordid and mercenary arts the cruel establishment of slavery is for some ages deferred  if in this tender though unequal alliance the affections of the heart prevent the severities practised on slaves we have in the custom itself as perhaps in many other instances reason to prefer the first suggestions of nature to many of her after refinements  IF mankind in any instance continue the article of property on the footing we have now represented we may easily credit what is farther reported by travellers that they admit of no distinctions of rank or condition and that they have in fact no degree of subordination different from the distribution of function which follows the differences of age talents and dispositions Personal qualities give an ascendant in the midst of occasions which require their exertion but in times of relaxation leave no vestige of power or prerogative A warrior who has led the youth of his nation to the slaughter of their enemies or who has been foremost in the chace returns upon a level with the rest of his tribe and when the only business is to sleep or to feed can enjoy no preeminence for he sleeps and he feeds no better than they  WHERE no profit attends dominion one party is as much averse to the trouble of perpetual command as the other is to the mortification of perpetual submission  I love victory I love great actions  says Montesquieu in the character of Sylla  but have no relish for the languid detail of pacific government or the pageantry of high station  He has touched perhaps what is a prevailing sentiment in the simplest state of society when the weakness of motives suggested by  interest and the ignorance of any elevation not founded on merit supplies the place of disdain  THE character of the mind however in this state is not founded on ignorance alone Men are conscious of their equality and are tenacious of its rights Even when they follow a leader to the field they cannot brook the pretensions to a formal command they liften to no orders and they come under no military engagements but those of mutual fidelity and equal ardour in the enterprise  Charlevoix    THIS description we may believe is unequally applicable to different nations who have made unequal advances in the establishment of property Among the Caribbees and the other natives of the warmer climates in America the dignity of chieftain is hereditary or elective and continued for life the unequal distribution of property creates a visible subordination  Wafer's account of the Isthmus of Darien  But among the Iroquois and other nations of the temperate zone the titles of  magistrate  and  subject  of  noble  and  mean  are as little known as those of  rich  and  poor  The old men without being invested with any coercive power employ their natural authority in advising or in prompting the resolutions of their tribe the military leader is pointed out by the superiority of his manhood and valour the statesman is distinguished only by the attention with which his counsel is heard the warrior by the confidence with which the youth of his nation follow  him to the field and if their concerts must be supposed to constitute a species of political government it is one to which no language of ours can be applied Power is no more than the natural ascendency of the mind the discharge of office no more than a natural exercise of the personal character and while the community acts with an appearance of order there is no sense of disparity in the breast of any of its members  Colden's History of the Five Nations    IN these happy though informal proceedings where age alone gives a place in the council where youth ardour and valour in the field give a title to the station of leader where the whole community is assembled on any alarming occasion we may venture to say that we have found the origin of the senate the executive power and the assembly of the people institutions for which ancient legislators have been so much renowned The senate among the Greeks as well as the Latins appears from the etymology of its name to have been originally composed of elderly men The military leader at Rome in a manner not unlike to that of the American warrior proclaimed his levies and the citizen prepared for the field in consequence of a voluntary engagement The suggestions of nature which directed the policy of nations in the wilds of America were followed before on the banks of the Eurotas and the Tyber and Lycurgus and Romulus found the model of their institution where the members of every rude nation find the earliest mode of uniting their talents and combining their forces  AMONG the NorthAmerican nations every individual is independent but he is engaged by his affections and his habits in the cares of a family Families like so many separate tribes are subject to no inspection or government from abroad whatever passes at home even bloodshed and murder are only supposed to concern themselves They are in the mean time the parts of a canton the women assemble to plant their maize the old men go to council the huntsman and the warrior joins the youth of his village in the field Many such cantons assemble to constitute a national council or to execute a national enterprise When the Europeans made their first settlements in America six such nations had formed a league had their amphyctiones or statesgeneral and by the firmness of their union and the ability of their councils had obtained an ascendant from the mouth of the St Laurence to that of the Missisippi  Lafitau Charlevoix Colden  c  They appeared to understand the objects of the confederacy as well as those of the separate nation they studied a balance of power the statesman of one country watched the designs and proceedings of another and occasionally threw the weight of his tribe into a different scale They had their alliances and their treaties which like the nations of Europe they maintained or they broke upon reasons of state and remained at peace from a sense of necessity or expediency and went to war upon any emergence of provocation or jealousy  THUS without any settled form of government or any bond of union but what resembled more the suggestion of instinct than the invention of reason they conducted themselves with the concert and the force of nations Foreigners without being able to discover who is the magistrate or in what manner the senate is composed always find a council with whom they may treat or a band of warriors with whom they may fight Without police or compulsory laws their domestic society is conducted with order and the absence of vicious dispositions is a better security than any public establishment for the suppression of crimes  DISORDERS however sometimes occur especially in times of debauch when the immoderate use of intoxicating liquors to which they are extremely addicted suspends the ordinary caution of their demeanour and inflaming their violent passions engages them in quarrels and bloodshed When a person is slain his murderer is seldom called to an immediate account but he has a quarrel to sustain with the family and the friends or if a stranger with the countrymen of the deceased sometimes even with his own nation at home if the injury committed be of a kind to alarm the society The nation the canton or the family endeavour by presents to atone for the offence of any of their members and by pacifying the parties aggrieved endeavour to prevent what alarms the community more than the first disorder the subsequent effects of revenge and animosity  Lafitau  The shedding of blood however if  the guilty person remain where he has committed the crime seldom escapes unpunished the friend of the deceased knows how to disguise though not to suppress his resentment and even after many years have elapsed is sure to repay the injury that was done to his kindred or his house  THESE considerations render them cautious and circumspect put them on their guard against their passions and give to their ordinary deportment an air of phlegm and composure superior to what is possessed among polished nations They are in the mean time affectionate in their carriage and in their conversations pay a mutual attention and regard says Charlevoix more tender and more engaging than what we profess in the ceremonial of polished societies  THIS writer has observed that the nations among whom he travelled in North America never mentioned acts of generosity or kindness under the notion of duty They acted from affection as they acted from appetite without regard to its consequences When they had done a kindness they had gratified a desire the business was finished and it passed from the memory When they received a favour it might or it might not prove the occasion of friendship if it did not the parties appeared to have no apprehensions of gratitude as a duty by which the one was bound to make a return or the other intitled to reproach the person who had failed in his part The spirit with which they give or receive presents is the same which Tacitus observed among the ancient Germans They delight in them but do not  consider them as matter of obligation  Muneribus gaudent sed nec data imputant noc acceptis obligantur  Such gifts are of little consequence except when employed as the seal of a bargain or treaty  IT was their favourite maxim That no man is naturally indebted to another that he is not therefore obliged to bear with any imposition or unequal treatment  Charlevoix  Thus in a principle apparently fullen and inhospitable they have discovered the foundation of justice and observe its rules with a steadiness and candour which no cultivation has been found to improve The freedom which they give in what relates to the supposed duties of kindness and friendship serves only to engage the heart more entirely where it is once possessed with affection We love to chuse our object without any restraint and we consider kindness itself as a talk when the duties of friendship are exacted by rule We therefore by our demand for attentions rather corrupt than improve the system of morality and by our exactions of gratitude and our frequent proposals to inforce its observance we only shew that we have mistaken its nature we only give symptoms of that growing sensibility to interest from which we measure the expediency of friendship and generosity itself and by which we would introduce the spirit of traffic into the commerce of affection In consequence of this proceeding we are often obliged to decline a favour with the same spirit that we throw off a servile engagement or reject a bribe  To the unrefining savage every favour is welcome and every present received without reserve or reflection  THE love of equality and the love of justice were originally the same and although by the constitution of different societies unequal privileges are bestowed on their members and although justice itself requires a proper regard to be paid to such privileges yet he who has forgotten that men were originally equal easily degenerates into a slave or in the capacity of a master is not to be trusted with the rights of his fellowcreatures This happy principle gives to the mind its sense of independence renders it indifferent to the favours which are in the power of other men checks it in the commission of injuries and leaves the heart open to the affections of generosity and kindness It gives to the untutored American that air of candour and of regard to the welfare of others which in some degree softens the arrogant pride of his carriage and in times of confidence and peace without the assistance of government or law renders the approach and commerce of strangers secure  AMONG this people the foundations of honour are eminent abilities and great fortitude not the distinctions of equipage and fortune The talents in esteem are such as their situation leads them to employ the exact knowledge of a country and stratagem in war On these qualifications a captain among the Carribbes underwent an examination When a new leader was to be chosen a scout was sent forth to traverse the forests which led to the enemy's country and upon his return▪  the candidate was desired to find the track in which he had travelled A brook or a fountain was named to him on the frontier and he was desired to find the nearest path to a particular station and to plant a stake in the place  Latfiau  They can accordingly trace a wild beast or the human foot over many leagues of a pathless forest and find their way across a woody and uninhabited continent by means of refined observations which escape the traveller who has been accustomed to different aids They steer in slender cannoes across stormy seas with a dexterity equal to that of the most experienced Pilot  Charlevoix  They ca  y a penetrating eye for the thoughts and intentions of those with whom they have to deal and when they mean to deceive they cover themselves with arts which the most subtile can seldom elude They harangue in their public councils with a nervous and figurative elocution and conduct themselves in the management of their treaties with a perfect discernment of their national interests  THUS being able masters in the detail of their own affairs and well qualified to acquit themselves on particular occasions they study no science and go in pursuit of no general principles They even seem incapable of attending to any distant consequences beyond those they have experienced in hunting or war They intrust the provision of every season to itself consume the fruits of the earth in summer and in winter are driven in  quest of their prey through woods and over deserts covered with snow They do not form in one hour those maxims which may prevent the errors of the next and they fail in those apprehensions which in the intervals of passion produce ingenuous shame compassion remorse or a command of appetite They are seldom made to repent of any violence nor is a person indeed thought accountable in his sober mood for what he did in the heat of a passion or in a time of debauch  THEIR superstitions are groveling and mean and did this happen among rude nations alone we could not sufficiently admire the effects of politeness but it is a subject on which few nations are intitled to censure their neighbours When we have considered the superstitions of one people we find little variety in those of another They are but a repetition of similar weaknesses and absurdities derived from a common source a perplexed apprehension of invisible agents that are supposed to guide all precarious events to which human foresight cannot extend  IN what depends on the known or the regular course of nature the mind trusts to itself but in strange and uncommon situations it is the dupe of its own perplexity and instead of relying on its prudence or courage has recourse to divination and a variety of observances that for being irrational are always the more revered Superstition being founded in doubts and anxiety is fostered by ignorance and mystery Its maxims in the mean time are not always confounded with those of common life nor does its weakness or folly always prevent the watchfulness penetration and  courage men are accustomed to employ in the management of common affairs A Roman consulting futurity by the pecking of birds or a King of Sparta inspecting the intrails of a beast Mithridates consulting his women on the interpretation of his dreams are examples sufficient to prove that a childish imbecility on this subject is consistent with the greatest military and political talents  CONFIDENCE in the effect of superstitious observances is not peculiar to any age or nation Few even of the accomplished Greeks and Romans were able to shake off this weakness In their case it was not removed by the highest measures of civilization It has yielded only to the light of true religion or to the study of nature by which we are led to substitute a wise providence operating by physical causes in the place of phantoms that terrify or amuse the ignorant  THE principal point of honour among the rude nations of America as indeed in every instance where mankind are not greatly corrupted is sortitude Yet their way of maintaining this point of honour is very different from that of the nations of Europe Their ordinary method of making war is by ambuscade and they strive by overreaching an enemy to commit the greatest slaughter or to make the greatest number of prisoners with the least hazard to themselves They deem it a folly to expose their own persons in assaulting an enemy and do not rejoice in victories which are stained with the blood of their own people They do not value themselves as in Europe on defying their enemy upon equal terms They  even boast that they approach like foxes or that they fly like birds not less than that they devour like lions In Europe to fall in battle is accounted an honour among the natives of America it is reckoned disgraceful  Charlevoix  They reserve their fortitude for the trials they abide when attacked by surprise or when fallen into their enemies hands and when they are obliged to maintain their own honour and that of their nation in the midst of torments that require efforts of patience more than of valour  ON these occasions they are far from allowing it to be supposed that they wish to decline the conflict It is held infamous to avoid it even by a voluntary death and the greatest affront which can be offered to a prisoner is to refuse him the honours of a man in the manner of his execution  Withhold  says an old man in the midst of his torture  the stabs of your knife rather let me die by fire that those dogs your allies from beyond the seas may learn to suffer like men  Colden    With terms of defiance the victim in those solemn trials commonly excites the animosity of his tormentors as well as his own and whilst we suffer for human nature under the effect of its errors we must admire its force  THE people with whom this practice prevailed were commonly desirous of repairing their own losses by adopting prisoners of war into their families and even in the last moment the hand  which was raised to torment frequently gave the sign of adoption by which the prisoner became the child or the brother of his enemy and came to share in all the privileges of a citizen In their treatment of those who suffered they did not appear to be guided by principles of hatred or revenge they observed the point of honour in applying as well as in bearing their torments and by a strange kind of affection and tenderness were directed to be most cruel where they intended the highest respect the coward was put to immediate death by the hands of women the valiant was supposed to be intitled to all the trials of fortitude that men could invent or employ  It gave me joy  says an old man to his captive  that so gallant a youth was allotted to my share I proposed to have placed you on the couch of my nephew who was slain by your countrymen to have transferred all my tenderness to you and to have solaced my age in your company but maimed and mutilated as you now appear death is better than life prepare yourself therefore to die like a man  Charlevoix    IT is perhaps with a view to these exhibitions or rather in admiration of fortitude the principle from which they proceed that the Americans are so attentive in their earliest years to harden their nerves  Ib  This writer says that he has seen a boy and a girl having bound their naked arms together place a burning coal between them to try who would shake it off first  The children are taught to vie with each other in bearing the sharpest torments the  youth are admitted into the class of manhood after violent proofs of their patience and leaders are put to the test by famine burning and suffocation  Lafitau    IT might be apprehended that among rude nations where the means of subsistence are procured with so much difficulty the mind could never raise itself above the consideration of this subject and that man would in this condition give examples of the meanest and most mercenary spirit The reverse however is true Directed in this particular by the desires of nature men in their simplest state attend to the objects of appetite no further than appetite requires and their desires of fortune extend no further than the meal which gratifies their hunger they apprehend no superiority of rank in the possession of wealth such as might inspire any habitual principle of covetousness vanity or ambition they can apply to no task that engages no immediate passion and take pleasure in no occupation that affords no dangers to be braved and no honours to be won  IT was not among the ancient Romans alone that commercial arts or a sordid mind were held in contempt A like spirit prevails in every rude and independent society  I am a warrior and not a merchant  said an American to the governor of Canada who proposed to give him goods in exchange for some prisoners he had taken  your cloaths and utensils do not tempt me but my prisoners are now in your power and  you may seize them if you do I must go forth and take more prisoners or perish in the attempt and if that chance should besal me I shall die like a man but remember that our nation will charge you as the cause of my death  Charlevoix    With these apprehensions they have an elevation and a stateliness of carriage which the pride of nobility where it is most revered by polished nations seldom bestows  THEY are attentive to their persons and employ much time as well as endure great pain in the methods they take to adorn their bodies to give the permanent stains with which they are coloured or preserve the paint which they are perpetually repairing in order to appear with advantage  THEIR aversion to every sort of employment which they hold to be mean makes them pass great part of their time in idleness or sleep and a man who in pursuit of a wild beast or to surprise his enemy will traverse a hundred leagues on snow will not to procure his food submit to any species of ordinary labour  Strange  says Tacitus  that the same person should be so much averse to repose and so much addicted to sloth  GAMES of hazard are not the invention of polished ages men of curiosity have looked for their origin in vain among the monuments of an  obscure antiquity and it is probable that they belonged to times too remote and too rude even for the conjectures of antiquarians to reach The very savage brings his furs his utensils and his beads to the hazardtable he finds here the passions and agitations which the applications of a tedions industry could not excite and while the throw is depending he tears his hair and beats his breast with a rage which the more accomplished gamester has sometimes learned to repress he often quits the party naked and stripped of all his possessions or where slavery is in use stakes his freedom to have one chance more to recover his former loss  Tacitus Lafitau Charlevoix    WITH all these infirmities vices or respectable qualities belonging to the human species in its rudest state the love of society friendship and public affection penetration eloquence and courage appear to have been its original properties not the subsequent effects of device or invention If mankind are qualified to improve their manners the subject was furnished by nature and the effect of cultivation is not to inspire the sentiments of tenderness and generosity nor to bestow the principal constituents of a respectable character but to obviate the casual abuses of passion and to prevent a mind which feels the best dispositions in their greatest force from being at times likewise the sport of brutal appetite and ungovernable violence  WERE Lycurgus employed anew to operate on the materials we have described he would find them in many important particulars prepared by nature herself for his use His equality in matters of property being already established he would have no faction to apprehend from the opposite interests of the poor and the rich his senate his assembly of the people is constituted his discipline is in some measure adopted and the place of his helots is supplied by the task allotted to one of the sexes With all these advantages he would still have had a very important lesson for civil society to teach that by which a few learn to command and the many are taught to obey he would have all his precautions to take against the future intrusion of mercenary arts the admiration of luxury and the passion for interest he would still perhaps have a more difficult task than any of the former in teaching his citizens the command of appetite and an indifference to pleasure as well as a contempt of pain in teaching them to maintain in the field the formality of uniform precautions and as much to avoid being themselves surprised as they endeavour to surprise their enemy  FOR want of these advantages rude nations in general though they are patient of hardship and fatigue though they are addicted to war and are qualified by their stratagem and valour to throw terror into the armies of a more regular enemy yet in the course of a continued struggle always yield to the superior arts and the discipline of more civilized nations Hence the Romans  were able to overrun the provinces of Gaul Germany and Britain and hence the Europeans have a growing ascendency over the nations of Africa and America  ON the credit of a superiority which certain nations possess they think that they have a claim to dominion and even Caesar appears to have forgotten what were the passions as well as the rights of mankind when he complained that the Britons after having sent him a submissive message to Gaul perhaps to prevent his invasion still pretended to fight for their liberties and to oppose his descent on their island  Caesar questus quod quum ultro in continentem legatis missis pacem a se petissent bellum sine causa intulissent  Lib    THERE is not perhaps in the whole description of mankind a circumstance more remarkable than that mutual contempt and aversion which nations under a different state of commercial arts bestow on each other Addicted to their own pursuits and considering their own condition as the standard of human felicity all nations pretend to the preference and in their practice give sufficient proof of sincerity Even the savage still less than the citizen can be made to quit that manner of life in which he is trained he loves that freedom of mind which will not be bound to any task and which owns no superior however tempted to mix with polished nations and to better his fortune the first moment of liberty brings him back to the woods again he droops and he pines  in the streets of the populous city he wanders dissatisfied over the open and the cultivated field he seeks the frontier and the forest where with a constitution prepared to undergo the hardships and the difficulties of the situation he enjoys a delicious freedom from care and a seducing society where no rules of behaviour are prescribed but the simple dictates of the heart  SECT III  Of Rude Nations under the Impressions of Property and Interest  IT was a proverbial imprecation in use among the hunting nations on the confines of Siberia That their enemy might be obliged to live like a Tartar and be seized with the folly of breeding and attending his cattle  Abulgaze's Genealogical History of the Tartars  Nature it seems in their apprehension by storing the woods and the desert with game rendered the task of the herdsman unnecessary and left to man only the trouble of selecting and of seizing his prey  THE indolence of mankind or rather their aversion to any application in which they are not engaged by immediate instinct and passion retards their progress in extending the notion of property It has been found however even while the means of subsistence are left in common and the stock of the public is yet undivided that this notion is already applied to different subjects as the sur and the bow pertain to the individual the cottage with its furniture are appropiated to the family  WHEN the parent begins to desire a better provision for his children than is sound under the  promiscuous management of many copartners when he has applied his labour and his skill apart he aims at an exclusive possession and seeks the property of the soil as well as the use of its fruits  WHEN the individual no longer finds among his associates the same inclination to commit every subject to public use he is seized with concern for his personal fortune and is alarmed by the cares which every person entertains for himself He is urged as much by emulation and jealousy as by the sense of necessity He suffers considerations of interest to rest on his mind and when every present appetite is sufficiently gratified he can act with a view to futurity or rather finds an object of vanity in having amassed what is become a subject of competition and a matter of universal esteem Upon this motive where violence is restrained he can apply his hand to lucrative arts confine himself to a tedious task and wait with patience for the distant returns of his labour  THUS mankind acquire industry by many and by slow degrees They are taught to regard their interest they are taught to abstain from unlawful profits they are secured in the possession of what they fairly obtain and by these methods the habits of the labourer the mechanic and the trader are gradualiy formed A hoard collected from the simple productions of nature or a herd of cattle are in every rude nation the first species of wealth The circumstances of the soil and the climate determine whether the inhabitant shall apply himself chiefly to agriculture or pasture  whether he shall fix his residence or be moving continually about with all his possessions  IN the west of Europe in America from south to north with a few exceptions in the torrid zone and every where within the warmer climates mankind have generally applied themselves to some species of agriculture and have been disposed to settlement In the east and the north of Asia they depended entirely on their herds and were perpetually shifting their ground in search of new pasture The arts which pertain to settlement have been practised and variously cultivated by the inhabitants of Europe Those which are consistent with perpetual migration have from the earliest accounts of history remained nearly the same with the Scythian or Tartar The tent pitched on a moveable carriage the horse applied to every purpose of labour and of war of the dairy and of the butcher's stall from the earliest to the latest accounts have made up the riches and equipage of this wandering people  BUT in whatever way rude nations subsist there are certain points in which under the first impressions of property they nearly agree Homer either lived with a people in this stage of their progress or found himself engaged to exhibit their character Tacitus has made them the subject of a particular treatise and if this be an aspect under which mankind deserve to be viewed it must be confessed that we have singular advantages in collecting their features The portrait has already been drawn by the ablest hands and gives at one view in the writings of these celebrated authors whatever has been scattered in the relations of historians or whatever we have opportunities  to observe in the actual manners of men who still remain in a similar state  IN passing from the condition we have described to this we have at present in view mankind still retain many parts of their earliest character They are still averse to labour addicted to war admirers of fortitude and in the language of Tacitus more lavish of their blood than of their sweat  Pigrum quin immo et iners videtur sudore acquirere quod possis sanguine parare  They are fond of fantastic ornaments in their dress and endeavour to fill up the listless intervals of a life addicted to violence with hazardous sports and with games of chance Every servile occupation they commit to women or slaves But we may apprehend that the individual having now found a separate interest the bands of society must become less firm and domestic disorders more frequent The members of any community being distinguished among themselves by unequal shares in the distribution of property the ground of a permanent and palpable subordination is laid  THESE particulars accordingly take place among mankind in passing from the savage to what may be called the barbarous state Members of the same community enter into quarrels of competition or revenge They unite in following leaders who are distinguished by their fortunes and by the lustre of their birth They join the desire of spoil with the love of glory and from an opinion that what is acquired by force  justly pertains to the victor they become hunters of men and bring every contest to the decision of the sword  EVERY nation is a band of robbers who prey without restraint or remorse on their neighbours Cattle says Achilles may be seized in every field and the coasts of the Aegean sea were accordingly pillaged by the heroes of Homer for no other reason than because those heroes chose to possess themselves of the brass and iron the cattle the slaves and the women which were found among the nations around them  A Tartar mounted on his horse is an animal of prey who only inquires where cattle are to be found and how far he must go to possess them The monk who had fallen under the displeasure of Mangu Chan made his peace by promising that the Pope and the Christian princes should make a surrender of all their herds  Rubruquis    A similar spirit reigned without exception in all the barbarous nations of Europe Asia and Africa The antiquities of Greece and Italy and the fables of every ancient poet contain examples of its force It was this spirit that brought our ancestors first into the provinces of the Roman empire and that afterward more perhaps than their reverence for the cross led them to the East to share with the Tartars in the spoils of the Saracen empire  FROM the descriptions contained in the last section we may incline to believe that mankind in their simplest state are on the eve of erecting republics Their love of equality their habit of assembling in public councils and their zeal for the tribe to which they belong are qualifications that fit them to act under that species of government and they seem to have but a few steps to make in order to reach its establishment They have only to define the numbers of which their councils shall consist and to settle the forms of their meeting They have only to bestow a permanent authority for repressing disorders and to enact a few rules in favour of that justice they have already acknowledged and from inclination so strictly observe  BUT these steps are far from being so easily made as they appear on a slight or a transient view The resolution of chusing from among their equals the magistrate to whom they give from thenceforward a right to controul their own actions is far from the thoughts of simple men and no eloquence perhaps could make them adopt this measure or give them any sense of its use  EVEN after nations have chosen a military leader they do not intrust him with any species of civil authority The captain among the Caribbees did not pretend to decide in domestic disputes the terms  jurisdiction  and  government  were unknown in their tongue  History of the Caribbees    BEFORE this important change is admitted men must be accustomed to the distinction of ranks and before they are sensible that subordination is matter of choice must arrive at unequal conditions by chance In desiring property they only mean to secure their subsistence but the brave who lead in war have likewise the largest share in its spoils The eminent are fond of devising hereditary honours and the multitude who admire the parent are ready to extend their esteem to his offspring  POSSESSIONS descend and the lustre of family grows brighter with age Hercules who perhaps was an eminent warrior became a god with posterity and his race was set apart for royalty and sovereign power When the distinctions of fortune and those of birth are conjoined the chieftain enjoys a preeminence as well at the feast as in the field His followers take their place in subordinate stations and instead of considering themselves as parts of a community they rank as the followers of a chieftain and take their designation from the name of their leader They find a new object of public affection in defending his person and in supporting his station they lend of their substance to form his estate they are guided by his smiles and his frowns and court as the highest distinction a share in the feast which their own contributions have furnished  AS the former state of mankind seemed to point at democracy this seems to exhibit the rudiments of monarchical government But it is yet far short of that establishment which is known in  after ages by the name of  monarchy  The distinction between the leader and the follower the prince and the subject is still but imperfectly marked their pursuits and occupations are not different their minds are not unequally cultivated they feed from the same dish they sleep together on the ground the children of the king as well as those of the subject are employed in tending the flock and the keeper of the swine was a prime counsellor at the court of Ulysses  THE chieftain sufficiently distinguished from his tribe to excite their admiration and to flatter their vanity by a supposed affinity to his noble descent is the object of their veneration not of their envy he is considered as the common bond of connection not as their common master is foremost in danger and has a principal share in their troubles his glory is placed in the number of his attendants in his superior magnanimity and valour that of his followers in being ready to shed their blood in his service  Tacitus de moribus Germanorum    THE frequent practice of war tends to strengthen the bands of society and the practice of depredation itself engages men in trials of mutual attachment and courage What threatened to ruin and overset every good disposition in the human breast what seemed to banish justice from the societies of men tends to unite the species in clans and fraternities formidable indeed and hostile to one another but in the domestic society of each faithful disinterested and generous Frequent  dangers and the experience of fidelity and valour awaken the love of those virtues render them a subject of admiration and endear their possessors  ACTUATED by great passions the love of glory and the desire of victory roused by the menaces of an enemy or stung with revenge in suspense between the prospects of ruin or conquest the barbarian spends every moment of relaxation in the indulgence of sloth He cannot descend to the pursuits of industry or mechanical labour the beast of prey is a sluggard the hunter and the warrior sleeps while women or slaves are made to toil for his bread But shew him a quarry at a distance he is bold impetuous artful and rapacious no bar can withstand his violence and no fatigue can allay his activity  EVEN under this description mankind are generous and hospital to strangers as well as kind affectionate and gentle in their domestic society  Jean du Plan Carpen Rubruquis Caesar Tacit  Friendship and enmity are to them terms of the greatest importance they mingle not their functions together they have singled out their enemy and they have chosen their friend Even in depredation the principal object is glory and spoil is considered as a badge of victory Nations and tribes are their prey the solitary traveller by whom they can acquire only the reputation of generosity is suffered to pass unhurt or is treated with splendid munificence  THOUGH distinguished into small cantons under their several chieftains and for the most part separated by jealousy and animosity yet when pressed by wars and formidable enemies they sometimes unite in greater bodies Like the Greeks in their expedition to Troy they follow some remarkable leader and compose a kingdom of many separate tribes But such coalitions are merely occasional and even during their continuance more resemble republic than monarchy The inferior chieftains reserve their importance and intrude with an air of equality into the councils of their leader as the people of their several clans commonly intrude upon them  Kolbe Description of the Cape of Good Hope  Upon what motive indeed could we suppose that men who live together in the greatest familiarity and amongst whom the distinctions of rank are so obscurely marked would resign their personal sentiments and inclinations or pay an implicit submission to a leader who can neither overawe nor corrupt  MILITARY force must be employed to extort or the hire of the venal to buy that engagement which the Tartar comes under to his prince when he promises  That he will go where he shall be commanded that he will come when he shall be called that he will kill whoever is pointed out to him and for the future that he will consider the voice of the King as a sword  Simon de St Quintin    THESE are the terms to which even the stubborn heart of the barbarian has been reduced in consequence of a despotism he himself had established and men have in that low state of the commercial arts in Europe as well as in Asia tasted of political slavery When interest prevails in every breast the sovereign and his party cannot escape the infection he employs the force with which he is intrusted to turn his people into a property and to command their possessions for his profit or pleasure If riches are by any people made the standard of good and of evil let them beware of the powers they intrust to their prince  With the Suiones  says Tacitus  riches are in high esteem and this people are accordingly disarmed and reduced to slavery  De moribus Germanorum    IT is in this woful condition that mankind being slavish interested insidious deceitful and bloody bear marks if not of the least curable surely of the most lamentable sort of corruption  Chardin's Travels  Among them war is the mere practice of rapine to enrich the individual commerce is turned into a system of snares and impositions and government by turns oppressive or weak  IT were happy for the human race when guided by interest and not governed by laws that being split into nations of a moderate extent they found in every canton some natural bar to its further enlargement and met with occupation enough in  maintaining their independence without being able to extend their dominion  THERE is not disparity of rank among men in rude ages sufficient to give their communities the form of legal monarchy and in a territory of considerable extent when united under one head the warlike and turbulent spirit of its inhabitants seems to require the bridle of despotism and military force Where any degree of freedom remains the powers of the prince are as they were in most of the rude monarchies of Europe extremely precarious and depend chiefly on his personal character where on the contrary the powers of the prince are above the control of his people they are likewise above the restrictions of law Rapacity and terror become the predominant motives of conduct and form the character of the only parties into which mankind are divided that of the oppressor and that of the oppressed  THIS calamity threatened Europe for ages under the conquest and settlement of its new inhabitants  See Hume's history of the TudorsThere seemed to be nothing wanting to establish a perfect despotism in that house but a few regiments of troops under the command of the crown  It has actually taken place in Asia where similar conquests have been made and even without the ordinary opiates of effeminacy or a servile weakness founded on luxury it has surprised the Tartar on his wain in the rear of his herds Among this people in the heart of a great continent bold and enterprising warriors arose they subdued by surprise or superior abilities  the contiguous hords they gained in their progress accessions of numbers and of strength and like a torrent increasing as it descends became too strong for any bar that could be opposed to their passage The conquering tribe during a succession of ages furnished the prince with his guards and while they themselves were allowed to share in its spoils were the voluntary tools of oppression In this manner has despotism and corruption made their way into regions so much renowned for the wild freedom of nature a power which was the terror of every effeminate province is disarmed and the nursery of nations is itself gone to decay  See the History of the Huns    WHERE rude nations escape this calamity they require the exercise of foreign wars to maintain domestic peace when no enemy appears from abroad they have leisure for private feuds and employ that courage in their dissensions at home which in time of war is employed in defence of their country  AMONG the Gauls  says Caesar  there are subdivisions not only in every nation and in every district and village but almost in every house every one must fly to some patron for protection  De Bello Gallico lib    In this distribution of parties not only the feuds of clans but the quarrels of families even the differences and competitions of individuals are decided by force The sovereign when unassisted by superstition endeavours in vain  to employ his jurisdiction or to procure a submission to the decisions of law By a people who are accustomed to owe their possessions to violence and who despise fortune itself without the reputation of courage no umpire is admitted but the sword Scipio offered his arbitration to terminate the competition of two Spaniards in a disputed succession  That  said they  we have already refused to our relations we do not submit our difference to the judgement of men and even among the gods we appeal to Mars alone  Livy  IT is well known that the nations of Europe carried this mode of proceeding to a degree of formality unheard of in other parts of the world the civil and criminal judge could in most cases do no more than appoint the list and leave the parties to decide their cause by the combat they apprehended that the victor had a verdict of the gods in his favour and when they dropped in any instance this extraordinary form of process they substituted in its place some other more capricious appeal to chance in which they likewise thought that the judgement of the gods was declared  THE fierce nations of Europe were even fond of the combat as an exercise and a sport In the absence of real quarrels companions challenged each other to a trial of skill in which one of them frequently perished When Spicio celebrated the funeral of his father and his uncle the Spaniards came in pairs to fight and by a public exhibition of their duels to increase the solemnity  Ib lib    IN this wild and lawless state where the effects of true religion would have been so desireable and so salutary superstition frequently disputes the ascendant even with the admiration of valour and an order of men like the Druids among the ancient Gauls and Britons  Caesar  or some pretender to divination as at the Cape of Good Hope finds in the credit which is paid to his sorcery a way to the possession of power his magic wand comes in competition with the sword itself and in the manner of the Druids gives the first rudiments of civil government to some or like the supposed descendent of the sun among the Natchez and the Lama among the Tartars to others an early taste of despotism and absolute slavery  WE are generally at a loss to conceive how mankind can subsist under customs and manners extremely different from our own and we are apt to exaggerate the misery of barbarous times by an imagination of what we ourselves should suffer in a situation to which we are not accustomed But every age hath its consolations as well as its sufferings  Priscus when employed on an embassy to Attila was accosted in Greek by a person who wore the dress of a Scythian Having expressed surprise and being desirous to know the cause of his stay in so wild a company was told that this Greek had been a captive and for some time a slave till he obtained his liberty in reward of some remarkable action  I live more happily here  says he  than ever I did under the Roman government for they who live with the Scythians if they can endure the fatigues of war have nothing else to molest them they enjoy their possessions undisturbed whereas you are continually a prey to foreign enemies or to bad government you are forbid to carry arms in your own defence you suffer from the remissness and ill conduct of those who are appointed to protect you the evils of peace are even worse than those of war no punishment is ever inflicted on the powerful or the rich no mercy is shown to the poor although your institutions were wisely devised yet in the management of corrupted men their effects are pernicious and cruel  Excerpta de legationibus  In the interval of occasional  outrages the friendly intercourses of men even in their rudest condition is affectionate and happy  D'Arvieux's Hist of the Wild Arabs  In rude ages the persons and properties of individuals are secure because each has a friend as well as an enemy and if the one is disposed to molest the other is ready to protect and the very admiration of valour which in some instances tends to sanctify violence inspires likewise certain maxims of generosity and honour that tend to prevent the Commission of wrongs  MEN bear with the defects of their policy as they do with hardships and inconveniencies in their manner of living The alarms and the fatigues of war become a necessary recreation to those who are accustomed to them and who have the tone of their passions raised above less animating or trying occasions Old men among the courtiers of Attila wept when they heard of heroic deeds which they themselves could no longer perform  Ibid  And among the Celtic nations when age rendered the warrior unfit for his former toils it was the custom in order to abridge the languors of a listless  and inactive life to sue for death at the hands of his friends  Ubi transcendit florentes viribus annos  Impatiens aevi spernit novisse senectam  Silius lib    WITH all this ferocity of spirit the rude nations of the West were subdued by the policy and more regular warfare of the Romans The point of honour which the barbarians of Europe adopted as individuals exposed them to a peculiar disadvantage by rendering them even in their national wars averse to assailing their enemy by surprise or taking the benefit of stratagem and though separately bold and intrepid yet like other rude nations they were when assembled in great bodies addicted to superstition and subject to panics  THEY were from a consciousness of their personal courage and force sanguine on the eve of battle they were beyond the bounds of moderation elated on success and dejected in adversity and being disposed to consider every event as a judgement of the gods they were never qualified by an uniform application of prudence to make the most of their forces to repair their misfortunes or to improve their advantages  RESIGNED to the government of affection and passion they were generous and faithful where they had fixed an attachment implacable froward and cruel where they had conceived a dislike addicted to debauchery and the immoderate  use of intoxicating liquors they deliberated on the affairs of state in the heat of their riot and in the same dangerous moments conceived the designs of military enterprise or terminated their domestic dissensions by the dagger or the sword  IN their wars they preferred death to captivity The victorious armies of the Romans in entering a town by assault or in forcing an incampment have found the mother in the act of destroying her children that they might not be taken and the dagger of the parent red with the blood of his family ready to be plunged at last into his own breast  Liv lib xli Dio Cass    IN all these particulars we perceive that vigour of spirit which renders disorder itself respectable and which qualifies men if fortunate in their situation to lay the basis of domestic liberty as well as to maintain against foreign enemies their national independence and freedom  PART THIRD  Of the History of Policy and Arts  SECT I  Of the Influences of Climate and Situation  WHAT we have hitherto observed on the condition and manners of nations though chiefly derived from what has passed in the temperate climates may in some measure be applied to the rude state of mankind in every part of the earth but if we intend to pursue the history of our species in its further attainments we may soon enter on subjects which will confine our observation to more narrow limits The genius of political wisdom and civil arts appears to have chosen his seats in particular tracts of the earth and to have selected his favourites in particular races of men  MAN in his animal capacity is qualified to subsist in every climate He reigns with the lion and the tyger under the equatorial heats of the sun or he associates with the bear and the raindeer beyond the polar circle His versatile disposition fits him to assume the habits of either condition or his talent for arts enables him to supply its defects The intermediate climates however appear most to favour his nature and in whatever manner we account for the fact it cannot be doubted that this animal has always attained to the principal honours of his species within the temperate zone The arts which he has on this scene repeatedly invented the extent of his reason the fertility of his fancy and the force of his genius in literature commerce policy and war sufficiently declare either a distinguished advantage of situation or a natural superiority of mind  THE most remarkable races of men it is true have been rude before they were polished They have in some cases returned to rudeness again and it is not from the actual possession of arts science or policy that we are to pronounce of their genius  THERE is a vigour a reach of capacity and a sensibility of mind which may characterise as well the savage as the citizen the slave as well as the master and the same powers of the mind may be turned to a variety of purposes A modern Greek perhaps is mischievous slavish and cunning from the same animated temperament that made his ancestor ardent ingenious and bold in the camp or in the council of his nation  A modern Italian is distinguished by sensibility quickness and art while he employs on trifles the capacity of an ancient Roman and exhibits now in the scene of amusement and in the search of a frivolous applause that fire and those passions with which Gracchus burned in the Forum and shook the assemblies of a severer people  THE commercial and lucrative arts have been in some climates the principal object of mankind and have been retained through every disaster in others even under all the fluctuations of fortune they have still been neglected while in the temperate climates of Europe and Asia they have had their ages of admiration as well as contempt  IN one state of society arts are slighted from that very ardour of mind and principle of activity by which in another they are practised with the greatest success While men are ingrossed by their passions heated and roused by the struggles and dangers of their country while the trumpet sounds or the alarm of social engagement is rung and the heart beats high it were a mark of dullness or of an abject spirit to find leisure for the study of ease or the pursuit of improvements which have mere convenience or ease for their object  THE frequent vicissitudes and reverses of fortune which nations have experienced on that very ground where the arts have prospered are probably the effects of a busy inventive and versatile spirit by which men have carried every national  pursuit to extremes They have raised the fabric of despotic empire to its greatest height where they had best understood the foundations of freedom They perished in the flames which they themselves had kindled and they only perhaps were capable of displaying by turns the greatest improvements or the lowest corruptions to which the human mind can be brought  ON this scene mankind have twice within the compass of history ascended from rude beginnings to very high degrees of refinement In every age whether destined by its temporary disposition to build or to destroy they have left the vestiges of an active and vehement spirit The pavement and the ruins of Rome are buried in dust shaken from the feet of barbarians who trod with contempt on the refinements of luxury and spurned those arts the use of which it was reserved for the posterity of the same people to discover and to admire The tents of the wild Arab are even now pitched among the ruins of magnificent cities and the waste fields which border on Palestine and Syria are perhaps become again the nursery of infant nations The chieftain of an Arab tribe like the founder of Rome may have already fixed the roots of a plant that is to flourish in some future period or laid the foundations of a fabric that will attain to its grandeur in some distant age  GREAT part of Africa has been always unknown but the silence of same on the subject of its revolutions is an argument where no other proof can be found of weakness in the genius of its people The torrid zone every where round  the globe however known to the geographer has furnished few materials for history and though in many places supplied with the arts of life in no contemptible degree has no where matured the more important projects of political wisdom nor inspired the virtues which are connected with freedom and required in the conduct of civil affairs  IT was indeed in the torrid zone that mere arts of mechanism and manufacture were found among the inhabitants of the new world to have made the greatest advance it is in India and in the regions of this hemisphere which are visited by the vertical sun that the arts of manufacture and the practice of commerce are of the greatest antiquity and have survived with the smallest diminution the ruins of time and the revolutions of empire  THE sun it seems which ripens the pineapple and the tamarind inspires a degree of mildness that can even assuage the rigours of despotical government and such is the effect of a gentle and pacific disposition in the natives of the East that no conquest no irruption of barbarians terminates as they did among the stubborn natives of Europe by a total destruction of what the love of ease and of pleasure had produced  TRANSFERRED without any great struggle from one master to another the natives of India are ready upon every change to pursue their industry to acquiesce in the enjoyment of life and the hopes of animal pleasure the wars of conquest are not prolonged to exasperate the parties engaged in them or to desolate the land for  which those parties contend even the barbarous invader leaves untouched the commercial settlement which has not provoked his rage though master of opulent cities he only incamps in their neighbourhood and leaves to his heirs the option of entering by degrees on the pleasures the vices and the pageantries his acquisitions afford his successors still more than himself are disposed to foster the hive in proportion as they taste more of its sweets and they spare the inhabitant together with his dwelling as they spare the herd or the stall of which they are become the proprietors  THE modern description of India is a repetition of the ancient and the present state of China is derived from a distant antiquity to which there is no parallel in the history of mankind The succession of monarchs has been changed but no revolutions have affected the state The African and the Samoiede are not more uniform in their ignorance and barbarity than the Chinese and the Indian if we may credit their own story have been in the practice of manufacture and in the obser+vance of a certain police which was calculated only to regulate their traffic and to protect them in their application to servile or lucrative arts  IF we pass from these general representations of what mankind have done to the more minute description of the animal himself as he has occupied different climates and is diversified in his temper complexion and character we shall find a variety of genius corresponding to the effects of his conduct and the result of his story  MAN in the perfection of his natural faculties is quick and delicate in his sensibility extensive and various in his imaginations and reflections attentive penetrating and subtile in what relates to his fellowcreatures firm and ardent in his purposes devoted to friendship or to enmity jealous of his independence and his honour which he will not relinquish for safety or for profit under all his corruptions or improvements he retains his natural sensibility if not his force and his commerce is a blessing or a curse according to the direction his mind has received  BUT under the extremes of heat or of cold the active range of the human soul appears to be limited and men are of inferior importance either as friends or as enemies In the one extreme they are dull and slow moderate in their desires regular and pacific in their manner of life in the other they are feverish in their passions weak in their judgements and addicted by temperament to animal pleasure In both the heart is mercenary and makes important concessions for childish bribes in both the spirit is prepared for servitude in the one it is subdued by fear of the future in the other it is not roused even by its sense of the present  THE nations of Europe who would settle or conquer on the south or the north of their own happier climates find little resistance they extend their dominion at pleasure and find no where a limit but in the ocean and in the satiety of conquest With few of the pangs and the struggles that precede the reduction of nations mighty provinces  have been successively annexed to the territory of Russia and its sovereign who accounts within his domain entire tribes with whom perhaps none of his emissaries have ever conversed dispatched a few geometers to extend his empire and thus to execute a project in which the Romans were obliged to employ their consuls and their legions  See Russian Atlas  These modern conquerors complain of rebellion where they meet with repugnance and are surprised at being treated as enemies where they come to impose their tribute  IT appears however that on the shores of the Eastern sea they have met with nations  Tchutzi  who have questioned their title to reign and who have considered the requisition of a tax as the demand of effects for nothing Here perhaps may be found the genius of ancient Europe and under its name of ferocity the spirit of national independence  Notes to the Genealogical History of the Tartars  that spirit which disputed its ground in the West with the victorious armies of Rome and baffled the attempts of the Persian monarchs to comprehend the villages of Greece within the bounds of their extensive dominion  THE great and striking diversities which obtain betwixt the inhabitants of climates far removed from each other are like the varieties of other animals in different regions easily observed The horse and the raindeer are just emblems of the Arab and the Laplander the native of Arabia  like the animal for whose race his country is famed whether wild in the woods or tutored by art is lively active and fervent in the exercise on which he is bent This race of men in their rude state fly to the desert for freedom and in roving bands alarm the frontiers of empire and strike a terror in the province to which their moving encampments advance  D'Arvieux  When roused by the prospect of conquest or disposed to act on a plan they spread their dominion and their system of imagination over mighty tracts of the earth when possessed of property and of settlement they set the example of a lively invention and superior ingenuity in the practice of arts and the study of science The Laplander on the contrary like the associate of his climate is hardy indefatigable and patient of famine dull rather than tame serviceable in a particular tract and incapable of change Whole nations continue from age to age in the same condition and with immoveable phlegm submit to the appellations of  Dane  of  Swede  or of  Muscovite  according to the land they inhabit and suffer their country to be severed like a common by the line on which those nations have traced their limits of empire  IT is not in the extremes alone that these varieties of genius may be clearly distinguished Their continual change keeps pace with the variations of climate with which we suppose them connected and though certain degrees of capacity penetration and ardour are not the lot of entire nations nor the vulgar properties of any  people yet their unequal frequency and unequal measure in different countries are sufficiently manifest from the manners the tone of conversation the talent for business amusement and literary composition which predominate in each  IT is to the Southern nations of Europe both ancient and modern that we owe the invention and the embellishment of that mythology and those early traditions which continue to furnish the materials of fancy and the field of poetic allusion To them we owe the romantic tales of chivalry as well as the subsequent models of a more rational style by which the heart and the imagination are kindled and the understanding informed  THE fruits of industry have abounded most in the North and the study of science has here received its most solid improvements the efforts of imagination and sentiment were most frequent and most successful in the South While the shores of the Baltic became famed for the studies of Copernicus Tycho Brahe and Kepler those of the Mediterranean were celebrated for giving birth to men of genius in all its variety and for having abounded with poets and historians as well as with men of science  ON one side learning took its rise from the heart and the fancy on the other it is still confined to the judgement and the memory A faithful detail of public transactions with little discernment of their comparative importance the treaties and the claims of nations the births and genealogies of princes are in the literature of  Northern nations amply preserved while the lights of the understanding and the feelings of the heart are suffered to perish The history of the human character the interesting memoir founded no less on the careless proceedings of a private life than on the formal transactions of a public station the ingenious pleasantry the piercing ridicule the tender pathetic or the elevated strain of elocution have been confined in modern as well as ancient times with a few exceptions to the same latitudes with the fig and the vine  THESE diversities of natural genius if real must have great part of their foundation in the animal frame and it has been often observed that the vine flourishes where to quicken the ferments of the human blood its aids are the least required While spiritous liquors are among Southern nations from a sense of their ruinous effects prohibited or from a love of decency and the possession of a temperament sufficiently warm not greatly desired they carry in the North a peculiar charm while they awaken the mind and give a taste of that lively fancy and ardour of passion which the climate is found to deny  THE melting desires or the fiery passions which in one climate take place between the sexes are in another changed into a sober consideration or a patience of mutual disgust This change is remarked in crossing the Mediterranean in following the course of the Missisippi in ascending the mountains of Caucasus and in passing from the Alps and the Pyrenees to the shores of the Baltic  THE female sex domineers on the frontier of Louisiana by the double engine of superstition and of passion They are slaves among the native inhabitants of Canada and chiefly valued for the toils they endure and the domestic service they yield  Charlevoix    THE burning ardours and the torturing jealousies of the seraglio and the haram which have reigned so long in Asia and Africa and which in the Southern parts of Europe have scarcely given way to the difference of religion and civil establishments are found however with an abatement of heat in the climate to be more easily changed in one latitude into a temporary passion which ingrosses the mind without enfeebling it and which excites to romantic atchievements by a farther progress to the North it is changed into a spirit of gallantry which employs the wit and the fancy more than the heart which prefers intrigue to enjoyment and substitutes affectation and vanity where sentiment and desire have failed As it departs from the sun the same passion is farther composed into a habit of domestic connection or frozen into a state of insensibility under which the sexes at freedom scarcely chuse to unite their society  THESE variations of temperament and character do not indeed correspond with the number  of degrees that are measured from the equator to the pole nor does the temperature of the air itself depend on the latitude Varieties of soil and position the distance or neighbourhood of the sea are known to affect the atmosphere and may have signal effects in composing the animal frame  THE climates of America though taken under the same parallel are observed to differ from those of Europe There extensive marshes great lakes aged decayed and crouded forests with the other circumstances that mark an uncultivated country are supposed to replenish the air with heavy and noxious vapours that give a double asperity to the winter and during many months by the frequency and continuance of fogs snow and frost carry the inconveniencies of the frigid zone far into the temperate The Samoiede and the Laplander however have their counterpart though on a lower latitude on the shores of America the Canadian and the Iroquois bear a resemblance to the ancient inhabitants of the middling climates of Europe the Mexican like the Asiatic of India being addicted to pleasure was sunk in effeminacy and in the neighbourhood of the wild and the free had suffered to be raised on his weakness a domineering superstition and a permanent fabric of despotical government  GREAT part of Tartary lies under the same parallels with Greece Italy and Spain but the climates are found to be different and while the shores not only of the Mediterranean but even those of the Atlantic are favoured with a moderate  change and vicissitude of seasons the eastern parts of Europe and the northern continent of Asia are afflicted with all their extremes In one season we are told that the plagues of an ardent summer reach almost to the frozen sea and that the inhabitant is obliged to screen himself from noxious vermin in the same clouds of smoke in which he must at a different time of the year take shelter from the rigours of cold When winter returns the transition is rapid and with an asperity almost equal in every latitude lays waste the face of the earth from the northern confines of Siberia to the descents of Mount Caucasus and the frontier of India  WITH this unequal distribution of climate by which the lot as well as the national character of the Northern Asiatic may be deemed inferior to that of Europeans who lie under the same parallels a similar gradation of temperament and spirit however has been observed in following the meridian on either tract and the Southern Tartar has over the Tonguses and the Samoiede the same preeminence that certain nations of Europe are known to possess over their Northern neighbours in situations more advantageous to both  THE Southern hemisphere scarcely offers a subject of like observation The temperate zone is there still undiscovered or is only known in two promontories the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn which stretch into moderate latitudes on that side of the line But the savage of South America notwithstanding the interposition of the nations of Peru and of Mexico is found to resemble  his counterpart on the North and the Hottentot in many things the barbarian of Europe he is tenacious of freedom has rudiments of policy and a national vigour which serve to distinguish his race from the other African tribes who are exposed to the more vertical rays of the sun  WHILE we have in these observations only thrown out what must present itself on the most cursory view of the history of mankind or what may be presumed from the mere obscurity of some nations who inhabit great tracts of the earth as well as from the lustre of others we are still unable to explain the manner in which climate may affect the temperament or foster the genius of its inhabitant  THAT the temper of the heart and the intellectual operations of the mind are in some measure dependent on the state of the animal organs is well known from experience Men differ from themselves in sickness and in health under a change of diet of air and of exercise but we are even in these familiar instances at a loss how to connect the cause with its supposed effect and though climate by including a variety of such causes may by someregular influence affect the characters of men we can never hope to explain the manner of those influences till we have understood what probably we shall never understand the structure of those finer organs with which the operations of the soul are connected  WHEN we point out in the situation of a people circumstances which by determining their pursuits regulate their habits and their manner of life and when instead of referring to the supposed physical source of their dispositions we assign their inducements to a determinate conduct in this we speak of effects and of causes whose connection is more familiarly known We can understand for instance why a race of men like the Samoiede confined during great part of the year to darkness or retired into caverns should differ in their manners and apprehensions from those who are at liberty in every season or who instead of seeking relief from the extremities of cold are employed in search of precautions against the oppressions of a burning sun Fire and exercise are the remedies of cold repose and shade the securities from heat The Hollander is laborious and industrious in Europe he becomes more languid and slothful in India  The Dutch sailors who were employed in the  of Malaco tore or burnt the sailcloth which was given them to make tents that they might not have the trouble of making or pitching them  Voy de Matelief    GREAT extremities either of heat or cold are perhaps in a moral view equally unfavourable to the active genius of mankind and by presenting alike insuperable difficulties to be overcome or strong inducements to indolence and sloth equally prevent the first applications of ingenuity or limit their progress Some intermediate degrees of inconvenience in the situation at once excite  the spirit and with the hopes of success encourage its efforts  It is in the least favourable situations  says Mr Rousseau  that arts have flourished the most I could show them in Egypt as they spread with the overflowing of the Nile and in Africa as they mounted up to the clouds and from a rocky soil and from barren sands while on the fertile banks of the Eurotas they were not able to fasten their roots  WHERE mankind from the first subsist by toil and in the midst of difficulties the defects of their situation are supplied by industry and while dry tempting and healthful lands are left uncultivated  Compare the state of Hungary with that of Holland  the pestilent marsh is drained with great labour and the sea is fenced off with mighty barriers the materials and the cost of which the soil to be gained can scarcely afford or repay Harbours are opened and crouded with shipping where vessels of burden if they are not constructed with a view to the situation have not water to float Elegant and magnificent edifices are raised on foundations of slime and all the conveniencies of human life are made to abound where nature does not seem to have prepared a reception of men It is in vain to expect that the residence of arts and commerce should be determined by the possession of natural advantages Men do more when they have certain difficulties to surmount than when they have supposed blessings to enjoy and the shade of the barren oak  and the pine are more favourable to the genius of mankind than that of the palm or the tamarind  AMONG the advantages which enable nations to run the carrier of policy as well as of arts it may be expected from the observations already made that we should reckon every circumstance which enables them to divide and to maintain themselves in distinct and in independent communities The society and concourse of other men are not more necessary to form the individual than the rivalship and competition of nations are to invigorate the principles of political life in a state Their wars and their treaties their mutual jealousies and the establishments which they devise with a view to each other constitute more than half the occupations of mankind and furnish materials for their greatest and most improving exertions For this reason clusters of islands a continent divided by many natural barriers great rivers ridges of mountains and arms of the sea are best fitted for becoming the nursery of independent and respectable nations The distinction of states being clearly maintained a principle of political life is established in every division and the capital of every district like the heart in an animal body communicates with ease the vital blood and the national spirit to its members  THE most respectable nations have always been found where at least one part of the frontier has been washed by the sea This barrier perhaps the strongest of all in the times of barbarity does not however even then supersede the cares of a national defence and in the advanced  state of arts gives the greatest soope and facility to commerce  THRIVING and independent nations were accordingly scattered on the shores of the Pacific and the Atlantic They surrounded the Red sea the Mediterranean and the Baltic while a few tribes excepted who retired among the mountains bordering on India and Persia or who have found some rude establishment among the creeks and the shores of the Caspian and the Euxine there is scarcely a people in the vast continent of Asia who deserves the name of a nation The unbounded plain is traversed at large by hordes who are in perpetual motion or who are displaced and harrassed by their mutual hostilities Although they are never perhaps actually blended together in the course of hunting or in the search of pasture they cannot bear one great distinction of nations which is taken from the territory and which is deeply impressed by an affection to the native seat They move in troops without the arrangement or the concert of nations they become easy accessions to every new empire among themselves or to the Chinese and the Muscovite with whom they hold a traffic for the means of subsistence and the materials of pleasure  WHERE a happy system of nations is formed they do not rely for the continuance of their separate names and for that of their political independence on the barriers erected by nature Mutual jealousies lead to the maintenance of a balance of power and this principle more than the Rhine and the Ocean than the Alps and the Pyrenees in modern Europe more than the straits  of Thermopylae the mountains of Thrace or the bays of Salamine and Corinth in ancient Greece tended to prolong the separation to which the inhabitants of these happy climates have owed their felicity as nations the lustre of their fame and their civil accomplishments  IF we mean to pursue the history of civil society our attention must be chiefly directed to such examples and we must here bid farewel to those regions of the earth on which our species by the effects of situation or climate appear to be restrained in their national pursuits or inferior in the powers of the mind  SECT II  The History of Subordination  WE have hitherto observed mankind either united together on terms of equality or disposed to admit of a subordination founded merely on the voluntary respect and attachment which they paid to their leaders but in both cases without any concerted plan of government or system of laws  THE savage whose fortune is comprised in his cabin his fur and his arms is satisfied with that provision and with that degree of security he himself can procure He perceives in treating with his equal no subject of discussion that should be referred to the decision of a judge nor does he find in any hand the badges of magistracy or the ensigns of a perpetual command  THE barbarian though induced by his admiration of personal qualities the lustre of a heroic race or a superiority of fortune to follow the banners of a leader and to act a subordinate part in his tribe knows not that what he performs from choice is to be made a subject of obligation He acts from affections unacquainted with forms and when provoked or when engaged in disputes  he recurs to the sword as the ultimate means of decision in all questions of right  HUMAN affairs in the mean time continue their progress What was in one generation a propensity to herd with the species becomes in the ages which follow a principle of national union What was originally an alliance for common defence becomes a concerted plan of political sorce the care of subsistence becomes an anxiety for accumulating wealth and the foundation of commercial arts  MANKIND in following the present sense of their minds in striving to remove inconveniencies or to gain apparent and contiguous advantages arrive at ends which even their imagination could not anticipate and pass on like other animals in the track of their nature without perceiving its end He who first said  I will appropriate this field I will leave it to my heirs  did not perceive that he was laying the foundation of civil laws and political establishments He who first ranged himself under a leader did not perceive that he was setting the example of a permanent subordination under the pretence of which the rapacious were to seize his possessions and the arrogant to lay claim to his service  MEN in general are sufficiently disposed to occupy themselves in forming projects and schemes but he who would scheme and project for others will find an opponent in every person who is disposed to scheme for himself Like the winds that come we know not whence and blow whithersoever they list the forms of society are derived  from an obscure and distant origin they arise long before the date of philosophy from the instincts not from the speculations of men The croud of mankind are directed in their establishments and measures by the circumstances in which they are placed and seldom are turned from their way to follow the plan of any single projector  EVERY step and every movement of the multitude even in what are termed enlightened ages are made with equal blindness to the future and nations stumble upon establishments which are indeed the result of human action but not the execution of any human design  De Retz Memoirs  If Cromwell said That a man never mounts higher than when he knows not whither he is going it may with more reason be affirmed of communities that they admit of the greatest revolutions where no change is intended and that the most refined politicians do not always know whither they are leading the state by their projects  IF we listen to the testimony of modern history and to that of the most authentic parts of the ancient if we attend to the practice of nations in every quarter of the world and in every condition whether that of the barbarian or the polished we shall find very little reason to retract this assertion No constitution is formed by concert no government is copied from a plan The members of a small state contend for equality the members of a greater find themselves classed in  a certain manner that lays a foundation for monarchy They proceed from one form of government to another by easy transitions and frequently under old names adopt a new constitution The seeds of every form are lodged in human nature they spring up and ripen with the season The prevalence of a particular species is often derived from an imperceptible ingredient mingled in the soil  WE are therefore to receive with caution the traditionary histories of ancient legislators and founders of states Their names have long been celebrated their supposed plans have been admired and what were probably the consequences of an early situation is in every instance considered as an effect of design An author and a work like cause and effect are perpetually coupled together This is the simplest form under which we can consider the establishment of nations and we ascribe to a previous design what came to be known only by experience what no human wisdom could foresee and what without the concurring humour and disposition of his age no authority could enable an individual to execute  IF men during ages of extensive reflection and employed in the search of improvement are wedded to their institutions and labouring under many acknowledged inconveniencies cannot break loose from the trammels of custom what shall we suppose their humour to have been in the times of Romulus and Lycurgus They were not surely more disposed to embrace the schemes of innovators or to shake off the impressions of habit they were not more pliant and ductile when their  knowledge was less not more capable of refinement when their minds were more circumscribed  WE imagine perhaps that rude nations must have so strong a sense of the defects under which they labour and be so conscious that reformations are requisire in their manners that they must be ready to adopt with joy every plan of improvement and to receive every plausible proposal with implicit compliance And we are thus inclined to believe that the harp of Orpheus could effect in one age what the eloquence of Plato could not produce in another We mistake however the characteristic of simple ages mankind then appear to feel the fewest defects and are then least desirous to enter on reformations  THE reality in the mean time of certain establishments at Rome and at Sparta cannot be disputed but it is probable that the government of both these states took its rise from the situation and genius of the people not from the projects of single men that the celebrated warrior and statesman who are considered as the founders of those nations only acted a superior part among numbers who were disposed to the same institutions and that they left to posterity a renown pointing them out as the inventors of many practices which had been already in use and which helped to form their own manners and genius as well as those of their countrymen  IT has been formerly observed that in many particulars the customs of simple nations coincide with what is ascribed to the invention of early  statesmen that the model of republican government the senate and the assembly of the people that even the equality of property or the community of goods were not reserved to the invention or contrivance of singular men  IF we consider Romulus as the founder of the Roman state certainly he who killed his brother that he might reign alone did not desire to come under restraints from the controuling power of the senate nor to refer the councils of his sovereignty to the decision of a collective body Love of dominion is by its nature averse to constraint and this chieftain like every leader in a rude age probably found a class of men ready to intrude on his councils and without whom he could not proceed He met with occasions on which as at the sound of a trumpet the body of the people assembled and took resolutions which any individual might in vain dispute or attempt to controul and Rome which commenced on the general plan of every artless society found lasting improvements in the pursuit of temporary expedients and digested her political frame in adjusting the pretensions of parties which arose in the state  MANKIND in very early ages of society learn to covet riches and to admire distinction they have avarice and ambition and are occasionally led by them to depredation and conquest but in their ordinary conduct these motives are balanced or restrained by other habits and other pursuits by sloth or intemperance by personal attachments or personal animosities which mislead from the attention to interest These circumstances  render mankind at times remiss or outrageous they prove the source of civil peace or disorder but disqualify those who are actuated by them from maintaining any fixed usurpation slavery and rapine are first threatened from abroad and war either offensive or defensive is the great business of every tribe The enemy occupy their thoughts they have no leisure for domestic dissensions It is the desire of every separate community however to secure itself and in proportion as it gains this object by strengthening its barrier by weakening its enemy or by procuring allies the individual at home bethinks him of what he may gain or lose for himself the leader is disposed to enlarge the advantages which belong to his station the follower becomes jealous of rights which are open to incroachment and parties who united before from affection and habit or from a regard to their common preservation disagree in supporting their several claims to prececedence or profit  WHEN the animosities of faction are thus awakened at home and the pretensions of freedom are opposed to those of dominion the members of every society find a new scene upon which to exert their activity They had quarrelled perhaps on points of interest they had balanced between different leaders but they had never united as citizens to withstand the encroachments of sovereignty or to maintain their common rights as a people If the prince in this contest finds numbers to support as well as to oppose his pretensions the sword which was whetted against foreign enemies may be pointed at the bosom of fellowsubjects and every interval of peace from abroad  be filled with domestic war The sacred names of Liberty Justice and Civil Order are made to resound in public assemblies and during the absence of other alarms give to society within itself an abundant subject of ferment and animosity  IF what is related of the little principalities which in ancient times were formed in Greece in Italy and over all Europe agrees with the character we have given of mankind under the first impressions of property of interest and of hereditary distinctions the seditions and domestic wars which followed in those very states the expulsion of their kings or the questions which arose concerning the prerogatives of the sovereign or privilege of the subject are agreeable to the representation which we now give of the first step toward political establishment and the desire of a legal constitution  WHAT this constitution may be in its earliest form depends on a variety of circumstances in the condition of nations It depends on the extent of the principality in its rude state on the degree of disparity to which mankind had submitted before they began to dispute its abuses it depends likewise on what we term  accidents  the personal character of an individual or the events of a war  EVERY community is originally a small one That propensity by which mankind at first unite is not the principle from which they afterwards act in extending the limits of empire Small tribes where they are not assembled by common objects  of conquest or safety are even averse to a coalition If like the real or fabulous confederacy of the Greeks for the destruction of Troy many nations combine in pursuit of a single object they easily separate again and act anew on the maxims of rival states  THERE is perhaps a certain national extent within which the passions of men are easily communicated from one or a few to the whole and there are certain numbers of men who can be assembled and act in a body If while the society is not enlarged beyond this dimension and while its members are easily assembled political contentions arise the state seldom fails to proceed on republican maxims and to establish democracy In most rude principalities the leader derived his prerogative from the lustre of his race and from the voluntary attachment of his tribe the people he commanded were his friends his subjects and his troops If we suppose upon any change in their manners that they cease to revere his dignity that they pretend to equality among themselves or are seized with a jealousy of his assuming too much the foundations of his power are already withdrawn When the voluntary subject becomes refractory when considerable parties or the collective body chuse to act for themselves the small kingdom like that of Athens becomes of course a republic  THE changes of condition and of manners which in the progress of mankind raise up to nations a leader and a prince create at the same time a nobility and a variety of ranks who have in a subordinate degree their claim to distinction  Superstition too may create an order of men who under the title of priesthood engage in the pursuit of a separate interest who by their union and firmness as a body and by their incessant ambition deserve to be reckoned in the list of pretenders to power These different orders of men are the elements of whose mixture the political body is generally formed each draws to its side some part from the mass of the people The people themselves are a party upon occasion and numbers of men however classed and distinguished become by their jarring pretensions and separate views mutual interruptions and checks and have by bringing to the national councils the maxims and apprehensions of a particular order and by guarding a particular interest a share in adjusting or preserving the political form of the state  THE pretensions of any particular order if not checked by some collateral power would terminate in tyranny those of a prince in despotism those of a nobility or priesthood in the abuses of aristocracy of a populace in the confusions of anarchy These terminations as they are never the professed so are they seldom even the disguised object of party but the measures which any party pursues if suffered to prevail will lead by degrees to every extreme  IN their way to the ascendant they endeavour to gain and in the midst of interruptions which opposite interests mutually give liberty may have a permanent or a transient existence and the constitution may bear a form and a character as various  as the casual combination of such multiplied parts can effect  TO bestow on communities some degree of political freedom it is perhaps sufficient that their members either singly or as they are involved with their several orders should insist on their rights that under republics the citizen should either maintain his own equality with firmness or restrain the ambition of his fellowcitizen within moderate bounds that under monarchy men of every rank should maintain the honours of their private or their public stations and sacrifice neither to the impositions of a court nor to the claims of a populace those dignities which are destined in some measure independent of fortune to give stability to the throne and to procure a respect to the subject  AMIDST the contentions of party the interests of the public even the maxims of justice and candour are sometimes forgotten and yet those fatal consequences which such a measure of corruption seems to portend do not unavoidably follow The public interest is often secure not because individuals are disposed to regard it as the end of their conduct but because each in his place is determined to preserve his own Liberty is maintained by the continued differences and oppositions of numbers not by their concurring zeal in behalf of equitable government In free states therefore the wisest laws are never perhaps dictated by the interest and spirit of any order of men they are moved they are opposed or amended by different hands and come at last to express  that medium and composition which contending parties have forced one another to adopt  WHEN we consider the history of mankind in this view we cannot be at a loss for the causes which in small communities threw the balance on the side of democracy which in states more enlarged in respect to territory and numbers of people gave the ascendant to monarchy and which in a variety of conditions and of different ages enabled mankind to blend and unite the characters of different forms and instead of any of the simple constitutions we have mentioned  Part sect  to exhibit a medly of all  IN emerging from a state of rudeness and simplicity men must be expected to act from that spirit of equality or moderate subordination to which they have been accustomed When crouded together in cities or within the compass of a small territory they act by contagious passions and every individual feels a degree of importance proportioned to his figure in the croud and the smallness of its numbers The pretenders to power and dominion appear in too familiar a light to impose upon the multitude and they have no aids at their call by which they can bridle the refractory humours of a people who resist their pretensions Theseus King of Attica we are told assembled the inhabitants of its twelve cantons into one city In this he took an effectual method to unite into one democracy what were before the separate members of his monarchy and to hasten the downfal of the regal power  THE monarch of an extensive territory has many advantages in maintaining his station Without any grievance to his subjects he can support the magnificence of a royal estate and dazzle the imagination of his people by that very wealth which themselves have bestowed He can employ the inhabitants of one district against those of another and while the passions that lead to mutiny and rebellion can at any one time seize only on a part of his subjects he feels himself strong in the possession of a general authority Even the distance at which he resides from many of those who receive his commands augments the mysterious awe and respect which are paid to his government  WITH these different tendencies accident and corruption however joined to a variety of circumstances may throw particular states from their bias and produce exceptions to every general rule This has actually happened in some of the later principalities of Greece and modern Italy in Sweden Poland and the German empire But the united states of the Netherlands and the Swiss cantons are perhaps the most extensive communities which maintaining the union of nations have for any considerable time resisted the tendency to monarchical government and Sweden is the only instance of a republic established in a great kingdom on the ruins of monarchy  THE sovereign of a petty district or a single city when not supported as in modern Europe by the contagion of monarchical manners holds the sceptre by a precarious tenure and is perpetually  alarmed by the spirit of mutiny in his people is guided by jealousy and supports himself by severity prevention and force  THE popular and aristocratical powers in a great nation as in the case of Germany and Poland may meet with equal difficulty in maintaining their pretensions and in order to avoid their danger on the side of kingly usurpation are obliged to withhold from the supreme magistrate even the necessary trust of an executive power  THE states of Europe in the manner of their first settlement laid the foundations of monarchy and were prepared to unite under regular and extensive governments If the Greeks whose progress at home terminated in the establishment of so many independent republics had under Agamemnon effected a conquest and settlement in Asia it is propable that they might have furnished an example of the same kind But the original inhabitants of any country forming many separate cantons come by slow degrees to that coalition and union into which conquering tribes are in effecting their conquests or in securing their possessions hurried at once Caesar encountered some hundreds of independent nations in Gaul whom even their common danger did not sufficiently unite The German invaders who settled in the lands of the Romans made in the same district a number of separate establishments but far more extensive than what the ancient Gauls by their conjunctions and treaties or in the result of their wars could after many ages have reached  THE seeds of great monarchies and the roots of extensive dominion were every where planted with the colonies that divided the Roman empire We have no exact account of the numbers who with a seeming concert continued during some ages to invade and to seize this tempting prize Where they expected resistance they endeavoured to muster up a proportionable force and when they proposed to settle entire nations removed to share in the spoil Scattered over an extensive province where they could not be secure without maintaining their union they continued to acknowledge the leader under whom they had fought and like an army sent by divisions into separate stations were prepared to assemble whenever occasion should require their united operations or counsels  EVERY separate party had its post assigned and every subordinate chieftain his possessions from which he was to provide his own subsistence and that of his followers The model of government was taken from that of a military subordination and a fief was the temporary pay of an officer proportioned to his rank  See Dr Robertson's History of Scotland b  There was a class of the people destined to military service another to labour and to cultivate lands for the benefit of their masters The officer improved his tenure by degrees first changing a temporary grant into a tenure for his life and this also upon the observance of certain conditions into a grant including his heirs  THE rank of the nobles became hereditary in every quarter and formed a powerful and permanent order of men in every state While they held the people in servitude they disputed the claims of their sovereign they withdrew their attendance upon occasion or turned their arms against him They formed a strong and insurmountable barrier against a general despotism in the state but they were themselves by means of their warlike retainers the tyrants of every little district and prevented the establishment of order or any regular applications of law They took the advantage of weak reigns or minorities to push their incroachments on the sovereign or having made the monarchy elective they by successive treaties and stipulations at every election limited or undermined the monarchical power The prerogatives of the prince have been in some instances as in that of the German empire in particular reduced to a mere title and the national union itself preserved in the observance only of a few insignificant formalities  WHERE the contest of the sovereign and of his vassals under hereditary and ample prerogatives annexed to the crown had a different issue the feudal lordships were gradually stript of their powers the nobles were reduced to the state of subjects and obliged to hold their honours and exercise their jurisdictions in a dependence on the prince It was his supposed interest to reduce them to a state of equal subjection with the people and to extend his own authority by rescuing the labourer and the dependent from the oppressions of their immediate superiors  IN this project the princes of Europe have variously succeeded While they protected the people and thereby encouraged the practice of commercial and lucrative arts they paved the way for despotism in the state and with the same policy by which they relieved the subject from many oppressions they increased the powers of the crown  BUT where the people had by the constitution a representative in the government and a head under which they could avail themselves of the wealth they acquired and of the sense of their personal importance this policy turned against the crown it formed a new power to restrain the prerogative to establish the government of law and to exhibit a spectacle new in the history of mankind monarchy mixed with republic and extensive territory governed during some ages without military force  SUCH were the steps by which the nations of Europe have arrived at their present establishments in some instances they have come to the possession of legal constitutions in others to the exercise of a mitigated despotism or continue to struggle with the tendency which they severally have to these different extremes  THE progress of empire in the early ages of Europe threatened to be rapid and to bury the independent spirit of nations in that grave which the Ottoman conquerors found for themselves and for the wretched race they had vanquished The Romans were led by slow degrees to extend the limits of their empire every new acquisition  was the result of a tedious war and required the sending of colonies and a variety of measures to secure any new possession But the feudal superior being animated from the moment he had gained an establishment with a desire of extending his territory and of enlarging the list of his vassals made frequent annexation of new provinces merely by bestowing investiture and received independent states without any material innovation in the form of their policy as the subjects of his growing dominion  SEPARATE principalities were like the parts of an engine ready to be joined and like the materials of a building ready to be erected They were in the result of their struggles put together or taken asunder with facility The independence of weak states was preserved only by the mutual jealousies of the strong or by the general attention of all to maintain a balance of power  THE happy system of policy on which European states have proceeded in preserving this balance the degree of moderation which is in adjusting their treaties become habitual even to victorious and powerful monarchies does honour to mankind and may give hopes of a lasting felicity to be derived from a prepossession never perhaps equally strong in any former period or among any number of nations that the first conquering people will ruin themselves as well as their rivals  IT is in such states perhaps as in a fabric of a large dimension that we can perceive most distinctly the several parts of which a political  body consists and observe that concurrence or opposition of interests which serve to unite or to separate different orders of men and lead them by maintaining their several claims to establish a variety of political forms The smallest republics however consist of parts similar to these and of members who are actuated by a similar spirit They furnish examples of government diversified by the casual combinations of parties and by the different advantages with which those parties engage in the conflict  IN every society there is a casual subordination independent of its formal establishment and frequently adverse to its constitution While the administration and the people speak the language of a particular form and seem to admit no pretensions to power without a legal nomination in one instance or without the advantage of hereditary honours in another this casual subordination possibly arising from the distribution of property or from some other circumstance that bestows unequal degrees of influence gives the state its tone and fixes its character  THE plebeian order at Rome having been long considered as of an inferior condition and excluded from the higher offices of magistracy had sufficient force as a body to get this invidious distinction removed but the individual still acting under the impressions of a subordinate rank gave in every competition his suffrage to a patrician whose protection he had experienced and whose personal authority he felt By this means the ascendency of the patrician families was for a certain period as regular as it could be made by the avowed maxims of aristocracy  but the higher offices of state being gradually shared by plebeians the effects of former distinctions were prevented or weakened The laws that were made to adjust the pretensions of different orders were easily eluded The populace became a faction and their alliance was the surest road to dominion Clodius by a pretended adoption into a plebeian family was qualified to become tribune of the people and Caesar by espousing the cause of this faction made his way to usurpation and tyranny  IN such fleeting and transient scenes forms of government are only modes of proceeding in which every subsequent age may differ from the former Faction is ever ready to seize all occasional advantages and mankind when in hazard from any party seldom find a better protection than that of its rival Cato united with Pompey in opposition to Caesar and guarded against nothing so much as that reconciliation of parties which was in effect to be a combination of different leaders against the freedom of the republic This illustrious personage stood distinguished in his age like a man among children and was raised above his opponents as much by the justness of his understanding and the extent of his penetration as he was by the manly fortitude and disinterestedness with which he strove to baffle the designs of a vain and childish ambition that was operating to the ruin of mankind  ALTHOUGH free constitutions of government seldom or never take their rise from the scheme of any single projector yet are they often preserved by the vigilance activity and zeal of single men Happy are they who understand and who chuse this  object of care and happy it is for mankind when it is not chosen too late It has been reserved to signalize the lives of a Cato or a Brutus on the eve of fatal revolutions to foster in secret the indignation of Thrasea and Helvidius and to occupy the reflections of speculative men in times of corruption But even in such late and ineffectual examples it was happy to know and to value an object which is so important to mankind The pursuit and the love of it however unsuccessful has thrown a lustre on human nature  SECT III  Of National Objects in general and of Establishments and Manners relating to them  WHILE the mode of subordination is casual and forms of government take their rise chiefly from the manner in which the members of a state have been originally classed and from a variety of circumstances that procure to particular orders of men a sway in their country there are certain objects that claim the attention of every government that lead the apprehensions and the reasonings of mankind in every society and that not only furnish an employment to statesmen but in some measure direct the community to those institutions under the authority of which the magistrate holds his power Such are the national defence the distribution of justice the preservation and internal prosperity of the state If these objects be neglected we must apprehend that the very scene in which parties contend for power for privilege or equality must disappear and society itself no longer exist  THE consideration due to these objects will be pleaded in every public assembly and will produce in every political contest appeals to that common sense and opinion of mankind which struggling with the private views of individuals and the claims of party may be considered as the great legislator of nations  THE measures required for the attainment of most national objects are connected together and must be jointly pursued they are often the same The force which is prepared for defence against foreign enemies may be likewise employed to keep the peace at home the laws made to secure the rights and liberties of the people may serve as encouragements to population and commerce and every community without considering how its objects may be classed or distinguished by speculative men is in every instance obliged to assume or to retain that form which is best fitted to preserve its advantages or to avert its misfortunes  NATIONS however like private men have their favourite ends and their principal pursuits which diversify their manners as well as their establishments They even attain to the same ends by different means and like men who make their fortune by different professions retain the habits of their principal calling in every condition at which they arrive The Romans became wealthy in pursuing their conquests and probably for a certain period increased the numbers of mankind while their disposition to war seemed to threaten the earth with desolation Some modern nations proceed to dominion and enlargement on the maxims of commerce and while they only intend to accumulate riches at home continue to gain an imperial ascendant abroad  THE characters of the warlike and the commercial are variously combined they are formed in different degrees by the influence of circumstances  that more or less frequently give rise to war and excite the desire of conquest of circumstances that leave a people in quiet to improve their domestic resources or to purchase by the fruits of their industry from foreigners what their own soil and their climate deny  THE members of every community are more or less occupied with matters of state in proportion as their constitution admits them to a share in the government and summons up their attention to objects of a public nature A people are cultivated or unimproved in their talents in proportion as those talents are employed in the practice of arts and in the affairs of society they are improved or corrupted in their manners in proportion as they are encouraged and directed to act on the maxims of freedom and justice or as they are degraded into a state of meanness and servitude But whatever advantages are obtained or whatever evils are avoided by nations in any of these important respects are generally considered as mere occasional incidents they are seldom admitted among the objects of policy or entered among the reasons of state  WE hazard being treated with ridicule when we require political establishments merely to cultivate the talents of men and to inspire the sentiments of a liberal mind we must offer some motive of interest or some hopes of external advantage to animate the pursuits or to direct the measures of ordinary men They would be brave ingenious and eloquent only from necessity or for the sake of profit they magnify the  uses of wealth population and the other resources of war but often forget that these are of no consequence without the direction of able capacities and without the supports of a national vigour We may expect therefore to find among states the bias to a particular policy taken from the regards to public safety from the desire of securing personal freedom or private property seldom from the consideration of moral effects or from a view to the genius of mankind  SECT IV  Of Population and Wealth  WHEN we imagine what the Romans must have felt when the tidings came that the flower of their city had perished at Cannae when we think of what the orator had in his mind when he said  That the youth among the people was like the spring among the seasons  when we hear of the joy with which the huntsman and the warrior is adopted in America to sustain the honours of the family and the nation we are made to feel the most powerful motives to regard the increase and preservation of our fellowcitizens Interest affection and views of policy combine to recommend this object and it is treated with entire neglect only by the tyrant who mistakes his own advantage by the statesman who trifles with the charge committed to his care or by the people who are become corrupted and who consider their fellowsubjects as rivals in interest and competitors in their lucrative pursuits  AMONG rude societies and among small communities in general who are engaged in frequent struggles and difficulties the preservation and increase of their members is a most important object The American rates his defeat from the numbers of men he has lost or he estimates his victory from the prisoners he has made not from his having remained the master of a field or from  his being driven from a ground on which he encountered his enemy A man with whom he can associate in all his pursuits whom he can embrace as his friend in whom he finds an object to his affections and an aid in his struggles is to him the most precious accession of fortune  EVEN where the friendship of particular men is out of the question the society being occupied in forming a party that may defend itself and annoy its enemy finds no object of greater moment than the increase of its numbers Captives who may be adopted or children of either sex who may be reared for the public are accordingly considered as the richest spoil of an enemy The practice of the Romans in admitting the vanquished to share in the privileges of their city the rape of the Sabines and the subsequent coalition with that people were not singular or uncommon examples in the history of mankind The same policy has been followed and was natural and obvious whereever the strength of a state consisted in the arms of a few and where men were valued in themselves distinct from the consideration of estate or of fortune  IN rude ages therefore while mankind subsist in small divisions it should appear that if the earth be thinly peopled this defect does not arise from a disregard to numbers on the part of states It is even probable that the most effectual course that could be taken to increase the species would be to prevent the coalition of nations and to oblige mankind to act in such small bodies as would make the preservation of their numbers a principal object of their care This alone it is  true would not be sufficient we must probably add the encouragement for rearing families which mankind enjoy under a favourable policy and the means of subsistence which they owe to the practice of arts  THE mother is unwilling to increase her offspring and is ill provided to rear them where she herself is obliged to undergo great hardships in the search of her food In North America we are told that she joins to the reserves of a cold or a moderate temperament the abstinencies to which she submits from the consideration of this difficulty In her apprehension it is matter of prudence and of conscience to bring one child to the condition of feeding on venison and of following on foot before she will hazard a new burden in travelling the woods  IN warmer latitudes by the different temperament perhaps which the climate bestows and by a greater facility in procuring subsistence the numbers of mankind increase while the object itself is neglected and the commerce of the sexes without any concern for population is made a subject of mere debauch In some places we are told it is even made the object of a barbarous policy to defeat or to restrain the intentions of nature In the island of Formosa the males are prohibited to marry before the age of forty and females if pregnant before the age of thirtysix have an abortion procured by order of the magistrate who employs a violence that endangers the life of the mother together with that of the child  Collection of Dutch voyages    IN China the permission given to parents to kill or to expose their children was probably meant as a relief from the burden of a numerous offspring But notwithstanding what we hear of a practice so repugnant to the human heart it has not probably the effects in restraining population which it seems to threaten but like many other institutions has an influence the reverse of what it seemed to portend The parents marry with this means of relief in their view and the children are saved  HOWEVER important the object of population may be held by mankind it will be difficult to find in the history of civil policy any wise or effectual establishments solely calculated to obtain it The practice of rude or feeble nations is inadequate or cannot surmount the obstacles which are found in their manner of life The growth of industry the endeavours of men to improve their arts to extend their commerce to secure their possessions and to establish their rights are indeed the most effectual means to promote population but they arise from a different motive they arise from regards to interest and personal safety They are intended for the benefit of those who exist not to procure the increase of their numbers  IT is in the mean time of importance to know that where a people are fortunate in their political establishments and successful in the pursuits of industry their population is likely to grow in proportion Most of the other devices thought of for this purpose only serve to frustrate the  expectations of mankind or to mislead their attention  IN planting a colony in striving to repair the occasional wastes of pestilence or war the immediate contrivance of statesmen may be useful but if in reasoning on the increase of mankind in general we overlook their freedom and their happiness our aids to population become weak and ineffectual They only lead us to work on the surface or to pursue a shadow while we neglect the substantial concern and in a decaying state make us tamper with palliatives while the roots of an evil are suffered to remain Octavius revived or inforced the laws that related to population at Rome but it may be said of him and of many sovereigns in a similar situation that they administer the poison while they are devising the remedy and bring a damp and a palsy on the principles of life while they endeavour by external applications to the skin to restore the bloom of a decayed and a sickly body  IT is indeed happy for mankind that this important object is not always dependent on the wisdom of sovereigns or the policy of single men A people intent on freedom find for themselves a condition in which they may follow the propensities of nature with a more signal effect than any which the councils of state could devise When sovereigns or projectors are the supposed masters of this subject the best they can do is to be cautious of hurting an interest they cannot greatly promote and of making breaches they cannot repair  When nations were divided into small territories and petty commonwealths where each man had his house and his field to himself and each county had its capital free and independent what a happy situation for mankind  says Mr Hume  how favourable to industry and agriculture to marriage and to population  Yet here were probably no schemes of the statesman for rewarding the married or for punishing the single for inviting foreigners to settle or for prohibiting the departure of natives Every citizen finding a possession secure and a provision for his heirs was not discouraged by the gloomy fears of oppression or want and where every other function of nature was free that which furnished the nursery could not be restrained Nature has required the powerful to be just but she has not otherwise intrusted the preservation of her works to their visionary plans What fewel can the statesman add to the fires of youth Let him only not smother it and the effect is secure Where we oppress or degrade mankind with one hand it is vain like Octavius to hold out in the other the baits of marriage or the whip to barrenness It is vain to invite new inhabitants from abroad while those we already possess are made to hold their tenure with uncertainty and to tremble not only under the prospect of a numerous family but even under that of a precarious and doubtful subsistence for themselves The arbitrary sovereign who has made this the condition of his subjects owes the remains of his people to the powerful instincts of nature not to any device of his own  MEN will croud where the situation is tempting and in a few generations will people every country to the measure of its means of subsistence They will even increase under circumstances that portend a decay The frequent wars of the Romans and of many a thriving community even the pestilence and the market for slaves find their supply if without destroying the source the drain become regular and if an issue is made for the offspring without unsettling the families from which they arise Where a happier provision is made for mankind the statesman who by premiums to marriage by allurements to foreigners or by confining the natives at home apprehends that he has made the numbers of his people to grow is often like the fly in the fable who admired its success in turning the wheel and in moving the carriage he has only accompanied what was already in motion he has dashed with his oar to hasten the cataract and waved with his fan to give speed to the winds  PROJECTS of mighty settlement and of sudden population however successful in the end are always expensive to mankind Above a hundred thousand peasants we are told were yearly driven like so many cattle to Petersburgh in the first attempts to replenish that settlement and yearly perished for want of subsistence  Strachlenberg  The Indian only attempts to settle in the neighbourhood of the plantain  Dampier  and while his family increases he adds a tree to the walk  IF the plantain the cocoa or the palm were sufficient to maintain an inhabitant the race of men in the warmer climates might become as numerous as the trees of the forest But in many parts of the earth from the nature of the climate and the soil the spontaneous produce being next to nothing the means of subsistence are the fruits only of labour and skill If a people while they retain their frugality increase their industry and improve their arts their numbers must grow in proportion Hence it is that the cultivated fields of Europe are more peopled than the wilds of America or the plains of Tartary  BUT even the increase of mankind which attends the accumulation of wealth has its limits The  necessary of life  is a vague and a relative term it is one thing in the opinion of the savage another in that of the polished citizen it has a reference to the fancy and to the habits of living While arts improve and riches increase while the possessions of individuals or their prospects of gain come up to their opinion of what is required to settle a family they enter on its cares with alacrity But when the possession however redundant falls short of the standard and a fortune supposed sufficient for marriage is attained with difficulty population is checked or begins to decline The citizen in his own apprehension returns to the state of the savage his children he thinks must perish for want and he quits a scene overflowing with plenty because he has not the fortune which his supposed rank or his wishes require No ultimate remedy is applied to this evil by merely accumulating wealth for rare and  costly materials whatever these are continue to be sought and if silks and pearl are made common men will begin to covet some new decorations which the wealthy alone can procure If they are indulged in their humour their demands are repeated For it is the continual increase of riches not any measure attained that keeps the craving imagination at ease  MEN are tempted to labour and to practise lucrative arts by motives of interest Secure to the workman the fruit of his labour give him the prospects of independence or freedom the public has found a faithful minister in the acquisition of wealth and a faithful steward in hoarding what he has gained The statesman in this as in the case of population itself can do little more than avoid doing mischief It is well if in the beginnings of commerce he knows how to repress the frauds to which it is subject Commerce if continued is the branch in which men committed to the effects of their own experience are least apt to go wrong  THE trader in rude ages is shortsighted fraudulent and mercenary but in the progress and advanced state of his art his views are enlarged his maxims are established he becomes punctual liberal faithful and enterprising and in the period of general corruption he alone has every virtue except the force to defend his acquisitions He needs no aid from the state but its protection and is often in himself its most intelligent and respectable member Even in China we are informed where pilfering fraud and corruption are the reigning practice with all  the other orders of men the great merchant is ready to give and to procure confidence while his countrymen act on the plans and under the restrictions of a police adjusted to knaves he acts on the reasons of trade and the maxims of mankind  IF population be connected with national wealth liberty and personal security is the great foundation of both and if this foundation be laid in the state nature has secured the increase and the industry of its members the one by desires the most ardent in the human frame the other by a consideration the most uniform and constant of any that possesses the mind The great object of policy therefore with respect to both is to secure to the family its means of subsistence and settlement to protect the industrious in the pursuit of his occupation to reconcile the restrictions of police and the social affections of mankind with their separate and interested pursuits  IN matters of particular profession industry and trade the experienced practitioner is the master and every general reasoner is a novice The object in commerce is to make the individual rich the more he gains for himself the more he augments the wealth of his country If a protection be required it must be granted if crimes and frauds be committed they must be repressed and government can pretend to no more When the refined politician would lend an active hand he only multiplies interruptions and grounds of complaint when the merchant forgets his own interest to lay plans for his country the period of vision and chimera is near and the solid basis of  commerce withdrawn He might be told perhaps that while he pursues his advantage and gives no cause of complaint the interest of commerce is safe  THE general police of France proceeding on a supposition that the exportation of corn must drain the country where it has grown had till of late laid that branch of commerce under a severe prohibition The English landholder and the farmer had credit enough to obtain a premium for exportation to favour the sale of their commodity and the event has shewn that private interest is a better patron of commerce and plenty than the refinements of state One nation lays the refined plan of a settlement on the continent of North America and trusts little to the conduct of traders and shortsighted men another leaves men to find their own position in a state of freedom and to think for themselves The active industry and the limited views of the one made a thriving settlement the great projects of the other were still in idea  BUT I willingly quit a subject in which I am not much conversant and still less engaged by the views with which I write Speculations on commerce and wealth have been delivered by the ablest writers who have left nothing so important to be offered on the subject as the general caution not to consider these articles as making the sum of national felicity or the principal object of any state  ONE nation in search of gold and of precious metals neglect the domestic sources of wealth  and become dependent on their neighbours for the necessaries of life another so intent on improving their internal resources and on increasing their commerce that they become dependent on foreigners for the defence of what they acquire It is even painful in conversation to find the interests of trade give the tone to our reasonings and to find a subject perpetually offered as the great business of national councils to which any interposition of government is seldom with propriety applied or never beyond the protection it affords  WE complain of a want of public spirit but whatever may be the effect of this error in practice in speculation it is none of our faults  we reason perpetually for the public but the want of national views were frequently better than the possession of those we express we would have nations like a company of merchants think of nothing but the increase of their stock assemble to deliberate on profit and loss and like them too intrust their protection to a force which they do not possess in themselves  BECAUSE men like other animals are maintained in multitudes where the necessaries of life are amassed and the store of wealth is enlarged we drop our regards for the happiness the moral and political character of a people and anxious for the herd we would propagate carry our views no farther than the stall and the pasture We forget that the few have often made a prey of the many that to the poor there is nothing so enticing as the coffers of the rich and that when the price of freedom comes to be paid the heavy  sword of the victor may fall into the opposite scale  WHATEVER be the actual conduct of nations in this matter it is certain that many of our arguments would hurry us for the sake of wealth and of population into a scene where mankind being exposed to corruption are unable to defend their possessions and where they are in the end subject to oppression and ruin We cut off the roots while we would extend the branches and thicken the foliage  IT is possibly from an opinion that the virtues of men are secure that some who turn their attention to public affairs think of nothing but the numbers and wealth of a people it is from a dread of corruption that others think of nothing but how to preserve the national virtues Human society has great obligations to both They are opposed to one another only by mistake and even when united have not strength sufficient to combat the wretched party that refers every object to personal interest and that cares not for the safety or increase of any stock but its own  SECT V  Of National Defence and Conquest  IT is impossible to ascertain how much of the policy of any state has a reference to war or to national safety  Our legislator  says the Cretan in Plato  thought that nations were by nature in a state of hostility he took his measures accordingly and observing that all the possessions of the vanquished pertain to the victor he held it ridiculous to propose any benefit to his country before he had provided that it should not be conquered  CRETE which is supposed to have been a model of military policy is commonly considered as the original from which the celebrated laws of Lycurgus were copied Mankind it seems in every instance must have some palpable object to direct their proceedings and must have a view to some point of external utility even in the choice of their virtues The discipline of Sparta was military and a sense of its use in the field more than the force of unwritten and traditionary laws or the supposed engagements of the public faith obtained by the lawgiver may have induced this people to persevere in the observance of many rules which to other nations do not appear necessary except in the presence of an enemy  EVERY institution of this singular people gave a lesson of obedience of fortitude and of zeal for the public but it is remarkable that they chose to obtain by their virtues alone what other nations are fain to buy with their treasure and it is well known that in the course of their history they came to regard their discipline merely on account of its moral effects They had experienced the happiness of a mind courageous disinterested and devoted to its best affections and they studied to preserve this character in themselves by resigning the interests of ambition and the hopes of military glory even by sacrificing the numbers of their people  IT was the fate of Spartans who escaped from the field not of those who perished with Cleombrotus at Leuctra that filled the cottages of Lacedemon with mourning and serious reflection  Xenophon  it was the fear of having their citizens corrupted abroad by intercourse with servile and mercenary men that made them quit the station of leaders in the Persian war and leave Athens during fifty years to pursue unrivalled that career of ambition and profit by which she made such acquisitions of power and of wealth  Thucydides book    WE have had occasion to observe that in every rude state the great business is war and that in barbarous times mankind being generally divided into small parties are engaged in almost  perpetual hostilities This circumstance gives the military leader a continued ascendant in his country and inclines every people during warlike ages to monarchical government  THE conduct of an army can least of all subjects be divided and we may be justly surprised to find that the Romans after many ages of military experience and after having recently felt the arms of Hannibal in many encounters associated two leaders at the head of the same army and left them to adjust their pretensions by taking the command each a day in his turn The same people however on other occasions thought it expedient to suspend the exercise of every subordinate magistracy and in the time of great alarms to intrust all the authority of the state in the hands of one person  REPUBLICS have generally found it necessary in the conduct of war to place great confidence in the executive branch of their government When a consul at Rome had proclaimed his levies and administered the military oath he became from that moment master of the public treasury and of the lives of those who were under his command  Polybius  The axe and the rods were no longer a mere badge of magistracy or an empty pageant in the hands of the lictor they were at the command of the father stained with the blood of his own children and fell without appeal on the mutinous and the disobedient of every condition  IN every free state there is a perpetual necessity to distinguish the maxims of martial law from those of the civil and he who has not learned to give an implicit obedience where the state has given him a military leader and to resign his personal freedom in the field from the same magnanimity with which he maintains it in the political deliberations of his country has yet to learn the most important lesson of civil society and is only fit to occupy a place in a rude or in a corrupted state where the principles of mutiny and of servility being joined the one or the other is frequently adopted in the wrong place  FROM a regard to what is necessary in war nations inclined to popular or aristocratical government have had recourse to establishments that bordered on monarchy Even where the highest office of the state was in common times administered by a plurality of persons the whole power and authority belonging to it was on particular occasions committed to one and upon great alarms when the political fabric was shaken or endangered a monarchical power has been applied like a prop to secure the state against the rage of the tempest Thus were the dictators occasionally named at Rome and the stadtholders in the United Provinces and thus in mixed governments the royal prerogative is occasionally enlarged by the temporary suspension of laws  In Britain by the suspension of the  Habeas corpus  and the barriers of liberty appear to be removed in order to vest a dictatorial power in the hands of the king  HAD mankind therefore no view but to warfare it is probable that they would continue to prefer monarchical government to any other or at least that every nation in order to procure secret and united councils would intrust the executive power with unlimited authority But happily for civil society men have objects of a different sort and experience has taught that although the conduct of armies requires an absolute and undivided command yet a national force is best formed where numbers of men are inured to equality and where the meanest citizen may consider himself upon occasion as destined to command as well as to obey It is here that the dictator finds a spirit and a force prepared to second his councils it is here too that the dictator himself is formed and that numbers of leaders are presented to the public choice it is here that the prosperity of a state is independent of single men and that a wisdom which never dies with a system of military arrangements permanent and regular can even under the greatest misfortunes prolong the national struggle With this advantage the Romans finding a number of distinguished leaders arise in succession were at all times almost equally prepared to contend with their enemies of Asia or Africa while the fortune of those enemies on the contrary depended on the casual appearance of singular men of a Mithridates or of a Hannibal  THE soldier we are told has his point of honour and a fashion of thinking which he wears with his sword This point of honour in free and uncorrupted states is a zeal for the public and  war to them is an operation of passions not the mere pursuit of a calling Its good and its ill effects are felt in extremes the friend is made to experience the warmest proofs of attachment the enemy the severest effects of animosity On this system the celebrated nations of antiquity made war under their highest attainments of civility and under their greatest degrees of refinement  IN small and rude societies the individual finds himself attacked in every national war and none can propose to devolve his defence on another  The King of Spain is a great prince  said an American chief to the governor of Jamaica who was preparing a body of troops to join in an enterprise against the Spaniards  do you propose to make war upon so great a king with so small a force  Being told that the forces he saw were to be joined by troops from Europe and that the governor could then command no more  Who are these then  said the American  who form this croud of spectators are they not your people and why do you not all go forth to so great a war  He was answered That the spectators were merchants and other inhabitants who took no part in the service  Would they be merchants still  continued this statesman  if the King of Spain was to attack you here For my part I do not think that merchants should be permitted to live in any country when I go to war I leave no body at home but the women  It should seem that this simple warrior considered merchants as a kind of neutral persons who took no part in the quarrels of their country and that he did not know how much  war itself may be made a subject of traffic what mighty armies may be put in motion from behind the counter how often human blood is without any national animosity bought and sold for bills of exchange and how often the prince the nobles and the statesmen in many a polished nation might in his account be considered as merchants  IN the progress of arts and of policy the members of every state are divided into classes and in the commencement of this distribution there is no distinction more serious than that of the warrior and the pacific inhabitant no more is required to place men in the relation of master and slave Even when the rigours of an established slavery abate as they have done in modern Europe in consequence of a protection and a property allowed to the mechanic and labourer this distinction serves still to separate the noble from the base and to point out that class of men who are destined to reign and to domineer in their country  IT was certainly never foreseen by mankind that in the pursuit of refinement they were to reverse this order or even that they were to place the government and the military force of nations in different hands But is it equally unforeseen that the former order may again take place and that the pacific citizen however distinguished by privilege and rank must one day bow to the person with whom he has intrusted his sword If such revolutions should actually follow will this new master revive in his own order the spirit of the noble and the free Will he renew the characters of the warrior and the statesman Will he  restore to his country the civil and military virtues I am afraid to reply Montesquieu observes that the government of Rome even under the emperors became in the hands of the troops elective and republican but the Fabii or the Bruti were heard of no more after the praetorian bands became the republic  WE have enumerated some of the heads under which a people as they emerge from barbarity may come to be classed Such are the nobility the people the adherents of the prince and even the priesthood have not been forgotten when we arrive at times of refinement the army must be joined to the list The departments of civil government and of war being severed and the preeminence being given to the statesman the ambitious will naturally devolve the military service on those who are contented with a subordinate station They who have the greatest share in the division of fortune and the greatest interest in defending their country having resigned the sword must pay for what they have ceased to perform and armies not only at a distance from home but in the very bosom of their country are subsisted by pay A discipline is invented to inure the soldier to perform from habit and from the fear of punishment those hazardous duties which the love of the public or national spirit no longer inspire  WHEN we consider the breach that such an establishment makes in the system of national virtues it is unpleasant to observe that most nations who have run the career of civil arts have in some degree adopted this measure Not only  states which either have wars to maintain or precarious possessions to defend at a distance not only a prince jealous of his authority or in haste to gain the advantage of discipline are disposed to employ foreign troops or to keep standing armies but even republics with little of the former occasion and none of the motives which prevail in monarchy have been found to tread in the same path  IF military arrangements occupy so considerable a place in the domestic policy of nations the actual consequences of war are equally important in the history of mankind Glory and spoil were the earliest subject of quarrels a concession of superiority or a ransom were the prices of peace The love of safety and the desire of dominion equally lead mankind to wish for accessions of strength Whether as victors or as vanquished they tend to a coalition and powerful nations considering a province or a fortress acquired on their frontier as so much gained are perpetually intent on extending their limits  THE maxims of conquest are not always to be distinguished from those of selfdefence If a neighbouring state be dangerous if it be frequently troublesome it is a maxim founded in the consideration of safety as well as of conquest That it ought to be weakened or disarmed If being once reduced it be disposed to renew the contest it must from thenceforward be governed in form Rome never avowed any other maxims of conquest and she every where sent her insolent armies under the specious pretence of procuring to herself and her allies a lasting peace which she alone would reserve the power to disturb  THE equality of those alliances which the Grecian states formed against each other maintained for a time their independence and separation and that time was the shining and the happy period of their story It was prolonged more by the vigilance and conduct which they severally applied than by the moderation of their councils or by any peculiarities of domestic policy which arrested their progress The victors were sometimes contented with merely changing to a resemblance of their own forms the government of the states they subdued What the next step might have been in the progress of impositions is hard to determine But when we consider that one party fought for the imposition of tributes another for the ascendant in war it cannot be doubted that the Athenians from a national ambition and from the desire of wealth and the Spartans though they originally only meant to defend themselves and their allies were both at last equally willing to become the masters of Greece and were preparing for each other at home that yoke which both together with their confederates were obliged to receive from abroad  IN the conquests of Philip the desire of selfpreservation and security seemed to be blended with the ambition natural to princes He turned his arms successively to the quarters on which he found himself hurt from which he had been alarmed or provoked and when he had subdued the Greeks he proposed to lead them against their ancient enemy of Persia In this he laid the plan which was carried into execution by his son  THE Romans become the masters of Italy and the conquerors of Carthage had been alarmed on the side of Macedon and were led to cross a new sea in search of a new field on which to exercise their military force In prosecution of their wars from the earliest to the latest date of their history without intending the very conquests they made perhaps without foreseeing what advantage they were to reap from the subjection of distant provinces or in what manner they were to govern their new acquisitions they still proceeded to seize what came successively within their reach and stimulated by a policy which engaged them in perpetual wars which led to perpetual victory and accessions of territory they extended the frontier of a state which but a few centuries before had been confined within the skirts of a village to the Euphrates the Danube the Weser the Forth and the ocean  IT is vain to affirm that the genius of any nation is adverse to conquest Its real interests indeed most commonly are so but every state which is prepared to defend itself and to obtain victories is likewise in hazard of being tempted to conquer  IN Europe where mercenary and disciplined armies are every where formed and ready to traverse the earth where like a flood pent up by slender banks they are only restrained by political forms or a temporary balance of power if the sluices should break what inundations may we not expect to behold Effeminate kingdoms and empires are spread from the sea of Corea to the Atlantic  ocean Every state by the defeat of its troops may be turned into a province every army opposed in the field today may be hired tomorrow and every victory gained may give the accession of a new military force to the victor  THE Romans with inferior arts of communication both by sea and land maintained their dominion in a considerable part of Europe Asia and Africa over fierce and intractable nations What may not the fleets and armies of Europe with the access they have by commerce to every part of the world and the facility of their conveyance effect if that ruinous maxim should prevail That the grandeur of a nation is to be estimated from the extent of its territory or That the interest of any particular people consists in reducing their neighbours to servitude  SECT VI  Of Civil Liberty  IF war either for depredation or defence were the principal object of nations every tribe would from its earliest state aim at the condition of a Tartar horde and in all its successes would hasten to the grandeur of a Tartar empire The military leader would supersede the civil magistrate and preparations to fly with all their possessions or to pursue with all their forces would in every society make the sum of their public arrangements  HE who first on the banks of the Wolga or the Jenisca had taught the Scythian to mount the horse to move his cottage on wheels to harass his enemy alike by his attacks and his flights to handle at full speed the lance and the bow and when beat from the field to leave his arrows in the wind to meet his pursuer he who had taught his countrymen to use the same animal for every purpose of the dairy the shambles and the field would be esteemed the founder of his nation or like Ceres and Bacchus among the Greeks would be invested with the honours of a god as the reward of his useful inventions Amidst such institutions the names and atchievements of Hercules and Jason might have been transmitted to posterity  but those of Lycurgus or Solon the heroes of political society could have gained no reputation either fabulous or real in the records of fame  EVERY tribe of warlike barbarians may entertain among themselves the strongest sentiments of affection and honour while they carry to the rest of mankind the aspect of banditti and robbers  D'Arvieux's Hist of the Arabs  They may be indifferent to interest and superior to danger but our sense of humanity our regard to the rights of nations our admiration of civil wisdom and justice even our effeminacy itself make us turn away with contempt or with horror from a scene which exhibits so few of our good qualities and which serve so much to reproach our weakness  IT is in conducting the affairs of civil society that mankind find the exercise of their best talents as well as the object of their best affections It is in being grafted on the advantages of civil society that the art of war is brought to perfection that the resources of armies and the complicated springs to be touched in their conduct are best understood The most celebrated warriors were also citizens Opposed to a Roman or a Greek the chieftain of Thrace of Germany or Gaul was a novice The native of Pella learned the principles of his art from Epaminondas and Pelopidas  IF nations as hath been observed in the preceding section must adjust their policy on the prospect of war from abroad they are equally bound to provide for the attainment of peace at home But there is no peace in the absence of justice It may subsist with divisions disputes and contrary opinions but not with the commission of wrongs The injurious and the injured are as implied in the very meaning of the terms in a state of hostility  WHERE men enjoy peace they owe it either to their mutual regards and affections or to the restraints of law Those are the happiest states which procure peace to their members by the first of these methods But it is sufficiently uncommon to procure it even by the second The first would withhold the occasions of war and of competition The second adjusts the pretensions of men by stipulations and treaties Sparta taught her citizens not to regard interest Other free nations secure the interest of their members and consider this as a principal part of their rights  LAW is the treaty to which members of the same community have agreed and under which the magistrate and the subject continue to enjoy their rights and to maintain the peace of society The desire of lucre is the great motive to injuries law therefore has a principal reference to property It would ascertain the different methods by which property may be acquired as by prescription conveyance and succession and it makes the necessary provisions for rendering the possession of property secure  BESIDE avarice there are other motives from which men are unjust such are pride malice envy and revenge The law would eradicate the principles themselves or at least prevent their effects  FROM whatever motive wrongs are committed there are different particulars in which the injured may suffer He may suffer in his goods in his person or in the freedom of his conduct Nature has made him master of every action which is not injurious to others The laws of his particular society intitle him perhaps to a determinate station and bestow on him a certain share in the government of his country An injury therefore which in this respect puts him under any unjust restraint may be called an infringement of his political rights  WHERE the citizen is supposed to have rights of property and of station and is protected in the exercise of them he is said to be free and the very restraints by which he is hindered from the commission of crimes are a part of his liberty No person is free where any person is suffered to do wrong with impunity Even the despotic prince on his throne is not an exception to this general rule He himself is a slave the moment he pretends that force should decide any contest The disregard he throws on the rights of his people recoils on himself and in the general uncertainty of all conditions there is no tenure more precarious than his own  FROM the different particulars to which men refer in speaking of liberty whether to the safety of the person and the goods the dignity of rank or the participation of political importance as well as from the different methods by which their rights are secured they are led to differ in the interpretation of the term and every people is apt to imagine that its signification is to be found only among themselves  SOME having thought that the unequal distribution of wealth is unjust required a new division of property as the foundation of freedom This scheme is suited to democratical government and in such only it has been admitted with any degree of effect  NEW settlements like that of the people of Israel and singular establishments like those of Sparta and Crete have furnished examples of its actual execution but in most other states even the democratical spirit could attain no more than to prolong the struggle for Agrarian laws to procure on occasion the expunging of debts and to keep the people in mind under all the distinctions of fortune that they still had a claim to equality  THE citizen at Rome at Athens and in many republics contended for himself and his order The Agrarian law was moved and debated for ages it served to awaken the mind it nourished the spirit of equality and furnished a field on which to exert its force but was never established with any of its other and more formal effects  MANY of the establishments which serve to defend the weak from oppression contribute by securing the possession of property to favour its unequal division and to increase the ascendant of those from whom the abuses of power may be feared Those abuses were felt very early both at Athens and Rome  Plutarch in the life of SolonLivy    IT has been proposed to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in particular hands by limiting the increase of private fortunes by prohibiting entails and by withholding the right of primogeniture in the succession of heirs It has been proposed to prevent the ruin of moderate estates and to restrain the use and consequently the desire of great ones by sumptuary laws These different methods are more or less consistent with the interests of commerce and may be adopted in different degrees by a people whose national object is wealth and they have their degree of effect by inspiring moderation or a sense of equality and by stifling the passions by which mankind are prompted to mutual wrongs  IT appears to be in a particular manner the object of sumptuary laws and of the equal division of wealth to prevent the gratification of vanity to check the ostentation of superior fortune and by this means to weaken the desire of riches and to preserve in the breast of the citizen that moderation and equity which ought to regulate his conduct  THIS end is never perfectly attained in any state where the unequal division of property is admitted and where fortune is allowed to bestow distinction and rank It is indeed difficult by any methods whatever to shut up this source of corruption Of all the nations whose history is known with certainty the design itself and the manner of executing it appear to have been understood in Sparta alone  THERE property was indeed acknowledged by law but in consequence of certain regulations and practices the most effectual it seems that mankind have hitherto found out The manners that prevail among simple nations before the establishment of property were in some measure preserved  See part sect  the passion for riches was during many ages suppressed and the citizen was made to consider himself as the property of his country not as the owner of a private estate  IT was held ignominious either to buy or to sell the patrimony of a citizen Slaves were in every family intrusted with the care of its effects and freemen were strangers to lucrative arts justice was established on a contempt of the ordinary allurement to crimes and the preservatives of civil liberty applied by the state were the dispositions that were made to prevail in the hearts of its members  THE individual was relieved from every solicitude that could arise on the head of his fortune he was educated and he was employed for life in the service of the public he was fed at a place of common resort to which he could carry no distinction but that of his talents and his virtues his children were the wards and the pupils of the state he himself was taught to be a parent and a director to the youth of his country not the anxious father of a separate family  THIS people we are told bestowed some care in adorning their persons and were known from afar by the red or the purple they wore but could not make their equipage their buildings or their furniture a subject of fancy or of what we call  taste  The carpenter and the housebuilder were restricted to the use of the axe and the saw their workmanship must have been simple and probably in respect to its form continued for ages the same The ingenuity of the artist was employed in cultivating his own nature not in adorning the habitations of his fellowcitizens  ON this plan they had senators magistrates leaders of armies and ministers of state but no men of fortune Like the heroes of Homer they distributed honours by the measure of the cup and the platter A citizen who in his political capacity was the arbiter of Greece thought himself honoured by receiving a double portion of plain entertainment at supper He was active pene+trating brave disinterested and generous bu  his estate his table and his furniture might  our esteem have marred the lustre of all his virtues Neighbouring nations however applied for commanders to this nursery of statesmen and warriors as we apply for the practitioners of every art to the countries in which they excel for cooks to France and for musicians to Italy  AFTER all we are perhaps not sufficiently instructed in the nature of the Spartan laws and institutions to understand in what manner all the ends of this singular state were obtained but the admiration paid to its people and the constant reference of contemporary historians to their avowed superiority will not allow us to question the facts  When I observed  says Xenophon  that this nation though not the most populous was the most powerful state of Greece I was seized with wonder and with an earnest desire to know by what arts it attained its preeminence but when I came to the knowledge of its institutions my wonder ceasedAs one man excels another and as he who is at pains to cultivate his mind must surpass the person who neglects it so the Spartans should excel every nation being the only state in which virtue is studied as the object of government'  THE subjects of property considered with a view to subsistence or even to enjoyment have little effect in corrupting mankind or in awakening the spirit of competition and of jealousy but considered with a view to distinction and honour where fortune constitutes rank they excite the most vehement passions and absorb all the sentiments of the human soul they reconcile avarice  and meanness with ambition and vanity and lead men through the practice of sordid and mercenary arts to the possession of a supposed elevation and dignity  WHERE this source of corruption on the contrary is effectually stopped the citizen is dutiful and the magistrate upright and form of government may be wisely administered places of trust are likely to be well supplied and by whatever rule office and power are bestowed it is likely that all the capacity and force that subsists in the state will come to be employed in its service for on this supposition experience and abilities are the only guides and the only titles to public confidence and if citizens be ranged into separate classes they become mutual checks by the difference of their opinions not by the opposition of their interested designs  WE may easily account for the censures bestowed on the government of Sparta by those who considered it merely on the side of its forms It was not calculated to prevent the practice of crimes by balancing against each other the selfish and partial dispositions of men but to inspire the virtues of the soul to procure innocence by the absence of criminal inclinations and to derive its internal peace from the indifference of its members to the ordinary motives of strife and disorder It were trifling to seek for its analogy to any other constitution of state in which its principal characteristic and distinguishing feature is not to be found The collegiate sovereignty the senate and the Ephori had their counterparts in other republics and a resemblance has been found in particular  to the government of Carthage  Aristotle  but what affinity of consequence can be found between a state whose sole object was virtue and another whose principal object was wealth between a people whose associated kings being lodged in the same cottage had no fortune but their daily food and commercial republic in which a proper estate was required as a necessary qualification for the higher offices of state  OTHER petty commonwealths expelled kings when they became jealous of their designs or after having experienced their tyranny here the hereditary succession of kings was preserved other states were afraid of the intrigues and cabals of their members in competition for dignities here solicitation was required as the only condition upon which a place in the senate was obtained A supreme inquisitorial power was in the persons of the ephori safely committed to a few men who were drawn by lot and without distinction from every order of the people and if a contrast to this as well as to many other articles of the Spartan policy be required it may be found in the general history of mankind  BUT Sparta under every supposed error of its form prospered for ages by the integrity of its manners and by the character of its citizens When that integrity was broken this people did not languish in the weakness of nations sunk in effeminacy They fell into the stream by which other states had been carried in the torrent of violent  passions and in the outrage of barbarous times They ran the career of other nations after that of ancient Sparta was finished They built walls and began to improve their possessions after they ceased to improve their people and on this new plan in their struggle for political life they survived the system of states that perished under the Macedonian dominion They lived to act with another which arose in the Achaean league and were the last community of Greece that became a village in the empire of Rome  IF it should be thought we have dwelt too long on the history of this singular people it may be remembered in excuse that they alone in the language of Xenophon made virtue an object of state  WE must be contented to derive our freedom from a different source to expect justice from the limits which are set to the powers of the magistrate and to rely for protection on the laws which are made to secure the estate and the person of the subject We live in societies where men must be rich in order to be great where pleasure itself is often pursued from vanity where the desire of a supposed happiness serves to inflame the worst of passions and is itself the foundation of misery where public justice like fetters applied to the body may without inspiring the sentiments of candour and equity prevent the actual commission of crimes  MANKIND come under this description the moment they are seized with their passions for riches and power But their description in every  instance is mixed in the best there is an alloy of evil in the worst a mixture of good Without any establishments to preserve their manners besides penal laws and the restraints of police they derive from instinctive feelings a love of integrity and candour and from the very contagion of society itself an esteem for what is honourable and praiseworthy They derive from their union and joint opposition to foreign enemies a zeal for their own community and courage to maintain its rights If the frequent neglect of virtue as a political object tend to discredit the understandings of men its lustre and its frequency as a spontaneous offspring of the heart will restore the honours of our nature  IN every casual and mixed state of the national manners the safety of every individual and his political consequence depends much on himself but more on the party to which he is joined For this reason all who feel a common interest are apt to unite in parties and as far as that interest requires mutually support each other  WHERE the citizens of any free community are of different orders each order has a peculiar set of claims and pretensions relatively to the other members of the state it is a party relatively to the differences of interest among its own members it may admit of numberless subdivisions But in every state there are two interests very readily apprehended that of a prince and his adherents that of a nobility or of any temporary faction opposed to the people  WHERE the sovereign power is reserved by the collective body it appears unnecessary to think  of additional establishments for securing the rights of the citizen But it is difficult if not impossible for the collective body to exercise this power in a manner that supersedes the necessity of every other political caution  IF popular assemblies assume every function of government and if in the same tumultuous manner in which they can with great propriety express their feelings the sense of their rights and their animosity to foreign or domestic enemies they pretend to deliberate on points of national conduct or to decide questions of equity and justice the public is exposed to manifold inconveniencies and popular governments would of all others be the most subject to errors in administration and to weakness in the execution of public measures  TO avoid these disadvantages the people are always contented to delegate part of their powers They establish a senate to debate and to prepare if not to determine questions that are brought to the collective body for a final resolution They commit the executive power to some council of this sort or to a magistrate who presides in their meetings Under the use of this necessary and common expedient even while democratical forms are most carefully guarded there is one party of the few another of the many One attacks the other defends and they are both ready to assume in their turns But though in reality a great danger to liberty arises on the part of the people themselves who in times of corruption are easily made the instruments of usurpation and tyranny yet in the ordinary aspect of government the  executive carries an air of superiority and the rights of the people seem always exposed to incroachment  THOUGH on the day that the Roman people assembled in their tribes the senators mixed with the croud and the consul was no more than the servant of the multitude yet when this awful meeting was dissolved the senators met to prescribe business for their sovereign and the consul went armed with the axe and the rods to teach every Roman in his separate capacity the submission which he owed to the state  THUS even where the collective body is sovereign they are assembled only occasionally and though on such occasions they determine every question relative to their rights and their interests as a people and can assert their freedom with irresistible force yet they do not think themselves nor are they in reality safe without a more constant and more uniform power operating in their favour  THE multitude is every where strong but requires for the safety of its members when separate as well as when assembled a head to direct and to employ its strength For this purpose the ephori we are told were established at Sparta the council of a hundred at Carthage and the tribunes at Rome So prepared the popular party has in many instances been able to cope with its adversaries and has even trampled on the powers whether aristocratical or monarchical with which it would have been otherwise unequally matched The state in such cases commonly  suffered by the delays interruptions and confusions which popular leaders from private envy or a prevailing jealousy of the great seldom failed to create in the proceedings of government  WHERE the people as in some larger communities have only a share in the legislature they cannot overwhelm the collateral powers who having likewise a share are in condition to defend themselves Where they act only by their representatives their force may be uniformly employed And they may make part in a constitution of government more lasting than any of those in which the people possessing or pretending to the entire legislature are when assembled the tyrants and when dispersed the slaves of a distempered state In governments properly mixed the popular interest finding a counterpoise in that of the prince or of the nobles a balance is actually established between them in which the public freedom and the public order are made to consist  FROM some such casual arrangement of different interests all the varieties of mixed government proceed and on the degree of consideration which every separate interest can procure to itself depends the equity of the laws they enact and the necessity they are able to impose of adhering strictly to the terms of law in its execution States are accordingly unequally qualified to conduct the business of legislation and unequally fortunate in the completeness and regular observance of their civil code  IN democratical establishments citizens feeling themselves possessed of the sovereignty are not equally anxious with the subject of other  governments to have their rights explained or secured by actual statute They trust to personal vigour to the support of party and to the sense of the public  IF the collective body perform the office of judge as well as of legislator they seldom think of devising rules for their own direction and are found still more seldom to follow any determinate rule after it is made They dispense at one time with what they enacted at another and in their judicative perhaps even more than in their legislative capacity are guided by passions and partialties that arise from circumstances of the case before them  BUT under the simplest governments of a different sort whether aristocracy or monarchy there is a necessity for law and there are a variety of interests to be adjusted in framing every statute The sovereign wishes to give stability and order to administration by express and promulgated rules The subject wishes to know the conditions and limits of his duty He acquiesces or he revolts according as the terms on which he is made to live with the sovereign or with his fellowsubjects are or are not consistent with the sense of his rights  NEITHER the monarch nor the council of nobles where either is possessed of the sovereignty can pretend to govern or to judge at discretion No magistrate whether temporary or hereditary can with safety neglect that reputation for justice and equity from which his authority and the respect that is paid to his person are in a great  measure derived Nations however have been fortunate in the tenor and in the execution of their laws in proportion as they have admitted every order of the people by representation or otherwise to an actual share of the legislature Under establishments of this sort law is literally a treaty to which the parties concerned have agreed and have given their opinion in settling its terms The interests to be affected by a law are likewise consulted in making it Every class propounds an objection suggests an addition or an amendment of its own They proceed to adjust by statute every subject of controversy and while they continue to enjoy their freedom they continue to multiply laws and to accumulate volumes as if they could remove every possible ground of dispute and were secure of their rights merely by having put them in writing  ROME and England under their mixed governments the one inclining to democracy the other to monarchy have proved the great legislators among nations The first has left the foundation and great part of the superstructure of its civil code to the continent of Europe the other in its island has carried the authority and government of law to a point of perfection which they never before attained in the history of mankind  UNDER such favourable establishments known customs the practice and decisions of courts as well as positive statutes acquire the authority of laws and every proceeding is conducted by some fixed and determinate rule The best and most effectual precautions are taken for the impartial application of rules to particular cases and it is  remarkable that in the two examples we have mentioned a surprising coincidence is found in the singular methods of their jurisdiction The people in both reserved in a manner the office of judgement to themselves and brought the decision of civil rights or of criminal questions to the tribunal of peers who in judging of their fellowcitizens prescribed a condition of life for themselves  IT is not in mere laws after all that we are to look for the securities to justice but in the powers by which those laws have been obtained and without whose constant support they must fall to disuse Statutes serve to record the rights of a people and speak the intention of parties to defend what the letter of the law has expressed but without the vigour to maintain what is acknowledged as a right the mere record or the feeble intention is of little avail  A POPULACE roused by oppression or an order of men possessed of a temporary advantage have obtained many charters concessions and stipulations in favour of their claims but where no adequate preparation was made to preserve them the written articles were often forgotten together with the occasion on which they were framed  THE history of England and of every free country abounds with the example of statutes enacted when the people or their representatives assembled but never executed when the crown or the executive was left to itself The most equitable laws on paper are consistent with the utmost  despotism in administration Even the form of trial by juries in England had its authority in law while the proceedings of courts were arbitrary and oppressive  WE must admire as the keystone of civil liberty the statute which forces the secrets of every prison to be revealed the cause of every commitment to be declared and the person of the accused to be produced that he may claim his enlargement or his trial within a limited time No wiser form was ever opposed to the abuses of power But it requires a fabric no less than the whole political constitution of Great Britain a spirit no less than the refractory and turbulent zeal of this fortunate people to secure its effects  IF even the sasety of the person and the tenure of property which may be so well defined in the words of a statute depend for their preservation on the vigour and jealousy of a free people and on the degree of consideration which every order of the state maintains for itself it is still more evident that what we have called the political freedom or the right of the individual to act in his station for himself and the public cannot be made to rest on any other foundation The estate may be saved and the person released by the forms of a civil procedure but the rights of the mind cannot be sustained by any other force but its own  SECT VII  Of the History of Arts  WE have already observed that art is natural to man and that the skill he acquires after many ages of practice is only the improvement of a talent he possessed at the first Vitruvius finds the rudiments of architecture in the form of a Scythian cottage The armourer may find the first productions of his calling in the sling and the bow and the shipwright of his in the canoe of the savage Even the historian and the poet may find the original essays of their arts in the tale and the song which celebrate the wars the loves and the adventures of men in their rudest condition  DESTINED to cultivate his own nature or to mend his situation man finds a continual subject of attention ingenuity and labour Even where he does not propose any personal improvement his faculties are strengthened by those very exercises in which he seems to forget himself his reason and his affections are thus profitably engaged in the affairs of society his invention and his skill are exercised in procuring his accommodations and his food his particular pursuits are prescribed to him by circumstances of the age and of the country in which he lives in one situation he is occupied with wars and political deliberations in  another with the care of his interest of his personal ease or conveniency He suits his means to the ends he has in view and by multiplying contrivances proceeds by degrees to the perfection of his arts In every step of his progress if his skill be increased his desire must likewise have time to extend and it would be as vain to suggest a contrivance of which he sighted the use as it would be to tell him of blessings which he could not command  AGES are generally supposed to have borrowed from those who went before them and nations to have derived their portion of learning or of art from abroad The Romans are thought to have learned from the Greeks and the moderns of Europe from both In this imagination we frequently proceed so far as to admit of nothing original in the practice or manners of any people The Greek was a copy of the Egyptian and even the Egyptian was an imitator though we have lost sight of the model on which he was formed  IT is known that men improve by example and intercourse but in the case of nations whose members excite and direct each other why seek from abroad the origin of arts of which every society having the principles in itself only requires a favourable occasion to bring them to light When such occasion presents itself to any people they generally seize it and while it continues they improve the inventions to which it gave rise among themselves or they willingly copy from others but they never employ their own invention nor look abroad for instruction on subjects that do not lie in the way of their common pursuits they never  adopt a refinement of which they have not discovered the use  INVENTIONS we frequently observe are accidental but it is probable that an accident which escapes the artist in one age may be seized by one who succeeds him and who is better apprised of its use Where circumstances are favourable and where a people is intent on the objects of any art every invention is preserved by being brought into general practice every model is studied and every accident is turned to account If nations actually borrow from their neighbours they probably borrow only what they are nearly in a condition to have invented themselves  ANY singular practice of one country therefore is seldom transferred to another till the way be prepared by the introduction of similiar circumstances Hence our frequent complaints of the dullness or obstinacy of mankind and of the dilatory communication of arts from one place to another While the Romans adopted the arts of Greece the Thracians and Illyrians continued to behold them with indifference Those arts were during one period confined to the Greek colonies and during another to the Roman Even where they were spread by a visible intercourse they were still received by independent nations with the slowness of invention They made a progress not more rapid at Rome than they had done at Athens and they passed to the extremities of the Roman empire only in company with new colonies and joined to Italian policy  THE modern race who came abroad to the possession of cultivated provinces retained the arts  they had practised at home the new master hunted the boar or pastured his herds where he might have raised a plentiful harvest he built a cottage in the view of a palace he buried in one common ruin the edifices sculptures paintings and libraries of the former inhabitant he made a settlement upon a plan of his own and opened anew the source of inventions without perceiving from a distance to what length their progress might lead his posterity The cottage of the present race like that of the former by degrees enlarged its dimensions public buildings acquired a magnificence in a new taste Even this taste came in a course of ages to be exploded and the people of Europe recurred to the models which their fathers destroyed and wept over the ruins which they could not restore  THE literary remains of antiquity were studied and imitated after the original genius of modern nations had broke forth the rude efforts of poetry in Italy and Provence resembled those of the Greeks and the ancient Romans How far the merit of our works might without the aid of their models have risen by successive improvements or whether we have gained more by imitation than we have lost by quitting our native system of thinking and our vein of fable must be left to conjecture We are certainly indebted to them for the materials as well as the form of many of our compositions and without their example the strain of our literature together with that of our manners and policy would have been different from what they at present are This much however may be said with assurance that although the Roman and the modern literature savour alike of the Greek original  yet mankind in either instance would not have drank of this fountain unless they had been hastening to open springs of their own  SENTIMENT and fancy the use of the hand or the head are not inventions of particular men and the flourishing of arts that depend on them are in the case of any people a proof rather of political felicity at home than of any instruction received from abroad or of any natural superiority in point of industry or talents  WHEN the attentions of men are turned toward particular subjects when the acquisitions of one age are left entire to the next when every individual is protected in his place and left to pursue the suggestion of his wants devices accumulate and it is difficult to find the original of any art The steps which lead to perfection are many and we are at a loss on whom to bestow the greatest share of our praise on the first or on the last who may have bore a part in the progress  SECT VIII  Of the History of Literature  IF we may rely on the general observations contained in the last section the literary as well as mechanical arts being a natural produce of the human mind will rise spontaneously whereever men are happily placed and in certain nations it is not more necessary to look abroad for the origin of literature than it is for the suggestion of any of the pleasures or exercises in which mankind under a state of prosperity and freedom are sufficiently inclined to indulge themselves  WE are apt to consider arts as foreign and adventitious to the nature of man but there is no art that did not find its occasion in human life and that was not in some one or other of the situations in which our species is found suggested as a means for the attainment of some useful end The mechanic and commercial arts took their rise from the love of property and were encouraged by the prospects of safety and of gain the literary and liberal arts took their rise from the understanding the fancy and the heart They are mere exercises of the mind in search of its peculiar pleasures and occupations and are promoted by circumstances that suffer the mind to enjoy itself  MEN are equally engaged by the past the present and the future and are prepared for every occupation that gives scope to their powers Productions therefore whether of narration fiction or reasoning that tend to employ the imagination or move the heart continue for ages a subject of attention and a source of delight The memory of human transactions being preserved in tradition or writing is the natural gratification of a passion that consists of curiosity admiration and the love of amusement  BEFORE many books are written and before science is greatly advanced the productions of mere genius are sometimes complete the performer requires not the aid of learning where his description or story relates to near and contiguous objects where it relates to the conduct and characters of men with whom he himself has acted and in whose occupations and fortunes he himself has borne a part  WITH this advantage the poet is the first to offer the fruits of his genius and to lead in the career of those arts by which the mind is destined to exhibit its imaginations and to express its passions Every tribe of barbarians have their passionate or historic rhymes which contain the superstition the enthusiasm and the admiration of glory with which the breasts of men in the earliest state of society are possessed They delight in versecompositions either because the cadence of numbers is natural to the language of sentiment or because not having the advantage of writing they are obliged to bring the ear in aid of the memory  in order to facilitate the repetition and insure the preservation of their works  WHEN we attend to the language which savages employ on any solemn occasion it appears that man is a poet by nature Whether at first obliged by the mere defects of his tongue and the scantiness of proper expressions or seduced by a pleasure of the fancy in stating the analogy of its objects he clothes every conception in image and metaphor  We have planted the tree of peace  says an American orator  we have buried the axe under its roots we will henceforth repose under its shade we will join to brighten the chain that binds our nations together  Such are the collections of metaphor which those nations employ in their public harangues They have likewise already adopted those lively figures and that daring freedom of language which the learned have afterwards found so well fitted to express the rapid transitions of the imagination and the ardours of a passionate mind  IF we are required to explain how men could be poets or orators before they were aided by the learning of the scholar and the critic we may inquire in our turn how bodies could fall by their weight before the laws of gravitation were recorded in books Mind as well as body has laws which are exemplified in the practice of men and which the critic collects only after the example has shewn what they are  OCCASIONED probably by the physical connection we have mentioned between the emotions of a heated imagination and the impressions received  from music and pathetic sounds every tale among rude nations is repeated in verse and is made to take the form of a song The early history of all nations is uniform in this particular Priests statesmen and philosophers in the first ages of Greece delivered their instructions in poetry and mixed with the dealers in music and heroic fable  IT is not so surprising however that poetry should be the first species of composition in every nation as it is that a style apparently so difficult and so far removed from ordinary use should be almost as universally the first to attain its maturity The most admired of all poets lived beyond the reach of history almost of tradition The artless song of the savage the heroic legend of the bard have sometimes a magnificent beauty which no change of language can improve and no refinements of the critic reform  UNDER the supposed disadvantage of a limited knowledge and a rude apprehension the simple poet has impressions that more than compensate the defects of his skill The best subjects of poetry the characters of the violent and the brave the generous and the intrepid great dangers trials of fortitude and fidelity are exhibited within his view or are delivered in traditions which animate like truth because they are equally believed He is not engaged in recalling like Virgil or Tasso the sentiments or scenery of an age remote from his own he needs not be told by the critic  See Longinus  to  recollect what another would have have thought or in what manner another would have expressed his conception The simple passions friendship resentment and love are the movements of his own mind and he has no occasion to copy Simple and vehement in his conceptions and feelings he knows no diversity of thought or of style to mislead or to exercise his judgement He delivers the emotions of the heart in words suggested by the heart for he knows no other And hence it is that while we admire the judgement and invention of Virgil and of other later poets these terms appear misapplied to Homer Though intelligent as well as sublime in his conceptions we cannot anticipate the lights of his understanding nor the movements of his heart he appears to speak from inspiration not from invention and to be guided in the choice of his thoughts and expressions by a supernatural instinct not by reflection  THE language of early ages is in one respect simple and confined in another it is varied and free it allows liberties which to the poet of after times are denied  IN rude ages men are not separated by distinctions of rank or profession They live in one manner and speak one dialect The bard is not to chuse his expression among the singular accents of different conditions He has not to guard his language from the peculiar errors of the mechanic the peasant the scholar or the courtier in order to find that elegant propriety and just elevation which is free from the vulgar of one class the pedantic of the second or the flippant of the third The name of every object and of every  sentiment is fixed and if his conception has the dignity of nature his expression will have a purity which does not depend on his choice  WITH this apparent confinement in the choice of his words he is at liberty to break through the ordinary modes of construction and in the form of a language not established by rules may find for himself a cadence agreeable to the tone of his mind The liberty he takes while his meaning is striking and his language is raised appears an improvement not a trespass on grammar He delivers a style to the ages that follow and becomes a model from which his posterity judge  BUT whatever may be the early disposition of mankind to poetry or the advantages they possess in cultivating this species of literature whether the early maturity of poetical compositions arise from their being the first studied or from their having a charm to engage persons of the liveliest genius who are best qualified to improve the eloquence of their native tongue it is a remarkable fact that not only in countries where every vein of composition was original and was opened in the order of natural succession but even at Rome and in modern Europe where the learned began early to practise on foreign models we have poets of every nation who are perused with pleasure while the prose writers of the same ages are neglected  AS Sophocles and Euripides preceded the historians and moralists of Greece not only Naevius and Ennius who wrote the Roman history in verse but Lucilius Plautus Terence and we  may add Lucretius were prior to Cicero Sallust or Caesar Dante and Petrarch went before any good prose writer in Italy Corneille and Racine brought on the fine age of prose compositions in France and we had in England not only Chaucer and Spencer but Shakespear and Milton while our attempts in history or science were yet in their infancy and deserve our attention only for the sake of the matter they treat  HILLANICUS who is reckoned among the first prose writers in Greece and who immediately preceded or was the contemporary of Herodotus set out with declaring his intention to remove from history the wild representations and extravagant fictions with which it had been disgraced by the poets  Quoted by Demetrius Phalerius  The want of records or authorities relating to any distant transactions may have hindered him as it did his immediate successor from giving truth all the advantage it might have reaped from this transition to prose There are however ages in the progress of society when such a proposition must be favourably received When men become occupied on the subjects of policy or commercial arts they wish to be informed and instructed as well as moved They are interested by what was real in past transactions They build on this foundation the reflections and reasonings they apply to present affairs and wish to receive information on the subject of different pursuits and of projects in which they begin to be engaged The manners of men the practice of ordinary life and the form of society furnish  their subjects to the moral and political writer Mere ingenuity justness of sentiment and correct representation though conveyed in ordinary language are understood to constitute literary merit and by applying to reason more than to the imagination and passions meet with a reception that is due to the instruction they bring  THE talents of men come to be employed in a variety of affairs and their inquiries directed to different subjects Knowledge is important in every department of civil society and requisite to the practice of every art The science of nature morals politics and history find their several admirers and even poetry itself which retains its former station in the region of warm imagination and enthusiastic passion appears in a growing variety of forms  MATTERS have proceeded so far without the aid of foreign examples or the direction of schools The cart of Thespia was changed into a theatre not to gratify the learned but to please the Athenian populace and the prize of poetical merit was decided by this populace equally before and after the invention of rules The Greeks were unacquainted with every language but their own and if they became learned it was only by studying what they themselves had produced the childish mythology which they are said to have copied from Asia was equally of little avail in promoting their love of arts or their success in the practice of them  WHEN the historian is struck with the events he has witnessed or heard when he is excited to relate them by his reflections or his passions when the statesman who is required to speak in public is obliged to prepare for every remarkable appearance in studied harangues when conversation becomes extensive and refined and when the social feelings and reflections of men are committed to writing a system of learning may arise from the bustle of an active life Society itself is the school and its lessons are delivered in the practice of real affairs An author writes from observations he has made on his subject not from the suggestion of books and every production carries the mark of his character as a man not of his mere proficiency as a student or scholar It may be made a question whether the trouble of seeking for distant models and of wading for instruction through dark allusions and languages unknown might not have quenched his fire and rendered him a writer of a very inferior class  IF society may thus be considered as a school for letters it is probable that its lessons are varied in every separate state and in every age For a certain period the severe applications of the Roman people to policy and war suppressed the literary arts and appear to have stifled the genius even of the historian and the poet The institutions of Sparta gave a professed contempt for whatever was not connected with the practical virtues of a vigorous and resolute spirit the charms of imagination and the parade of language were by this people classed with the arts of the cook and the  perfumer their songs in praise of fortitude are mentioned by some writers and collections of their witty sayings and repartees are still preserved they indicate the virtues and the abilities of an active people not their proficiency in science or literary taste Possessed of what was essential to happiness in the virtues of the heart they had a discernment of its value unimbarrassed by the numberless objects on which mankind in general are so much at a loss to adjust their esteem fixed in their own apprehension they turned a sharp edge on the follies of mankind  When will you begin to practise  was the question of a Spartan to a person who in an anvanced age of life was still occupied with questions on the nature of virtue  WHILE this people confined their studies to one question How to improve and to preserve the courage and the disinterested affections of the human heart their rivals the Athenians gave a scope to refinement on every object of reflection or passion By the rewards either of profit or of reputation which they bestowed on every effort of ingenuity employed in ministering to the pleasure the decoration or the conveniency of life by the variety of conditions in which their citizens were placed by their inequalities of fortune and their several pursuits in war politics commerce and lucrative arts they awakened whatever was either good or bad in the natural dispositions of men Every road to eminence was opened eloquence fortitude military skill envy detraction faction and treason even the muse herself was courted to bestow importance among a busy acute and turbulent people  FROM this example we may safely conclude that although business is sometimes a rival to study retirement and leisure are not the principal requisites to the improvement perhaps not even to the exercise of literary talents The most striking exertions of imagination and sentiment have a reference to mankind they are excited by the presence and intercourse of men they have most vigour when actuated in the mind by the operation of its principal springs by the emulations the friendships and the oppositions which subsist among a forward and aspiring people Amidst the great occasions which put a free and even a licentious society in motion its members become capable of every exertion and the same scenes which gave employment to Themistocles and Thrasybulus inspired by contagion the genius of Sophocles and Plato The petulant and the ingenuous find an equal scope to their talents and literary monuments become the repositories of envy and folly as well as of wisdom and virtue  GREECE divided into many little states and agitated beyond any spot on the globe by domestic contentions and foreign wars set the example in every species of literature The fire was communicated to Rome not when the state ceased to be warlike and had discontinued her political agitations but when she mixed the love of refinement and of pleasure with her national pursuits and indulged an inclination to study in the midst of ferments occasioned by the wars and pretensions of opposite factions It was revived in modern Europe among the turbulent states of  Italy and spread to the North together with the spirit which shook the fabric of the Gothic policy it rose while men were divided into parties under civil or religious denominations and when they were at variance on subjects held the most important and sacred  WE may be satisfied from the example of many ages that liberal endowments bestowed on learned societies and the leisure with which they were furnished for study are not the likeliest means to excite the exertions of genius even science itself the supposed offspring of leisure pined in the shade of monastic retirement Men at a distance from the objects of useful knowledge untouched by the motives that animate an active and a vigorous mind could produce only the jargon of a technical language and accumulate the impertinence of accademical forms  TO speak or to write justly from an observation of nature it is necessary to have felt the sentiments of nature He who is penetrating and ardent in the conduct of life will probably exert a proportional force and ingenuity in the exercise of his literary talents and although writing may become a trade and require all the application and study which are bestowed on any other calling yet the principal requisites in this calling are the spirit and sensibility of a vigorous mind  IN one period the school may take its light and direction from active life in another it is true the remains of an active spirit are greatly supported by literary monuments and by the history  of transactions that preserve the examples and the experience of former and of better times But in whatever manner men are formed for great efforts of elocution or conduct it appears the most glaring of all other deceptions to look for the accomplishments of a human character in the mere attainments of speculation whilst we neglect the qualities of fortitude and public affection which are so necessary to render our knowledge an article of happiness or of use  PART FOURTH  Of Consequences that result from the Advancement of Civil and Commercial Arts  SECT I  Of the Separation of Arts and Professions  IT is evident that however urged by a sense of necessity and a desire of convenience or favoured by any advantages of situation and policy a people can make no great progress in cultivating the arts of life until they have separated and committed to different persons the several tasks which require a peculiar skill and attention The savage or the barbarian who must build and plant and fabricate for himself prefers in the interval of great alarms and fatigues the enjoyments of sloth to the improvement of his fortune he is  perhaps by the diversity of his wants discouraged from industry or by his divided attention prevented from acquiring skill in the management of any particular subject  THE enjoyment of peace however and the prospect of being able to exchange one commodity for another turns by degrees the hunter and the warrior into a tradesman and a merchant The accidents which distribute the means of subsistence unequally inclination and favourable opportunities assign the different occupations of men and a sense of utility leads them without end to subdivide their professions  THE artist finds that the more he can confine his attention to a particular part of any work his productions are the more perfect and grow under his hands in the greater quantities Every undertaker in manufacture finds that the more he can subdivide the tasks of his workmen and the more hands he can employ on separate articles the more are his expences diminished and his profits increased The consumer too requires in every kind of commodity a workmanship more perfect than hands employed on a variety of subjects can produce and the progress of commerce is but a continued subdivision of the mechanical arts  EVERY craft may ingross the whole of a man's attention and has a mystery which must be studied or learned by a regular apprenticeship Nations of tradesmen come to consist of members who beyond their own particular trade are ignorant of all human affairs and who may contribute to the preservation and enlargement of their commonwealth  without making its interest an object of their regard or attention Every individual is distinguished by his calling and has a place to which he is fitted The savage who knows no distinction but that of his merit of his sex or of his species and to whom his community is the sovereign object of his affection is astonished to find that in a scene of this nature his being a man does not qualify him for any station whatever he flies to the woods with amazement distaste and aversion  BY the separation of arts and professions the sources of wealth are laid open every species of material is wrought up to the greatest perfection and every commodity is produced in the greatest abundance The state may estimate its profits and its revenues by the number of its people It may procure by its treasure that national consideration and power which the savage maintains at the expence of his blood  THE advantage gained in the inferior branches of manufacture by the separation of their parts seem to be equalled by those which arise from a similar device in the higher departments of policy and war The soldier is relieved from every care but that of his service statesmen divide the business of civil government into shares and the servants of the public in every office without being skilful in the affairs of state may succeed by observing forms which are already established on the experience of others They are made like the parts of an engine to concur to a purpose without any concert of their own and equally blind with the trader to any general combination they  unite with him in furnishing to the state its resources its conduct and its force  THE artifices of the beaver the ant and the bee are ascribed to the wisdom of nature Those of polished Nations are ascribed to themselves and are supposed to indicate a capacity superior to that of rude minds But the establishments of men like those of every animal are suggested by nature and are the result of instinct directed by the variety of situations in which mankind are placed Those establishments arose from successive improvements that were made without any sense of their general effect and they bring human affairs to a state of complication which the greatest reach of capacity with which human nature was ever adorned could not have projected nor even when the whole is carried into execution can it be comprehended in its full extent  WHO could anticipate or even enumerate the separate occupations and professions by which the members of any commercial state are distinguished the variety of devices which are practised in separate cells and which the artist attentive to his own affair has invented to abridge or to facilitate his separate task In coming to this mighty end every generation compared to its predecessors may have appeared to be ingenious compared to its followers may have appeared to be dull and human ingenuity whatever heights it may have gained in a succession of ages continues to move with an equal pace and to creep in making the last as well as the first step of commercial or civil improvement  IT may even be doubted whether the measure of national capacity increases with the advancement of arts Many mechanical arts indeed require no capacity they succeed best under a total suppression of sentiment and reason and ignorance is the mother of industry as well as of superstition Reflection and fancy are subject to err but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent of either Manufactures accordingly prosper most where the mind is least consulted and where the workshop may without any great effort of imagination be considered as an engine the parts of which are men  THE forest has been felled by the savage without the use of the axe and weights have been raised without the aid of the mechanical powers The merit of the inventor in every branch probably deserves a preference to that of the performer and he who invented a tool or could work without its assistance deserved the praise of ingenuity in a much higher degree than the mere artist who by its assistance produces a superior work  BUT if many parts in the practice of every art and in the detail of every department require no abilities or actually tend to contract and to limit the views of the mind there are others which lead to general reflections and to enlargement of thought Even in manufacture the genius of the master perhaps is cultivated while that of the inferior workman lies waste The statesman may have a wide comprehension of human affairs while the tools he employs are ignorant of the system in which they are themselves combined The general  officer may be a great proficient in the knowledge of war while the soldier is confined to a few motions of the hand and the foot The former may have gained what the latter has lost and being occupied in the conduct of disciplined armies may practise on a larger scale all the arts of preservation of deception and of stratagem which the savage exerts in leading a small party or merely in defending himself  THE practitioner of every art and profession may afford matter of general speculation to the man of science and thinking itself in this age of separations may become a peculiar craft In the bustle of civil pursuits and occupations men appear in a variety of lights and suggest matter of inquiry and fancy by which conversation is enlivened and greatly enlarged The productions of ingenuity are brought to the market and men are willing to pay for whatever has a tendency to inform or amuse By this means the idle as well as the busy contribute to forward the progress of arts and bestow on polished nations that air of superior ingenuity under which they appear to have gained the ends that were pursued by the sa+vage in his forest knowledge order and wealth  SECT II  Of the Subordination consequent to the Separation of Arts and Professions  THERE is one ground of subordination in the difference of natural talents and dispositions a second in the unequal division of property and a third not less sensible in the habits which are acquired by the practice of different arts  SOME employments are liberal others mechanic They require different talents and inspire different sentiments and whether or not this be the cause of the preference we actually give it is certainly reasonable to form our opinion of the rank that is due to men of certain professions and stations from the influence of their manner of life in cultivating the powers of the mind or in preserving the sentiments of the heart  THERE is an elevation natural to man by which he would be thought in his rudest state however urged by necessity to rise above the consideration of mere subsistence and the regards of interests He would appear to act only from the heart in its engagements of friendship or opposition he would shew himself only upon occasions of danger or difficulty and leave ordinary cares to the weak or the servile  THE same apprehensions in every situation regulate his notions of meanness or of dignity In that of polished society his desire to avoid the character of sordid makes him conceal his regard for what relates merely to his preservation or his livelihood In his estimation the beggar who depends upon charity the labourer who toils that he may eat the mechanic whose art requires no exertion of genius are degraded by the object they pursue and by the means they employ to attain it Professions requiring more knowledge and study proceeding on the exercise of fancy and the love of perfection leading to applause as well as to profit place the artist in a superior class and bring him nearer to that station in which men are supposed to be highest because in it they are bound to no task because they are left to follow the disposition of the mind and to take that part in society to which they are led by the sentiments of the heart or by the calls of the public  THIS last was the station which in the distinction betwixt freemen and slaves the citizens of every ancient republic strove to gain and to maintain for themselves Women or slaves in the earliest ages had been set apart for the purposes of domestic care or bodily labour and in the progress of lucrative arts the latter were bred to mechanical professions and were even intrusted with merchandise for the benefit of their masters Freemen would be understood to have no object beside those of politics and war In this manner the honours of one half of the species were sacrificed to those of the other as stones from the same quarry are buried in the foundation to sustain  the blocks which happen to be hewn for the superior parts of the pile In the midst of our encomiums bestowed on the Greeks and the Romans we are by this circumstance made to remember that no human institution is perfect  IN many of the Grecian states the benefits arising to the free from this cruel distinction were not conferred equally on all the citizens Wealth being unequally divided the rich alone were exempted from labour the poor were reduced to work for their own subsistence interest was a reigning passion in both and the possession of slaves like that of any other lucrative property became an object of avarice not an exemption from sordid attentions The entire effects of the institution were obtained or continued to be enjoyed for any considerable time at Sparta alone We feel its injustice we suffer for the helot under the severities and unequal treatment to which he was exposed but when we think only of the superior order of men in this state when we attend to that elevation and magnanimity of spirit for which danger had no terror interest no means to corrupt when we consider them as friends or as citizens we are apt to forget like themselves that slaves have a title to be treated like men  WE look for elevation of sentiment and liberality of mind among those orders of citizens who by their condition and their fortunes are relieved from sordid cares and attentions This was the description of a free man at Sparta and if the lot of a slave among the ancients was really more wretched than that of the indigent labourer and the mechanic among the moderns it may be  doubted whether the superior orders who are in possession of consideration and honours do not proportionally fail in the dignity which befits their condition If the pretensions to equal justice and freedom should terminate in rendering every class equally servile and mercenary we make a nation of helots and have no free citizens  IN every commercial state notwithstanding any pretension to equal rights the exaltation of a few must depress the many In this arrangement we think that the extreme meanness of some classes must arise chiefly from the defect of knowledge and of liberal education and we refer to such classes as to an image of what our species must have been in its rude and uncultivated state But we forget how many circumstances especially in populous cities tend to corrupt the lowest orders of men Ignorance is the least of their failings An admiration of wealth unpossessed becoming a principle of envy or of servility a habit of acting perpetually with a view to profit and under a sense of subjection the crimes to which they are allured in order to feed their debauch or to gratify their avarice are examples not of ignorance but of corruption and baseness If the savage has not received our instructions he is likewise unacquainted with our vices He knows no superior and cannot be servile he knows no distinctions of fortune and cannot be envious he acts from his talents in the highest station which human society can offer that of the counsellor and the soldier of his country Toward forming his sentiments he knows all that the heart requires to be known he can distinguish the friend whom he loves and the public interest which awakens his zeal  THE principal objections to democratical or popular government are taken from the inequalities which arise among men in the result of commercial arts And it must be confessed that popular assemblies when composed of men whose dispositions are sordid and whose ordinary applications are illiberal however they may be intrusted with the choice of their masters and leaders are certainly in their own persons unfit to command How can he who has confined his views to his own subsistence or preservation be intrusted with the conduct of nations Such men when admitted to deliberate on matters of state bring to its councils confusion and tumult or servility and corruption and seldom suffer it to repose from ruinous factions or the effect of resolutions ill formed or ill conducted  THE Athenians retained their popular government under all these defects The mechanic was obliged under a penalty to appear in the public marketplace and to hear debates on the subjects of war and of peace He was tempted by pecuniary rewards to attend on the trial of civil and criminal causes But notwithstanding an exercise tending so much to cultivate their talents the indigent came always with minds intent upon profit or with the habits of an illiberal calling Sunk under the sense of their personal disparity and weakness they were ready to resign themselves entirely to the influence of some popular leader who flattered their passions and wrought on their sears or actuated by envy they were ready to banish from the state whomsoever was respectable and eminent in the superior order of citizens  and whether from their neglect of the public at one time or their maleadministration at another the sovereignty was every moment ready to drop from their hands  THE people in this case are in fact frequently governed by one or a few who know how to conduct them Pericles possessed a species of princely authority at Athens Crassus Pompey and Caesar either jointly or successively possessed for a considerable period the sovereign direction at Rome  WHETHER in great or in small states democracy is preserved with difficulty under the disparities of condition and the unequal cultivation of the mind which attend the variety of pursuits and applications that separate mankind in the advanced state of commercial arts In this however we do but plead against the form of democracy after the principle is removed and see the absurdity of pretensions to equal influence and consideration after the characters of men have ceased to be similar  SECT III  Of the Manners of Polished and Commercial Nations  MANKIND when in their rude state have a great uniformity of manners but when civilized they are engaged in a variety of pursuits they tread on a larger field and separate to a greater distance If they be guided however by similar dispositions and by like suggestions of nature they will probably in the end as well as in the beginning of their progress continue to agree in many particulars and while communities admit in their members that diversity of ranks and professions which we have already described as the consequence or the foundation of commerce they will resemble each other in many effects of this distribution and of other circumstances in which they nearly concur  UNDER every form of government statesmen endeavour to remove the dangers by which they are threatened from abroad and the disturbances which molest them at home By this conduct if successful they in a few ages gain an ascendant for their country establish a frontier at a distance from its capital they find in the mutual desires of tranquility which come to possess mankind and in those public establishments which tend to keep the peace of society a respite from foreign wars and a relief from domestic disorders They  learn to decide every contest without tumult and to secure by the authority of law every citizen in the possession of his personal rights  IN this condition to which thriving nations aspire and which they in some measure attain mankind having laid the basis of safety proceed to erect a superstructure suitable to their views The consequence is various in different states even in different orders of men of the same community and the effect to every individual corresponds with his station It enables the statesman and the soldier to settle the forms of their different procedure it enables the practitioner in every profession to pursue his separate advantage it affords the man of pleasure a time for refinement and the speculative leisure for literary conversation or study  IN this scene matters that have little reference to the active pursuits of mankind are made subjects of enquiry and the exercise of sentiment and reason itself becomes a profession The songs of the bard the harangues of the statesman and the warrior the tradition and the story of ancient times are considered as the models or the earliest production of so many arts which it becomes the object of different professions to copy or to improve The works of fancy like the subjects of natural history are distinguished into classes and species the rules of every particular kind are distinctly collected and the library is stored like the warehouse with the finished manufacture of different arts who with the aids of the grammarian and the critic aspire each in his particular way to instruct the head or to move the heart  EVERY nation is a motley assemblage of different characters and contains under any political form some examples of that variety which the humours tempers and apprehensions of men so differently employed are likely to furnish Every profession has its point of honour and its system of manners the merchant his punctuality and fair dealing the statesman his capacity and address the man of society his good breeding and wit Every station has a carriage a dress a ceremonial by which it is distinguished and by which it suppresses the national character under that of the rank or of the individual  THIS description may be applied equally to Athens and Rome to London and Paris The rude or the simple observer would remark the variety he saw in the dwellings and in the occupations of different men not in the aspect of different nations He would find in the streets of the same city as great a diversity as in the territory of a separate people He could not pierce through the cloud that was gathered before him nor see how the tradesman mechanic or scholar of one country should differ from those of another But the native of every province can distinguish the foreigner and when he himself travels is struck with the aspect of a strange country the moment he passes the bounds of his own The air of the person the tone of the voice the idiom of language and the strain of conversation whether pathetic or languid gay or severe are no longer the same  MANY such differences may arise among polished nations from the effects of climate or from sources of fashion that are still more unaccountable and obscure but the principal distinctions on which we can rest are derived from the part a people are obliged to act in their national capacity from the objects placed in their view by the state or from the constitution of government which prescribing the terms of society to its subjects has a great influence in forming their apprehensions and habits  THE Roman people destined to acquire wealth by conquest and by the spoil of provinces the Carthaginians intent on the returns of merchandise and the produce of commercial settlements must have filled the streets of their several capitals with men of a different disposition and aspect The Roman laid hold of his sword when he wished to be great and the state found her armies prepared in the dwellings of her people The Carthaginian retired to his counter on a similar project and when the state was alarmed or had resolved on a war lent of his profits to purchase an army abroad  THE member of a republic and the subject of a monarchy must differ because they have different parts assigned to them by the forms of their country the one destined to live with his equals or by his personal talents and character to contend for preeminence the other born to a determinate station where any pretence to equality creates a confusion and where nought but precedence is studied Each when the institutions  of his country are mature may find in the laws a protection to his personal rights but those rights themselves are differently understood and with a different set of opinions give rise to a different temper of mind The republican must act in the state to sustain his pretensions he must join a party in order to be safe he must form one in order to be great The subject of monarchy refers to his birth for the honour he claims he waits on a court to shew his importance and holds out the ensigns of dependence and favour to gain him esteem with the public  IF national institutions calculated for the preservation of liberty instead of calling upon the citizen to act for himself and to maintain his rights should give a security requiring on his part no personal attention or effort this seeming perfection of government might weaken the bands of society and upon maxims of independence separate and estrange the different ranks it was meant to reconcile Neither the parties formed in republics nor the courtly assemblies which meet in monarchical governments could take place where the sense of a mutual dependence should cease to summon their members together The resorts for commerce might be frequented and mere amusement might be pursued in the croud while the private dwelling became a retreat for reserve averse to the trouble arising from regards and attentions which it might be part of the political creed to believe of no consequence and a point of honour to hold in contempt  THIS humour is not likely to grow either in republics or monarchies it belongs more properly  to a mixture of both where the administration of justice may be better secured where the subject is tempted to look for equality but where he finds only independence in its place and where he learns from a spirit of equality to hate the very distinctions to which on account of their real importance he pays a remarkable deference  IN either of the separate forms of republic or monarchy or in acting on the principles of either men are obliged to court their fellowcitizens and to employ parts and address to improve their fortunes or even to be safe They find in both a school for discernment and penetration but in the one are taught to overlook the merits of a private character for the sake of abilities that have weight with the public and in the other to overlook great and respectable talents for the sake of qualities engaging or pleasant in the scene of entertainment and private society They are obliged in both to adapt themselves with care to the fashion and manners of their country They find no place for caprice or singular humours The republican must be popular and the courtier polite The first must think himself well placed in every company the other must chuse his resorts and desire to be distinguished only where the society itself is esteemed With his inferiors he takes an air of protection and suffers in his turn the same air to be taken with himself It did not perhaps require in a Spartan who feared nothing but a failure in his duty who loved nothing but his friend and the state so constant a guard on himself to support his character as it frequently does in the subject of a monarchy to  adjust his expence and his fortune to the desires of his vanity and to appear in a rank as high as his birth or ambition can possibly reach  THERE is no particular in the mean time in which we are more frequently unjust than in applying to the individual the supposed character of his country or more frequently misled than in taking our notion of a people from the example of one or a few of their members It belonged to the constitution of Athens to have produced a Cleon and a Pericles but all the Athenians were not therefore like Cleon or Pericles Themistocles and Aristides lived in the same age the one advised what was profitable the other told his country what was just  SECT IV  The same subject continued  THE law of Nature with respect to nations is the same that it is with respect to individuals it gives to the collective body a right to preserve themselves to employ undisturbed the means of life to retain the fruits of labour to demand observance of stipulations and contracts In the case of violence it condemns the aggressor and establishes on the part of the injured the right of defence and a claim to retribution Its applications however admit of disputes and give rise to variety in the apprehension as well as the practice of mankind  NATIONS have agreed universally in distinguishing right from wrong in exacting the reparation of injuries by consent or by force They have always reposed in a certain degree on the faith of treaties but have acted as if force were the ultimate arbiter in all their disputes and the power to defend themselves the surest pledge of their safety Guided by these common apprehensions they have differed from one another not merely in points of form but in points of the greatest importance respecting the usage of war the effects of captivity and the rights of conquest and victory  WHEN a number of independent communities have been frequently involved in wars and have had their stated alliances and oppositions they adopt customs which they make the foundation of rules or of laws to be observed or alledged in all their mutual transactions Even in war itself they would follow a system and plead for the observance of forms in their very operations for mutual destruction  THE ancient states of Greece and Italy derived their manners in war from the nature of their republican government those of modern Europe from the influence of monarchy which by its prevalence in this part of the world has a great effect on nations even where it is not the form established Upon the maxims of this government we apprehend a distinction between the state and its members as that between the King and the people which renders war an operation of policy not of popular animosity While we strike at the public interest we would spare the private and we carry a respect and consideration for individuals which often stops the issues of blood in the ardour of victory and procures to the prisoner of war an hospitable reception in the very city which he came to destroy These practices are so well established that scarcely any provocation on the part of an enemy or any exigence of service can excuse a trespass on the supposed rules of humanity or save the leader who commits it from becoming an object of detestation and horror  TO this the general practice of the Greeks and the Romans was opposite They endeavoured to wound the state by destroying its members  by desolating its territory and by ruining the possessions of its subjects They granted quarter only to inslave or to bring the prisoner to a more solemn execution and an enemy when disarmed was for the most part either sold in the market or killed that he might never return to strengthen his party When this was the issue of war it was no wonder that battles were fought with desperation and that every fortress was defended to the last extremity The game of human life went upon a high stake and was played with a proportional zeal  THE term  barbarian  in this state of manners could not be employed by the Greeks or the Romans in that sense in which we use it to characterise a people regardless of commercial arts profuse of their own lives and of those of others vehement in their attachment to one society and implacable in their antipathy to another This in a great and shining part of their history was their own character as well as that of some other nations whom upon this very account we distinguish by the appellations of  barbarous  or  rude  IT has been observed that those celebrated nations are indebted for a great part of their estimation not to the matter of their history but to the manner in which it has been delivered and to the capacity of their historians and other writers Their story has been told by men who knew how to draw our attention on the proceedings of the understanding and of the heart more than on the detail of fact and who could exhibit characters to be admired and loved in the midst of actions which we should now universally hate or condemn  Like Homer the model of Grecian literature they could make us forget the horrors of a vindictive cruel and remorseless proceeding towards an enemy in behalf of the strenuous conduct the courage and vehement affections with which the hero maintained the cause of his friend and of his country  OUR manners are so different and the system upon which we regulate our apprehensions in many things so opposite that no less could make us endure the practice of ancient nations Were that practice recorded by the mere journalist who retains only the detail of events without throwing any light on the character of the actors who like the Tartar historian tells only what blood was spilt in the field and how many inhabitants were massacred in the city we should never have distinguished the Greeks from their barbarous neighbours nor have thought that the character of civility pertained even to the Romans till very late in their history and in the decline of their empire  IT would no doubt be pleasant to see the remarks of such a traveller as we sometimes send abroad to inspect the manners of mankind left unassisted by history to collect the character of the Greeks from the state of their country or from their practice in war  This country  he might say  compared to ours has an air of barrenness and desolation I saw upon the road troops of labourers who were employed in the fields but no where the habitations of the master and the landlord It was unsafe I was told to reside in the country and the people of every district  crouded into towns to find a place of defence It is indeed impossible that they can be more civilized till they have established some regular government and have courts of justice to hear their complaints At present every town nay I may say every village acts for itself and the greatest disorders prevail I was not indeed molested for you must know that they call themselves nations and do all their mischief under the pretence of war  I do not mean to take any of the liberties of travellers nor to vie with the celebrated author of the voyage to Lilliput but cannot help endeavouring to communicate what I felt on hearing them speak of their territory their armies their revenue treaties and alliances Only imagine the churchwardens and constables of Highgate or Hampstead turned statesmen and generals and you will have a tolerable conception of this singular country I passed through one state where the best house in the capital would not lodge the meanest of your labourers and where your very beggars would not chuse to dine with the King and yet they are thought a great nation and have no less than two kings I saw one of them but such a potentate he had scarcely cloaths to his back and for his Majesty's table he was obliged to go to the eatinghouse with his subjects They have not a single farthing of money and I was obliged to get food at the public expence there being none to be had in the market You will imagine that there must have been a service of plate and great attendance to wait upon the illustrious stranger but my fare was a mess of sorry pottage brought me by a naked slave  who left me to deal with it as I thought proper and even this I was in continual danger of having stolen from me by the children who are as vigilant to seize opportunities and as dextrous in snatching their food as any starved greyhound you ever saw The misery of the whole people in short as well as my own while I staid there was beyond description You would think that their whole attention were to torment themselves as much as they can they are even displeased with one of their kings for being well liked He had made a present while I was there of a cow to one favourite and of a waistcoat to another  Plutarch in the life of Agesilaus  and it was publicly said that this method of gaining friends was robbing the public My landlord told me very gravely that a man should come under no obligation that might weaken the love which he owes to his country nor form any personal attachment beyond the mere habit of living with his friend and of doing him a kindness when he can  I asked him once Why they did not for their own sakes enable their kings to assume a little more state Because says he we intend them the happiness of living with men When I found fault with their houses and said in particular that I was surprised they did not build better churches What would you be then says he if you found religion in stone walls This will suffice for a sample of our conversation and sententious as it was you may believe I did not stay long to profit by it  THE  are not quite so stupid  large square of a marketplace  tolerable buildings and I am told  have some barks and lighters employed in trade which they likewise upon occasion muster into a fleet like my Lord Mayor's shew But what pleases me most is that I am likely to get a passage from hence and bid farewell to this wretched country I have been at some pains to observe their cercmonies of religion and to pick up curiosities I have copied some inscriptions as you will see when you come to peruse my journal and will then judge whether I have met with enough to compensate the fatigues and bad entertainment to which I have submitted As for the people you will believe from the specimen I have given you that they could not be very engaging company though poor and dirty they still pretend to be proud and a fellow who is not worth a groat is above working for his livelihood They come abroad barefooted and without any cover to the head wrapt up in the coverlets under which you would imagine they had slept They throw all off and appear like so many naked cannibals when they go to violent sports and exercises at which they highly value feats of dexterity and strength Brawny limbs and muscular arms the faculty of sleeping out all nights of fasting long and of putting up with any kind of food are thought genteel accomplishments They have no settled government that I could learn sometimes the mob and sometimes the better sort do what they please they meet in great crouds in the  open air and seldom agree about any thing If a fellow has presumption enough and a loud voice he can make a great figure There was a tanner here some time ago who for a while carried every thing before him He censured so loudly what others had done and talked so big of what might be performed that he was sent out at last to make good his words and to curry the enemy instead of his leather  Thucydides lib Aristophanes  You will imagine perhaps that he was pressed for a recruit nohe was sent to command the army They are indeed seldom long of one mind except in their readiness to harass their neighbours They go out in bodies and rob pillage and murder whereever they come  So far may we suppose our traveller to have written and upon a recollection of the reputation which those nations have acquired at a distance he might have added perhaps  That he could not understand how scholars fine gentlemen and even women should combine to admire a people who so little resemble themselves  TO form a judgement of the character from which they acted in the field and in their competitions with neighbouring nations we must observe them at home They were bold and fearless in their civil dissensions ready to proceed to extremities and to carry their debates to the decision of force Individuals stood distinguished by their personal spirit and vigour not by the valuation of their estates or the rank of their birth They had a personal elevation founded on the sense of equality not of precedence The general of one campaign was during the next a private soldier and served  in the ranks They were solicitous to acquire bodily strength because in the use of their weapons battles were a trial of the soldier's strength as well as of the leader's conduct The remains of their statuary shews a manly grace an air of simplicity and ease which being frequent in nature were familiar to the artist The mind perhaps borrowed a confidence and force from the vigour and address of the body their eloquence and style bore a resemblance to the carriage of the person The understanding was chiefly cultivated in the practice of affairs The most respectable personages were obliged to mix with the croud and derived their degree of ascendency only from their conduct their eloquence and personal vigour They had no forms of expression to mark a ceremonious and guarded respect Invective proceeded to railing and the grossest terms were often employed by the most admired and accomplished orators Quarrelling had no rules but the immediate dictates of passion which ended in words of reproach in violence and blows They fortunately went always unarmed and to wear a sword in times of peace was among them the mark of a barbarian When they took arms in the divisions of faction the prevailing party supported itself by expelling their opponents by proscriptions and bloodshed The usurper endeavoured to maintain his station by the most violent and prompt executions He was opposed in his turn by conspiracies and assassinations in which the most respectable citizens were ready to use the dagger  SUCH was the character of their spirit in its occasional ferments at home and it burst commonly  with a suitable violence and force against their foreign rivals and enemies The amiable plea of humanity was little regarded by them in the operations of war Cities were razed or inslaved the captive sold mutilated or condemned to die  WHEN viewed on this side the ancient nations have but a sorry plea for esteem with the inhabitants of modern Europe who profess to carry the civilities of peace into the practice of war and who value the praise of indiscriminate lenity at a higher rate than even that of military prowess or the love of their country And yet they have in other respects merited and obtained our praise Their ardent attachment to their country their contempt of suffering and of death in its cause their manly apprehensions of personal independence which rendered every individual even under tottering establishments and imperfect laws the guardian of freedom to his fellowcitizens their activity of mind in short their penetration the ability of their conduct and force of their spirit have gained them the first rank among nations  IF their animosities were great their affections were proportionate they perhaps loved where we only pity and were stern and inexorable where we are not merciful but only irresolute After all the merit of a man is determined by his candour and generosity to his associates by his zeal for national objects and by his vigour in maintaining political rights not by moderation alone which proceeds frequently from indifference to national and public interests and which  serves to relax the nerves on which the force of a private as well as a public character depends  WHEN under the Macedonian and the Roman monarchies a nation came to be considered as the estate of a prince and the inhabitants of a province to be regarded as a lucrative property the possession of territory not the destruction of its people became the object of conquest The pacific citizen had little concern in the quarrels of sovereigns the violence of the soldier was restrained by discipline He fought because he was taught to carry arms and to obey he sometimes shed unnecessary blood in the ardour of victory but except in the case of civil wars had no passions to excite his animosity beyond the field and the day of battle Leaders judged of the objects of an enterprise and they arrested the sword when these were obtained  IN the modern nations of Europe where extent of territory admits of a distinction between the state and its subjects we are accustomed to think of the individual with compassion seldom of the public with zeal We have improved on the laws of war and on the lenitives which have been devised to soften its rigours we have mingled politeness with the use of the sword we have learned to make war under the stipulations of treaties and cartels and trust to the faith of an enemy whose ruin we meditate Glory is more successfully obtained by saving and protecting than by destroying the vanquished and the most amiable of all objects is in appearance attained the employing of force only for the obtaining of justice and for the preservation of national rights  THIS is perhaps the principal characteristic on which among modern nations we bestow the epithets of  civilized  or of  polished  But we have seen that it did not accompany the progress of arts among the Greeks nor keep pace with the advancement of policy literature and philosophy It did not await the returns of learning and politeness among the moderns it was found in early periods of our history and distinguished perhaps more than at present the manners of ages otherwise rude and undisciplined A King of France prisoner in the hands of his enemies was treated about four hundred years ago with as much distinction and courtesy as a crowned head in the like circumstances could possibly expect in this age of politeness  Hume's History of England  The Prince of Conde defeated and taken in the battle of Dreux slept at night in the same bed with his enemy the Duke of Guise  Davila    IF the moral of popular traditions and the taste of fabulous legends which are the production or entertainment of particular ages are likewise sure indications of their notions and characters we may presume that the foundation of what is now held to be the law of war and of nations was laid in the manners of Europe together with the sentiments which are expressed in the tales of chivalry and of gallantry Our system of war differs not more from that of the Greeks than the favourite characters of our early romance differed  from those of the Iliad and of every ancient poem The hero of the Greek fable endued with superior force courage and address takes every advantage of an enemy to kill with safety to himself and actuated by a desire of spoil or by a principle of revenge is never stayed in his progress by interruptions of remorse or compassion Homer who of all poets knew best how to exhibit the emotions of a vehement affection seldom attempts to excite commiseration Hector falls unpitied and his body is insulted by every Greek  OUR modern fable or romance on the contrary generally couples an object of pity weak oppressed and defenceless with an object of admiration brave generous and victorious or sends the hero abroad in search of mere danger and of occasions to prove his valour Charged with the maxims of a refined courtesy to be observed even towards an enemy and of a scrupulous honour which will not suffer him to take any advantages by artifice or surprise indifferent to spoil he contends only for renown and employs his valour to rescue the distressed and to protect the innocent If victorious he is made to rise above nature as much in his generosity and gentleness as in his military prowess and valour  IT may be difficult upon stating this contrast between the system of ancient and modern fable to assign among nations equally rude equally addicted to war and equally fond of military glory the origin of apprehensions on the point of honour so different and so opposite The hero of Greek poetry proceeds on the maxims of animosity and  hostile passion His maxims in war are like those which prevail in the woods of America They require him to be brave but they allow him to practise against his enemy every sort of deception The hero of modern romance professes a contempt of stratagem as well as of danger and unites in the same person characters and dispositions seemingly opposite ferocity with gentleness and the love of blood with sentiments of tenderness and pity  THE system of chivalry when completely formed proceeded on a marvellous respect and veneration to the fair sex on forms of combat established and on a supposed junction of the heroic and sanctified character The formalities of the duel and a kind of judicial challenge were known among the ancient Celtic nations of Europe The Germans even in their native forests paid a kind of devotion to the female sex The Christian religion injoined meekness and compassion to barbarous ages These different principles combined together may have served as the foundation of a system in which courage was directed by religion and love and the warlike and gentle were united together When the characters of the hero and the saint were mixed the mild spirit of Christianity though often turned into venom by the bigotry of opposite parties though it could not always subdue the ferocity of the warrior nor suppress the admiration of courage and force may have confirmed the apprehensions of men in what was to be held meritorious and splendid in the conduct of their quarrels  IN the early and traditionary history of the Greeks and the Romans rapes were assigned as the most frequent occasions of war and the sexes were no doubt at all times equally important to each other The enthusiasm of love is most powerful in the neighbourhood of Asia and Africa and beauty as a possession was probably more valued by the countrymen of Homer than it was by those of Amadis de Gaul or by the authors of modern gallantry  What wonder  says the old Priam when Helen appeared  that nations should contend for the possession of so much beauty  This beauty indeed was possessed by different lovers a subject on which the modern hero had many refinements and seemed to soar in the clouds He adored at a respectful distance and employed his valour to captivate the admiration not to gain the possession of his mistress A cold and unconquerable chastity was set up as an idol to be worshipped in the toils the sufferings and the combats of the hero and the lover  THE feudal establishments by the high rank to which they elevated certain families no doubt greatly favoured this romantic system Not only the lustre of a noble descent but the stately castle beset with battlements and towers served to inflame the imagination and create a veneration for the daughter and the sister of gallant chiefs whose point of honour it was to be inaccessible and chaste and who could perceive no merit but that of the highminded and the brave nor be approached in any other accents than those of gentleness and respect  WHAT was originally singular in these apprehensions was by the writer of romance turned to extravagance and under the title of chivalry was offered as a model of conduct even in common affairs the fortunes of nations were directed by gallantry and human life on its greatest occasions became a scene of affectation and folly Warriors went forth to realize the legends they had studied princes and leaders of armies dedicated their most serious exploits to a real or to a fancied mistress  BUT whatever was the origin of notions often so lofty and so ridiculous we cannot doubt of their lasting effects on our manners The point of honour the prevalence of gallantry in our conversations and on our theatres many of the opinions which the vulgar apply even to the conduct of war their notion that the leader of an army being offered battle upon equal terms is dishonoured by declining it are undoubtedly remains of this antiquated system and chivalry uniting with the genius of our policy has probably suggested those particularities in the law of nations by which modern states are distinguished from the ancient And if our rule in measuring degrees of politeness and civilization is to be taken from hence or from the advancement of commercial arts we shall be found to have greatly excelled any of the celebrated nations of antiquity  PART FIFTH  Of the Decline of Nations  SECT I  Of supposed National Eminence and of the Vicissitudes of Human Affairs  NO nation is so unfortunate as to think itself inferior to the rest of mankind few are even willing to put up with the claim to equality The greater part having chosen themselves as at once the judges and the models of what is excellent in their kind are first in their own opinion and give to others consideration or eminence so far only as they approach to their own condition One nation is vain of the personal character or of the learning of a few of its members another of its policy its wealth its tradesmen its gardens and its buildings and they who have nothing to boast are vain because  they are ignorant The Russians before the reign of Peter the Great thought themselves possessed of every national honour and held the  Nemei  or  dumb Nations  the name which they bestowed on their western neighbours of Europe in a proportional degree of contempt  Strahlenberg  The map of the world in China was a square plate the greater part of which was occupied by the provinces of this great empire leaving on its skirts a few obscure corners into which the wretched remainder of mankind were supposed to be driven  If you have not the use of our letters nor the knowledge of our books  said the learned Chinese to the European missionary  what literature or what science can you have  Gemelli Carceri    THE term  polished  if we may judge from its etymology originally referred to the state of nations in respect to their laws and government In its later application it refers no less to their proficiency in the liberal and mechanical arts in literature and in commerce But whatever may be its applications it appears that if there were a name still more respectable than this every nation even the most barbarous or the most corrupted would assume it and bestow its reverse where they conceived a dislike or apprehended a difference The names of  alien  or  foreigner  are seldom pronounced without some degree of intended reproach That of  barbarian  in use with one arrogant people and that of  gentil  with another only served to distinguish the stranger whose language and pedigree differed from theirs  EVEN where we pretend to found our opinions on reason and to justify our preference of one nation to another we frequently bestow our esteem on circumstances which do not relate to national character and which have little tendency to promote the welfare of mankind Conquest or great extent of territory however peopled and great wealth however distributed or employed are titles upon which we indulge our own and the vanity of other nations as we do that of private men on the score of their fortunes and honours We even sometimes contend whose capital is the most overgrown whose king has the most absolute power and at whose court the bread of the subject is consumed in the most senseless riot These indeed are the notions of vulgar minds but it is impossible to determine how far the notions of vulgar minds may lead mankind  THERE have certainly been very few examples of states who have by arts or policy improved the original dispositions of human nature or endeavoured by wise and effectual precautions to prevent its corruption Affection and force of mind which are the band and the strength of communities were the inspiration of God and original attributes in the nature of man The wisest policy of nations except in a very few instances has tended we may suspect rather to maintain the peace of society and to repress the external effects of bad passions than to strengthen the disposition of the heart itself to justice and goodness It has tended by introducing a variety of arts to exercise the ingenuity of men and by engaging them in a variety of pursuits inquiries  and studies to inform but frequently to corrupt the mind It has tended to furnish matter of distinction and vanity and by incumbering the individual with new subjects of personal care to substitute the anxiety he entertains for himself instead of the confidence and the affection he should entertain for his fellowcreatures  WHETHER this suspicion be just or no we are come to point at circumstances tending to verify or to disprove it and if to understand the real felicity of nations be of importance it is certainly so likewise to know what are those weaknesses and those vices by which men not only mar this felicity but in one age forfeit all the external advantages they had gained in a former  THE wealth the aggrandizement and power of nations are commonly the effects of virtue the loss of these advantages is often a consequence of vice  WERE we to suppose men to have succeeded in the discovery and application of every art by which states are preserved and governed to have attained by efforts of wisdom and magnanimity the admired establishments and advantages of a civilized and flourishing people the subsequent part of their history containing according to vulgar apprehension a full display of those fruits in maturity of which they had till then carried only the blossom and the first formation should still more than the former merit our attention and excite our admiration  THE event however has not corresponded to this expectation The virtues of men have shone most during their struggles not after the attainment of their ends Those ends themselves though attained by virtue are frequently the causes of corruption and vice Mankind in aspiring to national felicity have substituted arts which increase their riches instead of those which improve their nature They have entertained admiration of themselves under the titles of  civilized  and of  polished  where they should have been affected with shame and even where they have for a while acted on maxims tending to raise to invigorate and to preserve the national character they have sooner or later been diverted from their object and fallen a prey to misfortune or to the neglects which prosperity itself had encouraged  WAR which furnishes mankind with a principal occupation of their restless spirit serves by the variety of its events to diversify their fortunes While it opens to one tribe or society the way to eminence and leads to dominion it brings another to subjection and closes the scene of their national efforts The celebrated rivalship of Carthage and Rome was in both parties the natural exercise of an ambitious spirit impatient of opposition or even of equality The conduct and the fortune of leaders held the balance for some time in suspence but to which ever side it had inclined a great nation was to fall a seat of empire and of policy was to be removed from its place and it was then to be determined whether  the Syriac or the Latin should contain the erudition that was in future ages to occupy the studies of the learned  STATES have been thus conquered from abroad before they gave any signs of internal decay even in the midst of prosperity and in the period of their greatest ardour for national objects Athens in the height of her ambition and of her glory received a fatal wound in striving to extend her maritime power beyond the Grecian seas And nations of every description formidable by their rude ferocity respected for their discipline and military experience when advancing as well as when declining in their strength fell a prey by turns to the ambition and arrogant spirit of the Romans Such examples may excite and alarm the jealousy and caution of states the presence of similar dangers may exercise the talents of politicians and statesmen but mere reverses of fortune are the common materials of history and must long since have ceased to create our surprise  DID we find that nations advancing from small beginnings and arrived at the possession of arts which lead to dominion became secure of their advantages in proportion as they were qualified to gain them that they proceeded in a course of uninterrupted felicity till they were broke by external calamities and that they retained their force till a more fortunate or vigorous power arose to depress them the subject in speculation could not be attended with many difficulties nor give rise to many reflections But when we observe among  nations a kind of spontaneous return to obscurity and weakness when in spite of perpetual admonitions of the danger they run they suffer themselves to be subdued in one period by powers which could not have entered into competition with them in a former and by forces which they had often baffled and despised the subject becomes more curious and its explanation more difficult  THE fact itself is known in a variety of different examples The empire of Asia was more than once transferred from the greater to the inferior power The states of Greece once so warlike felt a relaxation of their vigour and yielded the ascendant they had disputed with the monarchs of the east to the forces of an obscure principality become formidable in a few years and raised to eminence under the conduct of a single man The Roman empire which stood alone for ages which had brought every rival under subjection and saw no power from whom a competition could be feared sunk at last before an artless and contemptible enemy Abandoned to inroad to pillage and at last to conquest on her frontier she decayed in all her extremities and shrunk on every side Her territory was dismembered and whole provinces gave way like branches fallen down with age not violently torn by superior force The spirit with which Marius had baffled and repelled the attacks of barbarians in a former age the civil and military force with which the consul and his legions had extended this empire were now no more The Roman greatness doomed to sink as it rose by slow degrees was impaired in every encounter  It was reduced to its original dimensions within the compass of a single city and depending for its preservation on the fortune of a siege it was extinguished at a blow and the brand which had filled the world with its flames sunk like a taper in the socket  SUCH appearances have given rise to a general apprehension that the progress of societies to what we call the heights of national greatness is not more natural than their return to weakness and obscurity is necessary and unavoidable The images of youth and of old age are applied to nations and communities like single men are supposed to have a period of life and a length of thread which is spun by the fates in one part uniform and strong in another weakened and shattered by use to be cut when the destined aera is come and to make way for a renewal of the emblem in the case of those who arise in succession Carthage being so much older than Rome had felt her decay says Polybius so much the sooner and the survivor too he foresaw carried in her bosom the seeds of mortality  THE image indeed is apposite and the history of mankind renders the application familiar But it must be obvious that the case of nations and that of individuals are very different The human frame has a general course it has in every individual a frail contexture and a limited duration it is worn by exercise and exhausted by a repetition of its functions But in a society whose constituent members are renewed in every generation where the race seems to enjoy perpetual  youth and accumulating advantages we cannot by any parity of reason expect to find imbecilities connected with mere age and length of days  THE subject is not new and reflections will croud upon every reader The notions in the mean time which we entertain even in speculation upon a subject so important cannot be entirely fruitless to mankind and however little the labours of the speculative may influence the conduct of men one of the most pardonable errors a writer can commit is to believe that he is about to do a great deal of good But leaving the care of effects to others we proceed to consider the grounds of inconstancy among mankind the sources of internal decay and the ruinous corruptions to which nations are liable in the supposed condition of accomplished civility  SECT II  Of the Temporary Efforts and Relaxations of the National Spirit  FROM what we have already observed on the general characteristics of human nature it has appeared that man is not made for repose In him every amiable and respectable quality is an active power and every subject of commendation an effort If his errors and his crimes are the movements of an active being his virtues and his happiness consist likewise in the employment of his mind and all the lustre which he casts around him to captivate or engage the attention of his fellowcreatures like the flame of a meteor shines only while his motion continues the moments of rest and of obscurity are the same We know that the tasks assigned him frequently may exceed as well as come short of his powers that he may be agitated too much as well as too little but cannot ascertain a precise medium between the situations in which he would be harassed and those in which he would fall into languor We know that he may be employed on a great variety of subjects which occupy different passions and that in consequence of habit he becomes reconciled to very different scenes All we can determine in general  is that whatever be the subjects with which he is engaged the frame of his nature requires him to be occupied and his happiness requires him to be just  WE are now to inquire why nations cease to be eminent and why societies which have drawn the attention of mankind by great examples of magnanimity conduct and national success should sink from the height of their honours and yield in one age the palm which they had won in a former Many reasons will probably occur One may be taken from the fickleness and inconstancy of mankind who become tired of their pursuits and exertions even while the occasions that gave rise to those pursuits in some measure continue Another from the change of situations and the removal of objects which served to excite their spirit  THE public safety and the relative interests of states political establishments the pretensions of party commerce and arts are subjects which engage the attention of nations The advantages gained in some of these particulars determine the degree of national prosperity The ardour and vigour with which they are at any one time pursued is the measure of a national spirit When those objects cease to animate nations may be said to languish when they are during any considerable time neglected states must decline and their people degenerate  IN the most forward enterprising inventive and industrious nations this spirit is fluctuating  and they who continue longest to gain advantages or to preserve them have periods of remissness as well as of ardour The desire of public safety is at all times a powerful motive of conduct but it operates most when combined with occasional passions when provocations inflame when successes encourage or mortifications exasperate  A WHOLE people like the individuals of whom they are composed act under the influence of temporary humours sanguine hopes or vehement animosities They are disposed at one time to enter on national struggles with vehemence at another to drop them from mere lassitude and disgust In their civil debates and contentions at home they are occasionally ardent or remiss Epidemical passions arise or subside on trivial as well as important grounds Parties are ready at one time to take their names and the pretence of their oppositions from mere caprice or accident at another time they suffer the most serious occasions to pass in silence If a vein of literary genius be casually opened or a new subject of disquisition be started real or pretended discoveries suddenly multiply and every conversation is inquisitive and animated If a new source of wealth be found or a prospect of conquest be offered the imaginations of men are inflamed and whole quarters of the globe are suddenly engaged in ruinous or in successful adventures  COULD we recall the spirit that was exerted or enter into the views that were entertained by our ancestors when they burst like a deluge from their ancient seats and poured into the Roman  Empire we should probably after their first successes at least find a ferment in the minds of men for which no attempt was too arduous no difficulties insurmountable  THE subsequent ages of enterprise in Europe were those in which the alarm of enthusiasm was rung and the followers of the cross invaded the East to plunder a country and to recover a sepulchre those in which the people in different states contended for freedom and assaulted the fabric of civil or religious usurpation that in which having found means to cross the Atlantic and to double the Cape of Good Hope the inhabitants of one half the world were let loose on the other and parties from every quarter wading in blood and at the expence of every crime and of every danger traversed the earth in search of gold  EVEN the weak and the remiss are roused to enterprise by the contagion of such remarkable ages and states which have not in their form the principles of a continued exertion either favourable or adverse to the welfare of mankind may have paroxysms of ardour and a temporary appearance of national vigour In the case of such nations indeed the returns of moderation are but a relapse to obscurity and the presumption of one age is turned to dejection in that which succeeds  BUT in the case of states that are fortunate in their domestic policy even madness itself may in the result  of violent convulsions subside into  wisdom and a people return to their ordinary mood cured of their follies and wiser by experience or with talents improved in conducting the very scenes which frenzy had opened they may then appear best qualified to pursue with success the object of nations Like the ancient republics immediately after some alarming sedition or like the kingdom of Great Britain at the close of its civil wars they retain the spirit of activity which was recently awakened and are equally vigorous in every pursuit whether of policy learning or arts From having appeared on the brink of ruin they pass to the greatest prosperity  MEN engage in pursuits with degrees of ardour not proportioned to the importance of their object When they are stated in opposition or joined in confederacy they only wish for pretences to act They forget in the heat of their animosities the subject of their controversy or they seek in their formal reasonings concerning it only a disguise for their passions When the heart is inflamed no consideration can repress its ardour when its fervour subsides no reasoning can excite and no eloquence awaken its former emotions  THE continuance of emulation among states must depend on the degree of equality by which their forces are balanced or on the incentives by which either party or all are urged to continue their struggles Long intermissions of war suffer equally in every period of civil society the military spirit to languish The reduction of  Athens by Lysander struck a fatal blow at the institutions of Lycurgus and the quiet possession of Italy happily perhaps for mankind had almost put an end to the military progress of the Romans After some years of repose Hannibal found Italy unprepared for his onset and the Romans in a disposition likely to drop on the banks of the Po that martial ambition which being roused by the sense of a new danger afterwards carried them to the Euphrates and the Rhine  STATES even distinguished for military prowess sometimes lay down their arms from lassitude and are weary of fruitless contentions but if they maintain the station of independent communities they will have frequent occasions to recall and exert their vigour Even under popular governments men sometimes drop the consideration of their political rights and appear at times remiss or supine but if they have reserved the power to defend themselves the intermission of its exercise cannot be of long duration Political rights when neglected are always invaded and alarms from this quarter must frequently come to renew the attention of parties The love of learning and of arts may change its pursuits or droop for a season but while men are possessed of freedom and while the exercises of ingenuity are not superseded the public may proceed at different times with unequal fervour but its progress is seldom altogether discontinued or the advantages gained in one age are seldom entirely lost to the following  IF we would find the causes of final corruption we must examine those revolutions of state that remove or withhold the objects of every ingenious study or liberal pursuit that deprive the citizen of occasions to act as the member of a public that crush his spirit that debase his sentiments and disqualify his mind for affairs  SECT III  Of Relaxations in the National Spirit incident to Polished Nations  IMPROVING nations in the course of their advancement have to struggle with foreign enemies to whom they bear an extreme animosity and with whom in many conflicts they contend for their existence as a people In certain periods too they feel in their domestic policy inconveniencies and grievances which beget an eager impatience and they apprehend reformations and new establishments from which they have sanguine hopes of national happiness In early ages every art is imperfect and susceptible of many improvements The first principles of every science are yet secrets to be discovered and to be successively published with applause and triumph  WE may fancy to ourselves that in ages of progress the human race like scouts gone abroad on the discovery of fertile lands having the world open before them are presented at every step with the appearance of novelty They enter on every new ground with expectation and joy They engage in every enterprise with the ardour of men who believe they are going to arrive at national felicity and permanent glory and forget past disappointments amidst the hopes of future success  From mere ignorance rude minds are intoxicated with every passion and partial to their own condition and to their own pursuits they think that every scene is inferior to that in which they are placed Roused alike by success and by misfortune they are sanguine ardent and precipitant and leave to the more knowing ages which succeed them monuments of imperfect skill and of rude execution in every art but they leave likewise the marks of a vigorous and ardent spirit which their successors are not always qualified to sustain or to imitate  THIS may be admitted perhaps as a fair description of prosperous societies at least during certain periods of their progress The spirit with which they advance may be unequal in different ages and may have its paroxysms and intermissions arising from the inconstancy of human passions and from the casual appearance or removal of occasions that excite them But does this spirit which for a time continues to carry on the project of civil and commercial arts find a natural pause in the termination of its own pursuits May the business of civil society be accomplished and may the occasion of farther exertion be removed Do continued disappointments reduce sanguine hopes and familiarity with objects blunt the edge of novelty Does experience itself cool the ardour of the mind May the society be again compared to the individual And may it be suspected although the vigour of a nation like that of a natural body does not waste by a physical decay that yet it may sicken for want of exercise and die in the close of its own exertions May societies in the completion of  all their designs like men in years who disregard the amusements and are insensible to the passions of youth become cold and indifferent to objects that used to animate in a ruder age And may a polished community be compared to a man who having executed his plan built his house and made his settlement who having in short exhausted the charms of every subject and wasted all his ardour sinks into languor and listless indifference If so we have found at least another simile to our purpose But it is probable that here too the resemblance is imperfect and the inference that would follow like that of most arguments drawn from analogy tends rather to amuse the fancy than to give any real information on the subject to which it refers  THE materials of human art are never entirely exhausted and the applications of industry are never at an end The national ardour is not at any particular time proportioned to the occasion there is for activity nor curiosity to the extent of subject that remains to be studied  THE ignorant and the artless to whom objects of science are new and who are worst furnished with the conveniencies of life instead of being more active and more curious are commonly more quiescent and less inquisitive than the knowing and the polished When we compare the particulars which occupy mankind in their rude and in their polished condition they will be found greatly multiplied and enlarged in the last The questions we have put however deserve to be answered and if in the advanced ages of society we do not find the objects of human  pursuit removed or greatly diminished we may find them at least changed and in estimating the national spirit we may find a negligence in one part but ill compensated by the growing attention which is paid to another  IT is true in general that in all our pursuits there is a termination of trouble and a point of repose to which we aspire We would remove this inconvenience or gain that advantage that our labours may cease When I have conquered Italy and Sicily say Pyrrhus I shall then enjoy my repose This termination is proposed in our national as well as in our personal exertions and in spite of frequent experience to the contrary is considered at a distance as the height of felicity But nature has wisely in most particulars baffled our project and placed no where within our reach this visionary blessing of absolute ease The attainment of one end is but the beginning of a new pursuit and the discovery of one art is but a prolongation of the thread by which we are conducted to further inquiries and only hope to escape from the labyrinth  AMONG the occupations that may be enumerated as tending to exercise the invention and to cultivate the talents of men are the pursuits of accommodation and wealth including all the different contrivances which serve to increase manufactures and to perfect the mechanical arts But it must be owned that as the materials of commerce may continue to be accumulated withou  any determinate limit so the arts which are ap…plied to improve them may admit of perpetua  refinements No measure of fortune or degree  skill is found to diminish the supposed necessities of human life refinement and plenty foster new desires while they furnish the means or practise the methods to gratify them  IN the result of commercial arts inequalities of fortune are greatly increased and the majority of every people are obliged by necessity or at least strongly incited by ambition and avarice to employ every talent they possess After a history of some thousand years employed in manufacture and commerce the inhabitants of China are still the most laborious and industrious of any people on the surface of the earth  SOME part of this observation may be extended to the elegant and literary arts They too have their materials which cannot be exhausted and proceed from desires which cannot be satiated But the respect paid to literary merit is fluctuating and matter of transient fashion When learned productions accumulate the acquisition of knowledge occupies the time that might be bestowed on invention The object of mere learning is attained with moderate or inferior talents and the growing list of pretenders diminishes the lustre of the few who are eminent When we only mean to learn what others have taught it is probable that even our knowledge will be less than that of our masters Great names continue to be repeated with admiration after we have ceased to examine the foundations of our praise and new pretenders are rejected not because they fall short of their predecessors but because they do not excel them or because in reality we have without examination taken for granted the merit of the first and cannot judge of either  AFTER libraries are furnished and every path of ingenuity is occupied we are in proportion to our admiration of what is already done prepossessed against farther attempts We become students and admirers instead of rivals and substitute the knowledge of books instead of the inquisitive or animated spirit in which they were written  THE commercial and lucrative arts may continue to prosper but they gain an ascendant at the expence of other pursuits The desire of profit stifles the love of perfection Interest cools the imagination and hardens the heart and recommending employments in proportion as they are lucrative and certain in their gains it drives ingenuity and ambition itself to the counter and the workshop  BUT apart from these considerations the separation of professions while it seems to promise improvement of skill and is actually the cause why the productions of every art become more perfect as commerce advances yet in its termination and ultimate effects serves in some measure to break the bands of society to substitute form in place of ingenuity and to withdraw individuals from the common scene of occupation on which the sentiments of the heart and the mind are most happily employed  UNDER the  distinction  of callings by which the members of polished society are separated from each other every individual is supposed to possess his species of talent or his peculiar skill  in which the others are confessedly ignorant and society is made to consist of parts of which none is animated with the spirit of society itself  We see in the same persons  said Pericles  an equal attention to private and to public affairs and in men who have turned to separate professions a competent knowledge of what relates to the community for we alone consider those who are inattentive to the state as perfectly insignificant  This encomium on the Athenians was probably offered under an apprehension that the contrary was likely to be charged by their enemies or might soon take place It happened accordingly that the business of state as well as of war came to be worse administred at Athens when these as well as other applications became the objects of separate professions and the history of this people abundantly shewed that men ceased to be citizens even to be good poets and orators in proportion as they came to be distinguished by the profession of these and other separate crafts  ANIMALS lefs honoured than we have sagacity enough to procure their food and to find the means of their solitary pleasures but it is reserved for man to consult to persuade to oppose to kindle in the society of his fellowcreatures and to lose the sense of his personal interest or safety in the ardour of his friendships and his oppositions  WHEN we are involved in any of the divisions into which mankind are separated under the denominations of a country a tribe or an order of men any way affected by common interests and guided by communicating passions the mind  recognises its natural station the sentiments of the heart and the talents of the understanding find their natural exercise Wisdom vigilance fidelity and fortitude are the characters requisite in such a scene and the qualities which it tends to improve  IN simple or barbarous ages when nations are weak and beset with enemies the love of a country of a party or a faction are the same The public is a knot of friends and its enemies are the rest of mankind Death or slavery are the ordinary evils which they are concerned to ward off victory and dominion the objects to which they aspire Under the sense of what they may suffer from foreign invasions it is one object in every prosperous society to increase its force and to extend its limits In proportion as this object is gained security increases They who possess the interior districts remote from the frontier are unused to alarms from abroad They who are placed on the extremities remote from the seats of government are unused to hear of political interests and the public becomes an object perhaps too extensive for the conceptions of either They enjoy the protection of its laws or of its armies and they boast of its splendor and its power but the glowing sentiments of public affection which in small states mingle with the tenderness of the parent and the lover of the friend and the companion merely by having their object enlarged lose great part of their force  THE manners of rude nations require to be reformed Their foreign quarrels and domestic dissensions are the operations of extreme and sanguinary  passions A state of greater tranquility hath many happy effects But if nations pursue the plan of enlargement and pacification till their members can no longer apprehend the common ties of society nor be engaged by affection in the cause of their country they must err on the opposite side and by leaving too little to agitate the spirits of men bring on ages of languor if not of decay  THE members of a community may in this manner like the inhabitants of a conquered province be made to lose the sense of every connection but that of kindred or neighbourhood and have no common affairs to transact but those of trade Connections indeed or transactions in which probity and friendship may still take place but in which the national spirit whose ebbs and flows we are now considering cannot be exerted  WHAT we observe however on the tendency of enlargement to loosen the bands of political union cannot be applied to nations who being originally narrow never greatly extended their limits nor to those who in a rude state had already the extension of a great kingdom  IN territories of considerable extent subject to one government and possessed of freedom the national union in rude ages is extremely imperfect Every district forms a separate party and the descendents of different families are opposed to one another under the denomination of  tribes  or of  clans  they are seldom brought to act with a steady concert their feuds and animosities give more frequently the appearance of so many nations  at war than of a people united by connections of policy They acquire a spirit however in their private divisions and in the midst of a disorder otherwise hurtful of which the force on many occasions redounds to the power of the state  WHATEVER be the national extent civil order and regular government are advantages of the greatest importance but it does not follow that every arrangement made to obtain these ends and which may in the making exercise and cultivate the best qualities of men is therefore of a nature to produce permanent effects and to secure the preservation of that national spirit from which it arose  WE have reason to dread the political refinements of ordinary men when we consider that repose or inaction itself is in a great measure their object and that they would frequently model their governments not merely to prevent injustice and error but to prevent agitation and bustle and by the barriers they raise against the evil actions of men would prevent them from acting at all Every dispute of a free people in the opinion of such politicians amounts to disorder and a breach of the national peace What heartburnings What delay to affairs What want of secrecy and dispatch What defect of police Men of superior genius sometimes seem to imagine that the vulgar have no title to act or to think A great prince is pleased to ridicule the precaution by which judges in a free country are confined to the strict interpretation of law  Memoirs of Brandenburg    WE easily learn to contract our opinions of what men may in consistence with public order be safely permitted to do The agitations of a republic and the licence of its members strike the subjects of monarchy with aversion and disgust The freedom with which the European is left to traverse the streets and the fields would appear to a Chinese a sure prelude to confusion and anarchy  Can men behold their superior and not tremble Can they converse without a precise and written ceremonial What hopes of peace if the streets are not barricaded at an hour What wild disorder if men are permitted in any thing to do what they please  IF the precautions which men thus take against each other be necessary to repress their crimes and do not arise from a corrupt ambition or from cruel jealousy in their rulers the proceeding itself must be applauded as the best remedy of which the vices of men will admit The viper must be held at a distance and the tyger chained But if a rigorous policy applied to enslave not to restrain from crimes has an actual tendency to corrupt the manners and to extinguish the spirit of nations if its severities be applied to terminate the agitations of a free people not to remedy their corruptions if forms be often applauded as salutary because they tend merely to silence the voice of mankind or be condemned as pernicious because they allow this voice to be heard we may expect that many of the boasted improvements of civil society will be mere devices to lay the political spirit at rest and will chain up the active virtues more than the restless disorders of men  IF to any people it be the avowed object of policy in all its internal refinements to secure the person and the property of the subject without any regard to his political character the constitution indeed may be free but its members may likewise become unworthy of the freedom they possess and unfit to preserve it The effects of such a constitution may be to immerse all orders of men in their separate pursuits of pleasure which they may now enjoy with little disturbance or of gain which they may preserve without any attention to the commonwealth  IF this be the end of political struggles the design when executed in securing to the individual his estate and the means of subsistence may put an end to the exercise of those very virtues that were required in conducting its execution A man who in concert with his fellowsubjects contends with usurpation in defence of his estate or his person may find an exertion of great generosity and of a vigorous spirit but he who under political establishments supposed to be fully confirmed betakes him because he is safe to the mere enjoyment of fortune has in fact turned to a source of corruption the very advantages which the virtues of the other procured Individuals in certain ages derive their protection chiefly from the strength of the party to which they adhere but in times of corruption they flatter themselves that they may continue to derive from the public that safety which in former ages they must have owed to their own vigilance and spirit to the warm attachment of their friends and to the exercise of every talent which could  render them respected feared or beloved In one period therefore mere circumstances serve to excite the spirit and to preserve the manners of men in another great wisdom and zeal for the good of mankind on the part of their leaders are required for the same purposes  ROME it may be thought did not die of a lethargy nor perish by the remission of her political ardours at home Her distemper appeared of a nature more violent and acute Yet if the virtues of Cato and of Brutus found an exercise in the dying hour of the republic the neutrality and the cautious retirement of Atticus found its security in the same tempestuous season and the great body of the people lay undisturbed below the current of a storm by which the superior ranks of men were destroyed In the minds of the people the sense of a public was defaced and even the animosity of faction had subsided they only could share in the commotion who were the soldiers of a legion or the partisans of a leader But this state fell not into obscurity for want of eminent men If at the time of which we speak we look only for a few names distinguished in the history of mankind there is no period at which the list was more numerous But those names became distingished in the contest for dominion not in the exercise of equal rights the people was corrupted the empire of the known world stood in need of a master  REPUBLICAN governments in general are in hazard of ruin from the ascendant of particular factions and from the mutinous spirit of a populace who being corrupted are no longer fit to  share in the administration of state But under other establishments where liberty may be more successfully attained if men are corrupted the national vigour declines from the abuse of that very security which is procured by the supposed perfection of public order  A distribution of power and office an execution of law by which mutual incroachments and molestations are brought to an end by which the person and the property are without friends without cabal without obligation perfectly secured to individuals does honour to the genius of a nation and could not have been fully established without those exertions of understanding and integrity those trials of a resolute and vigorous spirit which adorn the annals of a people and leave to future ages a subject of just admiration and applause But if we suppose that the end is attained and that men no longer act in the enjoyment of liberty from liberal sentiments or with a view to the preservation of public manners if individuals think themselves secure without any attention or effort of their own this boasted advantage may be found only to give them an opportunity of enjoying at leisure the conveniencies and necessaries of life or in the language of Cato teach them to value their houses their villas their statues and their pictures at a higher rate than they do the republic They may be found to grow tired in secret of a free constitution of which they never cease to boast in their conversation and which they always neglect in their conduct  THE dangers to liberty are not the subject of our present consideration but they can never be greater from any cause than they are from the supposed remissness of a people to whose personal vigour every constitution as it owed its establishment so must continue to owe its preservation Nor is this blessing ever less secure than it is in the possession of men who think that they enjoy it in safety and who therefore consider the public only as it presents to their avarice a number of lucrative employments for the sake of which they may sacrifice those very rights which render themselves objects of management or consideration  FROM the tendency of these reflections then it should appear that a national spirit is frequently transient not on account of any incurable distemper in the nature of mankind but on account of their voluntary neglects and corruptions This spirit subsisted solely perhaps in the execution of a few projects entered into for the acquisition of territory or wealth it comes like a useless weapon to be laid aside after its end is attained  ORDINARY establishments terminate in a relaxation of vigour and are ineffectual to the preservation of states because they lead mankind to rely on their arts instead of their virtues and to mistake for an improvement of human nature a mere accession of accommodation or of riches Institutions that fortify the mind inspire courage and promote national felicity can never tend to national ruin  IS it not possible amidst our admiration of arts to find some place for these Let statesmen who are intrusted with the government of nations reply for themselves It is their business to shew whether they climb into stations of eminence merely to display a passion for interest which they had better indulge in obscurity and whether they have capacity to understand the happiness of a people the conduct of whose affairs they are so willing to undertake  SECT IV  The same subject continued  MEN frequently while they study to improve their fortunes neglect themselves and while they reason for their country forget the considerations that most deserve their attention Numbers riches and the other resources of war are highly important▪ but nations consist of men▪ and a nation consisting of degenerate and cowardly men is weak a nation consisting of vigorous publicspirited and resolute men is strong The resources of war where other advantages are equal may decide a contest but the resources of war in hands that cannot employ them are of no avail  VIRTUE is a necessary constituent of national strength capacity and a vigorous understanding are no less necessary to sustain the fortune of states Both are improved by discipline and by the exercises in which men are engaged We despise or we pity the lot of mankind while they lived under uncertain establishments and were obliged to sustain in the same person the character of the senator the statesman and the soldier Polished nations discover that any one of these characters is sufficient in one person and that the ends of each when disjoined are more easily accomplished The first however were circumstances under which nations advanced and prospered the second were  those in which the spirit relaxed and the nation went to decay  WE may with good reason congratulate our species on their having escaped from a state of barbarous disorder and violence into a state of domestic peace and regular policy when they have sheathed the dagger and disarmed the animosities of civil contention when the weapons with which they contend are the reasonings of the wise and the tongue of the eloquent But we cannot meantime help to regret that they should ever proceed in search of perfection to place every branch of administration behind the counter and come to employ instead of the statesman and warrior the mere clerk and accountant  BY carrying this system to its height men are educated who could copy for Caesar his military instructions or even execute a part of his plans but none who could act in all the different scenes for which the leader himself must be qualified in the state and in the field in times of order or of tumult in times of division or of unanimity none who could animate the council when deliberating on ordinary occasions or when alarmed by attacks from abroad  THE policy of China is the most perfect model of an arrangement at which the ordinary refinements of government are aimed and the inhabitants of this empire possess in the highest degree those arts on which vulgar minds make the felicity and greatness of nations to depend The state has acquired in a measure unequalled in the history of mankind numbers of men and the  other resources of war They have done what we are very apt to admire they have brought national affairs to the level of the meanest  pacity they have broke them into parts and thrown them into separate departments they have clothed every proceeding with splendid ceremonies and majestical forms and where the reverence of forms cannot repress disorder a rigorous and severe police armed with every species of corporal punishment is applied to the purpose The whip and the cudgel are held up to all orders of men they are at once employed and they are dreaded by every magistrate A mandarine is whipped for having ordered a pickpocket to receive too few or too many blows  EVERY department of state is made the object of a separate profession and every candidate for office must have passed through a regular education and as in the graduations of the university must have obtained by his proficiency or his standing the degree to which he aspires The tribunals of state of war and of the revenue as well as of literature are conducted by graduates in their different studies but while learning is the great road to preferment it terminates in being able to read and to write and the great object of government consists in raising and in consuming the fruits of the earth With all these resources and this learned preparation which is made to turn these resources to use the state is in reality weak has repeatedly given the example which we seek to explain and among the doctors of war or of policy among the millions who are set apart for the military profession can find none of its members who are fit to stand forth in the  dangers of their country or to form a defence against the repeated inroads of an enemy reputed to be artless and mean  IT is difficult to tell how long the decay of states might be suspended by the cultivation of arts on which their real felicity and strength depend by cultivating in the higher ranks those talents for the council and the field which cannot without great disadvantage be separated and in the body of a people that zeal for their country and that military character which enable them to take a share in defending its rights  TIMES may come when every proprietor must defend his own possessions and every free people maintain their own independence We may imagine that against such an extremity an army of hired troops is a sufficient precaution but their own troops are the very enemy against which a people is sometimes obliged to fight We may flatter ourselves that extremities of this sort in any particular case are remote but we cannot in reasoning on the general fortunes of mankind avoid putting the case and referring to the examples in which it has happened It has happened in every instance where the polished have fallen a prey to the rude and where the pacific inhabitant has been reduced to subjection by military force  IF the desence and government of a people be made to depend on a few who make the conduct of state or of war their profession whether these be foreigners or natives whether they be called away of a sudden like the Roman legion from  Britain whether they turn against their employers like the army of Carthage or be overpowered and dispersed by a stroke of fortune the multitude of a cowardly and undisciplined people must on such an emergence receive a foreign or a domestic enemy as they would a plague or an earthquake with hopeless amazement and terror and by their numbers only swell the triumphs and enrich the spoil of a conqueror  STATESMEN and leaders of armies accustomed to the mere observance of forms are disconcerted by a suspension of customary rules and on slight grounds despair of their country They were qualified only to go the rounds of a particular track and when forced from their stations are in reality unable to act with men They only took part in formalities of which they understood not the tendency and together with the modes of procedure even the very state itself in their apprehension has ceased to exist The numbers possessions and resources of a great people only serve in their view to constitute a scene of hopeless confusion and terror  IN rude ages under the appellations of  a community    a people  or  a nation  was understood a number of men and the state while its members remained was accounted entire The Scythians while they fled before Darius mocked at his childish attempt Athens survived the devastations of Xerxes and Rome in its rude state those of the Gauls With polished and mercantile states the case is sometimes reversed The nation is a territory cultivated and improved by  its owners destroy the possession even while the master remains the state is undone  THAT weakness and effeminacy of which polished nations are sometimes accused has it place probably in the mind alone The strength of animals and that of man in particular depends on his feeding and the kind of labour to which he is used Wholesome food and hard labour the portion of many in every polished and commercial nation secure to the public a number of men endued with bodily strength and inured to hardship and toil  EVEN delicate living and good accommodation are not found to enervate the body The armies of Europe have been obliged to make the experiment and the children of opulent families bred in effeminacy or nursed with tender care have been made to contend with the savage By imitating his arts they have learned like him to traverse the forest and in every season to subsist in the desert They have perhaps recovered a lesson which it has cost civilized nations many ages to unlearn That the fortune of a man is entire while he remains possessed of himself  IT may be thought however that few of the celebrated nations of antiquity whose fate has given rise to so much reflection on the vicissitudes of human affairs had made any great progress in those enervating arts we have mentioned or made those arrangements from which the danger in question could be supposed to arise The Greeks in particular at the time of their fall under the Macedonian yoke had certainly not carried the  commercial arts to so great a height as is common with the most flourishing and prosperous nations of Europe They had still retained the form of independent republics the people were generally admitted to a share in the government and not being able to hire armies they were obliged by necessity to bear a part in the defence of their country By their frequent wars and domestic commotions they were accustomed to danger and were familiar with alarming situations they were accordingly still accounted the best soldiers and the best statesmen of the known world The younger Cyrus promised himself the empire of Asia by means of their aid and after his fall a body of ten thousand although bereft of their leaders baffled in their retreat all the military force of the Persian empire The victor of Asia did not think himself prepared for that conquest till he had formed an army from the subdued republics of Greece  IT is however true that in the age of Philip the military and political spirit of those nations appears to have been considerably impaired and to have suffered perhaps from the variety of interests and pursuits as well as of pleasures with which their members came to be occupied they even made a kind of separation between the civil and military character Phocion we are told by Plutarch having observed that the leading men of his time followed different courses that some applied themselves to civil others to military affairs determined rather to follow the examples of Themistocles Aristides and Pericles the leaders of a former age who were equally prepared for either  WE find in the orations of Demosthenes a perpetual reference to this state of manners We find him exhorting the Athenians not only to declare war but to arm themselves for the execution of their own military plans We find that there was an order of military men who easily passed from the service of one state to that of another and who when they were neglected at home turned away to enterprises on their own account There were not perhaps better warriors in any former age but those warriors were not attached to any state and the settled inhabitants of every city thought themselves disqualified for military service The discipline of armies was perhaps improved but the vigour of nations was gone to decay When Philip or Alexander defeated the Grecian armies which were chiefly composed of soldiers of fortune they found an easy conquest with the other inhabitants and when the latter afterwards supported by those soldiers invaded the Persian empire he seems to have left little martial spirit behind him and by removing the military men to have taken precaution enough in his absence to secure his dominion over this mutinous and refractory people  THE subdivision of arts and professions in certain examples tends to improve the practice of them and to promote their ends By having separated the arts of the clothier and the tanner we are the better supplied with shoes and with cloth But to separate the arts which form the citizen and the statesman the arts of policy and war is an attempt to dismember the human character and to destroy those very arts we mean to  improve By this separation we in effect deprive a free people of what is necessary to their safety or we prepare a defence against invasions from abroad which gives a prospect of usurpation and threatens the establishment of military government at home  WE may be surprised to find the beginning of certain military instructions at Rome referred to a time no earlier than that of the Cimbric war It was then we are told by Valerius Maximus that Roman soldiers were made to learn from gladiators the use of a sword and the antagonists of Phyrrhus and of Hannibal were by the account of this writer still in need of instruction in the first rudiments of their trade They had already by the order and choice of their incampments impressed the Grecian invader with awe and respect they had already not by their victories but by their national vigour and firmness under repeated defeats induced him to sue for peace But the haughty Roman perhaps knew the advantage of order and of union without having been broke to the inferior arts of the mercenary soldier and had the courage to face the enemies of his country without having practised the use of his weapon under the fear of being whipped He could ill be persuaded that a time might come when refined and intelligent nations would make the art of war to consist in a few technical forms that citizens and soldiers might come to be distinguished as much as women and men that the citizen would become possessed of a property which he would not be able or required to defend that the soldier would be appointed to keep for another what he would be taught to desire and what he  would be enabled to seize for himself that in short one set of men were to have an interest in the preservation of civil establishments without the power to defend them that the other were to have this power without either the inclination or the interest  THIS people however by degrees came to put their military force on the very footing to which this description alludes Marius made a capital change in the manner of levying soldiers at Rome He filled his legions with the mean and the indigent who depended on military pay for subsistence he created a force which rested on mere discipline alone and the skill of the gladiator he taught his troops to employ their swords against the constitution of their country and set the example of a practice which was soon adopted and improved by his successors  THE Romans only meant by their armies to incroach on the freedom of other nations while they preserved their own They forgot that in assembling soldiers of fortune and in suffering any leader to be master of a disciplined army they actually resigned their political rights and suffered a master to arise for the state This people in short whose ruling passion was depredation and conquest perished by the recoil of an engine which they themselves had erected against mankind  THE boasted refinements then of the polished age are not divested of danger They open a door perhaps to disaster as wide and accessible as any of those they have shut If they build walls  and ramparts they enervate the minds of those who are placed to defend them if they form disciplined armies they reduce the military spirit of entire nations and by placing the sword where they have given a distaste to civil establishments they prepare for mankind the government of force  IT is happy for the nations of Europe that the disparity between the soldier and the pacific citizen can never be so great as it became among the Greeks and the Romans In the use of modern arms the novice is made to learn and to practise with ease all that the veteran knows and if to teach him were a matter of real difficulty happy are they who are not deterred by such difficulties and who can discover the arts which tend to fortify and preserve not to enervate and ruin their country  SECT V  Of National Waste  THE strength of nations consists in the wealth the numbers and the character of their people The history of their progress from a state of rudeness is for the most part a detail of the struggles they have maintained and of the arts they have practised to strengthen or to secure themselves Their conquests their population and their commerce their civil and military arrangements their skill in the construction of weapons and in the methods of attack and defence the very distribution of tasks whether in private business or in public affairs either tend to bestow or promise to employ with advantage the constituents of a national force and the resources of war  IF we suppose that together with these advantages the military character of a people remains or is improved it must follow that what is gained in civilization is a real increase of strength and that the ruin of nations could never take its rise from themselves Where states have stopped short in their progress or have actually gone to decay we may suspect that however disposed to advance they have found a limit beyond which they could not proceed or from a remission of the national spirit and a weakness of  character were unable to make the most of their resources and natural advantages On this supposition from being stationary they may begin to relapse and by a retrograde motion in a succession of ages arrive at a state of greater weakness than that which they quitted in the beginning of their progress and with the appearance of better arts and superior conduct expose themselves to become a prey to barbarians whom in the attainment or the height of their glory they had easily baffled or despised  WHATEVER may be the natural wealth of a people or whatever may be the limits beyond which they cannot improve on their stock it is probable that no nation has ever reached those limits or has been able to postpone its misfortunes and effects of misconduct until its fund of materials and the fertility of its soil were exhausted or the numbers of its people were greatly reduced The same errors in policy and weakness of manners which prevent the proper use of resources likewise check their increase or improvement  THE wealth of the state consists in the sortune of its members The actual revenue of the state is that share of every private fortune which the public has been accustomed to demand for national purposes This revenue cannot be always proportioned to what may be supposed redundant in the private estate but to what is in some measure thought so by the owner and to what he may be made to spare without intrenching on his manner of living and without suspending his projects of expence or of commerce It should appear  therefore that any immoderate increase of private expence is a prelude to national weakness government even while each of its subjects consumes a princely estate may be straitened in point of revenue and the paradox be explained by example That the public is poor while its members are rich  WE are frequently led into error by mistaking money for riches we think that a people cannot be impoverished by a waste of Money which is spent among themselves The fact is that men are impoverished only in two ways either by having their gains suspended or by having their substance consumed and money expended at home being circulated and not consumed cannot any more than the exchange of a tally or a counter among a certain number of hands tend to diminish the wealth of the company among whom it is handed about But while money circulates at home the necessaries of life which are the real constituents of wealth may be idly consumed the industry which might be employed to increase the stock of a people may be suspended or turned to abuse  GREAT armies maintained either at home or abroad without any national object are so many mouths unnecessarily opened to waste the stores of the public and so many hands withheld from the arts by which its profits are made Unsuccessful enterprises are so many ventures thrown away and losses sustained proportioned to the capital employed in the service The Helvetii in order to invade the Roman province of Gaul burnt their habitations dropt their instruments of  husbandry and consumed in one year the savings of many The enterprise failed of success and the nation was undone  STATES have endeavoured in some instances by pawning their credit instead of employing their capital to disguise the hazards they ran They have found in the loans they raised a casual resource which encouraged their enterprises They have seemed by their manner of erecting transferrable funds to leave the capital for purposes of trade in the hands of the subject while it is actually expended by the government They have by these means proceeded to the execution of great national projects without suspending private industry and have left future ages to answer in part for debts contracted with a view to future emolument So far the expedient is plausible and appears to be just The growing burden too is thus gradually laid and if a nation be to sink in some future age every minister hopes it may still keep afloat in his own But the measure for this very reason is with all its advantages extremely dangerous in the hands of a precipitant and ambitious administration regarding only the present occasion and imagining a state to be inexhaustible while a capital can be borrowed and the interest be paid  WE are told of a nation who during a certain period rivalled the glories of the ancient world threw off the dominion of a master armed against them with the powers of a great kingdom broke the yoke with which they had been oppressed and almost within the course of a century raised by their industry and national vigour a  new and formidable power which struck the former potentates of Europe with awe and suspense and turned the badges of poverty with which they set out into the ensigns of war and dominion This end was attained by the great efforts of a spirit awaked by oppression by a successful pursuit of national wealth and by a rapid anticipation of future revenue But this illustrious state is supposed not only in the language of a former section to have preoccupied the business they have sequestered the inheritance of many ages to come  GREAT national expence however does not imply the necessity of any national suffering While revenue is applied with success to obtain some valuable end the profits of every adventure being more than sufficient to repay its costs the public should gain and its resources should continue to multiply But an expence whether sustained at home or abroad whether a waste of the present or an anticipation of future revenue if it bring no proper return is to be reckoned among the causes of national ruin  PART SIXTH  Of Corruption and Political Slavery  SECT I  Of Corruption in general  IF the fortune of nations and their tendency to aggrandisement or to ruin were to be estimated by merely balancing on the principles of last section articles of profit and loss every argument in politics would rest on a comparison of national expence with national gain on a comparison of the numbers who consume with those who produce or amass the necessaries of life The columns of the industrious and the idle would include all order of men and the state itself being allowed as many magistrates politicians and warriors as were barely sufficient for its defence and its government should place  on the side of its loss every name that is supernumerary on the civil or the military list all those orders of men who by the possession of fortune subsist on the gains of others and by the nicety of their choice require a great expence of time and of labour to supply their consumption all those who are idly employed in the train of persons of rank all those who are engaged in the professions of law physic or divinity together with all the learned who do not by their studies promote or improve the practice of some lucrative trade The value of every person in short should be computed from his labour and that of labour itself from its tendency to procure and amass the means of subsistence The arts employed on mere superfluities should be prohibited except when their produce could be exchanged with foreign nations for commodities that might be employed to maintain useful men for the public  THESE appear to be the rules by which a miser would examine the state of his own affairs or those of his country but schemes of perfect corruption are at least as impracticable as schemes of perfect virtue Men are not universally misers they will not be satisfied with the pleasure of hoarding they must be suffered to enjoy their wealth in order that they may take the trouble of becoming rich Property in the common course of human affairs is unequally divided we are therefore obliged to suffer the wealthy to squander that the poor may subsist we are obliged to tolerate certain orders of men who are above the necessity of labour in order that in their condition there may be an object of ambition and a rank to which the busy aspire We are not only obliged to admit numbers  who in strict oeconomy may be reckoned superfluous on the civil the military and the political list but because we are men and prefer the occupation improvement and felicity of our nature to its mere existence we must even wish that as many members as possible of every community may be admitted to a share of its defence and its government  MEN in fact while they pursue in society different objects or separate views procure a wide distribution of power and by a species of chance arrive at a posture for civil engagements more favourable to human nature than what human wisdom could ever calmly devise  IF the strength of a nation in the mean time consists in the men on whom it may rely and who are fortunately or wisely combined for its preservation it follows that manners are as important as either numbers or wealth and that corruption is to be accounted a principal cause of national declension and ruin  WHOEVER perceives what are the qualities of man in his excellence may easily by that standard distinguish his defects or corruptions If an intelligent a courageous and an affectionate mind constitutes the perfection of his nature remarkable failings in any of those particulars must proportionally sink or debase his character  WE have observed that it is the happiness of the individual to make a right choice of his conduct that this choice will lead him to lose in  society the sense of a personal interest and in the consideration of what is due to the whole to stifie those anxieties which relate to himself as a part  THE natural disposition of man to humanity and the warmth of his temper may raise his character to this fortunate pitch His elevation in a great measure depends on the form of his society but he can without incurring the charge of corruption accommodate himself to great variations in the constitutions of government The same integrity and vigorous spirit which in democratical states renders him tenacious of his equality may under aristocracy or monarchy lead him to maintain the subordinations established He may entertain towards the different ranks of men with whom he is yoked in the state maxims of respect and of candour he may in the choice of his actions follow a principle of justice and of honour which the considerations of safety preferment or profit cannot efface  FROM our complaints of national depravity it should notwithstanding appear that whole bodies of men are sometimes infected with an epidemical weakness of the head or corruption of heart by which they become unfit for the stations they occupy and threaten the states they compose however flourishing with a prospect of decay and of ruin  A CHANGE of national manners for the worse may arise from a discontinuance of the scenes in which the talents of men were happily cultivated and brought into exercise or from a change in  the prevailing opinions relating to the constituents of honour or of happiness When mere riches or courtfavour are supposed to constitute rank the mind is misled from the consideration of qualities on which it ought to rely Magnanimity courage and the love of mankind are sacrificed to avarice and vanity or suppressed under a sense of dependence The individual considers his community so far only as it can be rendered subservient to his personal advancement or profit he states himself in competition with his fellowcreatures and urged by the passions of emulation of fear and jealousy of envy and malice he follows the maxims of an animal destined to preserve his separate existence and to indulge his caprice or his appetite at the expence of his species  ON this corrupt foundation men become either rapacious deceitful and violent ready to trespass on the rights of others or servile mercenary and base prepared to relinquish their own Talents capacity and force of mind possessed by a person of the first description serve to plunge him the deeper in misery and to sharpen the agony of cruel passions which lead him to wreak on his fellowcreatures the torments that prey on himself To a person of the second imagination and reason itself only serve to point out false objects of fear or desire and to multiply the subjects of disappointment and of momentary joy In either case and whether we suppose that corrupt men are urged by covetousness or betrayed by fear and without specifying the crimes which from either disposition they are prepared to commit we may safely affirm with Socrates  That  every master should pray he may not meet with such a slave and every such person being unfit for liberty should implore that he may meet with a merciful master  MAN under this measure of corruption although he may be bought for a slave by those who know how to turn his faculties and his labour to profit and although when kept under proper restraints his neighbourhood may be convenient or useful yet is certainly unfit to act on the footing of a liberal combination or concert with his fellowcreatures his mind is not addicted to friendship or confidence he is not willing to act for the preservation of others nor deserves that any other should hazard his own safety for his  THE actual character of mankind meantime in the worst as well as the best condition is undoubtedly mixed and nations of the best description are greatly obliged for their preservation not only to the good disposition of their members but likewise to those political institutions by which the violent are restrained from the commission of crimes and the cowardly or the selfish are made to contribute their part to the public defence or prosperity By means of such institutions and the wise precautions of government nations are enabled to subsist and even to prosper under very different degrees of corruption or of public integrity  SO long as the majority of a people is supposed to act on maxims of probity the example of the good and even the caution of the bad give a general appearance of integrity and of innocence  Where men are to one another objects of affection and of confidence where they are generally disposed not to offend government may be remiss and every person may be treated as innocent till he is found to be guilty As the subject in this case does not hear of the crimes so he need not be told of the punishments inflicted on persons of a different character But where the manners of a people are considerably changed for the worse every subject must stand on his guard and government itself must act on suitable maxims of fear and distrust The individual no longer fit to be indulged in his pretensions to personal consideration independence or freedom each of which he would turn to abuse must be taught by external force and from motives of fear to counterfeit those effects of innocence and of duty to which he is not disposed he must be reserred to the whip or the gibbet for arguments in support of a caution which the state now requires him to assume on a supposition that he is insensible to the motives which recommend the practice of virtue  THE rules of despotism are made for the government of corrupted men They were indeed followed on some remarkable occasions even under the Roman commonwealth and the bloody axe to terrify the citizen from his crimes and to repel the casual and temporary irruptions of vice was repeatedly committed to the arbitrary will of the dictator They were finally established on the ruins of the republic itself when either the people became too corrupted for freedom or when the magistrate became too corrupted to resign his dictatorial power This species of government comes naturally in the termination of a continued  and growing corruption but has no doubt in some instances come too soon and has sacrificed remains of virtue that deserved a better fate to the jealousy of tyrants who were in haste to augment their power This method of government cannot in such cases fail to introduce that measure of corruption against whose external effects it is desired as a remedy When fear is suggested as the only motive to duty every heart becomes rapacious or base And this medicine if applied to a healthy body is sure to create the distemper it is destined to cure  THIS is the manner of government into which the covetous and the arrogant to satiate their unhappy desires would hurry their fellowcreatures it is a manner of government to which the timorous and the servile submit at discretion and when these characters of the rapacious and the timid divide mankind even the virtues of Antoninus or Trajan can do no more than apply with candour and with vigour the whip and the sword and endeavour by the hopes of reward or the fear of punishment to find a speedy and a temporary cure for the crimes or the imbecilities of men  OTHER states may be more or less corrupted this has corruption for its basis Here justice may sometimes direct the arm of the despotical sovereign but the name of justice is most commonly employed to signify the interest or the caprice of a reigning power Human society susceptible of such a variety of forms here finds the simplest of all The toils and possessions of many are destined to asswage the passions of one  or a few and the only parties that remain among mankind are the oppressor who demands and the oppressed who dare not refuse  NATIONS while they were intitled to a milder fate as in the case of the Greeks repeatedly conquered have been reduced to this condition by military force They have reached it too in the maturity of their own depravations when like the Romans returned from the conquest and loaded with the spoils of the world they gave loose to saction and to crimes too bold and too frequent for the correction of ordinary government and when the sword of justice dropping with blood and perpetually required to suppress accumulating disorders on every side could no longer await the delays and precautions of an administration fettered by laws  IT is however well known from the history of mankind that corruption of this or of any other degree is not peculiar to nations in their decline or in the result of signal prosperity and great advances in the arts of commerce The bands of society indeed in small and infant establishments are generally strong and their subjects either by an ardent devotion to their own tribe or a vehement animosity against enemies and by a vigorous courage founded on both are well qualified to urge or to sustain the fortune of a growing community But the savage and the barbarian have given notwithstanding in the case of entire nations some examples of a weak and timorous character  The barbarous nations of Siberia in general are servile and timid  They have in more instances fallen  into that species of corruption which we have already described in treating of barbarous nations they have made rapine their trade not merely as a species of warfare or with a view to enrich their community but to possess in property what they learned to prefer even to the ties of affection or of blood  IN the lowest state of commercial arts the passions for wealth and for dominion have exhibited scenes of oppression or servility which the most finished corruption of the arrogant the cowardly and the mercenary founded on the desire of procuring or the fear of losing a fortune could not exceed In such cases the vices of men unrestrained by forms and unawed by police are suffered to riot at large and to produce their entire effects Parties accordingly unite or separate on the maxims of a gang of robbers they sacrifice to interest the tenderest affections of human nature The parent supplies the market for slaves even by the sale of his own children the cottage ceases to be a sanctuary for the weak and the defenceless stranger and rites of hospitality often so sacred among nations in their primitive state come to be violated like every other tie of humanity without fear or remorse  Chardin's travel's through Mingrelia into Persia    NATIONS which in later periods of their history became eminent for civil wisdom and justice had perhaps in a former age paroxysms of lawless disorder to which this description might in part be applied The very policy by which they arrived at their degree of national felicity was devised as a remedy for outrageous abuse The  establishment of order was dated from the commission of rapes and murders indignation and private revenge were the principles on which nations proceeded to the expulsion of tyrants to the emancipation of mankind and the full explanation of their political rights  DEFECTS of government and of law may be in some cases considered as a symptom of innocence and of virtue But where power is already established where the strong are unwilling to suffer restraint or the weak unable to find a protection the defects of law are marks of the most perfect corruption  AMONG rude nations government is often defective both because men are not yet acquainted with all the evils for which polished nations have endeavoured to find a redress and because even where evils of the most flagrant nature have long afflicted the peace of society they have not yet been able to apply the cure In the progress of civilization new distempers break forth and new remedies are applied but the remedy is not always applied the moment the distemper appears and laws though suggested by the commission of crimes are not the symptom of a recent corruption but of a desire to find a remedy that may cure perhaps some inveterate evil which has long afflicted the state  THERE are corruptions however under which men still possess the vigour and the resolution to correct themselves Such are the violence and the outrage which accompany the collision of fierce and daring spirits occupied in the struggles which  sometimes precede the dawn of civil and commercial improvements In such cases men have frequently discovered a remedy for evils of which their own misguided impetuosity and superior force of mind were the principal causes But if to a depraved disposition we suppose to be joined a weakness of spirit if to an admiration and desire of riches be joined an aversion to danger or business if those orders of men whose valour is required by the public cease to be brave if the members of society in general have not those personal qualities which are required to fill the stations of equality or of honour to which they are invited by the forms of the state they must sink to a depth from which their imbecility even more than their depraved inclinations may prevent their rise  SECT II  Of Luxury  WE are far from being agreed on the application of the term  luxury  or on that degree of its meaning which is consistent with national prosperity or with the moral rectitude of our nature It is sometimes employed to signify a manner of life which we think necessary to civilization and even to happiness It is in our panegyric of polished ages the parent of arts the support of commerce and the minister of national greatness and of opulence It is in our censure of degenerate manners the source of corruption and the presage of national declension and ruin It is admired and it is blamed it is treated as ornamental and useful and it is proscribed as a vice  WITH all this diversity in our judgements we are generally uniform in employing the term to signify that complicated apparatus which mankind devise for the ease and convenience of life Their buildings furniture equipage cloathing train of domestics refinement of the table and in general all that assemblage which is rather intended to please the fancy than to obviate real wants and which is rather ornamental than useful  WHEN we are disposed therefore under the appellation of  luxury  to rank the enjoyment of of these things among the vices we either tacitly refer to the habits of sensuality debauchery prodigality vanity and arrogance with which the possession of high fortune is sometimes attended or we apprehend a certain measure of what is necessary to human life beyond which all enjoyments are supposed to be excessive and vicious When on the contrary luxury is made an article of national lustre and felicity we only think of it as an innocent consequence of the unequal distribution of wealth and as a method by which different ranks are rendered mutually dependent and mutually useful The poor are made to practise arts and the rich to reward them The public itself is made a gainer by what seems to waste its stock and it receives a perpetual increase of wealth from the influence of those growing appetites and delicate tastes which seem to menace consumption and ruin  IT is certain that we must either together with the commercial arts suffer their fruits to be enjoyed and even in some measure admired or like the Spartans prohibit the art itself while we are afraid of its consequences or while we think that the conveniencies it brings exceed what nature requires  WE may propose to stop the advancement of arts at any stage of their progress and still incur the censure of luxury from those who have not advanced so far The housebuilder and the carpenter at Sparta were limited to the use of the  axe and the saw but a Spartan cottage might have passed for a palace in Thrace and if the dispute were to turn on the knowledge of what is physically necessary to the preservation of human life as the standard of what is morally lawful the faculties of physic as well as of morality would probably divide on the subject and leave every individual as at present to find some rule for himself The casuist for the most part considers the practice of his own age and condition as a standard for mankind If in one age or condition he condemn the use of a coach in another he would have no less censured the wearing of shoes and the very person who exclaims against the first would probably not have spared the second if it had not been already familiar in ages before his own A censor born in a cottage and accustomed to sleep upon straw does not propose that men should return to the woods and the caves for shelter he admits the reasonableness and the utility of what is already famil  r and apprehends an excess and corruption only in the newest refinement of the rising generation  THE clergy of Europe have preached successively against every new fashion and every innovation in dress The modes of youth are the subject of censure to the old and modes of the last age in their turn are matter of ridicule to the flippant and the young Of this there is not always a better account to be given than that the old are disposed to be severe and the young to be merry  THE argument against many of the conveniencies of life drawn from the mere consideration of their not being necessary was equally proper in the mouth of the savage who dissuaded from the first applications of industry as it is in that of the moralist who insists on the vanity of the last  Our ancestors  he might say  found their dwelling under this rock they gathered their food in the forest they allayed their thirst from the fountain and they were clothed in the spoils of the beast they had slain Why should we indulge a false delicacy or require from the earth fruits which she is not accustomed to yield The bow of our fathers is already too strong for our arms and the wild beast begins to lord it in the woods  THUS the moralist may have found in the proceedings of every age those topics of blame from which he is so much disposed to arraign the manners of his own and our embarrassment on the subject is perhaps but a part of that general perplexity which we undergo in trying to define moral characters by external circumstances which may or may not be attended with faults in the mind and the heart One man finds a vice in the wearing of linen another does not unless the fabric be fine and if meantime it be true that a person may be dressed in manufacture either course or fine that he may sleep in the fields or lodge in a palace tread upon carpet or plant his foot on the ground while the mind either retains or has lost its penetration and its vigour and the heart its affection to mankind it is vain under any such circumstance to seek for the distinctions  of virtue and vice or to tax the polished citizen with weakness for any part of his equipage or for his wearing a sur perhaps in which some savage was dressed before him Vanity is not distinguished by any peculiar species of dress It is betrayed by the Indian in the phantastic assortments of his plumes his shells his partycoloured furs and in the time he bestows at the glass and the toilet Its projects in the woods and in the town are the same in the one it seeks with the visage bedaubed and with teeth artificially stained for that admiration which it courts in the other with a gilded equipage and liveries of state  POLISHED nations in their progress often come to surpass the rude in moderation and severity of manners  The Greek  says Thucydides  not long ago like barbarians wore golden spangles in the hair and went armed in times of peace  Simplicity of dress in this people became a mark of politeness and the mere materials with which the body is nourished or clothed are probably of little consequence to any people We must look for the characters of men in the qualities of the mind not in the species of their food or in the mode of their apparel What are now the ornaments of the grave and severe what is owned to be a real conveniency were once the sopperies of youth or were devised to please the effeminate The new fashion indeed is often the mark of the coxcomb but we frequently change our fashions without increasing the measures of our vanity or folly  ARE the apprehensions of the severe therefore in every age equally groundless and unreasonable  Are we never to dread any error in the article of a refinement bestowed on the means of subsistence or the conveniencies of life The fact is that men are perpetually exposed to the commission of error in this article not merely where they are accustomed to high measures of accommodation or to any particular species of food but whereever these objects in general may come to be preferred to friends to a country or to mankind they actually commit such error whereever they admire paultry distinctions or frivolous advantages whereever they shrink from small inconveniencies and are incapable of discharging their duty with vigour The use of morality on this subject is not to limit men to any particular species of lodging diet or cloaths but to prevent their considering these conveniencies as the principal objects of human life And if we are asked Where the pursuit of trifling accommodations should stop in order that a man may devote himself entirely to the higher engagements of life we may answer That it should stop where it is This was the rule followed at Sparta The object of the rule was to preserve the heart entire for the public and to occupy men in cultivating their own nature not in accumulating wealth and external conveniencies It was not expected otherwise that the axe or the saw should be attended with greater political advantage than the plane and the chisel When Cato walked the streets of Rome without his robe and without shoes he did so most probably in contempt of what his countrymen were so prone to admire not in hopes of finding a virtue in one species of dress or a vice in another  LUXURY therefore considered as a predilection in favour of the objects of vanity and the costly materials of pleasure is ruinous to the human character considered as the mere use of accommodations and conveniencies which the age has procured rather depends on the progress which the mechanical arts have made and on the degree in which the fortunes of men are unequally parcelled than on the dispositions of particular men either to vice or to virtue  DIFFERENT measures of luxury are however variously suited to different constitutions of government The advancement of arts supposes an unequal distribution of fortune and the means of distinction they bring serve to render the separation of ranks more sensible Luxury is upon this account apart from all its moral effects adverse to the form of democratical government and in any state of society can be safely admitted in that degree only in which the members of the community are supposed of unequal rank and constitute public order by means of a regular subordination High degrees of it appear salutary and even necessary in monarchical and mixed governments where besides the encouragement to arts and commerce it serves to give lustre to those hereditary or constitutional dignities which have a place of importance in the political system Whether even here luxury leads to abuse peculiar to ages of high refinement and opulence we shall proceed to consider in the following sections  SECT III  Of the Corruption incident to Polished Nations  LUXURY and corruption are frequently coupled together and even pass for synonymous terms But in order to avoid any dispute about words by the first we may understand that accumulation of wealth and that refinement on the ways of enjoying it which are the objects of industry or the fruits of mechanic and commercial arts And by the second a real weakness or depravity of the human character which may accompany any state of those arts and be found under any external circumstances or condition whatsoever It remains to inquire What are the corruptions incident to polished nations arrived at certain measures of luxury and possessed of certain advantages in which they are generally supposed to excel  WE need not have recourse to a parallel between the manners of entire nations in the extremes of civilization and rudeness in order to be satisfied that the vices of men are not proportioned to their fortunes or that the habits of avarice or of sensuality are not founded on any certain measures of wealth or determinate kind of enjoyment Where the situations of particular men are varied as much by their personal stations as they can be by the state of national refinements the same passions for interest or pleasure prevail in every condition They arise from temperament  or an acquired admiration of property not from any particular manner of life in which the parties are engaged nor from any particular species of property which may have occupied their cares and their wishes  TEMPERANCE and moderation are at least as frequent among those whom we call the superior as they are among the lower classes of men and however we may affix the character of sobriety to mere cheapness of diet and other accommodations with which any particular age or rank of men appear to be contented it is well known that costly materials are not necessary to constitute a debauch nor profligacy less frequent under the thatched roof than under the lofty ceiling Men grow equally familiar with different conditions receive equal pleasure and are equally allured to sensuality in the palace and in the cave Their acquiring in either habits of intemperance or sloth depends on the remission of other pursuits and on the distaste of the mind to other engagements If the affections of the heart be awake and the passions of love admiration or anger be kindled the costly furniture of the palace as well as the homely accommodations of the cottage are neglected and men when roused reject their repose or when wearied embrace it alike on the silken bed or on the couch of straw  WE are not however from hence to conclude that luxury with all its concomitant circumstances which either serve to favour its increase or which in the arrangements of civil society follow it as consequences can have no effect to the disadvantage of national manners If that respite from  public dangers and troubles which gives a leisure for the practice of commercial arts be continued or increased into a disuse of national efforts if the individual not called to unite with his country be left to pursue his private advantage we may find him become effeminate mercenary and sensual not because pleasures and profits are become more alluring but because he has fewer calls to attend to other objects and because he has more encouragement to study his personal advantages and pursue his separate interests  IF the disparities of rank and fortune which are necessary to the pursuit or enjoyment of luxury introduce false grounds of precedency and estimation if on the mere considerations of being rich or poor one order of men are in their own apprehension elevated another debased if one be criminally proud another meanly dejected and every rank in its place like the tyrant who thinks that nations are made for himself be disposed to assume on the rights of mankind although upon the comparison the higher order may be least corrupted or from education and a sense of personal dignity have most good qualitles remaining yet the one becoming mercenary and servile the other imperious and arrogant both regardless of justice and of merit the whole mass is corrupted and the manners of a society changed for the worse in proportion as its members cease to act on principles of equality independence or freedom  UPON this view and considering the merits of men in the abstract a mere change from the habits of a republic to those of a monarchy  from the love of equality to the sense of a subordination founded on birth titles and fortune is a species of corruption to mankind But this degree of corruption is still consistent with the safety and prosperity of some nations it admits of a vigorous courage by which the rights of individuals and of kingdoms may be long preserved  UNDER the form of monarchy while yet in its vigour superior fortune is indeed one mark by which the different orders of men are distinguished but there are some other ingredients without which wealth is not admitted as a foundation of precedency and in favour of which it is often despised and lavished away Such are birth and titles the reputation of courage courtly manners and a certain elevation of mind If we suppose that these distinctions are forgotten and nobility itself only to be known by the sumptuous retinue which money alone may procure and by a lavish expence which the more recent fortunes can generally best sustain luxury must then be allowed to corrupt the monarchical as much as the republican state and to introduce a fatal dissolution of manners under which men of every condition although they are eager to acquire or to display their wealth have no remains of real ambition They have neither the elevation of nobles nor the fidelity of subjects they have changed into effeminate vanity that sense of honour which gave rules to the personal courage and into a servile baseness that loyalty which bound each in his place to his immediate superior and the whole to the throne  NATIONS are most exposed to corruption from this quarter when the mechanical arts being greatly advanced furnish numberless articles to be applied in ornament to the person in furniture entertainment or equipage when such articles as the rich alone can procure are admired and when consideration precedence and rank are accordingly made to depend on fortune  IN a more rude state of the arts although wealth be unequally divided the opulent can amass only the simple means of subsistence They can only fill the granary and furnish the stall reap from more extended fields and drive their herds over a larger pasture To enjoy their magnificence they must live in a croud and to secure their possessions they must be surrounded with friends that espouse their quarrels Their honours as well as their safety consist in the numbers who attend them and their personal distinctions are taken from their liberality and supposed elevation of mind In this manner the possession of riches serves only to make the owner assume a character of magnanimity to become the guardian of numbers rr the public object of respect and affection But when the bulky constituents of wealth and of rustic magnificence can be exchanged for refinements and when the produce of the soil may be turned into equipage and mere decoration when the combination of many is no longer required for personal safety the master may become the sole consumer of his own estate he may refer the use of every subject to himself he may employ the materials of generosity to feed a personal vanity or to indulge a sickly and effeminate fancy  which has learned to enumerate the trappings of weakness or folly among the necessaries of life  THE Persian satrape we are told when he saw the King of Sparta at the place of their conference stretched on the grass with his soldiers blushed at the provision he had made for the accommodation of his own person he ordered the furs and the carpets to be withdrawn he felt his own inferiority and recollected that he was to treat with a man not to vie with a pageant in costly attire and magnificence  WHEN amidst circumstances that make no trial of the virtues or talents of men we have been accustomed to the air of superiority which people of fortune derive from their retinue we are apt to lose every sense of distinction arising from merit or even from abilities We rate our fellowcitizens by the  figure  they are able to make by their buildings their dress their equipage and the train of their followers All these circumstances make a part in our estimate of what is excellent and if the master himself is known to be a pageant in the midst of his fortune we nevertheless pay our court to his station and look up with an envious servile or dejected mind to what is in itself scarcely fit to amuse children though when it is worn as a badge of distinction it inflames the ambition of those we call the great and strikes the multitude with awe and respect  WE judge of entire nations by the productions of a few mechanical arts and think we are talking of men while we are boasting of their estates their dress and their palaces The sense in which  we apply the terms  great  and  noble    high rank  and  high life  shew that we have on such occasions transferred the idea of perfection from the character to the equipage and that excellence itself is in our esteem a mere pageant adorned at a great expence by the labours of many workmen  TO those who overlook the subtile transitions of the imagination it might appear since wealth can do no more than furnish the means of subsistence and purchase animal pleasures that covetousness and venality itself should keep pace with our fears of want or with our appetite for sensual enjoyments and that where the appetite is satiated and the fear of want is removed the mind should be at ease on the subject of fortune But they are not the mere pleasures that riches procure nor the choice of viands which cover the board of the wealthy that inflame the passions of the covetous and the mercenary Nature is easily satisfied in all her enjoyments It is an opinion of eminence connected with fortune it is a sense of debasement attending on poverty which renders us blind to every advantage but that of the rich and insensible to every disgrace but that of the poor It is this unhappy apprehension that occasionally prepares us for the desertion of every duty for a submission to every indignity and for the commission of every crime that can be accomplished in safety  AURENGZEBE was not more renowned for sobriety in his private station and in the conduct of a supposed dissimulation by which he aspired to sovereign power than he continued to be even  on the throne of Indostan Simple abstinent and severe in his diet and other pleasures he still led the life of a hermit and occupied his time with a seemingly painful application to the affairs of a great empire  Gemelli Carceri  He quitted a station in which if pleasure had been his object he might have indulged his sensuality without reserve he made his way to a scene of disquietude and care he aimed at the summit of human greatness in the possession of imperial fortune not at the gratifications of animal appetite or the enjoyment of ease Superior to sensual pleasure as well as to the feelings of nature he dethroned his father and he murdered his brothers that he might roll on a carriage incrusted with diamond and pearl that his elephants his camels and his horses on the march might form a line extending many leagues might present a glittering harness to the sun and loaded with treasure usher to the view of an abject and admiring croud that awful majesty in whose presence they were to strike the forehead on the ground and be overwhelmed with the sense of his greatness and with that of their own debasement  AS these are the objects which prompt the desire of dominion and excite the ambitious to aim at the mastery of their fellowcreatures so they inspire the ordinary race of men with a sense of infirmity and meanness that prepares them to suffer indignities and to become the property of persons whom they consider as of a rank and a nature so much superior to their own  THE chains of perpetual slavery accordingly appear to be rivetted in the East no less by the pageantry which is made to accompany the possession of power than they are by the fears of the sword and the terrors of a military execution In the West as well as the East we are willing to bow to the splendid equipage and stand at an awful distance from the pomp of a princely estate We too may be terrified by the frowns or won by the smiles of those whose favour is riches and honour and whose displeasure is poverty and neglect We too may overlook the honours of the human soul from an admiration of the pageantries that accompany fortune The procession of elephants harnessed with gold might dazzle into slaves the people who derive corruption and weakness from the effect of their own arts and contrivances as well as those who inherit servility from their ancestors and are enfeebled by their natural temperament and the enervating charms of their soil and their climate  IT appears therefore that although the mere use of mateeials which constitute luxury may be distinguished from actual vice yet nations under a high state of the commercial arts are exposed to corruption by their admitting wealth unsupported by personal elevation and virtue as the great foundation of distinction and by having their attention turned on the side of interest as the road to consideration and honour  WITH this effect luxury may serve to corrupt democratical states by introducing a species  of monarchical subordination without that sense of high birth and hereditary honours which render the boundaries of rank fixed and determinate and which teach men to act in their stations with force and propriety It may prove the occasion of political corruption even in monarchical governments by drawing respect towards mere wealth by casting a shade on the lustre of personal qualities or familydistinctions and by infecting all orders of men with equal venality servility and cowardice  SECT IV  The same subject continued  THE increasing regard with which men appear in the progress of commercial arts to study their profit or the delicacy with which they refine on their pleasures even industry itself or the habit of application to a tedious employment in which no honours are won may perhaps be considered as indications of a growing attention to interest or of effeminacy contracted in the enjoyment of ease and conveniency Every successive art by which the individual is taught to improve on his fortune is in reality an addition to his private engagements and a new avocation of his mind from the public  CORRUPTION however does not arise from the abuse of commercial arts alone it requires the aid of political situation and is not produced by the objects that occupy a sordid and a mercenary spirit without the aid of circumstances that enable men to indulge in safety any mean disposition they have acquired  PROVIDENCE has fitted mankind for the higher engagements which they are sometimes obliged to fulfil and it is in the midst of such engagements that they are most likely to acquire or to preserve their virtues The habits of a vigorous  mind are formed in contending with difficulties not in enjoying the repose of a pacific station penetration and wisdom are the fruits of experience not the lessons of retirement and leisure ardour and generosity are the qualities of a mind roused and animated in the conduct of scenes that engage the heart not the gifts of reflection or knowledge The mere intermission of national and political efforts is notwithstanding sometimes mistaken for public good and there is no mistake more likely to foster the vices or to flatter the weakness of feeble and interested men  IF the ordinary arts of policy or rather if a growing indifference to objects of a public nature should prevail and under any free constitution put an end to those disputes of party and silence that noise of dissension which generally accompany the exercise of freedom we may venture to prognosticate corruption to the national manners as well as remissness to the national spirit The period is come when no engagement remaining on the part of the public private interest and animal pleasure become the sovereign objects of care When men being relieved from the pressure of great occasions bestow their attention on trifles and having carried what they are pleased to call  sensibility  and  delicacy  on the subject of ease or molestation as far as real weakness or folly can go have recourse to affectation in order to enhance the pretended demands and accumulate the anxieties of a sickly fancy and enfeebled mind  IN this condition mankind generally flatter their own imbecility under the name of  politeness  They are persuaded that the celebrated ardour  generosity and fortitude of former ages bordered on frenzy or were the mere effects of necessity on men who had not the means of enjoying their ease or their pleasure They congratulate themselves on having escaped the storm which required the exercise of such arduous virtues and with that vanity which accompanies the human race in their meanest condition they boast of a scene of affectation of languor or of folly as the standard of human felicity and as furnishing the properest exercise of a rational nature  IT is none of the least menacing symptoms of an age prone to degeneracy that the minds of men become perplexed in the discernment of merit as much as the spirit becomes enfeebled in conduct and the heart misled in the choice of its objects The care of mere fortune is supposed to constitute wisdom retirement from public affairs and real indifference to mankind receive the applauses of moderation and virtue  GREAT fortitude and elevation of mind have not always indeed been employed in the attainment of valuable ends but they are always respectable and they are always necessary when we would act for the good of mankind in any of the more arduous stations of life While therefore we blame their misapplication we should beware of depreciating their value Men of a severe and sententious morality have not always sufficiently observed this caution nor have they been duly aware of the corruptions they flattered by the satire they employed against what is aspiring and prominent in the character of the human soul  IT might have been expected that in an age of hopeless debasement  Juvenal's th satire  the talents of Demosthenes and Tully even the illgoverned magnanimity of a Macedonian or the daring enterprise of a Carthaginian leader might have escaped the acrimony of a satirist who had so many objects of correction in his view and who possessed the arts of declamation in so high a degree  I demens et saevos curre per Alpes  Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias  is part of the illiberal censure which is thrown by this poet on the person and action of a leader who by his courage and conduct in the very service to which the satire referred had well nigh saved his country from the ruin with which it was at last overwhelmed  Heroes are much the same the point's agreed  From Macedonia's madman to the Swede  is a distich in which another poet of beautiful talents has attempted to depreciate a name to which probably few of his readers are found to aspire  IF men must go wrong there is a choice of their very errors as well as of their virtues Ambition the love of personal eminence and the desire of fame although they sometimes lead to the commission of crimes yet always engage men in  pursuits that require to be supported by some of the greatest qualities of the human soul and if eminence is the principal object of pursuit there is at least a probability that those qualities may be studied on which a real elevation of mind is raised But when public alarms have ceased and contempt of glory is recommended as an article of wisdom the sordid habits and mercenary dispositions to which under a general indifference to national objects the members of a polished or commerical state are exposed must prove at once the most effectual suppression of every liberal sentiment and the most fatal reverse of all those principles from which communities derive their hopes of preservation and their strength  IT is noble to possess happiness and independence either in retirement or in public life The Characteristic of the happy is to acquit themselves well in every condition in the court or in the village in the senate or in the private retreat But if they affect any particular station it is surely that in which their actions may be rendered most extensively useful Our considering mere retirement therefore as a symptom of moderation and of virtue is either a remnant of that system under which monks and anchorets in former ages have been canonized or proceeds from a habit of thinking which appears equally fraught with moral corruption from our considering public life as a scene for the gratification of mere vanity avarice and ambition never as furnishing the best opportunity for a just and a happy engagement of the mind and the heart  EMULATION and the desire of power are but sorry motives to public conduct but if they have been in any case the principal inducements from which men have taken part in the service of their country any diminution of their prevalence or force is a real corruption of national manners and the pretended moderation assumed by the higher orders of men has a fatal effect in the state The disinterested love of the public is a principle without which some constitutions of government cannot subsist but when we consider how seldom this has appeared a reigning passion we have little reason to impute the prosperity or preservation of nations in every case to its influence  IT is sufficient perhaps under one form of government that men should be fond of their independence that they should be ready to oppose usurpation and to repel personal indignities under another it is sufficient that they should be tenacious of their rank and of their honours and instead of a zeal for the public entertain a vigilant jealousy of the rights which pertain to themselves When numbers of men retain a certain degree of elevation and fortitude they are qualified to give a mutual check to their several errors and are able to act in that variety of situations which the different constitutions of government have prepared for their members but under the disadvantages of a feeble spirit however directed and however informed no national constitution is safe nor can any degree of enlargement to which a state has arrived secure its political welfare  IN states where property distinction and pleasure are thrown out as baits to the imagination and incentives to passion the public seems to rely for the preservation of its political life on the degree of emulation and jealousy with which parties mutually oppose and restrain each other The desires of preferment and profit in the breast of the citizen are the motives from which he is excited to enter on public affairs and are the considerations which direct his political conduct The suppression therefore of ambition of partyanimosity and of public envy is probably in every such case not a reformation but a symptom of weakness and a prelude to more sordid pursuits and ruinous amusements  ON the eve of such a revolution in manners the higher ranks in every mixed or monarchical government have need to take care of themselves Men of business and of industry in the inferior stations of life retain their occupations and are secured by a kind of necessity in the possession of those habits on which they rely for their quiet and for the moderate enjoyments of life But the higher orders of men if they relinquish the state if they cease to possess that courage and elevation of mind and to exercise those talents which are employed in its defence and its government are in reality by the seeming advantages of their station become the refuse of that society of which they once were the ornament and from being the most respectable and the most happy of its members are become the most wretched and corrupt In their approach to this condition and in the absence of every manly occupation they feel a  dissatisfaction and languor which they cannot explain They pine in the midst of apparent enjoyments or by the variety and caprice of their different pursuits and amusements exhibit a state of agitation which like the disquiet of sickness is not a proof of enjoyment or pleasure but of suffering and pain The care of his buildings his equipage or his table is chosen by one literary amusement or some frivolous study by another The sports of the country and the diversions of the town the gamingtable  These different occupations differ from each other in respect to their dignity and their innocence but none of them are the schools from which men are brought to sustain the tottering fortune of nations they are equally avocations from what ought to be the principal pursuit of man the good of mankind  dogs horses and wine are employed to fill up the blank of a listless and unprofitable life They speak of human pursuits as if the whole difficulty were to find something to do They fix on some frivolous occupation as if there was nothing that deserved to be done They consider what tends to the good of their fellowcreatures as a disadvantage to themselves They fly from every scene in which any efforts of vigour are required or in which they might be allured to perform any service to their country We misapply our compassion in pitying the poor it were much more justly applied to the rich who become the first victims of that wretched insignificance into which the members of every corrupted state by the tendency of their weaknesses and their vices are in haste to plunge themselves  IT is in this condition that the sensual invent all those refinements on pleasure and devise those  incentives to a satiated appetite which tend to foster the corruptions of a dissolute age The effects of brutal appetite and the mere debauch are more flagrant and more violent perhaps in rude ages than they are in the later periods of commerce and luxury but that perpetual habit of searching for animal pleasure where it is not to be found in the gratifications of an appetite that is cloyed and among the ruins of an animal constitution is not more fatal to the virtues of the soul than it is even to the enjoyment of sloth or of pleasure it is not a more certain avocation from public affairs or a surer prelude to national decay than it is a disappointment to our hopes of private felicity  IN these reflections it has been the object not to ascertain a precise measure to which corruption has risen in any of the nations that have attained to eminence or that have gone to decay but to describe that remissness of spirit that weakness of soul that state of national debility which is likely to end in political slavery an evil which remains to be considered as the last object of caution and beyond which there is no subject of disquisition in the perishing fortunes of nations  SECT V  Of Corruption as it tends to Political Slavery  LIBERTY in one sense appears to be the portion of polished nations alone The savage is personally free because he lives unrestrained and acts with the members of his tribe on terms of equality The barbarian is frequently independent from a continuance of the same circumstances or because he has courage and a sword But good policy alone can provide for the regular administration of justice or constitute a force in the state which is ready on every occasion to defend the rights of its members  IT has been found that except in a few singular cases the commercial and political arts have advanced together These arts have been in modern Europe so interwoven that we cannot determine which were prior in the order of time or derived most advantage from the mutual influences with which they act and react upon one another It has been observed that in some nations the spirit of commerce intent on securing its profits has led the way to political wisdom A people possessed of wealth and become jealous of their properties have formed the project of emancipation and have proceeded under favour of an importance recently gained still farther to enlarge their pretensions and to dispute the prerogatives which their sovereign had been in use to employ But it is in vain that we expect in one age from the possession of wealth the fruit which it is said to have borne in a former Great accessions of fortune when recent when accompanied with frugality  and a sense of independence may render the owner confident in his strength and ready to spurn at oppression The purse which is open not to personal expence or to the indulgence of vanity but to support the interests of a faction to gratify the higher passions of party render the wealthy citizen formidable to those who pretend to dominion but it does not follow that in a time of corruption equal or greater measures of wealth should operate to the same effect  ON the contrary when wealth is accumulated only in the hands of the miser and runs to waste from those of the prodigal when heirs of family find themselves straitened and poor in the midst of affluence when the cravings of luxury silence even the voice of party and faction when the hopes of meriting the rewards of compliance or the fear of losing what is held at discretion keep men in a state of suspense and anxiety when fortune in short instead of being considered as the instrument of a vigorous spirit becomes the idol of a covetous or a profuse of a rapacious or a timorous mind the foundation on which freedom was built may serve to support a tyranny and what in one age raised the pretensions and fostered the confidence of the subject may in another incline him to servility and furnish the price to be paid for his prostitutions Even those who in a vigorous age gave the example of wealth in the hands of the people becoming an occasion of freedom may in times of degeneracy verify likewise the maxim of Tacitus That the admiration of riches leads to despotical government  Est apud illos et opibus honos eoque unus imperitat  c  Tacitus de mor Ger c    MEN who have tasted of freedom and who have felt their personal rights are not easily taught to bear with incroachments on either and cannot without some preparation come to submit to oppression They may receive this unhappy preparation under different forms of government from different hands and arrive at the same end by different ways▪ They follow one direction in republics another in monarchies and in mixed governments But whereever the state has by means that do not preserve the virtue of the subject effectually guarded his safety remissness and neglect of the public are likely to follow and polished nations of every description appear to encounter a danger on this quarter proportioned to the degree in which they have during any continuance enjoyed the uninterrupted possession of peace and prosperity  LIBERTY results we say from the government of laws and we are apt to consider statutes not merely as the resolutions and maxims of a people determined to be free not as the writings by which their rights are kept on record but as a power erected to guard them and as a barrier which the caprice of man cannot transgress  WHEN a Basha in Asia pretends to decide every controversy by the rules of natural equity we allow that he is possessed of discretionary powers When a judge in Europe is left to decide according to his own interpretation of written laws is he in any sense more restrained than the former Have the multiplied words of a statute an influence over the conscience and the heart more powerful than that of reason and nature Does the party in any judicial proceeding enjoy a less degree  of safety when his rights are discussed on the foundation of a rule that is open to the understandings of mankind than when they are referred to an intricate system which it has become the object of a separate profession to study and to explain  IF forms of proceeding written statutes or other constituents of law cease to be enforced by the very spirit from which they arose they serve only to cover not to restrain the iniquities of power they are possibly respected even by the corrupt magistrate when they favour his purpose but they are contemned or evaded when they stand in his way And the influence of laws where they have any real effect in the preservation of liberty is not any magic power descending from shelves that are loaded with books but is in reality the influence of men resolved to be free of men who having adjusted in writing the terms on which they are to live with the state and with their fellowsubjects are determined by their vigilance and spirit to make these terms be observed  WE are taught under every form of government to apprehend usurpations from the abuse or from the extension of the executive power In pure monarchies this power is commonly hereditary and made to descend in a determinate line In elective monarchies it is held for life In republics it is exercised during a limited time Where men or families are called by election to the possession of temporary dignities it is more the object of ambition to perpetuate than to extend their powers In hereditary monarchies the sovereignty is already perpetual and the aim of every ambitious prince is to enlarge his prerogative Rebublics and in times of commotion communities  of every form are exposed to hazard not from those only who are formally raised to places of trust but from every person whatever who is incited by ambition and who is supported by faction  IT is no advantage to a prince or other magistrate to enjoy more power than is consistent with the good of mankind nor is it of any benefit to a man to be unjust but these maxims are a feeble security against the passions and follies of men Those who are intrusted with any measures of influence are disposed from a mere aversion to constraint to remove opposition Not only the monarch who wears a hereditary crown but the magistrate who holds his office for a limited time grows fond of his dignity The very minister who depends for his place on the momentary will of his prince and whose personal interests are in every respect those of a subject still has the weakness to take an interest in the growth of prerogative and to reckon as gain to himself the incroachments he has made on the rights of a people with whom he himself and his family are soon to be numbered  EVEN with the best intentions towards mankind we are inclined to think that their welfare depends not on the felicity of their own inclinations or the happy employment of their own talents but on their ready compliance with what we have devised for their good Accordingly the greatest virtue of which any sovereign has hitherto shown an example is not a desire of cherishing in his people the spirit of freedom and independence but what is in itselfsufficiently rare and highly meritorious a steady regard to the distribution of  justice in matters of property a disposition to protect and to oblige to redress the grievances and to promote the interest of his subjects It was from a reference to these objects that Titus computed the value of his time and judged of its application But the sword which in this beneficent hand was drawn to protect the subject and to procure a speedy and effectual distribution of justice was likewise sufficient in the hands of a tyrant to shed the blood of the innocent and to cancel the rights of men The temporary proceedings of humanity though they suspended the exercise of oppression did not break the national chains the prince was even the better enabled to procure that species of good which he studied because there was no freedom remaining and because there was no where a force to dispute his decrees or to interrupt their execution  WAS it in vain that Antoninus became acquainted with the characters of Thrasea Helvidius Cato Dion and Brutus Was it in vain that he learned to understand the form of a free community raised on the basis of equality and justice or of a monarchy under which the liberties of the subject were held the most sacred object of administration  M Antoninus lib  Did he mistake the means of procuring to mankind what he points out as a blessing Or did the absolute power with which he was furnished in a mighty empire only disable him from executing what his mind had perceived as a national good In such a case it were vain to flatter the monarch or his people The first cannot bestow liberty without raising a spirit which may on occasion stand in opposition to his  own designs nor the latter receive this blessing while they own that it is in the right of a master to give or to withhold it The claim of justice is firm and peremptory We receive favours with a sense of obligation and kindness but we would inforce our rights and the spirit of freedom in this exertion cannot take the tone of supplication or of thankfulness without betraying itself  You have intreated Octavius  says Brutus to Cicero  that he would spare those who stand foremost among the citizens of Rome What if he will not Must we perish Yes rather than owe our safety to him  LIBERTY is a right which every individual must be ready to vindicate for himself and which he who pretends to bestow as a favour has by that very act in reality denied Even political establishments though they appear to be independent of the will and arbitration of men cannot be relied on for the preservation of freedom they may nourish but should not supersede that firm and resolute spirit with which the liberal mind is always prepared to resist indignities and to refer its safety to itself  WERE a nation therefore given to be moulded by a sovereign as the clay is put into the hands of the potter this project of bestowing liberty on a people who are actually servile is perpaps of all others the most difficult and requires most to be executed in silence and with the deepest reserve Men are qualified to receive this blessing only in proportion as they are made to apprehend their own rights and are made to respect the just pretensions of mankind in proportion as they are willing to sustain in their own  persons the burden of government and of national defence and are willing to prefer the engagements of a liberal mind to the enjoyments of sloth or the delusive hopes of a safety purchased by submission and fear  I SPEAK with respect and if I may be allowed the expression even with indulgence to those who are intrusted with high prerogatives in the political system of nations It is indeed seldom their fault that states are inslaved What should be expected from them but that being actuated by human desires they should be averse to disappointment or even to delay and in the ardour with which they pursue their object that they should break through the barriers that would stop their career If millions recede before single men and senates are passive as if composed of members who had no opinion or sense of their own on whose side have the defences of freedom given way or to whom shall we impute their fall to the subject who has deserted his station or to the sovereign who has only remained in his own and who if the collateral or subordinate members of government shall cease to question his power must continue to govern without any restraint  IT is well known that constitutions framed for the preservation of liberty must consist of many parts and that senates popular assemblies courts of justice magistrates of different orders must combine to balance each other while they exercise sustain or check the executive power If any part is struck out the fabric must totter or fall if any member is remiss the others must incroach In assemblies constituted by men of different talents habits and apprehensions it were something more  than human that could make them agree in every point of importance having different opinions and views it were want of integrity to abstain from disputes our very praise of unanimity therefore is to be considered as a danger to liberty We wish for it at the hazard of taking in its place the remissness of men grown indifferent to the public the venality of those who have sold the rights of their country or the servility of others who give implicit obedience to a leader by whom their minds are subdued The love of the public and respect to its laws are the points in which mankind are bound to agree but if in matters of controversy the sense of any individual or party is invariably pursued the cause of freedom is already betrayed  HE whose office it is to govern a supine or an abject people cannot for a moment cease to extend his powers Every execution of law every movement of the state every civil and military operation in which his power is exerted must serve to confirm his authority and present him to the view of the public as the sole object of consideration fear and respect Those very establishments which were devised in one age to limit or to direct the exercise of an executive power will serve in another to settle its foundations and to give it stability they will point out the channels in which it may run without giving offence or without exciting alarms and the very councils which were instituted to check its incroachments will in time of corruption furnish an aid to its usurpations  THE passion for independence and the love of dominion frequently arise from a common source There is in both an aversion to controul and  he who in one situation cannot brook a superior must in another dislike to be joined with an equal  WHAT the prince under a pure or limited monarchy is by the constitution of his country the leader of a faction would willingly become in republican governments If he attains to this envied condition his own inclination or the tendency of human affairs seem to open before him the career of a royal ambition but the circumstances in which he is destined to act are very different from those of a king He encounters with men who are unused to disparity he is obliged for his own security to hold the dagger continually unsheathed When he hopes to be safe possibly means to be just but is hurried from the first moment of his usurpation into every exercise of despotical power The heir of a crown has no such quarrel to maintain with his subjects his situation is flattering and the heart must be uncommonly bad that does not glow with affection to a people who are at once his admirers his support and the ornaments of his reign In him perhaps there is no explicit design of trespassing on the rights of his subjects but the forms intended to preserve their freedom are not on this account always safe in his hands  SLAVERY has been imposed upon mankind in the wantonness of a depraved ambition and tyrannical cruelties have been committed in the gloomy hours of jealousy and terror yet these demons are not necessary to the creation or to the support of an arbitrary power Although no policy was ever more successful than that of the Roman republic in maintaining a national fortune yet subjects as well as their princes frequently imagine  that freedom is a clog on the proceedings of government they imagine that despotical power is best fitted to procure dispatch and secrecy in the execution of public councils to maintain what they are pleased to call  political order  Our notion of order in civil society is frequently false it is taken from the analogy of subjects inanimate and dead we consider commotion and action as contrary to its nature we think it consistent only with obedience secrecy and the silent passing of affairs through the hands of a few The good order of stones in a wall is their being properly fixed in the places for which they are hewn were they to stir the building must fall but the good order of men in society is their being placed where they are properly qualified to act The first is a fabric made of dead and inanimate parts the second is made of living and active members When we seek in society for the order of mere inaction and tranquility we forget the nature of our subject and find the order of slaves not that of free men  and to give a speedy redress of complaints They even sometimes acknowledge that if a succession of good princes could be found despotical government is best calculated for the happiness of mankind While they reason thus they cannot blame a sovereign who in the confidence that he is to employ his power for good purposes endeavours to extend its limits and in his own apprehension strives only to shake off the restraints which stand in the way of reason and which prevent the effect of his friendly intentions  THUS prepared for usurpation let him at the head of a free state employ the force with which he is armed to crush the seeds of apparent disorder in every corner of his dominions let him effectually curb the spirit of dissension and variance among his people let him remove the interruptions to government arising from the refractory humours and the private interests of his subjects  let him collect the force of the state against its enemies by availing himself of all it can furnish in the way of taxation and personal service it is extremely probable that even under the direction of wishes for the good of mankind he may break through every barrier of liberty and establish a despotism while he flatters himself that he only follows the dictates of sense and propriety  WHEN we suppose government to have bestowed a degree of tranquility which we sometimes hope to reap from it as the best of its fruits and public affairs to proceed in the several departments of legislation and execution with the least possible interruption to commerce and lucrative arts such a state like that of China by throwing affairs into separate offices where conduct consists in detail and in the observance of forms by superseding all the exertions of a great or a liberal mind is more akin to despotism than we are apt to imagine  WHETHER oppression injustice and cruelty are the only evils which attend on despotical government may be considered apart In the mean time it is sufficient to observe that liberty is never in greater danger than it is when we measure national felicity by the blessings which a prince may bestow or by the mere tranquility which may attend on equitable administration The sovereign may dazzle with his heroic qualities he may protect his subjects in the enjoyment of every animal advantage or pleasure but the benefits arising from liberty are of a different sort they are not the fruits of a virtue and of a goodness which operate in the breast of one man but the communication of virtue itself to many and such a distribution  of functions in civil society as gives to numbers the exercises and occupations which pertain to their nature  THE best constitutions of government are attended with inconvenience and the exercise of liberty may on many occasions give rise to complains When we are intent on reforming abuses the abuses of freedom may lead us to incroach on the subject from which they are supposed to arise Despotism itself has certain advantages or at least in times of civility and moderation may proceed with so little offence as to give no public alarm These circumstances may lead mankind in the very spirit of reformation or by mere inattention to apply or to admit of dangerous innovations in the state of their policy  SLAVERY however is not always introduced by mere mistake it is sometimes imposed in the spirit of violence and rapine Princes become corrupt as well as their people and whatever may have been the origin of despotical government its pretensions when fully explained give rise to a contest between the sovereign and his subjects which force alone can decide These pretensions have a dangerous aspect to the person the property or the life of every subject they alarm every passion in the human breast they disturb the supine they deprive the venal of his hire they declare war on the corrupt as well as the virtuous they are tamely admitted only by the coward but even to him must be supported by a force that can work on his fears This force the conqueror brings from abroad and the domestic usurper endeavours to find in his faction at home  WHEN a people is accustomed to arms it is difficult for a part to subdue the whole or before the establishment of disciplined armies it is difficult for any usurper to govern the many by the help of a few These difficulties however the policy of civilized and commercial nations has sometimes removed and by forming a distinction between civil and military professions by committing the keeping and the enjoyment of liberty to different hands has prepared the way for the dangerous alliance of faction with military power in opposition to mere political forms and the rights of mankind  A PEOPLE who are disarmed in compliance with this fatal refinement have rested their safety on the pleadings of reason and justice at the tribunal of ambition and of sorce In such an extremity laws are quoted and senates are assembled in vain They who compose a legislature or who occupy the civil departments of state may deliberate on the messages they receive from the camp or the court but if the bearer like the centurion who brought the petition of Octavius to the Roman senate shew the hilt of his sword  Sueton  they find that petitions are become commands and that they themselves are become the pageants not the repositories of sovereign power  THE reflections of this section may be unequally applied to nations of unequal extent Small communities however corrupted are not prepared for despotical government their members crouded together and contiguous to the seats of power never forget their relation to the public they pry with habits of familiarity and freedom into the  pretensions of those who would rule and where the love of equality and the sense of justice have failed they act on motives of faction emulation and envy The exiled Tarquin had his adherents at Rome but if by their means he had recovered his station it is probable that in the exercise of his royalty he must have entered on a new scene of contention with the very party that restored him to power  IN proportion as territory is extended its parts lose their relative importance to the whole Its inhabitants cease to perceive their connection with the state and are seldom united in the execution of any national or even of any factious designs Distance from the seats of administration and indifference to the persons who contend for preferment teach the majority to consider themselves as the subjects of a sovereignty not as the members of a political body It is even remarkable that enlargement of territory by rendering the individual of less consequence to the public and less able to intrude with his counsel actually tends to reduce national affairs within a narrower compass as well as to diminish the numbers who are consulted in legislation or in other matters of government  THE disorders to which a great empire is exposed require speedy prevention vigilance and quick execution Distant provinces must be kept in subjection by military force and the dictatorial powers which in free states are sometimes raised to quell insurrections or to oppose other occasional evils appear under a certain extent of dominion at all times equally necessary to suspend the dissolution of a body whose parts were assembled and must be cemented by measures forcible deci  and secret Among the circumstances therefore  which in the event of national prosperity and in the result of commercial arts lead to the establishment of despotism there is none perhaps that arrives at this termination with so sure an aim as the perpetual enlargement of territory In every state the freedom of its members depends on the balance and adjustment of its interior parts and the existence of any such freedom among mankind depends on the balance of nations In the progress of conquest those who are subdued are said to have lost their liberties but from the history of mankind to conquer or to be conquered has appeared in effect the same  SECT VI  Of the Progress and Termination of Despotism  MANKIND when they degenerate and tend to their ruin as well as when they improve and gain real advantages frequently proceed by slow and almost insensible steps If during ages of activity and vigour they fill up the measure of national greatness to a height which no human wisdom could at a distance foresee they actually incur in ages of relaxation and weakness many evils which their fears did not suggest and which perhaps they had thought far removed by the tide of success and prosperity  WE have already observed that where men are remiss or corrupted the virtue of their leaders or the good intention of their magistrates will not always secure them in the possession of political freedom Implicit submission to any leader or the uncontrouled exercise of any power even when it is  intended to operate for the good of mankind may frequently end in the subversion of legal establishments This fatal revolution by whatever means it is accomplished terminates in military government and this though the simplest of all governments is rendered complete by degrees In the first period of its exercise over men who have acted as members of a free community it can have only laid the foundation not completed the fabric of a despotical policy The usurper who has possessed with an army the centre of a great empire sees around him perhaps the shattered remains of a former constitution he may hear the murmurs of a reluctant and unwilling submission he may even see danger in the aspect of many from whose hands he may have wrested the sword but whose minds he has not subdued nor reconciled to his power  THE sense of personal rights or the pretension to privilege and honours which remain among certain orders of men are so many bars in the way of a recent usurpation If they are not suffered to decay with age and to wear away in the progress of a growing corruption they must be broken with violence and the entrance to every new accession of power must be stained with blood The effect even in this case is frequently tardy The Roman spirit we know was not entirely extinguished under a succession of masters and under a repeated application of bloodshed and poison The noble and respectable family still aspired to its original honours the history of the republic the writings of former times the monuments of illustrious men and the lessons of a philosophy fraught with heroic conceptions continued to nourish the soul in retirement and formed those eminent characters whose elevation  and whose fate are perhaps the most affecting subjects of human story Though unable to oppose the general bent to servility they became on account of their supposed inclinations objects of distrust and aversion and were made to pay with their blood the price of a sentiment which they fostered in silence and which glowed only in the heart  WHILE despotism proceeds in its progress by what principle is the sovereign conducted in the choice of measures that tend to establish his government By a mistaken apprehension of his own good sometimes even of that of his people and by the desire which he feels on every particular occasion to remove the obstructions which impede the execution of his will When he has fixed a resolution whoever reasons or demonstrates against it is an enemy when his mind is elated whoever pretends to erninence and is disposed to act for himself is a rival He would leave no dignity in the state but what is dependent on himself no active power but what carries the expression of his momentary pleasure Guided by a perception as unerring as that of instinct he never fails to select the proper objects of his antipathy or of his favour The aspect of independence repels him that of servility attracts The tendency of his administration is to quiet every restless spirit and to assume every function of government to himself  It is ridiculous to hear men of a restless ambition who would be the only actors in every scene sometimes complain of a refractory spirit in mankind as if the same disposition from which they desire to usurp every office did not incline every other person to reason and to act at least for himself  When the power is adequate to the end it operates as much in the hands of those who do not perceive the termination  as it does in the hands of others by whom it is best understood the mandates of either when just should not be disputed when erroneous or wrong they are supported by force  YOU must die was the answer of Octavius to every suit from a people that implored his mercy It was the sentence which some of his successors pronounced against every citizen that was eminent for his birth or his virtues But are the evils of despotism confined to the cruel and sanguinary methods by which a recent dominion over a refractory and a turbulent people is established or maintained And is death the greatest calamity which can afflict mankind under an establishment by which they are divested of all their rights They are indeed frequently suffered to live but distrust and jealousy the sense of personal meanness and the anxieties which arise from the care of a wretched interest are made to possess the soul every citizen is reduced to a slave and every charm by which the community engaged its members has ceased to exist Obedience is the only duty that remains and this is exacted by force If under such an establishment it be necessary to witness scenes of debasement and horror at the hazard of catching the infection death becomes a relief and the libation which Thrasea was made to pour from his arteries is to be considered as a proper sacrifice of gratitude to Jove the Deliverer  Porrectisque utriusque brachii venis postquam cruorem effudit humum super spargens proprius vocato Quaestore  Libemus  inquit  Jovi Liberatori  Specta juvenis et omen quidem Dii prohibeant ceterum in ea tempora natus es quibus firmare animum deceat constantibus exemplis  Tacit Ann lib    OPPRESSION and cruelty are not always necessary to despotical government and even when present are but a part of its evils It is founded on corruption and on the suppression of all the civil and the political virtues it requires its subjects to act from motives of fear it would asswage the passions of a few men at the expence of mankind and would erect the peace of society itself on the ruins of that freedom and confidence from which alone the enjoyment the force and the elevation of the human mind are found to arise  DURING the existence of any free constitution and whilst every individual possessed his rank and his privilege or had his apprehension of personal rights the members of every community were to one another objects of consideration and of respect every point to be carried in civil society required the exercise of talents of wisdom persuasion and vigour as well as of power But it is the highest refinement of a despotical government to rule by simple commands and to exclude every art but that of compulsion Under the influence of this policy therefore the occasions which employed and cultivated the understandings of men which awakened their sentiments and kindled their imaginations are gradually removed and the progress by which mankind attained to the honours of their nature in being engaged to act in society upon a liberal footing was not more uniform or less interrupted than that by which they degenerate in this unhappy condition  WHEN we hear of the silence which reigns in the seraglio we are made to believe that speech itself is become unnecessary and that the signs of the mute are sufficient to carry the most important  mandates of government No arts indeed are required to maintain an ascendant where terror alone is opposed to force where the powers of the sovereign are delegated entire to every subordinate officer nor can any station bestow a liberality of mind in a scene of silence and dejection where every breast is possessed with jealousy and caution and where no object but animal pleasure remains to balance the sufferings of the sovereign himself or those of his subjects  IN other states the talents of men are sometimes improved by the exercises which belong to an eminent station but here the master himself is probably the rudest and least cultivated animal of the herd he is inferior to the slave whom he raises from a servile office to the first places of trust or of dignity in his court The primitive simplicity which formed ties of familiarity and affection betwixt the sovereign and the keeper of his herds  See Odyssey  appears in the absence of all affections to be restored or to be counterfeited amidst the ignorance and brutality which equally characterise all orders of men or rather which level the ranks and destroy the distinction of persons in a despotical court  CAPRICE and passion are the rules of government with the prince Every delegate of power is left to act by the same direction to strike when he is provoked to favour when he is pleased In what relates to revenue jurisdiction or police every governor of a province acts like a leader in an enemy's country comes armed with the terrors of fire and sword and instead of a tax levies a contribution by force he ruins or spares as either  may serve his purpose When the clamours of the oppressed or the reputation of a treasure amassed at the expence of a province have reached the ears of the sovereign the extortioner is indeed made to purchase impunity by imparting a share or by forfeiting the whole of his spoil but no reparation is made to the injured nay the crimes of the minister are first employed to plunder the people and afterwards punished to fill the coffers of the sovereign  IN this total discontinuance of every art that relates to just government and national policy it is remarkable that even the trade of the soldier is itself greatly neglected Distrust and jealousy on the part of the prince come in aid of his ignorance and incapacity and these causes operating together serve to destroy the very foundation on which his power is established Any undisciplined rout of armed men passes for an army whilst a weak dispersed and unarmed people are sacrificed to military disorder or exposed to depredation on the frontier from an enemy whom the desire of spoil or the hopes of conquest may have drawn to their neighbourhood  THE Romans extended their empire till they left no polished nation to be subdued and found a frontier which was every where surrounded by fierce and barbarous tribes they even pierced through uncultivated deserts in order to remove to a greater distance the molestation of such troublesome neighbours and in order to possess the avenues through which they feared their attacks But this policy put the finishing hand to the internal corruption of the state A few years of tranquility were sufficient to make even the government forget its danger and in the cultivated province prepared  for the enemy a tempting prize and an easy victory  WHEN by the conquest and annexation of every rich and cultivated province the measure of empire is full two parties are sufficient to comprehend mankind that of the pacific and the wealthy who dwell within the pale of empire and that of the poor the rapacious and the fierce who are inured to depredation and war The last bear to the first nearly the same relation which the wolf and the lion bear to the fold and they are naturally engaged in a state of hostility  WERE despotic empire meantime to continue for ever unmolested from abroad while it retains that corruption on which it was founded it appears to have in itself no principle of new life and presents no hope of restoration to freedom and political vigour That which the despotical  master has sown    cannot quicken unless it die  it must languish and expire by the effect of its own abuse before the human spirit can spring up anew or bear those fruits which constitute the honour and the felicity of human nature In times of the greatest debasement indeed commotions are felt but very unlike the agitations of a free people they are either the agonies of nature under the sufferings to which men are exposed or mere tumults confined to a few who stand in arms about the prince and who by their conspiracies assassinations and murders serve only to plunge the pacific inhabitant still deeper in the horrors of fear or despair Scattered in the provinces unarmed unacquainted with the sentiments of union and confederacy restricted by habit to a wretched oeconomy  and dragging a precarious life on those possessions which the extortions of government have left the people can no where under these circumstances assume the spirit of a community nor form any liberal combination for their own defence The injured may complain and while he cannot obtain the mercy of government he may implore the commiseration of his fellowsubject But that fellowsubject is comforted that the hand of oppression has not seized on himself he studies his interest or snatches his pleasure under that degree of safety which obscurity and concealment bestow  THE commercial arts which seem to require no foundation in the minds of men but the regard to interest no encouragement but the hopes of gain and the secure possession of property must perish under the precarious tenure of slavery and under the apprehension of danger arising from the reputation of wealth National poverty however and the suppression of commerce are the means by which despotism comes to accomplish its own destruction Where there are no longer any profits to corrupt or fears to deter the charm of dominion is broken and the naked slave as awake from a dream is astonished to find he is free When the fence is destroyed the wilds are open and the herd breaks loose The pasture of the cultivated field is no longer preferred to that of the desert The sufferer willingly flies where the extortions of government cannot overtake him where even the timid and the servile may recollect they are men where the tyrant may threaten but where he is known to be no more than a fellowcreature where he can take nothing but life and even this at the hazard of his own  AGREEABLY to this description the vexations of tyranny have overcome in many parts of the East the desire of settlement The inhabitants of a village quit their habitations and infest the public ways those of the valleys fly to the mountains and equipt for flight or possessed of a strong hold subsist by depredation and by the war they make on their former masters  THESE disorders conspire with the impositions of government to render the remaining settlements still less secure but while devastation and ruin appear on every side mankind are forced anew upon those confederacies acquire again that personal confidence and vigour that social attachment that use of arms which in former times rendered a small tribe the seed of a great nation and which may again enable the emancipated slave to begin the career of civil and commercial arts When human nature appears in the utmost state of corruption it has actually begun to reform  IN this manner the scenes of human life have been frequently shifted Security and presumption forfeit the advantages of prosperity resolution and conduct retrieve the ills of adversity and mankind while they have nothing on which to rely but their virtue are prepared to gain every advantage and when they confide most in their fortune are most exposed to feel its reverse We are apt to draw these observations into rule and when we are no longer willing to act for our country we plead in excuse of our own weakness or folly a supposed fatality in human affairs  THE institutions of men are indeed likely to have their end as well as their beginning but their duration is not fixed to any limited period and no nation ever suffered internal decay but from the vice of its members We are sometimes willing to acknowledge this vice in our countrymen but who was ever willing to acknowledge it in himself It may be suspected however that we do more than acknowledge it when we cease to oppose its effects and when we plead a fatality which at least in the breast of every individual is dependent on himself Men of real fortitude integrity and ability are well placed in every scene they reap in every condition the principal enjoyments of their nature they are the happy instruments of providence employed for the good of mankind or if we must change this language they show that while they are destined to live the states they compose are likewise doomed by the sates to survive and to prosper  THE END
