****** esq in the year  But it is not enough that the Laws of England exclude  Slavery  merely  from this island  whilst the grand Enemy of man∣kind triumphs in a toleration  throughout our Colonies  of the most monstrous  op∣pression  to which human nature can be subjected  And yet this abominable wickedness has not wanted advocates who in a va∣riety of late publications have attempted to palliate the guilt and have even ven∣tured to appeal to Scripture for the sup∣port of their uncharitable pretensions so that I am laid under a double obliga∣tion to answer them because it is not the cause of  Liberty  alone for which I now contend but for that which I have still much more at heart the honour of the holy Scriptures the principles of which are entirely opposite to the selfish and  uncharitable pretensions of our American Slaveholders and African Traders  A late anonymous writer who calls himself  "An African Merchant"  re∣marks that  By the Law of Moses the Israelites might purchase Slaves from the Heathens and even their own people might become Slaves to their brethren  A Treatise on the Trade from GreatBritain to Africa c by an African Merchant P    and    Now with respect to the first part of his observation it is true indeed that the Israelites were expressly permitted to keep BondServants or Slaves  of the  Heathen  or more properly of the  Nations  that  were round about  them  and of  the children of the stran∣gers that sojourned among  them Levit xxv to But we must re∣member that these  Heathen  or  Na∣tions  that were round about them  were an abandoned race of people already  Slaves  and  worshippers  of devils and by them led to debase  human nature  and to pollute themselves with the most un∣natural and abominable vices  For in all these  said the Almighty  the nations are defiled which I cast out before you and the Land is defiled THEREFORE I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vo∣miteth out her inhabitants  c  Again  For all these abominations have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defi∣led  c  See Levit xviii And the  "children of the strangers"  abovemen∣tioned were probably also of the same detestable nations of Palestine the Amo∣rites Canaanites  c  which were ex∣pressly doomed to destruction    Observe thou that which I command thee this day behold I drive out before thee the Amo∣rite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite Take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee  c  Exod xxxiv and  and  that by the hand of the Israelites  who were commanded to shew them no pity    And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee thine eye shall have  no pity upon them  c  Deut vii  The Lord thy God will put out those nations by little and little  c  The Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a migh∣ty destruction until they be destroyed And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them  Deut vii and    But no doctrine must be drawn from these commands to  execute God's vengeance  upon the said wicked  strangers  without considering at the same time  that very contrary treatment of strangers  which was  equally  enjoined in the Law for the Israelites were positively commanded not to  vex  or  oppress a Stranger  Thou  shalt love him as thyself  said Moses by the express command of God  If a Stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye  shall not vex  or  oppress    him But  the Stranger  that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you and  thou shalt love him as thyself  for ye were  Strangers  in the land of Egypt  Levit xix And again  The Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a terrible which  regardeth not persons  nor taketh reward he doth execute the judgement of the fatherless and widow and  loveth the Stranger  in giving him food and rai∣ment  Love ye  therefore  the Stran∣ger  for ye  were Strangers  in the land of Egypt  Deut x to In all these passages and many others the Is∣raelites were reminded of their  Bondage in Egypt  for so the almighty  Deli∣verer  from  Slavery  warned his people  to  limit  and moderate the  bondage  which the Law permitted by the remembrance of  their own former bondage  in a foreign land and by a remembrance also of his great mercy  in delivering them  from that  bondage  and he expressly referred them to  their own feelings  as they themselves had experienced the intolerable yoke of Egyptian Tyranny  Thou shalt not  oppress a Stranger  for ye know the heart of  a stranger  seeing ye were  strangers  in the land of Egypt  Exod xxiii And again  Thou shalt remember that  thou  wast  a Bondman  in the land of Egypt and the Lord thy God  redeemed thee  Deut xv  We must therefore necessarily con∣clude when these very opposite com∣mands are considered that the  Heathen  or  nations  that were "ROUND ABOUT" or in the  environs  of the promised land and also the  children of the strangers  that  dwelt among them mentioned at the same time whom the Israelites were per∣mitted to retain  in perpetual bondage  were not intended to be included and ranked under that general denomination of  Strangers  to whom so much real  af∣fection benevolence  and  consideration  are strictly commanded in the texts to which I have just now referred And consequently it must be allowed that the particular nations the seven nations of Palestine see Deut vii which were expressly devoted to destruction were the only  Strangers  whom the Jews were permitted to hold in  absolute Slavery  so that the wicked practice of  enslaving  the poor  African Negroes  would have been as  unlawful  under the Jewish Dispensation as it certainly is now adays to Englishmen and other sub∣jects of GreatBritain that profess  the Christian Religion in whose consideration  ALL STRANGERS from every  other part of the world are without doubt entitled to be ranked esteemed and beloved  as brethren  which I have elsewhere particularly demonstrated and which even the law of Moses expressly commanded  But  the stranger  that dwelleth with you shall be unto you  as one born among you  and THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS THY∣SELF for  ye were strangers  in the land of Egypt I am the Lord your God  Levit xix and  This excellent system of benevolence to  strangers  which the Israelites were so strictly enjoined to observe cannot I ap∣prehend be otherwise reconciled with the permission to the Israelites of retaining in perpetual bondage  the heathen that were round about them  and the children of  the strangers  that sojourned among them for if this permission were to be ex∣tended to  strangers in general  it would  subvert the express command concerning  brotherly love  due to  strangers  because a man cannot be said  to love the stranger as himself  if he holds  the stranger  and his pro∣geny in a perpetual  involuntary servitude  The observation therefore of the African Merchant that  THE ISRAELITES  might purchase Slaves from the heathens  will by no means justify the  enslaving  of  mo∣dern heathens  by  Englishmen  or by any other nation now subsisting The Israel∣ites at that time might not only purchase Slaves of those particular heathen nations but they might also  drive out these hea∣then  I mean these which were particu∣larly named nay even  kill    But of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance thou  shalt save alive nothing that breatheth  Deut xx  and  ex∣tirpate  them and  take possession of their ci∣ties houses  and  lands  All these acts of violence  might  the Israelites do  without sin  though the like would justly be esteemed  murder  and  robbery  if practised by any other nation not under the like peculiar circumstances so that the example of the Israelites affords no excuse for the uncha∣ritable practices of the  African Merchant  and  WestIndia Planter  The Israelites had an express commission    Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him  Numbers xxxi This was the judgement against the Midianitish prisoners The seven nations of Palestine were likewise subjected to the same condemnation  Thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no cove∣nant with them  nor shew mercy unto them  Deut vii And a reason for this condemnation was plain∣ly delivered in the fourth verse to confirm the justice of it  For they will turn away thy son from follow∣ing me that they may serve other gods  The Amalekites were also doomed to destruction in the like manner  Thou shalt  blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget it  Deut xxv  to execute God's vengeance  without remorse    And thou shalt  consume all the people  which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee thine eye shall have  no pity  upon them Deut vii  upon several populous nations which had ren∣dered themselves  abominable in the sight of  God  and therefore deserved no consider∣ation so that  even mercy  in the Israelites was a sin    But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell Moreover it shall come to pass that  I shall do unto you  as  I thought to do unto them  Numb xxxiii and And the Israelites were expressly told that it was not on their own account that this extraordinary authority was put into their hands but on account of the  abominable wick∣edness  of those who possessed the promised land  The land is defiled therefore I do visit  the iniquity there∣of upon it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabit∣ants  Levit xviii  "For all these abominations" unnatural lusts mentioned in the former part of the same chapter  have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defiled  Levit xviii And the Israelites were warned against presumption lest such extraordinary authority should occasion spiritual pride  Not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart  dost thou  go to possess the land but for the  wickedness of those nations the Lord God doth drive them out from before thee  c  Deut ix  when it interfered with this positive command of God  The commission there given however was but  temporary  and no other nation  except God's peculiar people was char∣ged with the execution of it and there∣fore though the Europeans have taken upon themselves for a long time past  to attack destroy drive out dispossess and enslave  the poor ignorant  Heathen  in many distant parts of the world and may perhaps plead custom and prescrip∣tion to their shame be it said for their actions yet as they cannot like the Is∣raelites produce an  authentic written commandment from God  for such proceed∣ings the offenders can no otherwise be esteemed than as  lawless robbers  and  op∣pressors  who have reason to expect  a se∣vere retribution  from God for their tyran∣ny and oppression It is unreasonable therefore to suppose that the severe treat∣ment of the  ancient Heathen  by the Isra∣elites under  the dispensation of the Law  either in  killing dispossessing  or  enslaving  them should justify our  modern  acts of  violence  and  oppression  now that we profess obedience to the  Gospel of Peace  And with respect to the second part of the African Merchant's observation concerning the Israelites  viz  that even  their own people might become Slaves to their brethren  I must remark that he does not deal fairly by the Jewish Law to quote that circumstance with∣out mentioning at the same time  the Just Limitation  to which it was sub∣ject and the admirable provision in the same Law against  the involuntary servi∣tude of brethren  because no Hebrew could be made  a Slave  without  his own consent  and even  desire  which was to be  "plainly"  and  openly  declared in a court of  record    if the servant shall  plainly say  I love my master my wife and my children  I will not go out free  then  says the text  his master shall bring him  unto the Judges  c  whereby  an acknowledgement  in a court of re∣cord  is plainly implied  and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul and he shall serve him for ever  Exod xxi But without that  public ac∣knowledgement  of  voluntary consent before the Judges  the Hebrew master had no authority to bore the servant's ear  Yet our inconsiderate WestIndian and American Planters make no scruple even of  branding  their poor Negroservants with a  hot iron  to mark them  for per∣petual Bondmen against their will  though they are cer∣tainly their  Brethren  in the eyes of GOD But GOD hath declared  expressly  concerning the crimes of these men  who enslave the poor    SURELY  I will ne∣ver forget any of their works Shall not the land trem∣ble for this  c c c  Amos viii See also the whole context from the th verse  in token of bondage and in every other case it was  absolutely unlawful  for the Is∣raelite to hold a  Brother Israelite in Sla∣very  The Law expressly declares  If thy  Brother that dwelleth  by thee be waxen poor and  be sold unto thee thou shalt not  compel him to serve as a  bond servant but  as an  hired servant  and as a  sojourner  he shall be with thee  and  shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and  then  shall he depart from thee  both  he  and his chil∣dren  with him  c  and the reason of this command immediately follows "for they are  my servants  " said the Lord  which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt  i e  which God himself delivered from Slavery    they shall not be sold as Bondmen  thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but  shalt fear thy God  Levit xxv to And again in the th verse "For  unto me  " said the Lord  the children of  Israel are servants they are my servants  whom I brought out of the land of Egypt  I am the Lord your God  Thus it appears that the  involuntary servitude  of  brethren  is entirely inconsist∣ent with the Jewish Law which there∣fore  is so far from  justifying  the  African Merchant  that it absolutely  condemns  him But he is still more mistaken when he insinuates that Slavery is not inconsistent with the Gospel  Jesus Christ the Saviour of mankind and Founder of our religion  says he  left the moral laws and civil rights of mankind upon their old foundations his king∣dom was not of this world nor did he interfere with national laws  he did not repeal that of slaves  nor assert an universal freedom except from sin with him bond and free were accepted if they behaved  righteously  c  p  But how can a man be said to  behave  righteously  who sells his  brethren  or holds them in Slavery  against their will  For though with Christ  bond  and  free  are accepted  yet it behoves  the Afri∣can Merchant  very diligently to examine whether he is not likely to forfeit his  own  acceptance  if he does not most heartily repent of having  enslaved his brethren  and of having encouraged others to the same  uncharitable practices  by misinterpreting the holy Scriptures  Under the Gospel Dispensation  all man∣kind  are to be esteemed  our brethren  Christ commanded his disciples to go and teach or make disciples of  all nations  "  " Matth xxviii So that  men of all nations  who indeed were  brethren  before by  natural  descent from  one common father  are now undoubt∣edly capable of being doubly related to us by a  farther  tie of  of brotherhood  which the law of Moses seemed to deny them and of which the peculiar people of God jealous of their own adoption once thought them incapable I mean the inestimable privilege of becoming sons al∣so to  one almighty Father by adoption  as well as the Jews and consequently of  being  our brethren  through Christ by a  spiritual  as well as a  natural  relation∣ship  The promises of God likewise in eve∣ry other part of the New Testament are made to  all mankind in general with∣out exception  so that a Negro as well as any other man is capable of becoming  "an adopted son of God"  an  heir of God through Christ  "that we might receive the  adoption of  SONS" said the apostle to the Galatians  And because  ye are Sons  God hath sent forth the spirit of  his Son  into your hearts crying  Abba Father  wherefore thou art  no more a servant but a  SON and  if a Son  then AN HEIR OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST  Galat iv and  a  temple of the HolyGhost    Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the  Temple  of God  is holy  which  Tem∣ple ye are  Corinth iii See also chap vi    an heir    That the Gentiles should be  fellowheirs  and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ  by the Gospel  Ephes iii  of  salvation  a partaker of  the divine na∣ture    through the knowledge of him that hath called us to  glory  and  virtue  whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might  be partakers  of the  divine nature  c  Pet i and  "a  jointheir with Christ    If children then heirs heirs of God and jointheirs with Christ  c  Rom viii  and capable also of being joined to that glorious company of Saints who shall one day  "come with him to judge the world"  for "the  Saints shall judge the world  " Cor vi And therefore how can any man who calls himself a Chris∣tian presume to retain as a mere chattel or  private property  his fellow man and  brother  who is equally capable with himself of attaining the high dignities abovementioned Let Slaveholders be mindful of the approaching consumma∣tion of all earthly things when perhaps they will see thousands of those men who were formerly esteemed mere  chat∣tels  and  private property  coming    at the  coming  of our Lord JESUS CHRIST  with all his Saints  Thess iii    And Enoch also the seventh from Adam pro∣phesied of these saying Behold the Lord  cometh  with  ten thousands of his saints to execute judgement upon all  and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds  c  Jude xiv  in the clouds    and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory  Matt xxiv  Behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also  which pierced him  Rev i And those men also who have worn out their brethren in slavery may surely be ranked with the wretches that  pierced their Lord  in as much as ye have done it  unto one of the least of these my brethren  said our Lord  "ye have done it unto me"  Matt xxv See the conclusion of my Tract on the Law of Liberty  with their heavenly Master to judge tyrants and oppressors and to call them to account for their want of  brotherly love  The Ethiopians or Negroes received the Christian faith  much sooner  than the Europeans themselves their  early  con∣version was foretold by the Psalmist  Psalm lxviii  Princes shall come out of Egypt  or from  Mizraim  "and Ethiopia"  Wherever we find mention made in the Old Testament of  Ethiopians  though a general name for Negroes yet we shall find them expressed in the Hebrew by the name of the eldest branch of Ham  viz Chus  However we must remember that all Ethiopians are not  Cushites  The prodigious army of a million of  Ethiopians  which was overthrown by Asa were not all descendants of  Chus  though mentioned under the general name of  Chusim  in Chron chap xiv for we read in the th chap th verse that part of that vast body were  Lubims  Were not the  Ethiopians  and  Lubims    "a huge host" said the prophet Hanani when he reminded Asa of his former success The  Lubims  or  Libyans  were a great nation from whom the internal part of Africa receives its name of  Libya  and were de∣scended from Mizraim the second son of Ham who was also the father of the Egyptians  or  Cush    shall soon stretch out her hands unto God  And accordingly we find the  Ethiopian  Eunuch  Who might justly be esteemed  a Prince  of that country being    a Lord  or one  of great authority  under Candace Queen of the Ethiopians  who had the charge of all her Treasure  c  particularly mentioned in Scripture among the first converts to  Christianity and that extraordinary exer∣tion of the HOLY SPIRIT in favour of the eunuch was perhaps the foundation of the ancient Church of Habassi∣nia  The learned Lutholf was of a different opinion and supposed that the Habassinians were not converted till the time of Constantine the Great about the year and though it is not clear whether this latter pe∣riod was the time of their first conversion or not yet certain it is that ever since that time they have maintained the Christian faith and the sacramental in∣stitutions of Christ without yielding to the adultera∣tions of the church of Rome though the same were pressed upon them with all the authority that one of their own Emperors could exert Lutholf has given a full and clear account printed in of those Christian Negroes and their church which seems to be reserved by the providence of God as a  Witness  of the purity of his holy Religion a  Witness  not less remarkable than the church of the Vaudois  which notwithstanding all worldly disadvantages remains in some degree of  purity  to this day as a lasting monument of  Christianity among the sons of Ham  even in the most remote and inaccessible part of Africa  They still retain WaterBaptism and the holy Communion  in both kinds  and drove out the Portuguese Jesuits for attempting by force to pervert and corrupt these  primitive rites  Certain it is say the learned Assembly of Divines that Ethiopia according to this unquestionable prophecy  Psalms lxviii  was one of the first kingdoms that was converted to the Christian faith the occasion and means whereof we read of Acts viii  c  The progress of the truth must have been very rapid in Africa because we read of a council of African and Numi∣dian Bishops held at Carthage so early as the year of Christ    Carthaginense circa annum ccxv sub A∣grippino episcopo Carthaginensi ab  Africae  et  Nu∣midiae  episcopis  de rebaptizandis haereticis habitum  Dr Cave's Hist Literaria p  though our AngloSaxon ancestors remained in the grossest pagan darkness near years afterwards and in the year a council of Bishops was assembled at  Lambesa an  inland city of Africa  on the confines of Biledulgerid against Privatus Bishop of Lambesa on a charge of Heresie  Dr Cave's Hist Literaria p  The fourth Council of Carthage in the year was held by Bishops concerning the Baptism of Infants  Ibid  And in the eighth Council at that place anno be∣sides  "Presentes erant preter Presbyteros Diaconos maximamque plebis partem Episcopi lxxxvii c See Dr Cave's Hist Literaria p also Bohun's Geog Dict p under the word  Lambesa  Priests Deacons and Laymen there were present Bishops In another council of Carthage about the year no less than Bishops of the Sect of the Donatists  Dr Cave's Hist Lit p  were pre∣sent and in the year at Baga an inland City of Africa  Ibid p  Bishops were collected together though the  same was long before the conversion of the English and Dutch the great traders in  African slaves  and though the Africans have since lamentably fallen back into gross ignorance yet we must not on that account look upon them in the same light that the Jews did upon  "the children of the strangers"  whom they were permitted to hold in slavery Levit xxv because we cannot do so without becoming  strangers  ourselves to  Christianity  and hastening  our own apostacy  which seems already too near at hand  The alarming increase of infidelity and the open declarations of Deists Arians Socinians and others who deny the Divinity of Christ and of the Holy Ghost are lamentable proofs of the growing apostacy The African Church fell away by degrees in the same manner till it was totally lost in the most barbarous ignorance except in Habessinia for even those Africans who are free from idolatry and profess to worship  the true God  are nevertheless ensnared and enslaved in the gross errors of  Mahometanism  to which a neglect of the necessary Faith in the  Divinity of Christ  and of the  Holy Ghost  has an apparent tendency We have likewise a remarkable instance of  infidelity  or at least of a total neglect of Scripture authority and re∣velation in the attempt of two late writers to prove that Negroes are  "an inferior species of men"  but the learned Dr  Beattie  in his  Essay on Truth  has fully refuted the insinuations of Mr  Hume  the first broacher of that uncharitable doctrine as well as Aristotle's fu∣tile attempt to justify  slavery  so that Mr  Estwick  's subsequent attempt which was prompted only by the authority of Mr  Hume  needs no further confutation  That I may not be thought a blind admirer of anti∣quity says Dr Beattie I would here crave the read∣er's indulgence for one short digression more in order to put him in mind of an important error in morals inferred from partial and inaccurate experience by no less a person than Aristotle himself He ar∣gues 'That men of little genius and great bodily  strength are by nature destined to serve  and those of  better capacity to command  and that the natives of Greece and of some other countries being natu∣rally superior in genius have  a natural right to  em∣pire and that the rest of mankind being  naturally stupid  are destined to  labour and slavery  ' De Republ lib cap This reasoning is now alas of little advantage  to Aristotle's countrymen who have for many ages been doomed to that slavery  which  in his  judgment  nature had destined them to impose on others  and many nations whom he would have con∣signed  to everlasting stupidity  have shown themselves  equal  in genius to the most  exalted of human kind  It would have been more worthy of Aristotle to have inferred man's natural and universal right to liberty from that natural and universal passion with which men desire it He wanted perhaps to  devise some excuse for servitude  a practice which to  their eternal reproach  both Greeks and Romans tolerated even in the days of their glory  Mr  Hume  argues nearly in the same manner in regard to the superiority of white men over black 'I am apt to suspect' says he 'the negroes and in general all the other species of men for there are four or five different kinds to be naturally inferior to the whites There  never was  a civilized nation of any other complexion than white  nor even any in∣dividual  eminent either in action or speculation  No  ingenious manufactures among them  no  arts  no  sci∣encesThere are negro slaves dispersed all over Europe of which  none  ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity' Hume's Essay on National Charac∣tersThese assertions are strong but I know not whether they have any thing else to recommend them For first though true they would  not prove the point in question  except it were also proved that the Africans and Americans even though arts and sciences were introduced among them would still re∣main unsusceptible of cultivation The  inhabitants of Great Britain and France were as savage two thou∣sand years ago  as those  of Africa and America are at this day  To civilize a nation is a work which it requires long time to accomplish And one may as  well say of an infant that he can never become a man as of a nation now barbarous that it never can be civi∣lized  Secondly of the facts here asserted  no man could have sufficient evidence except from a personal ac∣quaintance with all the negroes that now are or ever were on the face of the earth  Those people write no histories and all the reports of all the travellers that ever visited them will not amount to any thing like a proof of what is here affirmed BUT THIRD∣LY WE KNOW THAT THESE ASSERTIONS ARE NOT TRUE The empires of Peru and Mexico could not have been governed nor the metropolis of the latter built after so singular a manner in the middle of a lake  without men eminent both for action and specula∣tion  Every body has heard of the magnificence good government and ingenuity of the ancient Pe∣ruvians  The Africans and Americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them which even Europeans  would find it no easy matter  to imitate  Sciences indeed they have none because they have no letters but in oratory some of them particularly the Indians  of the Five Nations  are said to be greatly our superiors It will be readily allow∣ed that the condition of a slave is not favourable to genius of any kind and yet  the negro slaves disper∣sed over Europe  have  often discovered symptoms of inge∣nuity notwithstanding their unhappy circumstances  They  become excellent handicraftsmen and practical musicians  and indeed learn every thing their masters are at pains to teach them perfidy and debauchery not excepted That a negro slave who can neither read nor write nor speak any European language who is not permitted to do any thing but what his master commands and who has not a single friend on earth but is universally considered and treated as if he were of a species inferior to the humanthat such a creature should so distinstuish himself among Europeans as to be talked of through the world for a man of genius is surely no reasonable expectation To suppose him of an inferior species because he does not thus distinguish himself is just as rational as to suppose any private European of an inferior species because he has not raised himself to the condition of royalty  Had the Europeans been destitute of the arts of writing and working in iron they might have re∣mained to this day as barbarous as the natives of Africa and America Nor is the invention of these arts to be ascribed to our superior capacity The ge∣nius of the inventor is not always to be estimated ac∣cording to the importance of the invention Gun∣powder and the mariner's compass have produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs and yet were accidental discoveries Such probably were the first essays in writing and working in iron Suppose them the effects of contrivance they were at least contrived by a few individuals and if they required a superiority of understanding or of species in the in∣ventors those inventors and their descendents are the only persons who can lay claim to the honour of that superiority  That every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not according to the usages of modern Eu∣rope seems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philosophers Their remarks often put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion If negroes and Indians were disposed to recriminate if a Lucian or a Voltaire from the coast of Guinea or from  the Five Nations  were to pay us a visit what a picture of European manners might he present to his countrymen at his return Nor would carica∣tura or exaggeration be necessary to render it hi∣deous  A plain historical account of some of our most fashionable duellists gamblers and adulterers  to name no more would exhibit  specimens of brutish barbarity and sottish infatuation  such as might vie with any that ever appeared in Kamschatka California or the land of Hottentots  It is easy to see with what views some modern au∣thors throw out these hints to prove the natural inferiori∣ty  of negroes But let every friend to  humanity pray that they may be disappointed  Britons are famous for generosity a virtue in which it is easy for them to excel both the Romans and the Greeks  Let it never be said that slavery  is countenanced by the bravest and most generous people on earth by a people who are animated with that heroic passion the love of liberty beyond all nations ancient or modern and the fame of whose toilsome but unwearied perse∣verance  in vindicating at the expence of life and fortune the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror into the hearts of sycophants and tyrants  and excite the admiration and gratitude of all good men to the latest posterity  Essay on Truth P and  We may la∣ment  the fallen state of our unhappy brethren but we have  no commission  under the Gospel  to punish them for it as the Israelites had to punish the  Heathens  that were condemned in the law Our endeavour should be rather  to restore the  Heathens  to their lost privileges than to harden them in  their prejudices by tolerating amongst us a greater degree of  despotism  and  op∣pression  than was  ever permitted among the Jews  or even among the ancient  Heathens  for in one of our own  anti∣christian  colonies even the  murder  of a negro slave when under  private  punishment  is tolerated  see the

tendency of tolerating slavery in England Lon∣don  p and Many instances of WestIndia cruelty have fallen even within my own knowledge and I have certain proofs of no less than three married women

made  them  at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wise and they twain shall be  one flesh  Wherefore they are  no more twain  but  one flesh  What there∣fore GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER  Matth xix and  even in London by the order of their pretended proprietors Another re∣markable instance

was further distinguished in the advertizement by having  round his neck a brass collar  with a direction upon it to a house in Charlottestreet Bloomsburysquare  Thus the  black Indian Pompey  was manifestly treated with as little ceremony as a  black name∣sake of the dog kind  could be I inquired after the author of this unlawful and shameful advertizement and found that he was a merchant even in the heart of the city of London who shall be nameless for I do not want to expose  individuals  but only their  crimes  Now if masters are capable of such monstrous OPPRESSION  even here in England  where their brutality renders  them liable to severe penalties how can we reasonably reject the accounts of TYRANNY  in America  howsoever hor∣rid and inhuman where the abominable plantation laws will permit a capricious or passionate master with impunity to deprive his wretched slave even of life  I am frequently told nevertheless by interested persons from the WestIndies how well the slaves are used and that they are much happier than  our own poor at home  But though I am willing to believe that  some sew  worthy WestIndians treat their slaves with humani∣ty yet it is certainly far from being  the general case  and the misery of our  own poor  will not be any excuse for  the oppression of the poor  elsewhere When any of our own countrymen  at home  are miserably  poor  it is not always clear whether themselves or others are to  be blamed all we can know for cer∣tain is that it is the indispensable duty of  every man  to  relieve them  according to his ability and that the neglecting an opportunity of doing so is as great an offence before God as if we had denied assistance to  Christ himself  in the same wretched condition sor so it is expressly laid down in Scripture    Then shall the king say unto them on his right handCome ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world For I was an hungred and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a  stranger  and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came unto me Then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed  thee  or thirsty and gave  thee  drink When saw we thee a  stranger  and took  thee  in or naked and clothed  thee  Or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee And the king shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done  it  unto one of the least of these my bre∣thren ye have done  it  unto me Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand Depart from me  ye cursed into everlasting fire  prepared for the devil and his angels For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink I was a  stranger  and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not Then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee an hungred or a thirst or a  stranger  or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee Then shall he answer them say∣ing Verily I say unto you  inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me  And these shall go away into  ever lasting punishment  but the righteous into  life eternal  Matth xxv  through the mercy of God towards  the poor  but it is obvious to whom the misery of  a slave  is to be attributed for  the guilty possessor  will certainly be answerable to God for it and every man who endeavours to palliate and screen such  oppression  is undoubtedly  a partaker of the guilt  The  slave∣holder  deceives himself if he thinks he can really  be a  CHRISTIAN  and yet  hold such property  Can he be said  to love his neighbour as himself  I have examined this point more at large in a tract on  "The Law of Liberty"  which is intended also for publication  Does he behave to others as he would they should to him  Ye have heard that it hath been said  Thou shalt love thy neighbour  and hate thine enemy  but I say unto you  said our Lord himself  love your enemies  c That ye may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven for he maketh his sun to rise  on the evil  and on the good and sendeth rain  on the just and on the unjust  Matth v so that  Heathens  are by no means excluded from the benevolence  of Christians  Thus Christ has enlarged the antient Jewish doctrine of  loving our neighbours  as ourselves  and has also taught us by the parable of the good Samaritan that  all mankind  even our  professed ene∣mies  such as were the Samaritans to the Jews must necessarily be esteemed our  neighbours  whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance so that the  same benevolence  which was due from the  Jew to his brethren of the house of Israel  is indispensably due  under the Gospel  to OUR BRETHREN OF THE UNIVERSE howsoever opposite in religi∣ous or political opinions for this is the apparent intention of the parable  No nation therefore whatever can now be lawfully excluded as  strangers  according to that uncharitable sense of the word  stranger  in which the Jews were apt to distinguish all other nations from themselves and since  all men  are now to be esteemed  brethren and  neighbours  under the Gospel none of the Levitical laws relating to the bon∣dage of  strangers  are in the least appli∣cable to justify slavery  among Christians  though the same laws bind  Christians  as well as  Jews  with respect to all the les∣sons of  benevolence  to  strangers  which are every where interspersed therein be∣cause these are  moral doctrines  which never change for they perfectly corre∣spond with  "the everlasting Gospel"  Rev xiv As for instance  Thou shalt  not oppress a Stranger  for ye know the heart of a  Stranger  seeing ye were  strangers  in the land of Egypt  Exod xxiii This is an appeal to the  feelings  and ex∣perience of the Jews who had them∣selves endured a  heavy bondage  so that it clearly corresponds with the  "royal law" or "law of liberty"  in the Gospel  "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"  Gal v or as our Lord himself has more fully expressed it  All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for  THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PRO∣PHETS  Matth vii  Again  If a  stranger  sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not vex or oppress him  but  the  stranger  that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou SHALT LOVE HIM "viz  the stranger  " AS THYSELF for  ye were  STRANGERS in the land of Egypt  I am the Lord your God  Levit xix Let every slaveholder consider the importance of this command and the unchangeable dignity of him who gave it "I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD"for  the LORD YOUR GOD is  God  of  Gods  and  Lord  of  Lords  a  great  God a  migh∣ty  and a  terrible  which regardeth not persons  not the Masters more than any slaves  nor taketh reward He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and LOVETH THE STRAN∣GER in giving him food and raiment LOVE YE  therefore the stranger  for ye were  strangers  in the land of Egypt  Deut x And how can a man be said to  love  the  stranger  and much less to  love him as himself  see the express command above who presumes to vex and oppress him with a per∣petual involuntary bondage Is this obedience to that great rule of the Gos∣pel which Christ has given us as the  sum of the law and the prophets  Would the American slaveholders relish that con∣temptuous and cruel usage with which they oppress their poor negroes and  that the  African  The prosent deplorable slate of the  African strangers in general  ought to warn us of similar ju  g∣ments against the inhabitants of th  se kingdoms My own Grandfather  near a century ago  wanting only three years viz in  warned our great national counsel of God's vengeance  by this very example  That  AFRICA says h  which is not now more fruitful of monsters than it was once of excellent∣ly wise and learned men that AFRICA which for∣merly afforded us our Clemens our Origen our Ter∣tu  ian our Cyprian our Augustine and many other extraordinary lights in the church of God that FA∣MOUS AFRICA  in whose soil Christianity did thrive so prodigiously and could boast of so many jourishing churches alas is now a wilderness The wild boars have broken into the vineyard and eaten it up and it brings forth nothing but briars and thorns  to use the words of the prophet And  who knows but  GOD  may suddenly make  THIS CHURCH AND NATION THIS OUR ENGLAND which Jeshurun like is  waxed fat and grown proud  and  has kicked against God  SUCH ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE VENGEANCE OF THIS KIND  See arch bp Sharp's Sermons second vol st Serm which was preached before the house of Commons April Page  strangers  should do even so to themselves without the least personal provocation or fault on their part  viz to be branded with a hot iron in or∣der to be known and ranked as the cattle and private property of their oppressors Like the cattle also to be ignominously compelled by the whip of a driver to la∣bour hard  "without wages"  or recom∣pence If the African merchants and American slaveholders can demonstrate that they would not think themselves in∣jured by such treatment from others they may perhaps be free from the horrid guilt of  unchristian oppression  and  uncharitable∣ness  which must otherwise inevitably be imputed to them because their actions will not bear the test of that excellent rule of the Gospel abovementioned which Christ has laid down as the measure of our actions  All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets  Math vii I must there∣fore  once more repeat what I have be∣fore advanced that the permission for∣merly granted to the Jews of holding  heathens and strangers  in slavery is vir∣tually repealed or rather superseded by the Gospel notwithstanding the contrary assertion of the African merchant that Christ  "did not repeal that of slaves"  The  African merchant  has also re∣published the letters of his fellow ad∣vocate  Mercator  who professes in the same manner to draw his authority  "from Sacred history"    To the sedate to the reasonable to the Christian read∣ers says he I shall more fully set forth the  lawfulness of the slave trade  from the express allowance of it in Holy writ  ibid appendix B iv but the very first insinuation concerning the origin of slave  y which follows this specious address to the sedate c is founded on TWO  false assertions  even in  ONE sentence and therefore I can∣not esteem him worthy of any further notice than that of pointing out these proofs of his little regard to truth  As to its origin says he it may possibly be derived from that sentence expressed against Canaan  from whom the Africans  says he  are descended  by his father No∣ah at the hour of his death  It was not  "at the honr of his death"  but  when he awoke from his wine  after he had tasted too freely the fruits of the vineyard which he planted when he began to be a husbandman the time therefore was probably very soon after the flood and not  at the hour of his death  as misrepresented by Mercator for he lived after the flood years Genests ix  Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren  But though the author afterwards allows that  both the origin of slavery and the colour of the Africans are incapable of  positive proof  yet the futility of his insinuation concerning the  descent of the Africans  is not like the other two circumstances  incapable of positive proof  For the  Africans  are not  descended from Canaan  if we ex∣cept the Carthaginians a colony from the sea coast of  the land of Canaan  who were a free people and at one time ri∣valled even the Roman common wealth in power The  Africans  are principally descended from the three other sons of  Ham  viz  Cush Misraim  and  Phut  and to prove this more at large I have sub∣joined to this tract a letter which I re∣ceived in answer to mine on the same subject from a learned gentleman who has most carefully studied the antiquities of the line of  Ham  the insinuation there∣fore concerning the  sentence expressed against Canaan  can by no means justify the  African slave trade  so that  Mercator  seems indeed to write like a  mere trader  for the sake of his iniquitous  Traffic  more than for the sake of  truth  not∣withstanding his professions of regard for the Holy Scriptures  If we carefully examine the Scrip∣tures we shall find that slavery and op∣pression were ever abominable in the sight of God for though the Jews were permitted by the law of Moses on ac∣count of the  hardness of their hearts  to keep slaves as I have remarked in my answer to the  Reverend Mr Thompson  on this subject which is subjoined yet there was no inherent right of service to be implied from this permission be∣cause whenever the flave could escape he was esteemed  free  and it was  ab∣solutely unlawful  for any man who be∣lieved the word of God  to deliver him up again to his master  see Deut xxiii whereas in our co∣lonies which in acts of OPPRESSION  may too justly be esteemed  antichristian  the slave who  runs away  is  deemed rebellious  and a reward of £ is offered to those who SHALL KILL  or "bring in alive any rebellious slave"  see the th act of the laws of Jamaica By an act of Virginia Ann ch § P after proclamation is issued against slaves that  run away and lie out  it is  LAWFUL for  any person whatfoever to  KILL  and  DESTROY SUCH SLAVES  by such ways and means as he she or they  SHALL THINK FIT  without accusation or impeach∣ment of any crime for the same  c See the remarks on these and such other  diabolical acts  of plantation assem∣blies in pages to of my re∣presentation of the injustice and dan∣gerous tendency of tolerating slavery in England Printed in  By another act of Virginia  Geo chap § P if a poor fellow is taken up as  a runaway  and committed to prison the goaler may let him out to hire in order to pay the fees even though he is not claimed  and his master or owner  says the act  cannot be known  and in a following clause the goaler is ordered to  cause a strong  IRON COLLAR TO BE PUT ON THE NECK  of such negroe or runaway with the letters  P G  stamped thereon  a most abominable affront to human na∣ture our spiritual enemy must have had a notorious influence with the plantation law makers to procure an act so contradictory to the laws of God  Even white servants  English Scotch and Irish  are frequently taken up by the  sheriff  and  goalers  without any warrant or previous judgment what∣ever merely "on  suspicion of being servants  " and they are then  advertized  to be  delivered up  to their ty∣rannical masters but though there is great injustice and oppression in taking up these poor people merely "on suspicion  of being servants  " yet it does not appear to be so flagrant a breach of God's command before∣mentioned as the delivering up the poor runaway  ne∣groes  who are foreigners and strangers and consequently less capable of obtaining redress when they are really injured the white servants are generally understood to be bound to their masters only for a short limited time either with their own consent by private contract or as felons who are banished their mother country after a fair trial  by jury  which excludes any suspicion of injustice and are sold for a certain term to pay the expences of their passage c whereby the right of ser∣vice claimed from them by the master is more in the nature of a  pecuniary debt  than of absolute slavery so that the white runaway servant may perhaps  as a debtor  be delivered up to his master without any direct breach of the law of God beforementioned provided there is no apprehension or probability of his being treated with cruelty on his return or that the master would be li∣able to exact more service than is due in which case the law ought to afford protection and redress but no pretences of this kind can justify the  delivering up  a a negroe  stranger  The poor negroes are claimed  for life  as an  absolute property  though to compare their case with white servants they never offended any member of our community either at home or abroad to justify such a severe punishment under  British Govern∣ment  neither are they capable of entering into such a  legal contract  for service as might justify a master's claim to it being absolutely incapacitated by  unlawful duress  to  enter into any contract  as long as they are de∣tained by force or fear in the  British dominions  for which  injustice  to  strangers  the  British dominions  must sooner or later receive a severe  retribution  and there∣fore  the delivering up to his master a negroe servant  "THAT HAS ESCAPED FROM HIS MASTER" and has since regained his natural liberty must necessarily be esteemed a shameful and notorious breach of God's law  Nevertheless our publick prints inform us even of an English man of war  and another vessel being lately sent from Grenada to the Spanish main  to claim some slaves that had made their escape from the Islands  see Gazetteer June the writer of the pa∣ragraph also expresses great disappointment on ac∣count of the issue of this unwarrantable and disgraceful embassy  instead of meeting with that justice and civility which  sa  he  they had a right to expect the Governors at both places we are told treated them with the greatest haughtiness and contempt and refused to give them the smallest satisfaction  but alas the  very ex∣pectation  of better treatment upon an errand so unlaw∣ful in itself and so disgraceful to his Majesty's naval service is a proof of the most deplorable degeneracy and ignorance Even the cruel Spaniards are more civilized and shew more mercy to their slaves at present than the English of which their new regulations for the abolishing of slavery afford ample proof though the RETRIBUTION for their former Tyranny has lately fal∣len heavily on them according to the last accounts from  Chiloe  and  Chili  which ought to be considered as mer∣ciful warnings to the rest of the world against tyranny and slavery  and in particular to that last cited from Deutrenomy viz  Thou shalt  not deliver unto his master the ser∣vant which is escaped from his master  unto thee He shall dwell with thee among you in that place which he shall choose  that is manifestly as a free man  in one of thy gates  where it liketh him best thou shalt not  oppress him  Deut xxiii This is clearly a  moral law  which must be ever binding as the will of  God  because the benevolent  intention  of it is  apparent  and must ever remain the same for  which reason I conclude that AN AC∣TION of TROVER  cannot lye for a slave  and that no man can lawfully be prose∣cuted for protecting a negroe or any other slave whatever that has  escaped from his master  because that would be punishing a man for doing  his in∣dispensable duty  according  to the laws of God  and if any law custom or prece∣dent should be alledged to the contrary it must necessarily be rejected as  null and void  because it is a maxim of the com∣mon law of England that  the inferior law must give place to the superior man's laws to God's laws  attorney general Noy's maxims P And the learned author of the  Doctor  and  Stu∣dent  asserts that even  Statute law  ought to be accounted  null and void  if  it is set forth contrary to the laws of God  ETIAM SI ALIQUOD STATUTUM ESSE EDITUM CONTRA EOS NUL∣LIUS  VIGORIS  in legibus Angliae cense∣ri debet c  chap vi  The degree of servitude which the Israelites were permitted to exact of  their brethren  was mild and equitable when compared with the servitude which to our confusion be it said is common among Christians I have al∣ready quoted from Leviticus a specimen of the limitation to the servitude of BRETHREN but the Jews were not only restrained  from oppressing their  BRETHREN but were also bound by the law  to assist them generously and bounti∣fully  according to every man's ability when they dismissed them from their service which is a duty too seldom practiced among Christians see Deut∣renomy xv  If thy brother an Hebrew man or an Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years  then in the  SEVENTH YEAR  thou shalt let him  GO FREE  from thee  See also Exodus xxi  And when thou sendest him out  FREE  from thee thou shalt  NOT LET HIM GO AWAY EMPTY  Thou shalt furnish him  LIBERALLY  out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy wine press  of that  wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him And thou shalt remember that  THOU WAST A BONDMAN  in the land of E∣gypt  AND THE LORD THY GOD RE∣DEEMED THEE THEREFORE  I com∣mand thee this thing to day  These are the very utmost  limits of servitude  that we might venture to exact of our bre∣thren  even if we were Jews  and how much more are we bound to observe every thing that is merciful in the law whilst we pro∣fess  Christianity  What then must we think of ourselves if we compare these Jewish  limitations with our Plantation laws  A bountiful recompence  for the service is  plainly enjoined  whereas the whole sub∣stance perhaps of the most wealthy  English  or  Scotch  slaveholders would not suffice to pay  what is due in strict justice  to those who have  laboured in his service  if the reward is to be proportioned to their sufferings but it shall one day be required of them  Your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall  EAT YOUR FLESH AS IT WERE FIRE  Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days  BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABOURERS  which have rea∣ped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud  CRIETH  and  THE CRIES  of them  WHICH HAVE REAPED  are eutered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth    or of  ARMIES James v and  The  slaveholder  perhaps will say that this text is not applicable to him since he cannot be said to have  kept back by fraud  the hire of his labourers  because he never made any agreement with them for  wages  having bought their  bodies  of the  slave dealer  and thereby made them his  own private property  so that he has  a right  he will say  to all their labour without wages  But this is a vain ex∣cuse for his  oppression  because it is not so much  the previous agreement  as the LA∣BOUR which renders  wages due  for  THE LABOURER  is worthy of  HIS HIRE  Luke x and the sin which  CRIETH  in the ears of the Lord of Sa∣baoth  is the  using  a poor man's LABOUR "WITHOUT WAGES" so that whether there is an  agreement for wages  or  no a∣greement  yet if THE LABOUR  is perfor∣med  the  wages are due  and those who keep them back may be said to  build their house in unrighteousness  as the prophet  Jeremiah has declared in the strongest terms Jer xxii  Wo unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteous∣ness and his chambers by wrong that  USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK  And the holy Job even before the law declared his detestation of UNRE∣WARDED SERVICE  If my land  said he  cry against me or that the furrows like∣wise thereof complain  IF I HAVE EAT∣EN THE FRUITS THEREOF WITHOUT MONEY  or have caused the owners there∣of to lose there life  Which was too much the case in the late English acquisition of  "the fine cream part of the Island"  of St Vincent'sSee authentic papers relative to the expedition against the Charibbs Page  let thistles  grow instead of wheat and cockle in∣stead of barley  Job xxxi  The wise son of Sirach has also add∣ed his testimony to the same doctrine  He that defraudeth the  LABOURER  of his hire is a bloodsheder  Ecclesiasticus xxxiv The slaveholder will per∣haps endeavour to evade these texts also by alledging that though indeed he  useth his neighbour's service  WITHOUT WAGES yet he cannot be said to  give him nothing for his work  because he is at the expence of providing him with food and cloathing  Osnabrug trowsers and sometimes also a Cap  and there∣fore this severe text is not applicable to him But let such a one remember if he calls himself a  Christian  that  Chris∣tian  masters are absolutely bound to have some regard to  the interest  of their ser∣vants as well as to their own  interest  Masters give unto your  SERVANTS  that which is  JUST AND EQUAL  know∣ing that  YE ALSO  have  a MASTER  in heaven  Colloss iv  But  slaveholders  in general have no idea of what is "JUST AND EQUAL" to be given  to servants  according to the Scriptures  It is not a mere support in food and necessaries as a master feeds his horse or his ass to enable the creature to perform his labour but as  man  is superior to  brutes  a further reward is  "just and equal"  to be given to the human  servant  I have already sufficiently proved that  every man  under the Gospel is to be considered as our  neighbour  AND  brother  and conse∣quently whatever was  "just and equal"  "to be given by a Jew to his neighbour or  Hebrew brother  under the Old Testa∣ment  the same must necessarily be considered as  "just and equal"  and  abso∣lutely due  from  Christians  to men of  all nations  without distinction whom we are bound to treat  as brethren  under the Gospel  in whatever capacity they serve us  Let the American  slaveholder  therefore remember that  even according to the Jewish law  if he argues upon it  as a  CHRISTIAN  ought to do  he is absolute∣ly indebted to each of his slaves  for every days labour  BEYOND  the first six years  OF HIS SERVITUDE  In the  SEVENTH  year  said the Lord by Moses  thou shalt let him  GO FREE  from thee And when thou sendest him out  FREE  from thee thou  SHALT NOT LET HIM GO AWAY EMPTY  Thou shalt furnish him  LI∣BERALLY  out of thy  FLOCK c  wherewith the Lord thy God hath bless∣ed thee thou shalt give unto him  c  If this was the indispensable duty  even of Jews  how much more is it "JUST AND EQUAL to be observed by  Christian  The same command when applied to the  American planter  will in∣clude a proper stock of plants for cul∣tivation as SugarCanes Tobacco In∣digo c as well as cattle and stores to enable a poor man to maintain him∣self and family upon a small farm or lot of spare ground lett for a certain li∣mited time on reasonable terms and renewable on equitable conditions which are the only true means of re∣ducing  the price of labour  and  provisions  Let not the planter  grudge  to part with his  servant  when he has  served  a reason∣able time in proportion to  his price  agreeable for instance to the regula∣tions adopted by the  Spaniards  which I have already recommended to the  English  planters See Appendix for the word of God forbids any such base reluctance  It shall not  SEEM HARD UNTO THEE  when thou sendest  HIM AWAY FREE  from thee for he hath been worth a double hired ser∣vant  to thee  in serving thee six years and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest  Deut xv  The slaveholder perhaps will alledge that though the Jews were bound to shew this benevolence to their  brethren of Israel  yet the same laws do not bind the American planter because his slaves are for the most part  heathens  or as some of the negroes are  Mahometans  and therefore he is not bound to consider them as his  brethren  being rather justi∣fied by the law which permitted the Jews to keep  heathen slaves  and  the children of the strangers  in perpetual bondage c They shall be your  bondmen for ever  see Leviticus xxv and But I have already guarded against  this objection in the former part of this tract and it must clearly appear by the several points since mentioned that  as Christians  we must not presume to look upon any man whatever in the same light that the  Israelites  once did upon  "the children of the strangers"  whether they be  black  or  white Hea∣thens  or  Mahometans  If a  Heathen  or a  Mahometan  happens to fall into our hands shall we confirm his prejudices by  oppression  instead of endeavouring to instruct him as a  bro∣ther  Surely the blood of such a poor infidel must rest on the guilty head of that  nominal  Christian who neglects the opportunity of adding to the num∣ber of  his brethren  in the Faith And therefore let that man who endeavours to deprive others of their just privileges as  brethren  take heed lest he should there∣by unhappily occasion his  own rejection  in the end when that dreadful doom which the uncharitable must expect will certainly be pronouncedFor then "  the  KING" the King of King's  shall answer and say unto them Verily I say unto youIn as much as ye have done  it  unto one  of  the least of these  MY BRETHREN  for that glorious KING will esteem even the meanest SLAVES as HIS BRETHREN if they believe

PREFACE"  by a Gentleman of the Law in West Jersey  "containing the Sen∣timents of the Monthly Reviewers on a Tract by the Rev T Thompson  in Favour  of the  Slave Trade  "  The Lord also will be a Refuge for the Oppressed a Refuge in Time of Trouble  Psalm ix  BURLINGTON  WEST JERSEY Printed MDCCLXXIII  LONDON  reprinted  Preface by the American Editor  THE following Essay though wrote as the Author signifies in haste is thought to have such merit as to deserve a publicationThe copy was sent to one of the Writer's particular friends whether for his own peculiar sa∣tisfaction or the press is uncertain but as the subject is  Liberty  so it is expected the  Freedom  which is here taken cannot justly give him offence or be unaccepta∣ble to the public  IT was designed to confute a piece wrote by Thomas Thompson M A some time fellow of C C C entitled  The Afri∣can trade for Negro Slaves shewn to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion  'Printed at Canterbury'  IN order to shew that the Essay Writer has not misrepresented the text nor is single in his observations upon it the sen∣timents of the Monthly Reviewers on that pamphlet in May are here insert∣ed  "We must acknowledge" say they  that the branch of trade here under considera∣tion  is a species of traffic which we have never been able to reconcile with the dic∣tates of humanity and much less with those of religion The principal argu∣ment in its behalf seems to be the  neces∣sity  of such a rescource in order to carry on the works in our plantations which we are told it is otherwise impossible to perform But this though the urgency of the case may be very great is not by any means sufficient to justify the prac∣tice There is a farther consideration which has a plausible appearance and may be thought to carry some weight it is that the merchant only purchases those who were slaves before and possi∣bly may rather than otherwise render their lituation more tolerable But it is well known that the lot of our Slaves when most favourably considered is very hard and miserable besides which such a trade is taking the advantage of the ig∣norance and brutality of unenlightened na∣tions who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpose and it is to be feared are sometimes tempted to seize those of their own tribes or families that they may obtain the hoped for ad∣vantage and it is owned with regard to our merchants that upon occasion they observe the like practices which are  thought to be allowable because they are done by way of reprisal for theft or damage committed by the natives We were pleased however to meet with a pamphlet on the other side of the ques∣tion and we entered upon its perusal with the hopes of finding somewhat ad∣vanced which might afford us satisfaction on this difficult point The writer ap∣pears to be a sensible man and capable of discussing the argument but the li∣mits to which he is confined rendered his performance rather superficial The plea he produces from the Jewish law is not in our view of the matter at all conclusive The people of Israel were under a  theocracy  in which the Supreme Being was in a peculiar sense their King and might therefore issue forth some or∣ders for them which it would not be warrantable for another people who were in different circumstances to observe Such for instance was the command given concerning the extirpation of the Canaanites whom the sovereign Arbiter of life and death might if he had pleased have destroyed by plague or famine or other of those means which we term na∣tural causes and by which a wise Provi∣dence fulfils its own purposes But it would be unreasonable to infer from the  manner in which the Israelites dealt with the people of Canaan that any other na∣tions have a right to pursue the same me∣thod Neither can we imagine that St Paul's exhortation to servants or slaves upon their conversion to continue in the state in which christianity found them affords any argument favourable to the practice here pleaded for It is no more than saying that Christianity did not particularly enter into the regulations of civil society at that time that it taught persons to be contented and diligent in their stations but certainly it did not forbid them in a proper and lawful way if it was in their power to render their circumstances more comfortable Upon the whole we must own that this little treatise is not convincing to us though as different persons are differently affected by the same considerations it may prove more satisfactory to others  'IN another place they observe'  since we are  all brethren  and God has given to  all  men a natural right to  Liberty  we al∣low of no  Slavery  among us unless a per∣son forfeits his freedom by his crimes  THAT Slavery is not consistent with the English constitution nor admissable in Great Britain appears evidently by the late solemn determination in the court of

clearness be proved to have descended from any of those nations who so came under the Di∣vine displeasure as to be brought into ser∣vitude if they are and those denuncia∣tions given in the Old

any  MANY who admit the indefensibility of Slavery considering the subject rather too superficially declare it would be im∣politic to emancipate those we are possessed of and say they generally behave ill when set at liberty I believe very few of the advocates for freedom think that all ought to be manumitted nay think it would be unjust to turn out those who  have spent their prime of life and now require a support but many are in a fit capacity to do for themselves and the public as to these let every master or mistress do their duty and leave conse∣quences to the Disposer of events who I believe will always bless our actions in proportion to the purity of their spring But many instances might be given of Negroes and Mulatoes once in Slavery who after they have obtained their li∣berty and sometimes even in a state of bondage have given striking proofs of their integrity ingenuity industry ten∣derness and nobility of mind of which if the limits of this little Piece permit∣ed I could mention many examples and why instances of this kind are not more fre∣quent we may very naturally impute to the smallness of the number tried with freedom and the servility and meanness of their

duty to investigate the way of  truth and justice with our utmost ability  A much more extensive and perfect view of the subject under consideration has of late prevailed than formerly and he be∣lieves nothing is wanting but an impartial disinterested attention to make still greater advances Thus by a gradual progression he hopes the name of  Slavery  will be eradi∣cated by the general voice of mankind in this land of  Liberty  THE mode of manumitting negroes in NewJersey is such as appears terrific and amounts almost to a prohibition because of its incumbering consequences which

compleat discharge In Mariland where Negroes are so numerous I am informed the master or mistress may at pleasure give Liberty to their slaves without the least obligation and be clear of any future burden Both these are exceptionable and may be improved Proper distinctions are necessary for as the freedom of all gratis might be unjust not only to the publick but the Slave so any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labour of the  individual would be unreasonable The wisdom of a legislature earnestly disposed to do good will I hope be directed to sur∣mount every little difficulty in pointing out a scheme more equal and perfect by steering a middle course and proper care being kindly taken to assist and provide for the usefulness of those deserving objects of benevolence the approbation of Divine Providence will I doubt not attend such laudable endeavours and crown them with successThat the legislative body

Guardians of Liberty  is the sincere wish of  THE EDITOR  AN ESSAY on SLAVERY Proving from Scripture its inconsisten∣cy with Humanity and Religion  By  GRANVILLE SHARP  A REVEREND author Mr Tho∣mas Thompson M A has late∣ly attempted to prove  that the Afri∣can trade for Negroe Slaves is con∣sistent with the principles of  humanity  and  revealed religion  FROM Leviticus xxv to he draws his principle conclusion viz  that the buying and selling of Slaves  is not con∣trary to the law of nature  for says  he the  Jewish constitutions  were strictly therewith consistent  in all points  and these are in certain cases the rule by which is determined by  learned lawyers  and casuists what is or is not  contrary to nature  I have not leisure to follow this author me∣thodically but will nevertheless ex∣amine his ground  in a general way  in order to prevent any ill use that may be made of it against the important question now depending before the judges  a  Meaning I suppose says the American editor the case of Somerset which then depended  THE reverend Mr Thompson's  pre∣mises are not true  for the Jewish con∣stitutions  were not "strictly consistent"  with the  law of nature  in all points as he supposes and consequently his prin∣cipal  conclusion  thereupon is erroneous Many things were formerly tolerated among the Israelites merely through  the mercy and forbearance of God in consideration of their extreme frailty and inability at that time to bear a more perfect system of law Other laws there are in the five books besides the ceremonial laws now abrogated which are merely  municipal  being adapted to the peculiar polity of the Israelitish com∣monwealth on account of its situation in the midst of the most barbarous na∣tions whom the Hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to immi∣tate  THE universal  moral laws  and those of  natural equity  are indeed every where plentifully interspersed among the  peculiar laws  abovementioned but they may very easily be distinguished by every sincere Christian who examines them with  a liberal mind  because the  benevolent purpose  of the Divine Author  is  always apparent  in those laws which are to be  eternally binding  for  it is  the reason  of the law which consti∣tutes the  life of the law  according to an allowed maxim of our own country "Ratio Legis est anima Legis" Jenk Cent And with respect to these  moral  and  equitable  laws I will readily agree with the Reverend Mr Thomp∣son that they are the best rule by which  learned judges and casuists can deter∣mine what is or is not  contrary to nature  BUT I will now give a few examples of laws which are in  themselves contra∣ry to nature or natural equity  in order to shew that Mr Thompson's  premises  are totally false  THE Israelites were expressly  permitted by the law of Moses  to give a bill of di∣vorce  to their wives whenever they pleased and to marry  other women  and the women who were put away were also expressly permitted by the Mosaic law  to marry again  during the lives of their for mer husbands  ALL which practices were manifest∣ly contrary to  the law of nature  in its purity though not perhaps to  the nature of our corrupt affections and desires  for Christ himself declared that  from the beginning it was not so  Matt xix and at the same time our Lord infor∣med the Jews that  Moses because of  the hardness of their hearts  suffered them to put away their wives  NEITHER was it  according to the law of nature  that the Jews were  permitted  in their behaviour and dealings to make a partial distinction between their  brethren  of the house of Israel and strangers This national partiality was not indeed either commanded or re∣commended in their lawbut it was clearly  permitted  or  tolerated  and pro∣bably for the same reason as the last mentioned instance  thou  shalt not lend  upon usury to  thy brother  c  unto  a stranger  thou mayest  lend upon usury  c Deut xxiii Again of  a foreigner  thou  mayest exact  that is whatsoever  has been lent  as ap∣pears by the preceding verses but that which is  thine  with thy brother  thine hand shall release  Deut xv  Now all these laws were  "contrary to the law of nature"  or  "natural equi∣ty"  whatever Mr Thompson may think and were certainly annulled or rather  superseded  as it were by the more perfect doctrines of  universal be∣nevolence  taught by Christ himself who  "come not to destroy but to fulfill the law"  IN the law of Moses we also read  Thou shalt not avenge or bear grudge against  the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy∣self  Leviticus xix  THE Jews accordingly thought themselves sufficiently justified if they confined this glorious perfection of cha∣rity viz  the loving others as themselves  to the persons mentioned in the same verse viz  the children of their own people  for they had no idea that so much love could possibly be due to any other sort of  neighbours  or  brethren  But Christ taught them by the parable of  the good Samaritan  that  all strangers whatever  even those who are declared enemies as were the Samaritans to the Jews are to be esteemed our  neigh∣bours  or  brethren  whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance  "THE Jewish institution" indeed as Mr Thompson remarks  permited the use of  bondservants  but did not per∣mit the  bondage of brethren  STRAN∣GERS ONLY could be  lawfully  retain∣ed as  bondmen  "of the heathen" or more agreeable to the Hebrew words  of the nations    that are round about you of  them  shall ye buy  bond  men and  bond  maids More∣over of the children of  strangers  that do sojourn among you  of them shall ye buy  c  They  shall be your  bondmen for ever  Levit xxv to  THIS was the law I must acknow∣ledge with respect to  a stranger  that was  purchased  but with respect to  a brother  or Hebrew of the seed of Abraham it was far otherwise as the same chapter testifies th verse for  if thy  bro∣ther  that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be  sold  unto thee thou  shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant  but as an hired servant and as a so∣journer he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of ju∣bilee And  then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him  c This was the  utmost servitude  that a Hebrew could  lawfully  exact from a∣ny of his  brethren  of the house of Israel unless the servant entered  voluntarily  into a perpetual servitude and let me add that it is also the very  utmost servitude  that can  lawfully  be admitted  among christians  because we are bound as christians to esteem EVERY MAN  as our brother  and  as our neighbour  which I have already proved so that this consequence  which I have drawn is absolutely  un∣avoidable  The Jews indeed who do not yet acknowlege the commands of Christ may perhaps still think them∣selves  justified  by the law of Moses in making partial distinctions between  their brethren  of Israel  and other men  but it would  be inexcusable  in christians to do so and therefore I conclude that we certainly have no right to exceed the  limits of servitude  which the Jews were bound to observe whenever their poor  brethren  were sold to them and I ap∣prehend that we must not venture  even to go so far  because the laws of  brother∣ly love  are infinitely enlarged and ex∣tended by the gospel of peace which proclaims  "good will towards men"  without distinction and because we cannot be said to  love our neighbours as ourselves  or to  do to others as we would they should do unto us  "whilst we  retain them against their  will  in a des∣picable servitude as  slaves  and  private property  or  mere chattels  THE glorious system of the gospel destroys all  narrow national partiality  and makes  us citizens of the world  by obliging us to profess  universal benevo∣lence  but more especially are we bound as christians to commiserate and assist to the utmost of our power all persons in  distress  or  captivity  whatever  the  worshipful  committee of the compa∣ny of merchants trading to  Africa  may think of it or their advocate the reverend Mr Thompson  CHARITY indeed begins at home and we ought most certainly to give the preference to our own countrymen whenever we can do so without injus∣tice but we may  not do evil that  good may come  though our states∣men and their political deceivers may think otherwise we must not for the sake of  Old England  and its  African trade  or for the supposed advantage or imaginary necessities of our  American  colonies lay aside our  christian charity  which we owe to  all the rest of mankind  because  whenever we do so  we certain∣ly deserve to be considered in no better light than as an overgrown  society of robbers  a  mere banditti  who per∣haps may  love one another  but at the same time are at enmity with  all the rest of the world  Is this  according to the law of nature  For shame Mr Thompson  I HAVE much more to communi∣cate but no more time to writeif I had I could draw from the scriptures  the most alarming examples of God's severe judgments upon the Jews for tyrannizing over  their brethren  and  expressly  for exceeding the  limits  of  servitude  just now mentioned  a  This I have since accomplished in a tract inti∣tuled "THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION  c  I must find time however to adopt one observa∣tion even from the reverend Mr Thomp∣son p viz  This subject will grow more serious upon our hands when we consider the  buying and sell∣ing Negroes  not as a clandestine or piratical business but as an  open pub∣lic trade encouraged  and promoted by acts of parliament for so if being  contrary to religion it must be deemed  A NATIONAL SIN  b  If this just remark by Mr  Thompson  be com∣pared with the above mentioned tract on  the Law of Retribution  wherein the usual course of  God  's judge ments against NATIONS is fairly demonstrated by a variety of unquestionable examples in the scriptures it will appear that nothing but  a thorough reformation  with respect to the said "NATIONAL SIN" can afford us the least room  even to hope  that THIS NATION may escape the tremendous effects of GODS TEMPORAL VENGEANCE now dreadfully hanging over us  and as such may  have a consequence that  would be always to be dreaded  May God give us grace to repent of this abominable "NATIONAL SIN" before it is too late  If I have vindicated the law of Mo∣ses much easier can I vindicate the be∣nevolent apostle Paul from Mr Thomp∣son's insinuations with respect to slave∣ry for he  did not  entreat  Philemon  to take back his servant  Onesimus  in his former capacity  as Mr  Thompson  has asserted in order to render bond∣age  consistent with the principles of re∣vealed religion  but St  Paul  said  expresly  not now as a servant but  above a servant  a  brother beloved  a  This single circumstance one would think a suf∣ficient bar to the inferences drawn from this epistle in favour of slavery by the reverend Mr  Thompson  and others and yet even the learned Archbishop  Theophy∣lact  seemed inclined to admit the same supposed  right of the master  In the preface to his commentary on this epistle where he gives a short account of the use and purport of it and of the doctrines which may be deduced from it he says  Thirdly That it is not fit through pretence of piety to draw away servants from masters that are unwilling to part with them  " But though the apostle declared indeed to  Philemon  the master v  "without thy mind would I do nothing"  c yet this by no means proves  the right of the master  but only that the apostle in love and courtesy to  Philemon  desired that  "the benefit"  which he required of him  "should not be as it were of necessity but willingly"  ver for the apostle's  right  to have retained  Onesimus  even  without the master's consent  is sufficiently implied in  a  preceding verse viz "  though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin  or command "  thee that which is convenient Yet  said the apostle "  for  LOVE's SAKE  I rather beseech  " c And a further reason for his not  commanding  is also declared viz that he depended on the willing obedience of  Phile∣mon "Having considence  said he  in thy obedience I wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say  " And yet that which he really did  say  or re∣quire in behalf of  Onesimus  was as strong a recom∣mendation to  favour  and  superior kindness  as could be expressed He required him to receive  Onesimus "not now as a servant but above a servant as a  BROTHER  beloved"  c verse that "  if he hath wronged thee or  OWETH OUGHT"  in which expression even the supposed  debt of service  may be included  "put that on my account"  said the apostle ver which must be a complete discharge of all the master's temporal demands on  Onesimus  and therefore it is a strange perversion of the apostle's meaning to cite this epistle  in favour of slavery  when the whole tenor of it is in behalf of the  slave  But there is still a fur∣ther observation necessary to be made which puts the matter out of dispute  Theophylact  himself allows that  Onesimus  at the very time he was sent back was  a minister of the gospel  or a  minister of preaching      But that he should send him back again to the  service  of  preaching  of which he is  a labourer  or minis∣ter Comment on the st verse page  edit London    which is an office of the sacred ministry not beneath the highest order in the church for it was the principal employ∣ment even of the apostle himself  And this opinion of  Theophylact  is corroborated by a variety of circumstances By the epistle to the  Co∣lossians  it appears that  Onesimus  was joined with  Tychi∣cus  therein declared to be a  minister    All my state shall  TYCHICUS  declare  unto you who is  a be∣loved brother  A FAITHFUL MINISTER AND FELLOW SERVANT IN THE LORD  whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might  KNOW YOUR ESTATE AND COMFORT YOUR HEARTS  with  ONESIMUS  a faithful and beloved brother  by which it is apparent that  Onesimus  was joined in the same services "to KNOW THEIR ESTATES AND COMFORT THEIR HEARTS" an office that would have very ill become him had he been sent back to his master as a SLAVE or as Mr  Thompson  says  IN HIS FORMER CAPACITY  "  who is one of you They  that is  Tychicus  and  One∣simus  jointly  shall make known unto you all things which  are done  here" Coloss  iv  in an  ecclesias∣tical commission  from the apostle to the church of the  Colossians  at the very time that he was sent back to  Philemon  Ludov Capellus remarks that these epistles viz to  the Colos∣sians  and to  Philemon  were wrote and consequently sent at the same time and after assigning several reasons for his opinion concludes as follows "  Ex his itaque  says he  liquere puto utramque Episto∣lam simul codem tempore fuisse scriptam  " Hist Apost illust page ed  Genovae    and it would surely have ill become the apostle to send back  Onesimus  then a  minister of the gospel  to serve his master  Philemon in his former capacity  that is as a SLAVE which is the doctrine presumed in page of the reverend Mr  Thompson  's tract Mr  Thompson  as a clergyman ought to have considered that this would not have been for the credit of the  gospel ministry  But  Onesimus  was not only a  minister  and  preacher  but afterwards even a  bishop  which will by no means suit with Mr  Thompson  's doctrine The learned bishop  Fell  testified from the authority of  the ancients  that this  Onesimus  was a bishop  "Onesimus"  says he in his commentary on Colloss iv "  servant to Philemon a chief man in Colosse The antients say that he succeeded Timothy in the  BISHOPRICK  of Ephe∣sus  " And the great archbishop  Usher  makes express mention of  Onesimus  in that  bishoprick  from the au∣thority both of  Eusebius  and  Ignatius  see his little tract de Episcoporum et Metropolitanorum Ori∣gine p ed Lond So that though  Paul  mentions to  Philemon  the receiving ONESIMUS FOR EVER  that thou shouldest receive him  FOREVER" ver yet it would be most unreasonable to conceive that the apostle meant that he should receive him FOR EVER AS A SLAVE The several circumstances I have mention∣ed demonstrate the contrary  c So that Mr  Thompson  has notori∣ously wrested St  Paul  's words  IN the other texts where St  Paul  recommends submission to  Servants  for consciencesake he at the same time enjoins the master to entertain such a measure of  brotherly love  towards his servants as must be entirely subversive of the  African  trade and  WestIndian  slavery And though St  Paul  recom∣mends christian patience under servi∣tude yet at the same time he plain∣ly insinuates that it is inconsistent with  christianity and the dignity of Christ's kingdom that a  christian brother  should  be a  Slave  Can'st thou be made free  says he to the christian servants  choose it rather  for he that is  called  of the Lord  being a servant  is the  freeman  of the Lord and in like  manner he that is called  being free  is the  servant of Christ    Ye are bought with a price  BE NOT THERE∣FORE THE SERVANTS OF MEN  The apostle indeed had just before  recommended to his disciples to  abide in the same calling  wherein they were called and  "being servants not to care for it"  That is not to grieve on account of  their temporal  state for if instead of thus enjoining  submission  he had absolutely declared  the iniquity of  SLAVERY tho'  established  and  au∣thorized  by the laws of  temporal  govern∣ments he would have occasioned more  tumult  than  reformation  among the multitude of SLAVES more striving for  temporal  than  spiritual  happiness yet it plainly appears by the insinua∣tions which immediately follow that he thought it derogatory to the honour of christianity that men  who  are bought  with the inestimable  price of Christ  's blood should be esteemed  servants  that is  the Slaves  and pri∣vate property of other men and had christianity been established by  tempo∣ral  authority in those countries where  Paul  preached as it is at present in these kingdoms we need not doubt but that he would have  urged  nay compelled the masters  as he did Phile∣mon  by the most pressing arguments to treat their quondam slaves  NOT NOW AS SERVANTS BUT ABOVE SERVANTSAS BRETHREN BE∣LOVED  AN ELEGY  On the miserable STATE of an African SLAVE by the celebrated and ingeni∣ous William

of the poor negroes and convicts are beyond all conception being entirely subject to the will of their  savage and brutal masters they are often punished for not doing more than strength and nature will admit of and sometimes because they can't on every occasion fall in with their wanton and capricious hu∣mours One common punishment is to flea their backs with cow hides or other instruments of

loftiest ty∣rant in  America  with a thousand slaves at his beck    APPENDIX N  o    A Letter from  Granville Sharp  to  Ja∣cob Bryant  Esq  concerning the Descent of the Negroes  SIR  I Have conceived a very high opinion of your abilities by perusing your learned account of  Egypt and the Shep∣herd Kings  c and as you seem to have studied very particularly the history of the  Cuseans  and antient  Arabians  you can I apprehend easily resolve some doubts relating thereto which occurred to me on reading your book  I HAD always supposed that black men in general were descended from  Cush  be∣cause a distinction in colour from the rest of mankind seems to have been particu∣larly attributed to his descendants  the Cu∣shim  even to a proverb  Can the Cushi  commonly rendered Ethiopian  change his Skin  c Jeremiah xiii and  therefore I concluded that all negroes as well  East Indian  as  African  are en∣titled to the general name of  Cushim  as being probably descended from dif∣ferent branches of the same stock be∣cause the proverb is equally applicable to both with respect to their complection tho' in many respects they are very dif∣ferent But in p of your learned work where you are speaking of the  Cu∣seans  in general you say that they are  to be found within the tropics almost as low as the Gold coast  c as if you apprehended that the negroes on the Gold coast and below it  were not de∣scended from Cush  Now Sir I shall think myself greatly obliged if you will be pleased to inform me whether you really have any particu∣lar reason to apprehend that the negroes on the coast of  Guinea  from whence our plantations are most commonly supplied are descended from any other stock Or whether their descent can at all be traced  I AM far from having any particular esteem for the negroes but as I think myself  obliged  to consider them as  Men  I am certainly  obliged  also to use my best endeavours to prevent their being treated  as beasts  by our unchristian countrymen who deny them the privileges of  human Nature  and in order to excuse their  own  brutality  will scarcely allow that negroes are  human Beings  THE tracing their descent therefore is a point of some consequence to the subject in which I am now engaged for their defence  * * * *  I am SIR Your most obedient humble Servant GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  th Octr    JACOB BRYANT  Esq  APPENDIX No  Mr  Bryant  's Answer to the foregoing Letter  Cypenham  th Octr    SIR  I MOST sincerely wish you success in your laudable purpose and am very glad to find in these base times that there is a person who will stand up in defence of human nature and not suffer it to be limited to a set of features and complexion There is nothing I believe in my wri∣tings that can affect any argument which you may think proper to urge in favour of those whom you would patro∣nize But to take away all embarras∣ment and uncertainty I will give you my opinion upon the subject which you have stated to me in your letter in respect to the origin of the Nigritae or Negroes You seem to think that all who are of that very deep tint which is  observable in the natives upon the coast of Guinea are the offspring of  Chus  and all black men in general are of the same origin To this I take the liberty to answer that all the natives of  Africa  are more or less swart and even among the negroes there are a great variety of tints from a light copper colour to the darkest black All the inhabitants of this vast continent are assuredly the sons of  Ham  but not equally descended from  Chus  For though his posterity was very dark yet many of the collateral branches were of as deep a die and  Africa  was peopled from  Ham  by more families than one It was possessed by some of them as there is good grounds to sur∣mise before the  Cushites  came into  Egypt  We learn from scripture that  Ham  had four sons  Chus Mizraim Phut  and  Ca∣naan  Gen x v  Canaan  occupied  Pa∣lestine  and the country called by his by his name  Mizraim Egypt  But  Phut  passed deep into  Africa  and I believe most of the nations in that part of the world are descended from him at least more than from any other person  Josephus  says  that Phut was the foun∣der of the nations in Libya  See Josephus Antq lib c  and the  people were from him called      Phuti  By  Libya  he understands as the  Greeks  did  Africa  in general for the particular country called  Libya  proper was peopled by the  Lubim  or  Lehabim  one of the branches from  Mizraim  Chron Paschale p  THE sons of  Phut  settled in  Maurita∣nia  where was a country called  Phutia  and a river of the like denomination  Mauritaniae Fluvius usque ad praesens tempus  Phut  dicitur omnisque circa eum regio  Phutensis  Hieron  s  Tradit Hebraeae Amnem quem vocant▪  Fut  Pliny lib c iSome of this family settled above Egypt near Aethi∣opia and were stiled Troglodytae  syncellus p many of them passed inland and peopled the  Mediterranean  country In process of time after their expulsion from  Egypt  the sons of  Chus  made settlements upon the sea coast of  Africa  and came into  Mauritania  Hence we find traces of them also in the names of places such as  Churis Chusares  upon the coast and a river  Cusa  and a city  Cotta  together with a promontory  Cotis  in  Mauritania  all denominated from  Chus  who at dif∣ferent times and by different people was called  Chus Cuth Cosh  and  Cotis  The river  Cusa  is mentioned by  Pliny  lib  c and by  Ptolomey  Many ages after these settlements there was another ir∣ruption of the  Cushites  into these parts under the name of  Saracens  Query  Whether the  Saracens  may not rather be said to be of the line of  Shem  as being descended from  Abraham  Though indeed both the mother and the wise of  Ishmael  were  Egyptiant  and  Moors  who over ran  Africa  to the very extre∣mities of mount  Atlas  They passed over and conquered  Spain  to the north and they extended themselves southward as I said in my treatise to the rivers  Sene∣gal  and  Gambia  and as low as the  Gold Coast  I mentioned this because I do not think that they proceeded much far∣ther most of the nations to the south being as I imagine of the race of  Phut  The very country upon the river  Gambia  on one side is at this day called  Phuta  of of which  Bluet  in his history of  Juba Ben Solomon  gives an account  It is not possible to discriminate at this aera of time the several casts among the black nations but I should think that we may be pretty certain that they were not all  Cushim  or  Cuseans  The Negroes are woolly headed and so were some of the  Aethiopes  or  Cushim  but nothing can be inferred from this for many of the latter had long hair as we learn from  He∣rodotus  lib c  We  find from  Marcellmus  that the  Egyp∣tians  were  Crispi  and had a tendency to woolly hair so that this circumstance can∣not always be looked upon as a family characteristic  THIS Sir is my opinion concerning the people in question which I submit to your consideration merely as matter of opinion for I cannot pretend to speak with certainty It makes very little dif∣ference in respect to the good cause which your humanity prompts you to es∣pouse whether the Nigritae are  Phutians  or  Cushites  They are certainly the sons of  Ham  and what is more to the pur∣pose they are the work manship of God▪ formed in his image with a living Soul as well as ourselves Consequently they deserve better treatment than they have generally experienced from those who look upon themselves as more enlighten∣ed and possessed of a greater degree of humanity I join with you sincerely in detesting the cruel traffic and am with great truth SIR  Your most obedient and most humble Servant JACOB BRYANT  P S  You are pleased to observe  that a distinction in colour from the rest of man∣kind  seems to have been particularly attri∣buted to the descendants of the Cushim  They certainly were very dark but so were all the sons of  Ham  And it is difficult to say who were the darkest as it was a circumstance depending upon the situation of the people spoken of and upon many occult causes The same family in differ∣ent parts varied from itself as I have shewn from  Herodotus  The sacred writers speak of the  Cushi  's complexion particularly be∣cause they were most acquainted with it as being very near  Shem  There were se∣veral regions called  Cushan  or  Aethiopia  one of which was upon the confines of  Judaea  near  Amalec  and  Edom  but still nearer to  Midian  Hence the prophet  Habbakuh  says in a vision  I saw the tents of  Cushan  in affliction and the cur∣tains of  Midian  did tremble  C iii v These were the  Araba Cushitae  with whom the  Israelites  were most acquainted Of the sons of  Phut  and of the  Ludim Lebabim  and other descendants of  Ham  in  Africa  they had probably little or no cognizance excepting only the  Mizraim  and the  Aethiopians  immediately above them to the south of  Syene  With these they were acquainted Should it be in my power to give you any farther satisfac∣tion I shall be very proud of your com∣mands * * * * * *  THE whole of what you mention that all Moors Negroes and black persons are from one common stock is most assuredly true if you make the head of that family  Ham  instead of  Chus  One remove higher makes every thing strictly consonant to the truth  APPENDIX No  The Regulations lately adopted by the  Spaniards  at the  Havanna  and some other Places for the gradual  enfran∣chisement of Slaves  are to the follow∣ing Effect  AS soon as a slave is landed his name price  c  are registered in a public register and the master is oblig∣ed by law to allow him  one working day  in every week to himself  besides Sundays  so that if the slave chuses to work for his master on that day he receives the  wages of a freeman  for it and whatever he gains by his labour on that day is so secured to him by law that the master cannot de∣prive him of it This is certainly a con∣siderable step towards the abolishing  abso∣lute slavery  As soon as the slave is able to purchase  another working day  the mas∣ter is obliged to sell it to him at a propor∣tionable price  viz  one fifth part of his  original cost and so likewise the re∣maining four days at the same rate as soon as the slave is able to redeem them after which  he is absolutely free  This is such encouragement to industry that even the most indolent are tempted to exert themselves Men who have thus work∣ed out their freedom are enured to the labour of the country and are certainly the most useful subjects that a colony can acquire Regulations might be formed upon the same plan to encourage the in∣dustry of slaves  that are already imported into the colonies  which would teach them how to maintain themselves and be  as useful  as well as  less  expensive to the plan∣ter They would by such means become members of society and have an interest in the welfare of the community which would add greatly to the strength and se∣curity of each colony whereas at pre∣sent many of the plantations are in  conti∣nual danger of being cut off by their slaves  a fate which they but  too justly deserve  APPENDIX No  Extract of a Letter from the Author to a Gentleman at  Philadelphia  and surely there needs no argu∣ment to demonstrate the weakness and dan∣ger of the more southern colonies from  the immense multitude of slaves  that are forci∣bly detained therein  THE congress have acted nobly in for∣bidding the iniquitous importation of  more slaves  but the business is but half done 'till they have agreed upon some equitable and safe means of  gradually enfranchising  those which remain No time should be lost in forwarding this equitable measure and to secure the affections of the ne∣groes assurances should be immediately given of such friendly intentions towards them lest any attack should in the mean while be made in those quarters which  might encourage  an insurrection  I tremble for the probable consequences of such an event for though  domestic slavery  which I detest from my heart would thereby be abolished yet that effect would be wrought at the expence of  public Liberty  and the  tyranny  and injustice of private individuals would seem perhaps to be too severely punished by that horrid carnage and im∣placability which usually attend the con∣flicts between masters and slaves  LET  private interest  therefore give place to  justice  and  right  which will most effec∣tually administer to the public safety  LET it be remembered that many of the negroes are natives of the colonies and consequently have  a natural right  to a  free existence  therein as well as the Land∣holders themselves I shall not presume to  advise  the mode of effecting this im∣portant and necessary enfranchisement but will only offer a few hints in order to promote the consideration and determina∣tion of those who are best able to judge of the matter  SUPPOSE the value of every slave now in the colonies was to be fairly estimated by juries appointed for that purpose and the value to be entered under their inspection as a pecuniary  debt  due from each negroe to his master in a public register for each district Suppose also that the landholders  who do not occupy all their grounds were advised to divide what lands they can spare into  compact little farms  with a small wooden cottage to each which should be allotted to those negroes only who are natives of the colony or else have been so long in it that their dispositions are sufficiently known whether or not they may safely be entrust∣ed with their liberty Let such negroes hold these small portions of land by leases for a certain term of years and at equitable rents to be paid in such portions of  the produce  from time to time as shall be thought most reasonable leaving the ten∣ants a moderate gain besides their neces∣sary subsistence to encourage industry and yet so as to yield the landlords a due profit from each portion of their estates besides an adequate allowance to reimburse within the limited time not only the registered price of their quondam slaves but also whatever sums they may have advanced to∣wards the expence of  building  of  implements  of  live stock  of  seed c c  the amount of which ought to be added to the first debt and registered in like manner before the leases are executed By these means the landlords will lose nothing of their wealth and yet the most useful and worthiest of the negroes will acquire a  natural interest  in the welfare and safety of the community which will insure their assistance against  any hostile attempt of the rest Other negroes that are not capable of managing and shifting for themselves nor are fit to be trusted all at once with liberty might be delivered over to the care and protection of a county committee in order to avoid the baneful effects of  private property in men  and might by the said committee be let out as  hired servants  to such persons as would undertake the charge of them to be paid also  in produce  towards the dis∣charge of the registered debt for each man's original price and the labourer himself in the mean while to be allow∣ed one day in a week beside the Sun∣day for his own profit or be paid for it according to the mode of the  Spanish regulations  which I before trans∣mitted that he may have an opportuni∣ty to acquire a little property of his own which will  prepare his mind  as well as his circumstances  for freedom  by enabling him as a member of the community to shift for himself at the time of his dis∣charge By some such regulations as these slavery might be changed into a condition more nearly resembling that of  hired servants  as no master would be the  absolute proprietor  of those he employs and yet all reasonable advantages arising from their labour would remain which must occasion a reciprocal improvement in the morality and humanity both of mas∣ters  and servants and in process of time instead of  wretched slaves  a new and use∣ful order of men at present unknown in America where every  freeman  cultivates his own ground only would be established amongst you I mean a hardy body of  free peasants  serving either as  trusty ten∣ants  or  farmers  to improve the estates of landed gentlemen or else as  laborious cot∣tagers  who might be employed with in∣finite advantage to the neighbourhood wherever established especially if they were encouraged by an allotment of a small patch of land for a potatoe ground or garden with a right of pasture for a little live stock upon some common field in the neighbourhood of their little cot∣tagesLandholders by this means would have their estates better peopled and im∣proved and yet avoid the guilt and dan∣ger of oppression In the mean while the hours of labour should be uniformly regu∣lated to prevent the oppression of avari∣cious exactors and the danger of discon∣tent and schools should be opened in every district to give the poor labourers and their children some general ideas of morality and religious knowledge which constitute the most effectual  bond of peace  These regulations I mention only by way of hint you have the same earnest regard  for the cause of  general liberty  and  the natural rights of mankind  that I have and much greater abilities to defend them and to propose a more perfect system than what is here suggested Let me therefore intreat you to consider this matter and to forward as soon as possible some scheme of general enfranchisement because Ame∣rican liberty cannot be firmly established 'till this is done  I am with great esteem Dear SIR Your affectionate friend and humble servant GRANVILLE SHARP  London  July  APPENDIX No  Extract from Mr  Morgan  's Book in∣tituled  A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery in the West Indies  Page  Nothing can be more opposite to every idea of justice and mo∣rality than the present practice of buying slaves to cultivate the West Indian islands and the southern provinces on the conti∣nent of America nor can any thing I  think be eventually more fatal  ***  Page  Yet something out of worldly prudence ought to be donefor as this evil has been violently introduced contrary to the natural course of things and the constitution of the world it will one day find a remedy even in its excess Matters will be fatally brought to a crisis and nature will vindicate her own laws  and restore the credit of her equal and just administration to the lasting punish∣ment of those who abused it THIS WILL BE WHEN THE BLACKS OF THE SOUTHTHERN COLONIES ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA SHALL BE NUMEROUS ENOUGH TO THROW OFF AT ONCE THE YOKE OF TYRANNY TO REVENGE THEIR WRONGS IN THE BLOOD OF THEIR OP∣PRESSORS AND CARRY TERROR AND DESTRUCTION TO THE MORE NORTHERN SETTLEMENTS Such a revolution can∣not take place in the islands until this period on account of the want of intel∣ligence and communication between the slaves of one island and another and of the easy communication and mutual as∣sistance of whites But an insurrection on the continent once communicated will be an incitement in the islands and a sig∣nal for a general and but that every Englishman is alike concerned and the planter not peculiarly criminal A MERIT∣ED CARNAGE  Nothing can be conceived MORE DE∣STRUCTIVE MORE INSATIATE THAN THE WARS WHICH WILL FOLLOW THIS EVENT they will be every where marked with THE MOST HORRIBLE CRUELTIES and THE MOST FURIOUS REVENGE The distinction of  black  and  white  which we  have so unreasonably made the marks of  freedom  and  slavery  will then become the obvious colours of mutual hostility and revenge and it seems likely that these wars MAY END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE WHITES because the blacks as will be presently observed will increase faster and because their nature seems better able to bear the severity of cold than the whites can that of heat    c  APPENDIX No  A Copy of what  is said  to be the substance of Lord  Mansfield  's speech in the case of  Somerset  and  Knowles  ON Monday the d June in Trinity term the court of  King  's  Bench  proceeded to give judgement in the Case of  Somerset  and  Knowles  upon the re∣turn of the Habeas Corpus LORD MANS∣FIELD first stated the return and then spoke to the following purport which is taken from the second edition of a Tract printed in intituled  Considera∣tions on the Negroe Cause so called ad∣dressed to the right honourable lord  Mans∣field  lord chief justice of the court of King's Bench by  SAMUEL ESTWICK  A M Assistant Agent for the island of  Barbadoes  page vii  viz  WE pay due attention to the opinion of Sir  Philip Yorke  and Mr  Talbot  in the year by which they pledged themselves to the British planters for the  legal consequences of bringing Negroeslaves into this kingdom or their being baptiz∣ed which opinion was repeated and re∣cognized by lord Hardwicke sitting as chancellor on the th of October to the following effect he said  that trover would lay for a negroeslave that a notion prevailed that if a slave came into England or became a Christian he there∣by became emancipated but there was no foundation in law for such a notion that when he and Lord Talbot were attorney and solicitor general this notion of a slave becoming free by being baptized per∣vailed so strongly that the planters indus∣triously prevented their becoming chris∣tians upon which their opinion was taken  and upon their best consideration they were both clearly of opinion  that a slave did not in the least alter his situation or state to∣wards his master or  owner  either by be∣ing christened or coming to England that though the statute of Charles II had abolished    homage  ‡ See a part of my lord  Mansfield  's speech printed in the Appendix p of  a Treatise upon the Trade from  Great Britain  to  Africa  by an African merchant  wherein this word  "homage"  is inserted    tenure so far that no man could be a  Villein regardant  yet if he would acknowledge himself a  Villein  engrossed in any court of record he  knew of no way by which he could be en∣titled to his freedom without the consent of his master  We feel the force of the inconveniences and consequences that will follow the decision of this question yet all of us are so clearly of one opinion upon the  only  question before us that we think we ought to give judgment without adjourning the matter to be argued before all the judges as usual in the habeas cor∣pus and as we at first intimated an inten∣tion of doing in this case The only ques∣tion then is  Is the cause returned sufficient for the remanding him If not  he must be discharged The cause returned is the  slave  absented himself and departed from his master's service and refused to return and serve him during his stay in  England  whereupon by his master's orders he was put on board the ship by force and there detained in secure custody to be carried out of the kingdom and sold So high an act of dominion must derive its autho∣rity if any such it has from the law of the kingdom  where  executed A foreig∣ner cannot be imprisoned  here  on the au∣thority of any law existing in his own coun∣try The power of a master over his ser∣vant is different in all countries more or less limited or extensive the exercise of of it therefore must always be regulated  by the laws of the place where exercised The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being now intro∣duced by courts of justice upon mere rea∣soning or inferences from any principles natural or political it must take its rise from  positive law  the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source Immemorial usage preserves the memory of  positive law  long after all traces of the occasion reason authority and time of its introduction are lost and in A CASE SO ODIOUS AS THE CONDITION OF SLAVES MUST BE TAKEN STRICTLY  Tracing the subject to natural princi∣ples the claim of slavery never can be sup∣ported  ‡ These additions in Italics between hooks before and after the words "THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE" are taken from the notes of a very ingenious and able counsellor who was present when the judgement was givenThe rest of his notes sufficiently agree in substance with what Mr  Estwick  has printed  THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE or  acknowledged by the law  No master ever was allowed here to take a slave by force to be sold abroad because he had deserted from his service or for any other reason whatever WE CANNOT SAY  the cause set forth by this return  IS ALLOW∣ED  OR APPROVED OF BY THE LAWS OF THIS KINGDOM and therefore the man must be discharged  Upon this Mr  Estwick  has been pleased to observe as follows  i must confess  says he  I have been greatly puzzled in endeavouring to reconcile this judgement with this state of it and with my comprehension  c  But the writer quoted by the  African merchant  before mentioned is not so modest in his censure of this judgement nor so honest in his  re∣cital  of it as Mr  Estwick  for he partially conceals the most material part of the learn∣ed judge's speech because it happens to make against his own wicked cause and tells us by way of excuse for so notorious and partial an omissionthat  the remain∣der of the speech is too vague to come into consideration  c p Another anony∣mous writer author of a pamphlet intitled  CANDID REFLECTIONS  upon  THE JUDGE∣MENT  lately awarded by the Court of King's Bench in Westminster Hall on what is com∣monly  called the NEGROE CAUSE  by  a  Plan∣ter  after comparing this JUDGEMENT of the King's Bench with the opinions of the judges  Holt  and  Powel  and those of the attorney and solicitor general  York  and  Tal∣bot  c is pleased to  reflect  thereupon as follows  A point  says he  upon which these great Oracles of the law have published  such opposite sentiments seems as far as ever from being established upon the solid ground of absolute  PRECISION  The planters of course have been left  says he  as much puzzled by this  DELPHIC AMBIGUITY  as the sages themselves appear to have been in forming their judgements upon the subject The mat∣ter having been  CONFOUNDED  in this  GRAND UNCERTAINTY  c p But these heavy charges of the want of "PRECISION" of "DELPHIC AMBIGUITY" and of being  CONFOUNDED in GRAND UN∣CERTAINTY  c are so far from being "CANDID REFLECTIONS" as this author would have us believe them that even  his own evidence  on the proceeding page clear∣ly proves the falsehood and injustice of this censures for he has there given us the EFFECT of that late judgment of the court of King's Bench in THE CLEAREST TERMS without the least  doubt  or  difficulty  so that the  delphic ambiguity  of which he  immediate∣ly after  complains must be even accord∣ing to his own evidence a mere  calumny  After reciting the opinion of lord chief justice  Holt  he immediately adds as follows  Lord chief justice mansfield  says he  adds to this effect  That the laws of  Great Britain  do not authorize a master to  reclaim  his fugi∣tive SLAVE  confine  or  transport  him out of the kingdom In other words  says  he  that a negroe slave coming from the colonies into  Great Britain  becomes  ipso facto  FREE  Thus notwithstanding the  uncandid re∣flections  of this author about DELPHIC AM∣BIGUITY yet even  he himself  has without  doubt  or  difficulty  declared THE  certain  and  unavoidable  EFFECT of the judgement de∣livered by Lord  Mansfield  That this au∣thor notwithstanding his prejudices and unjust censures about ambiguity has real∣ly stated the  certain  and  unavoidable  EFFECT of the said judgment will appear by the following remarks upon it  APPENDIX No  Remarks on the Judgment of the Court of  King  's  Bench  in the Case of  Stewart  and  Somerset  By  Gran∣ville Sharp  THIS judgment will not appear doubt∣ful and inexplicit as some have too hastily esteemed it if the whole be taken together and THE EFFECT of it be duly considered  LORD  Mansfield  pronounced the senti∣ments or judgment  of the whole bench  and therefore if any thing was wrong the blame ought not to rest on him alone ne∣vertheless if we fairly examine what was said we shall find no room for blame or cavil His lordship said  WE  pay due attention  to the opinion of Sir  Philip York  and Mr  Talbot  in the year  Now the purport of that opinion was that the master  may legally compel  his slave  to return to the plantations  LORD  Mansfield  modestly declined giving a direct contradiction in express words to the opinion of two such very eminent and learned lawyers but chose rather to con∣demn it tacitly by  the effect  of the judg∣ment which he was about to pronounce and therefore he merely recited the opinion without the least comment and proceeded to the determination of the court upon the case before them which is clear and incon∣trovertible with respect to the main point of the question viz the power claimed by the master of carrying away his slave by force  The power claimed by this return  said the chief justice  was never in use here or ac∣knowledged by the law  Now it was cer∣tainly the duty of the court to give judg∣ment according to  the known laws  and not to be influenced by  any opinion  whatsoever  THEY acknowledged indeed the having  "paid due attention"  to the said opinion but as their determination was diametrically opposite to the assertions in that opinion it is manifest that the court  did not think it grounded in law  according to which alone they were bound to determine The con∣clusion of lord  Mansfield  's speech contains  more substantial and unanswerable reasons for the judgment he was about to give than the generality of his hearers perhaps were aware of for he very ingeniously expressed in the small compass of two short sentences that the masters claim was contrary to three principal foundations of the  English  law viz NATURE USE or  Custom  and the WRITTEN LAW which last also includes two other foundations viz MAXIMS and STATUTES With respect to the first he said  traceing the subject to  NATURAL  princi∣ples the claim of  SLAVERY  never can be supported  With respect to the second he said  The power claimed by this return was never in  USE  here  and thirdly that it was "never  acknowledged by  THE LAW"  THESE seem to have been  the reasons  of the determination and consequently the court was obliged  by the common law  which always favours LIBERTY  Law favoureth life  LIBERTY  and  DOWER  LIBERTAS  est res inestimablis  ' Jenk Cent  Law regards the  PERSON  above his possessions    IFE and LIBERTY  most  c Principia Legis et Aequit p  to dis∣charge the man from the  unnatural  and  un∣precedented  claims of his master which was accordingly done so that the true meaning of this determination is rendered clear and incontrovertible as well by  the effect of it  as by the unanswerable  reasons  above men∣tioned  THAT there is nothing  doubtful  or  inexplicit  in this  judgement  delivered by lord  Mansfield  will further appear by the following report of a case in the PREROGATIVE COURT wherein this very determination on  Somerset  's case is expressly cited and the EFFECT of it clearly and fully declared by a learned judge of that court And the propriety of the said judgment has very lately been still fur∣ther confirmed by a decree also in THE HIGH COURT OF ADMIRALTY after a very learn∣ed and solemn debate concerning the  legality  or  illegality of slavery in England  wherein the merits of the question on both sides was fully examined and discussed A short state of the Case together with the substance of the decree will be found in Appendix No The offence expressed in this latter Case was so flagrantly wicked in all its cir∣cumstances and upon the whole was so notorious a contempt of the laws and con∣stitution of this kingdom as well as of  natu∣ral right  and common honesty that all persons who have any regard for justice must be moved with indignation against the authors of the mischief and must wish to see them corrected by some  adequate  and  exempla∣ry punishment  instead of a decision against them for the mere  recovery of wages  In order therefore to prevent any unjust prejudice of well meaning people against the manner of proceeding in this case for redress it is ne∣cessary  to remark that the negroe did not '  apply for redress of these injuries  ' till more than two years after they were committed whereby he was deprived of the  satisfaction  to which THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT would otherwise have entitled him  IN ANY OF HIS MAJESTY'S COURTS OF RECORD  viz  to recover his treble costs besides damages which damages so to be given  lays the act  shall not be less than  FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS  that is  five hundred pounds  from  each  offen∣dorfrm  every individual  concerned and these seem in the present case to have been more than or that had either been '  ad∣vising aiding  or '  assisting  ' in so flagrant a breach of the peace and they would like∣wise have been subject to all the '  pains pe∣nalties forfeitures losses  or  dissabilities  ordained in THE STATUTE  of

goods and chattels  which he accord∣ingly did but omitted the  negroe  This omission  was made a ground of excep∣tion to the inventory as being therefore not  perfect  UPON argument it was said by the coun∣cil on behalf of  Crichton  that by a very late case in the King's Bench of  Knowles  a Knowles  was the master of the ship who detain∣ed  Somerset  by order of Mr  Stewart  who claimed the latter as his  property  and Somerset  negroes were declared  to be free in England  and consequently they could not be the subjects of  property  or be con∣sidered as any part of a personal estate  IT was answered that the case above∣mentioned was determined only in that A B died in at which time negrees were in some respects considered as property and therefore that he ought to have been included in the account  THE judge Dr  Hay  said that this court had no right to try any question rela∣ting to freedom and slavery but as  Negroes  had been  declared free  by the court which had the proper jurisdiction that determina∣tion referred to them as well at the pre∣ceeding time as at the present and therefore directed that article in which the  negroe  was mentioned to be struck out of the  ex∣ceptive allegation  APPENDIX No  High Court of Admiralty before Sir  Geo Hay  Knt LLD  June  CASE  ROGERS  alias  RIGGES  against  JONES  Dr  Wynne  Dr  Bever  Proctor Torriano  Dr  Harris  Dr  Calvert  Proctor Holman  GEORGE ROGERS alias RIGGES a negro about nineteen years of age had been a servant to several gentlemen in  England  and in the summer of  being then out of place became ac∣quainted with  John Latter  and  John Sessins  who contracted with  Arthur Jones  for the sale of him an assignment was accordingly drawn for that purpose and signed by  John Latter  by which  Rogers  was transferred to Messrs  Mason  and  Jones  as a slave for the sum of twelve guineas  SOME time in August after the sale above mentioned  Rogers  under some false pretences was carried on board the ship  Britannia  then lying at  Deptford  of which Messrs  Mason  and  Jones  were owners was there detained against his will and that hemight not escape was carried down into the sail room by order of the chief mate and the gratings were put upon him In this confinement he was kept till the ship set sail when he was released and suffer∣ed to go about upon deck but not being entered in the ship's books as a mariner nor having any particular office or wages assigned to him he was set to work about the ship's duty in general till he was ap∣pointed as an assistant to the cook which office he executed sometimes as assistant and sometimes as principal cook during the whole voyage The ship first sailed to the coast of  Africa  on the SLAVE TRADE  and from thence to  Porto Rico  where he was offered to sale by the captain of the  Britannia  as a prime slave but  Rogers  having found an opportunity of relating his story to the  Spanish  merchants they refused to purchase him he therefore returned with the ship in which he still acted in his former capacity of assistant cook and upon their arrival in the port of  Lon∣don  in  May  when the other ma∣riners were paid and discharged he was still detained on board against his will  HERE he continued for some time till he contrived to give the officers the slip and by the assistance and advice of some friends went to  Doctors Commons  and ap∣plied to Mr  Faulckner  a proctor to put him in a way of recovering his wages or some other recompence for his labour Mr  Faulckner  accordingly wrote to  Arthur Jones  one of the owners for that purpose and  Rogers  being ap∣pointed likewise to meet  Jones  at the proctor's office was waiting at a pub∣lic house in  Doctors Commons  till sent for when  Jones Seffins  and another man came into the house forced  Ro∣gers  into a coach conveyed him back and forced him on board another ship where he was chained to the main∣mast till he was released by the deputy∣marshal of the High Court of Admiralty with the assistance of Mr  Shea  one of his old masters and some other friends who had obtained a warrant to take him out of his confinement  SEVERAL reasons prevented his ap∣plying for redress of these injuries till the beginning of the year when Mr  Torriano  was employed to commence an action against  Arthur Jones  as one of the owners for the purpose of recovering the usual wages or some other recompence in lieu there∣of  AFTER the usual proceedings the cause was brought for hearing on June when the facts being all clearly proved as above stated the prin∣cipal question was  How far the plea of SLAVERY set up by the defendant could be admitted in bar of the demand of wages  IT was insisted on by the counsel on be∣half of  Rogers  that the kind of slavery here spoken of never had any existence under the laws of  England  and in support of that referred to the well known Case  of  Knowles  and  Somerset  before lord  Mansfield  and likewise to a late one in the PREROGATIVE COURT of  Cay  and  Crichton  THE counsel for the defendant argu∣ed that till the case of  Somerset  the law of  England  admitted slavery and in support of this they quoted the au∣thority of Lord Chief Justice  Hale  and in particular the opinions of the Lords  Talbot  and  Hardwick  THE Decree of the Court thereupon was in substance as follows  THERE are two principal points in this cause  said the Judge  st  Whether such a service is proved as stated in the summary Petition as to enti∣tle the plaintiff to the wages demanded and  dly  Whether the plea of slavery shall be a sufficient bar to the claim  With regard to the  FIRST  it appears by the fullest evidence that the plaintiff had serv∣ed on board the ship either in the capacity of assistant to the cook or as cook himself during the greatest part of the voyage and consequently was entitled to some recompence for his services but not being entered as a mariner in the ship's book nor having any  stipulated wages assigned him it being proba∣ble that the owners meant to sell him again in the West Indies he cannot be allowed any spe∣cific sum under the name of  WAGES  but as be certainly performed the duty to which he was assigned without any objection to his be∣haviour in it the maritime law clearly gives him a  QUANTUM MERUIT  The cook's wages appear to have been  £  s    d per Month which is more than  Rogers  mast probably could fairly deserve But upon in∣spection of the mariners contract it appears that there were several negroe boys in the same ship in the quality of apprentices who were allowed from    s to    s and    d per month  he signified his opinion therefore  that  Rogers  might fairly deserve    s per month  which he accordingly decreed him from the time of his being first carried on board  With regard to the  SECOND  point it was urged  said the judge  that the plaintiff was a  SLAVE  and consequently was not entitled to any reward for his service at all  The practice of buying and selling slaves  the learned judge remarked  was cer∣tainly very common in  England  before the case of  SOMERSET  in the Court of King's Bench    but however it might have been the law of the Royal Ex∣change  he hoped  it never was the law of  England  The  OPINIONS  of lord  Hardwicke  and lord  Talbot  when Attorney and Solicitor general have been quoted in support of this practice and have formerly given too much countenance to it though they seemed origi∣nally to have been only applied to the diffe∣rence created by baptism  But by a late determination of one of the ablest judges that ever presided in this king∣dom these opinions have been held to be mis∣taken and unsound and there can be no fur∣ther doubt that the claim of  SLAVERY  is not maintainable by the laws of  England  The law therefore was the same before the time of the above opinions as since and con∣sequently refers to all sales whatsoever of this nature which are every one illegal and therefore the pretended sale in the present case in    was an absolute nullity and when the allegation stating the sale was admitted on behalf of the owners had  Rogers  appeared under protest upon this point of law it would have been received in bar of the plea  The owners seem to have acted upon a mistaken notion of their right but as the claim of slavery is clearly against the law of this country and as it appeared that  Rogers  had always acted in some useful capacity dur∣ing the whole time of his having been on board  the judge said he thought  him entitled to a  QUANTUM MERUIT  for his service  which he accordingly fixed as above and condemned the owners in costs which were immediately taxed to the amount of £  s    d  APPENDIX No  From the General Evening Post No  June  th  To the Editor of the  General Evening Post  SIR  AS the great cause depending between Mr  Stuart  and  Somerset  the negro is at present one of the principal topics of general conversation by inserting the fol∣lowing you will afford a seasonable and ra∣tional entertainment to your readers I am your's c  Extract of a letter from a person in  Mary∣land  to his friend in  Philadelphia  I am so happy as to think as you do with regard to trading in man or keep∣ing  him a slave The custom is wicked and iniquitous neither consistent with reason or the laws of God or man Poor unhappy slaves particularly those forced from their places of nativity are most certainly deplorable objects of com∣miseration I never bought more than two during twenty years residence here One proved to be the son of an African Prince he was a most comely youth hav∣ing observed his uncommon good parts I sent him to school and used him like a free man during his stay with me The directors of the African Company having enquired and offered a reward for him I by a public act presented the poor crea∣ture with his freedom gave him an order for the reward aforesaid and sent him to London from whence the following year he remitted me the same sum he cost me and sundry rich goods to the amount of three hundred pounds and upwards and therewith a letter in his own native lan∣guage translated by Dr Desaguillier of Cambridge  The next I purchased was an unhap∣py lad kidnapped from his free pa∣rents at the taking of Guadaloupe During his stay with me he decayed or pined so much and expressed so sensible a sorrow of cruel separation from his  aged parents relations and countrymen that actuated by the unerring good provi∣dence which directs us in all our good deeds I likewise set this poor creature free and sent him to his native place Providence again would not excuse my being further rewarded for performing this my duty as a Christian The truly honest father from the produce of his plantations has made me presents to the amount of fifty pounds sterling with direction to draw upon him for the full cost of the poor youth which I do never intend being more than paid by presents  I write this to convince you that the in∣habitants of Africa are not such senseless brutish creatures as thoughtless authors represent them to be they undoubtedly are capable of receiving instruction and far outdo Christians in many commend∣able virtues Poor creatures their great∣est unhappiness is being acquainted with  Christians  The worthy and benevolent writer must mean such  Christians  only as those who carry out with them nothing of that most amiable profession of religion but  the name  to the '  shipwrack  ' of their own souls and to the disgrace of their native country if that also is called  Christian  The following is a letter from the Negro Prince some time after he arrived at  London  to his master in  Maryland  Translated by Dr  Desaguillier  of  Cambridge    From the great city d moon after my release  O my kind merciful master my good white brother too good a very good son of a good woman and of a very good old man created good old people by the GREAT SPIRIT who made my country thy poor I should say heretofore poor most grate∣ful black prisoner now rendered rich by thy goodness and mercy is now most dead most drunk most mad with joy Why is he so because he is going to his good warm country to his good old mo∣ther to his good old father to his little sister and his brother In my good warm country all things are good except the white people who live there and come in flying houses to take away poor black priso∣ners from their mothers their fathers their sisters and brothers to kill them with hun∣ger and filth in the cellars of their flying∣houses wherein if they do not die fast  enough and poor prisoners talk for bread and water and want to feel the wind and to see THE GREAT SPIRIT to com∣plain to him to tell him all or to see the trees of his good warm country once more for the last time the King of the white people  prabably the negro meant the captain  orders the officer called Jack to kill many of the black prisoners with whips with ropes knives axes and salt The governor of thy flying house has been to shew that which is to carry me and him to my good warm country I am glad very glad indeed He goes there with wine Should he be sick and white people seldom escape being so there be∣cause of thee my kind merciful master and good white brother and because he has been good to me and is a very good white man too I will nurse him myself my mother my father my little sister and my brother shall be his brother his mother his father and his sister too he shall have one large heap of ele∣phants teeth and gold for thee my kind merciful master and kind brother and one for himself also but smaller He at present is my father I eat at his house and lie there too upon the bed thou pre∣sented me with His woman is my mo∣ther  and kindly nurses me being very sick of the sea and fire made of black stones I have received a great quantity of gold besides what thou did present me with by means of thy hand writing to the people who are to send me to my country some part whereof I have given to the governor of thy swimminghouse to be sent to thee had I an houseful should send the whole with equal plea∣sure however thou shalt see hereafter that black people are not beasts and do know how to be grateful After thou my kind merciful master and good white bro∣ther left me in thy swiminghouse we thy white people and we thy grateful black prisoners were by the GREAT SPIRIT who was angry with us sent by the wind into an immense great river where we had like to have been drowned and where we could see neither sun nor moon for six days and nights I was dying during one whole moon the governor was my father and gave me those good things thou presented me with on my bed he lodged me in the little room thy carpenter built for me Thou gave me more cloaths than I could carry yet I was very cold nothing avail∣ed with poor black prisoner till at last hav∣ing THE GREAT SPIRIT to send me safe to thy house on shore I thought I was carried  there  this appears to have been a dream  where thou my good white brother did use me with wonted goodness spake to THE GREAT SPIRIT and TO HIS SON that I might keep so during the voyage and af∣terwards which they have done for thy sake they will always do me good because of thee my good white brother therefore my kind merciful master do not forget thy poor black prisoner When thou dost speak to THE GREAT SPIRIT and TO HIS SON I do know he will hear thee I shall never be sick more for which I shall be thank∣ful Pray speak for my good old mother my good father my little sister and my brother I wish they may be healthy to many very many moons as many as the hairs on thy head I love them all much yet I think not so much as I do thee I could die in my country for thee could I do thee any kindness Indeed THE GREAT SPIRIT well knows I mean no lie shall always speak to him for thy good believe me my good white brother thy poor black prisoner is not a liar  Dgiagola son of Dgiagola
