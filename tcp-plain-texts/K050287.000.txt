 AN ESSAY At a PLAIN EXPOSITION OF THAT  Difficult Phrase  A GOOD PEACE  By the Author of the  REVIEW  Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price  d    INTRODUCTION  THE Subject I have here undertaken is so Nice and a plain treating of it so Difficult so Dangerous and especially in me so liable to the Censures of Prejudices on both Sides that it has been with some Hesitation that I go about it  Not that I am so Solicitous of whom I please or displease in my handling this Nice▪ Affair for he that is so can never speak with an impartial Freedom a Liberty absolutely necessary to the clear stating Things of doubtful Acceptation and a Liberty which when I cease to preserve to my self I shall cease to write at all  It is very hard with me in this Case more than with any other Author in that whereas others are wary in what they Write for fear of displeasing the Government and irritating Men in Power my▪ Difficulty is a Clamour raised by them who without Arrogance I may▪ say cannot Confute me pretending that I am too Careful to please Men in Power in which as  my Lord  Rochester  said of his  Whore  I have the Scandal without the Joy the Reproach without the Profit of the Charge But as the same Men brought the same Charge when the other Party was in Power and thought it as much a Crime I appeal to all the World what heed ought to be given to their Censure I only introduce this with a brief Challenge to them let them find any change of Principle in all I have written if they can and if what I wrote under the late Ministry and under this Ministry agrees it must be some Body else that has changed Principle not me let the Issue determine it  I would be glad to please every Body but my Aim is to speak Truth with Honesty if it please no Body I am not Solicitous so it be but Truth and Honesty he that can say it is not let him stand forth and be seen he that cannot contradict the Truth I speak will have but small Success in Calumniating the Honesty with which I speak it  And yet I had not entred now upon this Subject but that the Writers of the Town according to the Usage I have some Years been treated with laying all their Bastards at my Door and almost every Book being called mine as well of one Side as the other I thought my self a  little obliged to declare my self and let you all know my Notions of Things with my Name to them that I may no longer bear the Scandals of the present Filth of the Press with Pardon for that Expression  Hitherto I have said nothing on the Subject nor do I purpose to say any thing but what I will fairly own and defend and that I hope may answer the People who call every thing they don't like by my Name  I am not apt to make Apologies and I entreat the Reader to place this Impertinence to the account of the Ages Follies which oblige me to it in Order to Defend my self from a Charge so Unjust as that of being the Author of Books which I never gave my self the Trouble so much as to read  AN ESSAY c  PEACE without other Encomiums it is sufficient to say merits every Man's Approbation and tho' the whole Town is agitated and angry about it yet no Man will be found among us but what will readily own he is for PEACE  It would be happy for us all if we could talk of Peace with a little more of it in our Tempers that we could be at Peace when we pretend to desire Peace it is to me the strangest Thing in the World that we are all falling together by the Ears and making War about Peace If you talk of one Man who otherwise we lik'd well enough hang him he is a Rogue he is come over  he is for Peace  The other Side are even with us and they talking with this or that Acquaintance who  Tom  or  Jack  Ay He is an Honest Fellow enough a good Natur'd Fellow enough but he is got in  with these furious People he is all for Blood nothing but carrying on the War and pushing all things to Extremities Death and Destruction are always in his Mouth he is Mad if you do but talk of Peace to him  Unhappy Nation What End can these Things lead us to Not a Publick Society not a Coffeehouse not a Meeting of Friends not a Visit but like  Jehu  to  Jezabel who is on my Side  Who Who is for Peace Who is for carrying on the War Society is converted into Cabal all Publick Meetings appear sorted into Committees or bandyed into Sides as their Notions of Peace or War encline them  I cannot but make one brief Observation which may have some Philosophy in it and I dare say it is all natural the Note may have its Uses in it which every one may improve as they see fit When you find Men sitting in a Publick Room say a Coffeehouse or Tavern and talking of the Publick Two to One of my Money before you hear a Word they say that I tell you at first who are for Peace and who are for War The Gentlemen who are for PEACE you hear them but at a small Distance their Voices are low their Speech deliberate their Words are soft calm and spoken easie like the Subject they speak of  The other Side that are for War you may hear them into the Street or down the Stairs their Voices are Thunder they speak the Word War with something of the Noise of War as if they were giving in the Field the Word of Command or bidding a Platoon give Fire Again look in their Faces the Men of Peace have it in their Countenances their Faces are covered with Smiles a sort of Calm and Smoothness of Temper sits on their Brow they look pleased and serence like the Spirit that possesses them The Men that are for War seem in a Ferment their Eyes sparkle something Boisterous appears in their Faces they look as uneasie as they talk and the aversion they have to Peace shows it self in their Countenances some cross Lines seem to be drawn over their Faces by which they discover the Temper they stand in as to the Thing that they have in Debate  Well however come near to these Gentlemen and Argue closely with them and you shall find them all join in this that Peace in its general Acceptation is a Blessing which no Man can have a real stated Aversion to the Offspring of Heaven and an Emblem of Eternal Blessedness no Man can open his M  uth against Peace  as such  nor are the Gentlemen I am speaking of who are against  Peace at this Time against it in this Sense let no Man mistake me I am not writing a Satyr against any Body 'Tis the unhappy Circumstances of the present National Temper  that I am speaking of  that we are uneasie to one another Differing Disputing Caballing and sometimes downright Quarelling  and about what  Not Peace in General no every one is for that but the Peace now to be treated of between the Confederates and the King of  France  that's the Uneasiness  Nor  to do every one Justice  is the Question among us whether we shall make Peace with  France  or no every Man of Sense every Man of Principle every Man that has any knowledg of the Circumstances of the Nation or Concern for its Prosperity and Happiness wishes for Peace no Man will say that he is not for Peace the very War is made for Peace it is the Condition of every Manifesto every Declaration all the Alliances all the Articles of the Confederacies which lay down the Causes and Beginnings of the War are full of it Peace Peace to restore the Tranquility of  Europe  to restore the Liberty of  Europe  to restore the Ballance of Power in  Europe  the whole War turns upon this Point And to be very plain the Justice the Honour and the Reputation of the  Confederacy can be supported and defended upon no other Foundation nothing else can justifie the Allies for taking up Arms neither do they pretend to any other Justification of it  the Word is  the Necessity they are driven to there being no other way left them to obtain Peace Indeed no War is just but what is made for Peace nothing but Peace can make War lawful So that Peace being the only thing pretended to in the undertaking this War for any Man to say they do not desire Peace is to say they Fight as the Great  Turk  does for his Pleasure for Encrease of his Dominions for Conquest and the extending his Power which is just as much to be Defended as the Pyrates of  Madagascar  or as Robbing on the Highway and no otherwise  But to come to the Point the particular Objection lies another way it is not a Peace in General that our People object against but the Nature and Circumstances of the Peace and here we give the  Peace  an  Epithet  which requires some Enquiry into A GOOD PEACE this is the Distinction this alone it is that our whole Dispute turns upon and the Exposition of the true Meaning or Acceptation of this Word is the Subject of this Undertaking  A GOOD PEACE say the Objectors we are all for but not such a Peace as you would have or as you would make and this is the state of the Case Two Men quarrelling together in this Town One a  West  Countryman the other a  North  Countryman among some Scurrility that past between them says  West  to his Antagonist I am no  Yorkshireman  why says  North What have you to say to  Yorkshire Are there not a great many Honest Men in  Yorkshire  I would have you know  There are as Honest Men in  Yorkshire  as in any Part of  England Ay ay says  West  that may be true for ought I know  but that is called Honesty in  Yorkshire  which is not Honesty in other Places  This is something like our Case as one Sort who are charg'd with being against Peace justifie themselves and say no we are not against Peace but are for  a Good Peace  or none So those on the other Side who are for Peace say they are for no Peace but  a Good Peace  also But the Case will lye very much here and indeed only here whether that is not called a Good Peace by one Side which is not called a Good Peace by the other and so we are brought down by both Parties to the great Enquiry which is the Subject of the present Discourse  viz  What is to be understood by a GOOD PEACE  In pursuing this Enquiry impartially it will come of course that we consider the Mistakes which People are naturally led into about this Question and the various Constructions which the Men of this Day are pleased to put upon this Word which Construction varies as Interest Party and Opinion leads them  I shall not spend Time to enquire how it comes to pass that there are at this time such Mistakes and so many Opinions upon so plain a Question and how a Nation so clearsighted as we are comes to see with such differing Views put such a differing Sense upon a Word of such Consequence at such a Time as this For really the unhappy Breach of Parties among us and the Prejudices which constantly attend those PartyDivisions give us but too plain a Method how to account for them And it must be that Men being blinded by their Passions and their Prejudices are deprived of the clear and uninterruped Use of their Judgment give their Opinions with partiality as the several Interests of the Parties they espouse influence their Judgments  To come at a right understanding of what we call  a good Peace  it seems necessary with plainness and freedom to lay down a little Historically the State of the War as it respects  Britain  and her Allies and this I shall do as plainly and briefly as I can  After the Peace of  Reswick  for I shall go back no farther the King of  France  having recognized King  William  settled all the Reunions and surrendred to the Confederates what was agreed to be Surrendred  Europe  had a pleasing Prospect of a happy and a lasting Peace there was but one Event which had any thing in it Fatal or Threatning to the Tranquility of this Part of the World and this was the Death of  Charles  II King of  Spain  without Issue which tho' it was not then happened yet it was probable could not be far off However to prevent the Evil Consequences which such an Event might bring upon  Europe  and as the Preamble to the Treaties of Partition says to  prevent a new War  The Two Kings of  England  and  France  with the StatesGeneral entred into a Convention or Treaty for bringing all the Claims and Pretensions to that Succession to a Ballance this is the so much controverted Treaty called  The Treaty of Partition  in the Preamble to which are  the following Words relating to what I am now treating of  Be it known to all who shall see these Presents That the most Serene and most Mighty Prince  Lewis XIV c  And the most Serene and most Mighty Prince  William III c  And the StatesGeneral  c  Desiring nothing more Heartily than to strengthen by New Engagements the good Intelligence reestablished between them  there is keeping up the Peace they had made  and to prevent by Measures taken in Time the Events that might raise new Wars in  Europe  have to that End  c There's Safety against future Troubles and so he goes on to the Articles of the Partition  Vide  Treaty  Page  After the end of this Transaction  Europe  was in a perfect Tranquility I mean as to Nations for as to Peace at Home God knows we enjoy'd less of it than ever But Heaven healed our needless Breaches by making two real Breaches upon us and finding the Nation Sick and Surfeited with the little Peace we had he visited us with a New War and the Death of the King  The New War began purely on the  French  side who made himself Agressor by  two Steps taken in a direct Contravention to the Solemn Treaties he had made tho' those Treaties were ratify'd and exchang'd in due Form and so fairly executed that  Europe  and especially  England  entirely disarm'd laid by their Fleets and broke their Troops reducing the Establishment of Forces to the Stint or Limitation of a profound Peace  The two Steps  I speak of  which the  French  took to break this Peace were The Owning Declaring and Complimenting the Pretender by the Stile and Titles due to King  William  as King of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  notwithstanding the Article in the Treaty of  Reswick  by which he had before acknowledg'd King  William  The other was the Seizing and Taking Possession of the whole  Spanish  Monarchy by Virtue of a Will or pretended Will of King  Charles  II to the Duke of  Anjou  and declaring the said Duke of  Anjou  King of  Spain c  notwithstanding his Agreement and solemn Ratification of the Treaty of Partition then in Force  These things produced a War as Universal to this Part of  Europe  as ever was engag'd in which has now been carry'd on Nine Year and Months from  May  the  th  to  Octob  the  th  Of the Successes and probable End of which I need not enlarge here it may come to be spoken of again  I must do his most Christian Majesty that Justice as to say I never saw or heard that in all his Manifestoes or Declarations of or concerning this War he ever stoop'd to give many Reasons why he took either of the Steps except only his own Will and Pleasure  viz  That  so he had thought fit to do viz  We have thought fit rather to accept the said Gift of the late King  Charles  to Our said Grandson  c  and we have thought fit to salute the said Prince meaning the Pretender by such and such Titles and the like  But the more his Majesty thought fit to take those unccommon Steps and the less Reason he was pleased to give for them the greater and the juster Reasons they were why the Confedetates should enter again into that War which was the Consequence of it and this is evidently taken hold of in that Sense by the  English  and the  Dutch  in their Respective Declarations of War as follows  Whereas instead of giving the Satisfaction that ought justly to be expected the  French  King has added thereunto  Note that is unto the Seizing the  Spanish  Monarchy  a great Affront and Indignity to US and Our Kingdoms in taking upon him to declare the  Pretended Prince of Wales  King of  England  Scotland  and  Ireland  and has also influenc'd  Spain  to concur in the same Affront and Indignity we find Our Selves obliged for maintaining the Publick Faith for Vindicating the Honour of Our Crown and to prevent the Mischiefs which all  Europe  is threatned with  to declare War  c  I recapitulate these things because from these Foundations will best be inferr'd what ought to be esteem'd by all the Confederates A GOOD PEACE which is bringing it down to the Case before me and of which I shall speak again in its Course  When the King of  France  had  thought fit  as above to take these two Steps  Europe  immediately broke out into a Flame the People of  England  resented in a particular Manner the Affront put upon their King in the King of  France  setting up a Pretender against him after he had solemnly own'd his Title and made Treaties with him as King and Addresses flow'd from all Parts of the Kingdom to the King expressing their Detestation of that Treatment and pressing His Majesty to a War  The other Allies as much resenting the King of  France  's sezing upon the Monarchy of  Spain  and setting up his Grandson  Philip  V prepar'd for War also upon that Account Upon these mutual Grievances was form'd the Treaty call'd the  Grand  Alliance  in which the particular Demands of the Allies without which it is made Unlawful for them on either Hand to make Peace are particularly stipulated with this express Condition also  "That it shall not be lawful to any of the Confederates to treat of Peace with the Enemy without the mutual Assent and Advice of the rest of the Confederates"  And here again you may have a stated Foundation for what we ought to call  a Good Peace  Nor is there in any of these things any feign'd Construction or forc'd Sense by which any one can be led to make the Terms of Peace more or less For this like the Statutes of a Nation is the Rule to go by  To the Law and to the Testimony  was the Word of of Old To the Grand Alliance and to the Declaration of the Reasons of the War is the Word with me and I believe will be so with all Impartial Men in the WorldHere is the Cause of your making War here is your declar'd Resolution when it shall End and 'till when it shall not End and when these Ends are answer'd the Causes the Reason and the Original Motion of the Grand Alliance cease  And here I must touch a very nice Point and which yet I shall do plainly and with Respect I shall be the last Man in  Britain  that shall endeavour to lessen the Duty and Regard  that the People of this Nation ought to pay to the Votes Opinion or Declara  ions of the Parliament which is our  rue Representative and whose Actions are our ownBut speaking in the Language of the Confederacy I say with humble Submission no Vote no Address no declar'd Opinion of the Parliament as to the Terms of the Peace can alter at all the Foundation of the War or bind the rest of the Confederates beyond the Obligations they are under by Virtue of the Al  iances and Stipulations of Confederacy they are already engag'd in  Thus as it is not in the Power of any of the Confederates legally to make Peace or treat of Peace without common Consent  c  So neither is it in the Power of any of the Confederates to impose farther Conditions upon the rest or to say we will not make Peace unless such or such things be obtain'd although those things are not express'd in the said Grand Alliance which is the only obligatory Limitation of Peace and War  To explain my self yet farther with all posible Respect and Regard to the Confederates if any one of the Confederates or the States or Parliament of their Country should Vote or Declare That no Peace should be made with  France  till such or  such Conditions were obtain'd were it putting the whole  Spanish  Monarchy into such or such Hands as they please to name if such Conditions are not express'd in the Grand Alliance I humbly conceive the rest of the Confederates are not oblig'd by that Vote  I come still nearer to the Point for as I hope I say nothing offensive so I need cover it with no Allegory or Similies for I hate DisguisesOur Parliament Voted and Addressed and gave it as their Opinion and her Majesty concurr'd with that Opinion That no Peace could be Safe and Honourable while any Part of the  Spanish  Monarchy remain'd in the Possession of the House of  Bourbon    But if this is neither express'd or imply'd in the said Grand Alliance which is the Compact and the binding Principle of the War I leave it to any impartial Hand to make out how far would these Votes or Addresses be binding upon the rest of the Confederates  This is to me an unanswerable Proof that the  Grand Alliance  is the Test the Foundation to judge of the Condition of the Peace by and whatever Treaty amouns to or gives to us all that is agreed to be demanded by that Treaty may be called A GOOD PEACE tho' it should not come up to the future Opinions of any set of People whatsoever  From the Votes and Addresses of the  British  Parliament I come to the  late Treaty  if it be proper to call it a Treaty of the Preliminaries settled at the  Hague  by Monsieur  Torcy  and the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies  If by these Preliminaries the Confederates push'd  France  to a farther Length than the Treaty of  Grand Alliance  had concerted well and good my Answer is this  If the Confederates thought they had found an Opportunity to gain more of  France  than they had set as the negative Bounds of Peace no Body can blame them especially if they had obtained it I believe every Honest Man wishes with me they had obtain'd it  But I will not say for this  that no Peace on less Conditions than those  Preliminaries  provided within the limits declar'd by the  Grand Alliance  would have been A GOOD PEACE  As to the Objection which some make  viz  That by their insisting on those extraordinary Advantages they lost all the rest and push'd the King of  France  to Extremeties which made him choose to run all Risques rather than comply with them and that they might have had as much as the  Grand Alliance  required and as much as they had pretended to one another to make War for As to this I say they are none of the Objections I am upon nor are they of any Use to the present Purpose  The Question before me is What is the proper Foundation of A GOOD PEACE at this time To which my Answer is as before  The Grand Alliance  is the Test of  a Good Peace  yet as much more as you can I will never be the Complainer But I dare not say that when what is there demanded can be obtain'd you have any just Reason to carry on the War to obtain more at least unless all the Confederates agree to do so for nothing beyond it can be Obligatory upon the whole  It remains then that all which shall be said farther relating to a Peace must be a Comment upon this Text  There is an Event happened since the making that Alliance which in that Alliance there is no Provision made for and which had it been foreseen the Allies no doubt would have made some proper Article to have settled This is the Death of the Emperor and this Accident may give us Room to enquire Whether it does not make some needful Alterations in the Terms on which we are to insist for Peace  My Answer is plain  I wish some People would bear with my plainness  I say it does not And here without Fear or Regard to Power or Parties I shall say some Things which I do believe will startle Man kind a little in this Case at least if we consider the popular Notions which spread among us  We have been push'd on to set up the taking  Spain  from King  Philip  as the REST or Stay of the Confederates as a Thing that we are all ruin'd and undone without and the Parliament Vote Address and Declare their Opinion as before That  no Peace can be Safe or Honourable without it  And yet I must tell you  There is not one Word of Recovering all the  Spanish  Monarchy out of the Hands of the House of  Bourbon  in all the Grand Alliance so that none of the Confederates are under any Obligations to go that particular Length and not make Peace without it  My Argument turns upon this Point then of which this is the Abstract  A Peace may be Honourable if made according to the Tenour of the Grand Alliance  But the Recovering all the  Spanish  Monarchy from the House of  Bourbon  is no part of the Tenour of the Grand Alliance  Therefore a Peace may be Honourable tho' some part of the  Spanish  Monarchy should remain to the House of  Bourbon  If in this way of Arguing I am put to prove the Assumption  viz    That a Peace may be Honourable if made according to the Tenour of the Grand Alliance  I make it out thus The Grand Alliance is a Convention of all the Allies declaring all the Grievances for which they make War and on what Terms only they will make Peace  If all the Reasons inducing the War are answered and all the Demands upon which the War is Declar'd are obtain'd it can be no longer Just to make War when it is no longer Just to make War it is Just we should make Peace and whatsoever is Just in this Case is Honourable  I return to the Grand Alliance  I say  There is not one Word of the Terms of Peace which are mentioned in the Address of the Parliament to be found in the Grand Alliance  The Terms of Peace limitted by the Grand Alliance are these and none but these  An equitable and reasonable Security to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretensions to the  Spanish  Succession  A particular and sufficient Security of the Kingdoms Provinces Dominions  Navigation and Commerce for the Subjects of his Majesty of  Great Britain  and the States General  See for this the Treaty of Grand Alliance entred into by the Three Powers the  Empire England  and  Holland Septemb Articl  and    The Observation therefore is  not mine  nly  it is the Nature of the thing let any  ne tell me how from hence does it appear that we must fight particularly till  ot one Branch of the  Spanish  Monarchy  emain to the House of  Bourbone  or that  ur Peace will be neither Safe nor Honou  able without it  I do farther say and I appeal to the Knowledge of all who were then in the Management of Things That it was in part and in private agreed If the King of  France  had complied with the Evacuating Article as proposed at  Ghertruydenberg  That to save  Europe  the farther Distractions of the War and prevent the Effusion of Blood some small Allotment should have been made to King  Philip  V and this Allotment was in their Eye and according to what appear'd was to be  Scicily Sardinia Corstca c  Now this was part of the  Spanish  Monarchy and  Philip  was of the House of  Bourbon  The Consequence of this must the  be according to the Parliaments Address That they would have made Peace which was neither  Safe nor Honourable  Nor was this all But The Parliament was kept at hand by small Adjournments in order if need were to have th  Necessity of receding from that Vote o  Address or Opinion call it what you will in order to a Peace made appear  These ar  the Things which I say may startle Mankind  Now Gentlemen pray let me ask Doe  the Vote or Opinion of the Parliamen  make the Conditions of a Peace Safe and Honourable Or is it so in the Consequence and by the Nature of the thing it self I desire to pay a just Deference to the Opinion of Parliaments but never against the Reason and Nature of Things  Again the Parliament was to have been desir'd if it had been found necessary to have receded from that VoteWhat would they have said to the Houses Would they have ask'd them to Vote for a Peace which was in their Opinion not  Safe or Honourable  No no they would have alledged That such and such things being agreed it was judg'd both Safe and Honourable and the House must have been desir'd to alter their Opinion  And now Gentlemen let no Man mi  ake me I am not reflecting on the late  inistry in this or on the late Parliament  is what they ought to have done No  dubt as Cases and Things alter the  pinions of Men must alter and Reason  quires that they should alter their Opini  ns let them be Kings Queens Parlia  ents or any Body of Men in the World  This was the Case in the Treaty of Par  tion what pass'd upon that Affair I need  ot repeat But if such a Treaty should yet  e found necessary I make no Question it  hall be yet voted Safe and Honourable all  ther and former Opinions to the contrary  n any wise notwithstanding  I have hinted this because I know our People run away with it That the Parliament having made that Address and given  t as their Opinion That no Peace can be  good  i e  Safe  and  Honourable  but as before that all the  Spanish  Monarchy be taken from the House of  Bourbon  and that therefore this only is the Test of A GOOD PEACE which I think is fairly and I hope modestly too confuted  I have nothing to do in this Discourse with whom this or that Part of the  Spanish  Monarchy should be given to▪ I am upon the General and with all Humble Submission to Parliaments Addresses Answers  That I think it appears with a  Non obstante  to what of that Kind has past  viz  Tha  a Safe and Honourable Peace may be made▪ tho' every Branch of the  Spanish  Monarchy should not be recovered from the House of  Bourbon  This I lay down as my General  I cannot dismiss this Head without observing two Things which being rightly understood will take off all that any one may think in this is reflecting upon the late Parliament  That  as the Case stood then  that Vote was agreeable to the State of Things in the World and to the Prospect the Confederates had before them both of the Possibility of that Conquest and of the Necessity of it  That  as the Case stands now  it is more than probable that same Parliament in the same Interest and with the same Designs would have been of another Opinion  Alteration of Circumstances must for ever be allow'd to be a Reason for Alteration of Opinion in all Cases in the World nor is it any Reproach to the Wisdom or Integrity of that Parliament to say That what might be absolutely necessary then may be otherwise now  I am none of them that leave my Readers to guess at Cases or need that any one should ask  What  are these Alterations of Circumstances which have happened since and which make this Difference or whether and how it is more safe to leave part of the  Spanish  Monarchy in the House of  Bourbon  now than it was before  My Answer is direct  The Revolution which has happened in the House of  Austria  since that time whereby the Imperial Crown' is fallen to the same Person to whom was then allotted the Crown of  Spain  is the Alteration which I speak of and I cannot but believe that according to the Treaty of Partition and according to the receiv'd Opinion of  Europe  for some Ages it would never be judged Safe that the Crown of  Spain  should ever be permitted to be given to the Person of an Emperor any more than of a King of  France  This is an Opinion founded upon all the Principles of Safety which the Princes of  Europe  have acted upon for above Years past  viz    The Balance of Power  which by such a Coalition or Conjunction of Power would be entirely broken and dissolved  Will any Man believe of the last parliament that they would have been of the Opinion to have given the whole  Spanish  Monarchy to the Person of an Emperor of  Germany  Will any man say that no Peace can be  Safe  or  Honourable  but what shall put all the Dominions of the  Spanish  Crown into the Hands of  Charles  VI It is not Dishonourable Account to give of his Imperial Majesty to say it would make him too Great for the rest of  Europe  to be easie under I think I might be allow'd to say the same of the Queen of  England  But I meet with an Objection here which should be spoken to  viz  What is this to the Purpose The Parliaments Vote is not upon  who you shall give it to  but who you shall  take it from  not  who shall  have it but  who shall not  have it To this Cavil  for it is no more  I answer that neither do I say who  should  have it but who  should not  and let this lie for those to Answer to whom it belongs I know the Question is invidious and ensnaring and tho' I could Answer it I believe Effectually and to Satisfaction yet it is not to our Purpose here and for that Reason I wave it  The  Two Negatives  lye before us The House of  Bourbon  must not have it say the Addresses The Nature of the Things says  Now  the Person you would have given it to must not have it  What then will you do with it  And this brings me home to the Original Question What is to be called A GOOD  PEACE As then I have thus stated the Question I shall come to a direct Answer as freely as possible  That  alone  can be A GOOD PEACE where none of the Parties are vested with so much Power as overthrows the Balance of  Europe  That  alone  can be A GOOD PEACE wherein the Great Articles of the Grand Alliance which were the Beginning and are the Foundation of the War are fully answered  In these two Generals are comprised all the Particulars which require any Explanation in this Affair  None of the several Parties are to be vested with so much Power as overthrows the Ballance of  Europe  that this would be the Case of the  Spanish  Monarchy were it united either in the Person of a King of  France  or of an Emperor of  Germany  seems so plain as needs no farther Debate and the Reader is only referr'd for Proof of it  For the First  to the King of  France  For the Second  to King  William  I'll give it you under both their Hands if any Man can quote better Authority he is wellcome    The King of  France His most Christian Majesty very frankly acknowleges for his part That it is  not Safe for Europe  that the Crown of  Spain  should be enjoy'd by the SAME PERSON who is King of  France  this you have in the Proposals of Peace made in his Name and now under Consideration Signed by Monsieur  Mesnager  as follows  That he will freely and  bonâ fide  consent to the takeing of all just and reasonable Measures for hindring that the Crowns of  France  and  Spain  may never be united on the Head of the same Prince His Majesty being perswaded that this Excess of Power would be contrary to the Good and Quiet of  Europe  Vide  the th Proposal    The late King  William His Majesty Declares in the Solemn Treaty between  England Holland  and  France  called  The Second Treaty of Partition  That that Treaty being made for the Good and Safety of  Europe  and to prevent future Wars between the Confdeerates therein named That the Crown of  Sqain  should never come to be enjoy'd by the Person of an Emperor or a King of  France  in these Words  If the most Serene ArchDuke should die without Issue either before or after the Death of the Catholick King the Share which is hereby assigned to him shall come to such Male Child of the Emperor or of the King of the Romans  Except  the King of the Romans  MARK THAT  as his Imperial Majesty shall assign it to but on Condition that the said Part shall never be United nor belong to the Person of him who shall be Emperor or King of the Romans or is become one or the other be it by Succession Will Contract of Marriage Donation Exchange Cession Appeal Rebolt or otherwise as in like manner the said Share of the Serene ArchDuke shall never come or belong to the Person of a Prince that is or shall be King or Dauphine of  France  Thus you have the Royal Authority of both these Crown'd Heads to prove what I have asserted in the First General  That  alone  can be A GOOD PEACE wherein the Great Articles of the Grand Alliance which were the Beginning and are the Foundation of the War are fully answer'd  For Evidence of this we need go no farther than the Grand Alliance it self  The Terms of the Grand Alliance are these    That an Equitable and Reasonable Satisfaction be given to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretension to the  Spanish  Succession  Vide Grand Alliance  Artic    Note here  If the Allies had understood that the whole  Spanish  Monarchy had devolv'd to him as his Right let me ask these Questions  Why is it called SATISFACTION FOR the Succession Why is it not rather said 'Till he be put into POSSESSION of the  Spanish  Monarchy It would certainly have been express'd otherwise if it had been meant He should ever possess it  as Emperor  Why is it call'd his Imperial Majesty's  Pretension to the Succession  and yet put into the Hands of his Brother King  Charles  I must be excus'd making two Remarks upon this Satisfaction for the Succession plainly infers His Imperial Majesty was never understood to be the Person that should succeed It would never else have  been called  Satisfaction for it  This implies an Equivalent with which he was to be satisfied instead of it and plainly acknowledges that the Confederrates never dreamt of making an Emperor of  Germany  to be also King of  Spain  Whereas it is called his Imperial Majesty's Right of Succession why then was it given to King  Charles  It is evident this transferring the Crown by Gift to King  Charles  III at the same time that we exploded King  Charles  II devising it by Gift to King  Philip  was but an odd Title and gave such a Handle to Confirm  K Philip  's Right his Gift being prior to the other as I never yet could see answer'd But waving that which I have formerly insisted on and which is now no more a Question the Emperor being dead This Argument may be drawn from it which I believe can never be answer'd That the Emperor demitted his Right to his Brother because it never could be allow'd tolerable nor so much as to be thought of that ever the Allies would agree an Emperor of  Germany  should have it as the very same Foundation of Exorbitance which they were then declaring and fighting against in the King of  France  The King of  France  then and the Emperor finding that on both Sides the taking the Crown of  Spain  to themselves would  not go down with the rest of  Europe  they respectively put a Third Person in the Place  Philip  and  Charles  and both of them claim the Crown of  Spain  by Gift neither having any real Title  Fate now has decided the Point on one Side for King  Charles  is taken out of the Contention and made EmperorCan he then be King of  Spain  Certainly by any of the former Notions of  Europe  he can never be so receivedWell what is next Have we any other Branch of the House of  Austria  to make a Gift to If we have let us see him if we have not what follows but to make such a Treaty as in which the Balance of  Europe  may be secured and such Powers erected as may reciprocally prevent either the House of  Bourbon  or  Austria  overrunning  Europe  and this I shall call A GOOD PEACE let who will find out the Medium to bring it to pass  The first thing I shall hint from this Obsevation isThis makes me easie and I believe if consider'd would make us all easie on the Subject of a Treaty  Let who will be the Agents let what will be the Proposals the Nature of the thing is such no Party can suggest that we should not have a Regard to  the Balance of Europe  no Peace can be treated on but upon this Foot The establishing some Rule  of Power some Generals for the Boundaries of National Interest such as may limit the Princes of  Europe  and prevent future Encroachments one upon another  For this Reason I cannot but think we should all be willing to come to talk of these thingsCertainly to Treat of them can be of no prejudice nor can I allow it to be a good Argument to say That the  French  always gain upon us by a Treaty This is to call all the Confederates Fools and say they do not know what they would have that they make War for they know not what that they have Generals to fight but no States Men to treat that they have Hands but no Heads and that all  Europe  are not able to maintain their Arguments against Five  French  Men Plenipotentiaries  The  French  make Proposals they would put by the Way of treating by Preliminaries and come to a General Treaty at once And why should we not venture them at a Treaty We can insist upon every thing at a General Treaty as well as at a particular and can stand to all the necessary Points of the Grand Alliance as well there as at another time  The treating brings us not the nearer if  France  does not come up to reasonable Things we are where we were The  War goes on nothing is abated of the Vigour of our Armies or of the needful Preparations the War indeed may influence the Treaty Thus it was at the Treaty of  Westphalia  which held at least Eight Years thus it was at the Treaty of  Nimeguen  which lasted Two Campaigns yet both at last came to a Conclusion and so may this perhaps if it does not we are never the farther off of Victory nor the Enemy ever the nearer the End they aim at  It seems therefore something wonderful to me that People should be allarm'd at a Proposal to treat we may treat without a Peace but we can never have a Peace without treating All that we are allarm'd at hitherto is the Suggestion or Suspicion of a private Treaty to bring it then to an open fair  Publick Treaty  is the most effectually way both to remove the Suspitions of such a Treaty on one Hand and to take away the Pretensions for it on the other  Some alledge a Party among us are against Peace are for perpetuating the War and have their private Ends in view to be pursued at the Publick Expence I am in hopes there are no such People among us however those People opposing a Treaty give the best Argument that those that think so can wish for to support that Allegation it is alledged on the other Hand  That  Clandestine Negotiations  are on Foot and those that say so fill the People with Suspicions and Apprehensions of such Things as I hope are not in any One's Head to attempt  A Treaty  would effectually remove all those Jealousies and clear up the Reputation of both Parties  At a Treaty all the Allies will be present by their Plenipotentiaries every Thing will be fully fairly and openly discuss'd if any Member of the Confederates are easier and willinger to be imposed upon than they ought to be they will be set to Rights in Judgment or overrul'd in Vote by the other if any Member of the Confederacy is more rigid or more backward harder to be satisfied with Reason or forwarder to continue the War than consists with the General Interest he will be reduced to Reason by the Perswasions or overrul'd by the Voices of the other  The  French  are not so considerable an Enemy that we should be afraid to Engage with them any farther in the War or so inconsiderable that we should think it below us  to Treat  a Treaty takes off all Objections tho' they do not propose enough to form  a Good Peace  yet in a Treaty we may bring them to it I can see many Objections against their Proposals indeed but I cannot see one against a Treaty  In a Treaty a Thousand Things may occur and be said that may in the End happily Issue this Great Affair in A GOOD PEACE as I said in the beginning I find every one joining in their desire to have  a good Peace  but how shall they obtain it without a Treaty A Treaty takes it out of the Hands of those you may suspect and puts it into the Hands of the Confederates in General if any Concessions are made to  France  which you are afraid of there they will be discussed there they will be examined the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies on every Side will be watchful that the Distribution of the Dominions be not partial and unequal to one or to another that every one has Justice and that no Advantage be given more on one hand than another The Plenipotentiaries of all the Parties are Arbitrators of every particular Interest respectively  Certainly a Treaty would end all this Strife if the  French  are Sincere in their Offers and in their Proposals for a General Peace it will appear if they are not they will be detected The Securities they will offer will be here disputed the Validity of them determined if they are rejected the Reasons for rejecting them will appear and if we must carry on the War again the Necessity will appear so that  People will be satisfied with it and the more Chearfully bear the Expence Moreover the Scandal of designing to perpetuate the War will be removed and every one will see for themselves why the Treaty broke off and why the War is carryed on If a Peace ensues it is not the less likely to be A GOOD PEACE for having the whole Body of the Confederate Ministers consenting to it and coming into it  I cannot imagine upon what Foot any one can pretend to be backward to a Treaty and I am the freer to put this Notion of mine in here at this length because I think it is the only Method to bring the variety of Opinions now among us to a Point to reconcile us to one another a little and to establish our private Peace by putting an end to the present Disputes among us a Thing every good man wishes for and a Thing none can deny we extreamly want  I cannot but think those People very much mistaken both on one Side or other who oppose a Treaty  some say  a Treaty will be to no Purpose and will but amuse us and all  Europe  that it is plain the Confederates will insist on the Surrendring all the  Spanish  Monarchy to the House of  Austria  and that the  French  will not part with  it and therefore the War must go on till the  French  find themselves in such Circumstances as to be obliged to quit that sweet Morsel to save the rest That a Treaty in the mean time is but amusing us and is a particular Service to the King of  France  as it buoys up his People in hopes of a Peace and urges them to exert their utmost for awhile longer upon a prospect of a speedy Issue of all their Troubles On the other Hand some say a Treaty is design'd only to bring the Confederates into some Confusion about the  Spanish  Monarchy and that some appearing less tenacious on that Head than others will make them Jealous of one another divide them in Opinion and that the  French  have more Room in a Treaty to lay hold of and make Advantages from those Differences and so a Treaty may be a Means to destroy the good Harmony of the Confederates rather than to issue in  a good Peace  As to the First  It seems to have no strength of Reasoning at all in it 'tis begging the Question to say the Confederates will insist upon the evacuating the whole  Spanish  Dominions to the House of  Austria  it is evident as before the Confederates did appear enclin'd at the last Treaty to yield some Point to  France  and to allow King  Philip  to  keep Possession of some part of that Monarchy rather than continue the Desolations of  Europe  and this when there was a distinct Branch of the House of  Austria  to possess the rest it seems probable they may be enclin'd to make larger Concessions now The Consideration of  Europe  's Desolations being as strong as before and the House of  Austria  having now but one Head to receive the rest to which Head there cannot be equal Reason for giving the rest to what there was before and of which Head there may be so many just Fears of the Danger of his possessing itThe Notion then of the Confederates being resolved to insist positively upon the Evacuation of the  Spanish  Monarchy without any Reserve is not well grounded and therefore not a just way of Arguing  As to a Treaty being a Help to  France  as it buoys up the Spirits of his People by so much as he reaps an Advantage by that Momentary Imaginary Aidby so much if it fails will he suffer then in the Despair he will find his People reduc'd to when they shall see those Hopes vanish and that their Miseries are like still to be continued by the Obstinacy of their King in hazarding their Ruine to preserve not themselves  as  France  but the Possession of the whole  Spanish  Monarchy by which they can propose to receive little or no Benefit when it is obtain'd and will be expos'd to the utmost Desolation in the Disappointment  This Digression brings me back to the Notion of the Confederates upon such a Treaty making Concessions to  France  of some Part of the  Spanish  MonarchyAnd this the People who object say cannot consist with A GOOD PEACE  This Point must be clear'd up as we go and therefore I resume it now it is apparent that as before two Accidents make the Circumstances differ  That there was even at the last Treaty an apparent Willingness in the Confederates to have made some Concessions to King  Philip  which nevertheless were thought to be consistent with A GOOD PEACE  That there is not now as there then was a Branch of the House of  Austria  whom there was no Danger to  Europe  in Establishing on the  Spanish  Throne and that therefore farther Concessions perhaps may not only be found consistent with but may be essential to A GOOD PEACE  It needs not that I should embarrass my self here with that ensnaring Party making Question What and how much of the  Spanish  Monarchy may and should upon a Treaty be given to the present Possessor But to keep to the Text  viz  The Explanation of the General Term  A Good Peace  I shall lay down some Heads which without Partiality or Respect to Parties in the least but speaking really and  bona fide  with all possible Indifference seem to me to be natural Deductions from the present State of Affairs in  Europe  and by which if cooly consider'd we may come to understand what is the true and genuine Meaning of the thing we are upon  viz  what we may call A GOOD PEACE  That if on a Treaty  France  should consent entirely to evacuate the  Spanish  Monarchy and the Confederates should give up that Monarchy to the Emperor the Ballance of Power in  Europe  would be entirely destroy'd and therefore such a Conclusion could not be allow'd to be A GOOD PEACE  That altho' some Part  God forbid I should say what part I have nothing to do with that  of the  Spanish  Monarchy should  be conceded to King  Philip  upon a Treaty yet such Parts of it might be also given to the Emperor as might be  an equitable and reasonable Satisfaction to his Imperial Majesty for his Pretensions to the  Spanish  Succession  according to the very Words of the Treaty of the Grand Alliance quoted before  That although some part of the  Spanish  Succession should by a Treaty remain to King  Philip  V yet such fitting Security MAY be given by the King of  France  and by King  Philip  respectively as may be sufficient and Satisfactory to the Queen of  Great Britain  and the States General and their Allies for their Kingdoms and Provinces and for the Navigation and Commerce of their Subjects  That such Treaty as shall end in obtaining such equitable and reasonable Satisfaction to the Empreror and such Security to the rest of the Allies may issue in a Firm Lasting Safe Honourable and GOOD PEACE although some Part of the  Spanish  Monarchy should remain to the present King  Philip  V  This I think may be allow'd according to my Title to be a full and plain Exposition of the Word A GOOD PEACE and may tell us all what we are to understand by it Nor may it be altogether useless to us in helping us to judge calmly and coolly of the Steps that are or shall be taken towards it either by Us or by Our Allies  By this we may determine when these are too forward and yield too much to  France  or those too backward or refractory as not to see when good Terms may be obtain'd both which will prevent the mutual Reproaches which pass now on either Side with so much ill Nature  I know we have some who fill our Ears with Clamours against our Enemies and answer all Arguments with telling us that the King of  France  is sincere in nothing that he designs to keep no Treaty any farther or longer than till he is in a Condition to break itThat he visibly design'd from the beginning to annex the  Spanish  Monarchy to the Kingdom of  France  and does so still and the Consequence of this is by their own Confession That we should neither treat of Security or Evacuation or any Thing else but that our only Safety consists in reducing the King of  France  To what we must reduce him how and when it shall be done and when we shall be allow'd to have reduc'd him enough they do not undertake to determine Indeed these are Gentlemen I cannot join with and I doubt it is such as these that give some People so much Ground to say That there are a Party who are for perpetuating the WarI am as willing to be Sanguine upon the War as any Body and if it were continued should be as willing to be hopeful of SuccessBut to say that the King of  France  cannot put us into such a Case by a Peace as MAY effectually prevent him ever annexing  Spain  to  France  and that this is his avow'd Design in this and in all Treaties is such a Confirmation of what has been all along offer'd by others  viz  that a few Years would make King  Philip  as much a  Spaniard  and  as much  an Enemy to  France  as any King of  Spain  before him that I wonder to hear Men of Sense bring it for an Argument and a Man can hardly refrain telling such Men that they are arguing for our giving up  Spain  to King  Philip  Lewis  XIV has set up  Philip  Duke of  Anjou  upon the  Spanish  Throne and has fought hard to keep him in Possession in Gratitude  and Duty to his Grandfather I doubt not but  Philip  V would on all Occasions do any thing for his Grandfather that lay in his Power but if now after a Peace should be made supposing for Argument sake that Peace were to give  Spain  to King  Philip  let us bring in the King of  France  writing such a Letter as this to his Grandson  Mons My Grandson  I  Have set you up upon the  Spanish Throne  and caused you to be Establish'd in that Kingdoms by all the Confederates in a General Treaty of Peace But as my Design in setting you up was only to annex the Crown of  Spain  to my Kingdom of  France  so I expect that now you will resign all those Dominions to Me and come hither to  Versailles  where you shall be receiv'd with all Paternal Care and Affection  LOUIS  Will any Man say that  Philip  will immediately Obey resign his Crown and Kingdom to the King of  France  tho' he is his Grandfather or had been his immediate Father or were a thousand times nearer if that could be  Would not King  Philip  rather write a submissive Letter to him acknowledging his Favour in preferring him to so great a Dignity and his Kindness in maintaining him therein unto a General Peace professing his Zeal for his Majesty's Interest and his Readiness to hazard himself and all his Kingdoms in his Majesties Service But that he is now so endear'd to his Subjects whose Fidelity has  been so manifest and they are so endear'd to him that he is become the Father of his People▪ and that he hopes his Grandfather will not put him to such an Extremity to quit those Kingdoms and the  Spanish  Nation who have spent so much Blood to keep him in Possession and so in short Excuse himself  that is  make a Decent Refusal  If upon this the King of  France  went about to Invade him Would he not say to him that his  Spanish  Subjects would by no means consent to his Abandoning them  c  and that they are resoly'd to defend themselves and would he not rather fight his Grandfather after all he has done for him than quit his Possession And I am sure you will all say he would be in the right to do soAnd what would be the Consequence of such Fighting but that very King  Philip  joining with the Allies and seeking to them for help against  France  And if this would be so under his Grandfather let any Man tell us what it would probably be in half an Age after to his Elder Brother if he  being King of France  should make such a Demand Would not he  Philip  Laugh at him and bid him do his worst and in both Cases fly to the Confederates  viz  to  England Holland  and to the  Empire  for help  This is so Natural and so unanswerably Just to supposeThat let these People but make it out that this is the King of  France  's Design and that he is only making a Shew of King  Philip  but really resolves to annex  Spain  to the Kingdom of  France  I say let them but make  this good and they have brought on the Stage the strongest Reason that ever was yet given or ever will be why all the  Spanish  Monarchy should be given to King  Philip  and I Challenge them to Answer it if they can  Let any one but ensure the Confederates that the King of  France  will endeavour to annex  Spain  to the Crown of  France  after a Peace I dare say none of the Confederates would scruple leaving King  Philip  upon that ThroneBut this is so wild a Notion that I think it Merits to have no more Notice taken of it  Two things this Discourse tends to To remove that Notion gotten among us that all is Lost and Given up if King  Philip  is not entirely Depos'd and Unking'd and the whole  Spanish  Monarchy taken out of his Hands by the Confederates a thing I must confess however I acquiesce in the Opinion of our Superiors I never saw either Rational to be so strictly limited or possible to be brought to Practise and a thing which those who adher'd to yet tacitly own'd themselves wrong in by keeping the Houses by short Adjournments just at Hand to alter as they saw Occasion To Allarm us and that with great Reason too to Consider Suppose we could take it from King  Philip  What the Danger of giving it now to the same Person to whom we would have given it before will be and Lastly To Convince us all how reasonable it is that the Powers of  Europe  should in general  Congress Meet Treat and Debate of these great Affairs that if possible out of all those Interfering Interests some Happy Medium may be found to Reestablish the Tranquility of  Europe  in a GOOD PEACE  FINIS
