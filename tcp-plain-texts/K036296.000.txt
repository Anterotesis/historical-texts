 THE EXAMINER A SATIRE By ARTHUR MURPHY  Esq  Te Lupe te Muti et Genuinum fregit in illis  PERSEUS  LONDON Printed for J COOTE at the King's Arms in PaternosterRow  MDCCLXI  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE author of the following poem is apprehensive that neither he nor the objects of his satire are of consequence enough to engage attention to so long a piece as he has been drawn into by the nature of his subject but as he has been pestered with defamatory pieces for several months past with ROSCIADS APOLOGIES MURPHYADS MERETRICIADS c c c and as it must be imagined that the men who have miscarried of all these libels have found encouragement from some sorts of readers it is now hoped that they who have afforded leisure for a perusal of the pieces against the present writer will do him the justice to hear him speak for himself He is sorry that he has been obliged to employ his time in this sort of controversy which he despises as a thing illiberal in itself dishonourable to letters and generally the mean subterfuge of those who want to make a livelihood of an author's name but he thought the rancour discharged against him merited a retort not for the mischief it had done but on account of the malignity of the design Excited by this motive he took up the pen and as Mr POPE says of his imitations of Horace he thought an answer upon BOILEAU'S model would be more full and of more dignity than any he could have made in his own person He has only to add that he does not intend to maintain these people by carrying on a paperwar for unless he has some extreme  provocation and that too with more wit than they have hitherto exerted he is determined to look down upon them with a contemptuous silence for the future his writings should they attack them will speak though feebly for themselves and his morals if traduced will falsify their slander and tell each of them aloud to use the words adopted by a noble prelate on a similar occasion  Mentiris Impudentissime  LINCOLNSINN    N B  The Reader will observe that  EXPOSTULATION  stands at the Head of the Poem though changed for another Word in the TitlePage and this must be accounted forThe very Men who provoked the Author to this Piece began to crouch from the Lash as soon as they heard it was hanging over them and to weaken its Effect they immediately advertised a Poem called  The EXPOSTULATION  It was therefore thought proper not to cancel what was then printed off but to prevent the Confusion of two Pieces with the same Name to give the subsequent Poem a new TitlePage and now the Sons of Darkness are welcome to avail themselves of their Design truly worthy of such liberal Men  THE EXPOSTULATION A SATIRE  _WITH thee thou inward spark of vital fire  Who do'st each function and each thought inspire  Who now impell'st me into scenes of strife  Now wiser bid'st me seek the calms of life  With thee my mind now must I converse hold  And all I think and feel shall now be told  Too long my indolence forbore to weed  Thy rankling faults which now have grown to seed  But since at length you've fairly rouz'd my gall  Now hear your own my friend and once for all  To hear thee in thy wild capricious vein  At dulness rail the cause of wit sustain  Discourse of authors and decide their fate  Important master of each learn'd debate  And boldly thunder out thy classic lore  We'd swear above all modern fame you soar  For just expression and conception true  For genius taste and spirit who but you  You one would think in this degen'rate time  Alone shou'd wear the meed of sacred rhyme  And boast so freely all around you deal  No pore to smart at and no nerve to feel  But I who know your very inmost part  Come sit you down and let me wring your heart  Yes I who know which way your folly tends  Who count your vices at my fingers ends  Laugh in my sleeve whene'er so pert and vain  You dogmatise in high  Parnassian  strain  Or when incens'd your neighbours faults you scan  Forget the author and dissect the man  No barrister harrangues with half your spleen  When lords refuse her not Miss F D so keen  But tell me Sir does heav'n thy breast inspire  With emanations of aetherial fire  Does that fine phrenzy in thy bosom roll  Which fires a genius and pervades his soul  To thee propitious have th'  Aonian  maids  Led thy young footsteps to their springs and shades  Know whoe'er fails  Parnassus'  height to climb  And taste the well whence flows immortal rhyme  On wings  Icarian  vain excursions tries  And downward cleaves the unelastic skies  Ranks not with DRYDEN on the rubric row  But crawls with LLOYD among the weeds below  But if advice unheard remonstrance vain  You needs must follow still this idle strain  By fairer methods aim at gen'ral praise  Nor on the thorns of satire graft your bays  With a bold hand bid  Clio  sweep the string  And sound the virtues of a  British  king  Shew him with all his subjects blessings crown'd  In war victorious and in arts renown'd  Tell how the Muses with a gen'rous strife  Rouze at his voice and waken into life  Swell at his word the  Rhine  with  Gallic  blood  And bid thy verse devolve a crimson flood  Sing how the  Indian  near the rising day  Lays down his arms and venerates his sway  What tho'  Apollo  should his aid refuse  You'll shew at least a kind goodnatur'd muse  Perhaps may sell reflect what gain 'twill bring ye  An ounce of incense for a solid guinea  But I you'll say your feeble pow'rs invite  To regions that demand an eagle's flight  A  British  king should have a muse of fire  To sing  Augustus  calls for  Virgil  's lyre  But LLOYD and I who without  Phoebus'  aid  Are doom'd to follow still the rhyming trade  A theme so lofty we can ne'er rehearse  Mere spiderspinners of a cobweb verse  For us 'twere best not tempt forbidden lays  Nothing dishonours like insipid praise  At fulsome panegyrick void of skill  Blush tho' the poet can't the patron will  And thus my mind thus would you hide your spleen  And to malignity give candour's mien  Were it not better mount in Epic bold  And be whate'er  Rome's Querno  was of old  Like him in fustian prove the public sport  And be the rhyming blockhead of a court  Than strive with wit to say the piercing thing  And dart your soul in each envenom'd sting  Hop'st thou to rival  Pope  's immortal page  And smile at folly in a future age  Cast but your eye around you and survey  Books once admir'd now with'ring in decay  Whole poems for their time delightful found  All now transferr'd to grocers by the pound  Verse that could once a lady's toilet grace  'Gainst a dead wall attracts the livried race  Else to  High Holborn  or  Moorfields  consign'd  'Midst other stillborn embryos of the mind  It lies for ages doom'd in silence deep  With  Shirley's Pepin  or  Black Prince  to sleep  Where worms subsist on rhymes once counted terse  And elegantly feed on mouldring verse  But grant your works may share a better fate  And taste or true or false prolong their date  Grant that your foes may all wellnich'd in rhyme  Go down ridiculous to latest time  Yet while you live if mankind hate or fear  What can avail the laurel on your bier  Slow comes if warfare is the author's doom  Slow comes the praise engraven on his tomb  What daemon then inflames your angry fits  Why wage a war with blockheads or with wits  Th' envenom'd shaft they've levell'd at your name  Has the blow reach'd you have they hurt your same  And why then drag them to the public eye  In their obscurity let libels die  LLOYD'S poetry is quietly inurn'd  From dirt 'twas born and is to dirt return'd  Incog  the  Craftsman  vented all his spite  His perish'd essays never saw the light  Th'  Apology  is number'd with the  Dead  Each trunk it decks lie lightly on its head  In peace henceforth may ev'ry scribbling slave  Creep to oblivious slumber in his grave  Yes write who will each blockhead still possess  The liberty or licence of the press  Each modern  Curl  still has his rubric post  And ev'ry press maintains a scribbling host  Hence  England  's navy oft defrauded stands  And the soil loses its manuring hands  Bankrupts in trade their pens that moment dip  As rats will issue from a sinking ship  Each printer perks subscriptions in your face  Proposals croud each diuretic place  And yet no patriot reformation makes  Nor yet whom hunger spares the pressact takes  Writers abound no bard so void of fire  But finds his fools to purchase and admire  You only you remain disgusted still  The fancied regent of the Muses hill  But since on others works you must refine  And trace new blemishes in ev'ry line  Since  Censor  like you judge each writer's wit  Think in your turn to what must you submit  Nought can escape thy strong satyric force  But of yourself how does the world discourse  First LLOYD will cry now estimate your fame  "MURPHY or DURFEY for 'tis all the same"  A line of Mr LLOYD'S  Ev'n he the adverbteacher of a school  To nonsense verse who striplings form'd by rule  Beneath the influence of some fullorb'd moon  Or else inspir'd by  Bacchus'  sprightly boon  Shall a bagwig with a subscription get  And give for ready gold insolvent wit  Then shall the birch thirsting for youthful gore  Stream like a meteor in his hand no more  But at  Bob Derry  's for instruction still  The unfledg'd pupil shall attend his will  There shall he to his circle wisely drunk  Now praise the  Jealous Wife  and now a punk  Then vent his spleen in his malignant fit  Against thy life thy morals and thy wit  His meagre cheek 'midst his nocturnal sport  With envy pale and his lips black with port  Beware he cries of that proud haughty spirit  Who views malignly ev'ry poet's merit  Still fond in letter'd warfare to engage  Some gadfly bites and stings him to a rage  A fool who thinks his notions to dispense  The legislator of all taste and sense  He runs a muck and quite a coxcomb grown  Hates COLMAN'S comedies and likes his own  At bar or senate ne'er approves a speech  And falls asleep tho' CHURCHILL'S self should preach  CHURCHILL a rough unwieldy son of earth  Warm for his friends and foe to other's worth  Inflam'd with malice in invective fierce  A vigorous daylabourer in verse  Who by sharp scandal hopes in wit to sway  As  Hannibal  by vinegar made way  He too shall rouze your writings to revile  And make more desert still the  Desert Isle  He to the world shall tell the horrid story  How  Metastasio  had a fawn before ye  Th' impassion'd tear if  China's Orphan  drew  The plan freshmodell'd the scenes chiefly new  The whole intrepid genius he'll advance  Was plunder'd from the fopperies of  France  His friend the while may alien wit attack  And the wren mount upon an eagle's back  From the  Spectator  safely may purloin  Finedraw each shred and vamp and piece and join  From  Fielding  's page raise contributions due  And classically drunk sing "I love  Sue  "  From bards exploded incidents may glean  Take from  Alsatia  's squire a fainting scene  Spungelike absorb whate'er comes cross his way  'Till  Garrick  squeeze him dry into a play  Then how the shouts of fond applause rebound  Each ancient laurel withers at the sound  He ranks with all whom former ages saw  Congreve  's his brotherstudent of the law  Ye moderns kneel at his thricehonour'd shrine  Worship the author of a work divine  Now a new progeny shall glad our days  A better order of succeeding plays  New manners in high life shall strike our eyes  And from the  Irishman  new bulls arise  By him ingrafted shall the country squire  New shapes and beauties not his own admire  Kneel and adore ye bards This this is He  The great restorer of true comedy  Thus  Io Paean  all his friends shall sing  From lads at school consenting shouts shall ring  Upborne by them he'll soar aloft to fame  But thou a helpless an inglorious name  With not a friend to deck thy brow with bays  Dost thou alas aspire to gen'ral praise  To draw from books in him is great indeed  In such as thee 'tis criminal to read  Seated by party on the Muse's throne  Whate'er he takes by conquest is his own  If e'er he deign to shine in borrow'd lays  For him they'll quote immortal  Homer  's days  But thou presume to imitate a line  No star  Maeonian  on thy head shall shine  Whatever praise with all thy toil and pain  Thou gain'st my friend thou must with envy gain  Declar'd a plagiary proclaim'd aloud  A mere jackdaw in furtive colours proud  Thus do they treat you an auxiliar band  List in their cause and thicken round the land  "To arms to arms" the scribbling legion cries  "Your goosequills seize his reputation dies"  See  Shirley  rushes on devoid of fear  And leads his  Craftsman  and his  Gazetteer  In tenfold brass behold the MURPHYAD rise  Arm'd at all points with ribaldry and lies  See  Grubstreet  opens her ten thousand doors  See  Billingsgate  unsluices all her stores  See essays fables puns assist the fray  Abuse descending from confed'rate SAY  Printer of the GAZETTEER  See authors on all sides desert their dens  New edge their blunted wits and nib their pens  All who in distant  HockleyHole  reside  And they who drink  Fleetditch  thy sable tide  Who in  Moorfields  have scrawl'd a darken'd cell  In the  King'sBench  or in the  Compter  dwell  On  LudgateHill  who bloody murders write  Or pass in  Fleetstreet  supperless the night  The bards who doze around an alehouse fire  Who tipple drams or fatten with entire  Thick as when locusts o'er the land appear  And ruin all the promise of the year  Thick as when pismires crawl along the plain  Or halfstarv'd crows around some ripen'd grain  They sorm their ranks they rail they doom me dead  And the press aims its thunders on my head  Their sooty Naiads you address in vain  Their Naiads sore will madden ev'ry brain  And tell me was it not a crying sin  To represent poor  Shirley  drunk with gin  Why deal on  Churchill  the malicious blow  And hurl him down to grots of mud below  Must you sor ever in new broils engage  Must I still be a victim for your rage  Must still your petulance mankind provoke  Answer me fairly for 'tis past a joke  What can you urge must I then bear you say  To be made still the topic of the day  Still must I hear and never once reply  Teaz'd as I am by all the scribbling fry  Must I not dare resent tormented sore  With  Churchill  's rumbling  Rosciad  o'er and o'er  Shall  Lloyd  with fables and epistles teaze  And dine upon me whensoe'er he please  I never can and let the vermin know it  Bear in the dogdays a reciting poet  A bard who takes a mean clandestine aim  To raise himself and wound another's fame  Or if of open combat not afraid  Calls in his brother bravoes to his aid  On strength of numbers his whole courage grounds  And whom he single dreads with clans surrounds  For me I never form'd a junto yet  Ne'er made a black conspiracy in wit  At other's fortune never heav'd a sigh  Nor view'd a rival with an eunuch's eye  Ne'er sought the silent covert of the night  To steal unseen and stab with coward spite  If e'er provok'd to tempt the letter'd fray  I still like  Ajax  wish'd for open day  And may my name stand ay accurs'd by men  If e'er I hold a dark insidious pen  Ill fare the page tho' all the Nine should join  To point each thought and harmonize the line  Ill fare the page by envy's breath inspir'd  And not with gen'rous emulation fir'd  That anger bears without occasion fit  And quarrels for the vain renown of wit  In an ingenuous mind that plants a sting  Or of young genius hurts the trembling wing  To war with merit that would rather chuse  Than glow with gen'rous rapture for the muse  But shall each mean each vulgar son of earth  My fame attack my morals and my birth  Shall groveling LLOYD deride the AUTHOR SQUIRE  Nor I indignant kindle into fire  Gods shall an upstart grow up into life  A peer's dependant by a strumpet wife  Titles assume free from invective spite  And honour's sons not claim an equal right  Still on my head shall furious  Churchill  's rage  Come inexhausted foaming o'er his page  What crime has made it my unhappy lot  To bear his phrenzy I provok'd him not  When he my enemy avow'd became  Had I e'er stain'd my volume with his name  His bread to injure did I ever strive  Kind heav'n I knew not such a thing alive  His rage announe'd him first as bugs by night  To warn ye of their being stink and bite  And thus attack'd shall I not ward the blow  Not bid defiance to th' insulting foe  Shall I not tell the scurrilous divine  The  Naiads of Fleetditch  inspire his line  Not tell  his pious leer and double chin  That arrogance and venom dwell within  As some huge marble goodly to the sight  Where the blue veins meander and unite  Where nature throws a grace on ev'ry part  And with a casual hand outrivals art  Soon as the workman cleaves it's pond'rous side  And bids the mass in various parts divide  Within the center of th' enormous load  Strange to relate he finds a lurking toad  Is it injustice is it barb'rous skill  With his own arts the murderer to kill  Consider well the matter and you'll find  I only claim what's claim'd by all mankind  The gen'rous freedom to declare my mind  Each reader claims it standing at a stall  Each critic claims it who ne'er reads at all  Who can behold a selfapplauded bard  Whose ev'ry line doth common sense discard  But instant cries "The silly scribbling fool  "Of a brib'd bookseller the venal tool  "Or else the madman shut from pen and ink  "Let him of hellebore deep doses drink"  This will they say and what do I say more  They speak unhurt provok'd I quit the score  Is this the sign of a malignant spirit  That views with envious eye each author's merit  By more deliberate means know envy tends  Saps on unseen and with'ring gains its ends  Hoards her designs ne'er acts the open part  Smiles in your face and stabs you to the heart  "  Marcus  has genius but I never can  "But mourn one thing he's thought a dang'rous man"  Does  Alcibiades  direct the state  Enlighten to the senate a debate  Does he fulfil each part in private life  True to his friends and tender to his wife  Envy grants all yet should a tale be told  "I hope it won't it makes my blood run cold  "Should I relate you'd all in wonder fix  "How with such feelings cruelty can mix"  Thus cautious malice never once speaks out  But nods winks hesitates and hints a doubt  Not so the honest mind from byass free  It courts no object sacred truth but thee  For thee it searches all with stern delight  Brings a right honourable lie to light  Thro' each false medium darts a look severe  And thro' his dignities can eye a peer  Gives things their proper name with freedom brave  A cat's a cat and LLOYD a playhouse slave  In works of wit ne'er lets opinion sway  Nor joins the current fashion of the day  Each piece rejudges by the rules of art  And plays o'er all an  Aristarchus  part  Marks the obscure t' o'erlook can ne'er incline  The lazy harshness of a rugged line  Th' ambitious poverty of sounding phrase  The mediocrity of easy lays  The wornout joke the raillery unfit  The mere rough horseplay of a clumsy wit  With faults like these if the work venal stand  It marks each fault with a proscribing hand  Pronounces sentence with a critic's fire  And leaves the author's faction to admire  Are there who stoop a manager to please  Who if he belches can commend his ease  Around the town who circulate his tales  And take the freedom of the house for vails  Is there a clerk who writes for hire the day  And steals at night to see a virgin play  A bard whose tragedy rejected lies  And each day bathes in tears its parents' eyes  Or else whose Muse nine nights escap'd disgrace  And hates with female spite a rival face  E  n such with other fops the vain the sad  fwits halfbeaux halfparsons and halfmad  Whene'er they please in dread array can sit  The selfimpannell'd jury of the pit  Annoy the play'rs with scorn each scene dismiss  Whistle and catcall roar and chafe and hiss  Rise from th' unfinish'd piece the bard decry  The only culprit that unheard must die  A writ of error should he dare to bring  And fly on  Millar  's or on  Tonson  's wing  Of ev'ry reader he becomes the slave  The standing jest of each buffooning knave  In humble preface he implores in vain  Or lulls with dedication's gentle strain  The poet's judge no soothing arts asswage  As  Jeff'ries  rigid and foulmouth'd as  Page  And must I only then still choak with bile  Shall men be coxcombs nor I dare to smile  Not dare to smile when all around I see  Each garret emptying its full reams on me  On me who heav'n be thank'd have had the skill  To keep at bay the brethren of the quill  Who ne'er with  Shirley  have a pipe enjoy'd  Nor at  Bob Derry  's have got drunk with  Lloyd  Who shun the haunts of each dull scribbling fool  And ne'er with  Churchill  read my works to  Pool  A lady celebrated in a late indecent poem called The MERETRICIAD  My writings hurt them what Sir their success  May envy still grow pale nor know redress  My satire hurts them too misguided men  Who own a wound from such a pow'rless pen  A Muse like mine may serve but never bites  Who without me had known that  Shirley  writes  Yes yes he writes nor has my feeble strain  Congeal'd his sense or petrify'd his vein  Still  Churchill  pours the torrent of his wit  Yet why th' advice I gave was sound and fit  "No more abroad to mend the manners roam  "But know that charity begins at home  "And e'er to plays and play'rs you turn your head  "Attend your function and inter the dead"  This was the counsel this the kind address  And tell me frankly said his Bp less  Whom have I wounded did I e'er with art  Aim at the innocent a poison'd dart  On any honest head did I with skill  A drop of venom from my pen distil  Shew me the man whom real genius fires  Who pants for fame and whom the God inspires  Of right and wrong the bounds who still can find  And boasts the pure recesses of the mind  Who free from envy sees a rising youth  His breast impregnated with gen'rous truth  Fond to oblige desirous to commend  Nor for his talents jealous of a friend  In his own way a rival who can eye  Nor to subvert him helps about a lie  Shew such a man my idol he shall prove  And ev'n with JOHNSON shall divide my love  But should there issue forth a pigmy wight  Still flagrant from the rod who needs must write  Whose hand still tingling from the usher's stroke  Must pen an essay and the Muse provoke  Prate like a CONNOISSEUR of just and fit  Yet want the growth of manhood and of wit  From a friend's genius who his strength derives  As the crab grafted on the medlar thrives  Who thus supported can the merit claim  Ev'n from the stock whence his nutrition came  In selfapplause who can whole hours employ  While his fond eye consents in tears of joy  By works of darkness hopes to rise to day  And  damns  a brief and  pettyfogs  a play  Cabals and plots and wriggles for a name  And shrinks and withers at a rival's fame  Fears lest your industry with him should vie  And seems a friend to be a surer spy  Fond to advise you merely to deceive  And if your work succeeds the first to grieve  Who for his ends mean offices can bear  And fetch and carry letters for a play'r  Who deems a MANAGER a sacred thing  And swears who laughs at him dislikes his king  Far far from me let such his talents boast  And be the GENIUS of an  Evening Post  Farther still farther let  Crispinus  stand  Between us rise whole continents of land  Yet e'er we part his picture I would chuse  Come then and sit  Crispinus  for the Muse  The honest muse whose hand severely kind  Shall crayon forth each feature of thy mind  Her work begins emerging from the strife  Of mingling colours lo he starts to life  Is that  Crispinus  what that uncouth form  Who seems a very monster in a storm  Can he or truth or poesy dispense  That CALIBAN in manners as in sense  In his fierce look what passions scowling lie  The downward head and the assassin's eye  His very youth 'gainst decency rebell'd  From school with early infamy expell'd  Thence cometlike irregular he flew  And as he fled still more eccentric grew  Still he despis'd all order sense and rank  At fairs he cudgell'd and with porters drank  In ev'ry low dexterity he dealt  Broughtonian  fame and judgment  at a b  lt  There is a game among the vulgar called  Pricking at the B  t  At wheelbarrows for apples cogg'd the dice  In ev'ry alehouse gather'd ev'ry vice  'Till wond'rous to relate his race to crown  He sanctify'd his scandal with a gown  Then  Tartufflike  a pulpit he attain'd  With real malice and devotion feign'd  There pious leers a satyr in disguise  And talks of virtue with lascivious eyes  For scanty hire the morning lecture gives  And still a needy  Bacchanalian  lives  His days of folly one continued round  Now at the punchhouse now the skittleground  Now at the billiardroom whole hours he'll sit  Now hiss the foremost critic of the pit  To works obscene now lend th' obscener jest  And to a  Meretriciad  give a zest  To acts of envy all his soul inclin'd  A mere  Thersites  both in form and mind  His pleasure still to join the rabble race  And with low ribaldry each name deface  All worth above him eager to annoy  Mischief his pride and malice all his joy  Ev'n in the church where he should truths impart  He proves a vile apostate in his heart  'Midst the Lord's pray's his spleen a lie can frame  And meditate a murder of your fame  'Midst his devotion against heav'n rebel  And ev'n his very wit can pimp for hell  Can on detraction at the altar plod  "Assist the fiends and tear him from his God"  If such  Crispinus  may he shun my ways  And be his calumny my highest praise  Thee too  Orbilius  thee my just disdain  Rejects thou meanest of th' envenom'd train  To thy green years if nature e'er was kind  Grown old in youth thou'rt now a vanish'd mind  By drams thy faculties dissolv'd away  Of rankling envy thou art left the prey  He knows thy character who sees thy face  Thy look's a libel on the human race  The envious sneer is thine if Genius rise  The ghastly smile when patient merit sighs  Thinking that frets but never tends to use  The pangs of labour nothing that produce  The hypocritic leer the fawning stile  The timid anger and the treach'rous smile  Rancour that lusts each neighbour to abuse  An unperforming pigeonliver'd Muse  The narrow spirit that for pelf can pray  Profusion that can muddle it away  So mean for favours he can humbly sue  So proud when granted can abuse you too  Thus for a job a GENIUS he addrest  An understrapper at his own request  Then at his patron rail'd with ranc'rous heart  And from accomplice play'd th' informer's part  A figure which the loves and joys forsake  Which would each prostitute a vestal make  But that all virtue still to put to flight  He panders schoolboys to the foul delight  Despis'd by rakes sad outcast of the schools  Bullied by cowards a flatt'rer to fools  A mere but more the Muse will not detect  For who can bear a  Maggot  to dissect  Sworn in a laegue when bards like these combine  And rancour is th'  Apollo  of each line  When half wits convenanted seize the bays  And sing alternate one another's praise  From others brows when ev'ry sprig they tear  Vainly they think usurperslike to wear  When their own works for models they display  And this man's poems shew and t'other's play  At this I burst at this my Muse proceeds  Not like the barber whisp'ring to the reeds  But tells aloud and calls the world to hear  Each jealous scribbler wears an ass's ear  But still I'm told why quarrel with these fools  Why indiscreetly wanton with edge tools  Satire's a dang'rous weapon and hath made  Adverse to  Pope  himself the rhyming trade  Let your satyric Muse renounce her pen  Or never dare to tread the stage again  Else shall the  Vandals  storm you from the pit  And with their lungs revenge their want of wit  Must I then stand appall'd by partyzeal  No to a people's judgment I appeal  That people ever generous as brave  From ruffian hands the virgin Muse will save  A play of merit their protection draws  Find but the piece and they will find applause  Faction with all her catcalls shall retire  And envy with'ring by degrees expire  Ev'n each false friend shall shake his head in vain  And feel from wit the pleasure and the pain  But still tho' here the disappointed foe  Sounds a retreat he aims a second blow  Angry be foams he roars with croaking note  "The scenes are patchwork like a  Joseph  's coat  "The whole a motley linsey wolsey piece"  From old and modern  Rome  from  France  and  Greece  Why let 'em say it But shall men expect  To find us scholars then as thieves detect  Shall I see others rifle all the spring  Nor dare a garland for myself to bring  No let me roam thro' each poetic shade  Taste ev'ry fount and visit ev'ry glade  Crop from each antient's brow the fairest flow'rs  And follow Genius to th'  Aonian  bow'rs  Still some small spark of inspiration gain  Or from the Muse or Museinspired train  Ye sacred Nine to whom I lowly bend  To whom my morning orisons ascend  With whom my earliest youth aspir'd to dwell  And sought your visions in each pensive cell  Give me oh give me purer air to breathe  In haunts where poet never cull'd a wreath  Bid unseen images before me roll  And stream the fair ideas on my soul  Or if like  Philip  's son I sight in vain  For some new world's yet unexplor'd domain  Like him then let me make the old my own  Its manners view and leave no tract unknown  Chief let the band who warm'd a happier age  Its manners view and leave no tract unknown  Chief let the band who warm'd a happier age  Who strung the lyre or gave th' historic page  Let them Oh let them teach their sacred lore  And of fair wisdom open all their store  At morn at eve the rapture still impart  And touch with finer sentiment the heart  Embellish virtue give the lash to crimes  And be the moralists of aftertimes  Illustrious race if e'er I court the Muse  Some heav'nly portion of yourselves infuse  Nor let the flow'rs which at your shrine I gain  Transplanted die and curse my barren brain  But round my brow ye sons of lasting praise  With modern ivy twine one sprig of bays  Old  Homer  thus could  Maro  's breast inspire  And thus  Menander  his own  Terence  fire  Moliere  himself the great  Moliere  whose view  Unmask'd each object and look'd nature thro'  In  Plautus'  colours could his pencil dip  And like the bee each various fragrance sip  Seize the true comic each diverting whim  And  Spain  and  Italy  both wrote for him  On antient columns  Johnson  rais'd his name  On borrow'd wings ev'n  Shakespear  soar'd to fame  The manly  Wycherley  lov'd foreign lays  And  Steel  and  Vanbrugh  travell'd for their bays  On their example will I rest my cause  Tho' niggard envy still withold applause  Yes while I live it is my settled plan  Whate'er I read to profit all I can  Tho' dulness sons conjoin'd friend learn to fear  The voice of prudence whispers in my ear  Why dulness sons for ever let the men  Just bubble up and then sink down again  Sooth'em with flatt'ry to oppose is vain  With all my heart I'll sing another strain  Bob Lloyd  in fable equals  La Fontain  Colman  the comic Muse is yours entire  And  Juvenal  must yield to  Churchill  's fire  Flexney  and  Thrush  and  Pottinger  and  Say  The weekly lie the scandal of the day  The lurking foe Bravo my mind proceed  'Tis wond'rous well Bravissimo indeed  But can'st thou sooth them with this artful stile  'Tis deep malignity beneath a smile  This praise that damns will make'em chafe the more  Heav'ns how they now will fret and rave and roar  Hard is at best the fate of all who chuse  For idle fame to meditate the Muse  Tapers light up to lend mankind a ray  And unregarded waste themselves away  Round you more various ills in ambush wait  For you must add severity to fate  Lo from the  PrintingHouse  one darts his pen  And vomits smoke like  Cacus  from his den  St James's Chronicle  alarms the town  And in four columns scandal marches down  But scandal say you soon must droop its head  At morn it flutters and at eve 'tis dead  For boys at school it helps to vamp a kite  Or else emblazes some rejoicing night  To the tale whisper'd or the printed lie  A life well acted is a dread reply  To all the harm a jealous wit can mean  A piece well written is the worst of spleen  It is my mind then let it be your rule  To smile contempt on ev'ry scribbling fool  What smile in silence and with patience bear  Fierce slander's tongue and envy's livid glare  No from the lash be ev'ry witling sore  As for their malice witches died of yore  Alas alas all  Grubstreet  in a rage  Will lay its harpy claws upon your page  Your name each angry bard will still pursue  What can the bravoes of  Parnassus  do  What should I fear an evidence suborn'd  and ev'ry mischief from a poet scorn'd  Who can what can he hush speak out again  Be prudent friend or fairly drop your pen  FINIS
