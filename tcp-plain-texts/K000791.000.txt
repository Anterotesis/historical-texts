in  York  MDCCLXIV  THE GENERAL  IMMORTAL Shade of each immortal Name  That shines recorded in the Lists of  Fame  Not those who from hereditary Light  With the false Glare of borrow'd Beams are bright  But such as Merit with rich Blood combine  Reflecting Honour on a Noble Line  That like the  Phoenix  with peculiar Grace  Unstain'd preserve the Beauties of their Race  If the frail Bustle of this transient State  With immaterial Spirits can have Weight  From those  Aetherial  Mansions where you rest  Starcrown'd in Pomp of virtuous Glory blest  Propitious comean honest Muse inspire  Nerve her weak Winglend  your  heroic Fire  With your undaunted Ardour lead her on  And teach her  Eaglelike  to view the Sun  None but the Bird of JOVE should tempt a Flight  That rushes on a Blaze of cloudless Light  First JUSTICE come with thy impartial Scale  Lest  Prejudice  or  Int'rest  should prevail  Take from  Reflection  ev'ry Power of Thought  Ere that a single Compliment be  bought  Shield  Reason  's Eye with thy protecting Hand  From the dread Influence of PACTOLIAN Sand  Which scatter'd by  Corruption  as she flies  Pretending Patriots choaksor dims their Eyes  Corruption  who as MIDAS could of old  With magic Touch turns any Thing to Gold  Locks up the Senses or inverts their Power  Melting the hardest Heart with DANAE'S Show'r  Nor yet let pois'nous Rage her Venom spit  Satire  run mad is the  Buffoon  of Wit  From whose foul Mouth no Character's secure  That lays the Bastard Vice at any Door  That prays or curses wheedles or knocks down  Urg'd by that powerful Motive  Half a Crown  Wither such  Bays  if any  Bays  can rise  Beneath the Influence of such churlish Skies  Where no mild Gleams of Summer cheer the Plain  But Storms and everlasting Winter reign  Bays  which like  Nightshade  scatter Poison round  Infect the circling Airprofane the Ground  Call forth  Destruction  from her dark Abodes  And with fell Venom swell ten thousand Toads  Honest may CHURCHILL be for ought I know  Some Lines depict him and I wish him so  Let him enjoy his Profit and his Praise  In these so politic and gen'rous Days  Let him successfully pursue his Plan  And prey upon the tend'rest Part of Man  Blushless remorseless and without Control  Plunder  th' immediate Jewel of the Soul  Let him  Humanity  thrown quite aside  Indulge his Spleen his Int'rest or his Pride  Let him in  Scandal  wade thro' Thick and Thin  To praise each  Out  and censure ev'ry  In  Let him to please a Crowd of Knaves and Fools  Paint MONARCHS or their MINISTERS as Tools  Let him still more to prostitute the MUSE  A neighb'ring Nation by the  Lump  abuse  Let him in boundless Rage pronounce the Lot  Of blackest Infamy to ev'ry SCOT  Let him like Humankind's imperial  Caligula  Foe  Wish to behead them at a single Blow  Let him if not content to rail at home  O'er the submissive World's wide Limits roam  Fit to engage a single Foe or Host  Ready to fight a NABOB or a  Ghost  From Clime to Clime Malevolence transfer  Distinguish'd  Nature's Executioner  All this as gracious  Heav'n  in Mercy sends  Plagues to perplex us for peculiar Ends  With Patience will we bearbut let him pause  Nor longer dare in raging  Party  's Cause  Party  of whom it may be justly said  Behold a Monster without Heart or Head  By Madness Av'rice Pride and Jealousy  Ingender'd on the Snakelock'd Sisters three  While Tyrant  Satire  waves her bloody Rod  So oft to trifle with an awful GOD  That GOD whose Service to become a  Wit  The  Rev'rend  BARD most piously hath quit  And why BecauseOh Reason most divine  His narrow Income could not purchase  Wine  That GOD who were he cruel to this Earth  As  Men  to  Men  for Profit are or Mirth  With sportive Thunder would confound the whole  Nor spare e'en mighty CHURCHILL'S  Patriot  Soul  Think not mistaken Bard I am thy Foe  I neither know thee nor can wish to know  Reflected in thy Works thy Mind I view  And grieve to find it of a Sable Hue  Strong Beams of  Genius  gild the STYGIAN Gloom  And  fancy  Webs there in her finest Loom  Expression  well arrays her verbal Band  And  Judgment  leads them with a Master Hand  While JANUSfronted Int'rest slily waves  A flaming Banner to all Party Slaves  Whose gaudy Hieroglyphics catch the Eye  A poor fantastic Shade of  Liberty  This Patchwork Medley blending Right and Wrong  An impious moral soothing sneering Song  That shows the tortur'd  Muse  in various State  Now bred at  Court  now fresh from  Billingsgate  May cheat the Sensible or charm the Rude  May steal or thunder through the Multitude  For my poor Part by various Passions wrought  I praise the Numbers while I damn the Thought  I weep to see such Flights of Golden Darts  With deadly Poison tipp'd to rankle Hearts  And while the lovely Snakelike Verse I scan  Praise crowns the  Bard  while Censure marks the  Man  What has provok'd this unknown Scribe you'll say  This feeble nameless Mushroom of a Day  This unfledg'd Rhimer to attempt a Flight  When such a  Falcon Muse  appears in Sight  What could induce the unimpassion'd Elf  Who wishes me unfeeling as himself  What Motives have arous'd the slumb'ring Drone  Thus to assault me on  Satiric  Throne  ME ME a Monosyllable of Weight  To give a thousand grov'ling Reptiles Fate  Can such a lifeless and insipid Thing  E'er hope to pierce me with his feeble Sting  As well a Bee that hunts the flow'ry Field  Might strive to wound thro' AJAX' sevenfold Shield  Mankind must ridicule so dull an ASS  Who breaks his Hoof against a  Front  of  Brass  Some Waterdrinking Spritefor gen'rous  Wine  Would make a native Blockhead brighter shine  Wine  which he sneers at in his tart Reproof  As turning  poor  Divinity aloof  With my own Weapons dares my pond'rous Rage  A DAVID to GOLIAH on the Stage  Well hast thou pictur'd my unequal Force  But think  that  DAVID check'd the GIANT'S Course  I own thee Proof 'gainst all Attacks of Shame  Plung'd over Head and Ears in SHANNON'S  A River in  Ireland  whose Water is said to bless those dipp'd in it with invincible Assurance  Stream  But hast thou too with great ACHILLES try'd  The mighty Pow'r of STYX'S awful Tide  Is there no Spot wherein to make thee feel  Yes CONSCIENCE will convert thee all to Heel  To please no  Patron  nor to grasp at  Pelf  Slave to no  Party  I oppose myself  Free by my Birth still freer by my Heart  Of injur'd Humankind I take the Part  Boldly I stand 'gainst  Passion  's dang'rous Sway  And with cool  Wisdom  take the Middle Way  Yet not so cold but for my Country's Good  In Danger's Onset I could spill my Blood  Give freely my poor All to aid her Cause  To guard her KING and guarding him her LAWS  With Generosity and Friendship fir'd  Why may not bounteous TEMPLE be admir'd  TEMPLE whose Principles reflected show  The Richness Taste and Elegance of STOWE  Tho' diff'ring Statesmen may explode his Aim  Why may not DEVONSHIRE true Glory claim  Whose steady Temper and whose honest Heart  Are nobly form'd to act a  Patriot  Part  May we not safely honour and commend  In ROCKINGHAM a BRUNSWICK'S faithful Friend  WENTWORTH whose Virtues act without Controul  Not more a Lord in Title than in Soul  WENTWORTH whose Noble Deeds his Mind approve  WENTWORTH whom Men and  Liberty  must Love  Of silverhair'd NEWCASTLE kindly sing  A welldesigning Servant of his KING  Tho' now perhaps o'erpow'r'd with num'rous Years  Unfit to bear a Nation's cumb'rous Cares  Hating like SWIFT a BISHOP for his Place  Can we no Beauties in a DRUMMOND trace  Shall modest  Truth  restrain her honest Tongue  And leave him in the undistinguish'd Throng  A  Prelate  by his  Virtues  dignify'd  Just without Rigour awful without Pride  Pious without enthusiastic Flame  All that sheds Lustre on a sacred Name  Shines Rev'rend YORKcompleat in ev'ry Sense  Religion  's Pride and Boast of  Eloquence  Why should we fear to speak a SAVILE'S  Sir GEORGE  Praise  Whose Merits would adorn the richest Lays  SAVILE whom Wisdom views with doating Eye  Patron of calm and decent  Liberty  SAVILE to  Public Good  alone inclin'd  The Friend of  Britain  and of Humankind  Would it seem Treason or a Lack of Wit  To hail an able Minister in PITT  To say his Counsels gave a Nation Weight  The Thunderbolt of  Eloquence  and State  Reason cries no  Intention  is the Base  On which the Pile of  Praise  or  Shame  we place  Should we reverse the Medal and portray  Those who prevail in Ministerial Sway  Fit to supply with Grace their arduous Parts  Possess'd of shining Talents upright Hearts  Would REASON and BRITANNIA cry out Shame  Branding our Numbers with a venal Name  Let us hope notthe Number is but small  That Councils guide and cannot take in all  This we may say beyond the Reach of Doubt  Some  Honest  and some  Able  must be  out  Thence can we not infer devoid of Sin  None  Honest  or none  Able  that are  in  As does  Religion  Politics afford  More than one Way to serve the  Sov'reign Lord  Poor is that Soul in its own Notions blest  That chusing one strait Path damns all the rest  As by unerring Wisdom we are taught  That the most Perfect are not without Fault  A noble  Emulation  may divide  And  Honesty  be found on ev'ry Side  Shame to  black Scandal or foulfac'd Reproach  Cast at a Man on Foot or in a Coach  The spatt'ring  Bard  whatever his Pretence  Is but a filthy Scavenger of Sense  Great Minds with Pleasure Emulation feel  But meagre  Envy  trips at Virtue's Heel  Let us correct but not with Whips of Steel  Feathers more winningly instruct to feel  One Tickling leads to each defective Part  The other sluicing Blood benumbs the Heart  Oh may the  Muse  debauch'd ne'er prove so loose  To stain herself with  general Abuse  Impartial may she be in  Honour  bold  Nor praise nor censure at the Chink of  Gold  Here for myself I boldly must declare  Against Illnature everlasting War  Whether in  Busy Bodies'  whisp'ring Tales  The carping mean illiberal Fiend prevails  Whether in Friendship's fair Pretences dress'd  She deeply wounds the unsuspecting Breast  Locks up from Poverty a fruitless Store  Of Triumphs in a ruthless Creditor  Whether a venal Weathercock of Time  She spits her Venom or in  Prose  or  Rhime  From me the Serpent never shall escape  Tho' PROTEUSlike she hourly change her Shape  If to  immortal  FAME she points the Way  And she alone may mine with Speed decay  May it go with me to the peaceful Grave  My Tomb declaring to each Fool and Knave  That Views of Profit Pomp or Praise of Men  Could never warp my Heart nor gall my Pen  Yet wherefore should I fondly speak of FAME  Can Lays so humble hope a lasting Name  To PastryCooks and TrunkMakers a Prey  My Works will feel precipitate Decay  While mighty CHURCHILL'S stand erect on high  FAME'S dreadful Gibbet to Futurity  Is there no honest Path to lengthen Life  Must a sequester'd  Muse  engage in Strife  Must she cast off the Coyness of a Maid  Or faster than a Ninedays Wonder fade  Methinks I hear the Voice of FAME reply  Hold I've a darling Object in my Eye  Let wing'd  Imagination  deck her Plumes  And  Virtue  sacrifice her best Perfumes  Let  Honour Conquest Freedom  all combine  To nerve each Thought and animate each Line  A noble Theme shall dignify thy Lays  And the World gladly hang on GRANBY's Praise  Thus Wrenlike couch'd beneath the  Eagle  's Wing  Tower thou may'st aloft and safely sing  While far more tuneful Songsters in their Flight  Wanting such Aid shall sink in endless Night  Proud of the Task unequal to its Weight  With glad Submission I attend my Fate  Dread  War  enthron'd upon thy sanguine Shrine  No Touch of soft Humanity is thine  On a rude Rock amidst a dreary Waste  Is thy unhospitable  Temple  plac'd  Sprung from the impious Bones of murd'rous CAIN  Gorg'd with the Carcasses of Millions slain  Thy  Temple  Desolation's Magazine  An awful savage and terrific Scene  Behold  Ambition  stretching bloodstain'd Hands  Impatient at the rav'ning Portal stands  In vain the  Widow  's Cries the  Orphan  's Tears  Or  Nature  's Groans assault thy callous Ears  Deaf as the Raging of a boundless Wind  That only prostrate Ruin leaves behind  Parent of Horrors which still mark thy Way  Hateful and sick'ning to the Eye of Day  Fit only like fell Monsters of the Wood  To haunt in Deserts and there proul for Blood  Lion  of  Kings  let loose at their Command  To stalk tremendous o'er each ravag'd Land  Death  grimly frowning in nocturnal State  Lowrs on thy Brow Prime Minister of Fate  Whether thou bidst him rush in liquid Streams  Dire Emblems of the Light'ning's sulph'rous Gleams  Or wing'st him in the Steel's Eyepiercing Flash  When trusty Blades in hardy Combat clash  Whether he points the bearded Jav'lin's Blow  Or issues from the Poisonteeming Bow  Whether in artificial Earthquakes borne  While Rocks lament their flinty Entrails torn  He bursts embattled Multitudes on high  Piercing with horrid Roar the trembling Sky  Whether thro' mean Blockade and Famine's Sting  The Brave are conquer'd by this  fleshless King  Th' insatiate Monster still obeys thy Call  And sweeping off Distinction levels all  Teaching this Lesson to o'erswelling Pride  That Dust and Humankind are near ally'd  What says the Miser gloting on his Pelf  The shining Idol more than second Self  Won't all my Store my countless Thousands save  From the cold Comforts of the icy Grave  Shall pennyless Companions share the Ground  Where I am laid with equal Honour crown'd  How cries the Hypocrite with Saintlike Show  Can't my Devotion check this mortal Foe  Can't all the Splendor of my sparkling Eyes  Disarm his Cruelty the  Belle  replies  The Skeleton retorts with hollow Tone  Gold Pow'r and Beauty bend before my Throne  One only Method can subdue my State  Be truly good and I'm no longer great  Second in Pow'r  Captivity  appears  Circled with galling Chains and chilling Fears  More dreadful and more tort'rous to the Brave  Than all the solemn Terrors of the Grave  Sable Affliction's most affecting Goad  Painful Existence Misery's Abode  Bane to each social Feeling of the Heart  PROMETHEAN VULTURE to each vital Part  Whether we view thee in the sunless Caves  Where fell  Inquisitors  immure their Slaves  Wolves of  Religion  crown'd with hellish Flames  Whom bleeding Pity fill'd with Horror names  Whether we find thee at the lab'ring Oar  Sad Monuments of arbitrary Pow'r  Or trace thee to SIBERIA'S dreary Plains  Where painful Solitude with Exile reigns  Exhaustless Fountain of corroding Care  Thee next in Pow'r we find to  Death  and  War  Friends to the dreadful the united Three  Foes to calm Peace and smiling  Liberty  Behold aspiring GAULS in dark Debate  Framing DAEDALIAN  Labyrinths  of State  Fabrics most fair and grateful to the View  Enter not Honesty without a Clue  There vainly Oaths and Treaties plead their Cause  The Faith of Nations and their mutual Laws  Gewgaws of Conscience Rattles of the Brain  Mere Speculation delicate and vain  Far other Motives GALLIC  Bosoms  move  Than the Aetherial Sparks of Patriot Love  A lawless Thirst of Universal Pow'r  Still makes them wish and ready to devour  Nor heed the Means how bloody or how dark  So Laurels spring to deck their  Grand Monarque  Their Principles and Manners brought to View  Behold a skipping fawning faithless Crew  A  Masquerade  where Characters are shown  In ev'ry outside Likeness but their own  A Tribe of Mimes with Feathers trimm'd and Lace▪  Made up of Dancing Chatter and Grimace  As  Parrots  talkative as Peacocks vain  Deceit  and  Folly  's motleycolour'd Train  Such shines the sad Majority of FRANCE  Where  Virtue  's all compriz'd in  Complaisance  Can it be strange that such a Contrast should  Still thirst for BRITISH Wealth and BRITISH Blood  That Slaves themselves they with malignant Eye  Behold and languish for our  Liberty  That like th' arch Fiend to work their subtle Ends  They wish to stab us in the Shape of Friends  Since well they know when open Force prevails  Their Levity must kick up in the Scales  Reason might well expect all this and more  As the sure Product of their Serpent Shore  But for th'  Imperial Eagle  brave and rude  To stain her Glory with Ingratitude  To aim Annoyance at the friendly KING  Who had so lately plum'd her drooping Wing  Staggers Credulity bids Honour haste  And hide his Blushes in some dreary Waste  Since in the Face of wond'ring Heav'n and Men  THERESA GEORGE forgot and DETTINGEN  When lawless Depredations spread Alarms  Which BRITAIN forc'd unwillingly to Arms  When Forts were rais'd in unsuspecting Climes  And harmless Villagers in peaceful Times  Like Sheep were scatter'd o'er a barren Plain  Or by the Tribe of scalping Butchers slain  While Wives dead Husbands welt'ring in their View  First serv'd the Lust of the rapacious Crew  Then gladly sacrific'd their final Breath  So to escape  such  Ministers of Death  Who practis'd in the savage slaught'ring Trade  In Cruelties refin'd their Art display'd  When leagu'd with  Savages  more virtuous far  Than those who plung'd them in the Gulph of War  FRANCE rang'd in Blood whole  Provinces  along  Horrid to tellas merciless as strong  Taught Ruin thro' our  Colonies  to roam  She treated us with Blandishments at home  So Steelribb'd Dames  This Distich alludes to the Mode of Punishment in some Countries where an Iron Machine is dress'd up in the Form of a beautiful Woman with stretch'd out Arms within whose Reach the Criminal being placed he is immediately crush'd to Death  with most alluring Grace  Smile Men to Death and kill with an Embrace  While her back Settlements defenceless lay  To uncheck'd Conquerors an easy Prey  AMERICA neglected wept in Blood  None the  Most Christian  Massacre withstood  Strange to be told yet not more strange than right  Maternal ENGLAND tho' she mourn'd the Sight  Lay totally unnerv'd and slumber'd on  Till Danger proudly dar'd her native Throne  Till flush'd  Monsieurs  with Thousands lin'd each Coast  Invasion with resistless Pow'r their Boast  And may it not be told an AfterAge  May such a Blot ne'er stain historic Page  So much alarm'd the Guardians of our State  That  Foreign  Aid was call'd to baffle Fate  Oh dark Remembrance future Glory's Foil  Brighter to show our Oceanbounded  Isle  The Sons of HESSE and HANOVER tho' brave  Could never BRITAIN'S tott'ring  Freedom  save  On our own  Heroes  must our State rely  Who live to guard it or to fail and die  Some Armaments indeed of gallant Show  Were order'd forth to stop th' aspiring Foe  Some  North  some  South  some  East  some  West  were sail'd  To what Effecteach Expedition fail'd  Ill plann'd or spiritless each warlike Scheme  Melted like Vapour vanish'd like a Dream  Which racks to no Effect the tortur'd Mind  And like the Mountain lab'ring leaves a Mouse behind  At length the  Lion  roaring from his Den  Breath'd his rough Roar so horrible to Men  Rais'd his huge Mane emblaz'd his glaring Eye  Wav'd his fell Tail and foam'd for Liberty  With Fangs and Claws in terrible Array  O'er trembling Nations took his lordly Way  To scourge with Sov'reign Rage each Subject Beast of Prey  To show at large and regularly trace  The Flight of Fireey'd War from Place to Place  Light by the Beams of his allflaming Robe  To traverse the four Quarters of the Globe  To paint each Action or to praise the Brave  That conqu'ring fought on ev'ry Plain or Wave  Thro' each Campaign successively to run  Would want the Force and Fire of ADDISON  Let me content with more contracted View  A  single  COMET'S lucid Path pursue  To show each Article in Order set  Would make this Piece a versify'd  Gazette  Rough GERMAN Names would jar in ev'ry Line  Wound each nice Ear and clog my whole Design  I aim not therefore at minuter Rays  But strive to give the whole collected Blaze  Whence my dull clayform'd Image to inspire  PROMETHEUSlike I'll steal celestial Fire  Come MINDEN made immortal by the Day  When prideswell'd GALLIA'S num'rous Host gave Way  Thou glorious bloodstain'd Theatre of FAME  Which future Ages shall with Transport name  With thee the Aera of our Glory fix  And wond'ring hail the conqu'ring Number SIX  Battalions SIX which firm as ATLAS stood  Against the thund'ring Rage of War's tremendous Flood  Which durst the fiercest Shock of Fate abide  Breast cumb'rous Waves repel the rapid Tide  And smile to see its Foam burst vain on ev'ry Side  Eager to make the glorious Work complete  Burning to catch the fav'ring Smiles of Fate  Leading our Squadrons with impatient Fire  With all the Spirit  Glory  could inspire  With all the Zeal which  Patriot  Bosoms know  Who see and wish to rush upon the Foe  Brave GRANBY charg'ddespising  languid  Rules  War's Pedantry  that genuine Ardor cools  By slow Precision into Practice brought  That knows not when Occasion should be caught  Trembling lest Merit should assume her Place  And leave her ling'ring in the martial Chace  Fortune  with Darts of pois'nous  Envy  stung  Labour'd to blast his Laurels as they sprung  Try'd what she could to stop his conqu'ring Way  And dim the Lustre of that glorious Day  In Frenzy's Rage thus  Victory  upbraids  Hence  British  Slave while I protect CONTADES  Your haughty Masters mock my courted Pow'r  To LOUIS I devote me from this Hour  In Part she triumph'd but each future Field  Taught the reluctant Sorceress to yield  So in translucent Regions of the Sky  When spotless Beams would strike the ravish'd Eye  A momentary Cloud may intervene  And fleeting Vapour dull the lucid Scene  Which cleaving to the Bosom of the Gale  Leaves pure unsully'd Aether to prevail  Celestial Gems again attract the Sight  And sparkling shine with double Lustre bright  Wide is our Field for  Fancy  's vig'rous Wing  Fresh Images in rich Abundance spring  Description teeming with the crouded View  Pants in the Chace and labours to pursue  While pining  Flatt'ry  fill'd with envious Spleen  And wond'ring Grief beholds the copious Scene  Where matchless Tints in genuine Beauty blend  That justly scorn so varnishing a Friend  A Prospect she reluctantly must own  By  simple Truth  to most Advantage shown  What are  Elogiums  on the  Good  and  Wise  Faint Tapers lab'ring to illume the Skies  Revers'd what are they to the  vicious Great  Lights to display the Rottenness of State  We need not straining Panegyric use  A licens'd Freedom of the  Magic  MUSE  To conjure ALEXANDER from his Grave  And mortify his Pride with one  more  brave  We need not bid the mighty JULIUS come  To see a Race of  fresher Laurels  bloom  We need not fawning give  our Theme  to Sight  More stain'd with Blood than SCANDERBEG in Fight  Whose single Arm in one  romantic  Day  So Story says two thousand swept away  Is it impossible to grace Command  Without a  light'ning  Eye or  thund'ring  Hand  True Merit needs no  Foppington  Display  In  Peacock  Plumes of vain  Hyperbole  But like the Gems which light INDOSTAN'S Mines  With native Worth and matchless Radiance shines  To warm the Passions and to wound the Heart  Why should we play the Scenery of Art  Bring to astonish'd Optics from afar  The glitt'ring dreadful Pageantry of  War  Why wound the harrow'd Ear with harsh Alarms  Hoarse Drums shrill Trumpets and the Clink of Arms  Why wake each tender Feeling of the Mind  To weep the selfwrought Woes of Humankind  To swell the sullen Streams of widow'd Eyes  To echo childless Parents' bursting Sighs  Why show the dread Effects of rav'nous Pow'r  Why flame the City or subvert the Tow'r  Why should we give a melting Reader Pain  With Streams of Blood and Mountains of the Slain  Why picture what the  Brave  must weep to see  Those dauntless Agents of  Necessity  Who while each Breast with patriot Ardor glows  For  Justice  fightyet weep o'er dying Foes  Glory  bright Spark of an  Aetherial  Flame  Humanity  and thou art still the same  Megrim'd  Ambition  vainly strives to ape  The Beauties of thy soulenchanting Shape  Yet like the painted Prostitute can gain  Some mad Admirers to adorn her Train  Like her too with the Lures of gay Deceit  The  Cormorants  of  Policy  can cheat  Lead to Destruction's Brinkthen headlong throw  The tow'ring Fools to dreadful Depths below  Not so  thou  treat'st thy votive gallant Swains  Who court with rough Embrace in martial Plains  Who on the Wings of Emulation tow'r  Free from the paltry Views of  Gain  or  Pow'r  Who only shed their own or foreign Blood  To work by noble Means some  gen'ral Good  Who bravely stand against oppressive Ill  And but from Principles of  savingkill  Faithful as chaste PENELOPE to these  Undaunted by the War of Land or Seas  Thy radiant Beams adorn each Hero's Head  A GRANBY living and a WOLFE when dead  A WOLFEmethinks I see the pearly Tear  Stand swelling trembling on its chrystal Sphere  Not so it gush'd but in a rapid Tide  That Day when  our  EPAMINONDAS died  Like Flow'rs o'ercharg'd with Dew you feebly bow  And a deep Sigh remembers gallant HOWE  More sweet than ARABY'S Perfumes must rise  To smiling Heav'n such lovely Sacrifice  The laurell'd Shades receive it in its Flight  While circling Cherubs share their fond Delight  But wherefore droop return to BRITAIN'S Isle  And teach thy momentary Grief to smile  Amidst surviving Sons securely rest  In SAUNDERS MONCKTON HAWKE and GRANBY blest  Nor these alonebut should we speak of  All  Who bravely follow'd at thy arduous Call  Should we at Length recite each sev'ral Name  We must  monopolize  the  List  of FAME  A List from whence expos'd to GALLIC Eyes  Dismay in trembling lifeless Form must rise  Chill their proud Monarch on his tott'ring Throne  And like MEDUSA'S Head convert to Stone  Oft have we heard of Heroes in the Field  Whose Courage forc'd the conquer'd Foe to yield  Gen'rals  and  Men  adorn'd in ev'ry Sense  Save with the virtuous Beam  Benevolence  That Beam divine without whose cheering Ray  The darken'd Soul admits no Gleam of Day  Where is the Merit with rapacious Hand  To conquer but to desolate a Land  To feed his Appetite without Controul  Behold the Beast of Prey rapacious proul  Still  Instinct  justifies his hostile Life  Instinct with  Reason  here at mortal Strife  Shall MAN tho' justly rous'd to  SelfDefence  A rational yet oft a false Pretence  Without a Spark of Mercy in his Heart  Ruthless perform a more than Savage Part  Become to Humankind a lasting Curse  To feed his Avarice and cram his Purse  Not mov'd by Thirst of  Glory  but of  Gain  Such Martial  Usurers  their Rank profane  Yet such have been and someOh Pain to speak  Who more if possible through Honour break  Who farther yet the shining Pelf pursue  And rob the honest Soldiers of their Due  Down Indignationkeep thy Place below  Nor let the Tide of just Resentment flow  Leave with one Wish such Reptiles to their Fate  Despis'd by  Honesty  however great  That of the sordid Crew it may be told  Like CRASSUS they when dead were gorg'd with Gold  From this offensive Prospect let us fly  And haste to one that may delight the Eye  Behold a Portrait of uncommon Charms  To animate and grace the BRITISH Arms  Behold him giving Spirit full Career  Alike untouch'd by Cruelty or Fear  Behold his Breast with virtuous Ardor glow  Behold him conquer and regret the Foe  Behold him from the sanguine Field retir'd  With GLORY in a milder Shape inspir'd  No proud luxurious Bashaw in Command  Behold him cherish with a fost'ring Hand  Behold his honest Heart and lib'ral Purse expand  Behold him hospitable Aid afford  By timely Largess and obliging Word  Behold him with a Parent's tender Eye  View and each practicable Want supply  Behold him Idol of each grateful Heart  Unite the  Gen'ral  's and Protector's Part  While Armies know not whether to commend  And love the Chief the Father or the Friend  Nor stops his Bounty herebehold around  Thro' all Degrees its kind Effects are found  Tow'ring above imperfect Flesh and Blood  It lights on allan  universal Good  So sev'nmouth'd NILUS Source of Plenty reigns  A welltim'd Providence to thirsty Plains  So swell his fertile Streams o'er Mother Earth  So give they Plenty Peace and Gladness Birth  This Portrait tho' imperfect it were Shame  Like an ill Painter to expose and name  Yet should there one so ignorant appear  So much sequester'd from the shining Sphere  As not to know the Likeness we advance  Of ALBION'S Glory and the Dread of FRANCE  To him in Words the HERO we unfold  Such GRANBY is and POMPEY was of old  Thrice happy BRITAIN Empress of the Main  May Ages bless thee with a BRUNSWIC'S Reign  A BRUNSWIC worthy his illustrious Race  Of virtuous Royalty the Pride and Grace  KING of his People's Heartsto Vice a Rod  The undissembling Servant of his GOD  Not more with  Fame  and  public Virtue  fir'd  Than with domestic Harmony inspir'd  Mark Grandeur mark and imitate the Plan  That dignifies the  Monarch  by the  Man  A BRUNSWIC form'd as  Envy  's Self must own  To fix and dignify his native Throne  A BRUNSWIC on whose Glorybeaming Brows  The Crown imperial double Radiance shows  Not such destructive Beams as Flames inspire  And wildly set the groaning World on Fire  But such mild Influence as in temp'rate Skies  The Sun celestial sheds on human Eyes  A BRUNSWIC steady in his Country's Cause  Firm Basis of our  Liberty  and  Laws  Well for the World doth Providence provide  Such Instruments to check Ambition's Pride  As wait the Signal of his Royal Hand  Ready to guard or to revenge his Land  And wisely Pow'r is lodg'd in such a Heart  As cannot even  think  a Tyrant's Part  A Heart that owns no Merit in Success  But as it gives extended Pow'r to bless  That all the Pomp of  Victory  disdains  Unless when breaking proud Ambition's Chains  Then  Royalty  indeed may justly tow'r  Stemming the Tide of Arbitrary Pow'r  Thus mighty GEORGE supports indulgent Sway  While BRITONS gratefully with Pride obey  Hear Nations hear nor envy while we sing  Heav'n's choicest Blessings in a PATRIOT KING  To all who hold BRITANNIA worth their Care  May those who do not ne'er her  Freedom  share  This fervent Pray'r I faithfully propose  May all the Comforts human Nature knows  May all the Smiles of most indulgent Fate  Smooth to our KING th' Anxieties of State  In the still Calm of a contented Soul  May silv'ring Years in long Succession roll  And whenbut why anticipate what  Time  Must bring to pass in each Degree and Clime  May all his Actions  Love  and  Honour  win  Without all  Glory  and all  Peace  within  Religion  's  Ministers  may they be all  Attendant only upon Virtue's Call  By Doctrine and Example mend their Flocks  Nor trade for Livings as the  Jews  for Stocks  May moral Merit make successful Way  And with  internal  gain  external  Pay  That from an easy and sufficient Store  Bless'd in themselves they may assist the Poor  Untouch'd with furious Zeala hateful Name  That takes
