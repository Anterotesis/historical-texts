little SecondHand Smatterers in Criticism will be apt to imagine our Author ought to have wrote  On Taste  rather than  Of Taste  as if  Of  and  On  had two different Significations But Mr  Pope  has declar'd himself in favour of  Of  and thereby clapt a Gag into the Mouths of all Gainsayers His  hoc volo sic jubeo  is sufficient to make any Expression▪ pass for Standard and  stet pro Ratione Voluntas  a  'Tis strange  c This is a vast deal too strange to be true and the Misfortune is every common Observer knows it to be quite otherwise The Miser's Enjoyment consists in hoarding up his Wealth and feasting his Eyes with the Sight thereof Our old Friend  Horace  has assured us of this almost Two Thousand Years ago for he introduces a Man of this Character saying  Populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo  Ipse domi simul ac Nummos contemplor in Arca  a  It is less strange  c This Assertion is equally weak and inconclusive The Prodigal like every Body else lays out his Money in something which he chuses rather than the Money he parts with And tho' perhaps his Taste in Painting Architecture c may not be altogether so exquisite as Mr  Pope  's in Philosophy or Poetry yet still he certainly tastes the Purchase he makes better than the Purchase Money for otherwise he deserves to be begg'd for a Fool for parting with it  b  Not for himself he sees or hears or eats  If this Sentence has any Meaning at all it must certainly be either that he sees or hears or eats for somebody else or that somebody else sees or hears or eats for him As for any Body's seeing or hearing for me I might not perhaps scruple it much but for any Body's eating for me I should humbly beg he would not insist upon it my Stomach would never consent to it  c  Artists must chuse  c I cannot forbear owning our Author perfectly in the right here in allowing the Prodigal Artists to chuse for him when he is incapable of chusing for himself for who in his Wits would not rather employ real Artists in any Affair than a Parcel of Blunderers and Blockheads  d  He buys  He buys Who buys Not the  Miser  I hope his Money is too fast lockt up in his Chest ever to be let loose on any such Occasions Nor the  Prodigal  for he is forc'd to make use of other People's Eyes and Ears to supply some certain Deficiencies in his own Who can it be then Why it must certainly be the Artists mentioned in the preceeding Line But if so why false Grammar And why would not  They buy  have done full as well as  He buys  This I shall leave to be corrected in his next Edition  e  For  Topham Fountain  and  Curio What strange Gentlemen  must these be who cannot go to Market and buy these Things themselves rather than employ others as their Factors and be forc'd to allow Brokerage But the World needs not be inform'd at this Time of Day that few of These are the Produce of this Island How famous soever we may be for modern Improvements in Mechanicks Mathematicks  c  we certainly were never very famous for Antiquities Drawings and Coins  Greece  and  Italy  are well known to be the grand Magazines for all these and whoever has not his present Residence in these Parts must of Necessity purchase the Produce of them from Second or Third Hands  a  Rare Monkish Manuscripts for  Hearne  alone  Poor  Tom Hearne  I dare swear so polite a Genius as Mr  Pope  never once strained his Optick Nerves with poring over one of thy Monkish Manuscripts  Robert of Gloucester  and  Jeffrey of Monmouth  are quite out of his Way and he knows no more of  Florence of Warcester  nor the  Textus Roffensis  than a  Dancing Master  does of  Algebra  or a  Lawyer  's  Clerk of Divinity  But to the Matter in HandI cannot imagine Mr  Hearne  oblig'd to trot round the Kingdom in quest of Manuscripts whereever an old Abbey may have stood or to travel into foreign Countries wherever such Books may have been dispers'd at the Reformation 'Tis enough if he knows the Value of them when they are brought to him and how to oblige the World with them afterwards at a proper Oportunity  b  And Books for  Mead This worthy Gentleman has a vast and valuable Library stor'd with all Sorts of Books Foreign and Domestic and he is not only a Person of extraordinary Learning himself but one of the greatest Patrons and Encouragers of it in this Kingdom However it is not impossible but he may have bought Books from Second and Third Hands and he may very likely have some among so prodigious a Collection which he has hardly deign'd a reading But I hope Mr  Pope  's Works are none of that Number tho' he may well save himself the Trouble even of looking into them for whether Mr  Pope  knows it or no he can read  Homer  and  Statius  nay and  Chaucer  and  Shakespear  in  their Originals without Recourse either to a rhiming Translator or a Modernizer to point him out their MeaningBut  Mead  is not only famous for Books but for several choice Curiosities among which is his celebrated Head of  Homer  for a Copy of which if I mistake not Mr  Pope  has been oblig'd to him to grace his  Odyssey  And the World tells strange Stories if Mr  Pope  be not oblig'd for the best Part of his own Head to some Body else who may not unlikely meet the same Treatment in his next Performance as these have done in This  c  And Rarities for  Sloan Whether Dr  Sloan  has a full Knowledge of the true Value of every individual Rarity in so extraordinary a Collection is what neither Mr  Pope  nor I can tellBut to alledge that he employs others to chuse for him is as much as to say that he is unable to chuse for himself or in other Words that he has not Judgment enough to distinguish a Crocodile from a Rattle Snake Sir  Hans  has purchased Rarities from all known Parts of the GlobeBut must he travel to all these Parts himself to pick them up An Age would not bring that about And between Mr  Pope  and I he has much better Business at Home where he has Wealth enough to purchase whatever valuable Thing is offer'd him and has at this Time the richest private Collection in  Europe  or perhaps in the  Universe  a  Than his fine Wife my Lord or finer Whore  What a spiteful Insinuation is here against the poor Artists that they keep their Whores finer than their Wives I am sorry to hear our Author is a Batchelor or we should see how he would manage in that important Affair of Life He is certainly an Artist for all the World owns him a Rhimer and some perhaps may look upon him as a ReasonerBut these two Faculties do not always go together and if they didHe is not indispensably oblig'd to reason his best on every little Occasion Rhime may sometimes do the Business full as well without it  a  For what has  Virro  painted built and planted  c What pity it is that  Virro  did not consult our Author before he went to work Had he done that I dare vouch all would have been well tho' every Thing appear'd just as it does But for want of this  Unum Necessarium  for want of consulting this universal Genius his Paintings are monstrous his Buildings barbarous his Planting ridiculous and he has no Taste or what's worse an ill one  b  Some  Daemon  whisper'd  "Knights  should have a  Taste" Mr  Pope  has not half the Modesty of this good natur'd  Daemon  who only whisper'd a Secret softly into one Knight's EarHe has proclaim'd it to the World How does he know now but  Squires  and private  Gentlemen  may put in for their respective Shares If so what an Inundation of Taste will then break in upon us The Nation will be over run with it and the Government oblig'd at last to put a Stop to it as a growing Evil  c  Heaven visits with a  Taste the  Wealthy Fool  Our Author I think is generally supposed to be pretty rich and most People allow him to have a Taste at least of somethingNow as Heaven has visited him with a Taste how ought he to bless himself that he is no Fool for if he had he might have had no more Wit than to have fallen to Building or something as bad and thereby wasted his Wealth as simply as some other People  a  That never Coxcomb reach'd Magnificence  When Coxcombs of Quality will employ Fools of Architects they can never reasonably expect to reach Magnificence should they lay out their whole Estates And indeed the Case would be much the same should they take it into their Heads to turn Architects themselves with a Design to save Charges  b  Oft have you hinted to your Brother Peer  c How much had the World been obliged to this noble Lord if he had once generously published that grand Secret to the World which he so oft hinted to his Brother Peer in private ConversationBut if he had others would have been presented with that Experience which they have since purchased at so dear a Rate and this Lord's Buildings would never have been found  Nonpareils  had not some hundreds fallen short of them out of an Ambition of excelling them  c  Good Sense which only is the Gift of Heaven  c This is a much greater Compliment to good Sense than ever one would have expected from Mr  Pope  But the Truth is he has a Mind to set Sense and the Sciences at Variance by shewing that they have not the least Affinity with each other and insinuating that 'tis no great Difficulty for a Man to become an Adept in any of the Seven Sciences tho' he was a Changeling himself and his whole Family had been Fools for fifteen Generations  a  Begin with  Sense c 'Tis somewhat odd that Mr  Pope  should be capable of giving so good Advice to others and mind  it so little himselfWhat a woeful Beginning did he make and how miserably did he blunder between his Miser and ProdigalBut enough of thatI am surpriz'd to find Sense here styl'd the Soul of every Art or Science when there was a strong Insinuation not much above a dozen Lines before that they had very little Business together or in other Words that Sense might without any Detriment to the Sciencies be divorc'd from them and put to a separate Maintenance  * The Seat and Gardens of the Lord Viscount  Cobham  in  Buckinghamshire  a  Cut wide  Views  thro' Mountains  If Ten Thousand Hands were employed in any Work without some good Head to direct them it is no Wonder if they make mad or foolish Work on't But how a Mountain in one Line should dwindle to a Hill in the next without any visible Means surpasses my Comprehension unless it be merely to answer the Measure of the Verse  b  You'll wish your Hill and shelter'd Seat again  Then he  may have it He had a Mountain to remove in the former Line and without doubt he was at the Charge of doing it Now he he has only a Hill to bring back and all is right again and his House in  statu quo  And sure less Charge will bring a Hill Home again than would carry a Mountain Abroad  a  The Wood supports the Plain  I have heard of a Plain supporting a Wood a thousand Times because the Plain was below and the Wood aboveBut how Mr  Pope  's Wood comes to support his Plain I own myself unable to determine unless His was a subterraneous Wood which supported the Plain above as a convenient Number of Columns do a Stately Cupola  b  His bloomy Beds  c  with Silver quiv'ring Rills maeander'd o'er  This is the most mysterious Passage I have lately met with How in the Name of Goodness can Silver quiv'ring Rills maeander Beds o'er Had it been maeander them thro' that is divide them with a winding Stream it had been Sense but  then the next Rhime must have sufferedBut now I recollect these superterraneous Rills were perhaps designed for his subterraneous Wood and as such I shall leave them to perform their Office  a  He finds at last he better likes a Field  That is he finds at last he likes a Field better Where is the Poetry here Where the Majesty of Thought The Sublimity of DictionBut to pass these by and proceed to the Sentiment I can see no Manner of Wonder why a Gentleman in his declining Years should be tired with the Diversions of his Youth when we find it common for most of us to dislike those Things to Day which we doted on but Yesterday  b  His Son's fine Taste an op'ner  Vista  loves  c The Father was of the same Opinion before he died if we may suppose  Villario  and  Sabinus  Relations and believe what has been advanced half a Dozen Lines before But how comes his Son to have a Taste so much finer than his Father The Father planted noble Gardens in his Youth and delighted to walk in the Fields in his  old Age However he had his Choice and might have taken a Turn in his Gardens whenever he had thought fitThe Son to shew a Specimen of his superior Taste makes quick Work grubs up his Father's Woods and converts his thriving Plants to Broomsticks  a  Yet hence the  Poor  are cloth'd  c This would certainly be a fine Reflection were it not design'd for the sake of a Stroke of Satyr in the next Stanza  Villario  is here brought upon the Stage again and accus'd for what every wise and good Man ought to applaud him namely for setting the Poor to Work and rather chusing to have his Money circulate thro' the Neighbourhood than suffer it to lye pil'd up in his Chests and see his Poor Dependants starve for want of Employment  b  Another Age shall see  c This is no more than what has ever been common to all Nations in all the later Ages of the World The Stately Palaces of the  Aegyptian  and  Persian  Monarchs lye now buried under huge Heaps of Dust and Rubbish All  the pleasant Gardens of Ancient  Rome  are long since turn'd to a Wilderness Nay the very situation of several of the most renowned Cities in the World are now become so obscure that Travellers into those Parts cannot agree where they have formerly stoodIn one Word the whole of the Story rests here  Villario  pleas'd himself with Planting and Gardening and by that Means kept his poor Neighbourhood from Want A descendant of his of a different Taste or if Mr  Pope  pleases of a finer Taste may possibly some Ages hence cut down his shady Woods plow up his fine Walks and turn the whole to CornGround again This will also be Employment and Bread for the Neighbourhood whenever it happensAnd whether Mr  Pope  be sensible of it or no Satyr rebounds back upon the Author whenever it is pointed at a wrong Object  a  Where all cry out what Sums are thrown away  c 'Tis somewhat strange that all should conspire with one Voice to blame  Timon  's profuseness in Building and what is stranger still how it came to our Author's Knowledge But perhaps this is only his private Opinion which he has a mind to father upon the Publick Be that as it will any other Extravagance would have produced as ill an Effect and several much worseBut  Timon  has thrown away vast Sums in BuildingThe Publick  certainly gathered up as much as he threw away and this was no more than changing Hands The whole was undoubtedly given to StoneCutters Carvers Statuaries Bricklayers Carpenters Joyners Labourers  c  All the Materials too were undoubtedly the Produce of our own Island except a little foreign Marble and some other Trifles of small Importance So that such a private Expence is so far from being a Publick Loss that the Nation would not be one Farthing the poorer if fifty such Fabricks were erected every ten or a dozen years  a  Who but must laugh the Master  Who but must laugh at our Poet for writing such barbarous English I am really surpriz'd to think how he suffered such an Impropriety to escape him The Truth is  laugh at the Master  would have stretch'd the Verse a Syllable beyond its ordinary Length for which Reason He having more Regard to Sound than Sense chose to omit the Particles  b  A puny Insect shiv'ring at a Breeze  The puny Insect in this Page is declared a Lord in the next and it is undenyable that there may be little Lords as well as great onesEvery one who has the Honour to be acquainted with Mr  Pope  owns him to be a fine tall proper wellshap'd agreeable jolly Gentleman with a Constitution strong enough to enable him to defy Winds and Weather But how he happens here to reflect upon a little Lord meerly for shrinking at a fit of Cold Weather is what I cannot well reconcile either to good Sense or good Manners However if our Author has here confin'd himself to one Day a he assures us it seems a little extraordinary methinks that my  Lord should be taken with a shivering Fit when several of his Visitors were sweating upon a Hot Terras But if he takes in the Compass of several Months 'tis not unlikely but the whole Company might shiver and sweat at different Times of the Year and by that Means keep his Lordship in Countenance  a  A Lake behind improves the keenness of the Northern Wind  'Tis not improbable that the Lake mentioned here may be the same with the Pond or Ocean in the preceeding Page if so it is no great Wonder it should chill the Part of the House adjacent to it which our Author has assured us was the North Side And if the Lake lay on the North Side of the House then the House most certainly stood on the South Side of the Lake  b  On every Side you look behold the Wall  If a Person could behold my Lord's Garden Wall on every Side from any particular Station within 'tis strange how it was capable of containing that Down of a Parterre and that Ocean of a Pond or how that  Brobdignagian  Palace or Town of a House mentioned about half a Score Lines ago could lye adjacent to it  a  Grove nods at Grove each Ally has a Brother  c This is the very first Time I ever heard either a House or Gardens condemned for Regularity Groves Allys  c  are or may be all in their proper Places beautiful and agreeable and why an exact Regularity should make them otherwise is impossible to know The best of all the Gardens as well as Fabricks of ancient Times were perfectly Regular And had Mr  Pope  been the Designer of these I dare almost venture to assert he would either have plann'd them out in a regular Form or every good Judge would have condemn'd his Gothick Fancy  b  The  suff'ring Eye inverted Nature sees  c 'Tis a thousand Pities one of so exquisite a Taste as Mr  Pope  is own'd to be should meet with any Thing disagreeable Trees cut to Statues are held abominable Statues standing too thick detestable A dry Fountain insupportable This indeed ought to have been set a playing to welcome so great a Personage to Lord  Timon  's  Villa  and an unshaded SummerHouse an unpardonable Object  a  And Swallows roost in  Nilus'  dusty Urn  These Printers are some of the most ignorant and withal the most selfconceited Coxcombs breathing One may tell them their Faults Ten Thousand Times over yet still they will go on in a MillHorse Tract and commit the same Blunders afresh For  Swallows roost in  Nilus'  dusty Urn  read  Sparrows nest in  Nilus'  dusty Urn  If the House was a Town a  Brobdignagian  Palace or a labour'd Quarry above Ground as we are told some lines before then nothing could be more fit than  Nilus  's Urn to clap up against one of the Walls for a BirdBottle  b  Just at his Study door he'll bless your Eyes  Here we find my Lord first of all advancing o'er the Green on purpose to expose his Person to viewAnd now we are told that our Eyes must not be blest with the Sight till he appears at his Studydoor  Quere  Whereabouts upon the Green my Lord's Studydoor stands  Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus  a  In Books not Authors curious is my Lord  If Mr  Pope  has thoroughly examined my Lord in  Greek Latin French Italian  or any other Language and found him defective we may safely take his Word for He has already given the World an ample Specimen as well of his profound Skill in Languages as of his extraordinary Candour and Humanity But should the Case prove otherwise and our Author takes my Lord's Ignorance as most of the World do his Learning meerly from Hearsay then he will go a great Way towards the forfeiting so amiable a CharacterIt is not improbable that he may have seen the dated Backs of my Lord's Books and have made no further Observations than that some of them were bound in  Vellum  and others in Pastboard But that is no Argument why my Lord should have looked no more upon the Insides than He who perhaps was not a full half Hour in the Place  b  For  Locke  or  Milton  'tis in vain to look  If my Lord admits neither  Locke  nor  Milton  how can we reasonably expect he should allow Mr  Pope  's Works a Place in his Library and this cannot but be a sensible Mortification to an Author whose Ambition prompts him to cry out with  Aeneas  Quae Regio in Terris nostri non plena Laboris  a  Make the Soul dance upon a Jig  This is a palpable Mistake they are always Minuet or Rigadoon Aires and the Jig is only inserted here to suite the Measure of the Verse  b  And bring all Paradise before your Eye  If by this our Author means either  Moses  's or  Mahomet  's Paradise nothing can be more foreign to his purpose for in the Account of either of them we read not one Word of Silver Bells Musical Quirks Dancing Souls Painted Cielings Sprawling Saints nor gilded Clouds and these make up the whole of Mr  Pope  's Paradise which must certainly be a new one different from both the other  Ignotusque locus Graiis simul atque Latinis  a  A Hundred Footsteps scrape the Marble Hall  Our Author it seems was admitted among a vast Croud to a magnificent Entertainment How well he requited his Benefactor we shall see afterwards  b  Is this a Dinner  No I'll be sworn nor nothing like One as it has been hitherto describ'd We have heard of nothing yet but  Serpents  gracing the Buffet and  Tritons  spewing out Water and then he calls outIs this a DinnerHowever I am affraid he cries out before he has Occasion  c  So quick retires each flying Course  c Now we come to a Dinner in good Earnest but our Author very justly complains of their taking all his Victuals from before him out of an Excess of Complaisance which indeed was intollerable to one so sharp set Howbeit if ever he should have the Honour to be admitted to my Lord's Table again I would advise him to copy after his Brother  Durfey's  bright Example and take a Hammer and a Tenpenny Nail in his Pocket to fix the first good Plate full of Meat he lays his Hands on fast to the Table  a  And complaisantly help'd to all I hate  I wonder how my Lord's Servants came to know his Palate so exquisitely well as to help him to nothing but what he hatedAnd yet what's strange he complain'd but a few Lines before that the Courses were taken too soon awayIf we hate every Dish upon a Table the sooner they are remov'd the betterBut he seems resolv'd not to be satisfied and therefore I am really of Opinion his best Way would have been to have din'd at Home and paid my Lord a Visit afterwardsHe would hardly have been chid for coming so late  b  And swear no Day was ever past so ill  So my Lord swears too I dare affirm if all the rest of his Guests were of his Stamp But if the rest were of a different Disposition 'tis not unlikely but Mr  Pope  might pass unobserv'd in the Croud and that may be one grand Cause of his Uneasiness  a  You show us  Rome  was glorious not profuse  And pompous Buildings once were things of use  The  Roman  Buildings were undoubtedly the most expensive upon Earth but at the same time they were the least useful whatever Mr  Pope  may alledge to the contraryTheir most noted Structures were their  Circi  for Horse and Chariot Races  Amphitheatres  for Combats with  Gladiators  and wild Beasts  Theatres  for Scenical Diversions  Naumachiae  for Naval Exercises  Baths Temples Triumphal Arches Monumental Pillars Pyramids  c All these were built in the most sumptuous and stately Manner possible and it is well known that some of them were of little Use to the Republick some of no Use and others of vast Detriment as their own Writers allow  b  Just as they are yet shall your noble Rules  c This as it stands is downright Nonsense  Yet shall your noble Rules just as they are fill half the Land  c that is your noble Rules such as they are good or bad rough as they run shall fillThis I dare say is none of your Meaning The Truth is your Design was to have been understood in a Sense very different from what the Expressions will bear Your Aim was to have said Yet shall your noble Rules as just as they are fill  c  This would have been Sense and something to your Purpose but then it would have stretch'd your Verse out a Syllable too long and you rather chose to transgress against Sense than Sound However for once I will help you to an Expression which shall suite you exactly  Just tho' they be yet shall  c  Yet shall your noble RulesFill half the Land with Imitating Fools  Better by half were it for the Land that my Lord's Rules how just soever had never been published than they should add such vast Numbers to the Stock of Fools we have alreadyHowever I hope my Lord had no such Design in the Publication but what he did was out of a generous Principle of serving his Country and not with any sinister View of raising himself a Name by making half the Nation appear ridiculous  a  Proud to catch Cold at a  Venetian  door  If either a  Roman  or a  Gothic  Door would exempt the Master of the House from catching Cold no  Venetian  Door should ever find a Place round my MansionIf otherwise I cannot imagine what Business the  Venetian Door  has here since the Wind's roaring thro' long Arcades would cause a Man to catch Cold at a Door of any other Form every whit as soon  a  Yet thou proceed be fallen Arts thy care  This Verse is Lame and wants a Crutch However I shall overlook it as only a Printer's Error  Be the fallen Arts thy care  is the true reading  b  And Temples worthier of the God  To talk of a Temple worthy of a God is unworthy any Man of Sense Whether such an Idea will go down in Poetry I know not I am sure it will never do either in Philosophy or Divinity▪ Why should one Temple be worthier of an omnipresent Being than another Why should a large Temple suite him better than a small One A Marble Fabrick than one of Free Stone or that than one of Brick or Timber Solomon has assured us long enough ago that  God dwells not in Houses made with Hands  And tho' the  Pagans  were taught that their Local Dieties might he confin'd within certain Limits yet the wiser Sort among them condemn'd the Notion and  Christianity  has not only set us free from that but a Thousand other Fopperies so that whoever advances such Doctrine at this Time of the Day is making a fresh Attempt to put a Hook in our Noses and a Bridle in our Lips to draw us back to  Paganism  or which is much the same to  Popery  APPENDIX  THUS have I given my Readers a few plain Remarks upon Mr  Pope  's last doughty Performance I shall now add Mr  Congreve  's Epistle to the Lord Viscount  Cobham  on a Subject not much different whereby the World will easily perceive that this Work falls as far short of Mr  Congreve's  as his Ode on  Music  did of Mr  Dryden  's His  Pastorals  of Mr  Philips  's His  Windsor Forest  of Sir  John Denham Cooper  's  Hill  His first Book of  Homer  of that done by Mr  Tickell  or his  Dunciad  of the  Dispensary  But what is most surprizing Mr  Pope  has not once named nor so much as hinted at his Patron's polite Taste so well known to all  Mankind  Numb I OF RETIREMENT AND TASTE  An EPISTLE to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount COBHAM  By Mr CONGREVE  SINCEREST Critic of my Prose or Rhime  Tell how thy pleasing STOWE employs thy Time  Say COBHAM what amuses thy Retreat  Or Stratagems of War or Schemes of State  Dost thou recall to Mind with Joy or Grief  Great  MARLBRO  's Actions That immortal  Chief  Whose slightest Trophy rais'd in each Campaign  More than suffic'd to signalize a Reign  Does thy Remembrance rising warm thy Heart  With Glory past where Thou thy self hadst Part  Or dost thou grieve indignant now to see  The fruitless End of all thy Victory  To see th'Audacious Foe so late subdu'd  Dispute those Terms for which so long they su'd  As if BRITANNIA now were sunk so low  To beg that PEACE she wonted to bestow  Be far that Guilt be never known that Shame  That ENGLAND shou'd retract her  righful Claim  Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd  Stain with her Pen the Lustre of her Sword  Or dost thou give the Winds afar to blow  Each vexingThought and Heartdevouring Woe  And fix thy Mind alone on rural Scenes  To turn the level'd Lawns to liquid Plains  To raise the creeping Rills from humble Beds  And force the latent Springs to lift their Heads  On watry Colums Capitals to rear  That mix their flowing Curls with upper Air  Or dost Thou weary grown these Works neglect  No Temples Statues Obelisks erect  But catch the morning Breeze from fragrant Meads  Or shun the Noontide Ray in wholesome Shades  Or slowly walk along the mazy Wood  To meditate on all that's wise and good  For Nature bountiful in Thee has join'd  A Person pleasing with a worthy Mind  Not given thee Form alone but Means and Art  To draw the Eye or to allure the Heart  Poor were the Praise in Fortune to excel  Yet want the Way to use that Fortune well  While thus adorn'd while thus with Virtue crown'd  At Home in Peace Abroad in Arms renown'd  Graceful in Form and winning in Address  While well you think what aptly you express  With Health with Honour with a fair Estate  A Table free and elegantly neat  What can be added more to mortal Bliss  What can he want that stands possest of This  What can the fondest wishing Mother more  Of Heaven attentive for her Son implore  And yet a  Happiness  remains  unknown  Or to  Philosophy  reveal'd  alone  A  Precept  which unpractis'd renders vain  Thy flowing Hopes and Pleasure turns to Pain  Shou'd Hope and Fear thy Heart alternate tear  Or Love or Hate or Rage or anxious Care  Whatever Passions may thy Mind infest  Where is that Mind which Passions ne'er molest  Amidst the Pangs of such intestine Strife  Still  think the  PRESENT DAY  the  LAST  of  LIFE  Defer not till  ToMorrow  to be  Wise  ToMorrow  's SUN to  Thee  may never  rise  Or shou'd  ToMorrow  chance to cheer thy  Sight  With her enliv'ning and unlook'dfor  Light  How grateful will appear her  dawning Rays  As Favours unexpected doubly please  Who thus can think and who such Thoughts pursues  Content may keep his Life or calmly lose  All Proofs of this Thou may'st thyself receive  When Leisure from Affairs will give thee Leave  Come see thy Friend retir'd without Regret  Forgetting Care or striving to forget  In easy Contemplation soothing Time  With Morals much and now and then with Rhime  Not so robust in Body as in Mind  And always undejected tho' declin'd  Not wond'ring at the World's new wicked Ways  Compar'd with those of our Forefathers Days  For Virtue now is neither more nor less  And Vice is only varied in the Dress  Believe it  Men  have always been the same  And OVID's  Golden Age  is but a Dream  Numb II  To the AUTHOR  Demitte auriculas at iniquae mentis Asellus  Cum gravius dorso subit onus  Hor  SIR  IF we will look a little into the Conduct and Custom of the World it may not appear so extraordinary as some have thought it that Mr  Pope  because he cannot be the  Fountain of Honour  to Mankind should be fond of usurping the  Fountain of Infamy  and please himself with dealing out a Fund of  dirty  Promotions from that  inexhaustible  Spring And as nothing yields a more sincere Delight than to see the Workings of a  beneficent  Mind I doubt not but every  good  Man is rejoiced to observe this  Great Prince  creating  Dunces  upon  Dunces  of his own free Will and Motion with so much Alacrity and all in a due Subordination It is  certain I ought to be very well satisfied with my Share of  Honours  in this Kingdom of  Dulness  since the Preamble to my Patent is That  He could not find One more fit to wear them  I would not willingly act like the Favourite whom  Shakespeare  somewhere describes who being made proud by his Prince advanced his Pride against the Power that bred it But I would rather like a grateful Favourite lay out my Talents in asserting the Legality of my Master's Title to those Dominions in which he exercises so free a Sway and from whence he so unsparingly dispenses his  Promotions  And since I have mention'd  Shakespeare  one of the Tributaries by Conquest made subservient to his Throne I will attempt to convince Unbelievers by some few Instances of his  Prowess  with what a Strength of Arm and Fineness of Head he has  humbled  that proud Adversary to his Sceptre Or to step out of all  Metaphor  at once I will attempt to shew with what Fidelity he has perform'd the  dull  Office of an  Editor  hardly without aiming to understand his Author himself or having any Ambition that his Readers ever should Or where he does aim to shew he has such a happy Fatality at Mistaking that we are to wish he would not explain the Author into  Nonsense  Give me Leave to subjoin some Examples just as they occur to my Observation  I Much ado about Nothing Act Scene  Sometimes fashioning them like  Pharoah  's Soldiers▪  in the  reechy  Painting sometimes like the God  Bel  's Priests in the old ChurchWindow c  Mr  Pope  is pleas'd to tell us that  reechie  signifies  valuable  But the Poet had no Intention here of complimenting the Richness or Value of the Painting On the other Hand he would speak despieably of it as of a common  WallPainting  as he does in another Play of the Story of the  Prodigal  and the  German  hunting in  WaterWork  We may be pretty sure therefore our Author wrote  the  reechy  Painting  i e Smokedry'd exposed to Weather or reeking and steaming with Nastiness There are two other Passages where I remember this Word again occurrs in our Author  Coriolanus Act Scene  The KitchenMaukin pins  Her richest Lockram 'bout her  reechy Neck  c  And Hamlet Act Scene  And let him for a Pair of  reechy  Kisses  Or padling in your Neck c  Now if  reechy  in either of these Passages signifies  valuable  I shall be content to allow Mr  Pope  's Gloss upon the Passage first quoted  II Henry VIII Act Scene  One sare that promises no  Element  In such a Business  Here we are told that  Element  is  Rudiment  or  Beginning  But here again the common Sense of the Passage is explain'd away  Shakespeare  means no more than that He is One who  promises no  Qualifications  no  Talents  for such a Business or is not in a  Sphere  for it In these Acceptations I think our Poet generally uses the Phrase So  Merry Wives of Windsor Act Scene  And such Dawbry as this is beyond our  Element  TwelfthNight Act Scene  What you would is out of my Welkin I might say  Element  but the Word is overworn  And again Act Scene  You are idle shallow Things I am not of your  Element  In every one of which Quotations Mr  Pope's  Gloss would be out of the Way It were not amiss perhaps that this Commentator should remember  A Man may sometimes be out of his  Element  III King Lear Act Scene  Crack Nature's Mould all  All Relations or kindred Elements that compose Man as Mr  Pope  expounds it But with Submission the Text must first be slightly amended and we shall easily come at a better Explication Read  all  Germins  spill at once  c  i e  Germina  Seeds of Matter  So again in  Mackbeth Act Scene  tho' the Treasure  Germains  spill at once  That make ingrateful Man  Of Nature's  Germins  tumble all together  Ev'n 'till Destruction sicken  For so it must here like wise be corrected And to put this Emendation beyond all Doubt I will produce one more Passage where our Author not only uses the same Thought again but the Word that ascertains my Explication into the Bargain  Winter's Tale Act Scene  Let Nature crush the Sides o'th'Earth together  And marr the  Seeds  within  IV King Lear Act Scene  wherefore should I  Stand in the Plague of Custom and permit  The  Nicety  of Nations to deprive me  c  I would very willingly know as Mr  Pope  declares against his having made any  Innovations  from what Authority he has adopted this quaint Word  Nicety  It is in none of the Old Copies that ever I have seen and if he derives it either from Mr  Row  's Edition or Mr  Tate  's Alteration of this Play he must give me Leave to except against it The Old Reading which I presume Mr  Pope  did not know what to make of 'tis true is corrupted  The  Curiosity  of Nations  but out of it I will venture to restore the Poet's genuine Word  The  Courtesy  of Nations to deprive me  c  Our accurate  Editor  might have observ'd that his Author chuses the very Term upon the like Occasion in another of his Plays  As you like it  Act Scene  The  Courtesy  of Nations allows you my better in that you are the  firstborn  So in another Place he substitutes it for Birthright  Cymbelyne  Act Scene  aye hopeless  To have the  Courtesy  your Cradle promis'd  And for the more vulgar Use of the Phrase I do not doubt but Mr  Pope  may have heard that certain Lands and Honours are held by the  Courtesy  of  England  V Measure for Measure Act Scene  say to thyself  From their abominable and beastly Touches  I drink I eat  away  myself and live  This is a very excellent Instance of our Editor's  Sagacity  and I wish heartily he would have obliged us with his physical Solution how a Man may  eat away  himself and  live  Till he does this I would crave Leave to substitute by Conjecture  say to thyself  By their abominable and beastly Touches  I drink I eat  array  myself and live  i e  I feed myself and put Cloaths on my Back by exercising the vile Trade of a Bawd  VI TwelfthNight Act Scene  Sir Andr  O had I but follow'd the Arts  Sir Tob  Then hadst thou had an excellent Head of Hair  Sir Andr  Why would that have mended my Hair  Sir Tob  Past Question for thou seest it will not  cool my  Nature  Prodigious SagacityThe Dialogue is of a very light Strain here betwixt two foolish Knights but I would be very glad to know methinks why Sir  Andrew  's Hair hanging  lank  should or should not  cool  Sir  Toby  's Nature Till I can be informed in this Point I fancy we may make Sense of it thus  Sir Andr  Why should that have mended my Hair  Sir Tob  Past Question for thou seest it will not  curl by  Nature  VII Love's Labour Lost Act Scene  This  Signior  Junio giant dwarf Dan  Cupid  Some Readers 'tis probable would have been glad to know why the Poets call  Cupid  Signior  Junio  Has it an Allusion to any old Tale or to any Charactar in any old Play No such Thing As there is a Contrast of Terms in  GiantDwarf  so I have a great Suspicion there should be in these other Words if we could retrieve the true Reading And why might it not have been  This  Seniorjunior  giantDwarf Dan  Cupid  i e  this Old Young Man I am sure there is a Description afterwards of him in this very Play which will be no bad Confirmation of this Conjecture  That was the way to make his Godhead wax  For he hath been  Five thousand Years  a  Boy  VIII Ibid Act Scene  And why indeed  Naso  but for smelling out the odoriferous Flowers of Fancy The Jerks  of Invention  imitary  is Nothing So doth the Hound his Master  c  Sagacity with a Vengeance What Neither osund Sense true Grammar right Inserence Pointing or MeaningThen what is  Invention imitary  Invention and Imitation are certainly two distinct Things In short is Mr  Pope  won't merrily call it  pidling  I will venture to give Light to this very difficult Passage The Speech is by a Pedant who frequently throws in a Word of  Latin  amongst his  English  and he is here flourishing upon the Merit of Invention beyond that of Imitation or copying after another Correct it thus and all is plain and intelligible  And why indeed  Naso  but for smelling out the odoriserous Flowers of Fancy the Jerks of Invention  imitari  is nothing so doth the Hound his Mlaster  c  imitari  i e  to imitate copy  or  follow after  IX Titus Andronicus Act Scene  Which of your Hands hath not defended  Rome  And rear'd alost the bloody BattleAx  Writing Destruction on the Enemies  Castle  Sagacity again unless Mr  Pope  means an Improvement of the  Art Military  by teaching us that it was ever a Custom to hew down Castles with a BattleAx Or how if he should have a Mind to tell us that they wore  Castles  formerly upon their Heads for  defensive  Armour There is indeed a Passage in  Troilus  and  Cressida  which such a Commentator might take in such a Sense  And  Diomede  Stand fast and wear a  Castle  on thy Head  c But as I cannot come in to this Interpretation I shall venture to read the Passage in  Andronicus  thus  Writing Destruction on the Enemies  Caske  A broken  k  in the Manuscript might be mistaken for a  tl  and thus a Castle was built at once But I think it would be something easier to split an  Helmet  with a BattleAx than cut down a  Castle  and that is one Reason which induces me to propose this Reading  I had design'd to throw in another Emendation upon the Word  Castle  but I have already transgress'd the Limits of a Letter and there are two or three Topicks still behind that I have an Occasion to touch upon  Mr  Pope  's DUNCIAD having lately made its Appearance in so pompous a Shape with  Notes variorum  I am sorry the Editor could not spare us this short Scrap in a  single  Language I am very well content to pass over the  Slander  of his  Wit  but ought not as I apprehend to rest Silent under  that  of his  Malice  in which he would fix a pretended Charge of Ingratitude upon Me a Vice I hope of all others the least ingrasted in my Nature This Charge is  That during the Space of two Years while Mr  Pope  was preparing his Edition of  Shakespeare  I who had then some Correspondence with him and was solliciting Favours by Letters did wholly conceal  my Design upon that Author till after his Publication  To one Part of this Accusation I have reply'd in a former Letter in this  Paper  To say I concealed my Design is a slight Mistake for I had no such certain Design till I saw how  incorrect  an Edition Mr  Pope  had given the Publick To the other Part I think I dare securely charge my Memory with all the  Favours  that ever I ventur'd to ask of Mr  Pope  and I challenge him to produce my Letters against me if he thinks there is any Room for it The first Favour that I ask'd was when I introduced a Play upon the Stage that he would assist me in a few Tickets towards my Benefit In about a Month after this Request I received my Packet back with this civil Excuse That he had been all the while from home and had not my Parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it This I confess induced me when I put out my Proposals for  Aeschylus  to sollicit Mr  Pope  for this  Second Favour  that he would please to recommend  that  my  Design  if it did not interfere with his own Affair of the  Odyssey  To this Mr  Pope  reply'd by Letter  That  he was glad I had undertaken this Work and should be as glad to promote my Interest notwithstanding his own Subscription to the  Odyssey  That his own Awkwardness and indeed Inability of solliciting in any Kind made him quite useless  to his own Interest but that he might not be intirely so to mine he would ask those of his Friends for me with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing  But from that Day to the Publication of my  Shakespeare Restored  an Interval of above Two Years I never received one Line more from Mr  Pope  no Intimation of  one  Subscriber by his Interest not even an Order that I should put his  own  Name down in my List Upon this naked Fact I submit the Censure both of my  Obligations  and  Ingratitude  The  Publick  should not have been troubled with this State of the Case had not these Insinuations been industriously propagated at this Crisis both to hurt my Interest in my  Subscription  for my  Remarks on  SHAKESPEARE which will now shortly appear in the World and in that  Play  which is designed for my  Benefit  on  Monday  next in the Theatre at  Drury Lane  Double Falshood  It is my Misfortune I can boast but of a very scanty Interest and much less Merit and consequently Both are the more easily to be shocked I had no Method but This of appealing to those Many whom I have not the Honour of approaching for their  Favour  and of humbly hoping it the rather because all my poor Attempts in Writing are calculated to entertain and none  at the Expence of any
