 PAMELA  OR Virtue Rewarded In a SERIES of FAMILIAR LETTERS From a Beautiful Young DAMSEL to her PARENTS And afterwards In her EXALTED CONDITION BETWEEN HER and Persons of  Figure  and  Quality  UPON THE MOST Important and Entertaining Subjects In GENTEEL LIFE  The THIRD and FOURTH VOLUMES  Publish'd in order to cultivate the Principles of VIRTUE and RELIGION in the Minds of the YOUTH of BOTH SEXES  By the Editor of the  TWO FIRST    VOL III  LONDON Printed for S RICHARDSON And Sold by C RIVINGTON in  St Paul  's  ChurchYard  and J OSBORN in  Paternoster Row    MDCCXLII  PREFACE  THE Two former Volumes of  PAMELA  or  VIRTUE REWARDED  met with a Success greatly exceeding the most sanguine Expectations And the Editor hopes that the Letters which compose these will be found equally written to  NATURE  avoiding all romantick Flights improbable Surprizes and irrational Machinery and that the Passions are touched where requisite and Rules equally  New  and  Practicable  inculcated throughout the Whole for the  General Conduct of Life  And therefore he flatters himself that they may expect the good Fortune which few  Continuations  have met with to be judg'd not unworthy the First nor disproportion'd  to the more exalted Condition in which  PAMELA  was destin'd to shine as an affectionate  Wife  a faithful  Friend  a polite and kind  Neighbour  an indulgent  Mother  and a beneficent  Mistress  after having in the Two former Volumes supported the Character of a dutiful  Child  a spotless  Virgin  and a modest and amiable  Bride    The Reader will easily see that in so great a Choice of Materials as must arise from a Multitude of important Subjects in a married Life to such Genius's and Friendships as those of Mr and Mrs  B  the Editor's greatest Difficulty was how to bring them within the Compass which he was determined not to exceed And it having been left to his own Choice in what manner to digest and publish the Letters and where to close the Work he had intended at first in regard to his other Avocations end some Designs of  another Nature in which he was engaged to have carry'd the Piece no farther than the Two former Volumes as may be gathe'd from the Conclusion of the FirstFive Editions  It may be expected therefore that he should enter into an Explanation of the Reasons whereby he was provoked into a Necessity of altering his Intention But he is willing to decline saying Anything upon so wellknown a Subject lest his Interest might appear more concern'd than the Satisfaction of the Publick  The Editor has been much press'd with Importunities and Conjectures in relation to the Person and Family of the incomparable Lady who is the Subject of these Volumes All that he thinks himself at Liberty to say or is necessary to be said is only to repeat what has been already hinted That the Story has its Foundation in  Truth That the most material Incidents as will be collected from several Passages in the Letters happen'd between the Years    and    And that there was a Necessity for obvious Reasons to vary and disguise some Facts and Circumstances as also the Names of Persons Places  c  ERRATA  Vol III p l dele  it  p l dele

God bless you both with long Life and Health to enjoy your sweet Farm and pretty Dwelling which is just what I wished it to be And don't make your grateful Hearts too uneasy in the Possession of it by your modest Diffidence of your own Worthiness For at the same time that it is what will do Honour to the best of Gentlemen  it is not so  very  extraordinary considering his Condition as that it will give any one Cause to censure it as the Effect of a too partial and injudicious Kindness for the Parents of one whom he  delighteth to honour    My dear Master why should I not still call him so bound to reverence him as I am in every Light that he can shine in to the most obliged and sensible Heart holds his kind Purpose of fitting up the large Parlour and three Apartments in the commodious Dwelling he calls yours for his Entertainment and mine when he shall permit me to pay my Duty to you both for a few happy Days together and he has actually given Orders for that Purpose and that the three Apartments be so fitted up as to be rather suitable to  your  Condition than his  own  for he says the plain simple Elegance which he will have to be observed in the Rooms as well as the Furniture will be a Variety in his Retirement to this Place that will make him return to his own with the greater Pleasure and at the same time when we are not there will be of Use for the Reception of any of your Friends and so he shall not as he kindly says rob the good Couple of any of their Accommodations  The old Bowwindows he will have preserv'd but will not have them sash'd nor the Woodbinds Jessamines and Vines that run up against them destroyed only he will have larger Panes of Glass and convenienter Casements to let in more of the sweet Air and Light to make amends for that obstructed by the Shades of those fragrant Climbers For he has mention'd three or four times how gratefully they dispens'd their intermingled Odours to us when the last Evening we stood at the Window in our Bedchamber to hear the responsive  Songs of two warbling Nightingales one at a Distance the other near which took up our delighted Attention for above two Hours and charm'd us the more as we thought their Season had been over And when they had done he made  me  sing him one and called me for it the sweetest of all Nightingales saying How greatly do the innocent Pleasures I now hourly taste exceed the guilty Tumults that used formerly to agitate my unequal Mind Never talk my  Pamela  as you frequently do of Obligation to me One such Hour as I now enjoy is an ample Reward for all the Benefits I can confer on you and yours in my whole Life  The Parlour indeed will be more elegant tho' that is to be rather plain than rich as well in its Wainscot as Furniture and to be new floor'd The dear Gentleman has already given Orders about it and you will soon have Workmen with you to put them in Execution The Parlour Doors are to have Brass Hinges and Locks and to shut as close he tells them as a Watchcase For who knows said he my Dear but we shall have still added Blessings in two or three charming Boys and Girls to place there in their Infancy before they can be of Age to be benefited by your Lessons and Example And besides I make no doubt but I shall entertain there some of my chosen Friends in their Excursions for a Day or so  How am I every Hour of my Life overwhelm'd with Instances of God Almighty's Goodness and his O spare blessed Father of Mercies the precious Life of this excellent Gentleman and increase my Thankfulness and my Worthiness and then But what shall I sayOnly that then I may  continue  to be what I am for more bless'd and more happy in my own Mind surely I cannot be  The Beds he will have of Cloth because he thinks the Situation a little cold especially when the Wind is Easterly and because he purposes to be down in the early Spring Season nowandthen as well as in the latter Autumn and the Window Curtains of the same in one Room red in the other green but plain lest you should be afraid to use them occasionally The Carpets for them will come down with the other Furniture for he will nor alter the old Oaken Floors of the Bedchamber nor yet of the little Room he intends for my Use to withdraw to when I chuse not to join in such Company as may happen to fall in Which my Dear says he shall be as little as is possible only particular Friends who may be disposed once in a Year or two to see when I am there how I live with my  Pamela  and her Parents and how I pass my Time in my Retirement as I shall call this For otherwise perhaps they will be apt to think I am asham'd of Company I shall always be pleased withNor are you my Dear continued he to take this as a Compliment to yourself but a Piece of requisite Policy in me for who will offer to reproach me for marrying as the World thinks below me when they shall see that such a Reproach as they would intend it is so far from being so to me that every Day of my Life I not only pride myself in my  Pamela  but take Pleasure in owning her Relations as mine and visiting them and receiving Visits from them and yet offer not to set them up in such a glaring Light as if I would have the World forget who in that Case would always take the more Pleasure in remembering what they were And how will it anticipate low Reflection when they shall see I can bend my Mind to partake with them the Pleasures of their humble but decent LifeAy continued he and  be rewarded for it too with better Health better Spirits and a better Mind so that my Dear added he I shall reap more Benefit by what I propose to do than I shall confer  In this generous manner does this best of Gentlemen endeavour to disclaim tho' I must be very ungrateful if with me it did not inhance the proper Merit of a Beneficence that is natural to him and which indeed as I tell him may be in one respect depreciated inasmuch as so excellent is his Nature he cannot help it if he wouldO that it was in my Power to recompense him for it But I am poor as I have often said in every thing but Will and that is  wholly  his And what a Happiness is it to me a  Happiness  I could not so early have hoped for that I can say so without  Reserve  since the dear Gentleman requires nothing of me but what is consistent with my Duty to the supreme Benefactor the first Mover and Cause of all his own Happiness of my Happiness and of that of my dear my ever dear Parents  But whither does the inchanting Subject lead me I am running on to my usual Length tho' I have not the same Excuse for it for heretofore I had nothing to do but to write Yet I am sure if I do exceed a little  you  will be pleased with it and you have moreover a Right to rejoice with me in the Days of my Felicity after your indulgent Hearts had been so much pained by a long Succession of my Fears and my Dangers which only ought to be remember'd now as Subjects of thankful Exultation by  Your dutiful and happy Daughter  LETTER II  My dearest Daughter  I Need not repeat to you the Sense your good Mother and I have of our Happiness and of our Obligations to your honoured Spouse You both were pleased Witnesses of it every Hour of the happy Fortnight you passed with us But still my Dear we hardly know how to address ourselves even to  You  much less to the  'Squire  with the Freedom he so often invited us to take For I don't know how it is but tho' you are our Daughter and are so far from being lifted up by your high Condition that we see no Difference in your Behaviour to us your poor Parents yet when we look upon you as the Lady of so fine a Gentleman we cannot forbear having a kind of Respect and I don't know what to call it that lays a little Restraint upon us And yet we would not methinks let our Minds be run away with the Admiration of worldly Grandeur so as to set too much by it  But your Merit and your Prudence my dear Daughter is so much above all we could ever have any Notion of itAnd to have Gentry come only to behold you and admire you not so much for your Genteelness and Amiableness neither as for your Behaviour and your Affability to Poor as well as Rich and to hear every one calling you an Angel and saying you  deserve  to be what you are makes us hardly know how to look upon you but as an Angel indeed I am sure you have been a good Angel to usSince for your sake God Almighty has put it into your honour'd Husband's Heart to make us the happiest Couple in the World But little  less indeed we should have been had we only in some far distant Land heard of our dear Child's Happiness and never partaken of the Benefits of it ourselves But thus to be provided forThus kindly to be owned and called Father and Mother by such a brave Gentleman and thus to be placed that we have nothing to do but to bless God and bless him and bless you and hourly pray for you  both  is such a Providence my dear Child as is too mighty to be borne by us with Equalness of Temper and we kneel together every Morning Noon and Night and weep and rejoice and rejoice and weep to think how our Unworthiness is distinguished and how God has provided for us in our latter Days when all we had to fear was that as we grew older and more infirm and worn out by hard Labour we should be troublesome where not our Pride but our industrious Wills would have made us wish not to be sobut to be intitled to a happier Lot For this would have grieved us the more for the sake of you my dear Child and your unhappy Brother's Children for it is well known that tho' we pretend not to boast of our Family and indeed had no Reason yet none of us were ever sunk so low as I wasTo be sure partly by my own Fault for had it been for your poor aged Mother's sake only I ought not to have done what I did for  John  and  William  for so unhappy were they poor Lads that what I could do was but as a Drop of Water to a Bucket  But yet the Issue has shewn that if I may presume to say so what I did was not displeasing to God inasmuch as I have the Comfort to see that my Reliance on Him while I was doing what though some thought  imprudent  Things yet not  wrong  Things is so abundantly rewarded beyond  Expectation and Desert Blessed be his holy Name for it  You command meLet me as writing to Mr  B  's Lady say  command  tho' as to my dear  Daughter  I will only say  desire  And indeed I will not as you wish'd me not to do let the one Condition which was accidental put the other which was natural out of my Thought You spoke it in better Words but this was the Sense But you have the Gift of Utterance and Education is a fine thing where it meets with such Talents to improve upon as God has given youBut let me not forget what I was going to say You  command  or if you pleaseyou desire me to write long Letters and oftenAnd how can I help it if I would For when here in this happy Dwelling and this wellstock'd Farm in these rich Meadows and wellcropt Acres we look around us and which Way soever we turn our Heads see Blessings upon Blessings and Plenty upon Plenty see Barns wellstor'd Poultry increasing the Kine lowing and crouding about us and all fruitful and are bid to call all these our ownAnd then think that all is the Reward of our Child's VirtueO my dear Daughter who can bear these ThingsExcuse meI must break off a little for my Eyes are as full as my Heart and I will retire to bless God and your honoured Husband  Somy dear ChildI now again take up my Pen But reading what I had written in order to carry on the Thread I can hardly forbear again being in like sort affectedBut do you think I will call all these Things my ownDo you think I will live RentfreeDo you think I would Can the honoured 'Squire believe that having such a generous  Example before me if I had no Gratitude in my Temper before I could help being touched by such an one as he sets meIf his Goodness makes him know no Mean in giving shall I be so greedy as to know none in receivingCome come my dear Child your poor Father is not so sordid a Wretch neither He will shew the World that all these Benefits are not thrown away upon one who will disgrace you as much by his Temper as by his Condition What tho' I cannot be as worthy of all these Favours as I wish I will be as worthy as I can And let me tell you my dear Child if the King and his Royal Family God bless 'em be not ashamed to receive Taxes and Duties from his Subjects if Dukes and Earls and all the top Gentry cannot support their Bravery without having their Rents paid I hope I shall not affront the 'Squire to pay to his Steward what any other Person would pay for this noble Stock and improving Farm And I will do it an' it please God to bless me with Life and Health I should not be worthy to crawl on the Earth if I did not And what did I say to Mr  Longman  the faithful Mr  Longman  sure no Gentleman had ever a more worthy Steward than he It was as we were walking over the Grounds togetherand observing in what good Order every thing was he was praising some little Contrivances of my own for the Improvement of the Farm and saying how comfortably he hoped we might live upon it Ay Mr  Longman  said I comfortably indeed But do you think I could be properly said to  live  if I was not to pay as much Rent for it as anotherI can tell you said he the 'Squire will not receive any thing from you Goodman  Andrews  Why Man he has no Occasion for it He's worth a Power of Money besides a noble and clear Estate in LandAdsheartlikins you  must not affront him I can tell you that For he's as generous as a Prince where he takes but he is hasty and will have his own wayWhy for that Reason Mr  Longman  said I I was thinking to make  you  my Friend Make  me  your Friend You have not a better in the World to my Power I can tell you that nor your Dame neither for I love such honest Hearts I wish my own Brother would let me love him as well but let that passWhat I can do for you I will and here's my Hand upon it  Well then said I it is this Let me account to you at the Rent Farmer  Dickins  offered and let me know what the Stock cost and what the Crops are valued at and pay the one as I can and the other Quarterly and not let the 'Squire know it till you can't chuse and I shall be as happy as a Prince for I doubt not by God's Blessing to make a comfortable Livelihood of it besidesWhy dost believe Goodman  Andrews  said he I would do such a thingWould not his Honour think if I hid one thing from him I might not hide anotherGo to go to honest Heart I love thee dearly But can the 'Squire do too much for his Lady think'st thou Come come and he jeer'd me so I could not tell what to say to him I wish at Bottom there is not some Pride in thiswhat I warrant you would not be too much beholden to his Honour would youNo good Mr  Longman  said I it is not that I'm sure If I have any Pride it is only in my dear Childto whom under God all this is owingBut some how or other it shall be so  And so my dear Daughter I resolve it shall and it will be over and above one of the greatest Pleasures to me to do the good 'Squire Service as well as to be so much benefited and obliged by him  Our eldest Grandson  Thomas  is very desirous to come and live with us The Boy is honest and they tell me industrious And Cousin  Burroughs  wants me to employ his Son  Roger  who understands the Business of a Farm very well It is no wonder that all one's Relations should wish to partake of our happy Lot and if they  can  and  will  do their Business as well as others I see not why Relationship should be an Objection But yet I think one would not  beleaguer  as one may say your honoured Husband with one's Relations You my best Child will give me always your Advice as to my Carriage in this my new Lot for I would not for the World be thought an Incroacher And I am sure you have so much Prudence that there is nobody's Advice fitter to be followed than yours  Our Blessings I am sure you have blessed us attend you my dearest Child and may you be as happy as you have made us I cannot wish you to be happier because I have no Notion how it can be in this Life conclude us  Your ever loving Father and Mother  John  and  ELIZ ANDREWS  May we not hope to be favour'd nowandthen with a Letter from you my dear Child like some of your former to let us know how you go on It would be a great Joy to us Indeed it wouldBut we know you'll have enough to do without obliging us in this way So must acquiesce  LETTER III  My dear Father and Mother  I HAVE shew'd your Letter to my Bestbeloved Don't be uneasy that I havefor you need not be ashamed of it since it is my Pride to have such honest and grateful Parents And I'll tell you what he said to it as the best Argument I can use why you should not be uneasy but enjoy without Pain or Anxiety all the Benefits of your happy Lot  Dear good Souls said he how does every thing they say and every thing they write manifest the Worthiness of their Hearts No Wonder  Pamela  you love and revere such honest Minds for that you would do were they not your Parents And tell them that I am so far from having them believe that what I have done for them is only the Effect of my Affection for their Daughter that let 'em find out another Couple as worthy as themselves and I will do as much for them Indeed I would not place them continued the dear Obliger in the  same  County because I would wish  two  Counties to be blest for their sakes Tell them my Dear that they have a Right to what they enjoy on the foot of their own  proper  Merit and  bid  them enjoy it as their Patrimony And if there can any thing arise that is more than they themselves can wish for in the way of Life they chuse to live let them look round among their own Relations where it may be acceptable and communicate to them the like solid Reasons for rejoicing in the Situation they are pleased with And do you my Dear continued he still further enable them as you shall judge proper to gratify their inlarged Hearts for fear they should deny any Comfort to themselves in order to do good to others  I could only fly to his generous Bosom for this is a Subject which most affects me and with my Eyes swimming in Tears of grateful Joy and which overflow'd as soon as my bold Lips touch'd his dear Face bless God and him with my whole Heart for speak I could not But almost choak'd with my Joy sobb'd to him my grateful Acknowledgment He clasped me in his Arms and said How my Dearest do you overpay me for the little I have done for your Parents If it be thus to be bless'd for conferring Benefits so insignificant to a Man of my Fortune what Joys is it not in the Power of rich Men to give themselves whenever they please Foretastes indeed of those we are bid to hope for which can surely only exceed these as  then  we shall be all Intellect and better fitted to receive them 'Tis too muchtoo much said I in broken AccentsHow am I oppressed with the Pleasure you give meOh Sirbless me more gradually and more cautiouslyfor I cannot bear it And indeed my Heart went flutter flutter flutter at his dear Breast as if it wanted to break its too narrow Prison to mingle still more intimately with his own  Surely surely my dear my beloved Parents nobody's Happiness is so great as mineIf it proceeds thus from Degree to Degree and is to be augmented by the Hope the charming Hope that the dear second Author of your Blessings and mine be the uniformly good as well as the partially kind Man to us what a Felicity will this be And if our Prayers shall be heard and we shall have the Pleasure to think that his Advances in Piety are owing not a little to them and to the Example God shall give us Grace to set then indeed may we take the Pride to think we have repaid his Goodness to us and that we have satisfied the Debt which nothing less can discharge  Thus then do I set before you imperfectly as I am forced to do the Delight your grateful your honest Hearts give us I say imperfectly and well I may for I might as easily paint Sound as describe the noble the sublime Pleasures that wind up my Affections to even a painful Height of Rapture on such Occasions as this And I desire as he often bids  me  that you will take to yourselves the Merit of thus delighting us both and then think with less Uneasiness of the Obligation you are under to the best of FriendsAnd indeed it is but doing Justice to his beneficent Temper to think that we have given him an Opportunity of exercising it in a way so agreeable to it and I can tell by the Ardour of his Speech by the additional Lustre that it lights up in his Eyes naturally so lively and by the virtuous Endearments refined on these Occasions above what Sense can know that he has a Pleasure a Joy a Transport in doing what he does of this sort that is its own Reward as every virtuous and noble Action must be to a Mind that can be delighted with Virtue for its own sake and can find itself inlarged by the Power of doing Good to worthy Objects Even I my dear Parents know this by Experience when I can be an humble Means to make an honest Creature happy tho' not related to myself and yet I am but a Thirdhand Dispenser as I have  See  Vol II  p    elsewhere said of these Comforts and all the Light I can communicate as I once before observed  See  Vol II  p    like that of the Moon is but borrowed from his sunny Radiance  Forgive me my dear my worthy Parents if my Style on this Subject be raised above that natural Simplicity which is more suited to my humble Talents But how can I help it For when the Mind is elevated ought not the Sense we have of our Happiness to make our Expressions soar  equally Can the Affections be so highly raised as mine are on these Occasions and the Thoughts creep groveling like one's ordinary Self No indeed Call not this therefore the Gift of Utterance if it should appear to you in a better Light than it deserves It is the Gift of Gratitude A Gift which makes you and me too  speak  and  write  as I hope it will make us  act  above ourselves And thus will our Gratitude be the Inspirer of Joy to our common Benefactor and his Joy will heighten our Gratitude and so we shall proceed as Cause and Effect to each other's Happiness to bless the dear Gentleman that blesses usAnd will it be right then to say you are so uneasy under such at least as to your Wills returned and discharged Obligations God Almighty requires only a thankful Heart for all the Mercies he heaps upon the Children of Men My dear Mr  B  who in these Particulars imitates Divinity desires no moreYou  have  this thankful Heartyes you have and that to such a high Degree of Gratitude that nobody can exceed you  But yet my dear Parents when your worthy Minds would be too much affected with your Gratitude so as to lay you under the Restraints you mention to the dear Gentleman and for his sake to your dependent Daughter then let me humbly advise you that you will at such Times with more particular more abstracted Aspirations than at others raise your Thoughts upwards and consider who it is that gives  him  the Opportunity and pray for him and for me for  him  that all his future Actions may be of a Piece with this noble Disposition of Mind for  me  that I may continue humble and consider myself blest for your sakes and in order that I may be in some sort a Rewarder in the Hands of Providence of this its dear excellent Agent and  then we shall look forward all of us with Pleasure indeed to that State where there is no Distinction of Degree and where the humble Cottager shall be upon a Par with the proudest Monarch  O my dear dear Parents how can you as in your  Postscript  say May we not be  favoured  nowandthen with a Letter Call  me  your Daughter your  Pamela  I am no Lady to you I have more Pleasure to be called your Comfort and to be thought to act worthy of the Sentiments with which your Examples Cautions and Instructions have inspired me than in any one thing in this Life my determined Duty to our common Benefactor the best of Gentlemen and Husbands excepted And I am sure God has blessed me for your sakes and has thus answered for me all your Prayers nay  more  than answered all you or I could have wished or hoped for We only prayed only hoped that God would preserve  you  honest and  me  virtuous And see O see my excellent Parents how we are crown'd with Blessings upon Blessings till we are the Talk of all that know us You for your Honesty I for my Humility and Virtue that Virtue which God's Grace inspired and your Examples and Lessons with those of my dear good Lady cultivated and which now have left me nothing to do but to reap all the Rewards which this Life can afford and if I walk humbly and improve my blessed Opportunities will heighten and perfect all in a still more joyful Futurity  Hence my dear Parents I mean from the Delight I have in writing to you a Delight which transports me so much above my own Sphere you'll see that I  must  write to you and cannot help it if I would And  will  it be a great Joy to youAnd is there any thing that can add to your Joy think you that is in the Power of your  Pamela  that she would  not  do  O that the Lives and Healths of my dearest Mr  B  and my dearest Parents may be continued to me And who then can be so blest as your  Pamela  I  will  write  depend  upon it I will on every Occasion And you augment my Joys to think it is in my Power to add to your Comforts Nor can you conceive the Pleasure I have in hoping that this your new happy Lot may by relieving you from corroding Care and the too wearing Effects of hard Labour add in these your advanced Years to both your Days For so happy am I I can have no Grief no Pain in looking forward but from such Thoughts as remind me that one Day either you from me or I from you must be separated  But 'tis fit that we so comport ourselves as that we should not imbitter our present Happiness with Prospects too gloomy but bring our Minds to be chearfully thankful for the present wisely to enjoy that  present  as we go along and at last when all is to be wound up lie down and say  Not mine  but  thy Will be done  But I have written a great deal yet have much still to say relating to other Parts of your kind your acceptable Letter and so will soon write again For I must think every Opportunity happy whereby I can assure you how much I am and will ever be without any Addition to my Name if that will make you easier  Your dutiful  PAMELA  LETTER IV  My dearest Father and Mother  I Now write again as I told you I should in my last But I am half afraid to look back on the Copy of it for your worthy Hearts so visible in your  Letter and my best Beloved's kind Deportment upon shewing it to him raised me into a Frame of Mind that was bordering on Ecstasy Yet am I sure I wrote my Heart But you must not my dear Father write to your poor  Pamela  so affectingly Your  steadier  Mind could hardly bear your own moving Strain and you was forced to lay down your Pen and retire How then could I who love you so dearly if you had not if I may so say  increased  that Love by fresh and stronger Instances of your Worthiness forbear being affected and raised above myselfBut I will not again touch upon this Subject  You must know then that my dearest Spouse commands me with his kind Respects to tell you that he has thought of a Method to make your  worthy Hearts  easy those were his WordsAnd this is said he by putting that whose Estate with the new Purchase under your Father's Care as I at first intended  See  Vol II  p    and he shall receive and pay and order every thing as he pleases and  Longman  who grows in Years shall be eased of that Burden Your Father writes said he a very legible Hand and he shall take what Assistants he pleases And do you  Pamela  see to that that this new Task may be made as easy and pleasant to him as possible He shall make up his Accounts only to you my Dear And there will be several Pleasures arise to me upon it continued he First That it will be a Relief to honest  Longman  who has Business enough on his Hands besides Next It will make the good Couple easy that they have an Opportunity of enjoying that as their Due which now their too grateful Hearts give them so many causeless Scruples about▪  Thirdly it will employ your Father's Time more suitably to  your  Liking and  mine  because with more Ease to himself for you see his industrious Will cannot be satisfied without doing something In the fourth Place the Management of this Estate will gain him more Respect and Reverence among the Tenants and his Neighbours and yet be all in his own way For my Dear added he you'll see that it is always one Point in View with me to endeavour to convince every one that I esteem and value them for their own intrinsick Merit and want not any body to distinguish them in any other Light than that in which they have been accustomed to appear  So my dear Father the Instrument will be drawn and brought you by honest Mr  Longman  who will be with you in a few Days to put the last Hand to the new Purchase and to give you Possession of your new Commission if you please to accept it as I hope you will and the rather for my dear Mr  B  's third Reason and because I know that this Trust will be discharged as worthily and as sufficiently after you are used to it as if Mr  Longman  himself was in it And better it cannot be Mr  Longman  is very fond of this Relief and longs to be down to settle every thing with you as to the proper Powers the Method  c  and he says in his usual way of Phrasing that he'll make it as easy to you as a Glove  If you do accept it my best Beloved will leave every thing to you as to Rent where not already fixed and likewise as to Acts of Kindness and Favour to be done where you think proper and he is pleased to say That with all his bad Qualities he was ever deemed a kind Landlord and this I can confirm in fifty Instances to his Honour So that the old Gentleman said he need not be afraid of being put upon severe or harsh Methods of Proceeding where Things will do without and he'll always have it in  his Power to befriend an honest Man So that the Province will be intirely such a one as suits with his Inclination If any thing difficult or perplexing arises continued he or where a little Knowledge in Lawmatters is necessary  Longman  shall do all that And your Father will see that he will not have in those Points a Coadjutor that will be too hardhearted for his Wish For it was a Rule my Father set me and I have strictly followed that tho' I have a Lawyer for my Steward it was rather to know how to do  right  Things than  oppressive  ones and  Longman  has so well answered this Intention that he was always more noted for composing Differences than promoting Lawsuits  I dare say my dear Father this will be an acceptable Employment to you on the several Accounts my dearest Mr  B  was pleased to mention And what a charming Contrivance is hereGod forever bless his considerate Heart for itTo make you useful to him and easy to yourself as well as respected by and even a Benefactor to all around you What can one say to all these ThingsBut what signifies exulting in one's Gratitude for  one  Benefit Every Hour the dear Gentleman heaps new ones upon us and we have hardly Time to thank him for one but a second and a third and so on to countless Degrees confound one and throw back one's Words upon one's Heart before they are well formed and oblige one to sit down under all with profound Silence and Admiration  As to what you mention of the Desire of Cousin  Thomas  and  Roger  to come to live with you I endeavoured to sound what our dear Benefactor's Opinion was He was pleased to say I have nothing to chuse in this Case my Dear Your Father is his own Master He may employ whom he pleases and if they are not wanting in Respect to him and your  Mother I think as he rightly observes Relationship should rather have the Preference and as he can remedy Inconveniences if he finds any by all means let every Branch of your Family have Reason to rejoice with him  But I have thought of this Matter a good deal since I had the Favour of your Letter and I hope since you condescend to ask my Advice you will excuse me if I give it freely yet intirely submitting all to your own Liking  In the first Place then I think it would be better to have  any body  than Relations and that for these Reasons  One is apt to expect more Regard from Relations and they more Indulgence than Strangers can have Reason for  That where there is such a Difference in the Expectations of both it is hardly possible but Uneasiness must arise  That this will subject you to bear it or to resent it and to part with them If you bear it you will know no End of Impositions If you dismiss them it will cccasion Illwill They will call you unkind and you them ungrateful and as it may be your prosperous Lot will raise you Enviers such will be apt to believe  them  rather than  you    Then the World will be inclined to think that we are crouding upon a generous Gentleman a numerous Family of indigent People and tho' they may be ever so deserving yet it will be said The Girl is filling every Place with her Relations and  beleaguering  as you significantly express it a worthy Gentleman And this will be said perhaps should one's Kindred behave ever so worthily And so  In the next Place one would not for  their  Sakes that this should be done who may live with  less  Reproach and  equal  Benefit anywhere else For I would not wish any one of them to be lifted out of his Station and made independent at Mr  B  's Expence if their Industry will not do it altho' I would never scruple to do any thing reasonable to promote or assist that Industry in the way of their Callings  Then it will possibly put others of our Relations upon the same Expectations of living with you and this may occasion Illwill among them if some be preferred to others in your Favour  Then my dear Father I apprehend that our beloved and honoured Benefactor would be under some Difficulty from his natural Politeness and Regard for you and meYou see how kindly on all Occasions he treats you both not only as the Father and Mother of his  Pamela  but as if you were his own Father and Mother And if you had any body as your Servants there who called you Cousin or Grandfather or Uncle he would not care when he came down to treat them on the Foot of common Servants tho'  they  might nevertheless think themselves honoured as they would be and as I am sure I shall always think  myself  with his Commands And would it not if they are modest and worthy be as great a Difficulty upon  them  to be thus distinguished as it would be to  him  and to  me  for  his  sake For otherwise believe me I hope you will my dear Father and Mother I could sit down and rejoice with the meanest and remotest Relation I have But in the World's Eye to every body but my best of Parents I must if I have ever so much Reluctance to it appear in a Light that may not give Discredit to his Choice  Then again as I hinted you will have it in your Power without the least Injury to our common Benefactor to do kinder Things by any of our Relations when  not  with you than you can do if they  live  with you  You may lend them a little Money to put them in a way if any thing offers that you think will be to their Advantage You can fit out my SheCousins to good reputable PlacesThe younger you can put to School or when fit to Trades according to their Talents and so they will be of course in a way to get an honest and creditable Livelihood  But above all things one would as much discourage as one could such a proud and ambitious Spirit in any of them as should want to rase itself by Favour instead of Merit and this the rather for that undoubtedly there are many more happy Persons in low than in high Life take Number for Number all the World over  I am sure altho' four or five Years of different Life had passed with me I had so much Pride and Pleasure in the Thought of working for my Living with you my dear Parents if I could but get honest to you that it made my Confinement the more grievous to me and even if possible aggravated the Apprehensions attending it  But I must beg of you not to harbour a Thought that these my Reasons proceed from the bad Motives of a Heart tainted with Pride on its high Condition Indeed there can be no Reason for it to one who thinks after this mannerThe greatest Families on Earth have some among them who are unhappy and low in Life and shall such an one reproach me with having twenty low Relations because they have peradventure not above Five or with Ten because they have but one or two or  threeOr should I on the other hand be asham'd of Relations who had done nothing blameworthy and whose Poverty a very necessary State in the Scale of Beings was all their Crime when there is hardly any great Family but has produced Instances of Persons guilty of bad Actions  really  bad which have reduced them to a Distress we never knew Let the Person who would reproach me with  low Birth  which is  no  Disgrace and what I  cannot help  give me no Cause to retort upon him  low Actions  which  are  a Disgrace to any Station the more so the higher it is and which he  can help  or else I shall smile with Contempt at his empty Reproach And could I be half so proud  with  Cause as he is  without  glory in my Advantage over him  Let us then my dear Father and Mother endeavour to judge of one another as God at the last Day will judge of us all And then the honest Peasant will stand fairer in our Esteem than the guilty Peer  In short this shall be my own Rule Every one who acts justly and honestly I will look upon as my Relation whether he be so or not and the more he want my Assistance the more intitled to it he shall be as well as to my Esteem While those who deserve it not must expect nothing but Compassion from me and my Prayers were they my Brothers or Sisters 'Tis true had I not been poor and lowly I might not have thought thus But if it be a right way of Thinking it is a Blessing that I was so and that shall never be matter of Reproach to me which one Day will be matter of Justification  Upon the Whole then I should think it adviseable my dear Father and Mother to make such kind Excuses to the offered Services of my Cousins as your better Reason shall suggest to you and to do  any thing else for them of  more  Value as their Circumstances may require or Occasions offer to serve them  But if the employing them and having them about you will add any one Comfort to your Lives I give up intirely my own Opinion and doubt not every thing will be thought well of that you shall think fit to do  And so I conclude with assuring you that I am my everdear Parents  Your dutiful and happy Daughter  The Copy of this Letter I will keep to myself till I have your Answer to it that you may be under no Difficulty how to act in either of the Cases mentioned in it  LETTER V  My dearest Daughter  HOW shall I do to answer as they deserve your two last Letters Surely no happy Couple ever had such a Child as we have But it is in vain to aim at Words like your Words and equally in vain for us to offer to set forth the Thankfulness of our Hearts on the kind Office your honoured Husband has given us for no Reason but to favour us still more and to quiet our Minds in the Notion of being useful to him God grant I may be able to be soHappy shall I be if I can But I see the generous Drift of his Proposal it is only to make me more easy from the Nature of my Employment and in my Mind too overloaden as I may say with Benefits and at the same time to make me more respected in my new Neighbourhood  I can only say I most gratefully accept of the kind Offer and since it will ease the worthy Mr  Longman  shall with still greater Pleasure do all I can in it But I doubt I shall be wanting in Ability I doubt I shall But I will be just and honest however That by God's Grace will be within my own Capacity and that I hope I may answer for  It is kind indeed to put it in my Power to do good to those who shall deserve it And I will take  double  Pains to find out the true Merit of such as I shall recommend to Favour and that their Circumstances be really such as I shall represent them  But one thing my dear Daughter let me desire that I may make up my Accounts to Mr  Longman  or to his Honour himself when he shall make us so happy as to be here with us I don't know howbut it will make me uneasy if I am to make up my Accounts to you For so well known is your Love to us that tho' you would no more do an unjust thing than by God's Grace we should desire you yet this same illwilling World might think it was like making up Accounts to one's self  Do my dearest Child get me off of this Difficulty and I  can  have no other for already I am in Hopes I have hit upon a Contrivance to improve the Estate and to better the Condition of the Tenants at the same time at least not to worst them and which I hope will please every body But I will acquaint Mr  Longman  with this and take his Advice for I will not be too troublesome either to you my dear Child or to your Spouse If I could act so for his Interest as not to be a Burden what happy Creatures should we both be in our own Minds We find ourselves more and more respected by every one and so far as shall be consistent with our new Trust we will endeavour to deserve it that we may  interest as many as know us in our own good Wishes and Prayers for both your Happiness  But let me say how much convinced I am by the Reasons you give for not taking to us any of our Relations Every one of those Reasons has its Force with us How happy are we to have so prudent a Daughter to advise with And I think myself obliged to promise this that whatever I do for any of them above the Amount of forty Shillings at one Time I will take your Direction in it that your wise Hints of making every one continue their Industry and not to rely upon Favour instead of Merit may be followed I am sure this is the way to make them  happier  as well as  better  Men and Women for as I have often thought if one were to have a hundred Pounds a Year in good Comingsin it would not do without Industry and with it one may do with a Quarter of it and less  In short my dear Child your Reasons are so good that I wonder they came not into my Head before and then I needed not to have troubled you about the Matter But yet it ran in my own Thought that I could not like to be an Incroacher For I hate a dirty thing and in the midst of my Distresses never could be guilty of one Thank God for it  You rejoice our Hearts beyond Expression at the Hope you give us of receiving Letters from you nowandthen To be sure it will be the chief Comfort of our Lives next to seeing you as we are put in hope we sometimes shall But yet my dear Child don't let us put you to Inconvenience neither Pray don't You'll have enough upon your Hands without To be sure you will  The Workmen have made a good Progress and wish for Mr  Longman  to come down as we also do  You need not be afraid we should think you proud or lifted up with your Condition You have weathered  the first Dangers and but for your fine Cloaths and Jewels we should not see any Difference indeed we should not between our dear  Pamela  and the muchrespected Mrs  B  But God has given you too much Sense to be proud or lifted up I remember in your former Writings a Saying of the Squire's speaking of you my dear Child That it was for Persons who were not used to Praise and did not deserve it to be proud of it  See  Vol II  p    In like sort one may say it is for Persons of little Sense to be proud but you my dear Child every one sees are  above  it And that methinks is a proud Word is it not If one was notI don't know how halfstupid I believe one would be raised by your high Style of Writing But I should be more than halfstupid I'm sure to aim at it  Every Day brings us Instances of the good Name his Honour and you my dear Child have left behind you in this Country Here comes one and here comes another and a third and a fourth and Goodman  Andrew  cries one and Goody  Andrews  cries another and some call us Mr and Mrs but we like the other full as well When heard you from his Honour How does his Lady do What a charming Couple are they How lovingly they live What an Example do they give to all about them Then one cries God bless 'em both and another cries  Amen  and so says a third and a fourth and all say But when do you expect them down again Suchaone longs to see 'em and suchaone will ride a Day's Journey to have but a Sight of 'em at Church And then they say how this Gentleman praises them and that Lady admires them O my dear Child what a Happiness is this How do your poor Mother and I stand fixed  to the Earth to hear both your Praises our Tears trickling down our Cheeks and our Hearts heaving as if they would burst with Joy till we are forced to take Leave in half Words and handinhand go in together to bless God and bless you bothO my Daughter what a happy Couple have God and you made us  Your poor Mother is very anxious about her dear Child I will not touch upon a Matter so very irksome to you to hear of But tho' the Time may be some Months off she every Hour prays for your Safety and Happiness and for all the Increase of Felicity that his Honour's generous Heart can wish for This is all we will say at present Only that we are with continued Prayers and Blessings my dearest Child  Your loving Father and Mother J  and  E ANDREWS    Yet one Word more and that is Our  Duty  to your honoured Husband We must say so now tho' he forbad us so often before You cannot my dear Child imagine how I was ashamed to have my poor Letter shewn to him I hardly remember what I wrote but it was from my Heart I'm sure so I needed not to keep a Copy for an honest Mind must always be the same in Cases that cannot admit of Change such as those of my Thankfulness to God and to him But don't shew him all I write for I shall be afraid of what I say if I think any body but our Daughter sees it who knows how to allow for her poor Parents Defects  LETTER VI From Lady  DAVERS  to Mrs  B  My dear  Pamela  I HAD intended to have been with you before this but my Lord has been a little indisposed with the Gout and  Jackey  too has had an Intermittent Fever but they are pretty well recovered and it shall not be long before I see you now I understand you are return'd from your  Kentish  Expedition  We have been exceedingly diverted with your Papers You have given us by their Means many a delightful Hour that otherwise would have hung heavy upon us and we are all charm'd with you Lady  Betty  as well as her noble Mamma has always been of our Party whenever we have read your Accounts She is a dear generous Lady and has shed many a Tear over them as indeed we all have and my Lord has not been unmov'd nor  Jackey  neither at some of your Distresses and Reflections Indeed  Pamela  you are a charming Creature and an Ornament to our Sex We wanted to have had you among us an hundred times as we read that we might have lov'd and kiss'd and thank'd you  But after all my Brother generous and noble as he was when your Trials were over was a strange wicked young Fellow and happy it was for you both that he was so cleverly caught in the Trap he had laid for your Virtue  I can assure you my Lord longs to see you and will accompany me for he says he has but a faint Idea of your Person I tell him and tell them all that you are the finest Girl and the most improv'd in Person and Mind I ever beheld and I am nor afraid altho' they should imagine all they can in your Favour  from my Account of you that they will be disappointed when they see you and converse with you But one thing more you must do for us and then we will love you still more and that is you must send us the rest of your Papers down to your Marriage at least and further if you have written further for we all long to see the rest as you relate it tho' we know in general what has passed  You leave off  See  Vol II  p        with an Account of an angry Letter I wrote to my Brother to persuade him to give you your Liberty and a Sum of Money not doubting but his Designs would end in your Ruin and I own it not wishing he would marry you for little did I know of your Merit and Excellence nor could I but for your Letters so lately sent me have had any Notion of either I don't question but if you have recited my passionate Behaviour to you when I was at the Hall I shall make a ridiculous Figure enough but I will forgive all that for the sake of the Pleasure you  have  given me and will still further give me if you comply with my Request  Lady  Betty  says it is the best Story she has heard and the most instructive and she longs to have the Conclusion of it in your own Words She says nowandthen What a hopeful Brother you have Lady  Davers  O these intriguing Gentlemen What Rogueries do they not commit I should have had a fine Husband of him had I receiv'd your Proposal The  dear Pamela  would have run in his Head and had I been the first Lady in the Kingdom I should have stood but a poor Chance in his Esteem for you see his Designs upon her began  See  Vol I  p    l    early  She says you had a good Heart to go back again to him when the violent Wretch had driven you from him on such a slight Occasion But yet she  thinks the Reasons you give  See  Vol II  p    in your Relation and your Love for him which then you began to discover was your Case as well as the Event shew'd you did right  But we'll tell you all our Judgments when we hav read the rest of your Accounts So pray send them as soon as you can to I won't write myself Sister till then  Your affectionate c  DAVERS  LETTER VII  My dear good Lady  YOU have done me great Honour in the Letter your Ladyship has been pleased to send me and it is a high Pleasure to me now all is so happily over that my poor Papers were in the least diverting to you and to such honourable and worthy Persons as your Ladyship is pleased to mention I could wish my dear Lady I might be favour'd with such Remarks on my Conduct so nakedly set forth without any Imagination that they would ever appear in such an Assembly as may be of Use to me in my future Life and make me by that means more worthy than it is otherwise possible I can be of the Honour to which I am raised Do dearest Lady favour me so far I am prepared to receive Blame and to benefit by it and cannot expect Praise so much from my  Actions  as from my  Intentions  for indeed  these  were always just and honourable But why even for these do I talk of Praise since being prompted by Impulses I could not resist it can be no Merit in me to have been govern'd by them  As to the Papers following those in your Ladyship's Hands when I say that they must needs appear impertinent to such Judges after what you know I dare say your Ladyship will not insist upon them yet I will not scruple briefly to mention what they contain  All my Dangers and Trials were happily at an End So that they only contain  "the Conversations that passed between your Ladyship's generous Brother and me his kind Assurances of honourable Love to me my Acknowledgments of Unworthiness to him Mrs  Jewkes  's respectful Change of Behaviour towards me Mr  B  's Reconciliation to Mr  Williams  his introducing me to the good Families in the Neighbourhood and avowing before them his honourable Intentions A Visit from my honest Father who not knowing what to conclude from the Letter I wrote to him before I returned to your honoured Brother desiring my Papers from him came in great Anxiety of Heart to know the worst doubting I had at last been caught by a Stratagem that had ended in my Ruin His joyful Surprize to find how happy I was likely to be All the Hopes given me answer'd by the private Celebration of our Nuptials An Honour so much above all that my utmost Ambition could make me aspire to and which I never can deserve Your Ladyship's Arrival and Anger not knowing I was actually marry'd but supposing me a vile wicked Creature in which Case I should have deserved the worst of Usage Mr  B  's angry Lessons to me for daring to interfere tho' I thought in the tenderest and most dutiful Manner between your Ladyship and himself The most acceptable Goodness and Favour of your Ladyship afterwards to me of which as becomes me I shall ever retain the most grateful  Sense My Return to this sweet Mansion in a manner so different from my quitting it where I had been so happy for four Years in paying my Duty to the best of Mistresses your Ladyship's excellent Mother to whose Goodness in taking me from my poor honest Parents and giving me what Education I have I owe under God my Happiness The Joy of good Mrs  Jervis  Mr  Longman  and all the Servants on this Occasion Mr  B  's acquainting me with Miss  Godfrey  's Affair and presenting to me the pretty Miss  Goodwin  at the Dairyhouse Our Appearance at Church the Favour of the Gentry in the  Neighbourhood  who knowing your Ladyship had not disdain'd to look upon me and to be favourable to me came the more readily into a neighbourly Intimacy with me and still so much the more readily as the continued Kindness of my dear Benefactor and his condesending Deportment to me before them as if I had been worthy of the Honour done me did Credit to his own generous Act"  These my Lady down to my good Parents setting out to this Place in order to be settled by my honoured Benefector's Bounty in the  Kentish  Farm are the most material Contents of my remaining Papers And tho' they might be the most agreeable to those for whom only they were written yet  as  they were principally Matters of course after what your Ladyship has with you  as  the Joy of my fond Heart can be better judg'd of by your Ladyship than described by me and  as  your Ladyship is acquainted with all the Particulars the can be worthy of any other Person's Notice but my dear Parents I am sure your Ladyship will dispense with your Commands and I make it my humble Request that you will  For Madam you must needs think that when my Doubts were dispell'd when I was confident all my Trials were over when I had a Prospect before me of being so abundantly rewarded for what I had suffer'd when every Hour rose upon me with new Delight and fraught with fresh Instances of generous Kindness from such a dear Gentleman my Master my Benefactor the Son of my honoured Lady your Ladyship must needs think I say that I must be  too  much affected my Heart must be  too  much open'd and especially as it then reliev'd from its past Anxieties and Fears which had kept down and damp'd the latent Flame first discover'd to me Impressions of which before I hardly thought it susceptible So that it is scarce possible that my  Joy  and my  Prudence  if I were to be try'd by such Judges of Delicacy and Decorum as Lord and Lady  Davers  the honoured Countess and Lady  Betty  could be so  intimately  so  laudably  coupled as were to be wish'd Altho' indeed the continued Sense of my Unworthiness and the Disgrace the dear Gentleman would bring upon himself by his generous Goodness to me always went handinhand with that my  Joy  and my  Prudence  and what these Considerations took from the  former  being added to the  latter  kept me steadier and more equal to myself than otherwise it was possible such a young Creature as I could have been  Wherefore my dear good Lady I hope I stand excus'd and shall not bring upon myself the Censure of being disobedient to your Commands  Besides Madam as you inform me that my good Lord  Davers  will attend your Ladyship hither I should never dare to look his Lordship in the Face if all the Emotions of my Heart on such affecting Occasions stood confess'd to his Lordship and indeed if I am ashamed they should to your  Ladyship and to the Countess and Lady  Betty  whose Goodness might induce you all three to think favourably in such Circumstances of one who is of your own Sex how would it concern me that the same should appear before such Gentlemen as my Lord and his NephewIndeed I could not look up to either of them in the Sense of thisAnd give me Leave to hope that some of the Scenes in the Letters your Ladyship had were not read to Gentlemen Your Ladyship must needs know which I mean and will think of my two grand Trials of allFor tho' I was the innocent Subject of wicked Attempts and so cannot I hope suffer in any one's Opinion for what I could not help yet for your dear Brother's sake as well as for the Decency of the Matter one would not when one shall have the Honour to appear before my Lord and his Nephew be looked upon methinks with that Levity of Eye and Thought which perhaps hardhearted Gentlemen may pass upon one by reason of those very Scenes which would move Pity and Concern in a good Lady's Breast for a poor Creature so attempted  So my dear Lady be pleased to let me know if the Gentlemen  have  heard allI hope they have notAnd be pleased also to point out to me such Parts of my Conduct as deserve Blame Indeed I will try to make a good Use of your Censure and am sure I shall be thankful for itfor it will make me hope to be more and more worthy of the Honour I have of being exalted into such a distinguished Family and the Right the best of Gentlemen has given me to style myself  Your Ladyship most humble and most obliged Servant  P B  LETTER VIII From Lady  DAVERS  in Reply  My dear  Pamela  YOU have given us all a great Disappointment in declining to oblige me with the Sequel of your Papers I was a little out of Humour with you at firstI must own I wasFor I cannot bear Denial when my Heart is set upon any thing But Lady  Betty  became your Advocate and said She thought you very excusable since no doubt there might be many tender Things circumstanced as you was which might be well enough for your Parents to see but for nobody else and Relations of our Side least of all whose future Intimacy and frequent Visits might give Occasions for Raillery and Remarks that might not be always agreeable I regarded her Apology for you the more because I knew it was a great Balk to her that you did not comply with my Request But now Child when you know me more you'll find that if I am oblig'd to give up one Point I always insist upon another as near it as I can in order to see if it be only  one  thing I am to be refused or  every  thing in which last Case I know how to take my Measures and resent  Now then this is what I insist on That you correspond with me in the same manner you did with your Parents and acquaint me with every Passage that is of Concern to you beginning with your Accounts how you spent your Time both of you when you were in  Kent  for you must know we are all taken with your Duty to your Parents and the Discretion of the good Couple and think you have given a very edifying Example of filial Piety to all who shall hear your Story for if so much Duty is owing to Parents where nothing can be done for one how much more is it to be expected where there  is a Power to add to the natural Obligation all the Comforts and Conveniences of Life We People in upper Life you must know love to hear how Gratitude and unexpected Benefits operate upon honest Minds who have little more than plain artless Nature for their Guide and we flatter ourselves with the Hopes of many a delightful Hour by your Means in this our solitary Situation as it will be if we are obliged to pass the next Winter in it as my Lord and the Earl threaten me and the Countess and Lady  Betty  that we shall Then let us hear of every thing that gives you Joy and Trouble And if my Brother carries you to Town for the Winter while he attends Parliament the Advices you will be able to give us of what passes in  London  and of the public Entertainments and Diversions he will take you to as you will relate them from your own artless and natural Observations will be as diverting to us as if we were at them ourselves For a young Creature of your good Understanding to whom all these Things will be quite new will give us perhaps a better Taste of them their Beauties and Defects than we might have before For we People of Quality go to those Places dress'd out and adorn'd in such Manner outvying one another as if we considered ourselves as so many Parts of the public Entertainment and are too much pleased with ourselves to be able so to attend to what we see as to form a right Judgment of it And indeed we some of us behave with so much Indifference to the Entertainment as if we thought ourselves above being diverted by what we come to see and as if our View was rather to trifle away our Time than to improve ourselves by attending to the Story or the Action  See  Pamela  I shall not make an unworthy Correspondent altogether for I can get into thy grave Way and moralize a little nowandthen And if  you'll promise to oblige me by your constant Correspondence in this way and divest yourself of all Restraint as if you was writing to your Parents and I can tell you you'll write to one who will be as candid and as favourable to you as they can be then I am sure we shall have Truth and Nature from you and these are Things which we are generally so much lifted above by our Conditions that we hardly know what they are  But I have written enough for one Letter And yet having more to say I will after this send another without waiting for your Answer which you may give to both together and am mean time  Yours c  DAVERS  LETTER IX  Dear  Pamela  I AM very glad thy honest Man has let thee into the Affair of  Sally Godfrey  But pr'ythee  Pamela  give us an Account of the Manner in which he did it and of thy Thoughts upon it for that is a critical Case and according as he has represented it so shall I know what to say of it before you and him For I would not make Mischief between you for the World  This let me tell you will be a trying Part of your Conduct For he loves the Child and will judge of you by your Conduct towards it He dearly loved her Mother and notwithstanding her Fault she well deserv'd it For she was a sensible ay and a modest Lady and of an ancient and genteel Family But he was Heir to a noble Estate was of a bold and enterprising Spirit fond of Intrigue Don't let this concern youYou'll have the greater Happiness and Merit too if you can hold himAnd  'tis my Opinion if any body can you willThen he did not like the young Lady's Mother who sought artfully to intrap him So that the poor Girl divided between her Inclination for him and her Duty to her designing Mother gave into the Plot upon him and he thought himself vile Wretch as he was for all thatat Liberty to set up Plot against Plot and the poor Lady's Honour was the Sacrifice  I hope you spoke well of her to him I hope you received the Child kindlyI hope you had Presence of Mind to do thisFor it was a nice Part to act and all his Observations were up I dare say on the Occasion Do let me hear how it was There's my good  Pamela  do And write I charge you freely and without Restraint for altho' I am not your Mother yet am I  his  elder Sister you know and as suchcome I will say so in hopes you'll oblige me  your  Sister and so intitled to expect a Compliance with my Request For is there not a Duty in degree to elder Sisters from younger  As to our Remarks upon your Behaviour they have been very much to your Credit I can tell you that But nevertheless I will to encourage you to enter into this requested Correspondence with me consult Lady  Betty  and will go over your Papers again and try to find fault with your Conduct and if we can see any thing censurable will freely let you know our Minds  But beforehand I can tell you we shall be agreed in one Opinion and that is that we know not who would have acted as you have done upon the Whole  So  Pamela  you see I put myself upon the same Foot of Correspondence with youNot that I will promise to answer every Letter No you must not expect thatYour Part will be a kind of Narrative purposely designed to entertain us here and I  hope to receive six seven eight or ten Letters as it may happen before I return one But such a Part I will bear in it as shall let you know our Opinion of your Proceedings and Relations of Things And as you wish to be found fault with as you say you shall freely have it tho' not in a splenetic or illnatur'd way as often as you give Occasion Now you must know  Pamela  I have two Views in this One is to see how a Man of my Brother's Spirit who has not deny'd himself any genteel Liberties for it must be own'd he never was a common Town Rake and had always Dignity in his Roguery will behave himself to you and in Wedlock which used to be very freely sneered by him The next that I may love you more and more which it will be enough to make me do I dare say as by your Letters I shall be more and more acquainted with you as well as by Conversation so that you can't be off if you would  I know however you will have one Objection to this and that is that your Family Affairs will require your Attention and not give you the Time you used to have for this Employment But consider Child the Station you are raised to does not require you to be quite a domestic Animal You are lifted up to the Rank of a Lady and you must act up to it and not think of setting such an Example as will derive upon you the Illwill and Censure of other LadiesFor will any of our Sex visit one who is continually employing herself in such Works as either must be a Reproach to herself or to themYou'll have nothing to do but to give Orders You will consider yourself as the Taskmistress and the common Herd of Female Servants as so many Negroes directing themselves by your Nod or yourself as the Masterwheel in some beautiful Piece of Mechanism whose dignify'd grave Motion is to set agoing all the  Underwheels with a Velocity suitable to their respective PartsLet your Servants under your Direction do all that relates to Houshold Oeconomy They cannot write to entertain and instruct as you can So what will you have to doI'll answer my own Question In the first Place Endeavour to please your Sovereign Lord and Master and let me tell you any other Woman in  England  be her Quality ever so high would have found enough to do to succeed in that Secondly To receive and pay Visits in order for his Credit as well as your own to make your fashionable Neighbours fond of you Then thirdly You will have Time upon your Hands as your Monarch himself rises early and is tolerably regular for such a Brazenface as he has been to write to me in the manner I have mentioned and expect and I see plainly by your Style that nothing can be easier for you than to do this  And thus and with Reading may your Time be filled up with Reputation to yourself and Delight to others till a fourth Employment puts itself upon you and that is shall I tell you in one Word without mincing the Matter a Succession of brave Boys to perpetuate a Family that has for many hundred Years been esteemed worthy and eminent and which being now reduced in the direct Line to him and me  expects  it from you or else let me tell you nor will I balk it my Brother by descending to the wholsome Cot Excuse me  Pamela  will want one Apology for his Conduct be as excellent as you may  I say this Child not to reflect upon you since the thing is done for I love you dearly and will love you more and morebut to let you know what is expected from you and to encourage you in the Prospect that is already opening to you both and to me who have the Welfare of the Family I sprung from  so much at Heart altho' I know this will be attended with some Anxieties to a Mind so thoughtful and apprehensive as yours seems to be  O but this puts me in mind of your Solicitude for fear the Gentlemen should have seen every thing contained in your LettersBut this I will particularly speak to in a third Letter having fill'd my Paper on all Sides And am  Yours c  DAVERS  You see and I hope will take it as a Favour that I break the Ice and begin first in the indispensably expected Correspondence between us  LETTER X From the same  AND so  Pamela  you are very solicitous to know if the Gentlemen have seen every Part of your Papers I can't say but they have Nor except in regard to the Reputation of your saucy Man do I see why the Parts you hint at might not be read by those to whom the rest might be shewn  I can tell you Lady  Betty  who is a very nice and delicate Lady had no Objections to any Part tho' read before Men Only now and then crying out O the vile ManSee Lord  Davers  what Wretches you Men areAnd commiserating you Ah the poor  Pamela  And expressing her Impatience to hear on how you escap'd at this time and at that and rejoicing in your EscapeAnd nowandthen O Lady  Davers  what a vile Brother you have I hate him perfectly The poor Girl cannot be made Amends for all this tho' he has marry'd her Who that knows these Things of him would wish him to be hers with all his Advantages of Person  Mind and Fortune And suchlike Expressions in your Praise and condemning him and his wicked Attempts  But I can tell you this that except one had heard every Tittle of your Danger how near you were to Ruin and how little he stood upon taking any Measures to effect his vile Purposes even daring to attempt you in the Presence of a  good  Woman which was a Wickedness that every  wicked  Man could not be guilty ofI say except one had known these things one should not have been able to judge of the Merit of your Resistance and how shocking those Attempts were to your Virtue insomuch that Life itself was indanger'd by them Nor let me tell you could I in particular have so well justify'd him for marrying you I mean with respect to his own proud and haughty Temper of Mind if there had been Room to think he could have had you upon easier Terms  It was necessary Child on twenty Accounts that we your and his Wellwishers and Relations should know that he had try'd every Stratagem and made use of every Contrivance to subdue you to his Purpose before he marry'd you And how would it have answer'd to his intrepid Character and Pride of Heart had we not been particularly let into the Nature of those Attempts which you so nobly resisted as to convince us all that you have deserv'd the good Fortune you have met with as well as all the kind and respectful Treatment he can possibly shew you  Nor ought you to be concern'd who sees any the most tender Parts of your Story except as I said for  his  sake for it must be a very unvirtuous Mind that can form any other Ideas from what you relate than those of Terror and Pity for you Your Expressions are too delicate to give the nicest Ear Offence except at himYou paint no Scenes but such  as make his Wickedness odious and that Gentleman much more Lady must have a very corrupt Heart who could from such Circumstances of Distress make any Reflections but what should be to your Honour and in Abhorrence of such Actions Indeed Child I am so convinced of this that by this Rule I would judge of any Man's Heart in the World better than by a thousand Declarations and Protestations I do assure you rakish as  Jackey  is and freely as I doubt not that Lord  Davers  has formerly lived for he has been a Man of Pleasure they gave me by their Behaviour on these tenderer Occasions Reason to think they had more Virtue than not to be very apprehensive for your Safety and my Lord several times exclaim'd that he could not have thought his Brother such a Libertine neither  Besides Child were not these things written in Confidence to your Mother And bad as his Actions were to you if you had not recited all you could recite would there not have been Room for any one who should have seen what you writ to imagine they had been still worse And how could the Terror be supposed to have had such Effects upon you as to indanger your Life without imagining you had undergone the worst that a vile Man  could  offer unless you had told us what that was which he  did  offer and so put a Bound as it were to one's apprehensive Imaginations of what you suffered which otherwise must have been injurious to your Purity tho' you could not help it  Moreover  Pamela  it was but doing Justice to the Libertine himself to tell your Mother the whole Truth that she might know he was not so very abandoned but that he could stop short of the Execution of his wicked Purposes which he apprehended if pursu'd would destroy the Life that of all Lives he would chuse to preserve and you ow'd also thus  much to your Parents Peace of Mind that after all their distracting Fears for you they might see they had Reason to rejoice in an uncontaminated Daughter And one cannot but reflect now all is over and he has made you his Wife that it must be a Satisfaction to the wicked Man as well as to yourself that he was not more guilty than he  was  and that he took no more Liberties than he  did    For my own Part I must say that I could not have accounted for your Fits by any Description short of those you give and had you been less particular in the Circumstances I should have judg'd he had been still  worse  and your Person tho' not your Mind less pure than his Pride would expect from the Woman he should marry For this is the Case of all Rakes that tho' they indulge in all manner of Libertinism themselves there is no Class of Men who exact greater Delicacy than they from the Persons they marry tho' they care not how bad they make the Wives the Sisters and Daughters of others  I have run into Length again so will only add and send all my three Letters together that we all blame you in some degree for bearing the wicked  Jewkes  in your Sight after the most impudent Assistance she gave to his lewd Attempt much less we think ought you to have left her in her Place and rewarded her for her Vileness which could hardly be equalled by the worst Actions of the most abandoned Procuress  I know the Difficulties you lay under in his arbitrary Will and in his Intercession for her But Lady  Betty  rightly observes that he knew what a vile Woman she was when he put you into her Power and no doubt employ'd her because he was sure she would answer all his Purposes and that therefore she should have had very little Opinion of the Sincerity of his Reformation while he was so solicitous in  keeping her there and in having her put on a foot in the Present on your Nuptials with honest  Jervis    She would she says had she been in your Case have had one Struggle for her Dismission let it have been taken as it would and he that was so well pleased with your Virtue must have thought this a natural Consequence of it if he was in earnest to reclaim  I know not whether you shew him all I write or not But I have written this last Part in the Cover as well for want of Room as that you may keep it from him if you please Tho' if you think it will serve any good End I am not against shewing to him all I write For I must ever speak my Mind tho' I were to smart for it and that nobody can or has the Heart to make me do but my bold Brother So  Pamela  for this time  Adieu  LETTER XI  My good Lady  I AM honoured with your Ladyship's Three Letters the Contents of which are highly obliging to me And I should be inexcusable if I did not comply with your Injunctions and be very proud and thankful for your Ladyship's Condescension in accepting of my poor Scribble and promising me such a rich and invaluable Return of which you have given me already such ample and such delightful Instances I will not plead my Defects to excuse my Obedience I only fear that the Awe which will be always upon me when I write to your Ladyship will lay me under so great a Restraint that I shall fall short even of the Merit my Papers have already made for me thro' your kind Indulgence But nevertheless sheltering myself under your Goodness I will chearfully comply with every thing your Ladyship expects from me that is in my Power to do  You will give me Leave Madam to put into some little Method the Particulars of what you desire of me that I may speak to them all For since you are so good as to excuse me from sending the rest of my Papers which indeed would not bear in many Places I will omit nothing that shall tend to convince you of my Readiness to obey you in every thing else  First then your Ladyship would have the Particulars of the happy Fortnight we passed in  Kent  on one of the most agreeable Occasions that could befal me  Secondly An Account of the Manner in which your dear Brother acquainted me with the affecting Story of Miss  Godfrey  and my Behaviour upon it  And thirdly I presume your Ladyship and Lady  Betty  expect that I should say something upon your welcome Remarks on my Conduct towards Mrs  Jewkes    The other Particulars contained in your Ladyship's kind Letters will naturally fall under one or other of these three Heads But expect not my Lady tho' I begin in Method thus that I shall keep up to it If your Ladyship will not allow for me and keep in View the poor  Pamela Andrews  in all I write but will have Mrs  B  in your Eye what will become of me But indeed I promise myself so much Improvement from this Correspondence that I enter upon it with a greater Delight than I can express notwithstanding the mingled Awe and Diffidence that will accompany me in every Part of the agreeable Task  To begin with the first Article  Your dear Brother and my honest Parents I know your Ladyship will expect from me that on  all Occasions I should speak of them with the Duty that becomes a good Child I say then your dear Brother and they and myself set out on the  Monday  Morning for  Kent  passing thro'  St Albans  to  London  at both which Places we stopp'd a Night for our dear Benefactor would make us take easy Journeys and on  Wednesday  Evening we arrived at the sweet Place allotted for the good Couple We were attended only by  Abraham  and  John  on Horseback for Mr  Colbrand  having sprain'd his Foot was in the TravellingCoach with the Cook and HouseMaid and  Polly Barlow  a genteel new Servant whom Mrs  Brooks  recommended to wait on me  Mr  Longman  had been down there for a Fortnight imploy'd in settling the Terms of an additional Purchace to this pretty wellwooded and wellwatered Estate and the Account he gave of his Proceedings was very satisfactory to his honour'd Principal He told us he had much ado to dissuade the Tenants from pursuing a form'd Resolution of meeting their Landlord on Horseback at some Miles Distance for he had inform'd them when he expected us But knowing how desirous Mr  B  was of being retired while he staid here this time he had ventured to assure them that when every thing was settled and the new Purchace actually enter'd upon they would have his Presence among them nowandthen and that he would introduce them all at different times to their worthy Landlord before we left the Country  The House my good Lady is large and very commodious and we found every thing about it and in it exceeding neat and convenient which was owing to the worthy Mr  Longman  's Care and Direction The Ground is wellstock'd the Barns and Outhouses in excellent Repair and my poor Father and Mother have only to wish that they and  I may be deserving of half the Goodness we experience from the bountiful Mind of your good Brother  But indeed my Lady I have the Pleasure of discovering every Day more and more that there is not a better dispos'd and more generous Gentleman in the World than himself insomuch that I verily think he has not been so careful to conceal his  bad  Actions as his  good  ones His Heart is naturally beneficent and his Beneficence is the Gift of God to him as I have been so free as to tell him to serve for excellent Purposes even for a Foundation to the noblest Superstructure whenever the Rubbish of Sense shall be clear'd from it and the Divine Workmen be properly employ'd to build a Temple for the Deity to reside in Pardon me my dear Lady I wish I may not be impertinently grave But I find a great many Instances of his considerate Charity which hardly any body knew of and which since I have been his Almoner could not avoid coming to my Knowlege But this possibly is no News to your Ladyship Every body knows the generous Goodness of your own Heart Every one that wanted Relief tasted the Bounty of your excellent Mother my late honour'd Lady So that 'tis a  Family Grace  and I have no need to speak of it to you Madam  This cannot my dear Lady I hope be construed as if I would hereby suppose ourselves less oblig'd Indeed I know nothing so Godlike in Human Nature as this Disposition to do Good to our FellowCreatures for is it not following immediately the Example of that gracious Providence which every Minute is conferring Blessings on us all and by giving Power to the Rich makes them but the Dispensers of its Benefits to those that want them But yet as there are but too many Objects of Compassion and as the most beneficent Mind in the World cannot  like Omnipotence do Good to all how much are they oblig'd who are distinguished from others And this kept in Mind will always contribute to make the Benefited receive as they ought the Favours of the Obliger  I know not if I write to be understood in all I mean but my grateful Heart is so overfill'd when it is imploy'd on this Subject that methinks I want to say a great deal more at the same time that I am apprehensive I say too much Yet perhaps the Copies of the Letters I here inclose to your Ladyship that mark'd I written by me to my Father and Mother on our Return hither from  Kent  that mark'd II from my dear Father in Answer to it and that mark'd III mine in Reply to his  See Letters    of this Volume  will at the same time that they may convince your Ladyship that I will conceal nothing from you in the Course of this Correspondence that may in the least amuse and divert you or that may better explain our grateful Sentiments in a great measure answer what your Ladyship expects from me as to the happy Fortnight we pass'd in  Kent    And here I will conclude this Letter chusing to suspend the Correspondence till I know from your Ladyship whether it will not be too low too idle for your Attention whether you will not dispense with your own Commands for my writing to you when you see it is so little likely to answer what you may possibly expect from me or whether if you insist upon my scribbling you would have me write in any other Way be less tedious less serious in short less or more any thing For all that is in my Power your Ladyship may command from  Madam  Your obliged and faithful Servant  P B  Your dearest Brother from whose Knowlege I would not keep any thing that shall take up any considerable Portion of my Time gives me Leave to proceed in this Correspondence if you command it and is pleas'd to say He will content himself to see such Parts of it and  only  such Parts as I shall shew him or read to him Is not this very good Madam O my Lady you don't know how happy I am  LETTER XII  My dear  Pamela  YOU very much oblige me by your chearful Compliance with my Request I leave it intirely to you to write in what Manner you please and as you shall be in the Humour to write when you take up your Pen for then I shall have you write with less Restraint For you must know that what we admire in you are Truth and Nature and not studied or elaborate Sentiments We can hear at Church or we can read in our Closets fifty good Things that we expect not from you but we cannot receive from any body else the Pleasure of Sentiments flowing with that artless Ease which so much affects us when we read your Letters Then my sweet Girl your Gratitude your Prudence your Integrity of Heart your Humility shine so much in all your Letters and Sentiments that no Wonder my Brother loves you as he does But I shall make you proud I doubt and so by Praise ruin those Graces which we admire and but for that cannot praise too much In my Conscience if thou canst hold as thou hast begun I believe thou wilt have him  all to thyself  and that was once more than I thought ever any Woman  on this Side the Seventieth Year of his Age would ever be able to say The Letters to and from your Parents we are charm'd with and the communicating of them to me I take to be as great an Instance of your Confidence in me as it is of your Judgment and Prudence for you cannot but think that we his Relations are a little watchful over your Conduct and have our Eyes upon you to observe what Use you are likely to make of the Power you have over your Man with respect to your own Relations  Hitherto all is unexampled Prudence and you take the right Method to reconcile even the proudest of us to your Marriage and make us not only love you but respect your Parents because their Honesty will I perceive be their distinguishing Character and they will not forget themselves nor their former Condition  I can tell you you are exactly right for if you were to be an  Incroacher  as the good old Man calls it my Brother would be one of the first to see it and he would gradually think less and less of you till possibly he might come to despise you and to repent of his Choice For the least Shadow of an Imposition or low Cunning or mean Selfishness he cannot bear  In short you're a charming Girl and Lady  Betty  says so too and moreover adds That if he makes you not the best and  faithfullest  of Husbands he cannot deserve you for all his Fortune and Birth And in my Heart I begin to think so too  But won't you oblige me with the Sequel of your Letter to your Father for you promise my dear charming Scribbler in that you sent to me to write again to his Letter and I long to see how you answer the latter Part of it about your Relations desiring already to come and live with him I know what I  expect  from you But let it be what it will send it to me exactly as you wrote it and I shall see whether I have Reason to praise or to reprove you For surely  Pamela  you must leave one Room to blame you for something Indeed I can hardly bear the Thought that you should so much excel as you do and have more Prudence by Intuition as it were than the best of us have in a Series of the genteelest Education and with fifty Advantages at least in Conversation that  you  could not have by reason of my Mother's retired Life while you were with her and your close Attendance on her Person  But I'll tell you what has been a great Improvement to you It is your own Writings This Itch of Scribbling has been a charming Help to you For here having a natural Fund of good Sense and a Prudence above your Years you have with the Observations those Advantages have inabled you to make been Flint and Steel too as I may say to yourself So that you have struck  Fire  when you pleas'd wanting nothing but a few dry'd Leaves like the first Pair in old  Du Bartas  to serve as Tinder to catch your animating Sparks So that reading constantly and thus using yourself to write which impress'd you more than Reading could and enjoying besides the Benefit of a good Memory every thing you heard or read became your own and not only so but improved by passing thro' more salubrious Ducts and Vehicles like some fine Fruit grafted upon a common Freestock whose more exuberant Juices serve to bring to quicker and greater Perfection the downy Peach or the smooth Nectarine with its crimson Blush  Really  Pamela  I believe I too shall improve by writing to you Why you dear Saucyface at this Rate you'll make every one that converses with you better and wiser and  wittier  too as far as I  know than they ever before thought there was  Room  for 'em to be  As to my own Part I begin to like what I have written myself I think and your Correspondence will possibly make me resume the poetical Ideas that used to be strong upon me before I entered into the drowsy married Life for my good Lord  Davers  's Turn happens not to be to Books and so by Degrees my Imagination was in a manner quench'd and I as a dutiful Wife should endeavour'd to form my Taste by that of the Man I chose  But after all  Pamela  you are not to be a little proud I can tell you that of my Correspondence and I could not have thought it e'er would have come to this But you'll have the Penetration to observe that I am the more free and unreserved to encourage  you  to write without Restraint For already you have made us a Family of Writers and Readers so that Lord  Davers  himself is become inamour'd of your Letters and desires of all things he may hear read every one that passes between us Nay  Jackey  for that matter who was the most thoughtless whistling sauntering Fellow you ever knew and whose Delight in a Book ran no higher than a Song or a Catch now comes in with an inquiring Face and vows he'll set Pen to Paper and turn Letterwriter himself and intends if my Brother won't take it amiss he says to begin to  you  provided he could be sure of an Answer  I have twenty Things still to say for you have unlocked all our Bosoms And yet I intended not to write above ten or a dozen Lines when I began only to tell you that I would have you take your own Way in your Subjects and in your Style And if you will but give me Hope that you are in the Way I so much wish to have you in I will then call myself  your affectionate Sister but till then it shall only barely be  Your Correspondent  DAVERS  You'll proceed with the Account of your  Kentish  Affair I doubt not  LETTER XIII  My dear good Lady  WHAT kind what generous things are you pleased to say of your happy Correspondent And what Reason have I to value myself on such an Advantage as is now before me if I am capable of improving it as I ought from a Correspondence with so noble and so admired a Lady I wish I be not now proud indeed To be praised by such a Genius and by the noble Sister of my honoured Benefactor whose Favour next to his own it was always my chief Ambition to obtain is what would be enough to fill with Vanity a steadier and a more equal Mind than mine  I have heard from my late honoured Lady what a fine Pen her beloved Daughter was Mistress of when she pleased to take it up But I never could have had the Presumption but from your Ladyship's own Motion to hope to be in any manner the Subject of it much less to be called your Correspondent  Indeed Madam I  am  proud  very  proud of this Honour and consider it as such a Heightening to my Pleasures as only  that  could give and I will set about obeying your Ladyship without Reserve  But permit me in the first Place to disclaim any Merit from my own poor Writings to that Improvement  which your Goodness imputes to me What I have to boast of that Sort is owing principally if it deserves Commendation to my late excellent Lady It is hardly to be imagined what Pains her Ladyship took with her poor Servant Besides makeing me keep a Book of her Charities dispensed by my Hands she caused me always to set down in my Way the Cases of the Distressed their Griefs from their Misfortunes and their Joys in her bountiful Relief and so I was enter'd early into the various Turns that affected worthy Hearts and was taught the better to regulate my own especially by the Help of the fine Observations which my good Lady used to make to me when I read to her what I wrote For many a time has her worthy Heart run over with Pleasure at my Remarks and with Praises and I was her good Girl her dear  Pamela  her hopeful Maiden and she would sometimes snatch my Hand with Transport and draw me to her and vouchsafe to kiss me and always was saying what she would do for me if God spared her and I continued to be deserving  O my dear Lady you cannot think what an Encouragement this condescending Behaviour and Goodness was to me Indeed Madam you  cannot  think it  I used to throw myself at her Feet and embrace her Knees and my Eyes streaming with Tears of Joy would often cry O continue to me my dearest Lady the Blessing of your Favour and kind Instructions and it is all your happy happy  Pamela  can wish for  But I will proceed to obey your Ladyship and write with as much Freedom as I possibly  can  For you must not expect that I can be intirely divested of that Awe which will lay me under more Restraint than if I was writing to my Father and Mother  whose Partiality for their Daughter made me in a manner secure of their good Opinions  And now that I may shorten the Work before me in the Account I am to give of the sweet Fortnight that we passed in  Kent  I inclose not only the Copy of the Letter your Ladyship desired me to send you but my Father's Answer to it which with those you have already will set before your Ladyship all you want to see in relation to the Desire some of my Kindred had to live with my Father and my own Advice on the Occasion And I am humbly confident you will join in Sentiment with me For Persons are less doubtful of Approbation when their Minds are incapable of dark Reserves or such Views as they would be afraid should be detected by the most watchful Observer of their Conduct And your Ladyship gives me double Pleasure that you are pleased to have an Eye upon mine first Because I hope it will be such as will generally bear the strictest Scrutiny and next Because when my Actions fall short of my Intentions I presume to hope your Ladyship will be as kind a Monitor to me as you are a Correspondent and then I shall have an Opportunity to correct myself and be as near as my slender Talents will permit what your Ladyship would have me to be  As the Letters I sent before and those I now send will let your Ladyship into several Particulars such as a brief Description of the House and Farm and your honoured Brother's Intentions of retiring thither nowandthen of the Happiness and Gratitude of my dear Parents and their Wishes to be able to deserve the Comforts his Goodness has heaped upon them and that in stronger Lights than I am able to set them I will only in a summary manner mention the rest And particularly  That the Behaviour of my dear Benefactor to me to my Parents to Mr  Longman  and to the Tenants was one continued Series of Benignity and Condescension He endeavoured in every kind and generous way to encourage the good Couple to be free and chearful with him and seeing them unable to get over that Awe and Respect which they owe him above all Mankind and which they sought to pay him on all Occasions he would take their Hands and move than once called them by the nearest and dearest Names of Relationship as if they were his own Parents and I believe would have distinguish'd them oftener in this manner but that he saw them too much affected with his Goodness to bear the Honour as my dear Father says in his first Letter with  Equalness of Temper  and he seemed always to delight in being particularly kind to them before Strangers and before the Tenants and before Mr  Sorby  and Mr  Bennet  and Mr  Shepherd  three of the principal Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood who with their Ladies came to visit us and whose Visits we  all  returned for your dear Brother would not permit my Father and Mother to decline the Invitation of those worthy Families  Judge you my dear Lady with what a Joy these kind Distinctions and this sweet Behaviour must fill their honest Hearts Judge of my grateful Sentiments and Acknowlegements on these hourly Instances of his Goodness and judge of the Respect and Esteem with which this must inspire every one to the good Couple And when once Mrs  Bennet  had like to have said something of their former Condition which she would have recalled in some Confusion and when she could not apologized for it the dear Gentleman said All is well Mrs  Bennet  No Apologies are necessary and to shew you they are not I'll tell you myself what you cannot have heard  so particularly from others and which were I to endeavour to conceal would be a Piece of Pride as stupid as despicable So in a concise manner he gave them an Account of my Story so much to my Advantage and so little to his own in the ingenuous Relation of his Attempts upon me that you can't imagine Madam how much the Gentry were affected by it and how much in particular they applauded him for the Generosity of his Actions to me and to my dear Parents And your Ladyship will permit me to observe that since the Matter is circumstanced as it is Policy as well as Nobleness of Mind obliged from the dear Gentleman this Frankness and Acknowlegement for having said  worse  of himself and as mean of our Fortunes as they could think what remained for the Hearers but to  applaud  when he had left them no Room to  reproach  not so much as in Thought  Every Day we rode out or walked a little about the Grounds and while we were there he employ'd Hands to cut a Vista thro' a Coppice as they call it but rather a little Wood to a rising Ground which fronting an oldfashion'd Balcony in the Middle of the House he ordered it to be planted like a Grove and a little Building to be erected on its Summit in the Fashion of an antient  Greek  Temple of which he has sent them a Draught drawn by his own Hand from one he had seen Abroad and this and a few other Alterations mentioned in my Letter to my Father are to be finished against we go down next  The dear Gentleman was every Hour pressing me while there to take one Diversion or other frequently upbraiding me that I seemed not to chuse any thing urging me to propose sometimes what I could  wish  he should oblige me in and not always to leave it to him to chuse for me saying he was halfafraid that my  constant Compliance with every thing he proposed laid me sometimes under a Restraint and he would have me have a Will of my own since it was impossible that it could be such as he should not take a Delight in conforming to it  But when as I told him his Favour for me made him rather study what was obliging to me than himself and that he prevented all my Wishes by his Goodness how was it possible for me not to receive with Pleasure and Gratitude every Intimation from him in such a manner as that tho' it might seem to be the Effect of an implicit Obedience to his Will yet was it nor could it be otherwise intirely my own  I will not trouble your Ladyship with any further Particulars relating to this happy Fortnight which was made up all of white and unclouded Days to the very last and your Ladyship will judge better than I can describe what a Parting there was between my dear Parents and their honoured Benefactor and me  We set out attended with the good Wishes of Crouds of Persons of all Degrees for your dear Brother left behind him noble Instances of his Bounty it being the  first  Time as he bid Mr  Longman  say that he had been down among them since that Estate had been in his Hands  But permit me Madam to observe that I could not forbear often very often in this happy Period thanking God in private for the blessed Terms upon which I was there to what I should have been had I gracelesly accepted of those which once were tender'd to me for your Ladyship will remember that the  Kentish  Estate was to be Part of the Purchace of my Infamy  See  Vol I  p      We return'd thro'  London  again by the like easy Journeys but tarry'd not to see any thing of that vast Metropolis any more than we did in going through it before your beloved Brother only stopping at his Banker's and desiring him to look out for a handsome House which he purposes to take for his Winter Residence He chuses it to be about  SohoSquare  or the new Buildings called  HanoverSquare  and he left Mr  Longman  there to see one which his Banker believed would be fit for him  And thus my dear good Lady I have answer'd your first Commands by the Help of the Letters which passed between my dear Parents and me and conclude this with the Assurance that I am with high Respect  Your Ladyship's most obliged and faithful Servant  P B  LETTER XIV  My dearest Lady  I Now set myself to obey your Ladyship's second Command which is To give an Account in what manner your dear Brother broke to me the Affair of the unfortunate Miss  Godfrey  with my Behaviour upon it And this I cannot do better than by transcribing the Relation I gave at the Time in those Letters to my dear Parents which your Ladyship has not seen in these very Words  See Vol II  p  beginning  My dear Mr  B down to  p    Line    Thus far my dear Lady the Relation I gave to my Parents at the Time of my being first acquainted with this melancholy Affair  It is a great Pleasure to me that I can already flatter myself from the Hints you kindly give me that I behaved as you wished I should behave Indeed Madam I could not help it for I pitied most sincerely the unhappy Lady and tho' I could not but rejoice that I had had the Grace to escape the dangerous Attempts of the dear Intriguer yet never did the Story of any unfortunate Lady make such an Impression upon me as hers did She loved  him  and believed no doubt he loved  her  too well to take ungenerous Advantages of her soft Passion for him and so by Degrees put herself in his Power and too seldom alas have the noblestminded of the seduceing Sex the Mercy or the Goodness to spare the poor Creatures that doAnd then this Love to be sure is a sad Thing when once it is suffer'd to reign A perfect Tyrantrequiring an unconditional Obedience to its arbitrary Dictates and deeming every Instance of Discretion and Prudence and Virtue itself too often but as so many Acts of Rebellion to its usurped Authority  And then how do even Blemishes become Perfections in those we love Crimes themselves too often to inconsiderate Minds appear but as human Failings and human Failings are a  common Cause  and always pardonable by human Frailty  Then 'tis another Misfortune of People in Love they always think highly of the beloved Object and lowly of themselves such a dismal Mortifier is Love  I say not this Madam to excuse the poor Lady's Fall Nothing can do that because Virtue is and ought to be preferable to all Considerations and to Life itself But methinks I love this dear Lady so well for the sake of her edifying Penitence that I would fain extenuate her Crime if I could and the rather as in all Probability it was a  first Love  on  both  Sides and so he could not appear to her as a  practised  Deceiver  Your Ladyship will see by what I have transcribed how I behaved myself to the dear Miss  Goodwin  and I am so fond of the little Charmer as well for the sake of her unhappy Mother tho' personally unknown to me as for the Relation she bears to the dear Gentleman whom I am bound to love and honour that I must beg your Ladyship's Interest to procure her to be given up to my Care when it shall be thought proper I am sure I shall act by her as tenderly as if I was her own Mother And glad I am that the poor unfaulty Baby is so justly beloved by Mr  B  But I will here conclude this Letter with assuring your Ladyship that I am  Your obliged and humble Servant  P B  LETTER XV  My good Lady  I Now come to your Ladyship's Remarks on my Conduct to Mrs  Jewkes  which you are pleased to think too kind and forgiving considering the poor Woman's Baseness  Your Ladyship says  "That I ought not to have borne her in my Sight after the impudent Assistance she gave to his lewd Attempts much less to have left her in her Place and rewarded her for her Vileness"  Alas my dear Lady what could I do a poor Prisoner as I was made for Weeks together in Breach of all the Laws of Civil Society not a Soul who durst be my Friend and  every Day expecting to be ruin'd and undone by one of the haughtiest and most determin'd Spirits in  England  And when it pleased GOD to turn his Heart and incline him to abandon his wicked Attempts and to profess honourable Love to me his poor Servant can it be thought I was to insist upon Conditions with such a Gentleman who had me in his Power and who if I had provoked him might have resumed all his wicked Purposes against me  Indeed I was too much overjoy'd after all my Dangers past which were so great that I could not go to Rest nor rise but with such Apprehensions that I wish'd for Death rather than Life to think of refusing any Terms that I could yield to and keep my Honour  And tho' such noble Ladies as your Ladyship and Lady  Betty  who are born to Independency and are hereditarily as I may say on a Foot with the highestdescended Gentleman in the Land might have exerted Spirit and would have had a Right to pick and chuse your own Servants and distribute Rewards and Punishments to the Deserving and Undeserving at your own good Pleasure yet what had I a poor Girl who ow'd my Title even to common Notice to the Bounty of my late good Lady and a kind of imputed Sightliness of Person which had made me only the Subject of vile Attempts who from a Situation of Terror and Apprehension was lifted up to a Hope beyond my highest Ambition and was bid to pardon the bad Woman as an Instance that I could forgive his own hard Usage of me who had experienced so often the Violence and Impetuosity of his Temper which even his beloved Mother never resisted till it subsided and then indeed he was all Goodness and Acknowlegement of which I could give your Ladyship  more than one Instance what I say had I to do to take upon me LadyAirs and resent  But my dear Ladies let me in this Instance bespeak both your Ladyships Attention I should be inexcusable if I did not tell you all the Truth and that is that I not only forgave the poor Wretch in regard to  his Commands  but from  my own Inclination    If I am wrong in saying this I must submit it to your Ladyships and as I pretend not to Perfection am ready to take the Blame I shall be found to deserve in your Ladyships Judgment but indeed were it to do again I verily think I could not help forgiving her And were I not able to say this I should be thought to have made a mean Court to my Master's Passions and to have done a wrong thing with my Eyes open▪ Which I humbly conceive no one should do  When this poor Creature was put into my Power seemingly at least tho' it might possibly have been resum'd and I might have been recommitted to hers had I given him Reason to think I made an arrogant Use of it you cannot imagine what a Triumph I had in my Mind on the mortify'd Guilt which from the highest Degree of Insolence and Imperiousness that before harden'd her masculine Features appear'd in her Countenance when she found the Tables likely to be soon turn'd upon her  This Change of Behaviour which at first operated in sullen Awe and afterwards in a kind of silent Respect shew'd me what an Influence Power had over her and that when she could treat her late Prisoner when taken into Favour so obsequiously it was the less Wonder the bad Woman could think it her Duty to obey Commands so unjust when her Obedience to them was required from her Master  To be sure if a Look could have killed her after some of her bad Treatment she had been slain over  and over as I may say But to me who always was taught to distinguish between the Person and the Action I could not hold my Resentment against the poor passive Machine of Mischief one Day together tho' her Actions were so odious to me  I should indeed except that Time of my grand Trial when she appear'd so much a Wretch to me that I saw her not even after  See  Vol I  p    two Days that she was kept from my Sight without great Flutter and Emotion of Heart and I had represented to your Brother before how hard a Condition it was for me to forgive so much unwomanly Wickedness  Ibid  p      But my dear Ladies when I consider'd the Matter in  one  particular Light I could the more easily forgive her and  having  forgiven her  bear her in my Sight  and act by her as a Consequence of that Forgiveness as if she had not so horridly offended Else how would it have been Forgiveness Especially as she was ashamed of her Crime and there was no Fear of a Repetition of it  Thus then I thought on the Occasion Poor wretched Agent for Purposes little less than infernal I  will  forgive thee since  thy  Master and  my  Master will have it so And indeed thou art beneath the Resentment even of such a poor Girl as I I will  pity  thee base and abject as thou art And she who is the Object of my  Pity  is surely beneath my  Anger  My Eye that used to quiver and tremble at thy haughty Eye shall now with conscious Worthiness take a superior Steadiness and look down thy scouling guilty one into SelfCondemnation the State thou couldst never cast mine into nor from it wilt be able to raise thine own Bear the Reproach of thy own wicked Heart low vile  Woman unworthy as thou art of the  Name  and chosen as it should seem for a Foil to the Innocent and to make Purity shine forth the brighter the  only  good Use such Wretches as thou can be of to others except for Examples of Penitence and Mercy This will be Punishment enough for thee without my exposing myself to the Imputation of descending so near to a Level with thee as to resent thy Baseness when thou hast no Power to hurt me  Such were then my Thoughts my proud Thoughts so far was I in my Heart and I hoped in the very Act that proceeded from that Heart from  intentional  Meanness in forgiving at Mr  B  's Interposition the poor low creeping abject  Self  mortify'd and  Master  mortify'd Mrs  Jewkes    And do you think Ladies when you revolve in your Thoughts  who  I was and  what  I was and what I was designed to be when you revolve the amazing Turn in my Favour and the Prospects before me Prospect so much above my Hope that I left them intirely to Providence to direct for me as it pleased without daring to look forward to what those Prospect seemed naturally to tend when I could see my haughty Persecutor become my repentant Protector the lofty Spirit that used to make me tremble and to which I never could look up without Awe except in those animating Cases where his Guilt and my Innocence gave me a Courage more than natural to my otherwise dastardly Heart When this impetuous Spirit could stoop to request one whom he had sunk beneath even her usual low Character of his Servant and was his Prisoner under Sentence of a Ruin worse than Death as he had intended it and had seized her for that very Purpose could stoop to acknowledge the Vileness of those Purposes Could say  at one time  "That my Forgiveness of Mrs  Jewkes  should stand me in greater Stead than I was aware of"  Could tell her before me  "That she must for the future shew me all the Respect that was due to one he must love  See  Vol I  p    "  At another acknowlege before her  "That he had been stark naught and that I was very forgiving  Vol II  p    "  Again  Ibid  p    to Mrs  Jewkes  putting himself on a Level with her as to Guilt  "We are both in generous Hands and indeed if  Pamela  did not pardon  you  I should think she but half forgave  me  because you acted by my Instructions"  Another time to the same  Ibid  p      "We have been both Sinners and must be both included in one Act of Grace"  When I say I was thus lifted up to the State of a sovereign Forgiver and my lordly Master became a Petitioner for himself and for the guilty Creature whom he put under my Feet what a Triumph was here for the poor  Pamela  And could I have been guilty of so mean a Pride as to trample upon the poor abject Creature when I found her thus lowly thus mortify'd and so much in my Power For so she actually was while I seemed to think so And would it have been good Manners with regard to my Master or Policy with respect to mayself to doubt it after he had so declared  Then my dear Ladies while I was injoying the Soulcharming Fruits of that Innocence which the Divine Grace had inabled me to preserve in spite of so many Plots and Contrivances on my  Master  's Side and such wicked Instigations and Assistances on hers and all my Prospects were improving upon me beyond my Wishes when all was Sunshine unclouded Sunshine and I possessed my Mind in  Peace and had nothing to do but to be thankful to Providence which had been so gracious to my Unworthiness when I saw as I said above my Persecutor become my Protector my active Enemy no longer my Enemy but creeping with flow doubtful Feet and speaking to me with awful hesitating Doubt of my Acceptation a Stamp of an insolent Foot turned into court'fying halfbent Knees threatening Hands into supplicating Folds and the Eye unpitying to Innocence running over with the Sense of her own Guilt a faltering Accent on her late menacing Tongue and uplifted Handkerchief  "I see she will be my Lady And then I know how it will go with me  See  Vol I  p    "  Was not this my Ladies a Triumph of Triumphs to the late miserable now exalted  Pamela  Could I do less than pardon her And having declared that I did so was I not to shew the Sincerity of my Declaration  Indeed indeed my dear good Ladies I found such a Subject for Exultation in this providential Change of my Condition that I had much ado to subdue my rising Pride and thought there was more Danger of being lifted up every Moment to see such improving Contrition on the poor Creature's Part than to be supposed guilty of a Meanness of Heart in  stooping  yes Madam that was then the proudly proper Word in the Elevation wherein I found myself to forgive her And what should I not forgive a Creature for that very Baseness which happily withstood had so largely contributed to exalt me Indeed my dear good Ladies permit me to repeat I could not chuse but to forgive her How could IAnd would it not have been out of Character in me and against all  Expectation of my highsoul'd tho' sometimes as in my Case for a great while together meanlyacting Master if I had not  Would it not have shewn him that the lowborn  Pamela  was incapable of a generous Action had she refused the  only  Request her humble Condition had given her the Opportunity of granting at that time with Innocence Would he not have thought the humble Cottager as capable of Insolence and Vengeance too in her Turn as the betterborn And that she wanted but the Power to shew that unrelenting Temper by which she had so grievously suffer'dAnd might not this have given him Room to think me and to have resumed and prosecuted his Purposes accordingly fitter for an arrogant kept Mistress than an humble and obliged Wife  I see might he not have said the Girl has strong Passions and Resentments and she that has will be  acted  and sometimes  govern'd  by them I will improve upon the Hint she herself has now given me by her inexorable Temper I will gratify her Revenge till I turn it upon herself I will indulge her Pride till I make it administer to her Fall For a Wife I cannot think of in the lowborn Cottager especially when she has lurking in her all the Pride and Arrogance you know my Ladies his haughty way of speaking of our Sex of the betterdescended And by a little Perseverance and watching her unguarded Hours and applying Temptations to her Passions I shall first discover them and then make my Advantage of them  Might not this have been the Language and this the Resolution of such a dear wicked Intriguer For my Lady you can hardly conceive the Struggles he apparently had to bring down his high Spirit  to so humble a Level And tho' I hope all would have been even in this  worst  Case ineffectual thro' Divine Grace yet how do I know what lurking Vileness might have appeared by Degrees in this frail Heart to have incouraged his Designs and to have augmented my Trials and my Dangers And perhaps downright Violence might have been used if he could not on one hand have subdu'd his Passion nor on the other have overcome his Pride A Pride that every one reflecting upon the Disparity of Birth and Condition between us would have dignify'd with the Name of  Decency  a Pride that was become such an essential Part of the dear Gentleman's Character in this Instance of a Wife that altho' he knew he could not keep it up if he made  me  happy yet it was no small Motive in his chusing me in one respect because he expected from me more Humility more Submission than he thought he had Reason to flatter himself would be paid him by a Lady equally born and educated And of this I will send your Ladyship an Instance in a Transcription from that Part of  See  Vol II  p    seq  beginning at Line  my Journal you have not seen of his Lessons to me on the Occasion your Ladyship so well remembers of my incurring his Displeasure by interposing between yourself and him  Ibid  p    in your Misunderstanding at the Hall for Madam I intend to send at times any thing I think worthy of your Ladyship's Attention out of those Papers you were so kind as to excuse me from sending you in the Lump and many of which must needs have appeared very impertinent to such Judges  Thus could your Ladyship have thought it have I ventur'd upon a strange Paradox that even  this strongest Instance of his Debasing himself is not the weakest Instance of his Pride and he ventured once at Sir  Simon Darnford  's to say in your Ladyship's Hearing as you may remember that in his Conscience he thought he should hardly have made a tolerable Husband to any body but  Pamela  See  Vol II  p  Vol III  And why For the Reasons you will see in the inclosed Papers which give an Account of the noblest and earliest Curtainlecture that ever Girl had One of which is That he expects to be  borne  with  comply'd  with he meant even when in the wrong Another That a Wife should never so much as expostulate with him tho' he  was  in the wrong till by complying with all he insisted upon she should have shewn him she designed rather to convince him for his  own  sake than for  Contradiction  's sake And then another time perhaps he might take better Resolutions  Ibid p      I hope from what I have said it will appear to your Ladyship and to Lady  Betty  too that I am justify'd or at least excusable in pardoning Mrs  Jewkes  And I have yet another Reason behind for doing so had she been as absolutely in my Power as the Wish of the most resenting Person in the World could have made her and that is the Hope I had that the poor Creature by being continued in a Family where the Gentleman gave Hopes of so desireable a Reformation and where the Example of the Person he was about to honour in so eminent a Degree beyond all that could have been hoped for by her a few Days before might possibly contribute to make her change her Manner of Thinking as well as Acting  I looked upon the poor Wretch in all her Deportment to me in my Days of Trial as one devoted to Perdition by her own Act and Deed as one who  had no Regard to a future State and who while she could live in Ease and Plenty for a wretched poor Term of Years the Remainder of an illspent Life cared not what she did and was ready to undertake any thing which Persons of Power and Riches would put her upon That even were she to be turned off disgracefully at my Desire besides shewing myself to be of an implacable Spirit which some People would have imputed to right some to wrong Motives as they favoured me or not she might be entertained by some prostigate Persons to whose Baseness such a Woman might be useful and that then her Power to do Mischief might be augmented and she might go on more successfully to do the Devil' Work and several innocent Creatures might be intangled like so many thoughtless Flies in the insnaring Web of this venomoushearted Spider which I had so happily escaped Is it not better then thought I if I can impress  Conviction  upon the poor Wretch whom its hopeful Forerunner  Shame  had already taken hold of and add the delightful Hope of Mischiefs prevented to that of a Soul reclaimed And may not I who have been so hardly used by her for  that  very Reason have more Influence upon her than any other Person even the best of Divines could have When  I  talk to her in a virtuous Way will she not see that I talk from  Example  pardon my Presumption Madam in saying so as well as  Precept  Will she not see that those Principles must proceed from a right Direction a Direction  worthy  of being followed which could make a Sufferer by her forgive as readily as she could err and in Hopes of reclaiming her to the Paths of Virtue forget that she was either her Enemy or her Superior tho' the one she had Reason to apprehend and the other she saw I was become  Nay would not this Behaviour of mine very probably operate on a much higher and nobler Subject her dear naughty Master and let  him  see the Force and Amiableness of a virtuous Habit that there must be something in those Laws that could make so young a Creature pursue them in an Instance so difficult to some Minds and especially to the Passionate and Highborn that of forgiving Injuries when in one's Power to resent and of returning Good for Evil  And then when no sullen Behaviour to the poor Wretch on my Side took Place no distant Airs were affected no angry Brow put on nor Sharpness of Speech to one who might expect all these from me would it not shew him that I was sincere in my Forgiveness that I was not able to bear Malice was a Stranger to Revenge had truly that Softness of Nature and Placableness of Disposition which he would wish for in a Person he thought to honour which he holds to be the greatest Merit in our Sex and which I dare say your Ladyship will join with me in Opinion is indispensably necessary for a happy Life in the Person who is his Wife  Then I have no Notion of that slight Distinction I have so often heard between  forgive  and  forget  when Persons have a mind to split Hairs and to distinguish away their Christian Duties by a Word and say I  must forgive such an Action but I will never forget it  When I would rather say  I will remember such an Action in order for my future Guard  but  I will forgive it as often as I remember it or else I will try to forget it for ever if it will occasion a Breach in my Christian Charity    After what I have said I will not name lesser Considerations such as that of my being forced to accompany with the poor Woman and my being destitute of the Company of my own Sex but of  such as were too inferior and stupid for me to take Notice of in the Prospect before me  But one thing I may mention further Might it not Ladies be right that by keeping her I should make the World think that Mr  B  had not gone such very wicked Lengths as would have been imagin'd if she had not been supportable to me in the same House Which moreover those Persons who might not know those Reasons which it was not to your dear Brother's Credit to give might have imputed to me as Arrogance or Revenge and so brought still greater Disgrace upon the Choice he had made of me as if I would take as much upon me as tho' I were to be the Obliger instead of the Obliged and who knows besides what she might have reported of both had she been dismissed  How then dearest Ladies if these Considerations have any Weight could I act otherwise than I did either with respect to your honoured Brother myself or the poor Woman And when I tell your Ladyship that I have all the Reason in the World to be pleased with this Manner of Acting in the Confidence it has given me with Mr  B  and his good Opinion of the Sincerity of my Charity and in what I was very desirous of its Effects upon the poor Woman I dare say both your Ladyships Opinions will be in my Favour on this Head  But your dear Brother has just sent me Word that Supper waits for me and the Post moreover being going off I defer till the next Opportunity what I have to say as to these good Effects and am mean time  Your Ladyships most obliged and faithful Servant  P B  LETTER XVI  My dear Lady  I WILL now acquaint you with the good Effect my Behaviour to Mrs  Jewkes  has had upon her as a further Justification of my Conduct towards the poor Woman  That she began to be affected as I wish'd appeared to me before I left the Hall not only in the Conversations I had with her after my Happiness was completed but it still appears in her general Demeanor to the Servants to the Neighbours and in her devout Behaviour at Church but still more particularly in a Letter I have received from Miss  Darnford  I dare say your Ladyship will be pleased with the Perusal of the whole Letter altho' a Part of it would answer my present Design And in Confidence that you will excuse for the sake of its other Beauties the high and undeserved Praises which Miss's Goodness makes her so lavishly to bestow upon me I will transcribe it all  From Miss  Darnford  to Mrs  B  'My dear Neighbour that was  'I Must depend upon your known Goodness to excuse me for not writing before now in Answer to your Letter of Compliment to us for the Civilities and Favours as you call them which you received from us in  Lincolnshire  where we were infinitely more obliged to you than you to us  'The Truth is my Papa has been much disordered with a kind of rambling Rheumatism to which the Physicians learnedly speaking give the Name of  Arthritica vaga  or the Flying Gout  and when he ails ever so little It signifies nothing concealing his Infirmities where they are so well known and when he cares not who knows them he is so peevish and wants so much Attendance that my Mamma and her two Girls one of which is as waspish as her Papa you may be sure I don't mean myself have much ado to make his Worship keep the Peace And I being his Favourite when he is indisposed because I have most Patience if I may give myself a good Word he calls upon me continually to read to him when he is grave which is not often indeed and to tell him S  ories and sing to him when he is merry and so I have been imploy'd as a principal Person about him till I have frequently become sad to make him chearful and happy when I could do it at any Rate For once in a Pet he flung a Book at my Head because I had not attended him for Two Hours and he could not bear to be slighted by little Bastards that was his Word that were father'd upon him for his VexationAhthought I but I durst not say itif thy Lady had been half as lively as thou hast been in thy Day my worthy Varner thou mightest have had some Reasons for the Epithet  'Forgive me dear Friend you know I'm a bold Girl▪ But I love him dearly for all that and honour him too and he knows I doand what's strange if he did not love me again would not have flung his Book at my Head O these Men Fathers or Husbands much alike the one tyrannical the other insolent so that between one and t'other a poor Girl has nothing for it but a few Weeks Cour  ship and perhaps a first Month's Bri  ry if that and then she's as much a Slave to a husband as she was a Vassal to her FatherI  mean if the Father be a Sir  Simon Darnford  and the Spouse a Mr  B  'But I will be a little more grave for a graver Occasion calls for it and yet an Occasion that will give you real Pleasure It is the very great Change that the Example you have left behind you has had upon your Housekeeper  'You desired her to keep up as much Regularity as she could among the Servants there and she is next to exemplary in it so that she has every one's good Word She speaks of her Lady not only with Respect but Reverence and calls it a blessed Day for all the Family and particularly for herself that you came into  Lincolnshire  She reads Prayers or makes one of the Servants read them every  Sunday  Night and never misses being at Church Morning and Afternoon and is preparing herself by Mr  Peters  's Advice and Direction for receiving the Sacrament which she earnestly longs to receive and says it will be the Seal of her Reformation  'Mr  Peters  gives us this Account of her and says she is full of Contrition for her past misspent Life and is often asking him If such and such Sins can be forgiven and among them names her vile Behaviour to her AngelLady as she calls you  'It seems she has written a Letter to you which passed Mr  Peters  's Revisal before she had the Courage to send it and prides herself that you have favoured her with an Answer to it which she says when she is dead will be found in a Cover of black Silk next her Heart for any thing from your Hand she is sure will be efficacious to her to make her keep her good Purposes and for that Reason she places it there And when she has any bad Thoughts or is guilty of any faulty Word or passionate Expression she recollects her Lady's  Letter and that recovers her to a Calm and puts her again into a better Frame  'As she has written to you 'tis possible I might have spar'd you the Trouble of reading this Account of her but yet you will not be displeased that so free a Liver and Speaker should have some Testimonial besides her own Assurances to vouch for the Sincerity of her Reformation  'What a happy Lady are you that Persuasion dwells upon your Tongue and Reformation follows your Example We all hear continually of your Excellencies Every body is proud of speaking of you and of having something to say of what they observe in you This makes us long more and more to see you here again My Papa t'other Day said he wish'd you'd undertake him  'This is not the least of what is admirable in you that profess'd Rakes and Libertines who take upon themselves to ridicule Seriousness in every body else speak of you with Reverence and while they attribute Pharisaical Pride or Affectation or Hypocrisy to other good Persons they say you are a Credit to Religion and that adorns you and you that  'Happy thrice happy Mrs  B  May you long live the Ornament of your Sex and a Credit to all your Acquaintance Such Examples as you set how are they wanted in an Age so depraved I fear not making you proud since Praise but puts the Worthy upon inlarging their Deservings For who as I heard you once say can sit down easy under imputed Attributes they do not deserve If they will not disclaim Praise they have not merited when apply'd to their Conduct they give an Earnest by receiving it that they will  endeavour  to do it and ought never to rest till they have made themselves a Title to it  'Happy Mr  B  But why say I so since with more Propriety I may say Happy Everyone who sees who knows who converses with Mrs  B  not more the Glory of the humble Cot than she is capable of adorning the princely Palace  'If you knew how I love you you would favour me with your Presence and Conversation if it was in your own Power to do so and then I would rank myself among the  Happies  and call myself  '  The Happy  POLLY DARNFORD'  Your Ladyship will as I said forgive me what may appear like Vanity in this Communication Miss  Darnford  is a charming young Lady I always admir'd her but her Letters are the sweetest kindest But I am too much the Subject of  their  Encomiums and so will say no more but add here the Copy of the poor Woman's Letter to me and your Ladyship will see what an ample Correspondence you have open'd to yourself if you go on to countenance it  '  Honoured Madam  'I Have been long labouring under two Difficulties the Desire I had to write to you and the Fear of being thought presumptuous if I did But I will depend on your Goodness so often try'd and put Pen to Paper in that very Closet and on that very Desk which once were so much used by your dear Self when I was acting a Part that now cuts me to the Heart to think of But you forgave me Madam and shew'd me you had too much Goodness to revoke your Forgiveness And could I have silenc'd the Reproaches of my own Heart I should have had no Cause to think I had ever offended  'But oh Madam how has your Goodness to me which once filled me with so much Gladness now on Reflection made me sorrowful and at times miserableTo think I should act so barbarously as I did by so much Sweetness and so much Forgivingness Every Place that I remember to have used you hardly in how does it now fill me with Sadness and makes me often smite my Breast and sit down with Tears and Groans bemoaning my vile Actions and my hard Heart How many Places are there in this melancholy fine House that call one thing or other to my Remembrance that gives me Remorse But the Pond and the Woodhouse whence I dragged you so mercilesly after I had driven you to Despair almost what Thoughts do they bring to my Remembrance Then my wicked Instigations What an odious Wretch was I  'Had his Honour been as abandoned as myself what a Virtue had been destroy'd between  his  Orders and  my  too rigorous Execution of them nay stretching them to shew my wicked Zeal to serve a Master that tho' I honour'd I should not as you more than once hinted to me but with no Effect at all so impenetrably wicked was my Heart have so well obey'd in his unlawful Purposes  'His Honour has made you Amends has done Justice to your Merits and so aton'd  his  Fault But as for  me  it is out of my Power ever to make Reparation All that is left me is to let your Ladyship fee that your pious Example has made such an Impression upon me that I am miserable now in the Reflection upon my past Guilt  '  You  have forgiven me and  GOD  will I hope for the Creature cannot be more merciful than  the Creator that is all my Hope Yet sometimes I dread that I am forgiven here at least not punish'd in order to be punish'd the more hereafter What will then become of the unhappy Wretch that has thus lived in a State of Sin and had so qualify'd herself by a Course of Wickedness as to be thought a proper Instrument for the worst Purposes that any one could be imploy'd in  'Good your Ladyship let not my honour'd Master see this Letter He will think I have the Boldness to reflect upon him when God knows my Heart I only write to condemn myself and my  unwomanly  Actions as you were pleased often most justly to call them  'But I might go on thus for ever accusing myself not considering who I am writing to and whose precious Time I am taking up But what I chiefly write for I am not come to yet that is to beg your Ladyship's Prayers for me For oh Madam I fear I shall else be for ever miserable We every Week hear of the Good you do and the Charity you extend to the Bodies of the Miserable Extend I beseech you good Madam to the unhappy  Jewkes  the Mercy of your Prayers and tell me if you think I have not sinned beyond Hope of Pardon for there is a Woe denounced against the presumptuous Sinner  'Your Ladyship assured me at your Departure on the Confession of my Remorse for my Misdoings and my Promise of Amendment that you would take it for a Proof of my being in Earnest if I would endeavour to keep up a Regularity among the Servants here if I would subdue them with Kindness as I had owned myself subdued and if I would endeavour to make every one  think that the best Security they could give of their doing their Duty to their Master in his  Absence  was by doing it to God Almighty whose Omniscience made him always  present  This I remember your Ladyship told me was the best Test of Fidelity and Duty that any Servants could shew since it was impossible without Religion but that worldly Convenience or SelfInterest must be the main Tye and when that failed the worst Actions might succeed if Servants thought they should find their sordid Advantage in sacrificing their Duty  'So well am I convinced of this Truth that I hope I have begun the Example to good Effect and as no one in the Family was so wicked as I and so they had less Pains to take to be reformed you will take Pleasure to know that you have now Servants here whom you need not be ashamed to call yours  'Tis true I found it a little difficult at first to keep them within Sight of their Duty after your Ladyship departed But when they saw I was in Earnest and used them courteously as you advised and as your Usage of me convinced me was the rightest Usage when they were told I had your Commands to acquaint you how they conformed to your Injunctions the Task became easy and I hope we shall all be still more and more worthy of the Favour of so good a Lady and so bountiful a Master  'I dare not presume upon the Honour of a Line to your unworthy Servant Yet it would pride me much if I could have it But I shall ever pray for your Ladyship's and his Honour's Felicity as becomes  'Your undeserving Servant  'K JEWKES'  I have already with these transcribed Letters of Miss  Darnford  and Mrs  Jewkes  written a great deal But nevertheless as there yet remains one Passage in your Ladyship's Letter relating to Mrs  Jewkes  that seems to require an Answer I will take Notice of it if I shall not quite tire your Patience  That Passage is this  "Lady  Betty  rightly observes says your Ladyship That he knew what a vile Woman she Mrs  Jewkes  was when he put you into her Power and no doubt imploy'd her because he was sure she would answer all his Purposes And that therefore she should have had very little Opinion of the Sincerity of his Reformation while he was so solicitous in keeping her there"  I make no doubt Madam that Mrs  Jewkes  was placed there as one who would be subservient to every bad Design and that this was the Reason of Mr  B  's causing me to be carried off to that House But then this was a Proof too of my hopeless Condition and of my want of Power to make his Reformation any Part of my Terms  Alas Madam I was to take him as I found him as I have already hinted glad of my own Safety and had only to hope that God and HE only could do it for neither Law nor Justice had stood in the naughty Gentleman's Way would perfect the good Work already begun in him and having first made him refrain from what he had absolutely determin'd upon would next let him see his Error and at last give him Grace to reform  But Lady  Betty  adds  "That had she been in my Case she would have had one Struggle for Mrs  Jewkes  's Dismission let it have been taken as it would and he that was so well pleased  with my Virtue must have thought this a natural Consequence of it if he was in Earnest to reclaim"  But alas Madam he was not so well pleased with my Virtue for Sake's sake as Lady  Betty  thinks he was He would have been glad at that very Time to have found me less resolved on that score He did not so much as  pretend  to be in Earnest to reclaim No not he  He had entertained as it proved a strong Passion for me This Passion had been heighten'd by  my  resisting of it His Pride and the Advantages he had both of Person and Fortune would not let him brook Controul and when he could not have me upon his own Terms God turn'd his evil Purposes to good ones and he resolved to submit to my own or rather to such as he found I would not yield to him without For all this time I had no Terms to propose Neither my low Fortunes my unjust Captivity nor my Sex nor unexperienc'd Youth not a Soul near me whom I could call my Friend or whose Advice I could ask permitted me to offer at making Terms with him had I been disposed to have disputed his Will or his Intercession for the Woman which as I have said I was not I had but one steady Purpose to adhere to and having Grace given me to adhere to that he resolved since he could not conquer his Passion for me to make me his with Honour But still I doubt as I said this was not for the Love of Virtue at that time That came afterwards and I hope will be always his governing Motive in his future Actions and then I shall be happy indeed  But Lady  Betty  thinks  "I was to blame to put Mrs  Jewkes  upon a Foot in the Present I made on my Nuptials with Mrs  Jervis  "  But the Case was rather this That I put Mrs  Jervis  on a Foot with  Mrs  Jewkes  for the dear Gentleman had  named  the Sum he would have me give Mrs  Jewkes  See  Vol II  p    and I would not give Mrs  Jervis less  because I loved her better nor  more  could I give her on that Occasion without making such a Difference between two Persons equal in Station on a Solemnity too where one was present and assisting the other not as would have shewn such a Partiality as might have induced their Master to conclude I was not so sincere in my Forgiveness as he hoped from me and as I really was  But a stronger Reason still was behind that I could in a much more agreeable manner both to Mrs  Jervis  and myself shew my Love and my Gratitude to the dear good Woman▪ And this I have taken care to do in the manner I will submit to your Ladyship at the Tribunal of whose Judgment I am willing all my Actions respecting your dear Brother shall be try'd And I hope your Ladyship will not think me a too profuse or lavish Creature I hope you won't have Reason for it Yet if you think you have pray my dear Lady don't spare me for if you shall judge me profuse in one Article I will endeavour to save it in another  But I will make what I have to say on this Head the Subject of a Letter by itself And am mean time  Your Ladyship's most obliged and obedient Servant  P B  LETTER XVII  My dear Lady  IT is needful in order to let you more intelligibly into the Subject where I left off in my last that your Ladyship should know that your generous Brother has made me his Almoner as I was my late dear Lady's and has order'd Mr  Longman  to pay me  l  See  Vol II  p    Quarterly for Purposes of which he requires no Account tho' I have one always  Ibid  p    ready to produce and he has given me other Sums to inable me to do all the Good I can to distressed Objects at my first setting out Thus inabled your Ladyship knows not how many honest Hearts I have made glad already and how many I hope to rejoice before a Year is at an End and yet come within my Limits  Now Madam as I knew Mrs  Jervis  was far from being easy in her Circumstances thinking herself obliged to pay old  Vol I  p    Debts for two extravagant Children who are both dead and maintaining in Schooling and Cloaths three of their Children which always keeps her bare I took upon me one Day as she and I sat together at our Needles to say to her as we are always running over old Stories when we are alone My good Mrs  Jervis  will you allow me to ask you after your own private Affairs and if you are tolerably easy in them  You are very good Madam said she to concern yourself about my poor Matters so much as you have to imploy your Thoughts about and so much as every Moment of your Time is taken up from the Hour you rise to the Time of your Rest  But I can with great Pleasure attribute it to your Bounty and that of my honoured Master that I am easier and easier every Day  But tell me my dear Mrs  Jervis  said I how your Matters  particularly  stand I love to mingle Concerns with my Friends and as I hide nothing from  you  I hope you'll treat  me  with equal Freedom for I always loved you and always will and nothing but Death shall divide our Friendship  She had Tears of Gratitude in her Eyes and taking off her Spectacles I cannot bear said she so much Goodness Oh my Lady  Oh my  Pamela  say reply'd IHow often must I chide you for calling me any thing but your  Pamela  when we are alone together  My Heart said she will burst with your Goodness I cannot bear it  But you  must  bear it and bear still worse Exercises to your grateful Heart I can tell you that A pretty thing truly Here I a poor helpless Girl raised from Poverty and Distress by the Generosity of the best of Gentlemen only because I was young and sightly shall put on LadyAirs to a Gentlewoman born the Wisdom of whose Years and her faithful Services and good Management make her a much greater Merit in this Family than I can pretend to have And return shall I in the Day of my Power Insult and Haughiness for the Kindness and Benevolence I received from her in that of my Indigence Indeed I won't forgive you my dear Mrs  Jervis  if I think you capable of looking upon me in any other Light than as your Daughter for you have been a Mother to me when the Absence of my own could not afford me the Comfort and good Counsel I received every Day from you  Then moving my Chair nearer her and taking her Hand and wiping with my Handkerchief in my o  her her reverend Cheek Come come my dear second Mother said I call me your Daughter your  Pamela  I have passed many sweet Hours with you under that Name And as I have but too seldom such an Opportunity as this open to me your worthy Heart and let me know if I cannot make my  second  Mother as easy and happy as our dear Master has made my  first    She hung her Head on her Shoulder and I waited till the Discharge of her Tears gave Time for Utterance to her Words provoking only her Speech by saying You used to have Three Grandchildren to provide for in Cloaths and Schooling They are all living I hope  Yes Madam they are living And your last Bounty Twenty Guineas was a great Sum and all at once made me very easy and very happy  How easy and how happy Mrs  Jervis  Why my dear Lady I paid Five to one old Creditor of my unhappy Sons Five to a second and Twoandanhalf to two others in Proportion to their respective Demands and with the other Five I paid off all Arrears of the poor Childrens Schooling and Maintenance and every one is satisfy'd and easy and all declare they will never do harsh Things by me if they are paid no more  But tell me Mrs  Jervis  what you owe in the World put all together and you and I will contrive with Justice to our best Friend to do all we can to make you quite easy for at your Time of Life I cannot bear that you shall have any thing to disturb you which I can remove and so my dear Mrs  Jervis  let me know all  Come I know your Debts dear just good Woman as you are like  David  's Sins are ever  before you So come putting my Hand in her Pocket let me be a friendly Pickpocket Let me take out your MemorandumBook and we will see how all Matters stand and what can be done Come I see you are too much moved your worthy Heart is too much affected pulling out her Book which she always has about her I will go to my Closet and return presently  So I left her to recover her Spirits and retir'd with the good Woman's Book to my Closet  Your dear Brother stepping into the Parlour just after I had gone out Where's your Lady Mrs  Jervis  said he and being told came up to me What ails the good Woman below my Dear said he I hope you and she have had no Words  No indeed Sir answer'd I If we had I am sure it would have been my Fault But I have picked her Pocket of her MemorandumBook in order to look into her private Affairs to see if I cannot with Justice to our common Benefactor make her as easy as you Sir have made my other dear Parents  A Blessing said the dear Gentleman upon my Charmer's benevolent Heart I will leave every thing to your Discretion my Dear Do all the Good you prudently can to your Mrs  Jervis    I clasped my bold Arms about him the starting Tear testifying my Gratitude Dearest dear Sir said I you affect me as much as I did Mrs  Jervis  And if any one but you had a Right to ask What ails your  Pamela  as you do What ails Mrs  Jervis  I must say I am hourly so much oppress'd by your Goodness that there is hardly any bearing one's own Joy  He saluted me and said I was a dear obliging Creature But said he I came to tell you that after we have din'd we'll take a Turn if you please  to Lady  Arthur  's She has a Family of  London  Friends for her Guests and begs I will prevail upon you to give her your Company and attend you myself only to drink Tea with her for I have told her we are to have Friends to sup with us  I will attend you Sir reply'd I most willingly altho' I doubt I am to be made a Shew of  Something like it said he For she has promis'd them this Favour  I need not dress otherwise than I am  No he was pleased to say I was always what he wished me to be  So he left me to my  good Works  those were his kind Words and I ran over Mrs  Jervis  's Accounts and found a Balance drawn of all her Matters in one Leaf in a very clear manner and a thankful Acknowlegement to God for her Master's last Bounty  "which had inabled her to give Satisfaction to others and do herself great Pleasure"  as she had written underneath  The Balance of all was  l    s  and odd Pence and I went to my Escritoire and took out  l  and down I hasted to my good Mrs  Jervis  And I said to her Here my dear good Friend is your PocketBook but are or  l  all you owe or are bound for in the World  It is Madam said she and enough too It is a great Sum but 'tis in Four Hands and they are all in pretty good Circumstances and so convinced of my Honesty that they will never trouble me for it for I have reduced the Debt every Year something since I have been in my Master's Service  Nor shall it ever be in any Body's  Power  said I to trouble you I'll tell you how we'll order it  So I sat down and made her sit down by me Here my dear Mrs  Jervis  is  l  It is not so  much to me now as the  See  Vol I  p    Two Guineas were to you that you would have given me if I would have accepted of them at my going away from this House to my Father's as I thought But I will not  give  it you neither at least at  present  as you shall hear Indeed I won't make you so uneasy as that comes to But here take this and pay the Thirtyfive Pounds odd Money to the utmost Farthing and the remaining Four Pounds odd will be a little Fund in Advance towards the Childrens Schooling And thus you shall repay it I always designed as our dear Master added Five Guineas  per Annum  to your Salary in Acknowlegement of the Pleasure he took in your Services when I was  Pamela Andrews  to add Five Pounds  per Annum  to it from the Time I became Mrs  B  But from that time for so many Years to come you shall receive no more than you did till the whole Forty Pounds be repaid And so my dear Mrs  Jervis  you won't have any Obligation to me you know but for the Advance and that is a poor Matter not to be spoken of And I will have Leave for it for fear I should die  Had your Ladyship seen the good dear Woman's Behaviour on this Occasion you would never have forgot it She could not speak Tears ran down her Cheeks in plentiful Currents her modest Hand put gently from her my offering Hand and her Bosom heav'd and she sobb'd with the painful Tumult that seem'd to struggle within her and which for some few Moments made her incapable of speaking  At last I rising and putting my Arm round her Neck and wiping her Eyes and kissing her Cheek she cry'd My dear my excellent Lady 'tis too much too much I cannot bear all thisAnd then she threw herself at my Feet for I was not  strong enough to hinder it and with uplifted Hands May God Almighty said she I kneeled by her and clasping her Hands in mine both uplifted together May God Almighty said I drowning her Voice with my louder Voice bless us both together for many happy Years and may He bless and reward the dear Gentleman who has thus inabled me to make  the Widow's Heart to sing for Joy  Dear good Woman said I rising and raising her Do you think you shall outdo me in Prayers and Praises to the Fountain of all our MerciesDo you think you shall And while I am impower'd to do Good to so many worthy Objects  abroad  shall I forget to make my dear Mrs  Jervis  happy at  home  And thus my Lady did I force upon the good Woman's Acceptance the Forty Pounds  Permit me Madam to close this Letter here and to resume the Subject in my next till when I have the Honour to be  Your Ladyship's most obliged and faithful Servant  P B  LETTER XVIII  My dear Lady  I NOW resume my last Subject where I left off that your Ladyship may have the Whole before you at one View  I went after Dinner with my dear Benefactor to Lady  Arthur  's and met with fresh Calls upon me for Humility having the too natural Effects of the Praises and prosessed Admiration of that Lady's Guests as well as my dear Mr  B  's and those  of Mr and Mrs  Arthur  to guard myself against And your good Brother was pleased to entertain me in the Chariot going and coming with an Account of the Orders he had given in relation to the  London  House which is actually taken and the Furniture he should direct for it so that I had no Opportunity to tell him what I had done in relation to Mrs  Jervis    But after Supper retiring from Company to my Closet when his Friends were gone he came up to me about our usual Bedtime He inquired kindly after my Imployment which was trying to read in the  French Telemachus  For my Lady I am learning  French  I'll assure you And who do you think is my Master Why the best I  could  have in the World your dearest Brother who is pleased to say I am no Dunce How inexcusable should I be if I was with such a Master who teaches me on his Knee and rewards me with a Kiss whenever I do well and says I have already nearly master'd the Accent and Pronunciation which he tells me is a great Difficulty got over  I requested him to render for me into  English  two or three Places that were beyond my Reach and when he had done it he asked me in  French  What I had done for Mrs  Jervis  I said Permit me Sir for I am not Proficient enough to answer you in my new Tongue in  English  to say I have made the good Woman quite happy and if I have your Approbation I shall be as much so myself in this Instance as I am in all others  I dare answer for your Prudence my Dear he was pleased to say but this is your Favourite Let me know when you have so bountiful a Heart to Strangers what you do for your Favourites  I then said Permit my bold Eye Sir to watch yours as I obey you and you know you must turn from me then or else how shall I look you in the  Face how see as I proceed whether you are displeased for you will not chide me in Words so partial have you the Goodness to be to all my Foibles  He put his Arm round my Waist and looked down nowandthen as I desired for O Madam he is all Condescension and Goodness to his unworthy yet grateful  Pamela  And I told him all I have written to your Ladyship about the Forty Pounds And now dear Sir said I half hiding my Face on his Bosom you have heard what I have done chide or beat your  Pamela  if you please It shall be all kind from you and Matter of future Direction and Caution  He raised my Head and kissed me two or three times saying Thus then I chide I beat my AngelAnd yet I have one Fault to find with you and let Mrs  Jervis  if not in Bed come up to us and hear what it is for I will  expose  you as you deserve before her My  Polly  being in Hearing attending to know if I wanted her Assistance to undress I bad her call Mrs  Jervis  And tho' I thought from his kind Looks and kind Words as well as tender Behaviour that I had not much to fear yet I was impatient to know what my Fault was for which I was so to be exposed  The good Woman came and as she enter'd with all that Modesty which is so graceful in her he moved his Chair further from me and with a set Aspect but not unpleasant said Step in Mrs  Jervis  Your Lady for so Madam he will always call me to Mrs  Jervis  and the Servants has incurred my Censure and I would not tell her in what till I had you Face to Face  She look'd surpris'd now on me now on her dear Master and I not knowing what he would say looked a little attentiveI am sorryI am very  sorry for it Sir said she court'sying low But should be more sorry if  I  were the unhappy Occasion  Why Mrs  Jervis  I can't say but it is on your Account that I must blame her  This gave us both Confusion but especially the good Woman for still I hoped much from his kind Behaviour to me just beforeAnd she said Indeed Sir I could never deserve  He interrupted her My Charge against you  Pamela  said he is that of Niggardliness and no other for I will put you both out of your Pain You ought not to have found out the Method of Repayment  The dear Creature said he to Mrs  Jervis  seldom does any thing that can be mended but I think when your good Conduct deserved an annual Acknowlegement from me in Addition to your Salary the Lady should have shewed herself no less pleased with your Service than the Gentleman Had it been for old Acquaintancesake for Sexsake she should not have given me Cause to upbraid her on this Head But I will tell you that you must look upon the Forty Pounds you have as the Effect of a just Distinction on many Accounts and your Salary from last Quarterday shall be advanced as the dear Niggard intended it some Years hence and let me only add that when my  Pamela  first begins to shew a Coldness to her Mrs  Jervis  I shall then suspect she is beginning to decline in that humble Virtue which is now peculiar to herself and makes her the Delight of all who converse with her  This was what he was pleased to  say  Thus with the most graceful Generosity and a Nobleness of Mind  truly  peculiar to himself was he pleased to  act  And what does your Ladyship think could Mrs  Jervis  or I say to him Why indeed nothing at allWe could only look upon one another with  our Eyes full and our Hearts full of a Gratitude that would not permit either of us to speak but which express'd itself at last in a Manner he was pleased to call more elegant than Words and that was with uplifted folded Hands and Tears of Joy  Oh my dear Lady how many Opportunities have the beneficent  Rich  to make  themselves  as well as their  Fellowcreatures  happy All that I could think or say or act was but my Duty before what a Sense of Obligation then must I lie under to this most generous of Men  But here let me put an End to this tedious Subject the principal Part of which can have no Excuse if it may not serve as a Proof of my chearful Compliance with your Ladyship's Commands That I recite  every  thing that is of Concern to me and with the same Freedom as I was wont to do to my dear Parents  I have done it and at the same time have offer'd what I had to plead in Behalf of my Conduct to the two Housekeepers which you expected from me and I shall therefore close this my humble Defence if I may so call it with the Assurance that I am  My dearest Lady  Your obliged and faithful Servant  P B  LETTER XIX From Lady  DAVERS  to Mrs  B  In Answer to the Six last Letters  "  WHERE she had it I can't tell but I think I never met with the Fellow of her in my Life at any Age  "  are as I remember my Brother's  Words speaking of his  Pamela  in the  Vol I  p    early Part of your Papers In Truth thou'rt a surprising Creature and every Letter we have from you we have new Subjects to admire you for Do you think Lady  Betty  said I when I had read to the End of the Subject about Mrs  Jervis  I will not soon set out to hit this charming Girl a Box of the Ear or two  For what Lady  Davers  said she  For what reply'd IWhy don't you see how many Slaps of the Face the bold Slut hits me  I'll  LADYAIRS her I will  I'll  teach her to reproach me and so many of her Betters with her Cottage Excellencies and Improvements that shame our Education  Why you dear charming  Pamela  did you only exceed me in  Words  I could forgive you for there may be a Knack and a Volubility as to  Words  that a natural Talent may supply but to be thus outdone in  Thought  and in  Deed  who can bear it and in so young an Insulter too  Well  Pamela  look to it when I see you You shall feel the Weight of my Hand orthe Pressure of my Lip one or t'other depend on it very quickly For here instead of my stooping as I had thought it would be to call  you  Sister I shall be forced to think in a little while that you ought not to own  me  as  yours  till I am nearer your Standard  But to come to Business I will summarily take Notice of the following Particulars in all your obliging Letters in order to convince you of my Friendship by the Freedom of my Observations on the Subjects you touch upon  First then I am highly pleased with what you write of the Advantages you received from the Favour of  my dear Mother and as you know many Things of her by your Attendance upon her in the last three or four Years of her Life I must desire you will give me as Opportunity shall offer all you can recollect in relation to the honoured Lady and of her Behaviour and Kindness to you and with a Retrospect to your own early Beginnings the Dawnings of this your bright Day of Excellence And this not only I but the Countess and Lady  Betty  her Sister Lady  Jenny  too with whom I am going over your Papers again request of you  I am much pleased with your  Kentish  Account tho' we wished you had been more particular in some Parts of it for we are greatly taken with your Descriptions and your Conversation Pieces Yet I own your honest Father's Letters and yours a good deal supply that  Defect  as our Pleasure in reading your Relations makes us call it Your Parents are honest discreet Folks I see that I have a Value for them And you're the prudentest Creature I ever knew in all your Ways particularly in the Advice you give them about your more distant Relations and to aim at nothing beyond their natural SphereEvery Tittle is right and as it should be On these Accounts it is that all the World will allow that you and your Parents too merit the Fortune you have met with  I am highly delighted with the Account you give me of my Brother's breaking to you the Affair of  Sally Godfrey  and your Conduct upon it 'Tis a sweet Story as he brought it on and as you relate it The Wretch has been very just in his Account of it But don't you think he was a sad young Fellow Well may you be thankful for  your  Escape well may youYour Behaviour was what I admire and so we do all but none of us think we could have imitated it in all its Parts We are in Love  with your charitable Reflections in favour of the poor Lady and the more as she certainly deserved them and a better Mother too than she had and a faithfuller Lover than she met with  You have exactly hit his Temper in your declared Love of Miss I see Child you know your Man and never fear but you'll hold him if you can go on thus to act and outdo your Sex But I should think you might as well not insist upon having Miss with you for the Girl may be pert perhaps insolent you know who is her Father you'd not care to check her for several Reasons and this may make you uneasy for if you  did  he might take it amiss let your Motives be ever so good So I think you'd better see her nowandthen at the Dairyhouse or at School than have her with you But this I leave to your own Discretion and  his  good Pleasure to determine upon for in the latter it must rest let you or me or any body say what we will  You have fully and to our Satisfaction answer'd our Objections to your Behaviour to Mrs  Jewkes  We had not considered your Circumstances quite so thoroughly as we ought to have done You are a charming Girl and all your Motives are so just that we shall be a little more cautious for the future how we censure you We are particularly pleased with the Triumphs of your Innocence over his and her Guilt and agree that they are the rightest and besttobedefended Motives for Pride that ever were set before us  In short I say with the Countess This good Girl is not without her Pride but it is the Pride that becomes and can only attend the innocent Heart and I'll warrant said her Ladyship nobody will become her Station so well as one who is capable of so worthy a Pride as this  But what a CurtainLecture hadst thou  Pamela  A noble one dost thou call it Why what a Wretch hast thou got to expect thou shouldst never expostulate against his lordly Will even when in the Wrong till thou hast obey'd it and of consequence join'd in the Evil he imposes He says indeed in  small  Points but I suppose he is to judge which are and which are not small  Thus I remember my Brother himself took Notice once of a Proposal in the House of Commons to grant the Crown a very great Sum to answer CivilList Deficiencies which being opposed by the Minority the Minister found out an Expedient that they would give the Money  first  and examine into the Merits of the Demand  afterwards  So we read that in some Countries an accused Person is put to Death and try'd afterwards and all he has to hope for while he lives is that his Relations and his own Family will be released from Obloquy if an Acquittal ensues  Much good may do you with such an Husband says Lady  Betty  Every body will  admire  you but no one will have Reason to  envy  you upon those Principles Yet I don't know how it is but this is evident that at present there is not a happier Couple in the World than you two are  I am pleased with your Promise of sending me what you think I shall like to see out of those Papers you chuse not to shew me collectedly This is very obliging You're a good Girl and I love you dearly  We have all smiled at your Paradox  Pamela  that his marrying  you  was an Instance of his Pride The Thought tho' is pretty enough and ingenious But whether it will hold or not I won't just now examine  Your Observation on the  Forget  and  Forgive  we are much pleased with and think you have distinguished well on that Head  You are a very good Girl for sending me a Copy of Miss  Darnford  's Letter She is a charming young Lady I always had a great Opinion of her Merit her Letter abundantly confirms me in it I hope you'll communicate to me every Letter that passes between you and pray send me in your next a Copy of your Answer to her Letter I must insist upon it I think  I am glad with all my Heart to hear of poor  Jewkes  's Reformation Your Example carries all before it But pray oblige me with your Answer to her Letter Don't think me unreasonable 'Tis all for your sake You must needs know that or you know nothing For I think you deserve all Miss  Darnford  says of you and that's a great deal too  Prayhave you shewn  Jewkes  's Letter to your good Friend Lady  Betty  wan  s to know if you  have  what he could say to it for she says it cuts him to the Quick and I think so too if he takes it as he ought But as you say he's above loving Virtue for  Virtue's sake  I warrant him He likes it in a Wife because 'tis a Husband's Security against the  Lex Talionis  There's a great deal in that I can tell you I once heard the Wretch hold an Argument that Women had no Souls I asked him If he was to marry whether he'd have his Wife  act  as if she believ'd this Doctrine to be good That was another thing he said He was for having his Wife think she had he must own Such a Belief could do her no Harm Ah  Pamela  Theory and Practice never was such a Rake for one not quite a Town Debauchee  Your Manner of Acting by Mrs  Jervis  with so handsome a Regard to my Brother's Interest her  Behaviour upon it and your Relation of the Whole and of his generous Spirit in approving reproving and improving your prudent Generosity make no inconsiderable Figure in your Papers And Lady  Betty  says Hang him he has some excellent Qualities tooIt is impossible not to think well of him and his good Actions go a great way towards atoneing for his bad But you  Pamela  have the Glory of all We desire particularly that you will never omit any of those moving Scenes which you so well describe be the Occasion what it will For they are Nature and that's your Excellence Keep to that for one more learned I verily think could not write as you do nor instruct and delight and  move  all at once so very ingagingly  I am glad you are learning  French  Thou art a happy Girl in thy Teacher and he is a happy Man in his Scholar We are pleased with the pretty Account you give us of his Method of Instructing and Rewarding 'Twould be strange if you did not learn any Language quickly under such Methods and with such Encouragements from the Man you love were your Genius less apt than it is But we wish'd you had inlarged on that Subject For such Fondness of Men to their Wives who have been any time marry'd is so rare and so unexpected from my Brother that we thought you should have written a Side upon that Subject at least  What a bewitching Girl art thou What an Exemplar to Wives now as well as thou wast before to Maidens Thou canst tame Lions I dare say if thou'dst tryReclaim a Rake in the Meridian of his Libertinism and make such an one as my Brother not only marry thee but love thee better at several Months End than he did the first Day if possible Wonderful Girl Yet usest thou no Arts but honest ones such as Prudence directs Nature points out  and such as make Duty delightful even commanding most when thou seemest most to submit  It must be owned indeed that thou hast no brutal Mind to deal with Bad as he is it must be said that thou hast a sensible and a generous Heart to work upon one who takes no Glory in the blind Submission of a Slave but like a true  British  Monarch delights to reign in a free rather than in an abject Mind Yet is he jealous as a Tyrant of his Prerogative But you have found the way to lay that watchful Dragon asleep and so possess the golden Fruits of Content and true Pleasure the due Reward of your matchless Conduct  Now my dear  Pamela  I think I have taken Notice of the most material Articles in your Letters and have no more to say to you but Write on and oblige us and mind to send me the Copy of your Letter to Miss  Darnford  of that you wrote to poor penitent  Jewkes  and every Article I have written about and all that comes into your Head or that passes and you'll oblige  Yours c  B DAVERS  LETTER XX  My dear Lady  I Read with Pleasure your Commands in your last kind and obliging Letter and you may be sure of a ready Obedience in every one of them that is in my Power  That which I can most easily do I will first do and that is to transcribe the Answer I sent to Miss  Darnford  and that to Mrs  Jewkes  the former of which and a long one it is is as follows  See Miss  Darnford  's Letter  p  of this Volume    Dear Miss  'I Begin now to be afraid I shall not have the Pleasure and Benefit I promised myself of passing a Fortnight or three Weeks at the Hall in your sweet Conversation and that of your worthy Family as well as those others in your agreeable Neighbourhood whom I must always remember with equal Honour and Delight  'The Occasion will be principally that we expect very soon a Visit from Lord and Lady  Davers  who propose to tarry here a Fortnight at least and after that the advanc'd Season will carry us to  London  where Mr  B  has taken a House for his Winter Residence and in order to attend Parliament A Service he says which he has been more deficient in hitherto than he can either answer to his Constituents or to his own Conscience for tho' he says he is but One yet if any good Motion should be lost by  one  every absent Member who is independent has it to reproach himself with the Consequences that may follow on the Loss of that Good which might otherwise redound to the Commonwealth And besides he says such Excuses as  he  could make  every one  might plead and then publick Affairs might as well be left to the Administration and no Parliament be chosen  'He observed further on this Subject that every absent Member in such Cases indirectly abets the Minister be he  who  he will in all his Designs be they  what  they will and has even less Excuse to his Country than the Man who for a transitory  Benefit to his private Family takes a Pension or Reward for his Vote since the Difference is only that the one passively ruins his Country by Neglect and Indolence which can do nobody good and the other more actively by Corruption which tho' ruinous in the End to the whole Publick in which his own Private is included yet serves to answer some present Turn or Benefit to himself or Family  'See you my dear Miss from the humble Cottager what a publick Person your favour'd Friend is grown And behold how easy it is for a bold Mind to look forward and perhaps forgetting what she was now she imagines she has a Stake in the Country takes upon herself to be as important as significant as if like my dear Miss  Darnford  she had been born to it But if nevertheless I am censur'd for troubling my Head with Politicks let me answer That I am at Liberty I hope to tell you Mr  B  's Sentiments of these high Matters and that is all I have done  'Well but my dearest Miss may I not presume to ask Whether if the Mountain cannot come to  Mahomet Mahomet  will not come to the Mountain Since Lady  Davers  's Visit is so uncertain as to its Beginning and Duration and so great a Favour as I am to look upon it and really shall it being her first Visit to  me  and since we must go and take Possession of our  London  Residence why can't Sir  Simon  spare to us the dear Lady whom he could use so hardly and whose Attendance tho' he is indeed intitled to all her Duty he did not just in that Instance quite so much deserve  '  "Well but after all Sir  Simon  "  'would I say if I had been in Presence at his peevish Hour  "you are a fine Gentleman are you not to shew your  good Daughter that because she did not come  soon enough  to you she came  too soon  And did ever Papa before you put a  good Book  for such I doubt not it was  because  you were in Affliction tho' so little affected by its Precepts to such a  bad Use  As Parents Examples are so prevalent suppose Miss had taken this very Book and flung it at her Sister Miss  Nanny  at her WaitingMaid and so it had gone thro' the Family would it not have been an Excuse for every one to say that the Father and Head of the Family had set the Example  "But again Sir  Simon  Suppose you had hurt the sweet Dovelike Eyes of my dear Miss  Darnford  Suppose you had bruis'd or broken the fine Skin of any Part of that fine Face which gives at first Sight so bright a Promise of her still finer Mind what let me ask you Sir could you have said for yourself How would the dear Miss's Appearance with one sweet Eye perhaps muffled up with a plaister'd Forehead or a veiled Check hiding herself from every body else but you and her grieved Mamma and pitying Sister reproach'd you for so rash an Act nay reproach'd you the more by her unreproaching Obligingness and chearful Duty than if were she capable of it she could have spoken in sharp Complaints and expostulatory Wailings  "You almost wish my dear Miss tells me that I would undertake  you  This is very good of you Sir  Simon    'might I would his indulgent 'Patience suffer me to run on thus have added  "But I hope since you are so sensible that you  want  to be undertaken and since this peevish Rashness convinces me that you  do  that you will undertake  yourself  that you will not when your Indisposition makes the Attendance and  Duty of my dear Lady and Misses necessary make it  more  uncomfortable to them by  adding  a Difficulty of being pleas'd and an Impatience of Spirit to the Concern their Duty and Affection make them have for you and  at least  resolve never to take a Book into your Hand again if you cannot make a better Use of it than you did then  'Pray my dear Miss tell your Papa that I beg the Favour of him to present  me  this Book and I will put a Mark upon it and it shall never more either give or receive such Disgrace I warrant it Be it what it will I will present him with as good a one  'I will write in it  "Memorandum This Book reversing the Author's good Intention had like to have done Mischief next to unpardonable"  'Or  "This Book instead of subduing the Reader's Passions I take it for granted you see Miss it was  Seneca  's Morals or some such good Book had like to have been the Cause of a violent and peevish Evil Henceforth be thou condemned unavailing Teacher to stand by thyself on a lone Shelf in my Closet a Shelf most out of mine or any other Person's Reach for pretending to prescribe Rules for subduing the Passions in so inefficacious a Manner And consign'd to Dust and Cobwebs not once presume in hope to hide thy conscious Guilt to squeeze thyself into Rank with better or at least with more convincing Teachers"  'But do you think my dear Miss Sir  Simon  would be angry if Opportunity had offer'd and I had been thus bold If you think so don't let him see I had such Thoughts in my Head But after all if he were to have been thus freely treated by me and if he should have  blush'd  with  Anger  at my Freedom 'tis but what he ought  to bear from me for more than once has he made me  blush  for  Shame  at much greater on his Part nay and that too in Presence of his virtuous Daughters So that I have but half my Revenge upon him yet And will you bear Malice will he say Mrs  B  Yes Sir  Simon  I will and nothing but your amending the Evil can make me forgive a Gentleman that is  really  a Gentleman who can so sadly forego his Character and before any Company not scruple to expose a modest Virgin to the forward Leer and loud Laugh of younger Gentlemen who durst not take such Liberties of Speech as they would saucily chuckle at from those taken by one of Sir  Simon  's authenticating but better promising Time of Life  'But Sir  Simon  will say I have  already undertaken  him were he to see this Yet my Lady  Darnford  once begg'd I would give him a Hint or two on this Subject which she was pleased to say would be better received from me than from any body And if it be a little too severe it is but a just Reprisal from one whose Ears if he had not cruelly wounded more than once or twice or three times besides what he calls his  innocent  double Entendres she must have been believed by him to be neither more nor less than an HypocriteThere's for you Sir  Simon  and so here ends all my Malice for now I have spoken my Mind  'Yet I hope your dear Papa will not be so angry with me neither as to deny me for this my Freedom the Request I make to  him  to your honoured  Mamma  and to your  dear Self  for your beloved Company for a Month or two in  Bedfordshire  and at  London  And if you might be permitted to winter with us at the latter how  happy should I be It will be half done the Moment you desire it Sir  Simon  loves you too well to refuse you if you are earnest in it Your honoured Mamma is always indulgent to your Requests And Mr  B  as well in Kindness to me as for the great Respect he bears you joins with me to beg this Favour of you and of Sir  Simon  and my Lady  'If it can be obtain'd what Pleasure and Improvement may I not propose to myself with so polite a Companion when we are carried by Mr  B  to the Play to the Opera and other of the Town Diversions We will work together visit together read together sing together and improve one another you  me  in every Word you shall speak in every thing you shall do I  you  by my Questions and Desire of Information which will make you open all your Breast to me and so unlocking that dear Storehouse of virtuous Knowlege improve your own Ideas the more for communicating them O my dear Miss  Darnford  how happy is it in your Power to make me  'I am much affected with the Account you give me of Mrs  Jewkes  's Reformation I could have wished had I not other and stronger Inducements in the Pleasure of so agreeable a Neighbourhood and so sweet a Companion that on her Account I could have been down at the Hall in hope to have confirm'd the poor Woman in her newlyassum'd Penitence God give her Grace to persevere in it To be an humble Means of saving a Soul from Perdition O my dear Miss  Darnford  let me enjoy the Heartravishing HopeTo pluck such a Brand as this out of the Fire and to assist to quench its flaming Susceptibility for Mischief and make it useful to edifying Purposes what a Pleasure does this afford one How does it incourage  one to proceed in the Way one has been guided to pursue How does it make me hope that I am raised to my present Condition in order to be an humble Instrument in the Hand of Providence to communicate great Good to others and so extend to many those Benefits I have receiv'd which were they to go no further than myself what a vile what an ingrateful Creature should I be  'I see my dearest Miss  Darnford  how useful in every Condition of Life a virtuous and a serious Turn of Mind may be  'How have I seen some Ladies in upper Life behave as if they thought good Actions and a pious Turn of Thought would be so unfashionable as to make them the Subjects of Ridicule to the lighterdispos'd World and so they are shamed out of their Duty But let me make it my Boast that here is such a poor Girl as I raised from the Cottage to the Palace as I may say persevering in the good Purposes which had been instilled into her by worthy tho' poor Parents and the best of Ladies her Mistress and resolving to be obstinate in Goodness having stood the Tests of Libertinism has brought the World to expect good Actions from her to respect her for doing them and has even found her Example efficacious thro' Divine Grace to bring over to Penitence and Imitation a poor Creature who used to ridicule her for nothing so much as her Innocence and Virtue which Word and Thing were the constant Subjects of her Scorn as well as the Cause of her Persecution  'But let me not too much dwell upon the dear Thought lest I fall into the Snare that of all others Persons meaning well have Reason to dread  that of  Spiritual Pride  the most dangerous of all Pride  'In hopes of seeing you with us I will not inlarge on several agreeable Subjects that I could touch upon with Pleasure besides what I gave you in my former of my Reception here and of the Kindness of our genteel Neighbours such particularly as the Arrival here of my dear Father and Mother and the kind the generous Entertainment they met with from my best Friend His Condescension in not only permitting me to attend them to  Kent  but accompanying us thither and settling them in a most happy Manner beyond their Wishes and my own but yet so much in Character as I may say that every one must approve his judicious Benevolence The Favours of my good Lady  Davers  to me who pleas'd with my Letters has vouchsaf'd to become my Correspondent and a thousand thousand Things that I want personally to communicate to my dear Miss  Darnford    'Be pleased to present my humble Respects to Lady  Darnford  and to Miss  Nanny  to good Madam  Jones  and to your kind Friends at  Stamford  to Mr and Mrs  Peters  likewise and their Kinswoman And beg of that good Gentleman from me to incourage his new Proselyte all he can and I doubt not she will do Credit poor Woman to the Pains he shall take with her In hopes of your kind Compliance with my Wishes for your Company I remain  'Dearest Miss  'Your faithful and obliged Friend 'and Servant  'P B'  This my good Lady  Davers  is the long Letter I sent to Miss  Darnford  who at parting ingag'd me to keep up a Correspondence with her and put me in hopes of passing a Month or two with us at the Hall if we came down and she could persuade Sir  Simon  and her Mamma to spare her to my Wishes Your Ladyship will excuse me for so faintly mentioning the Honours you confer upon me but I would not either add or diminish in the Communications I make to you  The following is the Copy of what I wrote to Mrs  Jewkes    'YOU give me Mrs  Jewkes  very great Pleasure to find that at length God Almighty has touch'd your Heart and let you see while Health and Strength lasted the Error of your Ways Many an unhappy one has not been so graciously touched till they have smarted under some heavy Afflictions or till they have been confin'd to the Bed of Sickness when perhaps they have made Vows and Resolutions that have held them no longer than the Discipline lasted But you give me much better Hopes of the Sincerity of your Conversion as you are so well convinced before some sore Evil has overtaken you And it ought to be an Earnest to you of the Divine Favour and should keep you from Despondency  'As for me it became me to forgive you as I most cordially did since your Usage of me as it prov'd was but a necessary Means in the Hand of Providence to exalt me to that State of Happiness in which I have every Day more and more Cause given me to rejoice by the kindest and most generous of Gentlemen  'As I have often pray'd for you even when you used me the most unkindly I now praise God for  having heard my Prayers and with high Delight look upon you as a reclaimed Soul given to my Supplications May the Divine Goodness inable you to persevere in the Course you have entered upon And when you can taste the allsurpassing Pleasure that fills the worthy Breast at the being placed in such a Station where your Example may be of Advantage to the Souls of others as well as to your own Soul a Pleasure that every good Mind glories in and none else can worthily taste then may you be assured that nothing but your Perseverance and the consequential Improvement resulting from it is wanted to convince you that you are in a right Way and that the Woe that is pronounced against the presumptuous Sinner belongs not to you  'But dear Mrs  Jewkes  for now  indeed  you are dear to me let me caution you against two Things the one that you return not to your former Ways and wilfully err after this Repentance for in this Case the Divine Goodness will look upon itself as mocked by you and will withdraw itself from you and more fearful will your State then be than if you had never repented The other that you don't despair of the Divine Mercy which has so evidently manifested itself in your Favour and has awakened you out of your deplorable Lethargy without those sharp Medicines and Operations that others and perhaps  not more faulty  Persons have suffer'd But go on chearfully in the happy Path which you have begun to tread Depend upon it you are now in the right Way and turn not either to the Righthand or to the Left For the Reward is before you in Reputation and a good Fame in this Life and everlasting Felicity beyond it  'Your Letter is that of a sensible Woman as I always thought you and of a truly contrite one as  I hope you will approve yourself to be and I the rather hope it because I shall be always desirous then of taking every Opportunity that offers to me of doing you real Service as well with regard to your present as future Life and pleased shall I be to contribute to the one and happy to advance the other For I am  good  Mrs  Jewkes  as I now hope I may call you  'Your loving Friend to serve you  'P B  'Whatever good Books the worthy Mr  Peters  will be so kind to recommend to you and for those under your Direction send for them either to  Lincoln  or  Stamford  or  Grantham  as you can get them and place them to my Account And may they be the efficacious Means of confirming you and them in the worthy Way you are in I have done as much for all here before and I hope to no bad Effect For I shall now tell them by Mrs  Jervis  if there be Occasion that I hope they will not let me be outdone in  Bedfordshire  by Mrs  Jewkes  in  Lincolnshire  but that the Servants of both Houses may do Credit to the best of Masters Adieu  good  Woman as once more I take Pleasure to style you  Thus my good Lady have I obey'd you in transcribing these two Letters I will now proceed to your Ladyship's twelve Articles As to the  I will oblige your Ladyship as I have Opportunity in my future Letters with such Accounts of my dear Lady's Favour and Goodness to me as I think will be acceptable to you and the noble Ladies you mention  I am extremely delighted that your Ladyship thinks so well of my dear honest Parents Indeed they are good People and ever had Minds that set them above low and sordid Actions and God and your good Brother has rewarded them most amply in this World which is more than they ever expected after a Series of Unprosperousness in all they undertook  Your Ladyship is pleased to say that People in upper Life love to see how plain Nature operates in honest Minds who have hardly any thing else for their Guide and if I might not be thought to descend too low for your Ladyship's Attention for as to myself I shall I hope always look back with Pleasure to what I  was  in order to increase my Thankfulness for what I  am  I would give you a Scene of Resignation and contented Poverty of which otherwise your Ladyship can hardly have a Notion I  will  give it because it will be a Scene of Nature however low which your Ladyship loves and it shall not tire you by its Length  It was upon Occasion of a great Loss and Disappointment which happened to my dear Parents for tho' they were never high in Life yet were they not always so low as my honoured Lady found them when she took me My poor Father came home and as the Loss was of such a Nature as that he could not keep it from my Mother he took her Hand I remember well and said after he had acquainted her with it  "Come my Dear let us take Comfort that we did for the best We left the Issue to Providence as we ought and that has turned it as it pleased and we must be content tho' not favoured as we wished All the Business is our Lot is not cast for this Life Let us resign ourselves to the Divine Will and continue to do our Duty and this short Life will soon be past Our  Troubles will be quickly overblown and we shall be happy in a better I make no Doubt"  Then my dear Mother threw her kind Arms about his Neck and said with Tears  "God's Will be done my dear LoveAll cannot be rich and happy I am contented and had rather say I have a poor honest Husband than a guilty rich one What signifies repining Let the World go as it will we shall have our Length and our Breadth at last And Providence I make no Doubt will be a better Friend to our good Girl here because she is good than we could be if this had not happened"  pointing to me who then about Eleven Years old for it was before my Lady took me sat weeping in the Chimney Corner over a few dying Embers of a Fire at their moving Expressions  I arose and kissing both their Hands and blessing them said  "And this Length and Breadth my dear Parents will be one Day all the Rich and the Great can possess and it may be their ungracious Heirs will trample upon their Ashes and rejoice they are gone While such a poor Girl as I am honouring the Memories of mine who in their good Names and good Lessons will have left me the best of Portions"  And then they both hugg'd their prating Girl to their fond Bosoms by Turns and all three were so filled with Comfort in one another that after joining in a grateful Hymn we went to Bed what tho' supperless perhaps with such true Joy that very few of the Rich and Great can have any Idea of it I to my Loft and they to their Rushfloor'd cleanly BedRoom And we have had sweet Sleep and Dreams so pleasant that we have reaped greater Pleasures in repeating them to one another at our next LeisureHour than possibly we should have received had we injoy'd the Comforts we wanted  And truly my Lady I must needs say that while the virtuous Poor can be bless'd with such sweet Injoyments as these in contented Minds all Day and in Dreams and Visions at Night I don't know whether they have not more even of  this  World's Pleasures than the abounding Rich And while the Hours of Night bear so near a Proportion to those of the Day may not such be said even at the worst to pass at least half their Lives with more Comfort than many times the distemper'd Great can pretend to know  For a further Instance that honest Poverty is not such a deplorable State let me ask What Pleasure can those overhappy People taste who never knew that of Hunger or Thirst Like the Eastern Monarch I have read of who marching at the Head of a vast Army thro' a desert Place where was no Water nor any thing to quench his craving Thirst at last one of his Soldiers bringing him in his nasty Helmet a little dirty Water he greedily swallowed it and cry'd out That he never in all his Life had tasted so sweet a Draught Having always before eaten before he was hungry and drank before he was thirsty  But when I talk or write of my dear worthy Parents how I run onExcuse me my good Lady and don't think me in this respect too much like the Cat in the  See the New  Aesop's Fables  sold by  J Osborn  in  Paternoster Row    Fable turn'd into a fine Lady for methinks tho' I would never forget what I was yet I would be thought to know  how  gratefully to injoy my present Happiness as well with regard to my Obligations to GOD as to your dear Brother But let me proceed to your Ladyship's third Particular  And you cannot imagine Madam how much you have set my Heart at Rest when you tell me that my dear Mr  B  gave me a just Narrative of hi  Affair with Miss  Godfrey  For when your Ladyship desir'd to know how he had recounted that Story lest you should make a Misunderstanding between us unawares I did not know what to think I was afraid some Blood had been shed on the Occasion by the dear Gentleman For Miss was ruin'd and as to her nothing could have happened worse And the Regard I have for his future Happiness which costs me in my constant Supplications for him in private many a Tear gave me great Apprehensions and not a little Uneasiness But as your Ladyship tells me that he gave me a just Account I am very happy again  What makes one my dear Lady in our most prosperous Condition be always intermingling one's Fears and one's Anxieties of what  may be  and by that Means rob one's self of the Prime of one's best worldly Injoyments Is this Apprehensiveness does your Ladyship think implanted in our Natures for I know I am not vapourish nor the only Person who is thus constituted for wise and good Ends that we may not think ourselves so happy here as to make us forget that there is a better and more perfectly happy State which we ought to aspire after I believe it is And if so what an useful Monitor do we carry about us that shall make us consider and reflect when in Prosperity and in Adversity teach us to bear up to Hopes of a happier Lot Thus is it prettily said by a Translator of one of  Horace  's Odes  Be Life and Spirit when Fortune proves unkind  And summon up the Vigour of thy Mind  But when thou'rt driv'n by too officious Gales  Be wise and gather in the swelling Sails  I now come to your Ladyship's fourth Particular  And highly delighted I am for having obtained your Approbation of my Conduct to the Child as well as of my Behaviour to the dear Gentleman on the unhappy Lady's Score Your Ladyship's wise Intimations about having the Child with me make due Impression upon me and I see in them with grateful Pleasure your kind and unmerited Consideration for me Yet I don't know how it is but I have conceived a strange Passion for this dear Baby I cannot but look upon her poor Mamma as my Sister in point of Trial And shall not the prosperous Sister pity and love the poor dear Sister that in so slippery a Path has  fallen  while  she  had the Happiness to keep her Feet  No doubt Miss  Godfrey  loved Virtue and preferred it to all Considerations 'Tis plain she did even after her Fall when as I have observed in the Papers  See  Vol II  p    I sent your Ladyship she could leave Country Parents Friends and the Man of all others she loved best and seek a new Fortune run the Danger of the Seas and perhaps the Hazards of meeting with worse Men rather than trust to her own Strength where it had once so unhappily failed her What a Love of Virtue for Virtue's Sake is this I know not who could have acted up to this Part of her Character  The rest of your Ladyship's Articles give me the greatest Pleasure and Satisfaction and if I can but continue myself in the Favour of your dear Brother and improve in that of his noble Sister how happy shall I be I will do all I can to deserve both And I hope your Ladyship will take as an Instance that I would the chearful Obedience which I pay to your  Commands in writing to so fine a Judge such crude and indigested Stuff as otherwise I ought to be ashamed to lay before you  I am impatient for the Honour which your Ladyship makes me hope for of your Presence here And yet I perplex myself with the Fear of appearing so unworthy in your Eyes when near you as to suffer in your Opinion but I promise myself that however this may be the Case on your  first  Visit I shall be so much improved by the Benefits I shall reap from your Lessons and good Example that whenever I shall be favoured with a  Second  you shall have less Faults to find with me till as I shall be more and more favoured I shall in time be just what your Ladyship will wish me to be and of Consequence more worthy than I am of the Honour of styling myself  Your Ladyship's most humble and obedient Servant  P B  LETTER XXI From Miss  Darnford  In Answer to Mrs  B  's  p  My dear Mrs  B  YOU are highly obliging to me in expressing so warmly your Wishes to have me with you I know not any body in this World out of our own Family in whose Company I should be happier But my Papa won't part with me I think tho' I had secur'd my Mamma in my Interest and I know  Nancy  would be glad of my Absence because the dear perversly Envious thinks  me  more valued than  she  is and yet foolish Girl she don't consider that if her Envy be wellgrounded I should return with more than double Advantages to what I now have improv'd by your charming Example and Conversation  My Papa affects to be in a fearful Pet at your lecturing of him so justly for my Mamma would shew it him and he says he will positively demand Satisfaction of Mr  B  for your treating him so freely And yet he shall hardly think him he says on a Rank with him unless Mr  B  will on Occasion of the new Commission take out his  Dedimus  And then if he will bring you down to  Lincolnshire  and join with him to commit you Prisoner for a Month at the Hall all shall be well  It is very obliging in Mr  B  to join in your kind Invitation Butyet I am loth to say it to youBut the Character of your worthy Gentleman I doubt stands a little in the Way with my Papa For he will have it that he is just such a Rake as is to be liked by a Lady one that saves common Appearances and that's all and is too handsome too witty and too enterprizing for any  honest Man  that's Si  Simon  's Phrase  to trust his Daughter with    My Mamma pleaded his being marry'd Adsdines Madam said he what of all that What married Man when a pretty Girl's in the Way minds his Wife except she has made him stand in Fear of her and that's far from the Case here Why I tell you added his peevish Highness if our  Polly  should happen to slip I thank him for his Supposition he'd make his Lady nurse both  her  and the  Bastard  another of his polite Expressions if he had a mind to it and she durst not refuse him And would you trust such a spritely Girl as  Polly  in the House with such a Fellow as that  These it seems were his Words and Reasonings I thank him for his Opinion of his Daughter It becomes not me to say by what Rules my Papa judges of Mankind Rules however that are not much to the Credit of his Sex But it made me put on very grave Airs when I came to Supper for after  this Repulse and the Reasons given for it I pretended Indisposition not to dine with my Papa being halfvex'd and halfafraid of his Raillery and he said Why how now  Polly  What in the Sullens Girl I said I should have hoped that I never gave my Papa Cause to suspect my Conduct and that he would have had a better Opinion of the Force which the Example and Precepts of my good Mamma had upon me  Not your  Papa  's Example then Very well Saucebox I understand you  But Sir said I I hope if I may not go to  Bedfordshire  you'll permit me to go to  London  when Mrs  B  goes  No said he positively no  Well Sir I have done I could hope however you would inable me to give a better Reason to good Mrs  B  why I am not permitted to accept of her kind Invitation than that which I understand you have been pleased to assign  He stuck his Hands in his Sides with his usual humourous Positiveness Why then tell her she is a very saucy Lady for her last Letter to you and that her Lord and Master is not to be trusted and it is my absolute Will and Pleasure that you ask me no more Questions about it  I will very faithfully make this Report Sir Do so And so I have And your poor  Polly Darnford  is disappointed of one of the greatest Pleasures she could have had  I can't help it And if you truly pity me I can put you in a Way to make me easier under the Disappointment than otherwise I can possibly be and that is to favour me with an Epistolary Conversation since I am deny'd a Personal one and this my Mamma joins to request of you and particularly to let us know how Lady  Davers  's first Visit passes  which Mrs  Peters  and Mrs  Jones  who know my Lady so well likewise long to hear And this will make us the best Amends in your Power for the Loss of your good Neighbourhood which we had all promis'd to ourselves  This Denial of my Papa comes out since I wrote the above to be principally owing to a Proposal made him of an humble Servant to one of his Daughters He won't say which he tells us in his usual humourous Way lest we should fall out about it  I suppose I tell him the young Gentleman is to pick and chuse which of the two he likes best But be he a Duke 'tis all one to  Polly  if he is not something above our common  Lincolnshire  Class of Foxhunters  I have shewn Mr and Mrs  Peters  your Letter They admire you beyond Expression and Mr  Peters  says He does not know that ever he did any thing in all his Life that ever gave him so much inward Reproach as his denying you the Protection of his Family which Mr  Williams  See  Vol I  p    sought to move him to afford you when you were confined at the Hall before Mr  B  came down to you with his Heart bent on Mischief and all he comforts himself with is that that very Denial as well as the other Hardships you met with were necessary to bring about that Work of Providence which was to reward your unexampled Virtue  Yet he says he doubts he shall not be thought excusable by you who are so exact in your own Duty as he had the Unhappiness to lose such an Opportunity to have done Honour to his Function had he had the Fortitude to have done  his  and he begg'd of me some how or other and at some time or other to hint his Concern to you on this Head and to hope  in his Name that neither Religion nor his Cloth may suffer in your Opinion for the Fault of one of its Professors who never was wanting in his Duty so much before  He had it often upon his Mind he says to write to you on this very Subject but he had not the Courage and besides did not know how Mr  B  might take it if he should see that Letter as the Case had such delicate Circumstances in it that in blaming himself as he should very freely have done he must by Implication have cast still greater Blame upon him  Mr  Peters  is certainly a very good Man and my Favourite for that Reason and I hope  you  that could so easily forgive the late wicked but now penitent  Jewkes  will overlook with Kindness a Fault in a good Man that proceeded more from Pusillanimity and Constitution than from Want of Principle And once talking of it to my Mamma and me he accused himself on this score to her with Tears in his Eyes She good Lady would have given you this Protection at Mr  William  's Desire but wanted the  See  Vol I  p    Power to do it  So you see my dear Mrs  B  how your Virtue has shamed every one into such a Sense of what they ought to have done that Good Bad and Indifferent are seeking to make Excuses for past Misbehaviour and to promise future Amendment like penitent Subjects returning to their Duty to their conquering Sovereign after some unworthy Defection  Happy happy Lady may you be ever so May you always convert your Enemies confirm the Lukewarm and every Day multiply your Friends prays  Your most affectionate  POLLY DARNFORD  P S How I rejoice in the Joy of your honest Parents God bless 'em I am glad Lady  Davers  is so wise Every one I have named desire their best Respects Let me hear from you oftener and omit not the minutest Thing For every Line of yours carries Instruction with it  LETTER XXII From Sir  SIMON DARNFORD  to Mr  B  SIR  LITTLE did I think I should ever have Occasion to make a formal Complaint against a Person very dear to you and who I believe deserves to be so but don't let them be so proud and so vain of obliging and pleasing you as to make them not care how they affront every body else  The Person is no other than the Wife of your Bosom who has taken such Liberties with me as ought not to be taken and sought to turn my own Child against me and make a dutiful Girl a Rebel  If People will set up for Virtue and all that let 'em be uniformly virtuous or I would not give a Farthing for their Pretences to it  Here I have been plagued with Gouts Rheumatisms and nameless Disorders ever since you left us which have made me call for a little more Attendance than ordinary and I had Reason to think myself slighted where an indulgent Father can least bear to be slighted that is where he most loves and that by young Upstarts who are growing up to the Injoyment of those Pleasures which have run away from me fleeting Rascals as they are before I was willing to part with them And I rung and rung and  Where's  Polly  for I honour the Slut with too much of my Notice Where's  Polly  was all my Cry to every one who came up to ask what I rung for And at last in burst the pert Slut with an Air of Assurance as if she thought all must be well the Moment she appeared with Do you want me Papa  Do I want you Confidence Yes I do Where have you been these two Hours and never came near me when you knew 'twas my Time to have my Foot rubbed which gives me mortal Pain For you must understand Mr  B  that nobody's Hand's so soft as  Polly's    She gave me a saucy Answer as I was disposed to think it because I had just then a Twinge that I could scarce bear for Pain is a plaguy thing to a Man of my lively Spirits Why with a Px to it cannot it go and rouse up some stupid lethargic Rascal whose Blood is ready to stagnate There it might do some Good and not make an honest Man miserable as it does me who want none of its pungent Helps to Feeling  She gave me I say a pert Answer and turn'd upon her Heel and not coming near me at my first Word I flung a Book I had in my Hand at her Head  This the saucy Slut Girls nowadays make nothing of exposing their indulgent Parents has mentioned in a Letter to your Lady and she has abused me upon it in  such  a Manner Well if you don't take some Course with her I must with you that's positive and young as you are and a Cripple as I am I'll stump to an appoin  ed Place to procure to myself the Satisfaction of a Man of Honour  Your Lady has written to  Polly  what  she  would have said to me on this Occasion She has reflected upon me for not reading a Book of Mortification when I was labouring under so great a Sense of it  and confin'd to my ElbowChair in one Room whom lately half a Dozen Counties could hardly contain She has put it into  Polly  's Head to fling this very Book at her Sister's Head in Imitation of my Example and hopes  Nancy  will fling it at somebody's else till it goes all round the House She reproaches me for making no better Use of a  good  Book as she calls  Rabelais  's  Pantagruel  which I innocently was reading to make me the more chearfully bear my Misfortune and runs on a Pack of Stuff about my  Polly  's Eyes and Skin and I don't know what on Purpose to fill the Girl with Notions that don't belong to her in order to make her proud and saucy and then to inspire her with Insolence to me runs on with Suppositions of what Harm I might have done her had the Book bruised her Face or Eyes and so forth As if our Daughters Eyes were not our own Eyes their brazen Faces our brazen Faces at least till we can find somebody to take them and all the rest of their Trumpery off of our Hands Saucy Baggages who have neither Souls nor Senses but what they have borrowed from us and whose very Bones and the Skin that covers them so much their Pride and their Ornament are so many Parts of our own undervalued Skin and Bones and ours only are more wrinkled by taking Pains to make theirs smooth  Nay this fine Lady of yours this Paragon of Meekness and Humility in so many Words bids me or tells my own Daughter to bid me which is worse never to take a Book in my Hands again if I won't make a better Use of it And yet what better Use can an offended Father make of the best Books than to correct a rebellious Child with them and oblige a saucy Daughter to jump into her Duty all at once  Then pray Sir do you allow your Lady to beg Presents from Gentlemen This is a tender Point to touch upon But you shall know all I am resolv'dFor here she sends to desire me to make her a Present of this very Book and promises to send me another as good  Come come Sir these are no jesting Matters for is it not a sad thing to think that Ladies let them be young or old wellmarry'd or illmarry'd cannot live without Intrigue And here if I were not a very honest Man and your Friend and  resolv'd  to be a virtuous Man too in spite of Temptation one does not know what might be the Consequence of such a Correspondence as is here begun or rather  desired  to be begun for I have too much  Honour  to give into it for your sake and I hope you'll think yourself much oblig'd to me I know the Time that I have improv'd a more mysterious Hint than this into all that I had a Mind to make of it And it may be very happy for you Neighbour that I  must  and  will  be virtuous let the Temptation be from whom it will For the finest Lady in the World is nothing to me now in this my Reformed State  But this is not all Mrs  B  goes on to reflect upon me for making her blush formerly and saying Things before my Daughters that truly I ought to be ashamed to say and then avows Malice and Revenge and all that Why Sir why Neighbour are these Things to be borne Do you allow your Lady to set up for a general Corrector of every body's Morals but your own Do you allow her to condemn the only Instances of Wit that remain to this Generation that dear polite  Double Entendre  ▪ which keeps alive the Attention and quickens the Apprehension of the best Companies in the World and is the Salt the Sauce which gives a Poignancy to all our genteeler Entertainments  Very fine truly that more than half the World shall be shut out of Society shall be precluded their Share of Conversation among the Gay and Polite of both Sexes were your Lady to have her Will Let her first find People that can support a Conversation with Wit and good Sense like her own and then something might be said But till then I positively say and will swear upon Occasion that  Double Entendre  shall not be banished from our Tables and where this won't raise a Blush or create a Laugh we will be at Liberty if we please for all Mrs  B  and her newfangled Notions to force the one and the other by still plainer Hints and let her help herself how she can  Thus Sir you find my Complaints are of a high Nature regarding the Quiet of a Family the Duty of a Child to a Parent the Advances of a married Lady to a Gentleman who is resolv'd to be virtuous and the Freedom of Conversation in all which Points your Lady has greatly offended and I insist upon Satisfaction from you or such a Correction of the fair Transgressor as is in your Power to inflict and which may prevent worse Consequences from  Your offended Friend and Servant  SIMON DARNFORD  LETTER XXIII From Mr  B  In Answer to the preceding  Dear Sir  Simon  YOU cannot but believe that I was much surprised at your Letter complaining of the Behaviour of my Wife I could no more have expected such a Complaint from such a  Gentleman than I could that  she  would have deserved it And I am very sorry on  both  Accounts I have talked to her in such a Manner that I dare say she will never give you like Cause to appeal to me  It happened that the Criminal herself received your Letter from her Servant and brought it to me in my Closet and making her Honours for I can't say but she is very obliging to me tho' she takes such saucy Freedoms with my Friends away she tripp'd and I inquiring for her when with Surprize as you may believe I had read your Charge found she was gone to visit a poor sick Neighbour of which indeed she had before appris'd me because she took the Chariot but I had forgot it in my Wrath  'Twas well for her that she was not in the Way perhaps I should have taken more severe Methods with her in my first Emotions and I long'd for her Return And there is another  Wellforher  too in her Case for one would be loth to spoil a Son and Heir you know Sir  Simon  before we see whether the little Varlet may deserve one's Consideration  I mention these Things that you may observe it was not owing to any Regard for the Offender herself that I did not punish her as much as injur'd Friendship requir'd at my Hands  At last in she came with that sweet Composure in her Face which results from a Consciousness of doing  generally  just and generous Things altho' in this Instance she has so egregiously err'd that it behoves me as well in Justice to my Friend as Policy to myself for who knows whither first Faults may lead if not checked in time to nip such Boldness in the Bud And indeed the Moment I beheld the Charmer of my Heart for I do love her too well that's certain all my Anger was disarm'd and had the Offence regarded  myself  I must have forgiven her in spite of  all my meditated Wrath But it behov'd me in a  Friend  's Case not to be soon subdu'd by a too partial Fondness I resumed therefore that Sternness and Displeasure which her Entrance had almost dissipated I took her Hand Her charming Eye you know what an Eye she has Sir  Simon  quivered at my overclouded Aspect and her Lips halfdrawn to a Smile trembled with Apprehension of a Countenance so changed from what she left it  And then all stiff and stately as I could look did I accost her Come along with me  Pamela  to my Closet I want to talk with you  Dear Sir good Sir what's the Matter what have I done  We entered I sat down still holding her unsteady Hand and her Pulse fluttering under my Finger like a dying Bird  'Tis  well  said I 'tis  well  your present Condition pleads for you and I must not carry what I have to say too far for Considerations less in your Favour than for one unseen But I have great Complaints against you  Against me Sir What have I done Let me know dear good Sir looking round with her halfaffrighted Eyes this way and that on the Books and Pictures and on me by Turns  You shall know soon said I the Crime you have been guilty of  Pray let me Sir This Closet I hoped would not be a  second  Time Witness to the Flutter you put me in  There  hangs a Tale Sir  Simon  that I am not very fond of relating since it gave Beginning to the Triumphs of this  See  Vol I  p    little Sorceress  I still held one Hand and she stood before me as Criminals ought to do before their Judge but said I see Sir sure I do or what will else become of me less Severity in your Eyes than you affect to put on in your Countenance Dear Sir let me know my Fault I will repent acknowlege and amend Let me  but  know it  You must have great Presence of Mind  Pamela  reply'd I such is the Nature of your Fault if you can look me in the Face when I tell it you  Then let me said the irresistible Charmer hiding her Face in my Bosom and putting her other Arm about my Neck let me thus my Mr  B  hide this guilty Face while I hear my Fault told and I will not seek to extenuate it but by my Tears and my Penitence  I could hardly hold out What infatuating Creatures are these Women when they can think it thus worth their while to sooth and calm the Tumults of an angry Heart When instead of  scornful  Looks darted in Return for  angry  ones Words of  Defiance  for Words of  Peevishness  persisting to defend  one  Error by  another  and returning  vehement Wrath  for  slight Indignation  and all the hostile Provocations of the Marriage Warfare they can thus hide their dear Faces in our Bosoms and wish but to  know  their Faults to  amend  them  I could hardly I say resist the sweet Girl's Behaviour nay I believe I did unawares to myself and in Defiance of my resolv'd Displeasure press her Forehead with my Lips as the rest of her Face was hid on my Breast But considering it was the Cause of my  Friend  that I was to assert my  injured  Friend wounded and insulted in so various a Manner by the fair Offender thus haughtily spoke I to the trembling Mischief in a Pomp of Style theatrically tragick  I will not too inadvertent and undistinguishing  Pamela  keep you long in Suspense for the sake of a Circumstance that on this Occasion ought to give you as much Joy as it has till now given me Since it becomes an Advocate in your Favour when otherwise you might expect a very severe Treatment Know then that the Letter you gave me before you went out is a Letter from a Friend a Neighbour a worthy Neighbour complaining of your Behaviour to him no other than Sir  Simon Darnford  for I would not amuse her too much a Gentleman I must always respect and whom as  my  Friend I expected  you  should Since by the Value a Wife expresses for one esteemed by her Hu  band whether she thinks so well of him herself or not a Man ought always to judge of the Sincerity of her Regards to himself  She raised her Head at once on this Thank Heav'n said she it is no worseI was at my Wits End almost in Apprehension But I know how this must beDear Sir How could you frighten me soI know how all this isI can now look you in the Face and hear all that Sir  Simon  can charge me with For I am sure I have not so affronted him as to make him angry indeed And truly ran she on secure of Pardon as she seem'd to think I should respect Sir  Simon  not only as your Friend but on his own Account if he was not so sad a Rake at a Time of Life  Then I interrupted her you must needs think Sir  Simon  for how could I bear to hear my worthy Friend so freely treatedHow now  Pamela  said I and is it thus by  repeating  your Fault that you  atone  for it Do you think I can bear to hear my Friend so freely treated  Indeed said she I do respect Sir  Simon  very much as your  Friend  permit me to repeat but  cannot for his wilful Failings Would it not be in some measure to approve of faulty Conversation if one can hear it and not discourage it when the Occasion comes in so pat And indeed I was glad of an Opportunity continued she to give him a little Rub I must needs own it But if it displeases you or has made him angry in Earnest I am sorry for it and will be less bold for the future  Read then said I the heavy Charge and I'll return instantly to hear your Answer to it So I went from her for a few Minutes  But would you believe it Sir  Simon  she seem'd on my Return very little concerned at your just ComplaintsWhat selfjustifying Minds have the meekest of these WomenInstead of finding her in repentant Tears as one might have expected she took your angry Letter for a jocular one and I had great Difficulty to convince her of the Heinousness of  her  Fault or the Reality of  your  Anger Upon which being determin'd to have Justice done to my Friend and a due Sense of her own great Error impress'd upon her I began thus  Pamela Pamela  take heed that you do not suffer the Purity of your own Mind in Breach of your Charity to make you too rigorous a Censurer of other Peoples Actions Don't be so puff'd up with your own Perfections as to imagine that because other Persons allow themselves Liberties you cannot take  therefore  they must be wicked Sir  Simon  is a Gentleman who indulges himself in a pleasant Vein and I believe as well as you  has been  a great Rake and Libertine you'll excuse me Sir  Simon  because I am taking your Part But what then You see it is all over with him now You see he says himself that he  must  and therefore he  will  be virtuous And is a Man for ever to hear of the Faults of his Youth when he himself is so willing to forget them  Ah but Sir Sir said the bold Slut can you say he is  willing  to forget themDoes he not repine here in this very Letter that he  must  forsake them and does he not plainly cherish the  Inclination  when he ownsShe hesitatedOwns whatYou know what I mean Sir and I need not speak it And can there well be a more censurable CharacterThen dear Sir  before  his Maiden Daughters  before  his virtuous Lady  before  AnybodyWhat a sad thing is this at a Time of Life which should afford a better Example  But dear Sir continu'd the bold Prattler taking Advantage of a Silence that was more owing to Displeasure than Approbation let me for I would not be  censorious  No not she In the very Act of Censoriousness to say this let me offer but one thing Don't you think Sir  Simon  himself would be loth to be thought a reform'd Gentleman Don't you see the Delight he takes when he speaks of his former Pranks as if he was sorry he could not play them over again See but how he simpers and  injoys  as one may say the Relations of his own rakish Actions when he tells a bad StoryAnd have you not seen how often he has been forced to take his Handkerchief to wipe the Outside of his Mouth tho' the Inside wanted it most when he has wounded a Lady's Ears and turn'd as it were his own faulty Heart inside outIndeed Sir I am afraid so bad in this way is your worthy Neighbour that he would account it a Disgrace to him to be thought reform'd And how then can I abuse the Gentleman by representing him in a Light in which he loves to be considered  But said I were this the Case for I profess Sir  Simon  I was at a grievous Loss to defend you for you to write all these free things against a Father to his Daughter is that right  Pamela  O Sir the  good  Gentleman himself has taken care that such a Character as I presum'd to draw to Miss of her Papa was no strange one to her You have seen yourself Mr  B  whenever his arch Leers and the humourous Attitude in which he puts himself on those Occasions have taught us to expect some shocking Story how his Lady and Daughters us'd to him as they are have suffer'd in their Apprehensions of what he would say before he spoke it How particularly dear Miss  Darnford  has look'd at me with Concern desirous as it were if possible to save her Papa from the Censure which his faulty Expressions must naturally bring upon him And dear Sir is it not a sad thing for a young Lady who loves and honours her Papa to observe that he is discrediting himself and  wants  the Example he ought to  give  And pardon me Sir for smiling on so serious an Occasion continu'd she but is it not a fine Sight do you think to see a Gentleman as we have more than once seen Sir  Simon  when he has thought proper to read a Passage or so in some bad Book pulling off  his Spectacles  to talk filthily Methinks I see him now added the bold Slut splitting his arch Face with a broad Laugh shewing a Mouth with hardly a Tooth in it while he is making obscene Remarks upon what he has read  And then the dear Saucyface laugh'd out to bear  me  Company for I could not for the Soul of me avoid laughing heartily at the Figure she brought to my Mind which I have seen my old Friend make on two or three Occasions of this sort with his dismounted Spectacles his arch Mouth and Gums of shining Jet succeeding those of polish'd Ivory of which he often boasts as one Ornament of his youthful DaysAnd I the rather in my Heart Sir  Simon  gave you up because when I was a sad Fellow it was always a Maxim with me to endeavour  to touch a Lady's Heart without wounding her Ears And indeed I found my Account sometimes in observing it  But resuming my Gravity Hussy said I do you think I will have my old Friend thus made the Subject of your RidiculeSuppose a Challenge should have ensu'd between us on your AccountWhat might have been the Issue of it To see an old Gentleman stumping as he says on Crutches to fight a Duel in Defence of his wounded Honour A pretty Sight this would have afforded would it not And what had any one met him on the Way could he have said he was going to do Don't you consider that a Man is answerable for the Faults of his Wife And if my Fondness for you would have made me deny doing Justice to my Friend and on the contrary to resolve in your behalf to give him a Meeting and he had flung his Crutch at my Head as he did the Book at his Daughter's what might have been the Consequence think you  Very bad Sir said she to be sure I see that and am sorry for it For had you carry'd off Sir  Simon  's Crutch as a Trophy the poor Gentleman must have lain sighing and groaning like a wounded Soldier in the Field of Battle till another had been brought him to have stump'd home with  But dear Sir  Simon  I have brought this Matter to an Issue that will I hope make all easy And that is thisMiss  Polly  and my  Pamela  shall both be punish'd as they deserve if it be not your own Fault I am told that the Sins of your Youth don't fit so heavily upon your Limbs as they do in your Imagination and I believe Change of Air and the Gratification of your Revenge a fine Help to such lively Spirits as yours will set you up You shall then take Coach and bring your pretty Criminal to mine and when we have them together they  shall humble themselves before us and it shall be in your Power to absolve or punish them as you shall see proper For I cannot bear to have my worthy Friend insulted in so heinous a manner by a couple of saucy Girls who if not taken down in time may proceed from Fault to Fault till there will be no Living with them  If to be still more serious your Lady and you will lend Miss  Darnford  to my  Pamela  's Wishes whose Heart is set upon the Hope of her wintering with us in Town you will lay an Obligation upon us both which will be acknowleged with great Gratitude by Dear Sir  Your affectionate and humble Servant  LETTER XXIV From Sir  SIMON DARNFORD  in Reply  HARK ye me 'Squire  B  A Word in your EarI like neither you nor your Wife to be plain with you well enough to trust my  Polly  with you What you are to shew her in your Lady's Case all the Game of a Lyingin I suppose and at least set the Girl a longing to make one in the Dance before I have found out the proper Man for her Partner  But here's War declar'd against my poor Gums it seems Well I will never open my Mouth before your Lady as long as I live if I can help it I have for these Ten Years avoided to put on my Cravat and for what Reason do you thinkWhy because I could not bear to see what Ruins a few Years have made in a Visage that us'd to inspire Love and Terror as it pleas'dAnd here yourWhatshallIcallher of a Wife with all the Insolence of Youth  and Beauty on her Side follows me with a Glass and would make me look in it whether I will or not I'm a plaguy goodhumour'd old Fellowif I  am  an old Fellowor I should not bear the Insults contain'd in your Letter Between you and your Lady you make a wretched Figure of me that's certain And yet 'tis  taking my Part  with a Px to  you  Mr  B  I would have said but on your Lady's AccountYou see I have as much more Charity than her as she has Purity than me or I should not have put in that Saving Clause in her Behalf  Dismounted Spectacles arch Mouth Gums of shining Jet  and suchlike fine Descriptions are these yours or your Lady's I'd be glad to know that Mr  B    Well but What a Dl must a Man doI'd be glad at any Rate to stand in your Lady's Graces that I would Nor would I be the last Rake and Libertine unreform'd by her Example which I suppose will make Virtue the Fashion if she goes on at the Rate she does But here I have been us'd to cut a Joke and toss the Squib about and as far as I know it has help'd to keep me alive in the midst of Pains and Aches and with two Womengrown Girls and the rest of the Mortifications that will attend on  advanced Years  for I won't hang me if I will give it up as absolute  Oldage    I love I own it to make a pretty Woman blush it is doubledamasking a fine Rose as it were and till I saw yourDo let me call her some free Name or other I always lov'd to be free with pretty Women Till I saw yourMethinks I like her  Arcadian  Name tho' I'm so old a Swain as not to merit any thing but Rebuke at her Hands Well then till I saw your  Pamela  I thought all Ladies in their Hearts lov'd a little Squib of that kind For why should they not when it adds so  much Grace to their Features and improves their native CharmsAnd often have I toss'd the Joke about as much in my Intention to oblige  them  as  myself  Yet no one can say but that I always wrapt it up in clean Linen as the Saying isOnly suiting myself to my Company till I had made the dear Rogues  sensible  and shew they could apprehend  But now it seems I must leave all this off or I must be mortify'd with a Lookingglass held before me and every Wrinkle must be made as conspicuous as a CableropeAnd what pray is to succeed to this ReformationI can neither fast nor pray I doubtAnd besides if my Stomach and my Jest depart from me farewel Sir  Simon Darnford  But cannot I pass as one necessary Character do you think as a Foil as bythebye some of your own Actions have been to your Lady's Virtue to set off some more edifying Example where Variety of Characters make up a Feast in Conversation  I beseech you Mr  B  's  Pamela  stick me into some Posy among your finer Flowers And if you won't put me in your Bosom let me stand in some gay Flowerpot in your Chimney Corner I may serve for Shew if not for Smell Or let me be the Bass in your Musick or permit my humourous Humdrum to serve as a pardonable kind of Discord to set off your own HarmonyI verily think I cannot be so good as you'd have me to be So pray let your poor  Anacreon  go off with what he loves It will be very cruel if you won't  Well but after all I believe I might have trusted you with my Daughter under your Lady's Eye Rake as you have been yourself And Fame says wrong if you have not been for your Time a bolder Sinner than ever I was with your Maxim of touching Ladies Hearts without wounding their Ears which made surer Work with them that was all  tho' 'tis to be hoped you are now reformed and if you are the whole Country round you East West North and South owe great Obligations to your fair Reclaimer But here is a fine prim young Fellow coming out of  Norfolk  with one Estate in one County another in another and Jointures and Settlements in his Hands and more Wit in his Head as well as more Money in his Pocket than he can tell what to do with to visit our  Polly  tho' I tell her I much question the former Quality his Wit if he is for marryingAnd would you have her be attending your Wife's Nursery when she may possibly be put in a Way to have a Rareeshew of her  own  Here then is the Reason I cannot comply with your kind Mrs  B  's Request But if this Matter should go off if he should not like  her  or she  him  or if I should not like  his  Terms or he  mine  or still another  Or  if he should like  Nancy  better why then perhaps if  Polly  be a good Girl I may trust to her Virtue and to your Honour and let her go for a Month or two for the Devil's in you if you'd attempt to abuse such a generous Confidence As to the Superiority of Beauty in your own Lady I depend nothing on that with you young Fellows to whom Variety has generally greater Charms  Now when I have said this and when I say further that I can forgive your severe Lady and yourself too who however are less to be excus'd in the Airs you assume which looks like one Chimneysweeper calling another sooty Rascal I give a Proof of my Charity which I hope with Mrs  B  will cover a Multitude of Faults and the rather since tho' I cannot be a  Follower  of her Virtue in the strictest Sense I can be an  Admirer  of it and that is some little Merit And indeed all that can be at present pleaded by  yourself  I doubt any more than  Your humble Servant  SIMON DARNFORD  LETTER XXV  My honoured and dear Parents  I Hope you will excuse my long Silence which has been owing to several Causes and having had nothing new to entertain you with And yet this last is but a poor Excuse neither to you who think every trifling Subject agreeable from your Daughter  I daily expect here my Lord and Lady  Davers  This gives me no small Pleasure and yet it is mingled with some Uneasiness at times lest I should not when view'd so intimately near behave myself answerably to her Ladyship's Expectations But this I resolve upon I will not endeavour to move out of the Sphere of my own Capacity in order to emulate her Ladyship She has and must have Advantages by Conversation as well as Education which it would be Arrogance in me to assume or to think of imitating  All that I will attempt to do therefore shall be to shew such a respectful Obligingness to my Lady as shall be consistent with the Condition to which I am raised that so her Ladyship may not have Reason to reproach me of Pride in my Exaltation nor her dear Brother to rebuke me for Meanness in condescending And as to my Family Management I am the less afraid of Inspection because by the natural Byass of my own Mind I bless God I am above dark Reserves and have not one selfish or sordid View that should make me wish to avoid the most scrutinizing Eye  I have begun a Correspondence with Miss  Darnford  a young Lady of uncommon Merit But you know her Character from my former Writings She is very solicitous to hear of every thing that concerns  me and particularly how Lady  Davers  and I agree together I loved her from the Moment I saw her first for she has the least Pride and the most Benevolence and solid Thought I ever knew in a young Lady and knows not what it is to envy any one I shall write to her often And as I shall have so many Avocations besides to fill up my Time I know you will excuse me if I procure from Miss as I hope to do the Return of my Letters to her for your Perusal and the Entertainment of your Leisure Hours This will give you from time to time the Accounts you desire of all that happens here But as to what relates to our own Particulars I beg you will never spare writing as I shall not answering for it is one of my greatest Delights that I have such dear such worthy Parents as I hope in God I long shall to bless me and to correspond with me  The Papers I send herewith will afford you some Diversion particularly those relating to Sir  Simon Darnford  and I must desire that when you have perused them as well as what I shall send for the future you will return them to me  Mr  Longman  gave me great Pleasure on his last Return from you in his Account of your Health and the Satisfaction you take in your happy Lot and I must recite to you a brief Conversation on this Occasion that I dare say will please you as much as it did me  After he had been adjusting some Affairs with his dear Principal which took them up two Hours my best Beloved sent for meMy Dear said he takeing my Hand and seating me down by him and making the good old Gentleman sit down for he will always rise at my Approach Mr  Longman  and I have settled in two Hours some Accounts which would have taken up as many Months with some Persons But never was an exacter or more methodical  Accomptant than Mr  Longman  He gives me greatly to my Satisfaction because I know it will delight you an Account of the  Kentish  Concern and of the Pleasure your Father and Mother take in it Now my Charmer said he I see your sweet Eyes begin to glistenO how this Subject raises your whole Soul to the Windows of it Never was so dutiful a Daughter Mr  Longman  and never did Parents better deserve a Daughter's Duty  I endeavour'd before Mr  Longman  to rein in a Gratitude that my throbbing Heart confessed thro' my Handkerchief as I could perceive But the good old Gentleman could not hinder his from shewiug itself at his worthy Eyes to see how much I was favour'd  oppress'd  I should say with the dearest Gentleman's tender Goodness to me and kind ExpressionsExcuse me Sir excuse me Madam said he wiping his Cheeks My Delight to see such Merit so justly rewarded will not be contained I think And so he got up and walked to the Window  Well good Mr  Longman  said I as he returned towards us you give me the Pleasure to know that my Father and Mother are well and happy then they  must  be in a Goodness and Bounty that I and many more rejoice in  Well and happy Madam Ay that they are indeed And a worthier Couple never lived I assure you Most nobly do they go on in the Farm Your Honour's one of the happiest Gentlemen in the World All the Good you do returns upon you in a Trice It may well be said  You cast your Bread upon the Waters  for it presently comes to you again richer and heavier than when you threw it in All the  Kentish  Tenants Madam are hugely delighted with their good Steward Every thing prospers under his Management The Gentry love both  him and my Dame and the poor People adore them Indeed they do a Pow'r of Good in visiting their poor Neighbours and giving them Cordials and suchlike insomuch that Colicks Agues and twenty Distempers nipp'd in the Bud fly before them So that I reckon the Doctors will soon be the only Enemies they have in the World For in a while there will be no Occasion for one within ten Miles of their Habitation  In this manner ran on Mr  Longman  to my inexpressible Delight you may believe and when he withdrew 'Tis an honest Soul said my dear Mr  B  I love him for his respectful Love to my Angel and his Value for the worthy Pair Very glad I am that every thing answers  their  Wishes May they long live and be happy  The dear Gentleman makes me spring to his Arms whenever he touches this String For he speaks always thus generously and kindly of you and is glad to hear he says that you don't live only to yourselves And nowandthen adds That your Prudence and mine do more Credit to his Choice than might have been done him by an Alliance with the first Quality Since every Mouth he is pleased to say is full of our Merits How pleasing how transporting rather my dear Parents must this Goodness be to your happy Daughter And how could I forbear repeating these kind Things to you that you may see how well every thing is taken that you do  When the expected Visit from Lord and Lady  Davers  is over the approaching Winter will carry us to  London  and as I shall then be nearer to you we may more frequently hear from one another which to be sure will be a great Heightening to my Pleasures  But I have such an Account given me of the Immoralities to which Persons are exposed there along  with the publick Diversions that it takes off a little from the Satisfaction I should otherwise have in the Thought of going thither For they say Quarrels and Duels and Gallantries as they are called so often happen at  London  that those Enormities are heard of without the least Wonder or Surprize  This makes me very thoughtful at times But God I hope will preserve our dearest Benefactor and continue to me his Affection and then I shall be always happy especially while your Healths and Felicity confirm and crown the Delights of  Your ever dutiful Daughter  P B  LETTER XXVI  My dearest Child  IT may not be improper to mention ourselves what the Nature of the Kindnesses is which we confer on our poor Neighbours and the labouring People lest it should be surmised by any body that we are lavishing away Wealth that is not our own Not that we fear either your honoured Husband or you will suspect any such Matter or that the worthy Mr  Longman  would insinuate as much for he saw what we did and was highly pleased with it and said he would make such a Report of it as you write he did What we do is in small Things tho' the Good we hope from them is not small perhaps And if a very distressful Case should happen among our poor Neighbours that would require any thing considerable and the Objects be deserving we would acquaint you with it and leave it to you to do as God shall direct you  But this indeed we have done and continue to do We have furnished ourselves with simple Waters  and Cordials of several Sorts and when in a hot sultry Day I see poor labouring Creatures ready to faint and drop down if they are only fatigued I order them a Mouthful of Bread or so and a Cup of good Ale or Beer and this makes them go about their Business with new Spirits and when they bless me for it I tell them they must bless the good 'Squire from whose Bounty next to God it all proceeds If any are ill I give them a Cordial and we have been the Means of setting up several poor Creatures who have labour'd under Colicky and Aguish Disorders or have been taken with slight Stomach Ailments And nothing is lost by it my dear Child for poor People have as grateful Souls as any body and it would delight your dear Heart to see how many drooping Spirits we have raised and how in an Hour or two some of them after a little cordial Refreshment from languishing under an Hedge or behind a Haystack have skipped about as nimble as Deer whistling and singing and pursuing with Alacrity their several Imployments and instead of cursing and swearing as is the Manner of some wicked Wretches nothing but Blessings and Praises poured out of their glad Hearts upon his Honour and you calling me their Father and Friend and telling me they will live and die for me and my Wife and that we shall never want an industrious Servant to do his Honour's Business or to cultivate the Farm I am blessed in And in like sort we communicate to our sick or wanting Neighbours even altho' they be not Tenants to the Estate  Come my dear Child you are happy very happy to be sure you are and if it  can  be may you be yet happier and happier But still I verily think you cannot be more happy than your Father and Mother except in this one thing That all  our  Happiness under God proceeds from you and as other Parents  bless their Children with Plenty and Benefits you have bless'd your Parents or your honoured Husband rather for your sake with all the good Things this World can afford  The Papers you send us are the Joy of our Leisure Hours and you are kind beyond all Expression in taking care to oblige us with them We know how your Time is taken up and ought to be very well contented if but nowandthen you let us hear of your Health and Welfare But it is not enough with such a good Daughter that you have made our Lives  comfortable  but you will make them  joyful  too by communicating to us all that befals you And then you write so piously and with such a Sense of God's Goodness to you and intermix such good Reflections in your Writings that whether it be our partial Love or not I cannot tell but truly we think nobody comes up to you And you make our Hearts and our Eyes so often overflow as we read that we join Hand in Hand together and I say to her Blessed be God and blessed be you my Dear and she in the same Breath Blessed be God and you my Love For such a Daughter says the one For such a Daughter says the other And she has your own sweet Temper cry I And she has your own honest Heart cries she And so we go on blessing God and blessing you and blessing your Spouse and blessing ourselves Is any Happiness like our Happiness my dear Daughter  Really and indeed we are so inraptur'd with your Writings that when our Spirits flag thro' the Infirmity of Years that have begun to take hold of us we have recourse to some of your Papers Come my Dear cry I what say you to a Banquet now She knows what I mean With all my Heart says she So I read altho' it be on a  Sunday  so good are your Letters and you must know I have Copies  of a many of them And after a little while we are as much alive and brisk as if we had had no Flagging at all and return to the Duties of the Day with double Delight  Consider then my dear Child what Joy your Writings give us And yet we are afraid of oppressing you who have so much to do of other Kinds and we are heartily glad you have found out a way to save Trouble to yourself and rejoice us and oblige so worthy a young Lady as Miss  Darnford  all at one time I never shall forget her dear Goodness to me and the Notice she took of me at the Hall  See  Vol II  p    kindly pressing my rough Hands with her fine Hands and looking in my Face with  so  much Kindness in her Eyesto be sure I never shall What good People as well as bad there are in high Stations Thank God there are else our poor Child would have had a sad Time of it too often when she was obliged to  step out of herself  as once I heard you phrase it into Company you could not  live with    Well but how shall I end And yet what shall I say more Only with my Prayers that God will continue to you the Blessings and Comforts you are in Possession of And pray now be not overthoughtful about what may happen at  London  for why should you let the Dread of future Evils lessen your present Joys There is no absolute Perfection in this Life that's true but one would make one's self as easy as one could 'Tis Time enough to be troubled when Troubles come  Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof  Rejoice then my dear Child as you have often said you would in your present Blessings and leave the Event of Things to the Supreme Disposer of all Events And what have  you  to do but rejoice  You  who cannot see a Sun rise but it is to bless you and to raise up from their Beds Numbers to join in the Blessing  You  who can bless your highborn Friends and your lowborn Parents and obscure Relations who can bless the Rich by your Example and the Poor by your Bounty and bless besides so good and so brave a Husband O my dear Child what let me repeat it have  you  to do but rejoice  For many Daughters have done wisely but you have excelled them all  I will only add that every thing the 'Squire order'd is just upon the Point of being finished And when the good Time comes that we shall be again favoured with his Presence and yours what a still greater Joy will this afford to the already overflowing Hearts of  Your ever loving Father and Mother  J  and  E ANDREWS  LETTER XXVII  My dear Miss  Darnford  THE Interest I take in every thing that concerns you makes me very importunate to know how you approve the Gentleman whom some of his best Friends and Wellwishers have recommended to your Favour I hope he will deserve your good Opinion and then he must excel most of the unmarried Gentlemen in  England    Your Papa in his humourous Manner mentions his large Possessions and Riches But indeed were he as rich as  Croesus  he should not have my Consent if he has no  greater  Merit tho' that is what the Generality of Parents look out for first And indeed an easy Fortune is so far from being disregardable that when attended with  equal  Merit I think it ought to have a  Preference  given to it supposing Affections  disingaged For 'tis certain that a Gentleman or Lady may stand as good a Chance for Happiness in Marriage with a Person of Fortune as with one who has not that Advantage and notwithstanding I had neither Riches nor Descent to boast of I must be of Opinion with those who say that they never knew any body despise either that had them But to permit Riches to be the  principal  Inducement to the Neglect of superior Merit that is the Fault which many a one smarts for whether the Choice be their own or imposed upon them by those who have a Title to their Obedience  Here is a saucy Body might some who have not Miss  Darnford  's kind Consideration for her Friend be apt to say who being thus meanly descended nevertheless presumes to give her Opinion in these high Cases unasked But I have one thing my dear Miss to say and that is that I think myself so intirely divested of Partiality to my own Case that as far as my Judgment shall permit I will never have that in View when I am presuming to hint my Opinion of general Rules For most surely the Honours I have received and the Debasement to which my best Friend has subjected himself have for their principal Excuse that the Gentleman was intirely independent had no Questions to ask and had a Fortune sufficient to make himself as well as the Person he chose happy tho' she brought him nothing at all and that he had moreover such a Character for good Sense and Knowlege of the World that nobody could impute to him any other Inducement but that of a noble Resolution to reward a Virtue he had so frequently and I will say so wickedly try'd and could not subdue  But why do I thus run on to Miss  Darnford  whose partial Friendship attributes to me Merits I cannot claim I will therefore quit this Subject as a  needless one to her and proceed to what was principally in my View when I began to write and that is to complain of your Papa who has let me say it done his Endeavour to set at Variance a Gentleman and his Wife  I will not enter into the Particulars because the Appeal is to  Caesar  and it would look like invading his Prerogative to take it into my own Hands But I can tell Sir  Simon  that he is the only Gentleman I hope who when a young Person of my Sex asked him to make her a Present of a Book would put such a mischievous Turn as he has done upon it to her HusbandIndeed from the  Beginning  I had Reason to call him a  See  Vol I  p    TelltaleBut no more of thatYet I must say I had rather he should have flung this Book at  my  Head too than to have made a so much worse Use of it But I came off tolerably no Thanks to Sir  Simon  howeverAnd  but  tolerably neither For my dear Mr  B  kept me in Suspense a good while and put me in great Flutters before he let me into the Matter  But I was very much concerned my dear Miss at first till you gave a Reason I better liked afterwards for Sir  Simon  's denying your Company to me after I had obtain'd the Favour of your Mamma's Consent and you were kindly inclin'd yourself to oblige me And that was that Sir  Simon  had a bad Opinion of the Honour of my dear Mr  B  For as to that Part of his Doubt which reflected Dishonour upon his dear Daughter it was all but the Effect of his strange free Humour on purpose to vex you  That Gentleman must be the most abandon'd of Men who would attempt any thing against the Virtue of a Lady intrusted to his Protection And I am  grieved methinks that the dear Gentleman who is the better Part of myself and has to his own Debasement acted so honourably by me should be thought capable of so much Vileness But forgive me Miss it is only Sir  Simon  I dare say who could think so hardly of him And I am in great Hope for the Honour of the  present  Age quite contrary to the Aspersion that every Age grows worse and worse that the  last  if it produc'd People capable of such Attempts was wickeder than this  Bad as my dear Mr  B  's Designs and Attempts were upon me I can now I am set above fearing them and am inabled to reflect upon them with less Terror and Apprehension be earnest for his own dear sake to think him not even  then  the worst of Men tho' bad enough in all Conscience For have we not heard of those that have had no Remorse or Compunction at all and have actually executed all their vile Purposes when a poor Creature was in their PowerYet indeed after sore Trials that's true did not God turn his Heart And altho' I was still helpless and without any Friend in the World and in the Hands of a poor vile Woman who to be sure was worse than he provoking him to ruin me and so wholly in his Power that I durst not disobey him whether he bid me come to him or be gone from him as he was pleased or displeased with me yet I say for all this did he not overcome his criminal Passion and entertain an honourable one tho' to his poor Servant Girl and brave the World and the World's Censures and marry me  And does not this shew that the Seeds of Honour were kept alive in his Heart tho' choaked or kept from sprouting forth for a Time by the Weeds of Sensuality Pride and youthful Impetuosity And by cutting down the latter have not the former  taken Root have they not shot out and in their turn  kept down  at least the depressed Weeds And who now lives more virtuously than Mr  B    Let me tell you my dear Miss that I have not heard of many Instances of Gentlemen who having designed vilely have stopt short and acted so honourably and who continue to act so nobly And I have great Confidence that he will in time be as pious as he is now moral for tho' he has a few bad Notions which he talks of nowandthen as Polygamy and suchlike which indeed give me a little serious Thought sometimes because a Man is too apt to practise what he has persuaded himself to believe is no Crime yet I hope they are owing more to the Liveliness of his Wit a wild Quality which does not always confine itself to proper Exercises than to his Judgment And if I can but see the first three or four Months Residence over in that wicked  London  which they say is so seducing a Place without adding to my Apprehensions how happy shall I be  So much slightly have I thought proper to say in behalf of my dear Mr  B  For a good Wife cannot but hope for a sweeter and more elevated Companionship if her presumptuous Heart makes her look upward with Hope herself than this transitory State can afford us And what a sad Case is hers who being as exemplary as human Frailty will permit her to be looks forward upon the Partner of her adverse and of her prosperous Estate the Husband of her Bosom the Father of her Children the Head of her Family as a poor unhappy Soul destin'd to a separate and a miserable Existence for everO my dear MissHow can such a Thought be supportableBut what high Consolation what Transport rather at times must hers be who shall be bless'd with the Hope of being an humble Instrument to reclaim such a dear dear thrice dear  Partner And that Heart in Heart and Hand in Hand they shall one Day issue forth from this incumbred State into a blessed Eternity benefited by each other's ExampleI will lay down my Pen and injoy the rich Thought for a few Moments  Now my dear Miss let me as a Subject very pleasing to me touch upon your kind Mention of the worthy Mr  Peters  's Sentiments in relation to that Part of his Conduct to me which oppress'd by the Terrors and Apprehensions to which I was subjected once indeed I censured and so much the readier as I had ever so great an Honour for his Cloth that I thought to be a Clergyman and all that was compassionate good and virtuous was the same thing  But when I came to know Mr  Peters  I had a high Opinion of his Worthiness and as no one can be perfect in this Life thus I thought to myself How hard was then my Lot to be a Cause of Stumbling to so worthy a Heart To be sure a Gentleman who knows so well and practises so well his Duty in every other Instance and preaches it so efficaciously to others must have been  one Day  sensible that it would not have misbecome his Function and Character to have afforded that Protection to oppressed Innocence which was requested of him and how would it have grieved his considerate Mind had my Ruin been completed that he did not  But as he had once a Namesake as one may say that failed in a much greater Instance let not my Want of Charity exceed his Fault but let me look upon it as an Infirmity to which the most perfect are liable I was a Stranger to him a Servant Girl carry'd off by her Master a young Gentleman of violent and lawless Passions who in this very Instance  shew'd how much in Earnest he was set upon effecting all his vile Purposes and whose Heart altho'  God  might touch it was not probable any lesser Influence could  Then he was not sure that tho' he might assist my Escape I might not afterwards fall again into the Hands of so determin'd a Violator and that Difficulty would not with such an one inhance his Resolution to overcome all Obstacles  Moreover he might think that the Person who was moving him to this worthy Measure might possibly be seeking to gratify a View of his own and that while he was endeavouring to save to outwatd Appearance a Virtue in Danger he was in reality only helping at the Hazard of exposing himself to the Vindictiveness of a violent Temper and a rich Neighbour who had Power as well as Will to resent another to a Wife for such was his  Vol I  p    l    Apprehension groundless intirely groundless as it was tho' not improbable as it might seem to him  Then again the sad Examples set by too many  European  Sovereigns in whom the  Royal  and  Priestly Offices  are united for are not Kings the  Lord's Anointed  and the little Scruple which many Persons Right Reverend by their Functions and Characters too generally make to pay sordid Court and Visits far from bearing their Testimony against such Practices even to Concubines who have Interest to promote them  That these Arguments were pleaded by Mr  Peters  See  Vol I  p    l  c  are no small Discouragements to a private Clergyman to do his Duty and to make himself Enemies among his powerful Neighbours for the Cause of Virtue And especially forgive me dear Sir  Simon Darnford  if you should  see this when an eminent Magistrate one of the principal Gentlemen of the County of an independent Fortune who had fine young Ladies to his Daughters who had nothing but their superior Conditions not their Sex to exempt them from like Attempts a Justice of Peace and of the  Quorum  refused to BE a  See  Vol I  p    l    Justice tho' such a Breach of the  Peace  was made and such a Violation of  Morals  plainly intended This I say must add to the Discouragement of a Gentleman a little too diffident and timorous of himself And who having no one to second him had he afforded me his Protection must have stood alone in the Gap and made to himself in an active Gentleman an Enemy who had a thousand desirable Qualities to make one wish him for a Friend  For all these Considerations I think my self obliged to pity rather than too rigorously to censure the worthy Gentleman And I must and will always respect him And thank him a thousand times my dear Miss in my Name for his Goodness in condescending to acknowlege by your dear Hand his Infirmity as such For this gives an excellent Proof of the natural Worthiness of his Heart and that it is beneath him to seek to extenuate a Fault when he thinks he has committed one  Indeed my dear Friend I have so much Honour for the Clergy of all Degrees that I never forget in my Prayers one Article That God will make them burning and shining Lights to the World since so much depends on their Ministry and Examples as well with respect to our publick as private Duties Nor shall the Faults of a Few make Impression upon me to the Disadvantage of the Order For I am afraid a very censorious Temper in this respect is too  generally the Indication of an uncharitable and perhaps a profligate Heart levelling Characters in order to cover some inward Pride or secret Enormities which they are ashamed to avow and will not be instructed to amend  Forgive my dear Miss this tedious Scribble I cannot for my Life write short Letters to those I love And let me hope that you will favour me with an Account of your new Affair and how you proceed in it and with such of your Conversations as may give me some Notion of a polite Courtship For alas my dear Miss your poor Friend knows nothing of this All her Courtship was sometimes a hasty Snatch of the Hand a black and blue Gripe of the Arm and Whither nowCome to me when I bid youAnd Saucyface and Creature and suchlike on his Partwith Fear and Trembling on mine andI will I willGood Sir have Mercy At other times a Scream and nobody to hear or mind me and with uplift Hands bent Knees and tearful EyesFor God's sake pity your poor Servant  This my dear Miss was the hard Treatment that attended my CourtshipPray then let me know how Gentlemen court their Equals in Degree how they look when they address you with their Knees bent sighing supplicating and  all that  as Sir  Simon  says with the Words Slave Servant Admirer continually at their Tongues Ends  But after all it will be found I believe that be the Language and Behaviour ever so obsequious it is all designed to end alikeThe  English  the plain  English  of the politest Address is I am now dear Madam your humble Servant Pray be so good as to let me be your Master Yes and thank you too says the Lady's Heart tho' not her Lips if she likes him And so they go to Church together And in  Conclusion it will be happy if these obsequious Courtships end no worse than my frightful one  But I am convinc'd that with a Man of Sense a Woman of tolerable Prudence  must  be happy  That whenever you marry it may be to such a Man who then must value you as you deserve and make you as happy as I now am notwithstanding all that's past wishes and prays  Your obliged Friend and Servant  P B  N B  Altho' Miss  Darnford  could not receive the above Letter so soon as to answer it before others were sent to her by her fair Correspondent yet we think it not amiss to dispense with the Order of Time that the Reader may have the Letter and Answer at one View And shall on other Occasions take the like Liberty  LETTER XXVIII In Answer to the preceding  My dear Mrs  B  YOU charm us all with your Letters Mr  Peters  says he will never go to bed nor rise but he will pray for you and desires I will return his thankful Acknowlegements for your favourable Opinion of him and kind Allowances If there be an Angel on Earth he says you are one My Papa altho' he has seen your stinging Reflection upon his Refusal to protect you is delighted with you too and says when you come down to  Lincolnshire  again he will be  undertaken  by you in good Earnest for he thinks he was wrong to deny you his Protection  We are pleas'd with your Apology for Mr  B  'Tis so much the Part of a good Wife to extenuate her Husband's Faults and make the best of his bad Qualities in order to give the World a good Opinion of him that together with the affecting Instances of your Humility in looking back with so much true Greatness of Mind to what you were make us all join to admire you and own that nobody can deserve what you deserve  Yet I am sorry my dear Friend to find notwithstanding your Defence of Mr  B  that you have any Apprehensions about  London  'Tis pity any thing should give you Concern As to Mr  B  's talking in Favour of Polygamy you cannot expect that he can shake off all his bad Notions at once And it must be a great Comfort to you that his  Actions  do not correspond and that his Liberties have been reduced to  Notions  only In time we hope that he will be every thing you wish him If not with such an Example before him he will be the more culpable  We all smiled at the Description of your own uncommon Courtship And as they say the Days of Courtship are the happiest Part of Life if we had not known that your Days of Marriage are happier by far than any other body's Courtship we must needs have pity'd you But as the one were Days of Trial and Temptation the other are Days of Reward and Happiness May the last always continue to be so and you'll have no Occasion to think any body happier than Mrs  B  I thank you heartily for your good Wishes as to the Man of Sense Mr  Murray  has been here and continues his Visits He is a lively Gentleman well enough in his Person has a tolerable Character yet loves Company and will take his Bottle freely my Papa likes him ne'er the worse for that He talks a good deal dresses gay and even richly and seems to  like his own Person very well No great Pleasure this for a Lady to look forward to yet he falls far short of that genteel Ease and graceful Behaviour which distinguish your Mr  B  from any body I know  I wish Mr  Murray  would apply to my Sister She is an illnatur'd Girl but would make a good Wife I hope and I fansy she'd like him well enough I can't say I do He laughs too much has something boisterous in his Conversation his Complaisance is not a pretty Complaisance He is well vers'd in Country Sports and my Papa loves him for that too and says He is a most accomplish'd Gentleman Yes cry I as Gentlemen goYou  must  be saucy says Sir  Simon  and when a Partrige is put on your Plate snuff up your Nose at it when were you kept a little hungry you'd have leapt at a coarser Bird  I know some Gentlemens Partriges Sir cry'd I no better than rank Wigeons and far short of a Stubble Goose He call'd me one of his free Names  But I have broken my Mind to my dear my indulgent Mamma who tells me she will do me all the Pleasure she can but would be loth the youngest Daughter should  go first  as she calls it But if I could come and live with you a little nowandthen I did not care who marry'd unless such an one offer'd as I never expect  I have great Hope the Gentleman will be easily persuaded to quit me for  Nancy  for I see he has not Delicacy enough to love with any great Distinction He says as my Mamma tells me by the bye that I am the handsomest and best humour'd and he has found out as he thinks that I have some Wit and have Ease and Freedom and he tacks Innocence to them in my Address and Conversation 'Tis well for me  he  is of this Opinion for if he thinks justly which I much question  any body  may think so still much more for I have been far from taking  Pains to ingage his good Word having been under more Reserve to him than ever I was before to any body  Indeed I can't help it for the Gentleman is forward without Delicacy and pardon me Sir  Simon  my Papa has not one bit of it neither But is for pushing Matters on with his rough Raillery that puts me out of Countenance and has already adjusted the sordid Part of the Preliminaries as he tells me  Yet I hope  Nancy  's  l  Fortune more than I am likely to have  See  Vol II  p    will give her the wish'dfor Preference with Mr  Murray  and then as to a Brotherinlaw in Prospect I can put off all Restraint and return to my usual Freedom  This is all that occurs worthy of Notice from us But from you we expect an Account of Lady  Davers  's Visit and of the Conversations that offer among you and you have so delightful a way of making every thing momentous either by your Subject or Reflections or both that we long for every PostDay in hopes of the Pleasure of a Letter And yours I will always carefully preserve as so many Testimonies of the Honour I receive in this Correspondence Which will be always esteemed as it deserves by my dear Mrs  B  Your obliged and faithful  POLLY DARNFORD  Mrs  Peters  Mrs  Jones  my Papa Mamma and Sister present their due Respects Mr  Peters  I mentioned before He continues to give a very good Account of poor  Jewkes  and is much pleased with her  LETTER XXIX  My dear Miss  Darnford  AT your Desire and to oblige your honoured Mamma and your good Neighbours I will now acquaint you with the Arrival of Lady  Davers  and will wri  e what passes between us I will not say worthy of Notice for were I to do so I should be more brief perhaps by much than you seem to expect But as my Time is pretty much taken up and I find I shall be obliged to write a Bit now and a Bit then you must excuse me if I dispense with some Forms which I ought to observe when I write to one I so dearly love and so I will give it Journalwise as it were and have no Regard when it would fetter or break in upon my Freedom of Narration to Inscription or Subscription but send it as I have Opportunity And if you please to favour me so far as to lend it me after you have read the Stuff for the Perusal of my Father and Mother to whom my Duty and Promise require me to give an Account of my Proceedings it will save me Transcription for which I shall have no Time and then you will excuse Blots and Blurs and I will trouble myself no further for Apologies on that score but this one for all  If you think it worth while when they have read it you shall have it again  Wednesday  Morning Six o'Clock  FOR my dear Friend permits me to rise an Hour sooner than my Wont that I may have Time to scribble for he is always pleased to see me so imploy'd or in Reading often saying when I am at my Needle as his Sister once wrote  See this Vol  p  Your Maids  can do this  Pamela  but they cannot write as you can And yet as he tells me when I chuse to follow my Needle as a Diversion from too intense Study as he is pleased to call it but alas I know not what Study is as may be easily guessed by my hasty writing putting down every thing as it comes I shall then do as I please But you must understand I promised at setting out what a good Wife I'd endeavour to make  See  Vol II  p    And every honest body should try to be as good as their Word you know and such Particulars as I then mentioned I think I ought to dispense with as little as possible especially as I promised no more than what was my Duty to perform if I had  not  promised But what a Preamble is hereJudge by it what Impertinences you may expect as I proceed  Yesterday about Six in the Evening arrived here my Lord and Lady  Davers  their Nephew and the Countess of  C  Mother of Lady  Betty  whom we did not expect but took it for the greater Favour It seems her Ladyship long'd as she said to see  me  and this was her principal Inducement The two Ladies and their two Women were in Lord  Davers  's Coach and Six and my Lord and his Nephew rode on Horseback attended with a Train of Servants  We had expected them to Dinner but they could not reach Time enough for the Countess being a little incommoded with her Journey the Coach travelled slowly My Lady would not suffer her Lord nor his Nephew to come hither before her tho' on Horseback because she would be present she said when his Lordship first saw me he having quite forgot  her Mother's Pamela  that was her Word  It rained when they came in so the Coach drove directly to the Door Mr  B  receiving them there But I was in a little Sort of Flutter which Mr  B  observing made me sit down in the Parlour to compose myself Where's  Pamela  said my Lady as soon as she alighted in the Passage  I stept out lest she should take it amiss and she took my Hand and kissed me Here my Lady Countess said she presenting me to her Here's the Girl see if I said too much in Praise of her Person  The Countess saluted me with a kind Pleasure in her Eye and said Indeed Lady  Davers  you have not 'Twould have been strange excuse me Mrs  B  for I know your Story if such a fine Flower had not been transplanted from the Field to the Garden  I made no Return but by a low Court'sy to her Ladyship's Compliment Then Lady  Davers  takeing my Hand again presented me to her Lord See here my Lord my Mother's  Pamela  And see here my Lord said her generous Brother taking my other Hand most kindly see here your Brother's  Pamela  too  My Lord saluted me I do said he to his Lady I do said he to his Brother and I see the first Person in her that has exceeded my Expectation when every Mouth had  prepared  me to expect a Wonder  Mr  H  whom every one calls Lord  Jackey  after his Aunt's Example when she is in good Humour with him and who is a very  young  Gentleman tho' about as old as my best Friend came to me next and said Lovelier and lovelier by my Life I never saw your Peer Madam  Will you excuse me Miss all this seeming Vanity for the sake of repeating exactly what passed  Well but said my Lady taking my Hand in her free Quality Way which quite dashed me and holding it at Distance and turning me halfround her Eye fixed to my Waist Let me observe you a little my sweetfac'd Girl I hope I am right I hope you will do Credit to my Brother as he has done you CreditWhy do you let her lace so tight Mr  B  I was unable to look up as you may believe Miss my Face all over Scarlet was hid in my Bosom and I looked so silly  Ay said my naughty Lady you may well look down my good Girl For to talk to thee in thy own grave Way thou hast verify'd the Scripture  What is done in Secret shall be known on the Housetop    Dear my Lady said I for still she kept looking at me And her dear Brother seeing my Confusion in Pity to me press'd my blushing Face a Moment on his generous Breast and said Lady  Davers  you should not be thus hard upon my dear Girl the Moment you see her and before so many Witnesses But look up my best Love take your Revenge of my Sister and tell her you wish her in the same Way  It is so then said my Lady I'm glad of it with all my Heart I will now love you still better but I almost doubted it seeing her still so slender But if my good Child you lace too tight I'll never forgive you And so she gave me a Kiss of Congratulation as she said  Do you think Miss I did not look very sillyMy Lord smiling and gazing at me from Head to Foot Lord  Jackey  grinning and laughing like an Oaf as I then in my Spite thought Indeed the Countess said incouragingly to me but severely on Persons of Birth Lady  Davers  you are as much too teizing  as Mrs  B  is too bashful But you're a happy Man Mr  B  that your Lady's Modesty and Bashfulness are the only Marks by which we can judge she is not of Quality Lord  Jackey  in the Language of some Character in a Play cry'd out  A palpable Hit by  Jupiter and laughed egregiously running about from one to another repeating the same Words  We talked only upon common Topicks till Suppertime and I was all Ear as I thought it became me for the Countess had by her first Compliment and by an Aspect as noble as intelligent obliged me to Silence in Awe of a Superiority so visible as had Lady  Davers  's free though pleasant Raillery which she could not help carrying on nowandthen Besides Lady  Davers  's Letters had given me greater Reason to revere her Wit and Judgment high as my Respect for her before had carried my Notions of her Excellence that I had formed to myself when I reflected on her passionate Temper and such Parts of the Conversation I had had with her Ladyship in your Neighbourhood which however to be admired fell short of her Letters  When we were to sit down at Table I looked I suppose a little diffidently for I really then thought of my Lady's Anger at the Hall when she would not have permitted me to sit at Table with her  See  Vol II  p    and Mr  B  saying Take your Place my Dear you keep our Friends standing I sat down in my usual Place And my Lady  said  None of your reproaching Eye  Pamela  I know what you hint at And every Letter I have receiv'd from you has help'd to make me censure myself for my  LadyAirs  as you call 'em you Saucebox you I told you I'd  LadyAirs  you when I saw you and you shall have it all in good Time  I'm sure said I I shall have nothing from your Ladyship but what will be very agreeable But indeed I never meant any thing particular by that or any other Word that I wrote nor could I think of any thing but what was highly respectful to your Ladyship  Lord  Davers  was pleased to say that it was impossible I should either write or speak any thing that could be taken amiss  Lady  Davers  after Supper and the Servants were withdrawn began a Discourse on Titles and said Brother I think you should hold yourself obliged to my Lord  Davers  for he has spoken to Lord  S  who made him a Visit a few Days ago to procure you a Baronet's Patent Your Estate and the Figure you make in the World are so considerable and your Family besides is so antient that methinks you should wish for some Distinction of that Sort  Yes Brother said my Lord I did mention it to Lord  S  and told him withal that it was without your Knowlege or Desire that I spoke about it and I was not very sure you would accept of it but 'tis a thing your Sister has wish'd for a good while  What Answer did my Lord  S  make to it said Mr  B  He said We meaning the Ministers I suppose should be glad to oblige a Gentleman of Mr  B  's Figure in the World but you mention it so slightly that you can hardly expect Courtiers will tender it to any Gentleman that is so indifferent about it for Lord  Davers  we seldom grant Honours without a View I tell you that said he smiling  My Lord  S  might mention this as a Jest return'd Mr  B  but he spoke the Truth But your Lordship said well that I was indifferent about it 'Tis true 'tis an hereditary Title But the rich Citizens who  used to be satisfy'd with the Title of Knights till they made it so common that it was brought into as great Contempt as the  This Order was become so scandalously common in  France  that in order to suppress it the Hangman was vested with the Ensigns of it which effectually abolished it  French  Knights of St  Michael  and nobody else cared to accept of it now are ambitious of this and I take it it is hastening apace into like Disrepute Besides 'tis a novel Honour and what our Ancestors who lived at its Institution would never accept of But were it a Peerage they would give me which has some essential Privileges and Splendors attached to it that would make it desirable to some Men I would not enter into Conditions for it Titles at best added he are but Shadows and he that has the Substance should be above valuing them for who that has the whole Bird would pride himself upon a single Feather  But said my Lady altho' I acknowlege that the Institution is of late Date yet as abroad as well as at home it is regarded as a Title of Dignity and it is supposed that the best Families among the Gentry are of it I should be glad you would accept of it And as to Citizens being of it they are not many and some of them or their immediate Descendants however have bought themselves into the Peerage itself of the one Kingdom or the other  As to what it is looked upon Abroad said Mr  B  that is of no Weight at all for when an  Englishman  travels be he of what Degree he will if he has an Equipage and squanders his Money away he is a Lord of course with Foreigners And therefore Sir  Suchaone  is rather a Diminution to him as it fixes him down to a lower Title than his Vanity would perhaps make him aspire to be thought in the Possession of Then as to Citizens in a Trading Nation like this I am not displeased in the main with seeing  the overgrown ones creeping into nominal Honours and we have so many of our first Titled Families who have ally'd themselves to Trade whose Inducements were Money only that it ceases to be either a Wonder as to the Fact or a Disgrace to the Honour  Well Brother said my Lady I will tell you further the Thing may be had for asking for If you will but go to Court and desire to kiss the King's Hand that will be all the Trouble you'll have and pray now oblige me in it  If a Title would make me either a better or a wiser Man reply'd Mr  B  I would imbrace it with Pleasure Besides I am not so intirely satisfied with some of the Measures now pursuing as to owe any Obligation to the Ministers Accepting of a small Title from them is but like putting on their Badge or listing under their Banners like a certain Lord we all know who accepted of one Degree more of Title to shew he was theirs and would not have a higher lest it should be thought a Satisfaction tantamount to half the Pension he demanded And could I be easy to have it supposed that I was an ingrateful Man for voting as I pleased because they gave me the Title of a Baronet  The Countess said The World always thought Mr  B  was a Gentleman of moderate Principles and not attached to any Party and it was her Opinion that it was far from being inconsistent with any Gentleman's Honour and Independency to accept of a Title from a Prince he acknowleged as his Sovereign  'Tis very true Madam reply'd Mr  B  that I am attach'd to no Party and never will and I have a mean Opinion of many of the Heads of both Nay I will say further that I wish at my Heart the Gentlemen in the Administration would pursue such  Measures that I could give them every Vote as I always will every one that I can and I have no very high Opinion of those who right or wrong would distress or imbarass a Government For this is certain that our Governors cannot be always in the wrong and he therefore who never gives them a Vote must probably be as often out of the Way as they and must moreover have some View he will not own But in a Country like ours where each of the Legislative Powers is in a Manner independent and where they are designed as mutual Checks upon each other I have notwithstanding so great an Opinion of the Necessity of an Opposition sometimes that I am convinc'd it is that which must preserve our Constitution I will therefore be a  Country Gentleman  in the true Sense of the Word and will accept of no Favour that shall make any one think I would  not  be of the Opposition when I think it a necessary one as on the other hand I should scorn to make myself a Round to any Man's Ladder of Preferment or a Caballer for the sake of my own  You say well Brother return'd Lady  Davers  but you may undoubtedly keep your own Principles and Independency and yet pay your Duty to the King and accept of this Title for your Family and Fortune will be a greater Ornament to the Title than the Title to you  Then what Occasion have I for it if that be the Case Madam  Why I can't say but I should be glad you had it for your Family's sake as it is an hereditary Honour Then it would mend the Style of your Spouse here for the good Girl is at such a Loss for an Epithet when she writes that I see the Constraint she lies under It is  My dear Gentleman My best Friend My Benefactor My dear Mr  B whereas Sir  William  would turn off her Periods more roundly and no other softer Epithet would be wanting  To me reply'd he who always desire to be distinguished as my  Pamela  's best Friend and think it an Honour to be called  her dear Mr  B and  her dear Gentleman  this Reason weighs very little unless there were no other Sir  William  in the Kingdom than her Sir  William  for I am very emulous of her Favour I can tell you and think it no small Distinction  I blushed at this too great Honour before such Company and was afraid my Lady would be a little piqu'd at it But after a Pause she said Well then Brother will you let  Pamela  decide upon this Point  Rightly put said the Countess Pray let Mrs  B  chuse for you Sir My Lady has hit the Thing  Very good very good by my Soul says Lord  Jackey  let my  young Aunt  that was his Word chuse for you Sir  Well then  Pamela  said the dear Gentleman give us  your  Opinion as to this Point  But first said Lady  Davers  say you will be determin'd by it or else she will be laid under a Difficulty  Well then reply'd he be it so I will be determined by your Opinion my Dear Give it me freely  Lord  Jackey  rubb'd his Hands together Charming charming as I hope to live By  Jove  this is just as I wish'd  Well now  Pamela  said my Lady speak your true Heart without Disguise I charge you do  Why then Gentlemen and Ladies said I if I must be so bold as to speak on a Subject upon which on several Accounts it would become me to be silent I should be  against  the Title but perhaps  my Reason is of too private a Nature to weigh any thing and if so it would not become me to have any Choice at all  They all called upon me for my Reason and I said looking down a little abash'd It is this Here my dear Mr  B  has disparag'd himself by distinguishing as he has done such a low Body as I and the World will be apt to say he is seeking to repair  one way  the Honour he has lost  another  and then perhaps it will be attributed to  my  Pride and Ambition Here they will be apt to say the proud Cottager will needs be a Lady in Hopes to conceal her Descent whereas had I such a vain Thought it would be but makeing it the more remember'd against both my dear Mr  B  and myself And indeed as to my own Part added I I take too much Pride in having been lifted up into this Distinction for the Causes to which I owe it your Brother's  Bounty  and  Generosity  than to be ashamed of what I  was  Only nowandthen I am concerned for his own sake lest he should be too much censur'dBut this would not be prevented by the Title but rather would be aggravated by it So I am humbly of Opinion against the Title  The dear Gentleman had hardly Patience to hear me out but came to me and folding his Arms about me said Just as I wish'd have you answer'd my beloved  Pamela  I was never yet deceiv'd in you no not once  My Lady Countess my Lord  Davers  my Lady  Davers  said the dear Gentleman do we want any Titles think you to make us happy but what we can confer upon ourselves And he press'd my Hand to his Lips as he always honours me most in Company and went to his Place highly pleas'd while his fine Manner drew Tears from my Eyes and made his noble Sister's and the Countess's glisten too  My Lady said Well for my Part thou art a strange Girl Where as my Brother once said  See  Vol I  p    gottest thou all this Then pleasantly humourous as if she was angry she changed her Tone What signify thy  meek  Words and  humble  Speeches when by thy  Actions  as well as  Sentiments  thou reflectest upon us all  Pamela  said she have less Merit or take care to conceal it better I shall otherwise have no more Patience with thee than thy Monarch has just now shewn  The Countess was pleased to say You're a happy Couple indeed and I must needs repeat to you Mr  B  four Lines that Sir  William Davenant  made upon a Lady who could not possibly deserve them so much as yours does  She ne'er saw Courts but Courts could have outdone  With untaught Looks and an unpractis'd Heart  Her Nets the most prepar'd could never shun  For  Nature  spread them in the Scorn of  Art    But my dear Miss how lucky one sometimes is in having what one says well accepted Ay that is all in all For the Reason for the Answer I gave was so obvious that one in my Circumstances could not miss it Yet what Compliments had I upon it 'Tis a Sign they were prepared to think well of me and that's my great Pleasure and Happiness  Such sort of Entertainment as this you are to expect from your Correspondent I cannot do better than I can and it may appear such a Mixture of Selfpraise Vanity and Impertinence that I expect you will tell me freely as soon as this comes to your Hand whether it be tolerable to you Yet I must write on for my dear Father and Mother's sake  who require it of me and are prepared to approve of every thing that comes from me for no other Reason but that And I think you ought to leave me to write to them only as I cannot hope it will be entertaining to any body else without expecting as much Partiality and Favour from others as I have from my dear Parents Mean time I conclude here my first Conversationpiece and am and will be  Always Yours c  P B  LETTER XXX  Thursday  Morning Six o'Clock  OUR Breakfast Conversation Yesterday at which only Mrs  Worden  my Lady's Woman and my  Polly  attended was so whimsically particular tho' I doubt some of it at least will appear too trifling that I cannot help acquainting my dear Miss  Darnford  with it who is desirous of knowing all that relates to Lady  Davers  's Conduct towards me  You must know then that I have the Honour to stand very high in the Graces of Lord  Davers  who on every Occasion is pleased to call me his  good Sister  his  dear Sister  and sometimes his  charming Sister  and he tells me he will not be out of my Company for an Hour together while he stays here if he can help it  My Lady seems to relish this very well in the main tho' she cannot quite so readily yet frame her Mouth to the Sound of the Word  Sister  as my Lord does of which this that follows is one Instance  His Lordship had called me by that tender Name twice before and saying I will drink another Dish I think my  good Sister  my Lady said Your Lordship has got a Word by the End that you seem mighty fond of I have taken Notice that you have called  Pamela Sister Sister Sister  no less than Three times in a Quarter of an Hour  My Lord looked a little serious I shall one Day or other said he be allow'd to chuse my own Words and Phrases I hope Your Sister Mr  B  added he often questions whether I am at Age or not tho' the House of Peers made no Scruple of admitting me among them some Years ago  Mr  B  said severely but with a smiling Air 'Tis well she has such a Gentleman as your Lordship for a Husband whose affectionate Indulgence overlooks all her saucy Sallies I am sure when you took her out of our Family into your own we all thought ourselves bound to pray for you  I thought this a great Trial of my Lady's Patience But it was from Mr  B  And she said with a halfpleasant halfserious Air How now Confidence None but my Brother could have said this whose violent Spirit was always much more intolerable than mine But I can tell you Mr  B  I was always thought very goodhumour'd and obliging to every body till your Impudence came from College and from your Travels and then I own your provoking Ways made me nowandthen a little out of the Way  Well well Sister we'll have no more of this Subject only let us see that my Lord  Davers  wants not his proper Authority with you altho' you used to keep me in Awe formerly  Keep you in Awe That nobody could ever do yet Boy or Man But my Lord I beg your Pardon for this Brother will make Mischief betwixt  us if he can I only took Notice of the Word  Sister  so often us'd which looked more like Affectation than Affection  Perhaps Lady  Davers  said my Lord gravely I have two Reasons for using the Word so frequently  I'd be glad to hear them said the dear taunting Lady for I don't doubt they're mighty good ones What are they my Lord  One is Because I love and am fond of my new Relation The other That you are so sparing of the Epithet that I call her so for us both  Your Lordship says well rejoin'd my dear Mr  B  smiling and Lady  Davers  can give two Reasons why she does  not    Well said my Lady now we are in for't let us hear  your  two Reasons likewise I doubt not they're wise ones too  If they are  yours  Lady  Davers  they must be so One is That every Condescension of a proud Lady to speak in her own Dialect comes as hard and as difficult as a Favour from the House of  Austria  to the petty Princes of  Germany  The second Because of your Sex excuse me my Lady Countess who having once made Scruples think it inconsistent with themselves to be overhasty to alter their own Conduct chusing rather to persist in an Error than own it to be one  This proceeded from the dear Gentleman's Impatience to see me in the least slighted by my Lady And I said to Lord  Davers  to soften Matters Never my Lord were Brother and Sister so loving in Earnest and yet so satirical upon each other in Jest as my good Lady and Mr  B  But your Lordship knows their Way  My Lady frown'd at her Brother but turn'd it off with an Air I love the Mistress of this House said she very well and am quite reconcil'd to her But  methinks there is such a hissing Sound in the Word  Sister  that I cannot abide it 'Tis a true  English  Word and a Word I have not been used to having never had a Sissster before as you know Speaking the first Syllable of the Word with an emphatical Hiss  Mr  B  said Observe you not Lady  Davers  that you used a Word to avoid that which had twice the Hissing in it that  Sister  hadand that was Missstress with two other hissing Words to accompany it of thisss Houssse But what childish Follies does not Pride make one stoop to Excuse my Lady to the Countess such poor low Conversation as we are dwindled into  O Sir said her Ladyship the Conversation is very agreeable and I think Lady  Davers  you're fairly caught  Well said my Lady then help me good  Sister  there's for you to a little Sugar Will that please you Sir  I am always pleas'd reply'd her Brother smiling when Lady  Davers  acts up to her own Character and the good Sense she is Mistress of  Ay ay return'd she my good Brother like other wise Men takes it for granted that it is a Mark of good Sense to approve of whatever  he  does And so for this one Time I am a very sensible body with him And I'll leave off while I have his good Word Only one thing I must say to you my Dear turning to me That tho' I call you  Pamela  and  Pamela  as I please I do assure you I love you as well as if I called you  Sister Sister  as Lord  Davers  does at every Word  Your Ladyship gives me great Pleasure said I in this kind Assurance and I don't doubt but I shall have the Honour of being called by that tender Name if I can be so happy as to deserve it and  I'll lose no Opportunity that shall be afforded me to shew how sincerely I will endeavour to do so  She was pleased to rise from her Seat Give me a Kiss my dear Girl you deserve every thing And permit me to say  Pamela  sometimes as the Word occurs for I am not used to speak in Print and I will call you  Sister  when I think of it and love you as well as ever Sister loved another  These proud and passionate Folks said my dear Mr  B  how good they can be when they reflect a little on what becomes their Characters  So then said my Lady I am to have no Merit of my own I see do what I will This is not quite so generous in my Brother  Why you saucy Sister said he excuse me Lord  Davers  what Merit  would  you have Can People merit by doing their Duty And is it so great a Praise that you think fit to own for a Sister so deserving a Girl as this whom I take Pride in calling my Wife  Thou art what thou always wast return'd my Lady and were I in this my imputed Pride to want an Excuse I know not the Creature living that ought so soon to make one for me as you  I  do  excuse you said he for  that  very Reason if you please But it little becomes either your Pride or mine to do any thing that wants Excuse  Mighty moral mighty grave truly  Pamela  Friend Sisterthere's for you thou art a happy Girl to have made such a Reformation in thy honest Man's way of  Thinking  as well as  Acting  But now we are upon this Topick and none but Friends about us I am resolved to be even with thee Brother  Jackey  if you are not for another Dish I wish you'd withdraw  Polly Barlow  we don't want you  Beck  you may stay Mr  H  obey'd and  Polly  went out For you must know Miss that my Lady  Davers  will have none of the MenFellows as she  calls them to attend upon us at Tea And I cannot say but I think her intirely in the right for several Reasons that might be given  When they were withdrawn my Lady repeated Now we are upon this Topick of Reclaiming and Reformation tell me thou bold Wretch for you know I have seen all your Rogueries in  Pamela  's Papers tell me if ever Rake but thyself made such an Attempt as thou didst on this dear good Girl in Presence of a virtuous Woman as Mrs  Jervis  always was noted to be As to the other vile Creature  Jewkes  'tis less Wonder altho' in  that  thou hadst the Impudence of  him  who set thee to Work But to make thy Attempt before Mrs  Jervis  and in spite of her Struggles and Reproaches was the very Stretch of shameless Wickedness  The dear Gentleman seemed a little disconcerted and said Surely surely Lady  Davers  this is going too far Look at  Pamela  's blushing Face and downcast Eye and wonder at yourself for this Question as much as you do at me for the Actions you speak of  The Countess said to me My dear Mrs  B  I wonder not at this sweet Confusion on so affecting a Question but indeed since it has come in so naturally I must say Mr  B  that we have all and my Daughters too wonder'd at this more than any Part of your Attempts because Sir we thought you one of the most civiliz'd Gentlemen in  England  and that you could not but wish to have saved Appearances a little  Tho' this said Mr  B  is to  you  my  Pamela  the Renewal of Griefs yet hold up your dear Face You maythe Triumph was yoursthe Shame and the Blushes ought to be mineAnd I will humour my saucy Sister in all she would have me say  Nay said Lady  Davers  you know the Question I cannot put it stronger  That's very true reply'd he But what would you have me say Do you expect I should give you a  Reason  for an Attempt that appears to you so very shocking  Nay Sir said the Countess don't say  Appears to Lady  Davers for excuse me it will appear so to every one who hears of it  I think my Brother is too hardly used said Lord  Davers  He has made all the Amends he could make and  you  my Sister who were the Person offended forgive him now I hope don't you  I could not answer for I was quite confounded and made a Motion to withdraw But Mr  B  said Don't go my Dear Tho' I ought to be asham'd of an Action set before me in so full a Glare in Presence of Lord  Davers  and the Countessyet I will not have you stir because I forget how you represented it and you must tell me  Indeed Sir I cannot said I Pray my dear Ladies pray my good Lord and dear Sir don't thus  renew my Griefs  as you were pleased justly to phrase it  I have the Representation of that Scene in my Pocket said my Lady for I was resolved as I told Lady  Betty  to shame the wicked Wretch with it the first Opportunity I had and I'll read it to you or rather you shall read it yourself Boldface if you can  So she pulled those Leaves out of her Pocket wrapp'd up carefully in a PaperHere I believe he who could act thus must read it and to spare  Pamela  's Confusion read it to yourself for we all know how it was  I think said he taking the Papers I can say something that will abate the Heinousness of this heavy  Charge or else I should not stand thus at the insolent Bar of my Sister answering her Interrogatories  I send you my dear Miss a Transcript of the Charge as follows To be sure you'll say he was a very wicked Gentleman  See  Vol I  p    seq  Mr  B  read this to himself and said This is a dark Affair as it is here stated and I can't say but  Pamela  and Mrs  Jervis  too had a great deal of Reason to apprehend the worst But surely Readers of it who were less Parties in the supposed Attempt and who were not determined at all Events to condemn me might have made a more favourable Construction for me than you Lady  Davers  have done in the strong Light in which you have set this heinous Matter before us  However since my Lady Countess and Lord  Davers  seem to expect that I shall particularly answer to this black Charge I will at a proper Time if it will be agreeable give you a brief History of my Passion for this dear Girl how it commenc'd and increas'd and my own Struggles with it And this will introduce with some little Advantage to myself perhaps what I have to say as to this supposed Attempt and at the same time inable you the better to account for some Facts which you have read in my pretty Accuser's Papers  This pleased every one and they begg'd him to begin  then  But he said It was Time we should think of Dressing the Morning being far advanc'd and if no Company came in he would give them in the Afternoon the Particulars they desired to hear  The three Gentlemen rode out and returned just Time enough to dress before Dinner and my Lady and the Countess also took an Airing in the Chariot Just as they returned Compliments came from several of the neighbouring Ladies to our noble Guests  on their Arrival in these Parts and to as many as sent Lady  Davers  desir'd their Companies for Tomorrow in the Afternoon to drink Tea But Mr  B  having fallen in with some of the Gentlemen likewise he told me we should have most of our visiting Neighbours at Dinner and desired Mrs  Jervis  might prepare accordingly for them  After Dinner Mr  H  took a Ride out attended with Mr  Colbrand  of whom he is very fond ever since he frighten'd Lady  Davers  's Footmen at the Hall threatening  See  Vol II  p    to chine them if they offer'd to stop his Lady for he says he loves a Man of Courage very probably knowing his own Defects that way for my Lady nowandthen calls him a Chickenhearted Fellow And then Lord and Lady  Davers  and the Countess reviv'd the Subject of the Morning and Mr  B  was pleased to begin in the Manner I shall mention byandby For here I am obliged to break off  Now my dear Miss I will proceed  'I need not said the dear Gentleman observe to any body who knows what Love is or rather that violent Passion which we mad young Fellows are apt to miscal Love what mean Things it puts us upon how it unmans and levels with the Dust the proudest Spirit In the Sequel of my Story you will observe several Instances of this Truth  'I began very early to take Notice of this lovely Girl even when she was hardly Thirteen Years old for her Charms increased every Day not only in my Eye but in the Eyes of every one who beheld her My Mother as  you  Lady  Davers  know took the greatest Delight in her always calling her her  Pamela  her good Child And  her Waitingmaid and her Cabinet of Rarities were her Boasts and equally shewn to every Visitor For besides the Beauty of her Figure and the genteel Air of her Person the dear Girl had a surprising Memory a Solidity of Judgment above her Years and a Docility so unequal'd that she took all Parts of Learning which her Lady as fond of instructing her as she of improving by Instruction crouded upon her insomuch that she had Masters to teach her to dance to sing and to play on the Spinnet whom she every Day surpris'd by the Readiness wherewith she took every thing  'I remember once my Mother praising her Girl before me and my Aunt  B  who is since dead I could not but take Notice to her of her Fondness for her and said What do you design Madam to do  with  or do  for  this  Pamela  of yours The Accomplishments you give her will do her more Hurt than Good For they will set her so much above her Degree that what you intend as a Kindness may prove her Ruin  'My Aunt join'd with me and spoke in a still stronger Manner against giving her such an Education And added as I well remember Surely Sister you do wrong One would think if one knew not my Nephew's discreet Pride that you design her for something more than your own Waitingmaid  'Ah Sister said the old Lady there is no Fear of what you hint at His Family Pride and stately Temper will secure my Son He has too much of his Father in him And as for  Pamela  you know not the Girl She has always in her Thoughts and in her Mouth too her Father's mean Condition and I shall do nothing for  them  at least at present tho' they are honest Folks and deserve well because I will keep the Girl humble  'But what can I do with the little Baggage continued my Mother She conquers every thing so fast and has such a Thirst after Knowlege and the more she knows I verily think the humbler she is that I cannot help letting go as my Son when a little Boy used to do to his Kite as fast as she pulls and to what Height she'll soar I can't tell  'I intended proceeded the good Lady at first only to make her Mistress of some fine Needleworks to qualify her as she has a Delicacy in her Person that makes it a Pity she should ever be put to hard Work for a genteel Place But she masters that so fast that now as my Daughter is marry'd and gone from me I am desirous to qualify her to divert and entertain me in my thoughtful Hours And were  you  Sister to know what she is capable of and how diverting her innocent Prattle is to me and her natural Simplicity which I encourage her to preserve amidst all she learns you would not nor my Son neither wonder at the Pleasure I take in her Shall I call her in  'I don't want said I to have the Girl called in If you Madam are diverted with her that's enough To be sure  Pamela  is a better Companion for a Lady than a Monkey or a Harlequin But I fear you'll set her above herself and make her vain and pert and that at last in order to support her Pride she may fall into Temptations that may be fatal to herself and others too  'I'm glad to hear this from my  Son  said the good Lady But the Moment I see my Favour puffs her up I shall take other Measures  'Well thought I to myself I want only to conceal my Views from your penetrating Eye my good Mother and I shall one Day take as much Delight in your Girl and her Accomplishments as you now do So go on and improve  her as fast as you will I'll only nowandthen talk against her to blind you and doubt not that all you bestow upon her will qualify her the better for my Purpose Only thought I fly swiftly on two or three more tardy Years and I'll nip this Bud by the Time it begins to open and place it in my Bosom for a Year or two at least for so long if the Girl behaves worthy of her Education I doubt not she'll be new to me Excuse me Ladies excuse me Lord  Davers  If I am not ingenuous I had better be silent'  I will as little as possible my dear Miss interrupt this affecting Narration by mentioning my own alternate Blushes Confusions and Exclamations as the naughty Gentleman went on nor the Censures and many Outuponyou's of me attentive Ladies and Fie Brothers of Lord  Davers  nor yet with Apologies for the Praises on myself so frequently intermingled contenting myself to give you as near as I can recollect the very Sentences of the dear Relator And as to our intermingled Exclaimings and Observations you may suppose what they were occasionally  'So continued Mr  B  I went on dropping Hints against her nowandthen and whenever I met her in the Passages about the House or in the Garden avoiding to look at her or to speak to her as she pass'd me court'sying and putting on a thousand bewitching Airs of Obligingness and Reverence while I who thought that the best way to demolish the Influence of such an Education would be to avoid alarming her Fears on one hand or to familiarize myself to her on the other till I came to strike the Blow looked haughty and reserved and passed by her with a stiff Nod at most Or if I spoke How does your Lady this Morning  GirlI hope she rested well last Night Then cover'd with Blushes and court'sying at every Word as if she thought herself unworthy of answering my Questions she'd trip away in a kind of Hurry and Confusion as soon as she had spoken And once I heard her say to Mrs  Jervis  Dear Sirs my young Master spoke to me and called me by my Name saying How slept your Lady last Night  Pamela  Was not that very good Mrs  Jervis  was it not Ay thought I I'm in the right way I find This will do in proper Time Go on my dear Mother improving as fast as you will I'll engage to pull down in Three Hours what you'll be building up in as many Years in spite of all the Lessons you can teach her  'Tis enough for me that I am establishing with you Ladies and with you my Lord a higher Reputation for my  Pamela  I am but too sensible I can make none for myself in the Relation I am now giving you Every one but my Mother who however had no high Opinion of her Son's Virtue used to look upon me as a Rake and I got the Name not very much to my Credit you'll say as well Abroad as in  England  of  the sober Rake  some would say  the genteel Rake  nay for that Matter some pretty Hearts that have smarted for their good Opinion have called me  the handsome Rake  But whatever other Epithet I was distinguished by it all concluded in  Rake  or  Libertine  nor was I very much offended at the Character for thought I if a Lady knows this and will come into my Company half the Ceremony between us is over and if she  calls  me so I shall have an excellent Excuse to punish her Freedom by greater of my own  'So I dress'd grew more and more confident and became as insolent withal as if tho' I had not  Lady  Davers  's Wit and Virtue I had all her Spirit excuse me Lady  Davers  and having a pretty bold Heart which rather put me upon courting than avoiding a Danger or Difficulty I had but too much my Way with every body and many a menac'd Complaint have I  look'd down  with a haughty Air and a Promptitude like that of  Colbrand  's to your Footmen at the Hall to clap my Hand to my Side Which was of the greater Service to my bold Enterprizes as two or three Gentlemen had found I knew how to be in Earnest  'Ha said my Lady thou wast ever an impudent Fellow and many a vile Roguery have I kept from my poor Mother Yet to my Knowlege she thought you no Saint  'Ay poor Lady continued he she used nowandthen to catechise me and was  sure  I was not so good as I ought to be For Son she would cry these late Hours these allnight Works and to come home so sober cannot be right I am not sure if I were to know all and yet I'm afraid of inquiring after your Ways whether I should not have Reason to wish you were brought home in Wine rather than to come home so sober and so late as you do  'Once I remember in the Summertime I came home about Six in the Morning and met the good Lady unexpectedly by the Garden BackDoor of which I had a Key to let myself in at all Hours I started and would have avoided her as soon as I saw her But she called me to her and then I approached her with an Air What brings you Madam into the Garden at so early an Hour said I turning my Face from her for I had a few Scratches on my Forehead with a Thorn or so that I feared she would be more inquisitive about than I cared for  'And what makes you said she so early here  Billy  What a rakish Figure dost thou make One time or other these Courses will yield you but little Comfort on Reflection Would to God thou wast but happily marry'd  'So Madam said I the old Wish I'm not so bad as you think me I hope I have not merited so great a Punishment  'These Hints I give not as Matter of Glory but Shame Yet I ought to tell you all the Truth or nothing Mean time thought I for I used as I mentioned in the Morning to have some Compunction for my vile Practices when cool Reflection brought on by Satiety had taken hold of me I wish this sweet Girl were grown to Years of Susceptibility that I might reform this wicked Course of Life and not prowl about disturbing honest Folks Peace and indangering myself And as I had by a certain very daring and wicked Attempt in which however I did not succeed set a Hornet's Nest about my Ears which I began to apprehend would sting me to Death having once escap'd an Ambush by dint of mere good Luck I thought it was better to remove the Seat of my Warfare into another Kingdom and to be a little more discreet for the future in my Amours So I went to  France  a second time as you know Sister and passed a Twelvemonth there in the best of Company and with some Improvement both to my Morals and Understanding and had very few Sallies considering my Love of Intrigue and the ample Means I had to prosecute successfully all the Desires of my Heart  'When I return'd several Matches were propos'd to me and my good Mother often requested me to make her so happy as she call'd it as to see me marry'd before she dy'd But I could not indure  the Thoughts of that State for I never saw a Lady whose Temper and Education I liked or with whom I thought I could live tolerably  See for his particular Reasons against marrying  Vol II  p    c  She used in vain therefore to plead Family Reasons to me Like most young Fellows I was too much a Selflover to pay so great a Regard to Posterity and to say Truth had very little Solicitude at that time whether my Name were continued or not in my own Descendants However upon my Return I look'd upon my Mother's  Pamela  with no small Pleasure and I found her so much improv'd as well in Person as Behaviour that I had the less Inducement either to renew my intriguing Life or to think of a marry'd State  'Yet as my Mother had all her Eyes about her as the Phrase is I affected great Shyness both before her and to the Girl for I doubted not my very Looks would be watched by them both and what the one discover'd would not be a Secret to the other and laying myself open to too early a Suspicion I thought would but ice the Girl over and make my Mother more watchful  'So I used to come into my Mother's Apartments and go out without taking the least Notice of her but putting on stiff Airs and as she always withdrew when I came in I never made any Pretence to keep her there  'Once indeed my Mother said on my looking after her when her Back was turn'd My dear Son I don't like your Eye following my Girl so intently Only I know that sparkling Lustre natural to it or I should have some Fear for my  Pamela  as she grows older  '  I  look after her said I  My  Eyes sparkle at such a Girl as that No indeedShe may be your  Favourite as a Waitingmaid but I see nothing but clumsy Court'sies and aukward Airs about her A little Rustick Affectation of Innocence that to such as cannot see into her may pass well enough  'Nay my Dear reply'd my Mother don't say that of all things She has no Affectation I am sure  'Yes she has in my Eye Madam and I'll tell you how it comes about You have taught her to assume the Airs of a Gentlewoman to dance and to enter a Room with a Grace and yet bid her keep her low Birth and Family in View And between the one Character which she wants to get into and the other she dares not get out of she trips up and down mincingly and knows not how to set her Feet So 'tis the same in every Gesture her Arms she knows not whether to swim with or hold before her nor whether to hold her Head up or down and so does neither but hangs it on one Side a little aukward Piece of Oneandt'other I think herAnd indeed Madam you'd do the Girl more Kindness to put her into your Dairy than to keep her about your Person for she'll be utterly spoil'd I doubt for any useful Purpose  'Ah Son said she I fear by your Description you have minded her too much in one Sense tho' not enough in another 'Tis not my Intention to recommend her to your Notice of all Men And I doubt not if it please God I live and she continues to be a good Girl but she will make a Man of some middling genteel Business very happy  '  Pamela  came in just then with an Air so natural and yet so humble and so much above herself that I was forc'd to turn my Head from her lest my Mother should watch my Eye again and lest I  should be inclin'd to do her that Justice which my Heart assented to but which my Lips had just before deny'd her  'All my Difficulty in Apprehension was my good Mother The Effect of whose Lessons to her Girl I was not however so much afraid of as her Vigilance For thought I I see by the Delicacy of her Person the Brilliancy of her Eye and the sweet Apprehensiveness that plays about every Feature of her Face that she must have Tinder enough in her Constitution to catch a wellstruck Spark and I'll warrant I shall know how to set her in a Blaze in a few Months more  'Yet I wanted as I pass'd to catch her Attention too I expected her to turn after me and look so as to shew a beginning Liking towards me for you must know I had a great Opinion of my Person and Air which had been fortunately distinguish'd by Ladies whom of course my Vanity made me allow to be very good Judges of these outward Advantages  'I'll give your Ladyship an Instance of this my Vanity in a Catch I made  extempore  to a Lady whom I had been urging to give me some Proofs of a Love that I had the Confidence to tell her I was sure she had in her Heart for me She was a lively Lady and laughing said Whoever admir'd me it must be for my Confidence and nothing else But urging her farther Why said she brazen Man for she'd call Names like Lady  Davers  what would you have me say I would love you if I  could  ButHere interrupting her and putting on a free Air I half said and half sung  'You'd love me you say if you  cou'd    'Why thou mak'st me a very odd Creature  'I pr'ythee survey me again  'What can'st thou object to my  Feature  'This shew'd my Vanity And I answer'd for the Lady  'Why nothing  Very wellThen I'm sure you'll admit  'That the  Choice  I have made is a Sign of my  WIT  'But to my great Disappointment  Pamela  never by any favourable Glance gave the least Incouragement to my Vanity Well thought I this Girl has certainly nothing ethereal in her Mould All unanimated Clay But the Dancing and Singing Airs my Mother is teaching her will make her better qualify'd in time and another Year Will ripen her into my Arms no doubt of it Let me only go on in my present way and make her  fear  me That will inhance in her Mind every Favour I shall afterwards vouchsafe to shew her and never question old  humdrum  Virtue thought I but the Tempter  without  and the Tempter  within  will be too many for the perversest Nicety that ever the Sex boasted  'Yet tho' I could not once attract her Eye towards me she never fail'd to draw mine after her whenever she went by me or whereever I saw her except as I said in my Mother's Presence and particularly when she had passed me and could not see me look at her without turning her Head as I expected so often from her in vain  'You will wonder Lord  Davers  who I suppose was once in Love or you'd never have marry'd such an hostile Spirit as my Sister's there'  Go on Saucebox said she I won't interrupt you  'You will wonder how I could behave so coolly as to escape all Discovery so long from a Lady so watchful as my Mother and from the Apprehensiveness of the Girl for high or low every  Individual of the Sex is quick as Lightning to Imaginations of this Kind And besides well says the Poet  Men without Love have oft so cunning grown  That something  like  it they have shown  But none who had it e'er seem'd to have  none    Love's of a strangely open simple Kind  Can no Arts or Disguises find  But thinks none sees it 'cause itself is blind  'But to say nothing of her tender Years and that my Love was not of this bashful Sort I was not absolutely determin'd so great was my Pride that I ought to think her worthy of being my  Mistress  when I had not much Reason as I thought to despair of prevailing upon Persons of higher Birth were I disposed to try to live with me upon my own Terms My Pride therefore kept my Passion at Bay as I may say So far was I from imagining I should ever be brought to what has since happen'd But to proceed  'Hitherto my Mind was taken up with the Beauties of her Person only My EYE had drawn my HEART after it without giving myself any Trouble about that Sense and Judgment which my Mother was always praising in her  Pamela  as exceeding her Years and Opportunities But an Occasion happen'd slight in itself but which took the HEAD into the Party and made me think of her young as she was with a Distinction that before I had not had for her The Occasion was this  'Being with my Mother in her Closet who was talking to me on the old Subject  Matrimony  I saw  Pamela  's Commonplace Book as I may call it In which by her Lady's Direction from time to time she had transcribed from the Bible and other good Books such Passages as made most Impression  upon her as she read A Method I take it my Dear  turning to me  that was of great Service to you as it initiated you into Writing with that Freedom and Ease which shine in your saucy Letters and Journals and to which my present Fetters are not a little owing Just as Pedlars catch Monkeys in the Baboon Kingdoms provoking the attentive Fools by their own Example to put on Shoes and Stockens till the Apes of Imitation trying to do the like intangle their Feet and so cannot escape upon the Boughs of the Tree of Liberty on which before they were wont to hop and skip about and play a thousand puggish Tricks  'I observ'd the Girl wrote a pretty Hand and very swift and free and affixed her Points or Stops with so much Judgment her Years consider'd that I began to have an high Opinion of her Understanding Some Observations likewise upon several of the Passages were so just and solid that I could not help being tacitly surprised at them  'My Mother watched my Eye and was silent I seemed not to observe that she did and after a while laid down the Book shutting it with great Indifference and talking of another Subject  'Upon this my Mother said Don't you think '  Pamela  writes a pretty Hand Mr  B  'I did not mind it much said I with a careless Air This is her Writing is it Taking the Book and opening it again at a Place of Scripture The Girl is mighty pious said I  'I wish you were so Child  'I wish so too Madam if it would please  you    'I wish so for your  own  sake Child  'So do I Madam and down I laid the Book 'again very carelesly  'Look once more in it said she and see if you 'can't open it upon some Place that may strike you  'I open'd it at  Train up a Child in the Way it should go  c I fansy said I when I was at  Pamela  's Age I was pretty near as good as she  'Never never said my Mother I am sure I took great Pains with you but alas to very little Purpose You had always a violent headstrong Will  'Some Allowances for Boys and Girls I hope Madam But you see I am as good for a Man as my Sister for a Woman  'No indeed you are not I do assure you  'I am sorry for that Madam You give me a sad 'Opinion of myself  'Brazen Wretch said my Lady But go on  'Turn to one of the Girl's Observations on some 'Text said my Mother  'I did and was pleased with it more than I would own The Girl's well enough said I for what she is but let's see what she'll be a few Years hence There will be the Trial  'She'll be always good I doubt not  'So much the better for herBut can't we talk of any other Subject than this foolish Girl You complain how seldom I attend you Madam and indeed when you are always talking of Matrimony or of this lowborn raw Girl it must needs lessen the Pleasure of approaching you  'But now as I hinted to you Ladies and my Lord I had a still higher Opinion of  Pamela  and esteem'd her more worthy of my Attempts For thought I the Girl has good Sense and it will be some Pleasure to watch by what Gradations she may be made to rise into Love and into a higher Life than that to which she was born And so I began to think she would be worthy in time of being my  Mistress  which till now as I said before I had been a little scrupulous about  'I took a little Tour soon after this in Company of a few Friends with whom I had contracted an Intimacy abroad into  Scotland  and  Ireland  they having a Curiosity to see those Countries and we spent Six or Eight Months on this Expedition and when I had landed them in  France  I returned home and found my good Mother in a very indifferent State of Health but her  Pamela  arrived to a Height of Beauty and Perfection that exceeded all my Expectations I was so much taken with her Charms the first time I saw her after my Return which was in the Garden with a Book in her Hand just come out of a little Summerhouse that I then thought of obliging her to go back again in order to begin a Parley with her But while I was resolving she tript away with her Court'sies and Reverences and was out of my Sight before I could determine  'I was resolved however not to be long without her and Mrs  Jewkes  having been recommended to me a little before by a BrotherRake as a Woman of try'd Fidelity I ask'd her If she would be Faithful if I should have Occasion to commit a pretty Girl to her Care  'She hoped she said it would be with the Lady's own Consent and she should make no Scruple of obeying me  'So I thought I would waylay the Girl and carry her first to a little Village in  Northamptonshire  to an Acquaintance of Mrs  Jewkes  's And when I had brought her to be easy and pacify'd a little I design'd that  Jewkes  should attend her to  See  Vol I  p    l    Lincolnshire  For I knew there was no coming at her here under my Mother's Wing by her own Consent and that to offer Terms to  her would be to blow up my Project all at once Besides I was sensible that Mrs  Jervis  would stand in the way of my Proceedings as well as my Mother  'The Method I had contriv'd was quite easy as I imagin'd and such as could not have failed to answer my Purpose as to carrying her off and I doubted not of making her well satisfy'd in her good Fortune very quickly for having a Notion of her affectionate Duty to her Parents I was not displeased that I could make the Terms very easy and happy to them all  'What most stood in my way was my Mother's Fondness for her But on the Supposition that I had got her Favourite into my Hands which appeared to me as I said a Task very easy to be conquered I had actually form'd a Letter for her to transcribe acknowleging a LoveAffair and laying her Withdrawing herself so privately to the implicit Obedience she ow'd to her Husband's Commands to whom she was marry'd that Morning and who being a young Gentleman of a genteel Family and dependent on his Friends was desirous of keeping it all a profound Secret and begging on that Account her Lady not to divulge it so much as to Mrs  Jervis    'And to prepare for this and make her Escape the more probable when Matters were ripe for my Plot I came in one Night and examined all the Servants and Mrs  Jervis  the latter in my Mother's Hearing about a genteel young Man whom I pretended to find with a Pillion on the Horse he rode upon waiting about the Back Door of the Garden for some body to come to him and who rode off when I came up to the Door as fast as he could  'Nobody knew any thing of the Matter and were much surprised at what I told them But I begg'd  Pamela  might be watched and that no one would say any thing to her about it  'My Mother said She had two Reasons not to speak of it to  Pamela  one to oblige me the other and chief because it would break the poor innocent Girl's Heart to be suspected Poor dear Child said she where can she go to be so happy as with me Would it not be inevitable Ruin to her to leave me There is nobody comes after her She receives no Letters but nowandthen one from her Father and Mother and them she shews me  'Well reply'd I I hope she can have no Design 'twould be strange if she had formed any to leave so good a Mistress But you can't be  sure  all the Letters she receives are from her Father and her shewing to you Madam those he writes looks like a Cloak to others she may receive from another Hand But it can be no Harm said I to have an Eye upon her You don't know Madam what Tricks there are in the World  'Not I indeed but only this I know that the Girl shall be under no Restraint if she is resolv'd to leave me well as I love her  'Mrs  Jervis  said She would have an Eye upon  Pamela  in Obedience to my Command but she was sure there was no need nor would she so much wound the poor Child's Peace as to mention the Matter to her  'This I suffered to blow off and seem'd to my Mother to have so good an Opinion of her  Pamela  that I was sorry as I told her I had had such a Surmise Saying that tho' the Fellow and the Pillion were an odd Circumstance yet I dared to say there could be nothing in it for I doubted not  the Girl's Duty and Gratitude would hinder her from doing a foolish or rash thing  'This my Mother heard with Pleasure altho' my Motive for it was but to lay her  Pamela  on the thicker to her when she was to be told she had escaped  'She said She was glad I was not an Enemy to the poor Child  Pamela  has no Friend but me continued the good Lady and if I don't provide for her I shall have done her more Harm than Good as you and your Aunt  B  have often said in the Accomplishments I have given her And yet the poor Girl I see that added she would not be afraid to turn her Hand to any thing for the sake of an honest Livelihood were she put to it which if it please God to spare me and she continues good she never shall be  'I wonder not  Pamela  at your Tears on this Occasion Your Lady was an excellent Woman and deserv'd this Tribute to her Memory All my Pleasure now is that she knew not half my wicked Pranks and that I did not vex her worthy Heart in the Prosecution of this Scheme which would have given me a severe Sting inasmuch as I might have apprehended with too much Reason that I had shortened her Days by the Knowlege of the one and the other  'I had thus in Readiness every thing necessary for the Execution of my Project But my Mother's ill State of Health gave me too much Concern to permit me to proceed And nowandthen as my frequent Attendance on her in her Illness gave me an Opportunity of observing more and more of the Girl and her affectionate Duty and continual Tears finding her frequently on her Knees praying for her Mistress I was moved to pity her And often did I while those Scenes of my Mother's  Illness and Decline were before me resolve to conquer if possible my guilty Passion as those Scenes taught me while their Impressions held upon me justly to call it and I was much concerned I found it a more difficult Task than I imagin'd For till now I thought it principally owing to my usual enterprising Temper and a Love of Intrigue and that I had nothing to do but to resolve against it and to subdue it  'But I found I was greatly mistaken for I had insensibly brought myself to admire her in every thing she said or did and there was so much Gracefulness Humility and Innocence in her whole Behaviour and I saw so many melting Scenes between her Lady and her that I found I could not master my Esteem for her  'My Mother's Illness increasing beyond Hopes of Recovery and having settled all her greater Affairs she talked to me of her Servants I asked her What she would have done for  Pamela  and Mrs  Jervis  'Make Mrs  Jervis  my dear Son said she as happy as you can She is a Gentlewoman born you know let her always be treated as such But for your own sake don't make her independent for then you'll want a faithful Manager Yet if you marry and your Lady should not value her as she deserves allow her a Competency for the rest of her Life and let her live as she pleases  'As for my  Pamela  I hope you will be her Protector I hope you will She is a good Girl I love her next to you and your dear Sister She is just arrived at a trying Time of Life I don't know what to say for her What I had design'd was that if any Man of a genteel Calling should offer I would have given her a little pretty Portion had God spared my Life till then But if she  should be made independent some idle Fellow perhaps might snap her up for she is very pretty Or if she should carry what you give her to her poor Parents as her Duty would lead her to do they are so unhappily involv'd that a little Matter would be nothing to them and the poor Girl might be to seek again Perhaps Lady  Davers  will take her But I wish she was not so pretty She will be likely to be the Bird for which some wicked Fowler will spread his Snares or it may be every Lady will not chuse to have such a Waitingmaid You are a young Gentleman and I am sorry to say it not better than I wish you to be Tho' I hope my  Pamela  would not be in Danger from her Master who owes to all his Servants Protection as much as a King does to his Subjects Yet I don't know how to wish her to stay with you for your own Reputation's sake my dear Son for the World will censure as it lists Would to God said she the dear Girl had the Small Pox in a mortifying manner She'd be lovely enough in the Genteelness of her Person and the Beauty of her Mind and more out of Danger of suffering from the transient Beauties of Countenance Yet I think added she she might be safe and happy under Mrs  Jervis  's Care and if you marry and your Lady parts with Mrs  Jervis  let 'em go together and live as they like I think that will be the best for both And you have a generous Spirit enough I will not direct you in the  Quantum  But my dear Son remember that I am the less concerned that I have not done for the poor Girl myself because I depend upon you The Manner how fitly to provide for her has made me defer it till now that I have so much more important Concerns on my Hands Life and Strength ebbing so fast that I am hardly  fit for any thing or to wish for any thing but to receive the last releasing Stroke'  Here the dear Gentleman stopp'd being under some Concern himself and we in much more At last he resum'd the Subject  You will too naturally think my Lord and you my good Ladies that the Mind must be truly diabolical that could break thro' the Regards due to the solemn Injunctions and Recommendations of a dying Parent They did hold me a good while indeed and as fast as I had any Emotions of a contrary Nature rise in my Breast I endeavoured for some time to suppress them and to think and act as I ought But the dear bewitching Girl every Day rose in her Charms upon me And finding she still continued the Use of her Pen and Ink I could not help entertaining a Jealousy that she was writing to somebody who stood well in her Opinion and my Love for her and my own Spirit of Intrigue made it a Sweetheart of course And I could not help watching her Motions and seeing her once putting a Letter she had just folded up into her Bosom at my Entrance into my Mother's Dressingroom I made no doubt of detecting her and her Correspondent and so I took the Letter from her  See  Vol I  p    Stays she trembling and court'sying with a sweet Confusion and highly pleased I was to find it contained nothing but Innocence and Duty to the deceased Mistress and the loving Parents expressing her Joy that in the midst of her Grief for losing the one she was not obliged to return to be a Burden to the other And I gave it her again with Words of Incouragement and went down much better satisfied than I had been with her Correspondents  'But when I reflected on the innocent Simplicity of her Style I was still more in Love with her and form'd a Stratagem and succeeded in it to come at her other Letters  See  Vol I  p    which I sent forward after I had read them all but three or four which I kept back when my Plot began to ripen for Execution altho' the little Slut was most abominably free upon my Character to her Father and Mother  'You will censure me no doubt that my Mother's Injunctions made not a more lasting Impression upon me But really I struggled hard with myself to give them their due Force and the dear Girl as I said every Day grew lovelier and more accomplish'd Her Letters were but so many Links to the Chains she had bound me in and tho' once I had resolv'd to part with her  See  Vol I  p    to Lady  Davers  and you my Lady had an Intention to take her I could not for my Life give her up and thinking at that time more honourably of the State of a Mistress than I have done since I could not persuade myself since I intended to do as handsomely by her as ever Man did to a Lady in that Circumstance but that I should do better for her than my Mother had wished me to do and so  more  than answer all her Injunctions as to the providing for her And I could not imagine I should have met with a Resistance from her that I had seldom encountered from Persons much her Superiors as to Descent and was amaz'd at it for it confounded me in all the Notions I had of her Sex which like a true Libertine I supposed wanted nothing but  Importunity  and  Opportunity  a bold Attempter and a Mind not ungenerous  'Sometimes I admired her for her Virtue at other times impetuous in my Temper and unus'd to Controul I could have beat her She well I remember describes the Tumults of my Soul when she repeats what once passed between us in Words like these  "  See  Vol I  p    Take the little Witch from me Mrs  Jervis  I can neither bear nor forbear her But stay you shan't goYet begone No come back again"  'She thought I was mad I remember she says in her Papers Indeed I was little less  'She says  "I took her Arm and grip'd it black and blue to bring her back again and then sat down and look'd at her as silly as such a poor Girl as she"  'Well did the dear Slut describe the Passion I struggled with and no one can conceive how much my Pride made me despise myself at times for the little Actions my Love for her put me upon and yet to find that Love increasing every Day as her Charms and her Resistance increased  'I have caught myself in a raging Fit sometimes vowing I would have her and at others jealous that to secure herself from my Attempts she would throw herself into the Arms of some Menial or Inferior that otherwise she would not have thought of  'Sometimes I soothed her sometimes threatened her but never was such Courage when she apprehended her Virtue was in Danger mix'd with so much Humility when her Fears gave way to her Hopes of a juster Treatment  'Then I would think it impossible so slight an Opinion had I of Woman's Virtue that such a Girl as this Cottageborn who owed every thing  to my Family and had an absolute Dependence on my Pleasure myself not despicable in Person or Mind as I supposed she unprejudic'd in any Man's Favour at an Age susceptible of Impressions and a Frame and Constitution not Ice nor Snow Surely thought I all this Frost must be owing to the Want of Fire in my Attempts to thaw it I used to dare more and succeed better Shall such a Girl as  this  awe me by her rigid Virtue No she shall not  'Then I would resolve to be more in Earnest Yet my Love was a Traitor to me That was more faithful to  her  than to  me  it had more Honour in it at Bottom than I had designed it should have Aw'd by her unaffected Innocence and a Virtue I had never before encounter'd so uniform and immoveable the Moment I  saw  her I was half disarmed and I courted her Consent to that which tho' I was not likely to obtain yet it went against me to think of extorting by Violence Yet Marriage was never in my Thoughts I scorn'd so much as to promise it  'What numberless mean Things did not this unmanly Passion subject me to I used to watch for her Letters tho' mere Prittleprattle and Chitchat receiv'd them with burning Impatience and read them with Delight tho' myself was accused in them and stigmatiz'd as I deserv'd  'I would listen meanly at her Chamberdoor try to overhear her little Conversations in vain attempted to suborn Mrs  Jervis  to my Purposes inconsistently talking of Honour when no one Step I took or Action I attempted shewed any thing like it lost my Dignity among my Servants made a Party in her Favour against me of every body but whom my Money corrupted and that hardly sufficient to keep my Partisans steady to my  Interest so greatly did the Virtue of the Servants triumph over the Vice of the Master when attracted by such an Example  'I have been very tedious Ladies and my Lord  Davers  in my Narration But I am come within View of the Point for which I now am upon my Trial at your dread Tribunal  bowing to us all    'After several Endeavours of a smooth and a rough Nature in which my Devil constantly fail'd me and her good Angel prevail'd I had talk'd to Mrs  Jervis  to induce the Girl to whom in hopes of frightening her I had given Warning but which she rejoiced to take to my great Disappointment to desire to stay  See  Vol I  p    and suspecting Mrs  Jervis  play'd me Booty and rather confirm'd her in her Coyness and her Desire of leaving me I was mean enough to conceal myself in the Closet in Mrs  Jervis  's Room in order to hear their private Conversation But really not designing to make any other Use of my Concealment than to teize her a little if she should say any thing I did not like which would give me a Pretence to treat her with greater Freedoms than I had ever yet done and would be an Introduction to take off from her unprecedented Apprehensiveness another Time And I had the less Scruple as to Mrs  Jervis  's Presence because she knew as bad of me as she could know from  Pamela  's Apprehensions as well as her own and would find me if I kept within any decent Bounds better than either of them expected But I had no Design of proceeding to Extremities altho' I had little Hope of impressing her by Gentleness  'So like a benighted Traveller who had strayed out of his Knowlege and despairing to find  his Way threw the Reins upon his Horse's Neck to be guided at its uncertain Direction I resolv'd to take my Chance for the Issue which the Adventure should produce  'But the dear Prattler not knowing I was there as she undress'd herself began such a bewitching Chitchat with Mrs  Jervis  who I found but ill kept my Secret that I never was at such a Loss in my Life what to resolve upon One while I wish'd myself unknown to them out of the Closet into which my inconsiderate Passion had meanly led me another time I was incens'd at the Freedom with which I heard myself treated But then rightly considering that I had no Business to hearken to their private Conversation and that it was such as became  them  while I ought to have been asham'd to give Occasion for it I excus'd them both and admir'd still more and more the dear Prattler  'In this Suspense the undesigned Rustling of my Nightgown from changing my Posture as I stood giving Alarm to the watchful  Pamela  she in a Fright came towards the Closet to see who was there so that I could be no longer conceal'd  'What could I then do but bolt out upon the apprehensive Charmer and having so done and she running to the Bed screaming to Mrs  Jervis  would not any Man have follow'd her thither detected as I was But yet I said If she forbore her Screaming I would do her no Harm but if not she should take the Consequence  'I found by their Exclamations that this would pass with both for an Attempt of the worst Kind but really I had no such Intentions as they feared When indeed I found myself detected when the dear frighten'd Girl ran to the Bed when Mrs  Jervis  threw herself about her when  they would not cease their hideous Squallings when I was charg'd by Mrs  Jervis  with the worst Designs it was enough to make me go farther than I designed and could I have prevailed upon Mrs  Jervis  to go up and quiet the Maids who were rising as I heard by the Noise they made overhead upon the others Screamings I believe had  Pamela  kept out of her Fit I should have been a little freer with her than ever I had been But as it was I had no Thought but of making as honourable a Retreat as I could and to save myself from being expos'd to my whole Family and I was not guilty of any Freedoms that her Modesty unaffrighted could reproach itself with having suffered and the dear Creature's fainting Fits gave  me  almost as great Apprehensions as I could give  her    'Thus Ladies and my Lord have I tediously and little enough to my own Reputation given you a Character of myself and told you more against myself than any  one  Person could accuse me of Whatever redounds to the Credit of my  Pamela  redounds in Part to my own and so I have the less Regret to accuse myself since it exalts her But as to a form'd intention to hide myself in the Closet in order to attempt the Girl by Violence and in the Presence of a good Woman as Mrs  Jervis  is which you impute to me indeed bad as I was I was not so vile so abandon'd as that  'Love as I said before subjects its inconsiderate Votaries to innumerable Meannesses and unlawful Passion to many more I could not live without this dear Girl I hated the Thoughts of Matrimony with any body and to be brought to the Stake by my Mother's Waitingmaid forbid it Pride thought I forbid it Example forbid it all my past Sneers and constant Ridicule both on the Estate and on those who descended to Inequalities  in it and lastly forbid it my Family Spirit so visible in Lady  Davers  as well as myself to whose Insults and those of all the World I shall be obnoxious if I make such a Step  'All this tends to demonstrate the Strength of my Passion I could not conquer my Love so I conquer'd a Pride which every one thought unconquerable and since I could not make an innocent Heart vicious I had the Happiness to follow so good an Example and I thank God a vicious Heart is become virtuous as I hope at least morally so and I have the Pleasure of rejoicing in the Change and hope I shall still more and more rejoice in it for I really look back with Contempt upon my past Follies and it is now a greater Wonder to me how I could act as I did than that I should detest those Actions which made me a Curse instead of a Benefit to Society Indeed I am not yet so pious as my  Pamela  but that is to come and it is one good Sign that I can truly say I delight in every Instance of her Piety and Virtue And now I will conclude my tedious Narration with the Poet  Our Passions gone and Reason in her Throne  Amaz'd we see the Mischiefs we have done  After a  Tempest  when the Winds are laid  The calm Sea wonders at the Wrecks it made  '  Thus ended my dear Mr  B  his affecting Relation which in the Course of it gave me a thousand different Emotions and made me often pray for him as I constantly do that God will intirely convert a Heart so generous and worthy as his is on most Occasions And if I can but find him not deviate when we go to  London  I shall have great Hopes that nothing will affect his Morals again  I have just read over again the foregoing Account of himself As near as I remember and my Memory is the best Faculty I have it is pretty exact only he was fuller of beautiful Similitudes and spoke in a more flowery Style as I may say Yet don't you think Miss if I have not done Injustice to his Spirit that the Beginning of it especially is in the saucy Air of a Man too much alive to such Notions For so the Ladies observed in his NarrationIs it very like the Style of a true PenitentBut indeed he went on better and concluded best of all  But don't you observe what a dear good Lady I had Blessings a thousand Blessings on her beloved Memory Were I to live to see my Childrens Children they should be all taught to lisp her Praises before they could speak  My  Gratitude should always be renew'd in  their  Mouths and GOD and my dear Father and Mother my Lady and my Master that was my best Friend that is but principally as most due the FIRST who inspired all the rest should have their Morning their Noontide and their Evening Praises as long as I lived  I will only observe further as to this my Third Conversation piece That my Lord  Davers  offer'd to extenuate some Parts of his dear Brotherinlaw's Conduct which he did not himself vindicate and Mr  B  was pleased to observe that my Lord was always very candid to him and kind in his Allowances for the Sallies of an ungovernable Youth Upon which my Lady said a little tartly Yes and for a very good Reason I doubt not For who cares to condemn himself  Nay said my Lord pleasantly don't put us upon a Foot neither For what Sallies I made before I knew your Ladyship were but like those of a Fox who nowandthen runs away with a straggling Pullet when nobody sees him Whereas those of my Brother  were like the Invasions of a Lion breaking into every Man's Fold and driving the Shepherds as well as the Sheep before himAy said my Lady but I can look around me and have Reason perhaps to think the invading Lion has come off little as he deserv'd it better than the creeping Fox who with all his Cunning sometimes suffers for his pilfering Theft  O Miss these Gentlemen are strange Creatures What can they think of themselves for they say there is not one virtuous Man in fiveBut I hope for our Sex's sake as well as for the World's sake all is not true that evil Fame reports for you know every Mantrespasser must find or make a WomantrespasserAnd if so what a World is this And how must the Innocent suffer from the Guilty Yet how much better is it to suffer one's self than to be the Cause of another's Suffering  I long to hear of you And must shorten my future Accounts or I shall do nothing but write and tire  you  into the Bargain tho' I cannot my dear Father and Mother I am my dear Miss  Always Yours  P B  LETTER XXXI From Miss  DARNFORD  to Mr  B  My dear Mrs  B  EVERY Post you more and more oblige us to admire and love you And let me tell you I will gladly receive your Letters upon your own Terms  See p    Only when your worthy Parents have perused them see that I have every Line of them again  Your Account of the Arrival of your noble Guests and their Behaviour to you and yours to them your Conversation and wise Determination on the offer'd Title of Baronet the just Applauses conferred on you by all particularly the good Countess your Breakfast Conversation and the Narrative of your saucy abominable  Master  tho' amiable  Husband  all delight us beyond Expression  Do go on dear excellent Lady with your charming Journals and let us know all that passes  As to the State of Matters with us I have desired my Papa to allow me to decline Mr  Murray  's Addresses The good Man lov'd me most violently nay he could not live without me Life was no Life unless I favour'd him But yet after a few more of these Flights he is trying to sit down satisfy'd without my Papa's foolish perverse Girl as Sir  Simon  calls me and to transpose his Affections to a worthier Object my Sister  Nancy  and it would make you smile to see how a little while before he  directly  apply'd to her she screw'd up her Mouth to my Mamma and Truly she'd have none of  Polly  's Leavings no not sheBut no sooner did he declare himself in Form than the  gaudy Wretch  as he was before with her became a  welldress'd  Gentleman the  chattering Magpye  for he talks and laughs much  quite conversible  and has something  agreeable  to say on  every Subject  Once He would make a good Master of the Buckhounds but now Really the  more  one is in his Company the  more polite  one finds him  Then on his Part Indeed he happened to see Miss  Polly  first and Truly he could have thought himself very happy in so agreeable a young Lady Yet there was always something of Majesty what a stately Name is that for IllNature in Miss  Nanny  something so aweful that while Miss  Polly  ingaged  the Affections at first Sight Miss  Nanny  struck a Man with Reverence insomuch that the one might be loved as a Woman but the other revered as something more A Goddess no doubt  I do but think that when he comes to be lifted up to her Celestial Sphere as her Fellow Constellation what a Figure will  Nancy  and her  Ursa Major  make together and how will they glitter and shine to the Wonder of all Beholders  Then she must make a brighter Appearance by far and a more pleasing one too for why She has  Satellites  or little Stars in her Train more than poor  Polly  can pretend to Won't there be fine Twinkling and Sparkling think you when the Greater and Lesser Bearstars are joined together  But excuse me dear Mrs  B  this saucy Girl has vex'd me just now by her illnatur'd Tricks and I am even with her having thus vented my Spite tho' she knows nothing of the Matter  So fansy my dear Friend you see  Polly Darnford  abandon'd by her own Fault her Papa angry at her her Mamma pitying her and calling her silly Girl Mr  Murray  who is a rough Lover growling over his Mistress as a Dog over a Bone he fears to lose Miss  Nancy  putting on her prudish Pleasantry and snarling out a kind Word and breaking thro' her sullen Gloom for a Smile nowandthen in Return and I laughing at both in my Sleeve and thinking that in a while I shall get Leave to attend you in Town and that will be better than twenty humble Servants of Mr  Murray  's Cast Or if I can't that I shall have the Pleasure of your Correspondence here and injoy unenvied the Favour of my dear Papa and Mamma which this ill temper'd Girl is always begrudging me  Forgive all this Nonsense I was willing to wri  e something tho' worse than nothing to shew how  desirous I would be to oblige you had I Capacity or Subject as you have But nobody can love you better or admire you more of this you may be assured however unequal in all other respects than  Your  POLLY DARNFORD  I send you up some of your Papers for the good Couple in  Kent  Pray my Respects to them and beg they'll let me have 'em again as soon as they can by your Conveyance  Our  Stamford  Friends desire their kindest Respects They mention you with Delight in every Letter  LETTER XXXII The  JOURNAL  continued  Thursday Friday  Evening  My dearest Miss  Darnford  I AM retired from a very busy Day having had no less than Fourteen of our Neighbours Gentlemen and Ladies to Dinner with us The Occasion principally to welcome our noble Guests into these Parts Mr  B  having as I mentioned in a former turn'd the intended Visit into an Entertainment after his usual generous Manner  Mr  B  and Lord  Davers  are gone Part of the Way with them home and Mr  H  or Lord  Jackey  as we call the Gentleman who will always be young mounted with his Favourite  Colbrand  as an Escorte to the Countess and Lady  Davers  who are gone to take an Airing in the Chariot They offer'd to take the Coach if I would have gone but being fatigu'd I desir'd to be excus'd So I retir'd to my  Closet and Miss  Darnford  who is seldom out of my Thoughts coming into my Mind I had a new Recruit of Spirits which inabled me to resume my Pen and thus I proceed with my Journal  Our Company was  For the Characters of most of these Gentlemen and Ladies see  Vol I  p    and  Vol II  p    to    and    to    the Earl and Countess of  D  who are so fashionable a marry'd Couple that the Earl made it his Boast and his Countess bore it like one accustomed to such Treatment that he had not been in his Lady's Company an Hour abroad before for seven Years You know his Lordship's Character Every body does and there is not a worse as Report says in the Peerage  Sir  Thomas Atkyns  a single Gentleman not a little finical and ceremonious and a mighty Beau tho' of the tawdry Sort and affecting foreign Airs as if he was afraid it would not be judg'd by any other Mark that he had travelled  Mr  Arthur  and his Lady a moderately happy Couple who seem always when together to behave as if they were upon a Compromise that is that each would take it in Turn to say free Things of the other tho' some of their Freedoms are of so cutting a Nature that it looks as if they intended to divert the Company at their own Expence The Lady being of a noble Family takes great Pains to let every one know that she values herself not a little upon that Advantage But otherwise has many good Qualities  Mr  Brooks  and his Lady a Gentleman who is a free Joker on serious Subjects but a goodnatur'd Man and says sprightly things with no ill Grace but his Lady is a little reserved and of a haughty Turn tho' Today she happened to be freer than usual as was observed at Table by  Lady  Towers  who is a Maiden Lady of Family noted for her Wit and Repartee and who says many good Things with so little Doubt and really so good a Grace that one cannot help being pleas'd with her This Lady is generally gallanted by  Mr  Martin  of the Grove as he is called to distinguish him from a rich Citizen of that Name who is settled in these Parts but being covetous and proud is seldom admitted among the Gentry in their Visits or Parties of Pleasure Mr  Martin  is a shrewd Gentleman but has been a little too much of the Libertine Cast and has lived freely as to Women and for that Reason has not been received by Mrs  Towers  who hates free Actions tho' she'll use free Words modestly free as she calls them that is to say the Double Entendre in which Sir  Simon Darnford  a Gentleman you are not unacquainted with takes great Delight tho' by the way what that worthy Gentleman calls innocent Lady  Towers  would blush at  Mr  Dormer  a Gentleman of a very courteous Demeanour a Widower was another who always speaks well of his deceased Lady and of all the Sex for her sake  Mr  Chapman  and his Lady a wellbehav'd Couple who are not ashamed to be very tender and observing to one another but without that censureable Fondness which sits so ill upon some married Folks in Company  Then there was the  Dean  our good Minister whom I name last because I would close with one of the worthiest and his  Daughter  who came to supply her Mamma's Place who was indispos'd a wellbehav'd prudent young Lady And here were our Fourteen Guests  The Countess of  C  Lady  Davers  Lord  Davers  Mr  H  my dear Mr  B  and your humble Servant  made up the rest of the Company So we had a capacious and brilliant Circle you may imagine and all the Avenues to the House were crouded with their Equipages  The Subjects of Discourse at Dinner were various as you may well suppose and the Circle was too large to fall upon any regular or very remarkable Topicks A good deal of sprightly Wit however flew about between the Earl of  D  Mrs  Towers  and Mr  Martin  in which that Lord suffered as he deserved for he was by no means a Match for the Lady especially as the Presence of the Dean was a Restraint as was very visible upon him and Mr  Brooks  too So much Awe will the Character of a good Clergyman always impress upon even forward Spirits where he is known to have had an inviolable Regard to it himself  Besides the good Gentleman has a genteel and inoffensive Vein of Raillery himself and so was too hard for them at their own Weapons  But after Dinner was over and the Servants were withdrawn Mr  Martin  began to single me out as he loves to do for a Subject of Encomium and made some high Compliments to my dear Mr  B  on his Choice and wished as he often does he could find just such another Person for himself  Lady  Towers  told him That it was a Thing as unaccountable as it was unreasonable that every Rake who loved to destroy Virtue should expect to be rewarded with it And if his  Brother B  had come off so well she thought no one else ought to expect it  Lady  Davers  said It was a very just Observation and she thought 'twas pity there was not a Law that every Man who made a Harlot of an honest Woman should be obliged to marry one of another's making  That would be too severe Mr  B  said it would be Punishment enough if he was to marry his own and especially if he had not seduced her under Promise of Marriage  Then you'd have a Man be obliged reply'd Lady  Davers  to stand to his Promise I suppose Mr  B  Yes Madam  But said she the Proof would be difficult perhaps and the most unguilty Heart of our Sex might be least able to make it out But what say you my Lord  D  continued Lady  Davers  will you and my Lord  Davers  join to bring in a Bill into the House of Peers for the Purposes I mentioned I fansy my Brother would give it all the Assistance he could in the Lower House  Your Ladyship said Mr  Martin  is highly unreasonable I think to propose that It would be enough surely that a Man should be obliged as Mr  B  says to marry the Woman he himself seduced  The Earl said That he thought neither the one nor the other should be imposed upon any Man for that when Womens Virtue was their Glory and they were brought up with that Notion and to avoid the Snares of Men he thought if they yielded they ought to pay the Forfeit and take the Disgrace of it to themselves  May I ask your Lordship said I How it comes to pass that a Woman's Virtue is her Glory and that a Man's shall not be hisOr in other Words Why you think Virtue in a Man is not as requisite as in a Woman  Custom Madam reply'd the Earl has made it very different and those Things which are scandalous in a Lady are not so in a Gentleman  Will your Lordship argue that it should be so because it is so Does not the Gentleman call himself  the Head of his Family Is it not incumbent upon him then to set a good Example And will he plead it as a Fashion that he may do by the dearest Relatives of another Man's Family what if any one should attempt to do by his he would mortally resent  Very well observed Madam said the Dean There is not a Freeliver in the World I believe that can answer that Argument  Mr  B  said the Earl pray speak to your Lady She is too close upon  us  And where Sentiments have been so well supported by a Conduct so uniform and exemplary I chuse not to enter the Lists with such an Antagonist  Well well said Mr  B  since your Lordship will speak in the Plural Number U S let me say We must not pretend to hold an Argument on this SubjectBut however I think my Lord you should not call upon a Man to defend it who bad as he has been never committed a Fault of this Nature that he was not sorry for tho' the Sorrow generally lasted too little a while  Mr  B  said Lady  Towers  has some Merit with me for that Answer And he has still a greater on another Account and that is that he has seen his Error so early and has left his Vices before they have left him  She looked as every one did on the Earl who appeared a little disconcerted as one conscious that he deserved the Reflection And the Dean said Lady  Towers  observes very well For altho' I presume not to make personal Applications yet I must say That the Gentleman who sees his Error in the Prime of Life before he is overtaken by some awakening Misfortune may be called one of the happiest of those who have erred  Ay Mr Dean said Lady  Towers  I can tell you one thing that such another Buttress as you know who taken away from Libertinism and such another Example as a certain Lady every Day gives would go near in a few Years to ruin the Devil's Kingdom in  Bedfordshire    The Gentlemen looked round upon one another upon this home Push And the Lady would not let them recover it See said she how the Gentlemen look upon one another as who should say each to his Companion I'm not so bad as you  Ay said Lady  Davers  I see my Lord  Davers  and the Earl of  D  and Mr  Martin  look most concerned  Faith Ladies said Mr  Martin  this is too severely personal A Man who contends with a Lady has a fine Time of it for we are under Restraint while you say any thing you please But let me tell you there's not a Man of us all 'tis my Opinion that could have attempted what a certain Renegado has attempted tho' he is so readily acquitted  Not so hasty my good Friend said Mr  B  You don't consider well what you say nor of whom For did  I  take upon myself to censure  you  But tho' I may challenge you to say the worst you can because I always dealt upon my own Stock while other People I could name enter'd into a Society and clubbed for Mischief yet I see you deal with a Brother Rake when he reforms as Highwaymen with one of their Gang who would fain withdraw and be honest but is kept among them by Fear of an Impeachment  But is not this Ladies said Mrs  Arthur  a sad thing that so many fine Gentlemen as think themselves concern'd in this Charge should have no way to clear themselves but by Recrimination  Egad said Sir  Thomas Atkyns  I know not what you're about Gentlemen You make but sorry Figures by my Faith I have heard of many  queer  Pranks among my  Bedfordshire  Neighbours but I bless my Stars I was in  France  and  Italy  all the Time  Said Mr  Martin  Mrs  Arthur  spoke the Words  fine Gentlemen  and Sir  Thomas  thought himself obliged to enter upon his own Defence  Ay said the Earl and the best of it is Sir  Thomas  pleads not his  Virtue  neither that he did not join his  Bedfordshire  Neighbours but his  Absence    Gad take me returned he putting a Pinch of Snuff to his Nose with an Air you're plaguy sharp Gentlemen I believe in my Conscience you're in a Confederacy as Mr  B  says and would swear an honest Man into the Plot that would not care for such Company What say you Mr  H  which Side are you of  The Gallows reply'd he in his usual blunt Way are of the Ladies Side and I was always of the Side of the Gallows  That shews return'd Lady  Towers  that Mr  H  is more afraid of the  Punishment  than of  deserving  it  'Tis well said Mr  B  that any Consideration deters a Gentleman at Mr  H  's Time of Life What may be  Fear  now may improve to  Virtue  byandby  Ay said Lady  Davers Jackey  is one of his Uncle's  Foxes  He'd be glad to snap up a straggling Pullet if he was not well look'd after perhaps  Pray my Dear said Lord  Davers  forbear You ought not to introduce two different Conversations in different Companies  I think truly said Mr  B  you should take the Dean's Hint my good Friends else you'll be less  polite  than  personal    Well but Gentlemen said Lady  Arthur  since you seem to have been so hard put to it as  single  Gentlemen what's to be done with the marry'd Man who ruins an innocent body What Punishment Mrs  Towers  shall we find out for such and what Reparation to the Injured This it seems was said with a particular View to the Earl on a late scandalous Occasion But I knew it not till afterwards  As to the Punishment of the Gentleman reply'd Mrs  Towers  where the Law has not provided for it it must be left I believe to his Conscience It will then one Day be heavy enough But as to the Reparation to the Woman so far as it can be made it will be determinable as the unhappy Person  may  or may  not  know that her Seducer is a marry'd Man If she knows he is I think  she  neither deserves Redress nor Pity tho' it alleviates not  his  Guilt But if the Case be otherwise and  she  had no means of informing herself that he was marry'd and he promised to make her his Wife to be sure tho'  she  cannot be acquitted  he  deserves the severest Punishment that can be inflicted What say you Mrs  B  If I must speak my Mind reply'd I I think that since Custom as the Earl said just now exacts so little Regard to Virtue from Men and so much from Women and since the Designs of the former upon the latter are so flagrantly avow'd and known the poor Creature who suffers herself to be seduced either by a  single  or  marry'd  Man  with  Promises or  without  has nothing to do but to sequester herself from the World and dedicate the Remainder of her Days to Penitence and Obscurity As to the Gentleman added I he must be left I doubt to his Conscience as you say Mrs  Towers  which will sooner than he wishes find him out  Every young Lady has not your angelick Perfection Madam said Mr  Dormer  And there are  Cases in which the Fair Sex deserve Compassion ours Execration Love may insensibly steal upon a soft Heart When once admitted the Oaths Vows and Protestations of the favour'd Object who perhaps on all Occasions declaims against the Deceivers of his Sex confirm her good Opinion of him till having lull'd asleep her Vigilance in an unguarded Hour he takes Advantage of her unsuspecting Innocence Is not such a poor Creature to be pity'd And what Punishment does not such a Seducer deserve  You have put Sir said I a moving Case and in a generous Manner What indeed does not such a Deceiver deserve  And the more said Mrs  Chapman  as the most innocent Heart is generally the most credulous  Very true said my Countess for such an one as would do no Harm  to  others seldom suspects any  from  others And her Lot is very unequally cast admir'd for that very Innocence which tempts some brutal Ravager to ruin it  Yet What is that Virtue said the Dean which cannot stand the Test  But said Mrs  Towers  very satirically Whither Ladies are we got We are upon the Subject of Virtue and Honour Let us talk of something in which the  Gentlemen  can join with us This is such an one you see that none but the Dean and Mr  Dormer  can discourse upon  Let us then said Mr  Martin  to be even with  one  Lady at least find a Subject that will be  new  to her And that is CHARITY  Does what I said concern Mr  Martin  more than any other Gentleman retorted Mrs  Towers  that he is disposed to take Offence at it  I think said Mr  B  pardon me Mrs  Towers  a Lady should never make a Motion to wave such Subjects  as those of Virtue and Honour and less still in Company where there is so much Occasion as she seems to think for inforcing them  Nay said she I desire not to wave the Subject I'll assure you And if you think Sir it may do good we will continue it for the sakes of all  you  Gentlemen looking round her archly who are of Opinion you may be benefited by it  We are going into Personals again Gentlemen and Ladies said the Earl  And that won't bear my Lord you seem to think retorted Lady  Davers    A Toast to the King and Royal Family brought on Publick Affairs and Politicks and the Ladies withdrawing to Coffee and Tea I have no more to say as to this Conversation having repeated all that I remember was said to any Purpose for such large Companies you know Miss don't always produce the most agreeable and edifying Subjects But this I was the willinger to recite because I thought the Characters of some of our Neighbours would be thereby made more familiar to you if ever I should have the Happiness to see you in these Parts  I will only add that Miss  L  the Dean's Daughter is a very modest and agreeable young Lady and a perfect Mistress of Musick in which the Dean takes great Delight also and is a fine Judge of it The Gentlemen coming in to partake of our Coffee and Conversation as they said obtain'd of Miss to play several Tunes on the Spinnet and would have me do so too But really Miss  L  so very much surpass'd me that had I regarded my Reputation for playing above the Desire I had as I said and truly said to oblige the good Company I ought not to have pretended to touch a Key after such a Mistress of it Miss has no Voice which is great Pity and at her Request and the Dean's and the Company I sung to  her Play twice or thrice as did Mrs  Towers  whose Voice exceeds her Ear But here Miss will I end my Fourth ConversationPiece  SATURDAY  Morning    THE Countess being a little indispos'd Lady  Davers  and I took an Airing this Morning in the Chariot and had a great deal of Discourse together Her Ladyship was pleased to express great Favour and Tenderness for me gave me a great deal of good Advice as to the Care she would have me take of myself and told me that her Hopes as well as her Brother's all centred in my Welfare and that the Way I was in made her love me better and better  She was pleased to tell me how much she approv'd of the domestick Management and to say that she never saw such Regularity and Method in any Family in her Life where was the like Number of Servants Every one she said knew their Duty and did it without Speaking to in such Silence and with so much apparent Chearfulness and Delight without the least Hurry or Confusion that it was her Surprize and Admiration But kindly would have it that I took too much upon me Yet said she I don't see but you are always fresh and lively and never seem tir'd or fatigu'd and are always dress'd and easy so that no Company find you unprepar'd or unfit to receive them come when they will whether it be to Breakfast or Dinner  I told her Ladyship I owed all this and most of the Conduct for which she was pleased to praise me to her dear Brother who at the Beginning of my  Happiness gave me several Cautions  See  Vol II p  and Instructions for my Behaviour which had always been the Rule of my Conduct ever since and I hoped ever would be To say nothing added I which would be very unjust of the Help I receive from worthy Mrs  Jervis  who is an excellent Manager  Good Creature sweet Pamela  and  charming Girl  were her common Words and she was pleased to attribute to me such a graceful and unaffected Ease and would have it that I have a natural Dignity in my Person and Behaviour which command Love and Reverence at the same time insomuch that my dear Miss I am in Danger of being as proud as any thing For you must believe that her Ladyship's Approbation gives me great Pleasure and the more as I was afraid before she came I should not have come off near so well in her Opinion  As the Chariot passed along she took great Notice of the Respects paid me by People of different Ranks and of the Blessings bestowed upon me by several as we proceeded and said She should fare well and be rich in good Wishes for being in my Company  The good People who know us  will  do so Madam said I but I had rather have their silent Prayers than their audible ones and I have caused some of them to be told so but they say they cannot help it And one honest Man said That everybody's Hearts sprang to their Lips as soon as I appeared and they could not keep their Words in  What I apprehend Madam continued I is that you will be more uneasy Tomorrow when at Church you'll see a good many People in the same way▪ Indeed added I my Story and your dear Brother's Tenderness to me are so much talked of that many  Strangers are brought thither to see us 'Tis the only thing said I and so it is Miss that makes me desirous to go to  London  for by the Time we return the Novelty I hope will cease  Then I mention'd some Verses of Mr  Cowley  which had been laid under the Cushions in our Seat at Church two  Sundays  ago by some unknown Hand and how uneasy they have made me I will transcribe them Miss and give you the Particulars of our Conversation on that Occasion The Verses are these  Thou robb'st my Days of Bus'ness and Delights  Of Sleep thou robb'st my Nights  Ah lovely Thief what wilt thou do  What rob me of Heav'n too  Thou ev'n my Pray'rs dost steal from me  And I with wild Idolatry  Begin to God and end them all to thee  No to what Purpose should I speak  No wretched Heart swell till you break  She cannot love me if she would  And to say Truth 'twere pity that she should  No to the Grave thy Sorrows bear  As silent as they will be there  Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give  So handsomely the Thing contrive  That she may guiltless of it live  So perish that her killing thee  May a Chancemedley and no Murder be  I had them in my Pocket and read them to my Lady who ask'd me If her Brother had seen them I told her It was he that found them under the Cushion I used to sit upon but did not shew them to me till I came home and that I was so vexed at them that I could not go to Church in the Afternoon  What should you be vex'd at my Dear said she How could you help itMy Brother was not disturb'd at them was he  No indeed said I He chid  me  for being so and was pleased to make me a fine Compliment upon it that he did not wonder that every body who saw me lov'd meBut I said This was all wicked Wit was good for to inspire such Boldness in bad Hearts which might otherwise not dare to set Pen to Paper to affront any one  But pray Madam added I don't own I have told you of them lest there should be a Possibility for a Shadow of a Thought that I was prompted by some vile secret Vanity in being admir'd to tell your Ladyship of them When I am sure they have vex'd me more than enough For is it not a sad Thing that the Church should be profan'd by such Actions and such Thoughts as ought not to be brought into it  Then Madam to have any wicked Man  dare  to think of one with impure Notions It gives me the less Opinion of myself that I should be so much as  thought of  as the Object of any wicked Body's Wishes I have called myself to Account upon it whether any Levity in my Looks my Dress my Appearance could imbolden such an affrontive Insolence And I have thought upon this Occasion better of  Julius Caesar  's Delicacy than I did when I read of it who upon an Attempt made on his Wife to which however it does not appear she gave the least Incouragement said to those who pleaded for her against the Divorce he was resolved upon  That the Wife of  Caesar  ought not to be suspected    Indeed Madam continued I it would extremely shock me but to know that any wicked Heart had conceived a Design upon me Upon  me  give me Leave to repeat whose only Glory and Merit is that  I have had the Grace to withstand the greatest of Trials and Temptations from a Gentleman more worthy to be beloved both for Person and Mind than any Man in  England    Your Observation my Dear is truly delicate and such as becomes your Mind and Character And I really think if any Lady in the World is secure from vile Attempts it must be you not only from your Story so well known and the Love you bear to your Man and his Merit to you but from the Prudence and natural  Dignity  I will say of your Behaviour which tho' all graceful Ease and Chearfulness is what would strike dead the Hope of any presumptuous Libertine the Moment he sees you  How can I enough return'd I and kissed her Hand acknowlege your Ladyship's polite Goodness in this Compliment But my Lady you see by the very Instance I have mention'd that a Liberty  is  taken which I cannot think of without Pain  'Tis such a Liberty reply'd my Lady as shews more Despair than Hope and is a Confirmation of my Sentiments on the Prudence and Dignity which not only I but every body attributes to you  Kind kind Lady  Davers  said I again pressing her Hand with my Lips But I will turn my Quarrel since I know not and hope I never shall the vile Transcriber upon the Author of the Verses I think for had they not been written I should not have been thus insulted perhaps  But reply'd my Lady  Cowley  is my favourite Poet He has a beautiful Imagination a vast deal of brilliant Wit and a Chastity too in his Works that hardly any of the Tribe can boast  I once liked him better too said I than I have done since this for he was one of the Poets that my Lady would permit me to read sometimes and his Pieces in Praise of the Country Life and those  charming Lines against Ambition used to delight me much  If e'er Ambition should my Fancy cheat  With any Wish so  mean  as to be great  Continue Heav'n still from me to remove  The humble Blessings of the Life I love  I have taken Notice of these Lines often said my Lady and been pleas'd with them But I think you have no Reason to be out of Conceit with  Cowley  for the ill Use made of his Verses He but too naturally describes the Influence of Love which frequently interferes with our better Duties And there is something very natural and easy and witty in the first Lines And shews that the Poet  laments  the too ingaging Impressions which Love made upon his Mind even on the most solemn Occasions  What rob me of Heav'n too  A bad Heart  Pamela  could not have so lamented or so written  Ah but Madam said I I have seen in your dear Brother's Collection of Manuscripts a Poem in which this very Point nice as it is is touched with much greater Propriety  Can you repeat it my Dear  The Lines I  mean  I can Your Ladyship must know It was upon a Quarrel between a beloved Couple where the Gentleman had been wild and the Lady's illnatur'd Uncle who wanted to break the Match tho' it was designed by her deceased Parents had fomented it so that she would not look upon her Lover nor see him nor receive a Letter of Excuse from him tho' they were betroth'd and she lov'd him dearly This oblig'd him to throw himself in her Way at Church and thus he writes  But O forgive me Heav'n if oft my Fair  Robs thee of my Devoir disturbs my Pray'r  Confounds my best Resolves and makes me prove  That she's too much a Rival in thy Love  These now Madam continued I are the Lines I admire  But  better  Thoughts my happier Hopes suggest  When once this stormy Doubt's expell'd my Breast  When once this  agitated Flame  shall turn  To  steadier  Heat and more  intensely  burn  My dear  MARIA  then thought I will join  And we  one Heart one Soul  shall  all  be  THINE  Ay  Pamela  these are very pretty Lines You must procure me a Sight of the Whole They must needs let me into an entertaining History of a Love QuarrelMean time you must not think ill of my Favourite  Cowley  for I say with a Gentleman whose Judgment and good Heart have hardly any Equal That tho'  Cowley  was going out of Fashion with some yet he should always suspect the Head or the Heart of him or her who could not taste and delight in his Beauties  The Words  She  cannot  love me if she would  And  to say  Truth 'twere pity that she should  Shew the Goodness of the Poet's Heart and even that the Transcriber be he who he will had not the  worst  that he could single out  these  when if he would be shining with borrow'd Rays he might have chosen a much worse Poet to follow  Oh Madam reply'd I say not one Word in behalf of the wicked Transcriber For a Wretch to entertain the Shadow of a Wish for a marry'd  Person is a Degree of Impurity that ought not to be excus'd But to commit such Thoughts to Writing to put that Writing under the Seat of the marry'd Person at Church when her Heart should be ingag'd  wholly  in her first Duties where too it might be more likely to be seen by the Pewkeepers than her and so spread over the whole Parish to the Propagation of bad Ideas whenever I appeared and moreover might come to the Hands of one's Husband who from his own free Life formerly and high Passions as far as the Transcriber knew might be uneasy at and angry with the innocent Occasion of the InsultBesides the Apprehension it must give one that the Man who could take this vile Step might proceed to greater Lengths which my busy Fears could improve to Duelling and MurderThen the Concern it must fill me with to the diverting of my Mind from my first Regards when  any one  looked at me wistfully that  he  might be the Transcriber which must always give me Confusion of Thought Dearest Madam can one forbear being vex'd when all these Imaginations dart in upon a Mind apprehensive as mine Indeed this Action has given me great Uneasiness at times ever since and I cannot help it  I am pleas'd with your Delicacy my Dear as I said before You can never err while thus watchful over your Conduct and I own you have the more Reason for it as you have marry'd a mere  Julius Caesar  an openey'd Rake that was her Word who would on the least Surmizes tho' ever so causeless on your Part have all his Passions up in Arms in Apprehension of Liberties that might be offer'd like those he has not scrupled to take  Oh but Madam said I your dear Brother has given me great Satisfaction in one Point for you must think I should not love him as I ought if I  had not a Concern for his future Happiness as well as his present and that is he has assured me that in all the Liberties he has taken he never attempted a marry'd Lady but always abhorred the Thought of so great an Evil  'Tis pity said her Ladyship that a Man who could conquer his Passions  so far  could not subdue them intirely This shews it was in his own Power to do so and increases his Crime And what a Wretch is he who scrupling under Pretence of Conscience or Honour to attempt Ladies  within  the Pale boggles not to ruin a poor Creature  without  although he knows he thereby most probably for ever deprives her of that Protection by preventing her Marriage which even among such Rakes as himself is deemed inviolable and so casts the poor Creature headlong into the Jaws of Perdition  Ah Madam reply'd I this was the very Inference I made upon the Occasion  And what could he say  He said my Inference was just but call'd me  pretty Preacher  and once having caution'd me  See  Vol II p  not to be overserious with him so as to cast a Gloom as he said over our innocent Injoyments I never dare to urge Matters further when he calls me by that Name  Well said my Lady thou'rt an admirable Girl God's Goodness was great to our Family when it gave thee to it  No Wonder continu'd her Ladyship as my Brother says every body that sees you and has heard your Character loves you And this is some Excuse for the inconsiderate Folly even of this unknown Transcriber  Ah Madam said I but is it not a sad thing that People if they must take upon them to like one's Behaviour in general should have the  worst  instead of the  best  Thoughts upon it If I were as good as I  ought  to be and as some  think  me must they wish to make me bad for that Reason and so to destroy the Cause of that Pleasure which they pretend to take in seeing a body set a good Example For what my dear Lady could a Wretch mean even by the Words your Ladyship thinks most innocent  She cannot love me if she would  And to say Truth  as if this Truth were extorted rather by his  Fears  than his  Wishes    'twere pity that she should  But why then if this be the Case and that he would bear his  Sorrows  as the Poet calls them to the Grave should he not keep them to  himself  make that very  Mind  their Grave which gave them their  Birth  If the bold Creature whoever he be had not thought this might be a Hint that might somehow be improved and a vile Foundation for some viler Superstructure would he have transcribed them and caused them to be placed where they were found Then in my humble Opinion the Thought that is contained in these Lines  Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give  So handsomely the Thing contrive  That she may guiltless of it live  So perish that her killing thee  May a Chancemedley and no Murder be  Is rather a  Conceit  or  Prettiness  that won't bear Examination than that true Wit in which this fine Poet excelsFor if she cannot love him  if she  would  and if it were  pity  that she  should  love him this implies she was a Lady under previous Obligation whether Marriage or Betrothment is the same thing to him Then need the Thing to be so  handsomely contrived  need any Pains be taken if her Repulse  had killed  as Poetical Licence makes him say this Invader of another's Right to bring it in  Chancemedley  since no Jury could have brought it in  Murder  except that Sort of Murder which is called  Felo de se  you know my Lady what a Scholar your Brother has made me So that I presume to think the Poet himself is not so blameless in this as he has taken care to be in most of his Pieces And permit me to make one Observation my good Lady That if the chastest Writers supposing  Cowley  meant ever so well may have their Works and their Thoughts turn'd to be Panders and Promoters of the Wickedness of coarse Minds whose grosser Ideas could not be cloathed in a Dress fit to appear in decent Company without  their  Assistance how careful ought a good Author to be whose Works are so likely to live to the End of Time how he propagates the worst of Mischiefs to such a Duration when he himself is dead and gone and incapable of antidoting the Poison he has spread  Her Ladyship was pleased to kiss me as we sat My charming  Pamela  my  more than Sister  did she sayYes she did say so and made my Eyes overflow with Joy to hear the sweet Epithet How your Conversation charms meI charge you when you get to Town let me have your Remarks on the Diversions you will be carried to by my Brother Now I know what to expect from  you  and  you  know how acceptable every thing will be  to me  that comes from you I promise great Pleasure as well to myself as to my worthy Friends particularly  Lady  Betty  in your unrestrained free Correspondence  Indeed  Pamela  I must bring you acquainted with Lady  Betty  She is one of the Worthies of our Sex and has a fine UnderstandingI'm sure you'll like herBut for the World say it not to my Brother nor let Lady  Betty  know I tell you so if ever you should be acquainted I had carry'd the Matter so far by my officious Zeal to have my Brother marry'd to so fine a Lady not doubting his joyful Approbation that it was no small Disappointment to  her  I can tell you when he marry'd you And this is the best Excuse I can make for my furious Behaviour to you at the Hall For tho' I am naturally very hasty and passionate yet then I was almost mad Indeed my Disappointment had given me so much Indignation both against you and him that it is well I did not do some violent thing by you  Compare this Part of the Conversation with Lady  Davers  's Behaviour to  Pamela Vol II  p to  I believe you  did  feel the Weight of my Hand But what was that'Twas well I did not  kill you dead  these were her Ladyship's WordsFor how could I think the wild Libertine capable of being ingag'd by such noble Motives or Thee what thou artSo this will account to thee a little for my Violence then  Your Ladyship said I all these Things consider'd had but too much Reason to be angry at your dear Brother's Proceedings so well as you always lov'd him so high a Concern as you always had to promote his Honour and Interest and so far as you had gone with Lady  Betty    I tell thee  Pamela  said she that the old Story of  Eleanor  and  Rosamond  run in my Head all the Way of my Journey and I almost wished for a Potion to force down thy Throat And when I came  and found thy lewd Paramour absent for little did I think thou wast marry'd to him tho' I expected thou wouldst endeavour to persuade me to believe it apprehending that his Intrigue with thee would effectually frustrate my Hopes as to Lady  Betty  and him Now thought I all happens as I wishNow will I confront this brazen GirlNow will I try her Innocence as I please by offering to take her with me out of his Hands if she refuses take that Refusal for a Demonstration of her Guilt and then thought I I will make the Creature provoke me in the Presence of my Nephew and my Woman and I hoped to have got that Woman  Jewkes  to testify for me too and I cannot tell what I might have done if thou hadst not got out of the Window as thou didst especially after thou hadst told me thou wast as much marry'd as I was and hadst shewn me his tender Letter to thee which had a quite different Effect upon me than thou hadst hoped for But if I had committed any Act of Violence what Remorse should I have had when I came to reflect and had known what an Excellence I had injured Thank God thou didst escape me thank God thou didst And then her Ladyship folded her Arms about me and kissed me  This was a sad Story you'll say my dear Miss And I wonder what her Ladyship's Passion would have made her do Surely she would not have  killed me dead  indeed surely she would notLet it not however Miss nor you my dear Father and Mother when you see itgo out of your own Hands nor be read for my Lady's sake to any body elseNo Miss not to your own dear MammaIt made me tremble a little even at this Distance to think what a sad thing Passion is when Way is given to its ungovernable Tumults and how it deforms and debases the noblest Minds  We returned from this agreeable Airing but just Time enough to dress before Dinner and then I attended my Lady and we went together into the Countess's Apartment where I received abundance of Compliments from both As this brief Conversation will give you some Notion of that Management and Oeconomy for which they heaped upon me their kind Praises I will recite to you what passed in it and hope you will not think me too vain and the less because what I underwent formerly from my Lady's Indignation half intitles me to be proud of her present Kindness and Favour  Lady  Davers  said Your Ladyship must excuse us that we have lost so much of your Company but here this sweet Girl has entertained me in such a manner that I could have staid out with her all Day and several times did I bid the Coachman prolong his Circuit  My good Lady  Davers  Madam said I has given me inexpressible Pleasure and has been all Condescension and Favour and made me as proud as proud can be  You my dear Mrs  B  said she may have given great Pleasure to Lady  Davers  for it cannot be otherwiseBut I have no great Notion of her Ladyship's Condescension as you call it pardon me Madam said she to her smiling when she cannot raise her Style above the Word  Girl  coming off from a Tour you have made so delightful to her  I protest to you my Lady  C  reply'd her Ladyship with great Goodness that Epithet which once indeed I bestow'd thro' Pride as you'll call it I now give for a very different Reason I begin to doubt whether to call her Sister is not more Honour to myself than to her and to this Hour am not quite convinc'd When I am I will call her so with Pleasure  I was quite overcome with this fine Compliment but could not answer a Word And the Countess  said I could have spared you longer had not the Time of Day compell'd your Return For I have been very agreeably entertained as well as you altho' but with the Talk of my Woman and yours For here they have been giving me such an Account of Mrs  B  's Oeconomy and Family Management as has highly delighted me I never knew the like and in so young a Lady too We shall have strange Reformations to make Lady  Davers  when we go home in our Families were we to follow so good an Example  Why my dear Mrs  B  continued her Ladyship you outdo all your Neighbours And indeed I am glad I live so far from youFor were I to try to imitate you it would still be  but  Imitation and you'd have the Honour of it  Yet you hear and you see by Yesterday's Conversation said Lady  Davers  how much her best Neighbours of both Sexes admire her They all yield to her the Palm unenvying  Then my good Ladies said I it is a Sign I have most excellent Neighbours full of Generosity and willing to incourage a young Person in doing right things So it makes considering what I was more for their Honour than my own For what Censures should not such an one as I deserve who have not been educated to fill up my Time like Ladies of Condition were I not to imploy myself as I do I who have so little other Merit and who brought no Fortune at all  Come come  Pamela  none of your selfdenying Ordinancesthat was Lady  Davers  's WordYou must know something of your own Excellence If you do not I'll tell it you because there is no Fear you will be proud or vain upon it I don't see then that there is the Lady in your Neighbourhood of any Neighbourhood that behaves with a more  proper Decorum or better keeps up the Port of a Lady than you do How you manage it I can't tell but you do as much by a Look and a pleasant one too that's the Rarity as I do by high Words and passionate Exclamations I have often nothing but Blunder upon Blunder as if the Wretches were in a Confederacy to try my Patience  Perhaps Madam said I the Awe they have of your Ladyship because of your high Qualities makes them commit Blunders for I myself have always been more afraid of appearing before your Ladyship when you have visited your honoured Mother than of any body else and have been the more sensibly aukward thro' that very aweful Respect  Psha psha  Pamela  that is not it 'Tis all in yourself I us'd to think my Mamma and my Brother too had as aukward Servants as I ever saw anywhere except Mrs  Jervis  Well enough for a Batchelor indeedBut herethou hast not parted with one ServantHast thou  No my Lady  How said the Countess what Excellence is here All of them pardon me Mrs  B  your Fellowservants as one may say and all of them so respectful so watchful of your Eye and you at the same time so gentle to them so easy so chearful  Don't you think me Miss insufferably vain But 'tis what they were pleased to say 'Twas their Goodness to me and shew'd how much they can excel in generous Politeness So I will proceed  Why this continued the Countess must be  born  Dignity  born  DiscretionEducation cannot give itIf it could why should not  we  have it  The Ladies said many more kind things of me then and after Dinner they mentioned all over again with Additions before my best Friend who was kindly delighted with the Encomiums given me by  two Ladies of such distinguishing Judgment in all other Cases They told him how much they admired my Family Management Then would have it that my Genius was universal for the Imployments and Accomplishments of my Sex whether they consider'd it they were pleased to say as imploy'd in Penmanship in Needlework in paying or receiving Visits in Musick and I can't tell how many other Qualifications which their Goodness made them attribute to me over and above the Family Management saying that I had an Understanding that comprehended every thing and an Eye that penetrated into the very Bottom of Matters in a Moment and was never at a Loss for the  Should be  the  Why  or  Wherefore  and the  How  these were their comprehensive Words I did every thing with so much Celerity clearing all as I went and leaving nothing that was their Observation to recur or come over again that could be dispatched at once By which means they said every Hand was clear to undertake a new Work as well as my own Head to direct it and there was no Hurry nor Confusion but every coming Hour was fresh and ready and unincumber'd so they said for its new Employment and to this they attributed that Ease and Pleasure with which every thing was performed and that I could  do  and  cause  to be done so much Business without Hurry either to myself or Servants  These kind things they would have it they observed in part themselves and in part from the Observations of their Women who looked they said so narrowly into every Part of the Management as if they were Spies upon it but were such faithful ones that it was like a good Cause brought to a strict Scrutiny the brighter and fairer for it  Thus my dear Miss did their Ladyships praise me for what I  ought  to be and I will endeavour to  improve more and more by their kind Admonitions which come cloathed in the agreeable and flattering Shape of Praise the noblest Incitement to the doing of one's Duty  Judge you how pleasing this was to my best Beloved who found in their kind Approbation such a Justification of his own Conduct that could not fail of being pleasing to him especially as Lady  Davers  was one of the kind Praisers  Lord  Davers  was so highly delighted that he rose once begging his Brother's Excuse to salute me and remained standing over my Chair with a Pleasure in his Looks that cannot be expressed nowandthen lifting up his Hands and his goodnatur'd Eye glistening with Joy which a Pierglass gave me the Opportunity of seeing as sometimes I stole a bashful Glance towards it not knowing how or which way to look Even Mr  H  seem'd to be touch'd very sensibly and recollecting his Behaviour to me at the Hall he once cry'd out What a sad Whelp was  I  to behave as I once did to so much Excellence Not Mr  B  that I was any thing uncivil neither but in unworthy Sneers and Nonsense You know me well enoughPx on me for a JackanapesYou call'd me  See  Vol II  p    Tinseld Toy  tho' Madam don't you remember that and said  Twenty or thirty Years hence when I was at Age you'd give me an Answer  Egad I shall never forget your Looks nor your Words neither They were dn'd severe Speeches were they not Sir  O you see Mr  H  said my dear Gentleman  Pamela  is not quite perfectWe must not provoke her for she'll call us both so perhaps for I wear a lac'd Waistcoat sometimes as well as you  Nay Faith I can't be angry said he I deserv'd it richly that I did had it been worse  Thy silly Tongue said my Lady runs on without Fear or Wit What's past is past  Why i'faith Madam I was plaguily wrong and I said nothing of any body but  myself  And have been ready to hang myself since as often as I have thought of my Nonsense  My Nephew said my Lord must bring in Hanging or the Gallows in every Speech he makes or it will not be he  Mr  B  smiling said with Severity enough in his Meaning as I could see by the Turn of his Countenance Mr  H  knows that his Birth and Family intitle him more to the Block than the Rope or he would not make so free with the latter  Good very good by  Jupiter  said Mr  H  laughing The Countess smil'd Lady  Davers  shook her Head at her Brother and said to her Nephew Thou'rt a goodnatur'd foolish Fellow that thou art  For what Madam Why the Word  foolish  Aunt What have I said now  Nothing to any Purpose indeed said she when thou dost I'll write it down  Then Madam said he have your Pen and Ink always about you when I'm present The Devil's in't if you won't put that down to begin with  This made every one laugh What a happy thing it is thought I that Goodnature generally accompanies this Character else my dear Miss how would some People be supportable  But here I'll break off 'Tis Time you'll say But you know whom I write to as well as to you and they'll be pleas'd with all my silly Scribble So excuse one Part for that and another for Friendship's sake and then I shall be wholly excusable to you  Now the Trifler again resumes her Pen I am in some Pain Miss for Tomorrow because of the Rules we observe of late in our Family on  Sundays  and of going thro' a Croud to Church which will afford new Scenes to our noble Visitors either for Censure or otherwise But I will sooner be censured for doing what I think my Duty than for the Want of it and so will break nothing into our usual Way  I hope I shall not be thought ridiculous or as one who aims at Works of Supererogation for what I think is very short of my Duty Some Order surely becomes the Heads of Families and besides it would be discrediting one's own Practice if one did not appear at one Time what one does at another For that which is a Reason for discontinuing a Practice for some Company would seem to be a Reason for laying it aside for ever especially in a Family visiting and visited as ours  And I remember well a Hint given me by my dearest Friend once on another Subject  See  Vol II  p    That it is in every one's Power to prescribe Rules to himself after a while and Persons see what is one's Way and that we are not to be put out of it  But my only Doubt is that to Ladies who have not been accustomed perhaps to the  necessary  Strictness I should make myself censurable as if I aimed at too much Perfection For however one's Duty is one's Duty and ought not to be dispensed with yet when a Person who uses to be remiss sees so hard a Task before them and so many great Points to get over all to be no more than tolerably regular it is rather apt to frighten and discourage than to allure and one must proceed as I have read Soldiers do in a difficult Siege Inch  by Inch and be more studious to intrench and fortify themselves as they go on gaining upon the Enemy than by rushing all at once upon an Attack of the Place be repulsed and perhaps obliged with great Loss to abandon an hopeful Enterprize  And permit me to add that young as I am I have often observed that overgreat Strictnesses all at once injoin'd and insisted upon are not fit for a beginning Reformation but for stronger Christians only and therefore generally do more Harm than Good in such a Circumstance  What a miserable Creature am I said a neighbouring Widow Gentlewoman whom I visited in her Illness at her own Desire tho' a Stranger to me but by Name if all the Good  you  do and the strict Life  you  live is no more than absolutely necessary to Salvation  I saw the poor Gentlewoman thro' Illness and low Spirits was ready to despond and to comfort her I said Dear Madam don't be cast down God Almighty gives us all a Light to walk by in these our dark Paths and 'tis my humble Opinion He will judge us according to the  unforced  and  unbyassed  Use we make of that Light I think it my Duty to do several Things which perhaps the Circumstances of others will not permit them to do or which they on serious and disinterested Reflection may not think absolutely necessary to be done In each Case our Judgments are a Law to each and I ought no more to excuse myself from doing such Parts as I think my Duty than you to condemn yourself for not doing what does not appear to you so strictly necessary And besides Madam you may do as much Good one way as I another and so both may be equally useful in the general System of Providence  But shall I not be too grave my dear Miss Excuse me for this is  Saturday  Night and as it was a very good Method which the ingenious Authors of the  Spectators  took generally to treat their more serious Subjects on this Day so I think one should when one can consider it as the preparative Eve to a still better  SUNDAY  NOW my dear Miss by what I have already written it is become in a manner necessary to acquaint you briefly with the Method my dear Mr  B  not only permits but incourages me to take in the Family he leaves to my Care as to the  Sunday  Duty  The worthy Dean at my Request and by my Beloved's Permission recommended to me as a sort of Family Chaplain for  Sundays  a young Gentleman of great Sobriety and Piety and sound Principles who having but lately taken Orders has at present no other Provision And this Gentleman comes and reads Prayers to us about Seven in the Morning in the lesser Hall as we call it a retired Apartment next the little Garden for we have no Chapel with us here as in your Neighbourhood And this generally with some suitable Exhortation or Meditation out of some good Book which the young Gentleman is so kind to let me chuse nowandthen when I please takes up little more than half an Hour  We have a great Number of Servants of both Sexes and myself my good Mrs  Jervis  and my  Polly Barlow  are generally in a little Closet which when we open the Door is but just a Separation and that's all from the Hall  Mr  Adams  for that is our young Clergyman's Name has a Desk at which sometimes Mr  Jonathan  makes up his running Accounts to Mr  Longman  who is very scrupulous of admitting any body to the Use of his Office because of the Writings in his Custody and the Order he values himself upon having every thing in  About Seven in the Evening the young Gentleman comes again and I generally let me have what Company I will find time to retire for about another Halfhour and my dear Mr  B  connives at and excuses my Absence if inquir'd after tho' for so short a time I am seldom miss'd  To the young Gentleman I shall present every Quarter Five Guineas and Mr  B  presses him to accept of a Place at his Table at his Pleasure But as we have generally a good deal of Company his Modesty makes him decline it and sit down when he pleases with Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  who have a separate Table  Mr  Longman  is so kind as to join with us very often in our  Sunday  Office and Mr  Colbrand  seldom misses and they tell Mrs  Jervis  that they cannot express the Pleasure they have to meet me there and the Edification they receive as they are so kind to say from my Example and the chearful Temper I am always in which does 'em good to look upon me And they will have it that I do Credit to Religion But if they do but think so it must have been of Service to me in the Order I have now established as I hope and that thro' less Difficulties than I expected to meet with especially from the  See  Vol I  p  Vol II  p    Cookmaid but she says she comes with double Delight to have the  Opportunity to see her beloved Lady as she calls me it seems at every Word  My best Beloved dispenses as much as he can with the Servants for the Evening Part if he has Company or will be attended only by  John  or  Abraham  perhaps by Turns and sometimes looks upon his Watch and says 'Tis near Seven and if he says so they take it for a Hint they may be dispens'd with for half an Hour and this Countenance which the dear Gentleman gives me has not contributed a little to make the Matter easy and delightful to me and to every one  I am sure my dear Miss were only Policy to be considered this Method must be laudable for since I have begun it there is not a more diligent a more sober nor more courteous Set of Servants in any Family in a great Way We have no Broils no hard Words no Revilings no Commandings nor Complainings and Mrs  Jervis  's Government is made so easy as she says that she need not speak twice and all the Language of the Servants is Pray  John  or Pray  Jane  do so or so and they say Their dear Master's Service is a Heaven upon Earth  When I part from them on the breaking up of our Assembly they generally make a little Row on each Side to the Halldoor and when I have made my Compliments and paid my Thanks to Mr  Adams  one whispers as I go out God bless you Madam And so says another and another and indeed every one and bow and court'sy with such Pleasure in their honest Countenances as greatly delights me And I say if it so happens So my good FriendsI am glad to see youNot one absentor but oneas it falls out This is very obliging I cry And thus I shew them that I take Notice if any body be not there And back again I go to pay my Duty to my Earthly Benefactor and he is pleased to say sometimes that  I come to him with such a Radiance playing about my Eyes and shining over my whole Face as gives him double Pleasure to behold me and often he tells me afterwards that but for appearing too fond before Company he could meet me as I enter with Embraces as pure as my own Heart  I hope in time I shall prevail upon the dear Gentleman to give me his CompanyBut thank God I am inabled to go thus far alreadyI will leave the rest to his Providence For I have a Point very delicate to touch upon in this Particular and I must take care not to lose the Ground I have gained by too precipitately pushing at too much at once This is my Comfort that next to being uniform  himself  is that Permission and Incouragement he gives  me  to be so and the Pleasure he takes in seeing me so delightedAnd besides the dear Gentleman always gives me his Company to Church O how happy should I think myself if he would be pleased to accompany me to the Divine Office which yet he has not done tho' I have urg'd him as much as I durst One thing after another he says we shall be better and better I hope But nobody is good all at once But my dear Miss as I consider this as the Seal of all the rest and he himself has an awful Notion of it I shall hardly think my dear Mr  B  's Morals fully secur'd till then  Mrs  Jervis  ask'd me on  Saturday  Evening If I would be concerned to see a larger Congregation in the lesser Hall next Morning than usual I said No by no means She said Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  the two Ladies Women and Mr  Sydney  my Lord  Davers  's Gentleman and Mr  H  's Servant and the Coachmen and Footmen belonging to our noble Visitors who are she says all great Admirers of our Family Management and good Order having been told our Method begg'd to join in it I knew I  should be a little dash'd at so large a Company but the Men being pretty orderly for Lords Servants and Mrs  Jervis  assuring me that they were very earnest in their Request I consented to it  When at the usual Time attended by my  Polly  I went down I found Mr  Adams  there to whom I made my first Compliments and every one of our own People waiting for me Mr  Colbrand  excepted whom Mr  H  had kept up late the Night before together with Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  and Mr  Sydney  with the Servants of our Guests who as also worthy Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  and Mr  Jonathan  paid me their Respects and I said This is early rising Mrs  Lesley  and Mrs  Worden  you are very kind to countenance us with your Companies in this our Family OrderMr  Sidney  I am glad to see you How do you▪ Mr  Longman  And looked round with Complacency on the Servants of our noble Visitors And then I led Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  to my little Retiringplace and Mrs  Jervis  and my  Polly  followed and throwing the Door open Mr  Adams  began some select Prayers and as the young Gentleman reads with great Emphasis and Propriety and as if his Heart was in what he read all the good Folks were exceedingly attentive  After Prayers Mr  Adams  read a Meditation from a Collection made for private Use which I shall more particularly mention byandby and ending with the usual Benediction I thank'd the worthy Gentleman and reproach'd him in Mr  B  's Name for his Modesty in declining our Table and thanking Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  receiv'd their kind Wishes and hasten'd blushing thro' their Praises to my Chamber where being alone I pursued the Subject for an Hour till Breakfast was ready when I attended the Ladies and my  best Beloved who had told them of the Verses plac'd under my Cushion at Church  We set out my Lord and Lady  Davers  and myself and Mr  H  in our Coach and Mr  B  and the Countess in the Chariot both Ladies and the Gentlemen splendidly dress'd but I avoided a Glitter as much as I could that I might not seem to vie with the two PeeressesMr  B  said Why are you not full dress'd my DearI said I hop'd he would not be displeased If he was I would do as he commanded He answer'd As you like best my Love You are a charming Creature in every Dress  The Chariot first drawing up to the ChurchDoor Mr  B  led the Countess into the Church My Lord  Davers  did me that Honour and Mr  H  handed his Aunt thro' a Croud of Gazers many of whom as usual were Strangers The Neighbouring Gentlemen and their Ladies paid us their silent Respects but the Thoughts of the wicked Verses or rather as Lady  Davers  will have me say wicked Action of the Transcriber of them made me keep behind in the Pew But my Lady with great Goodness sat down by me and whisperingly talked a good deal between whiles to me with great Tenderness and Freedom in her Aspect which I could not but take kindly because I know she intended by it to shew every one she was pleas'd with me  Among other things she said softly Who would wish to be a King or Queen  Pamela  if it is so easy for Virtue and Beauty so she was pleas'd to say to attract so many sincere Admirers without any of their GrandeurLook round my dear Girl and see what a solemn Respect and mingled Delight appears in every Countenance  And pressing my Hand Thou art a charming Creature such a noble Modesty and yet such a becoming Dignity in thy whole Appearance No wonder  that every one's Eyes are upon thee and that thou bringest so many booted Gentlemen as well as Neighbours to croud the Church to behold thee  Afterwards she was pleased to add taking my Hand and my dear Gentleman and the Countess heard her for she raised her Voice to a more audible Whisper I am proud to be in thy Company and in this solemn Place I take thy Hand and acknowlege with Pride my  Sister  I looked down for here at Church I can hardly at any time look up for who can bear to be gaz'd at soAnd softly said Oh my good Lady how much you honour me the Place and these surrounding Eyes can only hinder me from acknowleging as I ought  My best Friend with Pleasure in his Eyes said pressing his Hand upon both ours as my Lady had mine in hers you are two beloved Creatures Both excellent in your way God bless you both And you too my dear Brother said my Lady The Countess whisper'd You should spare abody a little You give one Ladies and Mr  B  too much Pleasure all at once Such Company and such Behaviour adds still more Charms to Devotion and were I to be here a Twelvemonth I would never miss once accompanying You to this good Place  Mr  H  thought he must say something and addressing himself to his noble Uncle who could not keep his goodnatur'd Eye off me I'll be  hang'd  my Lord if I know how to behave myselfWhy this outdoes the ChapelI'm glad I put on my new Suit And then he look'd upon himself as if he would support as well as he could his Part of the general Admiration  But think you not my dear Miss and my dearest Father and Mother that I am now at the Height of my Happiness in this Life thus favour'd by Lady  Davers  The Dean preached an excellent Sermon but I need not to have said that Only to have mention'd that  he  preached was saying enough  My Lord led me out when Divine Service was over and being a little tender in his Feet from a Gouty Notice walked very slowly Mr  B  led the Countess and Mr  H  his Aunt Lady  Towers  and Mrs  Brooks  join'd us in the Porch and made us their Compliments as did Mr  Martin  Will you favour us with your Company home my old Acquaintance said Mr  B  to that Gentleman I can't having a Gentleman my Relation to dine with me but if it will be agreeable in the Evening I will bring him with me to taste of your  Burgundy  for we have not any such in the County I shall be glad to see you and any Friend of yours reply'd Mr  B  Mr  Martin  whisper'd It is more however to admire your Lady I can tell you that than your Wine Get into your Coaches Ladies said he with his usual Freedom our Maiden and Widow Ladies have a fine Time of it whereever you come By my Faith they must every one of them quit this Neighbourhood if you were to stay in it but all the Hopes they have are that while you're in  London  they'll have the Game in their own Hands  Sister said Lady  Davers  most kindly to me in Presence of many who in a respectful manner gather'd near us Mr  Martin  is the same Gentleman he us'd to be I see  Mr  Martin  Madam said I smiling has but one Fault He is too apt to praise whom he favours at the Expence of his absent Friends  I am always proud of your Reproofs Mrs  B  reply'd he  Ay said Lady  Towers  that I believe And therefore I wish for all our sakes you'd take him oftener to Task Mrs  B  Lady  Towers  Lady  Arthur  Mrs  Brooks  and Mr  Martin  all claim'd Visits from us and Mr  B  making Excuses that he must husband his Time because of being oblig'd to go to Town soon proposed to breakfast with Lady  Towers  the next Morning dine with Mr  Arthur  and sup with Mrs  Brooks  and as there cannot be a more social and agreeable Neighbourhood anywhere his Proposal after some Difficulty was accepted and our usual visiting Neighbours were all to have Notice accordingly at each of the Places  I saw Sir  Thomas Atkyns  coming towards us and fearing to be stifled with Compliments I said Your Servant Ladies and Gentlemen and giving my Hand to Lord  Davers  stept into the Chariot instead of the Coach for People that would avoid Bustle sometimes make it Finding my Mistake I would have come out but my Lord said Indeed you shan't And I'll step in because I'll have you all to myself  Lady  Davers  smil'd Now said she while the Coach drew up is my Lord  Davers  pleas'd but I see Sister you were tir'd with Part of your Company in the Coach  'Tis well contriv'd my Dear said Mr  B  as long as you have not depriv'd me of this Honour taking the Countess's Hand and leading her into the Coach  Will you excuse all this Impertinence my dear MissI know my dear Father and Mother will be pleas'd with it and you will have the Goodness to bear with me on that Account for their kind Hearts will be delighted to hear every minute thing in relation to Lady  Davers  and myself  When Mr  Martin  came in the Evening with his Friend who is Sir  William G  a polite young Gentleman of  Lincolnshire  he told us a deal of the Praises lavish'd away upon me by several genteel  Strangers one saying to his Friend he had travelled twenty Miles to see me  My Lady  Davers  was praised too for her Goodness to me and the Gracefulness of her Person the Countess for the noble Serenity of her Aspect and that charming Ease and Freedom which distinguish her Birth and Quality My dear Mr  B  he said was greatly admired too but he would not make  him  proud for he had Superiorities enough already that was his Word over his Gentlemen Neighbours But I can tell you said he that for most of your Praises you are obliged to your Lady for having rewarded her Excellence as you have done For one Gentleman added he said He knew no one but you could deserve her and he believed you did from that Tenderness in your Behaviour to her and from that Grandeur of Air and Majesty of Person that seem'd to shew you form'd for her Protector as well as Rewarder Get you gone to  London  both of you said he I did not intend to tell you Mr  B  what was said of you And indeed I see no such extraordinary Excellence do you Sir to his Friend in that GentlemanSir  William  said Mr  B  was all that was polite and noble and it was no Wonder that every body pronounced us both the charmingest Couple they had ever seen  The Women of the two Ladies had acquainted their Ladyships with the Order I observed for the Day and the devout Behaviour of the Servants  c  And about Seven I withdrawing as silently and as unobserved as I could was surprised as I was going thro' the great Hall to be joined by both  I shall come at all your Secrets  Pamela  said my Lady and be able in time to cut you out in your own way I know whither you are going  My good Ladies said I forgive me leaving you I will attend you in half an Hour  No my Dear said Lady  Davers  the Countess and I have resolved to attend  you  for that Halfhour and we will return to Company together  Is it not descending too much my Ladies as to the Company  If it is for us it is for you said the Countess so we will either act up to you or make you come down to us and we will judge of all your Proceedings  Nay my dear Ladies said I and sat down on the first Chair  Nay my dear  Pamela  returned my Lady shew us the Way  If I must I mustBut I was much abashed  Every one but  Abraham  who attended the Gentlemen and all their Ladyships Servants and their two Women and Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  were there which pleas'd me however because it shew'd me that even the Strangers by this their second voluntary Attendance had no ill Opinion of the Service But they were all startled ours and theirs to see my Ladies accompanying me  I stept up to Mr  Adams  I was in hopes Sir said I we should have been favour'd with your Company at our Table  Your Ladyship said he will excuse me I did not think myself Company for such noble Guests as were there  A Gentleman and a Scholar is Company said the Countess for the first Quality  Well Sir said I you see the Nobleness of these Ladies They come now to be obliged to you for your good Offices and you'll have no better way of letting them return their Obligation than to sup tho' you would not dine with them  My Lady tapp'd me on the NeckGenteelly said This was like my Sister her own Self Mr  Longman  said she how do youWe are come to be Witnesses of my Sister's Goodness and the Family Decorum  We have a blessed Lady Madam said he And your Ladyships Presence augments our Joys  Let us follow you  Pamela  said she We must learn of you what we are to do  I led to the little Closet with as much Presence of Mind as I could and my two Ladies followed me and Mrs  Jervis  and Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  stood just without the Door being half shut for their Ladies sakes  I should have said we were not at Church in the AfternoonAnd when I do not go we have the Evening Service read to us as it is at Church which Mr  Adams  performed now with his usual Distinctness and Fervour and the Ladies seem'd not at all uneasy altho' we had a Meditation besides  When all was concluded I said Now my dearest Ladies excuse me for the sake of the Delight I take in seeing all my good Folks about me in this decent and obliging mannerIndeed I have no Ostentation in it if I know my own Heart Indeed I have not  The Countess and my Lady  Davers  delighted to see such good Behaviour in every one sat a Moment or two looking upon one another in Silence and then my Lady  Davers  caught me in her Arms Beloved deservedly beloved of the kindest of Husbands what a Blessing art thou to this Family  And to every Family said the Countess who have the Happiness to know and the Grace to follow her Example and saluted me too But where said my Lady collectedst thou all this good Sense and fine Spirit in thy Devotions  The Bible my dear Ladies said I is the Foundation of all But this and their CommonPrayer  Book and the Duty of Man our good Folks have every one of them and are so good as to imploy themselves in them at all Leisure Opportunities on other Days For which Reason that I may diversify their Devotions I have with the Assistance of Mr  Adams  and by Advice of the Dean made Extracts from several good Pieces which we read on these Days Mr  Adams  said my Lady  Davers  will you oblige me with a Copy of my Sister's Book at your Leisure He readily ingag'd to do this and the Countess desir'd another Copy which he also promised  Lady  Davers  then turning herself to Mrs  Jervis  How do you good Woman said sheWhy you are now made ample Amends for the Love you bore to this dear Creature formerly  You have an Angel and not a Woman for your Lady my good Mrs  Jervis  said the Countess  Mrs  Jervis  folding her uplifted Hands together O my Lady you know not our Happiness no not one Half of it We were before bless'd with Plenty and a bountiful Indulgence by our good Master but our Plenty brought on Wantonness and Pride But now we have Peace as well as Plenty and Peace of Mind my dear Lady in doing all in our respective Powers to shew us thankful Creatures to God and to the best of Masters and Mistresses  Good Soul said I and was sorc'd to put my Handkerchief to my Eye Your Heart is always overflowing thus with Gratitude and Praises for what you so well merit from us  Mr  Longman  said my Lady assuming a sprightly Air altho' her Eye twinkled to keep within its Lids the precious Water that sprang from a noble and wellaffected Heart I am glad to see you here attending your pious young LadyWell might you  love her honest Man well might youI did not know there was so excellent a Creature in any Rank  Madam said the other worthy Heart unable to speak but in broken SentencesYou don't know indeed you don't what awhat ahap happyFamily we areTruly we are like unto  Alexander  's Soldiers every one fit to be a General so well do we all know our Duties and  practise  them too let me sayNay and please your Ladyship we all of us long till Morning comes thus to attend my Lady and after that is past we long for Evening for the same Purpose For she is  so  good to us You cannot think how good she is But permit your honoured Father's old Servant to say one Word more that tho' we are always pleased and joyful on these Occasions yet we are in Transports to see our Master's noble Sister thus favouring us with your Ladyship too to the Countess and approving our young Lady's Conduct and Piety  Blessing on you all said my LadyLet us go my Ladylet us go Sisterfor I can stay no longer  As I slid by following their Ladyships How do you Mr  Colorand  said I softly I fear'd you was not well in the MorningHe bow'd Pardon me Madame I vas leetell indispose dat ish true  Now my dear Miss will you forgive me all this Selfpraise as it may seemYet when you know I give it you and my dear Parents as so many Instances of my Lady  Davers  's Reconciliation and Goodness to me and as it will shew what a noble Heart that good Lady has at Bottom when her Pride of Quality and her Passion have subsided and her native good Sense and Excellence take place I flatter myself I may be the rather excused and especially  as I hope to have my dear Miss  Darnford  's Company and Countenance one Day in this my delightful  Sunday  Imployment  I should have added for I think a good Clergyman cannot be too much respected that I repeated my Request to Mr  Adams  to oblige us with his Company at Supper but he so very earnestly begg'd to be excused and with so much Concern of Countenance that I thought it would be wrong to insist upon it tho' I was sorry for it because I am sure as of any thing that Modesty is always a Sign of Merit  We return'd to the Gentlemen as soon as Supper was ready and as chearful and easy as Lady  Davers  observ'd as if we had not been present at so solemn a Service And this said she after the Gentlemen were gone makes Religion so pleasant and delightful a thing that I profess I shall have a much higher Opinion of those who make it a regular and constant Part of their Imployment than ever I had But I have seen added her Ladyship very humorously such wry Faces and such gloomy Countenances among some of your pious Folks in and after a solemn Office that quite dishearten'd me for I thought after such an Exercise that it would be a Sin to go to Bed with a Smile upon one's Face or without sighing and groaning at such a Rate as must rob one of all the Comforts of Life  Then said she I was once I remember when a Girl at the House of a very devout Man for a Week with his Granddaughter my Schoolfellow and there were such Preachments against Vanities and for Selfdenials that were we to have followed the good Man's Precepts tho' indeed not his Practice for well did he love his Belly half God Almighty's Creatures and Works would have been useless and Industry would have been banish'd the Earth  There added her Ladyship for she was in a pleasant Vein have I heard the good Man confess himself guilty of such Sins that if true and by his hiding his Face with his broadbrim'd Hat it look'd a little bad against him he ought to have been hang'd on a Gallows fifty Foot high  I said that this Overgloominess was not Religion I was persuaded but Constitution and Mistake and I was sorry always when I met with it for tho' it might betoken a pious Mind it certainly shew'd a narrow one and I fear'd did more Harm than Good  These Reflections as I said fell from my Lady after the Gentlemen were gone when she recounted to her dear Brother the Entertainment as she was pleas'd to call it I had given her On which she made high Encomiums as did the Countess and they praised also the natural Dignity which they imputed to me saying I had taught them a way they never could have found out to descend to the Company of Servants and augment their Respect and Veneration for one at the same time And  Pamela  said my Lady you are certainly very right to pay so much Regard to the young Clergyman for that makes all he reads and all he says of greater Efficacy with the Auditors facilitates the Work you have in View to bring about and in your own Absence for your Monarch may not always dispense with you perhaps strengthens his Influences and encourages the young Gentleman besides  MONDAY  I AM to thank you my dear Miss for your kind Letter approving of my Scribble  See Letter  XXVIII  of this Volume  When you come to my  Saturday  's and  Sunday  's Accounts I  shall try your Patience But no more of that for as you can read them or let them alone I am the less concern'd especially as they will be more indulgently receiv'd somewhere else than they may merit so that my Labour will not be wholly lost  I congratulate you with all my Heart on your dismissing Mr  Murray  for besides that some of his Qualities are not to be approv'd by a Lady of your Taste and Judgment I will never give my Consent that any Gentleman shall have the Honour of calling my Miss  Darnford  his who can so easily resign his Pretensions to her and address her Sister  You are extremely diverting my dear Miss with your Greater and Lesser BearStars and I could not help shewing it to Mr  B  And what do you think the free Gentleman said upon it I am half afraid to tell you But do now you are so happily disengag'd get Leave to come and let us two contrive to be even with him for it You are the only Lady in the World that I would join with against him  He said That your Characters of Mr  Murray  and Miss  Nanny  which he called severe but I won't call them so without your Leave look'd a little like pretty Spite and as if you were sorry the Gentleman took you at your WordThat was what he saidPray let us punish him for it Yet he called you charming Lady and said a great deal in your Praise and join'd with me that Mr  Murray  could not possibly deserve you who was so easyto part with you  But  Pamela  said he I know the Sex well enough Miss  Polly  may not love Mr  Murray  yet to see her Sister address'd and complimented and prefer'd to herself by one whom she thought so late in her own Power to choose or to refuse is a mortifying Thing And young Ladies cannot bear to sit by neglected while two Lovers are playing Pugs Tricks with one another  Then said he all the Preparations to Matrimony the Cloaths to be bought the Visits to be paid and received the Compliments of Friends the busy Novelty of the Thing and the Day to be fixed and all the little foolish Humours and Nonsense attending a concluded Courtship when  one Sister  is to engross all the Attention and Regard the new Equipages and so forth these are all Subjects of Mortification to the  other  though she had no great Value for the Man perhaps  Well but Sir said I a Lady of Miss  Darnford  's good Sense and good Taste is not to be affected by these Parades and has well consider'd the Matter no doubt and I dare say rejoices rather than repines at missing the Gentleman  Thus my dear Miss had we a Dispute about you But I hope you will leave the happy Pair for they are so if they think themselves so together and Sir  Simon  to rejoice in his accomplish'd SoninLaw elect and give us your Company to  London  For who would stay to be vex'd by that illnatur'd Miss  Nanny  as you own you was at your last writing  But I will proceed with my Journal and the rather as I have something to tell you of a Conversation the Result of which has done me great Honour and given me inexpressible Delight Of which in its Place  We pursued Mr  B  's Proposal returning several Visits in one Day for we have so polite and agreeable a Neighbourhood that all seem to concur in a Desire to make every thing easy to one another And as I mentioned before hearing Mr  B  's Intention to set out for  London  as soon as our noble Guests should leave us they dispensed with  Formalities being none of them studious to take things amiss and having a general good Opinion of one another's Intentions not to disoblige  We came not home till Ten in the Evening and then found a Letter directed from Sir  Jacob Swynford  Uncle by the HalfBlood to Mr  B  acquainting him That hearing his Niece Lady  Davers  was with him he would be here in a Day or two being then upon his Journey to pay a Visit to his Nephew and Niece at the same time  This Gentleman is very particularly odd and humoursome and his eldest Son being next Heir to the maternal Estate if Mr  B  should have no Children has been exceedingly dissatisfied with his debasing himself in marrying me and would have been better pleased had he not married at all perhaps  There never was any cordial Love between Mr  B  's Father and him nor between the Uncle and Nephew and Niece for his Positiveness Roughness and Selfinterestedness too though very rich has made him but little agreeable to the generous Tempers of his Nephew and Niece yet when they meet which is not above once in four or five Years they are always very civil and obligeing to him  Lady  Davers  wonder'd what could bring him hither now for he lives in  Herefordshire  and seldom stirs ten Miles from home Mr  B  said he was sure it was not to compliment him and me on our Nuptials No rather said my Lady to satisfy himself if you are in a way to cut out his own Cubs Thank God we are said my dearest Friend Whenever I was strongest set against Matrimony the only Reason I had to weigh against my  Dislike to the State was that I was unwilling to leave so large a Part of my Estate  See  Vol II p  to that Family  My Dear said he to me don't be uneasy but you'll see a Relation of mine much more disagreeable than you can imagine But no doubt you have heard his Character  Ah  Pamela  said Lady  Davers  we are a Family that value ourselves upon our Ancestry but upon my Word Sir  Jacob  and all his Line have nothing else to boast of And I have been often ashamed of my Relation to them  No Family I believe my Lady has every Body excellent in it reply'd I But I doubt I shall stand but poorly with Sir  Jacob    He won't dare to affront you my Dear said Mr  B  although he'll say to you and me and my Sister too blunt and rough things But he'll not stay above a Day or two and we shall not see him again for some Years to come so we'll bear with him I am now coming to the Conversation I hinted at  TUESDAY  ON  Tuesday  Mr  Williams  came to pay his Respects to his kind Patron I had been to pay a Visit to the Widow Gentlewoman I mentioned before and on my Return went directly to my Closet so knew not of his being there till I came down to Dinner for Mr  B  and he were near two Hours together in Discourse in the Library  When I came down Mr  B  presented him to me My Friend Mr  Williams  my Dear said he  Mr  Williams  how do you do said I I am glad to see you  He rejoiced he said to see me look so well and had long'd for an Opportunity to pay his Respects to his worthy Patron and me before But had been prevented twice when he was upon the Point of setting out  Mr  B  said I have prevail'd upon my old Acquaintance to take up his Residence with us while he stays in these Parts Do you my Dear see that every thing is made agreeable to him  To be sure Sir I will  Mr  Adams  being in the House Mr  B  sent to desire he would dine with us if it were but in respect to a Gentleman of the same Cloth who gave us his Company And with great Modesty he came But neither of the Gentlemen knew how to speak at first before Lady  Davers  who is so majestick a Lady and has so majestick a Character too that every one has an Awe upon them in her Presence  Mr  B  when Dinner was over and the Servants were withdrawn said My Dear Mr  Williams  's Business in Part was to ask my Advice as to a Living that is offer'd him by the Earl of who is greatly taken with his Preaching and Conversation  And to quit yours I presume Sir said Lord  Davers  No the Earl's is not quite so good as mine and his Lordship would procure him a Dispensation to hold both What would you advise my Dear  It becomes not me Sir said I to meddle with such Matters as these  Yes my Dear it does when I ask your Opinion  I beg Pardon Sir said IMy Opinion then is That Mr  Williams  will not care to do any thing that  requires  a Dispensation and which would be unlawful without it  Your Ladyship said Mr  Williams  speaks exceedingly well  I am glad Mr  Williams  said I that you approve of my Sentiments You see they were required of me by one who has a Right to command me in every thing otherwise this Matter is above my Sphere and I have so much good Will to Mr  Williams  that I wish him every thing that will contribute to make him happy  Well my Dear said Mr  B  but what would you advise in this Case The Earl proposes that Mr  Williams  's present Living be supply'd by a Curate to whom no doubt Mr  Williams  will be very genteel and as we are seldom or never there his Lordship thinks we shall not be displeas'd with it and insists upon it that he will propose it to me as he has done  Lord  Davers  said I think this may do very well Brother But what pray Mr  Williams  do you propose to allow to your Curate Excuse me Sir but I think the Clergy do so hardly by one another generally that they are not to be surpriz'd that some of the Laity treat them as they do  Indeed said Mr  H  that's well observed for I have heard it said twenty and twenty times If you would know how to value a Clergyman and what he deserves for spending his whole Life in the Duties of his Function you need but form your Opinion upon the Treatment they give to one another and or  l  a Year would be thought too much even for him who does all the Labour  Who says my Nephew speaks not well says my Lord  Oh said my Lady No Wonder This is  Jackey  's Peculiar He has always something to say against the Clergy For he never lov'd them because his Tutors were Clergymen and since said her Ladyship very severely he never got any Good from them why should they expect any from him  Always hard upon my poor Nephew said Lord  Davers    Thank you Aunt said Mr  H  Mr  Williams  said Mr  H  's Observation was but too true that nothing gave greater Cause of Scandal than the Usage some even of the dignified Clergy gave their Brethren That he had always lamented it as one of the greatest Causes of the Contempt with which the Clergy are too generally treated  He was proceeding but Lady  Davers  said I am not at all surpriz'd at their Treatment of one another for if a Gentleman of Education and Learning can so far forget what belongs to his Function as to accept of Two Livings when One would afford him a handsome Maintenance it is no wonder that such a one would make the most of it for does he not as good as declare that he takes it for that very Purpose  I must not let this Argument proceed said Mr  B  without clearing my worthy Friend He is under no Difficulty about holding the Two He proposes  not  to do it and like a good Man as I always thought him is of Opinion he  ought not  to do it But here is his Difficulty and all his Difficulty He is very desirous to oblige his good Friend the Earl who is very pressing to have him  near him but apprehending that I may take it amiss if he relinquishes my Living he came to ask my Advice and after we had talked a good deal of the Matter I told him we would refer it to Pamela who was a kind of Casuist in such Matters of Equity and good Order as fell within the Compass of her Observation and Capacity And so my Dear said he give us your free Opinion for this is a Subject you have spoken your Mind to me upon once before  I am very glad Sir replied I that Mr  Williams  's own Resolution was so conformable to what I wish'd it to be and indeed expected from his Character and I can more freely speak my Mind upon the Occasion though I am but a poor Casuist neither  You remember my Dear said Mr  B  what you observed to me in favour of the Clergy and their Maintenance when we fell occasionally upon that Subject a while ago I found you had considered the Point and thought you spoke well upon the Subject Let us hear your Opinion now upon it  Indeed reply'd I I say now as I then took the Liberty to say that I have so general a Goodwill for the Function that if my Wishes could have Effect there is not one of it but should have a handsome Competency at least such a one as to set him above Contempt And this I am persuaded would be a great Furtherance to the Good we expect from them in teaching the lower Rank of People as well as the higher their Duties and making them good Servants and useful Members of the Commonwealth  But my Dear you took Notice of some things that would if you can recollect them be very  apropòs  to the Subject we are now upon  I remember Sir said I we were talking of Impropriations I took the Liberty to express myself a little earnestly against Impropriations and I remember you stopped my Mouth at once upon that Head  As how Sister said Lady  Davers  Ay as how Mrs  B  said the Countess  Why Madam Mr  B  was pleased to say that when the Clergy would come into a Regulation for the more equal and useful Disposition of the Revenues that at present were in the Church he would be the first that would bring in a Bill for restoring to it all that it had lost by Impropriations and other Secularizations and leave it upon the Publick to make Satisfaction to such of the Laity as would be Sufferers by the Restoration  That was not my Dear what I meant returned Mr  B  You was particularly against Dispensations which is the Point before us now  I remember Sir I did say that as there are so many Gentlemen of the Function who have no Provision at all I could not wish any one of it should hold Two Livings especially if they cannot perform the Duties of both and where One would afford a tolerable Competence Much less I remember I took the Liberty to add could I think it excusable that a Gentleman should rate the Labours of his Brother who does  every  thing so low as is too frequently the Case and pay himself so well for doing  nothing  at all  This is what I mean returned Mr  B  and I thought you observed very well my Dear For  my own Part I have always been of Opinion that the Clergy who do thus make the best Excuse that can be made for Impropriators and LayPatrons For here is a Gentleman the Son of a Layman I speak to general Cases is sent to the University and takes Orders He has Interest perhaps to get two or more Livings and hires a Person who is as deserving as himself but destitute of Friends at a low Rate to do the Duties of one of them We will suppose in his Favour that he has several Children to provide for out of these and makes that his Pretence for oppressing the Person he employs to do his own Duty Some of these Children are Males some Females and not one in five of the former is brought up to the Church and all that he saves for them and gives them out of what he squeezes from his unhappy Brother is it not secularizing as it were at least as far as he can do it the Revenues appropriated to the Church And can  he  whatever others may blame an Impropriator for applying that Portion of the Produce of ChurchLands to  his  LayFamily which the other intends for the LayFamily he is endeavouring to build up Some one or two of which Impropriator's Sons may possibly too in order to possess the Living in their Father's Gift be brought up to the Church What is the Difference I would fain know  If the Clergy were always to have done thus continued Mr  B  should we not have wanted many Endowments and charitable Foundations which we now have And I am verry sorry to have Reason to say that we owe such Sort of Works more to the Piety of the Clergy of past Times than the present for now let us cast our Eye upon the Practices of some of our Prelates for who is it that looks not  up first for Examples to that venerable Order And we shall find that too many among them seem more intent upon making a Family as it is called and thereby secularizing as I observed as much as they can the Revenues of the Church than to live up either to the ancient Hospitality or with a View to those Acts of Munificence which were the Reason for endowing the Church with such ample Revenues as it once had and still has were it not so unequally distributed and in so few Hands  But dear Sir said I what a sad Hardship do the inferior Clergy labour under all this Time To be oppressed and kept down by their Brethren and the Laity too This is hard indeed'Tis pity methinks this at least could not be remedied  It will hardly ever be done my Dear The Evil lies deep 'tis in human Nature and when that can be mended it will be better but I see not how it can be expected while those who have most Influence to procure the Redress are most interested to prevent it And the Views of others aspiring to the same Power and Interest make too many wish to have things left as they are although they have no present Benefit by it And those would join in a Cry of the Church's Danger were the Legislature to offer at a Redress  'Tis pity Sir said I the Convocation are not permitted to sit They would perhaps undertake this Province and several others for the Benefit of the whole Body of the Clergy and I should think such Regulations would come best from them  So it is my Dear would they employ themselves and their Deliberations in such good Works But 'tis a sad Thing to consider that there is little Good to be expected from Bodies of Men in  general for altho' an Individual cares not to pull down upon himself the Odium of a bad or unpopular Action yet when there are many to share it among them I see not that they stand upon it But far be it from me to say this with a View to Convocations  as  Convocations I speak what is but too generally the Case in all Bodies of Men whatever whether Clergy or Laity And let us look into the greater or lesser Corporations and Societies throughout the Kingdom and you'll find if you excuse a poor Witicism that Bodies are really  Bodies  and act too often as if they had no  Souls  among them  I hope Sir said the Countess that when you judge thus hardly of Bodies you include the two supreme Bodies  Thou shalt not  said Mr  B  I know these Reverend Gentlemen looking at Mr  Williams  and Mr  Adams  will tell me  speak Evil of the Rulers of thy People  But I wish I could always defend what I am loth at any time to censure But were you to read or attend to the Debates in both Houses which sometimes happen in Cases almost selfevident you would find it impossible not to regret that you are now and then under a Necessity to join with the Minority as well in your House Lord  Davers  as in ours  I wish Brother reply'd his Lordship I could differ from you with Reason But this always  was  and I fear always  will be  so more or less in every Session  But to return to our first Subject said Mr  B  You know my Dear how much Pleasure I take to hear your Opinion in Cases of natural Equity And you must tell us freely what you would advise your Friend Mr  Williams  to do  And must I Sir speak my Mind before so many Better Judges  Yes  Sister  said her Ladyship a Name she is now pleased to give me freely before Strangers after her dear Brother's Example who is kindest tho' always kind at such Times you  must  if I may be allow'd to say  must    Why then said I I beg leave to ask Mr  Williams  one Question that is Whether his present Parishioners do not respect and esteem him in that particular Manner which I think every Body must who knows his Worth  I am very happy Madam in the GoodWill of all my Parishioners and have great Acknowlegements to make for their Civilities to me  I don't doubt said I but it will be the same whereever you go for bad as the World is a prudent and good Clergyman will never fail of Respect But Sir if you think your Ministry among them is attended with good Effects if they esteem your Person with a Preference and listen to your Doctrines with Attention methinks for  their  Sakes 'tis pity to leave them were the Living of  less  Value as it is of  more  than the other For how many People are there who can benefit by one Gentleman's Preaching rather than another's altho' possibly the one's Abilities may be no way inferior to the other's There is a great deal in a  Delivery  as it is called in a Way a Manner a Deportment to engage People's Attention and Esteem and as you are already in Possession of their Esteem you are sure to do much of the Good you aim and wish to do For where the Flock loves the Shepherd all his Work is easy and more than half done and without that let him have the Tongue  of an Angel and let him live the Life of a Saint he will be heard with Indifference and oftentimes as his Subject may be with Disgust  I paused here but every one being silent As to the Earl's Friendship Sir continued I you are best Judge what Force that ought to have upon you and what I have mention'd wou'd be the only Difficulty with me were I in Mr  William  's Case To be sure it will be an high Obligation upon his Lordship and so he ought to think it that you quit a better Living to oblige him And he will be bound in Honour to make it up to you For I am far from thinking that a prudent Regard to worldly Interest misbecomes the Character of a good Clergyman and I wish all such were set above the World for their own Sakes as well as for the Sakes of their Hearers since Independency gives a Man Respect besides the Power of doing Good which will inhance that Respect strengthen his Influences and of consequence give greater Efficacy to his Doctrines  The Countess mentioned hereupon the Saying of Dr  Fisher  Bishop of  Rochester  who was beheaded in the Reign of  Henry  VIII because he would not own the King's Supremacy This Prelate being offer'd a richer Bishoprick he would not accept of it saying  "He looked upon his Bishoprick as his Wife and he should not think it excusable to part with his Wife because she was poor"  This brought so many Reflections upon the frequent Translations and the Earnestness with which richer Bishopricks were sought after that I was very sorry to hear or think there was Occasion for them And I did take the Liberty to say that as Mr  B  had observ'd  the Fault was in human Nature and tho' it was an inexcusable one perhaps we that censur'd them might find it hard in their Circumstances to resist the Temptation  Mr  B  said He wish'd for the Sake of the Clergy in general that there was a Law against Translations and that all the Bishopricks in  England  were made equal in Revenue For do we not see said he that the Prelates almost to a Man vote with Power And by this means contribute not a little to make themselves and the whole Body of a Clergy so numerous and so deserving too as that of the Church of England a Byword to Freethinkers of all Denominations who are ever ready to take Occasion to malign them and their venerable Order  Would you not asked Lord  Davers  have the two Primacies distinguished in Revenue  No said Mr  B  the Distinction of Dignity and Precedence would be enough if not too much for where there is but one Pope the whole College of Cardinals Seventy in Number are always looking up to and gaping after the Chair And I would have no Temptations laid in the Way of good Men to forfeit their Characters and weaken their Influences which are of so much Consequence for Examplesake to the Publick Weal  I think said Lord  Davers  there was some Reason for the Celibacy of the Clergy in the  Roman  Church at first altho' the Inconveniencies arising from it are too many and too obvious to wish the Restraint so general For the Provision for Families and Children furnishes so natural and so laudable a Pretence to a Clergyman to lay up all he  can for them that their Characters suffer not a little on that Account  If we look round us said Mr  B  and see how many good and worthy Families are sprung from the Clergy and look abroad and see what are too often the Effects of Celibacy in the  Roman  Church and the Scandal worse than what we complain of ever thrown upon them even by Bigots of their own Communion we shall have sufficient Reason to condemn the Celibacy which that Church enjoins Besides a bad Mind an oppressive or covetous Nature will be the same whether marry'd or single For have we not seen to what a scandalous Heighth Nepotism has been carried in that Church And has not a Pope of a private and narrow Spirit done as much for his Nephews and Nieces and perhaps nearer Relations under those Names as he could have done for his Sons and Daughters So still  here  too we must resolve all into that common Sewer of Iniquity Human Nature and conclude That a truly good Man will not do a bad Thing upon any the nearest and most affecting Considerations and that a bad Man will never want a Pretence to display his evil Qualities nor Flatterers neither if he has Power to defend him for the worst he can do  I well remember the Argument when I was at  Rome  used to the Pope on such an Occasion His Holiness declar'd against Nepotism saying That he would never look upon the Revenues of the Church as the Patrimony of his private Family and forbad his numerous Relations who on his Promotion swarm'd about him with Faces as hungry as if they were so many  NorthBritons  travelling Southward for Prefermentthat was Mr  B  's  Word spoken pleasantly to think of him in any other Light than that of the common Father of all his People and as having no other Relation but Merit  This was setting out well you'll say but what was the EventWhy two thirds of his Relations rushed into Orders directly and it was not long before Parasites were found to represent to the Holy Father that it was a Sin to deprive the Church of so many excellent Props and Buttresses and that for the Good of the Publick he ought to prefer them to the first Dignities so that the good Man overcome with their Reasons and loth to continue in so great a Sin grac'd the Cardinalate with one the Episcopate with half a Dozen and the richest Abbacies with a Score or two and the Emperor having occasion to make Interest with his Holiness found Merit enough in some of the LayRelations to create them Princes and Counts of the Holy  Roman  Empire  But Sir said I for I am always sorry to hear things said to the Discredit of the Clergy because I think it is of publick Concern that we venerate the Function tho' not the Failings of Particulars have I not been a silent Witness that you have made the same Observations on a Minister of State who tho' he shall be perhaps the first to blame this Disposition in a Clergyman will be equally ready to practise it himself to Relations and Children full as worthless to the Exclusion of the Worthy So that Sir this is all Human Nature still and should we not be tender in our Censures of the one when we are so ready to acquit the other  There's this Difference Mrs  B  said the Countess From the one we expect a better Example  from the other no Example fit to be followed And this is one Reason that makes a First Minister generally so hated a Thing because he resolves all Considerations into Self and is beloved by no Body but those to whom he gives the Overflowings of such Benefits as he has not Relations enough to heap them upon  Well Mr  Adams  said I if I may be allow'd to be so serious does not this shew the Excellency of the Prayer we are taught by the supreme Teacher and that Part of it  Lead us not into Temptation  For it seems too natural a Consequence that no sooner are we tempted but we  deliver up our selves to Evil  Right Sister said Lord  Davers  and this ends in Mr  B  's  human Nature  again  What remains then said Lady  Davers  but that we take the World as we find it Give Praise to the Good Dispraise to the Bad and every one try to mend  one  Yet I wish said Mr  B  so overtender are many good Clergymen of the Failings they would not be guilty of in their Brethren that we should avoid displeasing them if they were to know the Freedom of this Conversation tho' we are all so welldisposed to reverence their Function  I hope otherwise said Mr  Williams  for it is but giving  due  Praise and Dispraise as my Lady says and were evil Actions to go uncensur'd good ones would lose their Reward and Vice by being put upon a Foot with Virtue in this Life would meet with too much Countenance  But give me leave said Lady  Davers  to interpose a little in the Matter we have departed from that of the Curate and Dispensation and when I have deliver'd my Sentiments I insist upon it that  Mrs  B  will as freely give us hers as if I had been silent  Dispensations are usual Things Mr  Williams  may pay a young Gentleman handsomely and the Censure we have pass'd is only upon such as do not To a young Man at first setting out a good Curacy will be very acceptable If he has Merit it will put him in a Way of shewing it and he may raise himself by it If he has not he will not deserve more And Mr  Williams  may marry perhaps and have a Family to provide for His Opportunities may not always be the same The Earl may die and he should be excused to make the best Use of his Interest and Favour for the very Reason Mrs  B  gave that as he is a good Man it will strengthen his Influences And come Brother you know I am always for prescribing Here is a worthy young Gentleman in our Eye that won't take it amiss to begin with a Curacy And you shall give  your  Dispensation previous to the legal one on Condition that Mr  Williams  will permit you to present his Curate and thus all will be solv'd  Both the Gentlemen bow'dand Mr  Williams  was going to speak But Mr  B  said Take my Sister at her Word  Pamela  and if you have any thing to say to this Scheme speak it freely as if her Ladyship had been silent for I perceive by your downcast Eye and Silence you could say something if you would  Ay pray do said my Lady I love to hear you speak You always make me think of something I had not consider'd before  I am very loth to say anything on so nice a Subject Indeed it would not become me There is so much  Generosity and Benevolence in my good Lady's Scheme that I ought not  Ought not  said my dearest Friend interrupting me None of your  ought nots  I know you are always forming in your Mind Notions of Right and Wrong in the common Cases of Life Let us therefore have your Opinion in this Matter more fully than you have hitherto given it and deliver it too without Hesitation and with that Ease and Freedom that are born with you for I can tell you that when thro' the Corruptions of Human Nature we lose the Distinction of Right and Wrong I know not where we can better apply ourselves than to such as you to recover them  I bow'd and said If you will have it so Sir it must be so and I will then bespeak all your kind Allowances casting my Eye around me to each and tell you all I think upon this Matter and when I have done submit my poor Sentiments as becomes me to your superior Judgments  Thus then I would sayPardon me my Lady for taking your Ladyship's Words for my Theme as I remember them and hardly any thing falls from your Ladyship that I do not remember  That Dispensations are usual Things  I am sure I am going to display my Ignorance because knowing nothing of their Original or Design I must presume them to be very ancient in this Kingdom and introduced only when there were fewer Clergymen than Benefices Was there ever such a Time  They smil'dNay now you would command me Sir to speak when I needed to do nothing else to expose my self There was a Time as I have read that there were so few Scholars that the  Benefit of Clergy was allow'd to some sort of Criminals who could do no more than read because the Commonwealth could so ill spare learned Men And might not there be a Time then when Dispensations were allowed to worthy Men because it was difficult to find enow of such as deserv'd that Character to fill the Church Preferments  Tell us  Pamela  said Mr  B  whether you do not intend this as a Satire upon the Practice or is it really your pretty Ignorance that has made you pronounce one of the severest Censures upon it that could be thought of  I smiled and said Indeed Sir I think only some such Reason or a worse must be the Original of Dispensations for is it right that one Gentleman shall have two or three Livings the Duties of no more than one of which he can personally attend while so many are destitute of Bread almost and exposed to Contempt the too frequent Companion of Poverty And what though Custom may have sanctified it to be sure that is all that can and a good Man will not do all he may do without incurring a Penalty because there is in every thing a Right and a Wrong and because be the Custom what it will a Man should regulate his Actions by his Conscience and the Golden Rule  My good Lady says Mr  Williams  may pay a Gentleman handsomely I don't doubt but Mr  Williams  would and this I am sorry to say it would be doing what is not so often done as one would wish But may I be permitted to ask For  what  would he pay the Gentleman handsomelyWhy for doing that Duty for him which in Conscience and Honour he ought to do himself and which when he takes Institution  and Induction he engages solemnly to do And pray excuse me my Dear Everybody that was my foolish Word which made them smileTo what End is all thisOnly that the Gentleman who does all the Labour in the Vineyard shall live upon or  l per Annum  more or less while the Gentleman who has  best  nothing but  best  Interest another of my foolish Phrases shall receive twice and perhaps three times the Sum for doing nothing at all Can any Dispensation my dear Friends make this a just or equitable thing Indeed if the Living be so poor as too many of them are that a Man cannot comfortably and creditably subsist without putting Two poor ones together to make One tolerable one that is another Thing But pray now my good Mr  Williams  excuse me if Mr  Adams  can live on a Curacy of or  l  a Year cannot another Gentleman live unless his Rectory or Vicarage bring him or Mr  Adams  may marry as well as Mr  Williams  and both I believe will find God's Providence a better Reliance than the richest Benefice in  England    A good Curacy no doubt continued I may be a comfortable thing at setting out to a young Gentleman But if here be a Rectory or Vicarage of  l  a Year for Example for if it be of no more Value than a good Curacy he must be content is not that  l  a Year the Reward for doing such and such Labour And if this be the stated Hire for this Labour to speak in the Scripture Phrase  is not the Labourer worthy of his Hire  Or is he that does  not  labour to go away with the greatest Part of it  If the Gentleman my Lady is pleased to say has Merit this Curacy may put him in the way of shewing it But does the Manifestation of Merit and the Reward of it always go together  My Lady is so good as to observeBut may I Madam be excused  Proceed proceed ChildI shall only have a Care of what I say before you for the future that's all  And I too said Mr  H  which made them smile  Nay now my Lady  Proceed I tell youI only wonder as my Brother has said on another Occasion where thou gottest all these equitable Notions  My Lady is so good as to observe proceeded I for they were pleased to be attentive that Mr  Williams  should make use of his Opportunities I know her Ladyship speaks this rather in generous Indulgence to the usual Practice than what always ought to be the chief Consideration for if the Earl should die may not some other Friend arise to a Gentleman of Mr  Williams  's Merit  As to strengthning of a good Man's Influence which is a Point always to be wish'd I would not say so much as I have done if I had not heard Mr  Longman  say and I am sure I heard it with great Pleasure that the Benefice Mr  Williams  so worthily enjoys is a clear  l  a Year  But after all does Happiness to a Gentleman a Scholar a Philosopher rest in a greater or lesser IncomeDoes it not rather rest in a happy Competency or Mediocrity Suppose my dear Mr  B  had  l  a Year added to his present large Income would that increase his Happiness That  it would add to his Cares is no Question but could that Addition give him one single Comfort which he has not already And if the dear Gentleman had or less might he be less happy on that Account No surely for it would render a greater Prudence on my humble Part necessary and a nearer Inspection and greater Frugality on his own and he must be contented if he did not as now perhaps lay up every Year so long as he lived within his IncomeAnd who will say that the Obligation to greater Prudence and Oeconomy is a Misfortune  The Competency therefore the Golden Mean is the Thing and I have often considered the Matter and endeavoured to square my Actions by that Consideration For a Person I have this Notion dear Sir from that Manuscript Poem you was pleased to shew me of not preferring People above their native Condition and which has been an excellent Lesson to me For a Person I was going to say who being not born to an Estate is not satisfied with a Competency will know no Limits to his Desires Such a one that an Acquisition of or  l  a Year will not satisfy will not sit down contented with any Sum Although he may propose to himself at a Distance that such and such an Acquisition will be the Height of his Ambition yet he will as he approaches to that advance upon himself farther and fartherand know no Bounds till the natural one is forced upon him and his Life and his Views end together  Now let me humbly beg Pardon of you all Ladies and Gentlemen said I turning my Eye to each but most of you my good Lady whose Observations I have made so free with If  you  can  forgive me it will be an Instance of your Goodness that I may hope for but hardly can expect Will you my dear Lady said I and laid my Hand upon her Ladyship's in a supplicatory Manner for she sat next me  I think  not  said her Ladyship I think I  ought  notShould I Brother Can I my Lord Ought I my Lady CountessBrother Brother if you have been in any Degree contributing to the Excellency of thiswhat shall I call her How cunningly do you act to make her imbibe your Notions and then utter them with such Advantage that you have the secret Pride to find your own Sentiments praised from her Mouth But I will forgive you both he it as it will for I am sure outdone as I am in Thought Word and Deed and by so young a Gypseythat was her Word it is by one that would outdo every body else as well as me only I would except your LadyshipNone of your Exceptions Lady  Davers  reply'd the CountessI know not in so young a Lady whether I should most envy or admire her Excellence  Well but since I have the Pleasure said I to find myself forgiven may I be indulged a few Moments Prattle more only just to observe that the State of the Case I have given is but one Side of the Question that which a good Clergyman in my humble Opinion would chuse to act But when we come to the other Side what it would be kind we of the Laity should think and act by them that is another thing For when we think of the Hardships the Clergy lie under more than almost any other Body of Men we shall see they are intitled to better Usage than they often meet with  Here in the first Place a Youth is sent to the University after a painful Course to qualify him for it He endangers his Health and impairs his Constitution by hard Study and a sedentary Life and after he has passed such a Number of Years he is admitted into Orders perhaps gets a small Fellowship turns Tutor a painful Imployment and his Education having been designed for all his Portion and that expended in it he at last by Interest or Favour gets a Curacy or little Living of or  l  a Year if less so much the worse and is obliged to maintain himself in a genteel Appearance out of that and be subject not seldom to the Jests of Buffoons and Rakes at a great Man's Table where the  Parson  is too often the Butt to receive the supposed witty Shafts of such as can allow themselves to say any thing If he marries which possibly too he is kept from contrary to his Wishes of all Men he is the least to follow his own Liking since Prudence too often obliges him to take the Person his Inclination would not  If Children follow what melancholy Views has he of providing for them did not his strong Reliance on Providence exercise his Faith against worldly Appearance  Then has he too often to contend for his Dues the Produce of his poor Income with churlish and ignorant Spirits whom his Function would make him wish to smooth and instruct who though they farm and pay to the Landlord for no more than nine Tenths of the Lands they occupy hardly think it a Sin to cheat the Parson of his Tythe who however has the same Right to it by the Laws of the Land as the Gentleman has to the Estate or the Tenant to the Produce of his Farm  This obliges the poor Gentleman to live in a State of War among a People with whom both his Duty and Inclination would make him desirous to cultivate a good Understanding And what Benefits can result from his Ministry in such a Situation when the People to be instructed look upon him as an Invader of their Substance at the very Time that they are robbing him of what is legally his  In the next Place I presume to think that the Clergy are too much looked upon by some as a detached Body as I may say from the rest of the People and as Persons acting upon a separate Interest quite opposite to that of the Laity When possibly that very Churl who refuses them their Right or would cheat them of it has a View to bring up one of his Family to the Church and hopes to get him provided for out of its Revenues And are not the Clergy moreover the Fathers the Sons the Uncles the Brothers of the Laity who shall set themselves against their Maintenance And must their Education debar them of those Comforts which it better qualifies them to enjoy and which it incapacitates them any other way to procure  What Opportunity have not the Laity in general of all Degrees and Ranks to make their Lives easy and happy to what the Clergy have Here is a middling Family with three or four Sons Suppose the Father's Circumstances will allow him to bring up one to the  Law  What Opportunities has  he  unenvied to make a Fortune Another is brought up to  Trade  If he has but tolerable Success in the World in what Ease and Affluence does he support himself and provide for his Family The  Physick Line  what Fortunes are not raised in that And no body envies any of these But the Son whose Inclination shall lead him perhaps  best  to deserve and  most  to require an easy and comfortable Subsistence and who ought wholly to appropriate himself to the Duties of his Function is grudged envied and treated as if he were not a Son of the same Family and had not a natural Right and Stake in the same Commonwealth  There are 'tis true Preferments and some great ones and Honours too in the Church but how few compared to the Numbers of the Clergy or to those Livings which are so poor as can hardly set a Man above Penury and ContemptAnd how are those few ingross'd by the Descendants or Dependants of the Rich and Powerful And what by Commendams Dispensations and suchlike Contrivances how does one Man of Interest and Address swallow up the Provision which was designed for several as deserving perhaps at least as himselfFor my good Lady you have forgiven me and must not be displeased a Gentleman's Friends  may die off  and he must you know  make the best Use of his Opportunities    O you dear Saucebox as my Brother calls youHow dare you by that arch pretty Look triumph over me thusLet me Brother give her a Slap for thisI'm sure she deserves it  I think she is a little insolent indeed Lady  Davers  But to the Case in Hand There is so much Truth in what  Pamela  says of the Hardships to which the Clergy the inferior Clergy particularly are subjected that I wonder any Gentleman who can chuse for himself and has no probable  Prospects should enter into Orders under such Discouragements  I humbly conceive Sir said I that there can be but one  good  Inducement and that is what the Apostle hints at in the Words  If in  this Life  only we have Hope we are of all Men most miserable    Well said Mr  B  so much as this is their Motive so much are they intitled to that better Hope and may that better Hope never deceive them  But I have the Pleasure to acquaint this Company that I had a mind only to hear what  Pamela  who as I hinted talked to me learnedly on this very Subject a few Days ago would say when she came Face to Face to her two worthy Friends Mr  Williams  and Mr  Adams  and so I desired Mr  Williams  would let her run on if I could set her into the Subjectelse my old Acquaintance was resolved not to hold both Livings since  either  he was so good as to say would afford him as handsome a Provision as he wished for his only Difficulty being about obliging the Earl or whether he should not disoblige me if he complied with that Nobleman's Request  Indeed Madam said Mr  Williams  this is the very Case and after what I have heard from your Ladyship so he call'd me I would not for the World have been of another Mind nor have put it upon any other Foot than I did  You are a good Gentleman said I and I have such an Opinion of your Worthiness and the Credit you do your Character that I would sooner suspect my own Judgment and so I ought than yours But pray Sir what may I ask have you determined to do  Why Madam reply'd he I am stagger'd in that too by the Observation your Ladyship made that where a Man has the Love of his Parishioners he ought not to think of leaving them  Else Sir I find you had rather inclined to oblige the Earl though the Living be of  less  Value This is very noble Sir it is more than generous  My Dear said Mr  B  I'll tell you for Mr  Williams  's Modesty will not let him speak it before all the Company what  is  his Motive and a worthy one you'll say it is Excuse me Mr  Williams  for the reverend Gentleman blush'd  The Earl has of late Yearswe all know his Charactergiven himself up to Carousing and he will suffer no Man to go from his Table sober Mr  Williams  has taken the Liberty to expostulate as became his Function with his Lordship on this Subject and upon some other Irregularities in so agreeable a manner that the Earl has taken a great Liking to him and promises that he will suffer his Reasonings to have an Effect upon him and that he shall reform his whole Houshold if he will come and live near him and regulate his Table by his own Example  The Countess is a very good Lady and privately presses Mr  Williams  to oblige the Earl And this is our worthy Friend's main Inducement with the Hope which I should not forget to mention that he has of preserving untainted the Morals of the two young Gentlemen the Earl's Sons who he fears will be carried away by the Force of such an Example And he thinks as the Earl's Living has fallen mine probably will be better supplied than the Earl's if he as he kindly offers gives it me back again otherwise the Earl as he apprehends  will find out for his some Gentleman if such an one can be found as will rather further than obstruct his own Irregularities as was the unhappy Case of the last Incumbent  Well said Lady  Davers  and so said the Countess we shall always have the highest Respect for Mr  Williams  for a Conduct so genteel and so prudent But Brother will you and will you Mr  Williams  put this whole Affair in all its Parts into Mrs  B  's Hands since you have such Testimonies  both  of you of her Rectitude of Thinking and Acting  With all my Heart Madam replied Mr  Williams  and I shall be proud of such a Direction  What say  you  Brother You are to suppose the Living in your own Hands again will you leave the whole Matter to my  Sister  here  Come my Dear says Mr  B  let us hear how you'd wish it to be order'd I know you have not need of one Moment's Consideration when once you are Mistress of a Point  Nay said Lady  Davers  that is not the Thing I repeat my Demand Shall it be as Mrs  B  lays it out or not  This is a weighty Matter my good Sister and bad as I have been I think Patrons are accountable in a great measure for the Characters of the Persons they present and I do assure you that had I twenty Livings in my Gift I should think I ought not to prefer my Brother to any one of them if his Morals and Character were not likely to do Honour to the Church as well as to my Presentation And I expected to hear from  Pamela  when she was enumerating the Hardships of the Clergy of that scandalous Practice of some Patrons who rob the  regularlybred Clergymen by pushing into Orders some Kinsman or Friend or Friend's Kinsman or Friend when a Living falls in let his Character or Qualifications be ever so faulty and defective I could name you several such Instances that ought to make the Ordainers as well as the Ordained  blush  as were I to borrow one of  Pamela  's serious Inferences I would say it will one Day make them both  tremble  when they come to give an Account of the Trusts committed to them  Well says my Lady I have a noble Brother that's true What Pity you ever were wicked at all But come and laid her Hand upon mine this same good Girl will be a Blessing to you Nay why say I  will  be she  is  and the greatest that mortal Man can receive But still I must have you put this Matter into Mrs  B  's Hands  Conditionally I will Provided I cannot give satisfactory Reasons why I  ought not  to conform to her Opinion for this as I said is a Point of Conscience with me and I made it so when I presented Mr  Williams  to the Living and have not been deceived in that Presentation  To be sure said I that is very reasonable Sir and on that Condition I shall the less hesitate to speak my Mind because I shall be sure of being in no Danger to commit an irreparable Error  I know well Lady  Davers  added Mr  B  the Power your Sex have over ours and their subtle Tricks and so will never be drawn in in my weakest Moments to make a blindfold Promise There h  ve been several Instances both in sacred and profane Story of Mischiefs done by such Surprizes So you must allow me to suspect myself when I know the dear Slut's Power over me and have been taught by the inviolable Regard she pays to her own Word  to value mineAnd now  Pamela  speak all that's in your Heart to say  Well Sir said I with your  requisite  Condition in my Eye I will But let me see that I state the Matter right And preparative to it pray Mr  Williams  tho' you have not been long in Possession of this Living yet maybe you can compute what it is likely by what you know of it to bring in clear  Madam said he by the best Calculation I can make I thank you for it good Sir it may one Year with another be reckoned at l  per Annum  It is the best Living within twenty Miles of it having been improved within these two last Years  If it was l and would make you happier for  that  Sir is the thing I should wish it you said I and think it short of your Merits But pray Sir what is the Earl's Living valued at  At about l Madam  Well then reply'd I very pertly I believe now I have it  Mr  Williams  for Motives most excellently worthy of his Function inclines to surrender up to Mr  B  his Living of l  per Annum  and to accept of the Earl's Living of l  per Annum  Dear Sir I am going to be very bold but under  your  Condition neverthelessLet the Gentleman to whom you shall present the Living of  F  allow l  per Annum  out of it to Mr  Williams  till the Earl's Favour shall make up the Difference to him and no longerAndbut I dare not name the Gentleman For how dear Sir were I to be so bold shall I part with my Chaplain  Admirable most admirable said Lord and Lady  Davers  in the same Words The Countess praised the Decision too and Mr  H  with his Let me be hang'd and his 'Fore Gadsand such Exclamations natural to him made  his  Plaudits  Mr  Williams  said He could wish with all his Heart it might be so and Mr  Adams  was so abash'd and surpris'd he could not hold up his Headbut Joy danced in his silent Countenance for all that  Mr  B  having hesitated a few Minutes Lady  Davers  called out for his Objection or Consent according to Condition and he said I cannot so soon determine as that prompt Slut did I'll withdraw one Minute  He did so as I found afterwards to advise like the considerate and genteel Spirit he possesses with Mr  Williams  whom he beckon'd out and to examine whether he was in Earnest willing to give it up or had any body he was very desirous should succeed him telling him that if he had he thought himself oblig'd in Return for his worthy Behaviour to him to pay a particular Regard to his Recommendation And so being answer'd as he desired in they came together again  But I should say that his withdrawing with a very serious Aspect made me afraid I had gone too far And I said before they came in What  shall  I do if I have incurred Mr  B  's Anger by my Overforwardness Did he not look displeas'd Dear my Ladies if he be so plead for me and I will withdraw when he comes in for I cannot stand his Anger I have not been used to it  Never fear you charming  Pamela  said my Lady he can't be angry at any thing you say or do But I wish for the sake of what I have been Witness to of Mr  Adams  's Behaviour and Modesty that such a thing could be done for him  Mr  Adams  bow'd and said Oh my good Ladies 'tis too too considerable a thingI cannot expect itI do notIt would be Presumption if I did  Just then reenter'd Mr  B  and Mr  Williams  the first with a stately Air the other with a more Peaceportending Smile on his Countenance  But Mr  B  sitting down Well  Pamela  said he very gravely I see that Power is a dangerous thing in any Hand Sir Sir said I My dear Lady whispering to Lady  Davers  I will withdraw as I said I would And I was getting away as fast as I could But he arose and coming up to me took my Hand Why is my Charmer so soon frighten'd said he most kindly and still more kindly with a noble Air pressed it to his Lips I must not carry my Jest too far upon a Mind so apprehensive as I otherwise might be inclined to do And leading me to Mr  Adams  and Mr  Williams  he said taking Mr  Williams  's Hand with his Left as he held mine in his Right Your worthy Brother Clergyman Mr  Adams  gives me Leave to confirm the Decision of my dear Spouse and you are to thank her for the Living of  F  upon the Condition she proposed and may you give but as much Satisfaction there as you have done in this Family and as Mr  Williams  has given to his Flock and they will then after a while be pleas'd as much with your Ministry as they have hitherto been with his  Mr  Adams  trembled with Joy and begg'd Leave to withdraw I cannot I cannot said he bear bear this Excess of Goodness And he retir'd with an Air of Gratitude and Transport in his Countenance which Words cannot equally express  This affected me a good deal as it did all the Company but I was still more affected when Mr  B  said Here my Dear thank good Mr  Williams  for inabling you to give such a shining Proof of your Excellence And remember that whenever I put any Power into your Hands for the future you keep this happy Instance in Mind and in every thing that offers I shall then have no Will nor Choice but yours  Could I avoid my dear Miss being thus nobly more than generously what shall I do for a Word to express my Sense of his Graciousness to me Could I avoid I say doing a weak thing without regarding the Presence I was in I fell on my Knees to him and kissed his dear Hand How shall I how shall I said I oppressed with your hourly Goodness find Words But Oh forgive me Meanings croud so thick upon me that my Words patting my Bosom with my other Hand stick here just hereand I cannot  And indeed I could say no more and he in the Delicacy of his Apprehensiveness for me clasped his kind Arms about me and withdrew with me into the next Parlour and placed himself by me on the Settee putting my Face on his generous Breast and said Take care take care my best Beloved that the Joy which overflows your dear Heart for having done a beneficent and a noble Action to a deserving Gentleman does not affect you too much You have no BODY just now my dear Life added he your SPIRIT has absorb'd it all But you  must  descend or what will become of me And take care you don't do it too precipitately for a Circumstance so delicate and so delightful to me  My Lady  Davers  followed us Where is my Angel Sister where is my noble Brother said she Rest her dear Head on my Bosom for I have a Share in her next to yourself and return to a Company where you'll not find a dry Eye nor an opening Lip but looking upon one another in speechless Rapture at the exalted Scene you have exhibited between you  My dear Mr  B  delighted with every Occasion that makes for my Honour and to endear me to his beloved Sister said Take care then of my Jewel and let her dear Face adorn the Bosom of a Lady I  love next to herself And rising went into the great Parlour  I would have stood up but quite abashed at my recollected Behaviour before so many Witnesses and confounded with the Goodness of such a Brother and such a Sister my Feet were unwilling to support me And my dear Lady  Davers  O Miss what a happy  Pamela  is your Friend what a happy Daughter my dear Father and Mother clasped me in her Arms and to her Bosom and kissed me five or six times running over with Expressions of Favour and Goodness in a Style and Words I cannot repeat For she is Mistress of a flowery Rhetorick and has such a charming Gift of Utterance that could I but half equal her when she thus loftily soars I should deserve the Compliments she made me  Coffee being ready Lady  Davers  led me to the great withdrawing Room and we were join'd by all the Company and Mr  Adams  too and my Lord  Davers  was pleased to make me several fine Compliments and so did Mr  H  after his Manner But the Countess exceeded  herself  in Goodness  Mr  Williams  seemed so pleased and so elated with the deserved Acceptation his worthy Conduct had met with that it shew'd he was far from repenting at the generous Turn the Matter had taken in favour of Mr  Adams  On the contrary he congratulated him upon it telling him he would introduce him when his generous Patron thought proper to his new Parishioners and would read Prayers for him at his first Preaching And I think Mr  Adams  said he since this happy Affair has been brought about from the Conversation upon Dispensations you and I both by our Examples and our Arguments must on all Occasions discredit that Practice since as my Lady has observed God's Providence is a better Reliance than the richest Benefice in  England  and  since as her Ladyship has also observed we ought not to look beyond a happy Competency as if in  this Life only we had Hope    My Lady said Mr  Adams  has given me many Lessons relating to different Parts of my Duty both as a Christian and a Clergyman that will not only furnish me with Rules for my future Conduct but with Subjects for the best Sermons I shall ever be able to compose  Mr  B  was pleased to say It is a Rule with me not to leave till Tomorrow what can be done Today And when my Dear do you propose to dispense with Mr  Adams  's good Offices in your Family Or did you intend to induce him to go to Town with us  I had not proposed any thing Sir as to that for I had not asked your kind Direction But the good Dean will supply us I doubt not and when we set out for  London  Mr  Adams  will be at full Liberty with his worthy Friend Mr  Williams  to pursue the happy Scheme which your Goodness has permited to take Effect  Mr  Adams  my Dear who came last from the University can perhaps recommend such another young Gentleman as himself for your Domestick Duties  I looked it seems a little grave and Mr  B  said What have you to offer  Pamela  What have I said amiss  Amiss dear Sir  Ay and dear Madam too I see by your bashful Seriousness in place of that smiling Approbation which you always shew when I utter any thing you  intirely  approve that I have said something which would rather meet with your Acquiescence than Choice So as I have often told you none of your Reserves And never  hesitate  to me your Consent  in any thing while you are sure I will conform to your Wishes or pursue my own Liking as  either  shall appear reasonable to me when I have heard  your  Reasons  Why then dear Sir what I had presumed to think but I submit it to your better Judgment was Whether as the Gentleman who is so kind as to direct our Family Duties in some measure acts in the Province of the worthy Dean it were not right that our own Parish Minister whether here or at  London  should name or at least approve  our  naming the Gentleman  Why could not I have thought of that as well as you Saucebox Lady  Davers  I'm intirely on your Side I think she deserves a Slap now for us both  I'll forgive her said my Lady since I find her Sentiments and Actions as much a Reproach to others as to me  Mr  Williams  did you ever think said Mr  B  it would have come to this Did you ever know such a saucy Girl in your Life Already to give herself these reproaching Airs  No never if your Honour is pleased to call the most excellent Lady in the World by such a Name nor any body else  Pamela  I charge you said the dear Gentleman if you  study  for it be sometimes in the Wrong that one may not always be taking Lessons from such an Assurance but in our Turns have something to teach  you    Then dear Sir said I must I not be a strange Creature For how when you and my good Ladies are continually giving me such charming Examples can I do a wrong thing  Mr  H  said Let him  be hang'd  if he would not marry as soon as ever he could get any body to have him  Foolish Fellow said Lady  Davers  do'st think that thou'lt meet with such a Wife as that when thou marryest  Why not MadamFor if I am not so good as Mr  B  now is I have not been so bad neither as he was formerly Excuse me Sir And so I may stand a Chance  A Chance said my Ladythat's like thee Didst ever hear of such an one as she  I never said he and fell a Laughing  saw  such an one I own And take  that  my good Lady for calling me  Foolish Fellow    There's not the Reproach in thy Answer that thou intendest except to thy own grinning Insolence said her Ladyship severe enough but smiling that makes thee think  that  a Reflection that is none in this Case  Egad Madam you're always hard upon me I can say nothing to please you While every body else gives and receives Compliments I can come in for nothing but  Foolish Fellow  with your Ladyship▪  Nephew said my Lord laughing I think you come in for a large Part and a facetious one too For when you're present and Conversation takes a serious Turn you make an excellent Character to set us all a laughing  He got up and bow'd very low I thank your Lordship You might as well have called me a Jackpudden in plain Words but then I would have looked upon you all as so many Mountebanks There I have you said he and fell a laughing  The Countess shuddering said Dear dear Mr  H  be silent I beseech you whenever we are serious For you tear one from the Feast of Souls to the Froth of BodiesWas not that a fine Rebuke Miss Is not this a charming Lady  I hope Miss you will forgive me for being so tedious on the aforegoing Subject and its most agreeable Conclusion It is an important one because several Persons as Conferrers or Receivers have found their Pleasure and Account in it and it would be well if Conversation were often attended with like happy Consequences I have one Merit to plead in behalf even of my Prolixity that in the delightful Conferences I have the Pleasure of holding with our noble Guests and Mr  B  altho' several which I omit may be more worthy of Recital than those I give yet am I careful not to write twice upon one Topick so that you have as much Variety from me as the Nature of the Facts and Cases will admit of  But here I will conclude having a very different Subject as a Proof of what I have advanc'd to touch in my next Till when I am  Your most affectionate and faithful  P B  LETTER XXXI  My dear Miss  I Now proceed with my Journal which I brought down to  Tuesday  Evening and of course I begin with  WEDNESDAY  Towards the Evening came Sir  Jacob Swynford  on Horseback attended by two Servants in Liveries I was abroad for I had got Leave for a whole Afternoon attended by my  Polly  which Time I passed in visiting no less than four several poor sick Families whose Hearts I made glad But I should be too tedious were I to give you the Particulars and besides I have a brief List of Cases which when  you'll favour me with your Company I may shew you for I have obliged myself  See  Vol II  p    tho' not desired to keep an Account of what I do with no less than  l  a Year that my dear Mr  B  allows me to expend in Acts of Charity and Benevolence  Lady  Davers  told me afterwards that Sir  Jacob  carried it mighty stiff and formal when he alighted He strutted about the Courtyard in his Boots with his Whip in his Hand and tho' her Ladyship went to the great Door in order to welcome him he turn'd short and whistling followed the Groom into the Stable as if he had been at an Inn only instead of taking off his Hat pulling its broad Brim over his Eyes for a Compliment In she went in a Pet as she says saying to the Countess A surly Brute he always was  My  Uncle He's more of an Hostler than a Gentleman I'm resolv'd I'll not stir to meet him again And yet the Wretch loves Respect from others tho' he never practises common Civility himself  The Countess said She was glad he was come for she lov'd to divert herself with such odd Characters nowandthen  And now let me give you a short Description of him as I found him when I came in that you may the better conceive what sort of a Gentleman he is  He is about Sixtyfive Years of Age a coarse strong bigbon'd Gentleman with large irregular Features he has a haughty supercilious Look a swaggering Gait and a Person not at all bespeaking one's Favour in behalf of his Mind and his Mind as you shall hear byandby not clearing up those Prepossessions in his Disfavour with which his Person and Features at first impress one His Voice is big and surly his Eyes little and fiery his Mouth large  with what Teeth he has left ground down as it seem'd even with his manycolour'd Gums as if by constant Use But with all these Imperfections he has an Air that sets him somewhat above the mere Vulgar and such as makes one think that half his Disadvantages are rather owing to his own haughty Humour than to Nature For he seems to be a perfect Tyrant at first Sight a Man used to prescribe and not to be prescribed to and has the Advantage of a shrewd penetrating Look which yet methinks seems rather acquired than natural  After he had seen his Horses well serv'd and put on an oldfashion'd Goldbutton'd Coat which by its Freshness shew'd he had been very chary of it a better Wig but in stiff Buckle and a long Sword stuck stiffly as if thro' his Coat Lappets in he came and with an imperious Air entering the Parlour What nobody come to meet me said he and saluting her Ladyship How do you do Niece and look'd about haughtily she says as if he expected to see me  My Lady presenting the Countess said The Countess of  C  Sir  Jacob  O cry Mercy said he Your most obedient humble Servant Madam I hope his Lordship is well  At your Service Sir  Jacob    I wish he was said he bluntly he should not have voted as he did last Sessions I can tell you that  Why Sir  Jacob  said she  Servants  don't always in this free Kingdom do as their  Masters  would have 'em  Mine  do I can tell you that Madam  Right or Wrong Sir  Jacob  It can't be wrong if I command them  Why truly Sir  Jacob  there's many a private Gentleman carries it higher to a Servant than he  cares his  Prince  should to him But I thought till now 'twas the King only could do no wrong  But Madam I always take care to be right  A good Reasonbecause I dare say you never think you  can  be in the wrong  Your Ladyship should spare me I'm but just come off a Journey Let me turn myself about and I'll be up with you never fear Madam But where's my Nephew Lady  Davers  And where's your Lord I was told you were all here and young  H  too upon a very extraordinary Occasion so I was willing to see how Causes went among you and what you were about It will be long enough before you come to see me  My Brother and Lord  Davers  and Mr  H  are all rid out together  Well Niece strutting with his Hands behind him and his Head held up▪HaHe has made a fine Kettle on'than't he'Sblood that was his profligate Word that ever such a Rake should be so caughtThey tell me she's plaguy cunning and quite smart and handsomeBut I wish his Father were but livingYet what could he have done He was always unmanageable But I wish he'd been my Son by my Faith I do What I hope Niece he locks up his Baby while you're here You don't keep her Company do you  Yes Sir  Jacob  reply'd my Lady I do and you'll not scruple to do so too when you see her  Why thou countenancest him in his Folly Child I'd a better Opinion of thy Spirit Thou married to a Lord and thy Brother to aCanst tell me what  Barbara  If thou canst pr'ythee do  To an Angel and so you'll say when you see her  What dost think I shall look thro'  his  foolish EyesWhat a Disgrace to a Family ancienter than the ConquestO  Tempora  O  Mores  What will this World come to  The Countess was diverted with this odd Gentleman but run on in my Praise for fear he should say some rude things to me when I came in and Lady  Davers  seconded her But all it seems signify'd nothing He would tell us both his Mind let the young Whelp that was his Word take it as he would And pray said he can't I see this fine Body before he comes in Let me but turn her round two of three times and ask her a Question or two and by her Answers I shall know what to think of her in a Twinkling  She is gone to take a little Airing Sir  Jacob  and won't be back till Suppertime  Suppertime Why she is not to sit down at Table is she If she does I won't that's positive But now you talk of Supper what have you I must have a boil'd Chicken and shall eat it all myself Who's Housekeeper now I suppose all's turn'd upside down  No there is not one new Servant except a Girl that waits upon her own Person All the old Servants are continued  That's much these Creatures generally take as great State upon 'em as a born Lady And they're in the right If they can make the Man stoop to the great Point they'll hold his Nose to the Grindstone never fear and all the little ones come about in course  Well Sir  Jacob  when you see her you'll alter your Mind  Never never that's positive  Ay Sir  Jacob  I was as positive as you once but I love her now as well as if she was my own Sister  O hideous hideousTell it not in  Gath  for thou'lt make the Daughters of  Philistia  triumph All the Fools that he has made whereever he has travelled will clap their Hands at him and at you too if you  talk at this RateBut let me speak to Mrs  Jervis  if she be here I'll order my own Supper  So he went out saying He knew the House tho' in a better Mistress's Days  The Countess said If Mr  B  kept his Temper as she hoped he would there would be good Diversion with the old Gentleman  O yes said my Lady my Brother will I dare say He despises this surly Brute too much to be angry at him let him say what he will  He went and talked a great deal against me to Mrs  Jervis  You may guess Miss that she launched out in my Praises and he was offended at her and said Woman Woman forbear these illtim'd Praises Her Birth's a Disgrace to our Family What my Sister's Waitingmaid taken upon Charity I cannot bear it  I mention all these things as the Ladies afterwards told them to me because it shall prepare you to judge what a fine Time I was likely to have of it  When Mr  B  and my Lord  Davers  and Mr  H  came home which they did about half an Hour after Six they were told who was there just as they entered the Parlour and Mr  B  smiled at Lord  Davers  and enteringSir  Jacob  said he Welcome to  Bedfordshire  And thrice Welcome to this House I rejoice to see you  My Lady says Never was so odd a Figure as the old Baronet made when thus accosted He stood up indeed but as Mr  B  offer'd to take his Hand he put 'em both behind himNot that you know of SirAnd then looking up at his Face and down at his Feet three or four times successively Are you my Brother's Son That very individual Son that your good Father used to boast of and say that for handsome Person true Courage noble Mind  was not to be matched in any three Counties in  England  The very same dear Sir that my honoured Father's Partiality used to think he never praised enough  And what is all of it come to at last He paid well did he not to teach you to Know the WorldAd's Life Nephew hadst thou been a born Fool or a raw Greenhead or a doating Greyhead  What then Sir  Jacob  What thenWhy then thou wouldst have done just as thou hast done  Come come Sir  Jacob  you know not my Inducements You know not what an Angel I have in Person and Mind Your Eyes shall byandby be blest with the Sight of her Your Ears with hearing her speakAnd then you'll call all you have said Profanation  What is it I hear What is it I hearYou talk in the Language of Romance and from the Housekeeper to the Head of the House you're all starkstaring mad By my Soul Nephew I wish for thy own Credit thou wertBut what signifies WishingI hope you'll not bring your Syren into my Company  Yes I will Sir because I love to give you Pleasure And say not a Word more for your own sake till you see herYou'll have the less to unsay Sir  Jacob  ▪ and the less to repent of  The DevilI'm in an inchanted Castle that's certain What a Plague has this little Witch done to you allAnd how did she bring it about  The Ladies and Lord  Davers  laugh'd it seems and Mr  B  begging him to sit down and answer him some Family Questions he said for it seems he is very captious at times What a Devil am I to be  laugh'd at Lord  Davers  I hope  you're  not bewitch'd too are you  Indeed Sir  Jacob  I am My Sister  B  is my Doatingpiece  Whew whistled he with a wild Stare And how is it with  you  Youngster  With me Sir  Jacob  said Mr  H  I'd give all I'm worth in the World and ever shall be worth for such another Wife  He ran to the Window and throwing up the Sash looking into the Courtyard said Hollo Soho Groom  JackJonas  Get me my Horse I'll keep no such CompanyI'll be gone Why  Jonas  calling again  You're not in Earnest Sir  Jacob  said Mr  B  I am by my SoulI'll away to the Village this Night Why you're all upon the HighGame I'llBut who comes here For just at that Instant the Chariot brought me into the Courtyard Who's this Who is she  One of  my  Daughters started up the Countess my youngest Daughter  Jenny  She's the Pride of my Family Sir  Jacob  By my Soul said he I was running for I thought it was the grand Inchantress  Out stept Lady  Davers  to me Dear  Pamela  said she humour all that's said to you Here's Sir  Jacob  come You're the Countess of  C  's youngest Daughter  Jenny  That's your Cue  Ah but Madam said I Lady  Jenny  is not marry'dlooking before I thought on a Circumstance that I think too much of sometimes tho' I carry it off as well as I can  She laugh'd at my Exception Come Lady  Jenny  said she for I just then enter'd the great Door I hope you've had a fine Airing  A very pretty one Madam said I as I enter'd the Parlour This is a pleasant Country Lady  Davers Wink when I'm wrong whisper'd I  Where's Mrs  B  Then as seeing a strange Gentleman I started half back into a more reserv'd Air and made him a low Court'sy  Sir  Jacob  look'd as if he did not know what to think of it now at me now at Mr  B  But the dear Gentleman put him quite out of Doubt by taking my Hand Well Lady  Jenny  did you meet my Fugitive in your Tour  No Mr  B  said I Did she go my Way I told you I would keep the great Road  Lady  Jenny C  said Mr  B  presenting me to his Uncle A charming Creature added the dear Gentleman Have you never a Son worthy of such an Alliance  Ay marry Nephew this is a Lady indeed Why the Plague whisper'd he could you not have pitch'd your Tent hereMiss by your Leave And saluting me turn'd to the Countess By my Soul Madam you've a charming Daughter Had my rash Nephew seen this lovely Creature and you'd have condescended he'd never have stoop'd to the Cottage as he has done  You're right Sir  Jacob  return'd Mr  B  but I always ran too fast for my Fortune Yet these Ladies of Family never bring out their Jewels into Batchelors Company and when too late we see what we've miss'd we are vex'd at our Precipitation  Well said however Boy By my Soul I wish thee Repentance tho' 'tis out of thy Power to amend Be that one of thy Curses when thou seest this Lady as I make no doubt it is  Again taking my Hand and surveying me from Head to Foot and turning me round which it  seems is a mighty Practice with him to a StrangerLady and a modest one too you'll say Miss Why truly you're a charming Creature Miss Lady  Jenny  I would sayBy your Leave once moreUpon my Soul my Lady Countess she is a CharmerButButstaring at me Are you marry'd Madam  I look'd a little silly and my new Mamma came up to me and took my Hand Why  Jenny  you are dress'd oddly to DayWhat a Hoop you wear It makes you look I can't tell how  Upon my Soul Madam I thought so what signifies LyingBut 'tis only the Hoop I see Really and truly Lady  Jenny  your Hoop is enough to make half an hundred of our Sex despair for fear you should be marry'd I thought it was something Few Ladies escape my Notice I always kept a good Lookout for I have two Daughters of my own But 'tis the Hoop I see plainly enough You are so slender every where but  here  putting his Hand upon my Hip which quite dash'd me and I retir'd behind my Lady Countess's Chair  Fie Sir  Jacob  said Mr  B  before us young Gentlemen to take such Liberties with a Maiden Lady You give a bad Example  Hang him that sets you a bad Example Nephew But I see you're right I see Lady  Jenny  's a Maiden Lady or she would not have been so shamefac'd I'll swear for her on Occasion Ha ha haI'm sure repeated he she's a MaidenFor our Sex give the married Ladies a freer Air in a Trice  How Sir  Jacob  said Lady  Davers    O fie said the CountessCan't you praise the Maiden Ladies but at the Expence of the marry'd ones What do you see of Freedom in me  Or in me said Lady  Davers    Nay for that Matter you are very well Ladies I must needs sayBut will you pretend to blush with that Virgin RoseWill ye Od's my Life MissLady  Jenny  I would say taking my Hand come from behind your Mamma's Chair and you two Ladies stand up now togetherThere so you doWhy now Blush for Blush and Lady  Jenny  shall be three to one and a deeper Crimson by half Look you there look you there else An hundred Guineas to one against the FieldThen stamping with one Foot and lifting up his Hands and Eyes O Christ Lady  Jenny  has it all to nothingBy my Soul she hasHa ha haYou may well sit down both of you but you're a Blush too late I can tell ye thatWell hast thou done Lady  Jenny    I was hastening away and he said But let's see you again Miss for now I will stay if they bring nobody elseAnd away I went for I never was more out of Countenance What a strange Creature thought I is this  Supper being near ready he continued calling out for Lady  Jenny  for he said the Sight of her did him good But he was resolv'd he would not sit down at Table with  somebody else    The Countess said She would fetch her Daughter and stepping out return'd saying Mrs  B  understands that Sir  Jacob  is here and that he does not chuse to see her so she begs to be excus'd and my  Jenny  and she desire to sup together  The very worst Tidings I have heard this Twelvemonth Why Nephew let your Girl sup with any body so we may have Lady  Jenny  back with us  I know said the Countess who was desirous to see how far he would carry it  Jenny  won't leave Mrs  B  so if you see  one  you must see  t'other    Nay then if it must be so I must sit down contentedBut yet I should be glad to see Lady  Jenny    that I should But I will not sit down at Table with Mr  B  's Girlthat's positive  Well well let 'em sup together and there's an End of it said Mr  B  I see my Uncle has as good a Judgment as any body of fine Ladies  That I have Nephew  But he can't forego his Humour in Compliment to the finest Lady in  England    Consider Nephew consider'Tis not thy doing a foolish Thing and calling a Girl Wife shall cram a Niece down my Throat that's positive The Moment thy Girl comes down to take place of these Ladies I am gone that's most certain  Well then shall I go up and oblige  Pamela  to sup by herself and persuade Lady  Jenny  to come down to us  With all my Soul NephewA good Motion But  Pamela  did you sayA queer sort of Name I've heard of it somewhere Is it a Christian or a Pagan NameLinseywolseyhalf one half t'other like thy GirlHa ha ha  Let me be  hang'd  whisper'd Mr  H  to his Aunt if Sir  Jacob  has not a Power of Wit tho' he's so whimsical with it I like him much  But hark ye Nephew said Sir  Jacob  as Mr  B  was going out of the Parlourone Word with you Don't fob upon us your Girl with the Pagan Name for Lady  Jenny  I have set a Mark upon her and should know her from a Thousand altho' she had chang'd her HoopThen he laugh'd again and said He hoped Lady  Jenny  would comeAnd come without any body with herBut I smell a Plot said heBy my Soul I won't stay if they both come together I won't be put upon But here comes one or bothWhere's my WhipI'll go  Indeed Mr  B  I had rather have staid with Mrs  B  said I as I enter'das he had bid me  'Tis she 'tis sheYou've no body behind you No she han'tWhy now Nephew you're right I was afraid you'd have put a Trick upon me You'd  rather  repeated he have stay'd with Mrs  B  Yes I warrantBut you shall be plac'd in better Company my dear Child  Sister said Mr  B  will you be pleased to take that Chair for  Pamela  does not chuse to give my Uncle Disgust who so seldom comes to see us  My Lady took the upper End of the Table and I sat next below my new Mamma So  Jenny  said she How have you left Mrs  B  A little concern'd said IBut she was the easier as Mr  B  himself desir'd I'd come down  My Lord  Davers  sat next me and Sir  Jacob  said Shall I beg a Favour of you my Lord to let me sit next to Lady  Jenny  Mr  B  said Won't it be better to sit overagainst her Uncle  Ay that's right I'faith Nephew thou know'st what's right Well so I willHe accordingly removed his Seat and I was very glad of it for tho' I was sure to be star'd at sufficiently by him yet I was afraid if he sat next me he would not keep his Hands off my Hoop  He run on a deal in my Praises after his manner but so rough at times that he gave me Pain  After Supper the Gentlemen sat down to their Bottle and the Ladies and I withdrew and about Twelve they broke up Sir  Jacob  talking of nothing but Lady  Jenny  and wishing Mr  B  had marry'd so happily as with such a charming Creature One he said that carried Tokens of her high Birth in her Face and whose every Feature and Look shew'd her nobly descended  They let him go to Bed with his Mistake But the Countess said next Morning She thought she never  saw a greater Instance of stupid Pride and Churlishness and she should be sick of the Advantage of Birth or Ancestry if this was the natural Fruit of it For a Man said her Ladyship to come to his Nephew's House and to suffer the Mistress of it as he thinks to be closetted up and not permitted to appear in order to humour his absurd and brutal Insolence and to behave as he has done is such a Ridicule upon the Pride of Descent that I shall think of it as long as I live O Mrs  B  said she what Advantages have you over every one that sees you but most over those who pretend to treat you unworthily  I expect to be called to Breakfast every Minute and shall then perhaps see how this Matter will end I wish when it is revealed he is not in a Fury and think himself imposed on I fear it won't end so well as I wish for every body seems to be grave and angry at Sir  Jacob    THURSDAY  I Now proceed with my Tale At Breakfasttime when every one was sat and a Chair left for me Sir  Jacob  began to call out for Lady  Jenny  But said he I'll have none of your Girl Nephew altho' the Chair at the TeaTable is left for somebody No said Mr  B  we'll get Lady  Jenny  to supply Mrs  B  's Place as you don't care to see her  With all my Heart reply'd he  But Uncle said Mr  B  Have you really no Desire no Curiosity to see the Girl I have marry'd No none at all by my Soul  Just then I came in and paying my Compliments to the Company and to Sir  Jacob  Shall I said I  supply Mrs  B  's Place in her Absence And down I sat  After Breakfast and the Servants were withdrawn Lady  Jenny  said Lady  Davers  you are a young Lady who have all the Advantages of Birth and Descent and some of the best Blood in the Kingdom runs in your Veins and here Sir  Jacob Swynford  is your great Admirer Cannot  you  from whom it will come with a double Grace convince him that he does an unkind thing at my Brother's House to keep the Person my Brother has thought worthy of making the Mistress of it out of Company And let us know your Opinion Whether my Brother himself does right to comply with such an unreasonable Distaste  Why how now Lady  Davers  This from you I did not expect it  My Uncle said Mr  B  is the only Person in the Kingdom that I would have humoured thus And I made no doubt when he saw how willing I was to oblige him in so high a Point he would have acted a more generous Part than he has yet done But Lady  Jenny  what say you to my Sister's Questions  If I must speak my Mind reply'd I I should take the Liberty to be very serious with Sir  Jacob  and to say That when a thing is done and cannot be help'd he should take care how he sows the Seeds of Indifference and Animosity between Man and Wife And how he makes a Gentleman dissatisfy'd with his Choice and perhaps unhappy as long as he lives  Nay Miss said he if all are against me and you whose good Opinion I value more than all you may e'en let the Girl come and sit down if you will If she is but half as pretty and half as wise and modest as you I shall▪ as it cannot be help'd as you say be ready to think better of the Matter For 'tis a little hard I must needs say if she has hitherto  appear'd before all the good Company to have her kept out of the way on my Account  Really Sir  Jacob  said the Countess I have blush'd for you more than once on this Occasion But the Mistress of this House is more than half as wise and modest and lovely And in hopes you will return me back some of the Blushes I have lent you see  there  in my Daughter  Jenny  whom you have been so justly admiring the Mistress of the House and the Lady with the Pagan Name  Sir  Jacob  sat aghast looking at one and at another and at me each in Turn and then cast his Eyes on the FloorAt last up he got and swore a sad Oath And am I thus trick'd and bamboozled that was his Word am IThere's no bearing this House nor her Presence now that's certain and I'll be gone  Mr  B  looking at me and nodding his Head towards Sir  Jacob  as he was in a Flutter to be gone I arose from my Chair and went to him and took his Hand I hope Sir  Jacob  you will be able to bear  both  when you shall see that there is no other Difference but that of Descent between the supposed Lady  Jenny  whom you so kindly praised and the Girl your dear Nephew has so much exalted  Let me go said he I'm most confoundedly bit I cannot look you in the Face By my Soul I cannotFor 'tis impossible you should forgive me  Indeed it is not Sir you have done nothing but what I can forgive you for if your dear Nephew can for to him was the Wrong if any and I'm sure he can overlook itAnd for his sake to the Uncle of so honoured a Gentleman to the Brother of my late good Lady I can with a bent Knee  thus  ask your Blessing and desire your Excuse for joining to keep you in this Suspense  Bless youO Christ said he and stamp'd Who can chuse but bless you And he kneeled down and wrapp'd his Arms about meBut curse me that was his strange Word if ever I was so touched before  My dear Mr  B  for fear my Spirits should be too much affected for the rough Baronet in his Transport had bent me down lower than I kneeled came to me and held me by my Arm but let Sir  Jacob  raise me only saying How does my Angel Now she has made this Conquest she has completed all her Triumphs  Angel did you call herBy my Soul I'm confounded with her Goodness and her sweet CarriageRise and let me see if I can stand myselfAnd believe me I am sorry I have acted so much like a Bear as I have done and the more I think of it the more I shall be asham'd of myself And the Tears as he spoke ran down his rough Cheeks which moved me a good deal for to see a Man with so rough and so hard a Countenance weep was a touching Sight  Mr  H  putting his Handkerchief to his Eyes his Aunt said What's the Matter  Jackey  The Matter answer'd he I don't know how the Dl 'tis But here's strange Doings as ever I knewFor here Day after Day one's ready to cry without knowing whether it be for Joy or SorrowWhat a Plague's the Matter with me I wonderAnd out he went the two Ladies whose charming Eyes too glisten'd with Pleasure smiling at the Effect the Scene had upon Mr  H  and at what he said  Well Madam said Sir  Jacob  approaching me for I had sat down but then stood upYou will forgive me and from my Heart I wish you Joy By my Soul I doand saluted meI could not have believed there had been such a Person breathing  I don't wonder at my Nephew's loving you And you call her Sister Lady  Davers  don't you If you do I'll own her for my Niece  Don't IYes I do said her Ladyship coming to me and am proud so to call her And this I tell you for  your  Comfort tho' to  my own  Shame that I used her worse than you have done before I knew her Excellence and have repented of it ever since  I bow'd to her Ladyshipand kissing her Hand My dearest Lady said I you have made me rich Amends since I am sure I may say  That it was good for me that I was afflicted  Why Nephew she has the Fear of God I perceive before her Eyes too I'm sure I've heard those Words They are somewhere in the Scripture I believeWhy who knows but she may be a means to save your SoulHay you know  Ay Sir  Jacob  said Mr  B  she'll be a means to save an hundred Souls and might go a great way to save yours if you were to live with her but one Month  Well but Nephew I hope  you  forgive me too for now I think of it I never knew you take any Matter so patiently in my Life  I knew said the dear Gentleman that every Extravagance you insisted upon was heightening my Charmer's Triumph and increasing your own Contrition and as I was not  indeed  depriv'd of her Company I could bear with every thing you said or did Yet don't you remember that I caution'd you that the less you said against her the less you'd have to unsay and the less to repent of  I do and let me ride out and call myself to Account for all I said against her in her own Hearing and when I can think of but one half and how she has taken it by my Soul I believe 'twill make me more than half mad  At Dinner when we had Mr  Williams  's Company the Baronet told me he admir'd me now as much as he did when he thought me Lady  Jenny  but complain'd of the Trick put upon him by us all and seem'd nowandthen a little serious upon it  He took great Notice of the Dexterity which he imputed to me in performing the Honours of the Table And every nowandthen he lifted up his Eyes God take me Very clever by my Soul Why Madam you seem to me to be born to these ThingsI will be help'd by nobody but youAnd you'll have a Task of it I can tell you for I have a whipping Stomach and were there fifty Dishes I always taste of every one And indeed  John  was in a manner wholly imploy'd in going to and fro between the Baronet and me for half an Hour together  He went from us afterwards to Mrs  Jervis  and made her answer him abundance of Questions about me and how all these Matters had come about as he phrased it and returning when we drank Coffee said I have been  confabbing  that was his Word with Mrs  Jervis  about you Niece By my Soul I never heard the like She tells me you can play on the Spinnet and sing too Will you let a body have a Tune or so My  Mab  can play pretty well and so can  Dolly  I'm a Judge of Musick and would fain hear you I said If he was a Judge I should be afraid to play before him but I would not be ask'd twice when we had taken our Coffee  Accordingly he repeating his Request I gave him a Tune and sung to it Od's my Life said he you do it purelyBut I see where it isMy Girls have got  my  Fingers And then he held both Hands out and a fine Pair of Paws shew'd hePlague on't they touch two Keys at once but those slender and nimble Fingers how they sweep along My Eye can't follow 'emWhewwhistled heThey are  here and there and everywhere at once Why Nephew I believe you've put another Trick upon me My Niece is certainly of Quality And Report has not done her JusticeOne more Tune one more SongBy my Faith your Voice goes sweetly to your Fingers 'SlifeI'll thresh my Jadesthat was his polite Phrase when I come home Lady  Davers  you know not the Money they have cost me to qualify them and here is a mere Baby to them outdoes 'em by a Bar's Length without any Expence at all bestow'd upon her Go over that againConfound me for a Puppy I lost it by my PratingAy there you have itThat's it by my Soul it is Oh that I could but dance as well as thou sing'st I'd give you a Saraband as old as I am  After Supper we fell into a Conversation of which I must give you some Account because it was upon a Topick that Mr  B  has been blam'd for in his marrying me and which has stuck by some of his Friends even after they have in Kindness to me acquitted him in every other respect and that is The Example that he has set to young Gentlemen of Family and Fortune to marry beneath them  It was begun by Sir  Jacob  who said I am in Love with my new Niece that I am But still one thing sticks with me in this Affair and that is What will become of Degree or Distinction if this Practice of Gentlemen marrying their Mothers Waitingmaids Excuse me Madam should come into Vogue Already young Ladies and young Gentlemen are too apt to be drawn away in this manner and to disgrace their Family We have too many Instances of this You'll forgive me both of you  That said Lady  Davers  is the only Thing I must needs say Sir  Jacob  has hit upon the Point that would make one wish this Example had not been set by a Gentleman of such an antient Family till  one comes to be acquainted with this dear Creature and then every body thinks it ought not to be otherwise than it is  Ay  Pamela  said Mr  B  what can you say to this Cannot you defend me from this Charge This is a Point that has been often objected to me Try for one of your pretty Arguments in my Behalf  Indeed Sir reply'd I looking down it becomes not me to say any thing to this  But indeed it does if you can And I beg you'll help me to some Excuse if you have any at Hand  Won't you Sir dispense with me on this Occasion Indeed I know not what to say Indeed I should not if I may judge for myself speak one  Word  to this SubjectFor it is my absolute Opinion that Degrees in general should be kept up altho' I must always deem the present Case an happy Exception to the Rule  Mr  B  looking as if he still expected I should say something Won't you Sir dispense with me repeated I Indeed I should not speak to this Point if I may be my own Judge  I always intend my Dear you shall judge for yourself and you know I seldom urge you farther when you use those Words But if you have any thing upon your Mind to say let's have it For your Arguments are always new and unborrow'd  I would then if I  must  Sir ask If there be not a Nation or if there has not been a Law in some Nation That whenever a young Gentleman be  his  Degree what it would has seduced a poor Creature be  her  Degree what it would obliges the Gentleman to marry that unhappy Person  I think there is such a Law in some Country I can't tell where said Sir  Jacob    And do you think Sir whether it be so or not that it is equitable it should be so  Yes by my Troth Tho' I must needs own if it were so in  England  many Men that I know would not have had the Wives they now have  You speak to your Knowlege I doubt not Sir  Jacob  said Mr  B  Why indeedWhy trulyI don't know but I do  All then said I that I would infer is Whether another Law would not be a still more just and equitable one that the Gentleman who is repuls'd from a Principle of Virtue and Honour should not be censur'd for marrying a Person he could  not  seduce And whether it is not more for both their Honours if he does inasmuch as it is nobler to reward a Virtue than to repair a Shame were that Shame to be repair'd by Matrimony which I take the Liberty to doubt But I beg Pardon you commanded me SirElse this Subject should not have found a Speaker to it in me  This is admirably saidBy my Soul it is said Sir  Jacob    But yet this comes not up to the Objection said Mr  B  The setting an Example to Waitingmaids to aspire and to young Gentlemen to descend And I will enter into the Subject myself and the rather because as I go along I will give Sir  Jacob  a faint Sketch of the Merit and Character of my  Pamela  of which he cannot be so well inform'd as he has been of the Disgrace which he imagin'd I had brought upon myself by marrying her  In order to this give me Leave to say That I think it necessary that as well those Persons who are afraid the Example should be taken as those who are inclin'd to follow it should take  all  the material Parts of it into their Consideration Otherwise I think the Precedent may be justly cleared and the Fears of the one be judged groundless and the Plea  of the other but a Pretence in order to cover a Folly into which they would have fallen whether they had this Example or not  For Instance In order to lay Claim to the Excuses which my Conduct if I may suppose it of Force enough to do either Good or Hurt will furnish it is necessary  That the Object of their Wish should be a Girl of exquisite Beauty and that not only in their own blinded and partial Judgments but in the Opinion of  every one  who sees her Friend or Foe in order to justify the Force that the  first  Attractions have upon him  That she be descended of honest and conscientious tho' poor and obscure Parents who having preserved their Integrity thro' great Trials and Afflictions have by their Examples as well as Precepts laid deep in the Girl's Mind the Foundations of Piety and Virtue  It is necessary that to the Charms of Person this Waitingmaid should have an humble teachable Mind fine natural Parts a sprightly yet inoffesive Wit a Temper so excellent and a Judgment so solid as should promise for her by the Love and Esteem these Qualities should attract to herself from her Fellowservants superior and inferior that she would become an higher Station and be respected in it  It is necessary that after so good a Foundation laid by her Parents she should have all the Advantages of Female Education conferred upon her The Example of an excellent Lady improving and building upon so worthy a Foundation A Capacity surpriseingly ready to take in all that is taught her An Attention Assiduity and Diligence almost peculiar to herself at her Time of Life insomuch as at Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age to be able to vie with any  young Lady of Rank as well in the natural Genteelness of her Person as in her Acquirements And that in nothing but her  Humility  she should manifest any Difference between herself and the Highborn  It will be necessary moreover that she should have a Mind above Temptation that she should resist the  Offers  and  Menaces  of one upon whom all her worldly Happiness seemed to depend the Son of a Lady to whom she owed the greatest Obligations a Person whom she did not  hate  but greatly  feared  and whom her grateful Heart would have been  glad  to oblige and who sought to prevail over her Virtue by all the Inducements that could be thought of to  attract  a young unexperienced Virgin at one time or to  frighten  her at another into his Purposes who offer'd her high very high Terms her Circumstances consider'd as well for herself as for Parents she loved better than herself whose Circumstances at the same Time were low and distressful  That she should shew on requisite Occasions that she preferred her Virtue to her Life That if ever she should be cast wholly into the Power of one who she had too much Reason to think would stick at nothing to gain his Ends she should bear Persecution from his Agents withstand repeated Offers from himself tho' trying to influence her by Revenge when he could not move her other Passions Revenge the darling Passion of the Sex so seldom failing to answer a Tempter's Purpose be he Man or Devil that was his Expression in pretending to put her Persecutor in her Power And when she saw no visible Way to escape having been disappointed in an hundred pretty Machinations she had form'd young and unassisted as she was and threaten'd that if she yielded not to the high and alluring Terms he offered he would execute all his Purposes and she should not have one Advantage that  he then tender'd to her yet to be able to answer in such Words as these which will always dwell upon my Memory  "  See  Vol I  p    seqq  I reject your Proposals with all my Soul"    "May God desert me whenever I make worldly Grandeur my chiefest Good"    "I know I am in your Power I dread your Will to ruin me is as great as your Power' Yet will I dare to tell you I will make no Freewill Offering of my Virtue All that I  can  do poor as it is I  will  do to shew you that my Will bore no Part in my Violation"  And when future Marriage was intimated to her to induce her to yield to be able to answer  "The Moment I yield to your Proposals there is an End of all Merit if now I have any And I should be so far from  expecting  such an Honour that I will pronounce I should be most  unworthy  of it"  If I say my dear Friends such a Girl can be found thus beautifully attractive in  every one  's Eye and not partially so only in a young Gentleman's  own  and after that what good Persons would infinitely prefer to Beauty thus piously principled thus genteelly educated and accomplished thus brilliantly witty thus prudent modest generous undesigning and having been thus tempted thus try'd by the Man she hated not pursued not intriguingly pursuing be thus inflexibly virtuous and Proof against Temptation Let her reform her Libertine and let him marry her And were he of princely Extraction I dare answer for it that no  two  Princes in  one  Age take the World through would be in Danger For altho' I am sensible it is not to my Credit I will say that I never met with a Repulse nor a Conduct like this and yet I never sunk very low for the Subjects of my Attempts either at Home or Abroad  These are obvious Inferences added the dear Gentleman and not Refinements upon my  Pamela  's Story and if the Gentleman were capable of Thought and Comparison would rather make such an Example as is apprehended  more  than  less  difficult than  before    But if indeed added he the young Fellow be such a Booby that he cannot  reflect  and  compare  and take the Case with  all its Circumstances  together I think his good Papa or Mamma should get him a Wife to their own Liking as soon as possible and the poorest Girl in  England  who is honest would rather have Reason to bless herself for escaping such a Husband than to glory in the Catch she would have of him For such a young Fellow as that would hardly do Honour to his Family in any  one  Instance  Indeed said the Countess it would be pity after all that such an one should marry any Lady of Prudence and Birth for 'tis enough in Conscience that he is a Disgrace to  one  worthy Family it would be pity he should make  two  unhappy  Why really Nephew said Sir  Jacob  I think you have said a great deal to the Purpose There is not so much Danger from the Example as I apprehended from  sensible  and  reflecting  Minds I did not consider this Matter thoroughly I must needs say  All the Business is said Lady  Davers  You'll excuse me SisterThere will be more People will hear that Mr  B  has marry'd his Mother's Waitingmaid than will know his Inducements  Not many I believe Sister▪ For when 'tis known I have some Character in the World and am not quite an Idiot And my Faults in having not been one of the most virtuous of Men will stand me in some Stead in  this  Case tho' hardly in  any  other  they will naturally inquire into my Inducements  But see you not when we go Abroad to Church or elsewhere what Numbers of People her Character draws to admire the dear Creature Does not this shew that her Virtue has made her more conspicuous than my Fortune had made me For I pass'd up and down quietly enough before handsome as my Equipage always was and attracted not any body's Notice And indeed I had as lieve these Honours were not so publickly paid  her  for even were I  fond  of Shew and Parade what are they but a Reproach to meAnd can I have any Excellence but a secondary one in having after all my Persecutions of her done but common Justice to her Merit  This answers your Objection Lady  Davers  and shews that  my  Inducements and  her  Story must be equally known And upon my Conscience I think every thing I have said considered and every thing that might still farther be urged and the Conduct of that dear Creature in the Station she adorns so much exceeding all I hoped or could flatter myself with from the most promising Appearances that she does me more Honour than I have done her and if I am capable of putting myself in a third Person's Place I think I should be of the same Opinion were I to determine upon such another Pair exactly circumstanc'd as we are  You may believe Miss how much this generous Defence of the Step he had taken attributing every thing to me and depreciating his worthy Self affected me I play'd with a Cork now with my Rings another time turning them round my Fingers looked down and on one Side and every Way I looked but on the Company for they gazed too much upon me all the time so that I could only glance a tearful Eye nowandthen upon the dear Gentleman  and when it would overflow catch in my Handkerchief the escaped Fugitives that would start unbidden beyond their proper Limits tho' I often endeavoured by a twinkling Motion to disperse the gathering Water before it had formed itself into Drops too big to be restrained  All the Company praised the dear generous Speaker and he was pleased to say farther Altho' my good Friends I can truly say that with all the Pride of Family and the Insolence of Fortune which once made me doubt whether I should not sink too low if I made my  Pamela  my Mistress for I should then have treated her not ungenerously and should have suffered her perhaps to call herself by my Name I have never once repented of what I have done On the contrary I have always rejoiced in it and it has been from the first Day of our Marriage my Pride and my Boast and shall be let others say what they will that I can call such an Excellence and such a Purity which I so little deserve mine and I look down with Contempt upon the Rashness of all such as reflect upon me for they can have no Notion of my Happiness or her Merit  O dear Sir said I how do you overrate my poor MeritSome Persons are happy in a Life of  Comforts  but mine's a Life of  Joy  One rapturous Instance follows another so fast that I know not how to bear them  Whewwhistled Sir  Jacob  Whereabouts am II hope byandby you'll come down to our Pitch that one may put in a Word or two with you  May you be long thus blest and thus happy together said Lady  Davers  I know not which to admire most the dear Girl that never was bad or the dear Gentleman that having been bad is now so good  Said my Lord  Davers  There is hardly any bearing these moving Scenes so quick as my Sister says following one another  The Countess was pleased to say That till now she had been at a Loss to form any Notion of the Happiness of the first Pair before the Fall But now by so fine an Instance as this she comprehended it in all its ForceGod continue you to one another added her Ladyship for a Credit to the State and to Human Nature  Mr  H  having his Elbows on the Table folded his Hands shaking them and looking down upon the Table Egad this is uncommon Life that it is Your two Souls I can see that are like welltun'd Instruments But they are too highset for me a vast deal  The best thing said Lady  Davers  always severe upon her poor Nephew thou ever saidst The Musick must be equal to that of  Orpheus  which can make such a Savage as thee dance to it I charge thee say not another Word Tonight  Why indeed Aunt return'd he laughing I believe it  was  pretty well said for your foolish Fellow Tho' it was by Chance I must confess I did not think of it  That I believe reply'd my Ladyif thou hadst thou'dst not have spoken so well  Sir  Jacob  and Mr  B  afterwards fell into a Family Discourse and Sir  Jacob  gave us an Account of two or three Courtships  by  his three Sons and  to  his two Daughters and his Reasons for disallowing them And I could observe he is an absolute Tyrant in his Family tho' they are all Men and Women grown and he seem'd to please himself how much they stood in Awe of him  One odd Piece of Conversation I must tell you Miss because of the Inference that followed it  Sir  Jacob  asked Mr  B  If he did not remember  John Wilkins  his Steward He was an honest Fellow said he as ever liv'dBut he's dead Alas for him poor  Jack  He physicked himself out of his LifeHe would be always taking Slops Had I done so I should have gone to the Dogs long agoBut whom do you think Nephew I've got in his Place Nay you can't know him neither Why 'tis  Jerry Sherwood  a Boy I took upon Charity and taught to write and read or paid for't and that's the same thingHay you knowAnd now  Jerry  's a Gentleman's Fellow and is much respected by all our Hunters for he's a keen Sportsman I'll assure you I brought him up to that myself and many a Jirk has the Dog had from me before I could make any thing of him Many and many a good time have I whacked the Rascal's Jacket and he owes all he is and will be to me And I now suffer him to sit down at Table with me when I have no Guests  But is not this a bad Example said Mr  B  to promote so low a Servant to the Command of the Family under you What do  Gentlemen  say to this  Gentlemen say to itWhy what Gentlemen have any thing to do with my Family Management Surely I may do as I will in my own House and in my own Family or else it would be very hard  True Sir  Jacob  but People will be meddling where they have least Business But are not all the Gentlemen uneasy for fear their  lowest Servants  from the Example set by so leading a Man as you a Chairman of the Sessions a Colonel of Militia a Deputy Lieutenant and a Justice of Quorum should want to be made their  Stewards  Why I can't say that any body has taken it into their Heads to question me upon this Subject I should  think 'em plaguy impertinent if they had and bid them mind their own Business  But you'll allow Sir  Jacob  that every one who knows you have rais'd your Footboy to be your Steward will not know your  Inducements  altho' I doubt not they are very good ones  Lady  Davers  shook her Head at her Brother saying Very well Sir very well  Sir  Jacob  cry'd out O ho Nephew are you thereabouts with your Bears Why I can't say but you're  in  with me nowLet's see what have I said Ay by my Soul you have nabbed me cleverly Faith and Troth you have convinc'd me by an Example of my own that I was impertinent to trouble my Head about the Management of your FamilyTho' near Kindred makes some Excuse for me tooAnd besides a  Steward  and a  Wife  are two Things  So I'd have 'em be Sir  Jacob  But a good Wife is but a Steward to her Husband in many Cases and mine is the best that ever Gentleman had  Pretty expensive ones Nephew for all that as the World runsMost Gentlemen find I believe these Sort of Stewards run 'em out more than they save But that's not your Case I dare sayI'faith tho' you have nicked me cleverly that you have  But my witty Brother said my Lady I believe you'd better for all your Fling at me as to  Inducements  stick to your first Defence as to the Example sake for who stands upon Birth or Degree in the Office of a Steward  It will answer several Purposes Sister and come nearer the Point in what you object than you are aware of were we to dispute upon it But I have gain'd my End in the Observation Sir  Jacob  takes the Force of the Comparison and is convinced I dare say there is some Justice in it  Ay ay a great deal said Sir  Jacob  for a Wife is or ought to be her Husband's Steward I'm sure when mine was living I made her so and had no other for she made Memorandums and I digested them into Book and yet she brought me a noble Fortune too as you all know  Here I conclude my tedious NarrationsBe so good as to skim them over lightly that you may not think the worse of me and then return them to me with some of your charming Penmanship that I may send them on to  Kent  To be sure I would not have been so tediously trifling but for the Sake of my dear Parents And there is so much Selfpraise as it may seem from a Person repeating the fine Things said of herself that I am half of Opinion I should send them to  Kent  only and to think you should be obliged to me for saving you so much Trouble and Impertinence  Do dear Miss be so free as to forbid me to send you any more long Journals but common Letters only of How do you and Who and who's together and of Respects to one and to another and so forthLetters that one might dispatch as Sir  Jacob  says in a  Twinkling  and perhaps be more to the Purpose than the tedious Scrawl which kisses your Hands from  Dear Miss  Yours most sincerely  P B  Do dear good Sir  Simon  let Miss  Polly  add to our Delights by her charming Company Mr  Murray  and the new Affair will divert  you  in her Absence So pray as my good Lady  Darnford  has consented and Miss is willing and her Sister can spare her don't be so cross as to deny me  LETTER XXXIV From Miss  DARNFORD  to Mrs  B  My dear Mrs  B  I MUST recapitulate the Pleasure you have given us in your charming Accounts of your Conversations with your  London  Guests and the Verses put so boldly and wickedly under your Seat and your just Observations on the Lines and the Occasion But we all humbly request you'll be pleased to give us the Copy of the Manuscript Verses from which you transcribe the pretty Lines beginning  But Oh forgive me Heav'n if oft my Fair  I am quite shock'd when I think of Lady  Davers  's passionate Intentions at her first coming down to you to the Hall but have let nobody into the worst of the Matter in Compliance with your Desire We are delighted with your Account of Family Management and your  Sunday  's ServiceWhat an excellent Lady are you And how happy and how good you make every one who knows you is seen by the Ladies joining in your Evening Service as well as their Servants  We go on here swimmingly with our Courtship Never was there a fonder Couple than Mr  Murray  and Miss  Nancy  The moody Girl is quite alive easy and pleas'd except nowandthen with me We had a sad Fallingout t'other Day Thus it was  She had the Assurance on my saying they were so fond and so free beforehand that they would leave nothing for Improvement afterwards to tell me She had for some time perceived that my Envy was very disquieting to me This she said before Mr  Murray  who had the good Manners to retire seeing a Storm rising between us  Poor foolish Girl cry'd I when he was gone provok'd to great Contempt by her Expression before him Thou wilt make me despise thee in spite of my HeartBut pr'ythee manage thy Matters with common Decency at least  Good lack  Common Decency  I say  Common Decency  When my Sister  Polly  is able to shew me what it is I shall hope to be better for her Example  No thou'lt never be better for any body's Example Thy Illnature and Perverseness will keep thee from that as it has always hitherto done  My Illtemper you have often told me is  natural  to me so it must become me But upon such a sweettemper'd young Lady as Miss  Polly  it sits but ill  I must have had no bad Temper and that every one says to bear with thy sullen and perverse one as I have done all my Life  But why can't you bear with it a little longer SisterDoes any thing provoke you  now  with a sly Leer and affected Drawl that did not  formerly  Provoke meWhat should provoke meI gave thee but a Hint of thy fond Folly which makes thee behave so before Company that every one smiles at thee and I'd be glad to save thee from Contempt for thy  new  good Humour as I used to try to do for thy  old  bad Nature  Is that itWhat a kind Sister have IBut perhaps I see it vexes you and  illnatured  Folks love to teize you knowBut dear  Polly  don't let the Affection Mr  Murray  expresses for me put such a goodtemper'd Body out of Humour pray don't Who knows continued the Provoker who never says a tolerable thing that is not illnatur'd that being her Talent but the Gentleman may think himself happy that he has found a way with so much Ease to dispense with the Difficulty that Eldership laid  him underBut as he did you the Favour to let the Repulse come from you don't be angry Sister that he took you at the  first  Word  Indeed indeed said I with a contemptuous Smile thou'rt right  Nancy  to take the Gentleman at  his  first Word Hold him fast and play over all thy Monkey Airs with him with all my Heart Who knows but it may engage him more For should he leave thee I might be too much provok'd at thy Ingratitude to  turn over  another Gentleman to thee And let me tell you without such an Introduction thy Temper would keep any body from thee that knows it  Poor Miss  Polly  Come be as easy as you can Who knows but we may find out some Cousin or Friend of Mr  Murray  's between us that we may  persuade  to address you Don't make us your Enemies We'll try to make you easy if we can 'Tis a little hard that you should be so cruelly taken at your Word that it is  Dost think said I poor stupid illjudging  Nancy  that I can have the same Regret for parting with a Man I could not like that thou hadst when thy vain Hopes met with the Repulse they deserved from Mr  B  Mr  B  come up again I have not heard of Mr  B  a great while  No but it was necessary reply'd I that one Nail should drive out another for thou'dst been repining still had not Mr  Murray  been  turn'd over  to thee  Turn'd over  you us'd that Word once before Sister Such great Wits as you methinks should not use the same Word so often  How dost  thou  know what Wits  should  or should  not  do Thou hast no Talent but Illnature and 'tis enough for thee that one View takes up thy whole Thought Pursue thatBut I would only caution  thee that thou dost not  satiate  where thou wouldst  oblige  that's all Or if thy Man can be so gross as to like thy Fondness that thou leavest something for  Hereafter    I'll call him in again Sister and you shall acquaint us how you'd have it  Bell  for the Maid came in just then tell Mr  Murray  I desire him to walk in  I'm glad to see thee so teachable all at once I find out now what was the Cause of thy constant Perverseness For had the unavailing Lessons my Mamma was always inculcating upon thee come from a  Man  thou couldst have had Hopes of they had succeeded better  In came Sir  Simon  with his CrutchStickBut can you bear this Nonsense Mrs  B  What sparring jangling again you SlutsO what fiery Eyes on one side and contemptuous Looks on t'other  Why Papa my Sister  Polly  has  turn'd over  Mr  Murray  to me and she wants him back again and he won't comeThat's all the Matter  You know your Daughter  Nancy  PapaShe could never  bear  Reproof and yet would always  deserve  itI was only gently remarking for her Instruction on her Fondness before Company and she is as she  used to be  The poor Girl has not indeed been used to be courted and so knows not how to behave herself  So  Polly  because you have been able to run over a long List of humble Servants you must insult your Sister must youBut are you really concern'd  Polly  Hay  Sir this or any thing is very well from you But these Imputations of Envy before Mr  Murray  must make the Man very considerable with himself Poor  Nancy  don't consider thatBut indeed how should she How should  she  be able to reflect who knows not what Reflection is except of the spiteful  Sort But Papa should the poor Thing add to  his  Vanity which wants no Addition at the Expence of  her own  I saw her affected and was resolv'd to pursue my Advantage  Pr'ythee  Nancy  continu'd I canst thou not have a  little  Patience Child My Papa will set the Day as soon as he shall think it proper And don't let thy Man toil to keep Pace with thy Fondness for I have pity'd him many a time when I have seen him stretched on the Tenters to keep thee in Countenance  This set the illnatur'd Girl into Tears and Fretfulness all her old Temper came upon her as I design'd it should for she had kept me at Bay longer than usual and I left her under the Dominion of it and because I would not come into a fresh Dispute got my Mamma's Leave and the Chariot and went and begg'd a Dinner at Lady  Jones  's and then came home as cool and as easy as I us'd to be and found  Nancy  as sullen and silent as was her Custom before Mr  Murray  tendered himself to her ready Acceptance But I went to my Spinnet and suffer'd her to swell on  We have said nothing but No and Yes ever since And I wish I was with you for a Month and all their Nonsense over without me I am my dear obliging and excellent Mrs  B  Your faithful and affectionate  POLLY DARNFORD  The two following anticipating the Order of Time for the Reasons mentioned  p  we insert here  LETTER XXXV From Miss  DARNFORD  to Mrs  B  My dear Mrs  B  PRAY give my Service to your Mr  B  and tell him he is very unpolite in his Reflections  See this  Vol  p    upon me in relation to Mr  Murray  when he supposes I regret the Loss of him You are much more favourable and just too I will say to your  Polly Darnford  These Gentlemen the very best of them are such Indelicates They think so highly of their saucy Selves and confident Sex as if a Lady cannot from  her Heart  despise them But if she turns them off as they deserve and happens to continue her Dislike what should be interpreted in her Favour as a just and  regular  Piece of Conduct is turn'd against her and it must proceed from Spite  Mr  B  may think he knows a good deal of the Sex But perhaps were I as malicious as he is reflecting and yet if I have any Malice he has raised it I could say That his Acquaintance was not with the most unexceptionable till he had the Happiness to know you And he has not long enough been happy in you I find to do Justice to those who are proud to emulate your Virtues  But I can't bear  it seems  to see my Sister address'd and complimented and preferr'd by one whom I had thought in my own Power But he  may  be mistaken With all his Sagacity he  has been  often Nor is it so mortifying a thing to me as he imagines to sit and see two such Anticks playing  their Pugs Tricks as he calls them with one another  But you hardly ever saw  such  Pug's Tricks play'd as they play at so early a Time of Courtship The Girl hangs upon his Arm and receives his empty Head on her Shoulder already with a Freedom that would be censurable in a Bride before Folks A stiff sullen proud scornful Girl as she used to be she now puts on Airs that are not natural either to her Features or her Character and judge then how it must disgust one especially when one sees her Man so proud and vain upon it that like a true Man he treats her with the less Ceremony for her Condescensions putting on Airs of Consequence while her Easiness of Behaviour makes him secure of Acceptance and a kind Reception let him be as negligent or as forward as he pleases  I say Mrs  B  there can be no living with these Men upon such BeginningsThey ought to know their Distance or be taught it and not to think it in their Power to confer that as a Favour which they should think it an Honour to receive  But neither can I bear  it seems  the Preparatives to Matrimony the fine Cloaths the Compliments the busy Novelty as he calls it the new Equipages and so forth That's his Mistake again tell him For one who can look forwarder than the Nine Days of Wonder can easily despise so flashy and so transient a Glare And were I fond of Compliments it would not perhaps be the way to be pleased if I were to marry  Compliments in the single State are a Lady's Due whether courted or not and she receives them or ought always to receive them as such But in Courtship they are pour'd out upon one like a hasty Shower that one knows will soon be overA mighty comfortable Consideration this to a Lady  who  loves to be complimented  Instead of the refreshing  April  like Showers which beautify the Sunshine she shall stand a Deluge of Complaisance be wet to the Skin with it and thenWhat then Why be in a  Libyan  Desart ever after experience a constant parching Drought and all her fine Attributes will be swallow'd up in the Quicksands of Matrimony  It may be otherwise with you and it  must  be otherwise because there is such an infinite Variety in your Excellence Every rising Sun adorns you with some new Rays and sets not without leaving you brighter than he himself can hold itBut does Mr  B  think it must be so in  every  Matrimony  'Tis true he improves every Hour as I see in your kind Papers in his fine Speeches to you But it could not be Mr  B  if he did not Your Merit  extorts  it from him And what an ingrateful as well as absurd Churl would he be who should seek to obscure a meridian Lustre that dazles the Eyes of every one else  But let me observe moreover that you had so few of these fine Speeches  beforehand  that you have all the Reason in the World to expect them  now  And this lessens his Merit a good deal as the most he can say is but common Justice on  full Preof  ▪ for can the like Generosity be attributed to him as might to a Gentleman who praises  on Trust  You promise if I will come to you you will join with me against Mr  B  on this Subject 'Tis very kindly offer'd but when Mr  B  is in the Question I expect very little Assistance from you be the Argument what it will  But 'tis not  my  Fault I don't come I am quite tir'd with the perverse Folly of this  Nancy  of ours She every Day behaves  more  like a Fool to Mr  Murray  and  less  like a Sister to me and takes Delight  to teize and vex me by all the little ways in her Power And then Surliness and Illtemper are so natural to her that I who can but throw out a spiteful Word by way of Flourish as I may say and 'tis over and I am sorry for it as soon as spoken am no Match for herFor she  perseveres  so intolerably and comes back to the Attack tho' never so often repuls'd rising like  Antaeus  with fresh Vigour for every Fall or like the  Lernaean Hydra  which had a new Head sprouting up as fast as any one of the Seven was lopt off that there is no bearing her Wedlock in fine must be her  Hercules  and will furnish me I doubt with a Revenge I wish not for  But let me thank you for your delightful Narratives and beg you to continue them I told you how your  Saturday's  Conversation with Lady  Davers  and your  Sunday  Imployments charm us all So regular and so easy to be perform'dThat's the delightful thing What every body may do And yet so beautiful so laudable so uncommon in the Practice especially among People in genteel Life  Your Conversation and Decision in relation to the two Parsons more than charm transport us Mr  B  let me tell you judges right and acts a charming Part to throw such a fine Game into your Hands And so excellently do you play it that never surely was so happy a Couple  He has a prodigious Merit  with  me I can tell him tho' he thinks not so well  of  me as I would have him To  see  to  praise  and to  reward  a Virtue is  next  to having it  one's self  And in time he will make as good a  Man  these fine Appearances encourage one to hope so as he is a  Husband    Your Notions of Dispensations and double Livings are admirably just Mr  Williams  is more  my Favourite than everAnd the amplyrewarded Mr  Adams  how did that Scene affect us  Again and again I say for what can I say else or more since I can't find Words to speak all I think you're a charming Lady Yet methinks poor Mr  H  makes but a sorry Figure among you  We are delighted with Lady  Davers  but still more if possible with the Countess She is a fine Lady as you have drawn her but your Characters tho' Truth and Nature are the most shocking or the most amiable that ever I read  We are full of Impatience to hear of the Arrival of Sir  Jacob Swynford  We know his Character pretty well But when he has sat for it to your Pencil it must be an Original indeed  I will have another Trial with my Papa to move him to let me attend you I am rallying my Forces for that Purpose I have got my Mamma on my Side again who is concern'd to see her Girl vexed and insulted by her younger Sister and who yet minds no more what  she  says to her than what  I  say and Sir  Simon  loves at his Heart to make Mischief between us instead of interposing to silence either And truly I am afraid the Delight of this kind which he takes will make him deny his  Polly  what she so ardently wishes for  I had a good Mind to be sick to be with you I could fast two or three Days to give it the better Appearance but then my Mamma who loves not Deceit would blame me if she knew my Stratagem and be grieved if she thought I was really ill I know Fasting when one has a Stomach to eat gives one a very gloomy and mortify'd Air  What would not one do in short to procure to one's self the inexpressible Pleasure that I should have in your Company and Conversation But  continue to write to me till then however and that will be  next Best  I am  Your most obliged and obedient  POLLY DARNFORD  LETTER XXXVI From the same  My dearest Mrs  B  I Am all over Joy and Rapture My good Papa has given me Leave to tell you that he will put his  Polly  under your Protection when you go to  London  If you have but a Tenth Part of the Pleasure I have on this Occasion I am sure I shall be as welcome as I wish But he will insist upon it he says that Mr  B  signs some Acknowlegement which I am to carry along with  me  that I am intrusted to his Honour and yours and to be returned to him  Heartwhole  and  Dutiful  and with a Reputation as unsully'd as he receives me  But do dearest Mrs  B  continue your Journals till then for I have promis'd to take them up where you leave off to divert our Friends in these Parts There will be Presumption But yet I will write nothing but what I will shew you and have your Consent to send For I was taught early not to tell Tales out of School and a School the best I ever went to will be your charming Conversation  We have been greatly diverted with the Trick put upon that Barbarian Sir  Jacob  His Obstinacy Repentance and Amendment follow'd so irresistibly in one Halfhour from the happy Thought of the excellent Lady Countess that I think no Plot was ever more fortunate It was like springing a lucky Mine in a Siege that blew up twenty times more than was expected from it and answer'd all the Besieger's Ends at once  Mr  B  's Defence of his own Conduct towards you is quite noble and he judges with his usual Generosity and good Sense when by adding to your Honour he knows he inhances his own Mr  Pitt  's fine Diamond met with a world of Admirers but all turn'd upon this Reflection What a happy Man is Mr  Pitt  who can call such a Jewel his ownHow greatly do you excel this Diamond and how much does Mr  B  outdo Mr  Pitt  Who has contributed to give so rich a Jewel a Polish so admirable and then has set it in so noble a Light as makes its Beauty conspicuous to every Eye  You bid me skim over your Writings lightly bur 'tis impossible I will not flatter you my dear Mrs  B  nor will I be suspected to do so and yet I cannot find Words to praise so much as I think you deserve So I will only say that your good Parents for whose Pleasure you write as well as for mine cannot receive or read them with more Delight than I doEven my Sister  Nancy  judge of their Effect by this will at any time leave  Murray  and forget to frown or be illnatur'd while she can hear read what you writeAnd angry as she makes me sometimes I cannot deny her this Pleasure because possibly among the innumerable improving Reflections they abound with some one may possibly dart in upon her and illuminate her as your Conversation and Behaviour did Sir  Jacob    But your Application in P S to my Papa pleased him and confirmed his Resolution to let me goHe snatched the Sheet that contained this That's to me said he I must read this myself He didand saidI'faith she's a sweet one  Do▪ dear good Sir  Simon repeated he aloud  let Miss  Polly  add to our Delights  So she shall then  If that will do itAnd yet this same Mrs  B  has so many Delights already that I should think she might be contentedBut Dame  Darnford  I think I'll let her go These Sisters then you'll see how they'll love at a Distance tho' always quarrelling when together He read on  The new Affair will divert you Lady  Darnford  has consented Miss is willing and her Sister can spare her  Very prettily put faith  And don't you be so cross  Very sweet  to deny me  Why dear Mrs  B  I won't be so cross then indeed I won'tAnd so  Polly  let 'em send Word when  they  set out for  London  and  you  shall join 'em there with all my Heart But I'll have a Letter every Post remember that Girl  Any thing any thing dear Papa said I so I can but go He called for a Kiss for his Compliance I gave it most willingly you may believe  Nancy  looked envious altho' Mr  Murray  came in just thenShe look'd almost like a great Glutton whom I remember one Sir  Jonathan Smith  who killed himself by eating He us'd while he was heaping up his Plate from one Dish to watch the others and follow the Knife of every Body else with such a greedy Eye as if he could swear a Robbery against any one who presumed to eat as well as he This is a gross Simile but all greedy and envious Folks look alike about the Eyes and thinking of  Nancy  on this Occasion who envied a Happiness she knew I preferred to that she has in Prospect I could not but call to mind Sir  Jonathan  at the same time  Well let's know when you set out and you shan't have been a Week in  London  if I can help it but you shall be told by my Tongue as now by my Pen how much I am  Your obliged Admirer and Friend  POLLY DARNFORD  P S  Remember the Verses I wrote about if proper  See this  Vol  p      You hint too at some other Verses  Ibid  p    Don't let us lose any thing  LETTER XXXVII  My dear Miss    I NOW proceed with my Journal which I had brought down to  Thursday  Night  FRIDAY  The two Ladies resolving as they said to inspect all my Proceedings insisted upon it that I would take them with me in my  benevolent Round  as they after we return'd would call it which I generally take once a Week among my poor and sick Neighbours and finding I could not get off I set out with them my Lady Countess proposing Mrs  Worden  to fill up the fourth Place in the Coach  We talked all the Way of Charity and the Excellency of that Duty and my Lady  Davers  took Notice of the Text that it would hide a  Multitude of Faults  And if as she was pleased to say there was to be any Truth in the Popish Doctrine of Supererogation what abundance of  such  Merits would arise from the Life and Actions of our dear Friend here kindly looking at me  I said That when we had the Pleasure to reflect that we served a Master who exacted no hard Terms from us but in every Case almost that could be thought of only required of us to do Justice and shew Mercy to one another and gave us Reason to think he would judge us by those Rules it must be a mighty Inducement to Acts of Charity  and Benevolence But indeed added I were there not that Inducement the Pleasure that attends such Acts is an high Reward and I am sure the Ladies I have the Honour to speak to must have found it in an hundred Instances  The Countess said She had once a much better Opinion of herself than she found she had Reason for within these  few Days  past And indeed Mrs  B  said she when I get home I shall make a good many People the better for your Example And so said Lady  Davers  which gave me no small inward Pleasure and I acknowleg'd in suitable Terms the Honour they both did me  The Coach set us down by the Side of a large Common about five Miles distant from our House and we alighted and walked a little Way chusing not to have the Coach come nearer that we might be taken as little Notice of as possible and they entered with me into two mean Cots with great Condescension and Goodness one belonging to a poor Widow and five Children who had been all down in Agues and Fevers the other to a Man and his Wife Bedrid with Age and Infirmities and two honest Daughters one a Widow with two Children the other married to an Husbandman who had also been ill but now by comfortable Cordials and good Physick were pretty well to what they had been  The two Ladies were well pleased with my Demeanour to the good Folks To whom I said that as I should go soon to  London  I was willing to see them before I went to wish them better and better and to tell them that I should leave Orders with Mrs  Jervis  concerning them to whom they must make known their Wants and that Mr  Barrow  would take care of 'em I was  sure and do all that was in the Power of Physick for the Restoration of their Healths  Now you must know Miss that I am not so good as the old Ladies of former Days who used to distil Cordial Waters and prepare Medicines and dispense them themselves I knew if I was so inclined my dear Mr  B  would not have been pleased with it because in the Approbation he has kindly given to my present Method he has twice or thrice praised me that I don't carry my Charity to Extremes and make his House a Dispensatory I would not therefore by aiming at doing too much lose the Opportunity of doing any Good at all in these respects and besides as the vulgar Saying is One must creep before one goes But this is my Method  I am upon an Agreement with this Mr  Barrow  who is deemed a very skilful and honest Apothecary and one Mr  Simmonds  a Surgeon of like Character to attend all such Cases and Persons as I shall recommend Mr  Barrow  to administer Physick and Cordials as he shall judge proper and even in necessary Cases to call in a Physician And nowandthen calling one's self or sending a Servant to ask Questions all is kept right  Besides one can take this Method without the Ostentation as some would deem it which would attend the other and having one's dear Friend's Gate always crouded with unhappy Objects and some that deserve no Countenance perhaps and would possibly be the most clamorous And then one does not subject the Poor neither to the Insolence of Servants who sometimes in a Body's Absence might were they some Servants shew that they were far from being influenced by the same Motives as their Principals Besides the Advantage the Poor have from the Skill and Experience  which Education and constant Practice give to the Gentlemen I imploy and with whom I agree but by the Quarter because if there were a just Foundation of Complaint for Negligence or Hardness of Heart I would not be ty'd down from changing for in such Cases in a Crisis the poor People depending on the Assistance of those Gentlemen might look no farther and so my good Intentions might not only be frustrated but do Harm  My Lady  Davers  observed a Bible a Common Prayer Book and a Whole Duty of Man in each Cot in Leathern outside Cases to keep them clean and a Church Catechism or two for the Children and was pleased to say It was right And her Ladyship asked one of the Children a pretty Girl Who learnt her her Catechism And she court'sy'd and look'd at me for I  do  ask the Children Questions when I come to know how they improve 'Tis as I thought said my Lady my Sister provides for both Parts God bless you my Dear said she and tapp'd my Neck  My Ladies left Tokens of their Bounty behind them to both Families and all the good Folks blessed and pray'd for us at Parting And as we went out my Lady  Davers  with a serious Air was pleased to say to me Take care of your Health my dear Sister and God give you when it comes a happy Hour for how many real Mourners would you have if you were to be called early to reap the Fruits of your Piety  God's Will must be done my Lady said I The same Providence that has so wonderfully put it in my Power to do a little Good will raise up new Friends to the honest Hearts that rely upon Him  This I said because some of the good People heard my Lady and seem'd troubled and began to redouble their Prayers for my Safety and Preservation  We walked thence to our Coach and stretched a little farther to visit two Farmers Families about a Mile distant from each other One had the Mother of the Family with two Sons just recovering the former from a Fever the latter from Tertian Agues and I asked when they saw Mr  Barrow  They told me with great Commendations of him that he had but just left them So having congratulated their hopeful Way and wished them to take care of themselves and not go too early to Business I said I should desire Mr  Barrow  to watch over them for fear of Relapse and should hardly see 'em again for some time and so under the Notion of my Foy I dropt a Couple of Guineas in the good Woman's Hand For I had had an Hint given me by Mrs  Jervis  that their Illness had made it low with them  We proceeded then to the other Farm where the Case was a marry'd Daughter who had had a very dangerous Lyingin and a wicked Husband who had abus'd her and run away from her But she was mending apace by good comfortable Things which from time to time I had caused to be sent her Her old Father had been a little unkind to her before I took Notice of her for she marry'd against his Consent and indeed the World went hard with the poor Man and he could not do much and besides he had a younger Daughter who had lost all her Limbs and was forc'd to be ty'd in a Wicker Chair to keep her up in it which having expended much to relieve her was a great Pullback as the good old Woman called it And having been a Year in Arrear to a cruel Landlord who finding a good Stock upon the Ground wanted to distress the poor Family and turn them out of all I advanced the Money upon the Stock and the poor Man has already paid me half of it for I must keep within Compass too  Miss which was  l  at first and is in a fair Way to pay me the other Half and make as much more for himself  Here I found Mr  Barrow  and he gave me an Account of the Success of two other Cases I had recommended to him and told me that  John Smith  a poor Man who in thatching a Barn had tumbled down and broken his Leg and bruised himself all over was in a fair way of Recovery  This poor Creature had like to have perished by the Cruelty of the Parish Officers who would have pass'd him away to  Essex  where his Settlement was tho' in a burning Fever occasioned by his Misfortune But hearing of the Case I directed Mr  Simmonds  to attend him and provide for him at my Expence and gave my Word if he dy'd to bury him  I was glad to hear he was in so good a way and told Mr  Barrow  I hoped to see him and Mr  Simmonds  together at Mr  B  's before I set out for  London  that we might advise about the Cases under their Direction and that I might acquit myself of some of my Obligations to them  You are a good Man Mr  Barrow  added I God will bless you for your Care and Kindness to these poor destitute Creatures They all praise you and do nothing but talk of your Humanity to them  O my good Lady said he who can forbear following such an Example as you set Mr  Simmonds  can testify as well as I for nowandthen a Case requires us to visit together that we can hardly hear any Complaints from our poor Patients let 'em be ever so ill for the Praises and Blessings they bestow upon you  It is good Mr  B  that enables and encourages me to do what I do Tell them they must bless God and bless him and pray for me and thank you and Mr  Simmonds  We all join together you know for their Good  The Countess and Lady  Davers  asked the poor lyingin Woman many Questions and left with her and for her poor Sister a miserable Object indeed God be praised that I am not such an one Marks of their Bounty in Gold but I saw not how much and looking upon one another and then upon me and lifting up their Hands could not say a Word till they were in the Coach And so we were carry'd home after we had just look'd in upon a Country School where I pay for the Learning of Eight Children  And here Miss I hope I recite not this with Pride tho' I do with Pleasure is a cursory Account of my  Benevolent Weekly Round  as my Ladies will call it  I know you will not be displeased with it but it will highly delight my worthy Parents who in their way do a great deal of discreet Good in their Neighbourhood For indeed Miss a little Matter  prudently  bestowed and to true Objects of Compassion whose Cases are soon at a Crisis as are those of most labouring People will go a great way and especially if laid out properly for 'em according to the Exigencies of their respective Cases For such poor People who live generally low want very seldom any thing but reviving Cordials at first and good wholsome Kitchen Physick afterwards and then the Wheels of Nature being unclogg'd newoil'd as it were and set right they will go round again with Pleasantness and Ease for a good while together by virtue of that Exercise which their Labour gives them while the Rich and Voluptuous are forced to undergo great Fatigues to keep theirs clean and in Order  Thus is it well remarked in a Manuscript Poem in my dear Mr  B  's Possession written in Answer to a Friend who recommended a poor Man of Genius  to the Favour of the Author in order to induce the benevolent Gentleman to lift him into a higher Life than that to which he was born  Wou'dst thou by Change of Life I should intail  Gouts Fevers Surfeits ev'ry tort'ring Ail  That our rich Blood infects on this poor Swain  And turn his  fansy'd  Woes to  real  Pain  If he want Food or Raiment these will I  Fit for his Station chearfully supply  But is his slavish Life much more fatiguing  Than our bad Hours hard Huntings lewd Intriguing  For needful Exercise don't all who've Wealth  At times but to preserve themselves in Health  Our Bodies less prepar'd our Nerves less strong▪  Do more than any of the lab'ring Throng  I mention'd before  See this  Vol  p    that this Poem had given me some proper Hints in relation to the Good one should dispense in which one ought to consult a Person's usual way of Life and not to be so lavish to some one Object or two as should limit one's Power to relieve others and at the same time by lifting the poor Folks into a State they had not been used to make them possibly more unhappy than ever I will transcribe a few more Lines from this Piece for your Entertainment  But yet my Friend I cannot join with thee  To think so hard of  native  Poverty  'Tis not to live at Ease makes Happiness  Eat and drink well lie soft 'Tis nothing less  Than sweet  CONTENT  whatever be the State  Can make us truly happy wise or great  If  this  he want not whate'er else he be  He's happier far I judge than You or Me  And if he  want  it much I fear my friend  He'll find  no State  will his Condition mend  For human Minds still on aspiring bent  Not check'd at first are seldom e'er content  And again  The Man who in one Way was always bred  Till thrice Twelve Winters have pass'd o'er his Head▪  Is  or  should  be contented with his Fate  Nor covet  totally  to change his State  For Discontent once cherish'd in his Breast  Desire of Change will never let him rest  Unfix'd unsettled he all Comfort past  Knows his  first  Wish but ne'er will know his  last    I must go on a little further It seems that the recommending Friend had praised the poor Man for a Genius above the Sphere he was placed in To this the judicious Benefactor replies stating the Plea in the first Line  But he has Parts and Wit above his Sphere  The neighb'ring Throng will then his Wit revere  If by sound Judgment temper'd And who knows  How useful he may be but to compose  Small Strifes that even homely Cots invade  From rugged Minds by partial Passions sway'd  Shall nought but Thistles in one Climate grow  And intermingling no sweet Roses blow  Remote from Towns among the rural Swains  He'll be the  Priest  and  Justice  of the Plains  And nothing sure on Earth yields more Delight  Than diff'ring Minds in social Bands t'unite  I believe you'll excuse me if I transcribe more  We the Discomforts know of what we  are  But little think what States  superior  share  How aukwardly our Parts we should sustain  In a new Scene And Oh what mighty Pain  For this is not the least t' a gen'rous Mind  With Obligations press'd or to Dependence join'd  Or sit they light from  me  as e'er they will  'Tis Obligation and Dependence still  To thoughtful Minds  And grant he might be happy while I live  How may he fare with those who me survive  My Fortune may perhaps to those descend  Who knew not  Joseph  nor lov'd  Joseph  's Friend  Who like too many Heirs reverse whate'er  Was wont t' engage their Predecessors Care  In such a Case what Cause he'd have to mourn  Forc'd to the Life he  now  beholds with Scorn  By long Disuse made still  more  grievous to return  Shall the slow  Carthorse  with the  Courser  run  Wou'd ev'ry twinkling  Star  become a  Sun  Yet in their Order  this  adorns the Sky  And  that  helps on the gen'ral Harmony  Then follow some Lines that I often think of with Pleasure and which used to please my dear Lady who made me write them down in my Commonplace Book You my honoured Father and Mother have seen them  See  Vol II  p    But as you my dear Miss have not I will transcribe them  For thou want'st not to know wise Providence  Does various Parts for various Minds dispense  The  meanest Slaves  or those who  hedge  and  ditch  Are useful by their Sweat to feed the  Rich    The  Rich  in due Return impart their Store  Which comfortably feeds the lab'ring  Poor    Nor let the  Rich  the  lowest Slave  disdain  He's  equally  a  Link  of Nature's  Chain  Labours to the  same End  joins in  one View  And  both alike  the  Will divine  pursue  And at the last are levell'd  King  and  Slave  Without Distinction in the silent Grave  But now you'll be curious to know since this Gentleman declin'd raising the poor Man what Good he really thought proper to do for him This then will satisfy you  "  But he has Children  "  Well this is a Plea  That strongly recommends his Case to me  I'll take a Boy or two and if I find  The Youngsters honest faithful well inclin'd  If able to sustain those Parts which we  Call  vainly  better I'll their Patron be  First To the menial Service I'll inure 'em  And as they merit better will procure 'em  In short the Swain for what he is I'll prize  Consistent  with's  Degree  augment his Joys  And tell him this from me That wou'd he know  True Happiness unmix'd with certain Woe  Here  will he rest his Hopes nor  farther  wish to go  I don't remember ever to have read any thing of this Subject placed in these natural easy and I therefore  think uncommon Lights and believe you'll allow them to be right Lights For there are certainly no Cases in the World that require more Judgment and Distinction than charitable ones And except a casual Distress among those who make a Trade of Begging such Persons especially if I see them often and so much in the same Place as if they were as tenacious of their Stand as others of their Freehold move not my Compassion or Notice They cannot be lower in Spirit nor being frequently brought up to it do they often wish to be higher in Calling or to change their idle State for a laborious one But the poor industrious Souls reduced by Sickness or Misfortune or even Mistake not wilful or persisted in who sigh in Secret and cannot make known what they suffer such unhappy Objects are worthy of one's  Pains  to find out and relieve  SATURDAY Morning  IT is hardly right to trouble either of you my honoured Correspondents with an Affair that has vex'd me a good deal and indeed  should  affect me more than any other Mistress of a Family for Reasons which will be obvious to you when I tell you the Case And this it is so present with me I cannot forbear  A pretty genteel young Body my  Polly Barlow  as I call her having been well recommended and indeed behaved with great Prudence till this time is the Occasion And this it is  My dear Mr  B  and the Two Ladies agreed with me to take a little Airing in the Coach and to fall in upon Mr  Martin  who had a Present made him for his Menagerie in which he takes great Delight  of a rare and uncommon Creature a Native of the  East Indies  But just as Sir  Jacob  was on Horseback to accompany them and the Ladies were ready to go I was taken with a sudden Disorder and Faintishness so that Lady  Davers  who is very tender of me and watches every Turn of my Countenance would not let me go with them tho' my Disorder was going off and my dear Mr  B  was pleased to excuse me and just meeting with Mr  Williams  as they went to the Coach they took him with them to fill up the vacant Place So I retir'd to my Closet and shut myself in  They had asked Mr  H  to go with them as Company to Sir  Jacob  but he as I believe by what followed on purpose could not be found when they set out So they supposed he was upon some Ramble with Mr  Colbrand  his great Favourite  I was writing to  you  being pretty well recover'd when I heard  Polly  as I supposed and as it proved come into my Apartment and down she sat and sung a little Catch and cry'd Hem twice and presently I heard two Voices But suspecting nothing I wrote on till I heard a kind of Rustling and Struggling and  Polly  's Voice crying Fie How can you do so Pray Sir  This alarm'd me much because we have such orderly Folks about us and I looked thro' the Keyhole and to my Surprize and Concern saw Mr  H  foolish Gentleman taking Liberties with  Polly  that neither became him to offer nor more foolish Girl her to suffer  I did not know what to do But having Reason to think that this was not their first Interview and Freedom and the Girl sometimes encouragingly laughing as at other times inconsistently struggling and complaining in an Accent that was too tender for the Occasion I forced a faint Cough This  frighted them both Mr  H  swore and said Who can that be Your Lady's gone with them i'n't she  I believe so I hope so said the silly Girl Yet that was like her Voice Me'm are you in your Closet Me'm said she coming up to the Door Mr  H  standing like a poor Thief half behind the Windowcurtains till he knew if it was I  I open'd the Door away sneak'd Mr  H  and she leap'd with Surprize not hoping to find me there tho' she asked the Question  I thought Indeed Me'mI thought you were gone out  It is plain you did  Polly  Go and shut the Chamberdoor and come to me again  She did but trembled and was so full of Confusion that I pity'd the poor Creature and hardly knew how to speak to her or what to say For my Compassion got the Upperhand of my Resentment and as she stood quaking and trembling and looking on the Ground with a Countenance I cannot describe I nowandthen cast my Eye upon her and was as often forced to put my Handkerchief to it  At last I said How long have these Freedoms past  Polly  between you and Mr  H  She said never a Word  I am loth to be censorious  Polly  But 'tis too plain that Mr  H  would not have followed you into my Chamber if he had not met you at other Places before  Still the poor Girl said never a Word  Little did I expect  Polly  that you would have shewn so much Imprudence You have had Instances of the vile Arts of Men against poor Maidens Have you any Notion that Mr  H  intends to do honourably by you  Me'mMe'mI believeI hopeI dare say Mr  H  would not do otherwise  So much the worse that you believe so if you have not very good Reason for your Belief Does he pretend he will marry you  Polly  She was silent  Tell me  Polly  if he does  He says he will do honourably by me  But you know there is but one Word necessary to explain that other precious Word  Honour  in this Case It is  Matrimony  That Word's as soon spoken as any other and if he  means  it he will not be shy to  speak  it  She was silent  Tell me  Polly  for I am really greatly concern'd for you what you think yourself Do you  hope  he will marry you  She was silent  Do good  Polly  I hope I may call you  good  yet answer me  Pray Madam and she wept and turn'd from me to the WainscotPray Madam excuse me  But indeed  Polly  I  cannot  excuse you You are under my Protection I was once in as dangerous a Situation as you can be And I did not escape it Child by the Language and Conduct I heard from you  Language and Conduct Me'm  Yes  Polly  Language and Conduct For you have heard my Story no doubt All the World has And do you think if I had sat me down in my Lady's Bedchamber and sung a Song and hem'd twice and Mr  B  had come to me upon that Signal for such I doubt it was and I had kept my Place and suffer'd myself to be rumpled and only in a soft Voice and with an encouraging Laugh cry'd How can you do so that I should have been what I am  Me'm I dare say my Lord so all the Servants call him and his Aunt often when she puts  Jackey  to it means me no Hurt  No Hurt  Polly  What and make you cry  Fie  Or do you intend to trust your Honour to his Mercy rather than to your own Discretion  I hope not Me'm  I hope not too  Polly  But you know he was free enough with you to make you say  Fie  And what might have been the Case who knows had I not coughed on Purpose unwilling for your sake  Polly  to find Matters so bad as I feared and that you would have been led beyond what was reputable  Reputable Me'm  Yes  Polly  Reputable I am sorry you oblige me to speak so plain But your Good requires it Instead of flying from him you not only laughed all the time you cry'd out  Fie  and  How can you do so  but had no other Care then to see if any body heard you and you observe how he slid away like a guilty Gentleman as soon as I open'd my DoorDo these Things look well  Polly  Do you think they doAnd if you hope to emulate my good Fortune do you think  this  is the Way  I wish Me'm I had never seen Mr  H  For nobody will look upon me if I lose your Favour  It will still  Polly  and I took her Hand with a kind Look be in your own Power to keep it and I will not mention this Matter if you make me your Friend and tell me all that has pass'd  Again she wept and was silent  This made me more uneasy Don't think  Polly  said I that I would envy any other Person's Preferment when I have been so much exalted  myself If Mr  H  has talked to you of Marriage tell me  No Me'm I cann't say he has  yet    Yet Polly  Then he  never  will For when Men  do  talk of it they don't always  mean  it But whenever they  mean  it how can they confirm a doubting Maiden without  mentioning  it But alas alas for you poor  Polly  The Freedoms you have permitted to him no doubt previous to those I heard and which would have been greater possibly had I not surpris'd you with my Cough shew too well that he  need  not make any Promises to you  Indeed Me'mIndeed said she sobbing I might be too little upon my Guard but I would not have done any Ill for the World  I hope you would not  Polly  but if you suffer these Freedoms you can't tell  what  you'd have permittedTell me do you love Mr  H  He is a very goodhumour'd Gentleman Madam and is not proud  No 'tis not his Business to be proud when he hopes to humble youHumble you indeed Beneath the lowest Person of the Sex that is honest  I hope  You  hope  interrupted IYou  hope  too much and I  fear  a  great deal  for you because you fear  so little  for yourselfBut tell me How often have you been in private together  In private Me'mI don't know what your Ladyship calls  private  Why that is  private Polly  when as just now you neither hoped nor intended any body should see you  She was silent and I see Miss by this poor Girl that Lovers are true to their Secret tho' perhaps their Ruin depends upon it But it behov'd  me  on more Accounts than it would any body else as I hinted before to examine this Matter narrowly because if Mr  H  should marry her it would have been laid upon Mr  B  's Example And if my  Polly  should be ruin'd it would be a sad thing and People would have said Ay she could take Care enough of herself but none at all of her Servant  Her  Waitingmaid had a much more remiss Mistress than  Pamela  found or the Matter would not have been thus  Well  Polly  I see continued I that you will not speak out to me You may have  several  Reasons for it possibly tho' not  one  good one But as soon as Lady  Davers  comes in who has a great Concern in this Matter as well as Lord  Davers  and are answerable to Lord  H  in a Matter of so much importance as this I will leave it to her Ladyship's Consideration and shall no more concern myself to ask you Questions about itFor then I must take her Ladyship's Directions and part with you to be sure  The poor Girl frighted at this for every body fears Lady  Davers  wrung her Hands and begg'd for God's Sake I would not acquaint Lady  Davers  with it  But how can I help it said I Must I not connive at your Proceedings if I do not You are no Fool  Polly  in other Cases Tell me How is it possible for me in my Situation to avoid it  I will tell your Ladyship the whole Truth indeed I willif you will not tell Lady  Davers  I am ready to sink at the Thoughts of Lady  Davers  ' knowing any thing of this  This looked sadly I pity'd her but yet was angry in my Mind for I saw too plainly that her Conduct could not bear a Scrutiny not even in  her own  Opinion poor Creature  I said Make me acquainted with the Whole  Will your Ladyship promise  I'll promise nothing  Polly  When I have heard all you think fit to say I will do what befits me to do but with as much Tenderness as I can for youand that's all you ought to expect me to promise  Why then MadamBut how can I speak itI can speak sooner to any body but Lady  Davers  and you MadamFor her Ladyship's Passion and your Ladyship's Virtue How shall I And then she threw herself at my Feet and hid her Face with her Apron  I was in Agonies for her almost I wept over her I raised her up and said Tell me allYou cannot tell me worse than I apprehend nor I hope so bad O  Polly  tell me soonFor you give me great Pain  And my Back with Grief and Compassion for the poor Girl was ready to open as it seem'd to meIn my former Distresses I have been overcome by Fainting next to Death and was depriv'd of Sense for some MomentsBut else I should have imagin'd I must have had some such affecting Sensations as the unhappy Girl's Case gave me  Then Madam I own said she I have been too faulty  As how As what In what WayHow faultyasked I as quick as Thought You are not ruin'd are youTell me  Polly  No Madam but  But whatSay but what  I had consented  To what  To his Proposals Madam  What Proposals  Why Madam I was to  live  with Mr  H  I understand you too wellBut is it too late to break so wretched a BargainHave you already made a Sacrifice of your Honour  No Madam but I have given it under my Hand  Under your  Hand  Ah  Polly  if you have not given it under your  Heart  too it were well But what Foolishness is this What Consideration has he made you  He has given it under his Hand that he will always love me and when his Lordship's Father dies he will own me  What Foolishness is this said I on both sides But are you willing to be released from this vile Bargain  Indeed I am Madam and I told him so Yesterday But he says he will sue me and ruin me if I don't stand to it  You are ruin'd if you doAnd I wish But tell me  Polly  Are you not ruin'd as it is  Indeed I am not Madam  I doubt then said I you were upon the Brink of it had not this providential Indisposition kept me at homeYou met I suppose to conclude your shocking BargainO poor unhappy GirlBut let me see what he has given under his Hand  He has 'em both Madam to be drawn up fair and in a strong Hand that shall be like a Record  Could I have thought Miss that a Girl of Nineteen could be so ignorant and foolish in a Point so important when in every thing else she has shewn no Instances like this imprudent Folly  Has he given you Money  Yes Madam he gave mehe gave mea Note Here it is He says any body will give me Money for it  And this was a Bank Note of  l  which she pulled out of her Bosom  I instantly thought of those Lines of  Cowley  which my dear Lady several times made me read to her tho' these supposed an infinitely more excuseable Case  Marriage  for Money  Take Heed take Heed thou lovely Maid  Nor be by glitt'ring Ills betray'd  Thyself for Money O let no Man know  The Price of Beauty fall'n so low  What Dangers ought'st thou not to dread  When Love that's  blind  is by  blind  Fortune led  The Result was He was to settle  l  a Year upon her and  hers  poor poor GirlAnd he was to  own her  as she calls it but as Wife or Mistress she stipulated not when his Father dy'd and he came into the Title and Estate  I told her It was impossible for me to conceal the Matter from Lady  Davers  if she would not by her Promises to be govern'd intirely by me and to abandon all Thoughts of Mr  H  give me room to conclude that the wicked Bargain was at an End  And to keep the poor Soul in some Spirits and to enable her to look up and to be more easy under my Direction I blamed  him  more than I did  her  Tho' considering what Virtue requires of a Woman and Custom has made shameless in a Man I think the poor Girl inexcuseable and shall not be easy while she is about me For she is more to blame because of the two she has more Wit than the Man  But what can I do Miss if I put her away 'Twill be to throw her directly into his Hands He won't stay long and she  may  see her Folly But here her Eyes were open She knew what she had to trust toAnd by their wicked Beginning and  her encouraging Repulses I doubt she would have been utterly ruin'd that very Day  I knew the Rage Lady  Davers  would be in with both So this was another Embarass And yet should my good Intentions be frustrated and they should conclude their vile Bargain and it appear'd that I knew of it but would not acquaint her then should I have been blam'd more than any Mistress of a Family being circumstanc'd as I am  Upon the Whole As to the Girl I resolv'd to comfort her as well as I could till I had gain'd her Confidence that my Advice might have the more Weight with her and by Degrees be the more likely to reclaim her For poor Soul there would be an End of her Reputation the most precious of all Jewels the Moment the Matter was known and that would be a sad thing  And as to the Man I thought it best to take Courage and you that know me will say I must have a good deal more than usual to talk to Mr  H  on this Subject  And the poor Body consenting I should and with great Protestations declaring her Sorrow and Repentance begging me to get her Note of Hand again on which she laid a foolish Stress and desiring me to give him back his Note of  l  I went down to find him  He shunn'd me as a Thief would a Constable at the Head of a Hue and Cry As I entered one Place or Room he went into another looking with conscious Guilt but yet confidently humming a Tune At last I fixed him speaking to  Rachel  bidding her tell  Polly  he wanted to send a Message by her to her Lady By which I doubted not he was desirous to know what she had owned in order to govern himself accordingly  His Back was toward me and I said Mr  H  here I am myself to take your Commands  He gave a Caper half a Yard highMadam I wantedI wanted to speak toI would have spoken with  You wanted to send  Polly  to me perhaps Mr  H  to ask if I would take a little Walk with you in the Garden  Very true MadamVery true indeedYou have guess'd the MatterI thought it was pity this fine Day as every body was taking an Airing  Well then Sir please to lead the Way and I'll attend you  Yet I fansy Madam the Wind is a little too high for youWon't you catch Cold  No never fear Mr  H  I am not afraid of a little Air  I will attend you presently Madam You'll be in the great Gravel Walk or on the TerraceI'll wait upon you in an Instant  I had the Courage to take hold of his Arm as if I had like to have slipt For thought I thou shalt not see the Girl worthy Friend till I have talk'd to thee a little if thou dost then Excuse me Mr  H  I hope I have not hurt my FootI must lean upon you  Will you be pleas'd Madam to have a Chair I fear you have sprain'd your FootShall I help you to a Chair  No no Sir I shall walk it off if I hold by you  So he had no Excuse to leave me and we proceeded into the Garden But never did any thing look so sillySo like a  foolish Fellow  as his Aunt calls him He looked if possible half a dozen Ways at once hem'd cough'd wriggled about turn'd his Head behind him every nowandthen and started  half a dozen silly Subjects in hopes to hinder me from speaking  I appear'd I believe under some Concern how to begin with him for he would have it I was not very well and begg'd he might step in one Minute to desire Mrs  Jervis  to attend me  So I resolved to begin with him lest I should lose the Opportunity seeing my Eel so very slippery And placing myself at the Seat at the upper End of the Gravel Walk I asked him to sit down He declined it and would wait upon me presently he said and seemed going So I beganIt is easy for me Mr  H  to penetrate the Reason why you are so willing to leave me But 'tis for your  own  Sake that I desire you to hear me that no Mischief may ensue among Friends and Relations on an Occasion to which you are no Stranger  Lord Madam What can you meanSurely Madam you don't think amiss of a little innocent Liberty or so  Mr  H  reply'd I I want not any Evidence of your inhospitable Designs upon a poor unwary young Creature whom your Birth and Quality have found it too easy a Task to influence  Inhospitable Designs  MadamA harsh Word by GadYou very nice Ladies cannot admit of the least Freedom in the WorldWhy Madam I have kiss'd a Lady's Woman before now in a civil way or so and never was call'd to an Account for it as a Breach of Hospitality  'Tis not for me Mr  H  said I to proceed to  very nice  Particulars with a Gentleman who can act as you have done by a poor Girl that could not have had the Assurance to look up to a Man of your Quality had you not levell'd all Distinction between you in order to level the weak Creature to the common Dirt of the Highway I must tell you that the  poor Girl heartily repents of her Folly and to shew you that it signifies nothing to deny it she begs you will give her back the Note of her Hand you have extorted from her Foolishness and I hope you'll be so much of a Gentleman as not to keep in your Power such a Testimony of the Weakness of any of the Sex  Has she told you that MadamWhy maybe indeedI can't but sayTruly it mayn't look so well to you Madam But young Folks will have FrolicksIt was nothing but a FrolickLet me  be hang'd  if it was  Be pleased then Sir to give up her Note to me to return to herReputation should not be frolick'd with Sir especially that of a poor Girl who has nothing else to depend upon  I'll give it to her myself and laugh at her into the Bargain if you please Madam Why 'tis comical enough if the little Pug thought I was in Earnest I must have a Laugh or two at her Madam when I give it her up  Mr  H  said I since 'tis but a Frolick you won't take it amiss that when we are set down to Supper we call  Polly  in and demand a Sight of her Note and that will make every one merry as well as you  Cotso Madam that mayn't be so well neither For perhaps they will be apt to think it is in Earnest when as I hope to live 'tis but a Jest Nothing in the World else upon Honour  I put on then a still more serious AirAs you  hope to live  say you Mr  H  and  upon your Honour  How fear you not an instant Punishment for this Appeal and what is the  Honour  you swear by Take that and answer me Sir Do Gentlemen give away Bank Notes for  Frolicks  and for  mere Jests  and  nothing in the World  elseI am sorry to be obliged to deal thus with you But I thought  I was talking to a Gentleman that would not forfeit his Veracity and that in so solemn an Instance as this  He looked like a Man Thunderstruck His Face was distorted and his Head seemed to turn about upon his Neck like a Weathercock in a Hurricane to all Points of the Compass His Hands clenched as in a Passion and yet Shame and Confusion struggling in every Limb and Feature  At last he said I am confoundedly betrayed But if I am exposed for the Wretch thought of nobody but himself to my Uncle and Aunt I am undone and shall never be able to look 'em in the Face 'Tis true I had a Design upon her and since she has betray'd me I think I may say that she was as willing almost as I  Ungenerous contemptible Wretch thought I But our Sex that can thus give up their Virtue ought to expect no better For he that sticks not at  one  bad Action will not scruple  another  to vindicate himself And so Devillike become the Tempter and the Accuser too  But if you will be so good said he as to take no Notice of this to my Uncle and especially to my Aunt and Mr  B  I swear to you I never will think of her as long as I live  And you'll bind this Promise will you Sir by  your Honour  and as you  hope to live  Dear good Madam forgive me I beseech you Don't be so severe upon me By all that's  Don't swear Mr  H  But as an Earnest that I may believe you give me back the Girl's foolish Note that tho' 'tis of no Signification she may not have  that  to witness to her Folly  He took out his PocketBook There it is MadamAnd I beg you'll forgive this Attempt I see I ought not to have made it I doubt it was a Breach  of the Laws of Hospitality as you say But to make it known will only expose me and it can do no Good and Mr  B  will resent it maybe and my Aunt will never let me hear the last of it nor my Uncle neitherAnd I shall be sent to travel againAnd added the poor Creature I was once in a Storm and the crossing the Sea again would be Death to me  What a Wretch art thou thought IWhat could such an one as thou find to say to a poor Creature that if put in the Scale against Virtue and Honour should make the latter kick the Beam Poor poor  Polly Barlow  thou art sunk indeed Too low for Excuse and almost beneath Pity  I told him if I could observe that nothing pass'd between them that should lay me under a Necessity of revealing the Matter I should not be forward to expose him nor the Maiden either But that he must in his own Judgment excuse me if I made every body acquainted with it if I were to see the Correspondence between them likely to be renewed or carried on For added in that Case I should owe it to myself to Mr  B  to Lord and Lady  Davers  and to you and the unhappy Body too to do so  He would needs drop down on one Knee to promise this and with a thousand Acknowlegements left me to find Mr  Colbrand  in order to ride to meet the Coach on its Return  I went in and gave the foolish Note to the silly Girl which she receiv'd eagerly and immediately burnt and I told her I would not suffer her to come near me but as little as possible when I was in Company while Mr  H  staid but consigned her intirely to the Care of Mrs  Jervis  to whom only I said I would hint the Matter as tenderly as I could And for this I added I had more Reasons than one First To give her the Benefit of a good Gentlewoman's  Advice to which I had myself formerly been beholden and from whom I concealed nothing Next To keep her out of Mr  H  's Way And lastly That I might have an Opportunity from Mrs  Jervis  's Opinion to judge of the Sincerity of her Repentance For  Polly  said I you must imagine so regular and uniform as all our Family is and so good as I thought all the People about me were that I could not suspect that she the Duties of whose Place made her nearest to my Person was the farthest from what I wished  I have set this Matter so strongly before her and Mrs  Jervis  has so well seconded me that I hope the best for the Grief the poor Creature carries in her Looks and expresses in her Words cannot be described frequently accusing herself with Tears saying often to Mrs  Jervis  She is not worthy to stand in the Presence of a Mistress whose Example she has made so bad an Use of and whose Lessons she had so ill followed  I am sadly troubled at this Matter however but I take great Comfort in reflecting that my sudden Indisposition look'd like a providential Thing which may save one poor Soul and be a seasonable Warning to her as long as she lives  Mean time I must observe that at Supper last Night Mr  H  look'd abject and mean and like a poor Thief as I thought and conscious of his disappointed Folly tho' I seldom glanc'd my Eye upon him had less to say for himself than ever  And once my Lady  Davers  laughing said I think in my Heart my Nephew looks more foolish every time I see him than the last  He stole a Look at me and blush'd and my Lord said  Jackey  has some GraceHe blushes Hold up thy Head Nephew Hast thou nothing at all to say for thyself  Sir  Jacob  said A Blush becomes a young GentlemanI never saw one before tho' in Mr  H  What's the Matter Sir  Only said Lady  Davers  his Skin or his Conscience is mended that's all  Thank you Madam was all he said bowing to his Aunt and affecting a careless yet confused Air as if he whisper'd a Whistle  Oh Wretch thought I see what it is to have a condemning Conscience while every  innocent  Person looks round unconscious smiling and erect But yet it was not the Shame of a bad Action I doubt but being discovered and disappointed that gave him this Confusion of Face  What a sad Thing it is for a Person to be guilty of such Actions as shall put it into the Power of another even by a Look to mortify him And if poor Souls can be thus abjectly struck at such a Discovery as this by a Fellow Creature how must they appear before an unerring and omniscient Judge with a Conscience standing in the Place of a thousand WitnessesThe Words  Weeping  and  Wailing Howling  and  Gnashing of Teeth  exceedingly well express what nothing but the Divine Book can equally express which in another Place points them out as calling upon the  Mountains to fall upon them  and the  Hills to cover them  How serious this Subject makes one  SATURDAY Evening  I AM just retired from a kind of fatiguing Service for who should come hither to dine with Mr  B  but that sad Rake Sir  Charles Hargrave  and Mr  Walgrave  Mr  Sedley  and Mr  Floyd  three as bad as himself inseparable Companions whose whole  Delight and that avowedly is Drinking and Hunting and Lewdness but otherwise Gentlemen of Wit and large Estates Three of them broke in upon us at the  See  Vol II  p    Hall on the happiest Day of my Life to our great Regret and they had been long threatening to make this Visit in order to see me as they told Mr  B  They whipt out two Bottles of  Champaign  instantly for a  Whet  as they called it and went to view the Stud and the Kennel and then took a Walk in the Garden till Dinner was ready my Lord  Davers  Mr  H  and Sir  Jacob  as well as Mr  B  for they are all acquainted accompanying them  Sir  Charles  it seems as Lord  Davers  told me afterwards said He long'd to see Mrs  B  She was the Talk whereever he went and he had conceiv'd an high Opinion of her beforehand  Lord  Davers  said I defy you Gentlemen to think so highly of her as she deserves take Mind and Person together  Mr  Floyd  said He never saw any Woman yet that came up to what he expected where Fame had been lavish in her Praise  But how Brother Baronet said Sir  Charles  to Sir  Jacob  came  you  to be reconcil'd to herI heard that you would never own her  Oons Man said Sir  Jacob  I was taken in I was by my Soul They contrived to clap her upon me as Lady  Jenny C  and pretended they'd keep t'other out of my Sight and I was plaguily bit and forced to get off as well as I could  That was a Bite indeed said Mr  Walgrave  and so you fell a praising Lady  Jenny  I warrant to the Skies  Yeas by my Soul drawling out the affirmative Monosyllable I was used most scurvily 'faith I wasI bear 'em a Grudge for't still I can tell 'em that for I have hardly been able to hold up my Head like a Man ever sincebut am forc'd to sneak about and go and come and do as they bid me By my Troth I never was so manageable in my Life  Your  Herefordshire  Neighbours Sir  Jacob  said Mr  Sedley  with an Oath will rejoice to hear this for the whole County there cannot manage you  I'm quite cow'd now by my Soul as you will see byandby Nay for that Matter if you can set Mrs  B  a talking there's ne'er a Puppy of you all will care to open your Lips except to say as she says  Never fear old Boy said Sir  Charles  we'll bear our Parts in Conversation I never saw the Woman yet that could give me either Awe or Love for six Minutes together What think  you  Mr  B  Have you any Notion that your Lady will have so much Power over us  I think Sir  Charles  I have one of the finest Women in  England  but I neither expect nor desire you Rakes should see her with my Eyes  You know if I have a Mind to love her and make Court to her too Mr  B  I will And I am half in Love with her already altho' I have not seen her  They came in when Dinner was near ready and the Four Gentlemen took each a large Bumper of Old Hock for another Whet  The Countess Lady  Davers  and I came down together The Gentlemen knew our two noble Guests and were known to them in Person as well as by Character Mr  B  in his usual kind and encouraging Manner took my Hand and presented the Four Gentlemen to me each by his Name Sir  Charles  said pretty bluntly That he hoped he was  more welcome to me now than the last time he was under the same Roof with me for he had been told since that  that  was our happy Day  I said Mr  B  's Friends were always welcome to me  'Tis well Madam said Mr  Sedley  we did not know how it was We should have quarter'd ourselves upon Mr  B  for a Week together and kept him up Day and Night  I thought this Speech deserved no Answer especially as they were Gentlemen who wanted no Countenance and address'd myself to Lord  Davers  who is always kindly making Court to me I hope my good Lord said I you find yourself quite recover'd of your Headach of which he complained at Breakfast  I thank you my dear Sister pretty well  I was telling Sir  Charles  and the other Gentlemen Niece said Sir  Jacob  how I was cheated here when I came first with a Lady  Jenny    It was a very lucky Cheat for me Sir  Jacob  for it gave you a Prepossession in my Favour under so advantageous a Character that I could never have expected otherwise  I wish said the Countess my Daughter for whom Sir  Jacob  took you had Mrs  B  's Qualities to boast of  How am I obliged to your Ladyship's Goodness return'd I when you treat me with even greater Indulgence than you use to so beloved a Daughter  Nay now you talk of treating said Sir  Charles  when Ladies will you treat our Sex with the Politeness which you shew to one another  When your Sex deserve it Sir  Charles  said Lady  Davers    Who is to be Judge of that said Mr  Walgrave    Not the Gentlemen I hope reply'd my Lady  Well then Mrs  B  said Sir  Charles  we bespeak your good Opinion of  us  for you have  ours    I am obliged to you Gentlemen but I must be more cautious in declaring  mine  lest it should be thought I am influenc'd by your kind and perhaps too hasty Opinions of me  Sir  Charles  swore they had  seen  enough of me the Moment I entered the Parlour and  heard  enough the Moment I opened my Lips to answer for  their  Opinions of me  I said I made no doubt when  they  had as good a Subject to expatiate upon as I had in the Pleasure before me of seeing so many agreeable Friends of Mr  B  's they would maintain the Title they claim'd to every one's good Opinion  This said Sir  Jacob  is binding you over Gentlemen to your good Behaviour You must know my Niece never shoots flying as  you  do  The Gentlemen laugh'd Is it shooting flying Sir  Jacob  return'd Sir  Charles  to praise that Lady  Adsbud I did not think of that  O Sir  Jacob  said the Countess you need not be at a Fault for a good Sportsman always hits his Mark flying or not And the Gentlemen had so fair an one that they could not well miss it  You are fairly help'd over the Stile Sir  Jacob  said Mr  Floyd    And indeed I wanted it tho' I limp'd like a Puppy before I was lame One can't think of every thing as one us'd to do at your Time of Life Gentlemen  This flippant Stuff was all that pass'd which I  can  recite for the rest at Table and after Dinner was too polite by half for me Such as The Quantity of Wine each Man could  carry off  that was the Phrase Dogs Horses Hunting Racing Cockfighting and all accompanied with Swearing and  Cursing and that in good Humour and out of Wantonness the least excusable and most profligate Sort of Swearing and Cursing of all loud Laughing with a little touching nowandthen on the Borders of Sir  Simon  's beloved Subject to try if they could make a Lady shew she  understood  their Hints by her  Blushes  See  Vol II  p    a certain Indication that those who seek a Blush in others are past it themselves and by their turning it into Ridicule when they find it in their Friends that they would not for the World have it imputed to them talking three or four at once and as loud as if they were in the Field pursuing their Game at a Quarter of a Mile's Distance from one another  These were the Subjects and this the Entertainment that held my Ladies and me for one Hour after a tedious Dinner when we retir'd and glad we were to do so And so well did the Gentlemen like the Wine that we had the Felicity to drink Tea and Coffee by ourselves only Mr  B  upon our inviting the Gentlemen to partake with us sliding in for a few Minutes to tell us they would stick by what they had and taking a Dish of Coffee with us  I should not omit one Observation That Sir  Jacob  when they were gone said They were  pure Company  And Mr  H  That he never was so delighted in his  born Days  While the two Ladies put up their Prayers that they might never have such another Entertainment And being encouraged by their Declaration I presumed to join in the same Petition  Yet it seems these are Men of Wit I believe they must be so because I could neither like nor understand them Yet if their Conversation had much Wit in it I should think my Ladies would have found it out  However this they did find out and agree in that these Gentlemen were of the true modern Cast of Libertines and Foxhunters and indifferently as they liked them could not be easily outdone by any of the same Stamp in  England    God defend my dear Miss  Darnford  and every worthy single Lady from such an Husband as a Gentleman of this Character would make  I wonder really how Mr  B  who chuses not this sort of Conversation and always whatever Faults he had besides was a  sober  Gentleman can sit for Hours so easy and chearful in it and yet he never says much when they are in their high Delight  When all's done Miss there are very unpleasant Things which Persons in  genteel  Life are forced to put up with as well as those in  lower  and were the one to be balanced against the other the Difference as to true Happiness would not perhaps be so great as People in the latter imagine if it did not turn in their Favour Well says the above quoted Manuscript  We the Discomforts know of what we are  But little think what States superior share  The Gentlemen permit me to add went away very merry to ride ten Miles by Owllight for they would not accept of Beds here They had two  French  Horns with them and gave us a Blast or Flourish or two at going off Each had a Servant besides But the Way they were in would have given me more Concern than it did had they been related to Mr  B  and less used to it And indeed it is a Happiness that such Gentlemen take no more Care than they generally do to interest any body intimately in their Healths and Preservation for these are all single Men Nor is the Publick any more than the Private under any Necessity to be much  concern'd about them for let such Persons go when they will if they continue single their next Heir cannot well be a worse Commonwealth'sman and there is a great Chance he may be a better  You know I end my  Saturdays  seriously And this to what I have already said makes me add that I cannot express how much I am my dear Miss  Your faithful and affectionate  P B  LETTER XXXVIII From Mrs  B  to Miss  Darnford  In Answer to Letters  XXXV  and  XXXVI  My dear Miss  Darnford  I Skip over the little Transactions of several Days to let you know how much you rejoice me in telling me  See p    Sir  Simon  has been so kind as to comply with my Wishes Both your charming Letters came to my Hand together and I thank you an hundred times for them and I thank your dear Mamma and Sir  Simon  too for the Pleasure they have given me in this obliging Permission How happy shall we be together But how long will you be permitted to stay tho' All the Winter I hope And then when that is over let us set out together if God shall spare us directly for  Lincolnshire  and so pass most of the Summer too in each other's Company What a sweet Thought is this Let me indulge it a little while  Mr  B  read your Letters and says You are a charming young Lady and surpass yourself in every  Letter I told him that he was more interested in the Pleasure I took in this Favour of Sir  Simon  's than he imagin'd As how my Dear said he A plain Case Sir reply'd I For endeavouring to improve myself by Miss  Darnford  's Conversation and Behaviour I shall every Day be more worthy of your Favour He kindly would have it that nobody no not Miss  Darnford  herself excelled me  'Tis right you know Miss he should think so tho' I must know nothing at all if I was not sensible how inferior I am to my dear Miss  Darnford  And yet when I look abroad nowandthen I could be a proud Slut if I would and not yield the Palm to many others But don't let every body know how vain I am Yet they may too if they take in at the same time that I have some Excuse when I have won so happily the Favour of two such Judges as Mr  B  and Miss  Darnford  and had the good Fortune too to rejoice in that of Lady Davers and the Countess of  C  Well my dear Miss  SUNDAY  IS past and gone as happily as the last the two Ladies and at  their  earnest Request Sir  Jacob  bearing us Company in the Evening Part My  Polly  was there Morning and Evening with her Heart broken almost poor GirlI put her in a Corner of my Closet because her Concern should not be minded Mrs  Jervis  gives me great Hopes of herAnd she seems to abhor the Thought of Mr  H  But as there proves to be so little of real Love in her Heart tho' even if there had she would have been without Excuseis she not the wickeder by half for that Miss To consent and take  Earnest  as I may say to live with a Man  who did not pretend to marry herHow inexcusable thisWhat a FrailtyYet so modest in Appearance so honestly descended and an Example so much betterforgive me to saybefore her Dear dear how could it be  Sir  Jacob  was much pleased with our Family Order and said 'Twas no Wonder I  kept  so good myself that was his Word and made others so and he was of Opinion that the four Rakes for he run on how much they admir'd me would be converted if they saw how well I passed my Time and how chearful and easy every one as well as myself was under it He said when he came home he thought he must take such a Method himself in  his  Family for he believed it would make not only better Masters and Mistresses but better Children and better Servants too But poor Gentleman he has I doubt a great deal to mend in  himself  before he can begin such a Practice with Efficacy in his  Family    MONDAY  IN the Afternoon Sir  Jacob  took his Leave of us highly satisfy'd with us both and  particularly  so he saidwith me and promised that my  two Cousins  as he call'd his Daughtersand his Sister an old Maiden Lady if they went to Town this Winter should visit me and be improved by me that was his Word Mr  B  accompany'd him some Miles on his Journey attended by Mr  Colbrand  and  Abraham  and the two Ladies and Lord  Davers  and I took an Airing in the Coach  Mr  B  was so kind as to tell me when he came home with a Whisper that Miss  Goodwin  presented her Duty to meI have got a Multitude of fine  Things for the dear little Creature and Mr  B  promises to give me a Dairyhouse Breakfast when our Guests are gone  I inclose the History of this little Charmer  See  Vol II p  seq  by my Beloved's Consent since you are to do us the Honour as he as well as I pleases himself to be one of our FamilyBut keep it to yourself whatever you do I am Guaranty that you will and have put it in a separate Paper that you may burn it as soon as you have read itFor I shall want your Advice maybe on this Subject having a great Desire to get this Child into my Possession and yet Lady  Davers  has given me an  See  p  of this Volume  Hint that dwells a little with me When I have the Pleasure I hope for I will lay all before you and be determined and proceed as far as I have Power by you You my good Father and Mother know the Story by my former Papers  TUESDAY  YOU must know I pass over the Days thus swiftly not that I could not fill them up with Writing as ample as I have done the former But having a Mind to give you a general Idea of our Way of Life and Conversation and having gone thro' a whole Week and more you may judge pretty well how it is one Day with another Nowandthen neighbourly Visits received and paid Needlework sometimes Musick nowandthen Cards sometimes tho' I don't love themOne more benevolent RoundImproving Conversations with my dear Mr  B  and my two good LadiesA Lesson  when alone either in  French  or  Latin  which my Master always learns me on his Knee There's Encouragement A new Pauper Case or twoA Visit from the good DeanMr  Williams  's Departure in order to put the newprojected Alteration in Force which is to deprive me of my Chaplain By the way the Dean is highly pleased with this Affair and the Motives for it Mr  Adams  being a Favourite of his and a distant Relation of his LadyMr  H  's and  Polly  's mutual Endeavour to avoid one anotherMy Lessons to the poor Girl and Cautions as if she was my SisterThese my dear Miss and my honoured Father and Mother are the pleasant Imployments of our Time so far as we Females are concern'dfor the Gentlemen hunt ride out and divert themselves in their way and bring us home the News and Occurrences they meet with abroad and nowandthen a straggling Gentleman they pick up in their Diversions And so I shall not inlarge upon these Articles after the tedious Specimens I have given already Yet the Particulars of one Conversation possibly I may give you another Time when I have least to do because Three young Ladies Relations of Mrs  Towers  and Mrs  Arthur  were brought to visit me for the Benefit of my Instructions for that was the kind Compliment of those Ladies to me  WEDNESDAY  COULD you ever have thought Miss that Husbands have a Dispensing Power over their Wives which Kings are not allowed over the Laws I have this Day had a smart Debate with Mr  B  and I fear it will not be the only one upon this Subject Can you believe that if a Wife thinks  a Thing her Duty to do and her Husband does not approve of her doing it he can dispense with her performing it and no Sin shall lie at her Door Mr  B  maintains this Point I have great Doubts about it particularly one that if a Matter be my Duty and he dispenses with my Performance of it whether even altho' that were to clear  me  of the Sin it will not fall upon  himself  And to be sure Miss a good Wife would be as much concern'd at this as if it was to remain upon  her  Yet he seems set upon it What can one doDid you ever hear of such a Notion before Miss Of such a Prerogative in a Husband Would you care to subscribe to it This is one of Mr  B  's Particularities He has several of them the Effects as I take it of his former too free Life Polygamy as I have mentioned heretofore is another That is a bad one indeed Yet he is not so determin'd on this as he seems to be on the other in a certain Case that is too  nice  for me at present to explain to you and so I might as well have taken no Notice of it as yetOnly the Argument was so present to my Mind Held within this Hour and I write a Journal you know of what passes But I will some time hence submit it at least to  your  Judgments my Father and Mother You are well read in the Scriptures and have gone thro' the Occasion often and both Mr  B  and I found our Arguments on Scripture tho' we are so different in our Opinions He says my Ladies are of his Opinion I'm afraid they are and so will not ask them But perhaps I mayn't live and other things may happen and so I'll say no more of it at present  For the Sequel of this Matter see  Vol IV p    THURSDAY  MY Lady urging me to procure her the Verses you also desire about the Love Quarrel I this Day prevailed upon Mr  B  to favour me with a Sight of them and he was so kind as to give us the following History of the Parties and the Quarrel  A fine Gentleman his Friend blest with an ample Fortune and extraordinary Qualities but not free from Faults as great as his Perfections principally with regard to Ladies was approved of by the Parents of a Lady beautiful as a  May  Morning tender and meek as a Lamband prudent and witty but so diffident that she had hardly a Will of her own which subjected her to Inconveniencies  The Gentleman made a Campaign as a Voluntier having a Fondness for the Miliary Life and no Inclination to marry but being slightly wounded and coming over to be cured and the Match being proposed their Fortunes very great on both Sides he so well approved the Proposal and the Lady fell so much in Love with him that it was in a manner concluded upon  The Lady's Uncle Sir  G K  a Man of a very waspish positive and sordid Temper to whose large Estate as well as her Father's the young Lady was Heiress opposes the Match it is put off to please him The Gentleman makes another Campaign Her Father dies mean time leaving Sir  G  her Guardian but with express Desire to see her marry'd to that Gentleman and no other Sir  G  endeavours to bring about another Match for the Lady with a Man of Quality notwithstanding his Brother's Desire but the Lady who had fixed her Affections on  the Gentleman rejects the Proposal And her Lover coming over at the End of the Campaign the Lady consents to perform her Father's Will a Will so conformable to her own Inclinations but would not fix the Day till he had made up with her Uncle and got his Consent which the old spiteful Knight was resolved not to give and for a great while the Gentleman not to ask despising the Knight and having a Spirit above suppling himself to an unworthy Mind for sordid Interest sake  At last however she prevails Her Lover with no good Will resolves to court Sir  George  who to have a Pretence to break the Matter off treats him with great Indignity setting his Servants to insult him This the young Gentleman resenting the Knight following him with Outrage to the Top of a Pair of Stairs he twirled him from Top to Bottom almost and sprain'd the Knight's Foot in the Fall and went away with Indignation  This being reported to the Lady who lived not at that Time with Sir  George  but at her paternal Seat and being greatly aggravated to her she flies to her Uncle resolves to break with her Lover and takes up her Residence with Sir  George  for a while the old Knight keeping up her Resentment and prevailing on her to refuse Access to the Man to whom she was betrothed believing poor Lady that her Affections were more in her own Power than she afterwards found them to her Sorrow For she carry'd the Point so far renouncing him thro' fresh Aggravations invented against him tho' indeed he had formerly given himself too great Liberties that he went abroad again giving her quite for lost and enter'd into other Engagements which made them both unhappy to the End of their Lives  This is the Introduction as briefly as I can give it now come the Verses in a Letter from the Lover when abroad to his Friend who knew the whole Transaction  Fain would'st thou O my Friend thou say'st in Verse  Have me my last short Interview rehearse  With  my MARIA  Once I thought her so  But can a Mind surcharg'd with so much Woe  Harmoniously in easy Numbers flow  But yet to shew your Pow'r and my Esteem  Hard tho' it be your Choice shall fix my Theme  By various Means in vain I'd oft essay'd  To see and pacify the angry Maid  With idle Tales still the malicious Knight  Keeps up her Wrath and hides her from my Sight  The more I beg the humbler I appear  The haughtier still's the too resenting Fair  Proud of her Pow'r she makes me meanly sue  Nor doubts to bring me to her Uncle's View  Thus barr'd Access I by a common Friend  My Innocence endeavour to defend  Our Friend reports her Temper fix'd I find  A way by Letter to express my Mind  The haughty Maid still with such Anger burns  The Seal unbroke the suppliant Scroll returns  What can I do I hate myself to find  Such vile unwonted Meanness in my Mind  For well thou know'st till so much Excellence  Engag'd my Soul I scorn'd dull Wedlock's Fence  And but I thought the Charmer met my Flame  Had never wish'd to propagate my Name  Is not this very insolent Miss Did he not deserve  some  Punishment But it seems he had a most noble Mind great and good Qualities tho' intermingled with bad ones as it is observable that those who have great Beauties of Mind have often great Defects and that Persons of Parts seldom commit  small  Faults You'll find however that one Reason tho' he puts it not ungenerously for his Pride of Spirit to the Lady is he thinks she loves him and that to be sure she did or else a Lady of her Virtue would not have been betrothed to him with her own Consent Thus he proceeds making her however more oblig'd to his Generosity than Affection as one would think  Now fearful that if I my former View  The savage military Life pursue  The charming Maid my Innocence too late  Appearing should lament her newborn Hate  And her soft Mind with Love's Extreme annoy'd  Unable to support her present Pride  Returning Love should feel and she should grieve  To find me gone and lost beyond Retrieve  Charge to herself the Ills that might attend  The vagrant Life of so sincere a Friend  Lest this should be the Case I write once more  And humbly her returning Love implore▪  Protest my Innocence beg to be heard  And claim but as I make it clear Regard  Then fix a Time for th' angry Fair to prove  The happy Impulse of rekindled Love  And vow if after that she hold her Hate  To quit my Suit and seek a kinder Fate  This I resolve myself if Speech deny'd  Humbly to offer at her Chariotside  Next Morn if she as usual shall repair  To the delightful Downs to take the Air  Accordingly I mount my Steed next Morn  About the Time she us'd the Meads t'adorn  The Fairone comes Submissive I approach  But Oh her watchful Dragon's in the Coach  "Good Morrow  Polly" John  more gently drive  "How can you thus my honest Nature grieve  "Too well you know your Pow'r But lovely'st Maid  "Sure you've not learnt your Tyrant Sex's Trade  "O let me not your Scorn the rather meet  "Because you see me prostrate at your Feet  "You know my Temper Long I cannot bear  "Hard Usage ev'n from You Once taught Despair  "I'm lost for ever  Be you ever lost  Who finds you next will find you to their Cost  Her Uncle interrupts Mean time I spy  I think Compassion in her downcast Eye  But yet the charming Maid makes no Reply  Her throbbing Breasts thought I her Mind confess  She sighs but would her struggling Sighs suppress  This way and that she looks with wild Amaze  And down her Cheeks a Pearl escaped strays  But soon alas this hopeful Dawn's o'ercast  The beamy Sunshine was too gay to last  Where are you Niece  Her sordid Uncle cries  Can he who'd murder me delight your Eyes  I saw her Temper hard'ning as I thought  And her full Mind with various Passions fraught  Still more and more insulted by the Knight  I fear'd to act some Rashness in her Sight  So fresh Offence t'avoid I in her Lap  With Air submissive the fond Letter drop  This the Lady as you'll hear throws out of the Coach To be sure as Things had proceeded between them in a Case of Betrothment and she had acknowleg'd her Love to him it was enough to provoke such a high SpiritAnd see how her Conduct surprises him  But can it be believ'd  I  saw'tThese Eyes  Beheld the Fair with Rage unwonted rise  Selfmov'd  The Act  her own  Mine the Reproach  Whirl it with wild Disdain from out the Coach  My Servant takes it upJudge my Surprize  Indeed I hardly could believe my Eyes  How art thou chang'd O charming Maid Canst thou  So soon forget what thou so late didst vow  Can idle Tales so much reverse my Fate  And so much Love so soon be turn'd to Hate  But yet I think Extremes can never last  The Maid's all SoftnessWhen this Storm is past  Her Error seen Love will again return  And then she'll with more gen'rous Ardor burn  This Rub surmounted sweet 'twill be to tell▪  The diff'rent Passions that our Bosoms swell  Sweet will it be to hear the Charmer own  Her faulty Wrath and in my Bosom moan  The Pangs she gave me promise future Guard  Against my Foes and all those Pangs reward  Once more I'll try But how or when or where  Can I have wish'd Access The House of Pray'r  When next she visits all serene her Mind  Hopeful for who not Mercy wants to find  The gracious God of Mercy Peace and Love  Propitious to her earnest Wishes prove  When she has offer'd up her Pray'rs to Heav'n  And hopes as she forgives to be forgiv'n  Here I'll present my self and once more try  If my Fate's fix'd and if I cannot spy  Some Rays relenting in her soften'd Eye  But if her usual Piety the Place  The Holy Service alter not the Case  Well may I then conclude no Hope is left  And that her Heart of Love to me's bereft  Well may I then my former Schemes pursue  And bid for ever Love and Her Adieu  When the next happy Sabbath set apart  To mend the Mind and purify the Heart  Oftwish'd arrives impatient I repair  With decent Equipage to th' House of Pray'r  As up the Ayle with Mind disturb'd I walk  I find our Diff'rence made the Gentry's Talk  See there for so they said the handsome 'Squire  See see his lovely Mistress all on Fire  See whisper they she cannot stand his Sight  O born to plague each other and delight  I take my Seat Sh' averts her Face Thought I  This sweet Emotion sure should give me Joy  She can't indiff'rent be much less can hate  The Man who can this soft Distress create  Well I forgive thee Charmer and I know  Too much of Love to make thee stoop too low  I see thou lov'st me still All all I fear  Is that vile Demon Uncle at thy Ear  He then gives a pretty Description of the Country Lads and Lasses at Church and ends it with a Reflection that shews had the Lady been less diffident of herself more diffident of those who hated her  Lover and had placed a greater Confidence in the Man she lov'd they might have been very happy together▪ for he could not surely have a bad Heart who could write thus It seems he was Patron of the Church Thus he says  I then look round and pleas'd behold the Swains  And guileless Nymphs whom no vile Action stains  I made  Polly  read this Piece to me to see I transcribed it right and when she came to this last Line she was cover'd poor Girl with Blushes Read that again  Polly    And guileless Nymphs  read she blushing and weeping  whom no  whom no  vile  vile  Action stains  With wholsome Cheeks and neat from Top to Toe  Trip to their Benches a delightful Row  And tho' as Patron I've an upper Seat  I join in Pray'r with them and God intreat  That at the last Account in the Great Day  When all Distinction's set aside I may  Be found as worthy and be bless'd as they  Then follow the Lines I gave you in a former Letter which will bear repeating  But Oh forgive me Heav'n if oft my Fair  Robs thee of my Devoir disturbs my Pray'r  Confounds my best Resolves and makes me prove  That she's too much a Rival in thy Love  But better Thoughts my happier Hopes suggest  When once this stormy Doubt's expell'd my Breast  When once this agitated Flame shall turn  To steadier Heat and more intensely burn  My dear  Maria  then thought I will join  And we one Heart one Soul shall all be thine  The Service ended oft in vain I watch  A sidelong Look or stollen Glance to catch  I'm glad thought I thyself thou  dar'st  not trust  Nor glance this Way for fear thou shouldst be just  To both our Passions But this open War  Take care my Fair thou carry'st not too far  Once could I think thy Sex in thee toostrong  Fair as thou art I could not bear it long  I see I must go first The stubborn Maid  Moves not her trembling Feet nor turns her Head  Meansoul'd Sir  George  I see thee as thou art  Thy rageswoln Face displays thy ranc'rous Heart  Trembling with Malice and a thousand Fears  Thou'rt safe beneath the Refuge of thy Years  The Charmer mine thou know'st and must my Fate  In doubtful Balance hang for thy Estate  And can the lovely Maid so sordid be  To bow herself and hope to supple me  To Views so meanEmpire itself can't have  Attractions strong enough my Mind t'enslave  If this must be the Case my Fair Adieu  I wo'not stoop thus lownot ev'n for You  I quit my Seat and ere I'm well aware  Bow to the Pew that holds th' averted Fair  Walk slowly down My Tenants in a Row  With grateful Blessings hail me as I go  For well thou know'st by no Rackrents opprest  They're honest to their Landlord and their Priest  The Meaning of this Mr  B  explain'd That it was the Gentleman's Custom whenever he granted or renewed a Lease which he always did without exacting a Fine of the Descendants of the old Tenants to the Estate to remind the Tenant that he lett him but Nine Parts of his Farm that he might think himself concern'd in Conscience to pay the Tenth where due A Method Mr  B  always takes on the like Occasions  As thro' the Porch to trifle Time I pass  Call by their Name each neighb'ring Lad and Lass  Ask honest  Roger  how my Godson thrives  If ready for his second CoatThe Wives  I see not of their Health inquireI know  What keeps 'em henceHa  William  i'n't it so  Increasing BlessingsAh your Honour's right  When was she brought to BedAt Ten last Night  What has God sent herOh a thumping Boy  Welcome the little StrangerGive her Joy  From me Tell her I'll not forget her  And ev'ry Day be sure you love her better  It seems Miss that if he stood not himself or procur'd not Gossips for the Christening of the Children of his poorer Tenants he always sent them a large rich Cake and good Store of Sugar Sack and October on the Occasion What pity such good Qualities had any Intermixtures  Now comes the haughty Maid led by the Knight  So late my Joy my Rapture and Delight  Her sullen Aspect well I see reveals  She cherishes Resentment thro' false Tales  And balances my Love in Passion's partial Scales  The tim'rous Knight conscious of his Deserts  Quits the fair Prize and to the Chariot starts  Her halfunwilling Hand I seize to lead  Her to her Chariot and thus whisp'ring plead  "O hear me  Polly  Shall the partial Knight  "Thy halfsoul'd Uncle banish me thy Sight  "Conscious of native Honour faithful true  "My Soul's highset and cannot meanly sue  "'Tis not my Happiness I wish alone  "In seeking thee but Heav'n's my Judge

"Faults black enough I own my Life have curst  "But Oh long since dear Maid thou'st known the worst  "Against myself I've always own'd the Truth  "And thou'st forgiv'n the Lapses of my Youth"  With Scorn she turns her lovely Face"No more  "Urge thy vain Suit But quit my ChariotDoor  "If e'er I wish'd thee well know now my Hate  "Exceeds my former LoveI'm fix'd as Fate"  "One Visit more permit If I not prove  "I'm greatly wrong'd for e'er renounce my Love  "I'd clear the Matter upIndeed I'm loth  "To take such Measures as may hurt us both  "When past Recall thou find'st my Innocence  "Thou'lt wish thou'dst heard me in my own Defence"  "Go where thou wilt so I ne'er see thee more  "Nor hear thy Name once mention'd in my Door  "I shall be happy"  "Happy may'st thou be  "Whatever Fate betides unhappy me  "In Twelve diurnal Suns if I not hear  "Thou'st chang'd thy Mind I surely disappear  "The Wand'rer then takes place and thou in vain  "Shalt wish th' unhappy Fugitive again"  With fix'd Disdain she to her Chariot flings  Draws up the Glass and leaves me with a thousand Stings  Adieu dear MaidMay ne'er returning Love  Give thee this Action rash to disapprove  Unhappy wilt thou be nor blame me for't  If thou th' Heroine still canst not support  I'll stay the promis'd Time But faintly burns  That Love which not in Twelve Days Space returns  Forgive my Friend this tedious Scrawl 'Tis hard  To quit the Subjects of our first Regard  Once Love takes place no other Subject shares  Our Thoughts For Love absorbs all other Cares▪  I turn about assume a sprightly Air  Salute the Gentry round to hide my Care  Haste to my Chariot with the Rev'rend Priest  With chearful Visage but with Heart opprest  The Gentry censure as they pass along  Th' unusual Scene nor less the rural Throng  Some sad Offence they cry must sure be meant  That so much Sweetness could so much resent  Some say 'Twas this some That Some lay't to Spite  But most agree to blame the ranc'rous Knight  But each young Lady does her Triumph show  That Lady  L  has brought his Pride so low  "Our Sex is well reveng'd" the Fairones cry  "Look to't how ye offend" Their Lovers by  The threat'ning Fan and the arch Look revere  And my unwonted Tameness justly jeer  Now my best Friend I'm got to Foreign Shores  I charge thee tell me not the Fair deplores  Her Rashness past that Love once more returns  In her soft Breast But that her Wrath still burns  Still hardens her dear Heart Believes m' Offence  And banishes my Love for ever thence  For Oh should she relent one Torment know  Now 'tis too late 'twould fill my Mind with Woe  Preserve her bounteous Heav'n conserve her free  From ev'ry Thought of Love and ev'ry Thought of me  Till you shall raise for her some finish'd Youth  Worthy if Man can be her Charms her Truth  Her Piety And may the Fairone see  Those many happy Years she hoped once with me  I expect Miss you will thank me for this Piece which is in no other Hand and was not so much as transcribed before by any body But Mr  B  was so obligingly kind to us both as to say He would deny nothing to me that he thought would enable me to give Miss  Darnford  Pleasure  FRIDAY  MR  H  and my Lord and Lady  Davers  and the excellent Countess of  C  having left us this Day a good deal to my Regret and as it seemed to their own the former put the following Letter  into my Hands with an Air of Respect and even Reverence  Dear good Madam  'I Cannot content myself with common Thanks on leaving yours and Mr  B  's hospitable House because of  that there  Affair which I need not mention and truly am  ashamed  to mention as I  have been  to look you in the Face ever since it happen'd I don't know  how it came about  but I thought but at first of  Joking  a little  or so  and seeing  Polly  heard me with more Attentiveness than I expected I was encouraged to proceed and  so  now I recollect it  came about    'But she is innocent for me and I don't know how  that  came about neither for we were out one Moonlight Night together in the Garden walking about and afterwards took a  Nap  of two Hours I believe in the Summerhouse in the little Garden being overpowered with Sleep for I would make her lay her Head upon my Breast till before we were aware we fell asleep together But before that we had agreed on what you discover'd  'This is the whole Truth and all the Intimacies we ever had  to speak of  But I believe we should have been better acquainted had you not luckily  for me  prevented it by being at home when we thought you abroad For I was to come to her when she hemm'd  two or three times  for having made a Contract you know Madam it was natural enough to take the first Occasion to put it in Force  'She could not keep her own Secret and may have told you more perhaps than is true So what I write is to  clear myself  and to tell you how sorry I am in such a good House as yours and  where there is so much true Godliness that I should ever be  drawn away  to have a Thought to dishonour it But I will take care of being overfamiliar for the future with  Underlings  for see how a Man may be  taken in  If she had resented it at first when I began to kiss her  or so  for you know we young Fellows will take Liberties sometimes where they don't become us to our own Disparagements chiefly  that's true  I should have had an  Awe  upon me or if she had  told you  or but  said  she would I should have  flown  as soon as had any Thoughts further about  the matter  But what had one of our Sex to do  you know  Madam when they find  little  Resistance and that she would  stand quietly  and  tell no Tales  and make no  great Struggle  and not keep out of  one's Way  neither but to  dillydally on  till one brought it to more than one at first intended  'Poor  Polly  I pity her too Don't think the worse of her dear Madam so as to turn heraway because it may be her Ruin I don't desire to see her  I  might have been  drawn in  to do strange foolish things and been ruin'd at the long Run for who knows where this thing might have ended My  Uncle  would have never seen me My  Father  too his Lordship you know Madam is a very  cross Man  and never lov'd  me much  might have cut off the Intail My  Aunt  would have despis'd me and scorn'd me I should have been her foolish Fellow in  Earnest  not in  Jest  as now  You  would have resented it and Mr  B  who knows might have called me to Account for he is bloody  passionate  I saw that at the Hall and has fought two or three Duels as I have heard for abusing the  Freedom of his House  and breaking the Laws of Hospitality as you told me and so it is not unlikely I might have dy'd  like a Dog in a  Ditch  and there would have been an End of a noble Family that have been Peers of the Realm Time out of Mind What a sad thing would this have been A  publick  as well as  private  Loss For you know Madam what my Lady Countess said and nobody says better things or knows more of the Matter than her Ladyship That every Peer of the Realm is a Jewel in the Crown A fine Saying God grant I may keep it in Mind when my  Time comes  and my Father shall  happen to die  'Well but good Madam can you forgive me You see how happy I am in my Disappointment But I must take another Sheet of Paper I did not think to write so much for I don't love it But on this Occasion know not how to leave off I hope you can read my Letter I know I write a  clumsy  Hand and  spell most lamentably  for I never had a Talent for these things I was readier by half to admire the  Orchardrobbing Picture  in  Lily  's Grammar than any other Part of the Book Excuse my Nonsense Madam But many a time have I help'd to fill a  Satchel  and always supposed that Picture was put there on purpose to tell Boys what Diversions are  allowed  them and are  proper  for them Several of my Schoolfellows took it for granted as well as I and we could never reconcile it to our Reason why we should be punished for  practising  a Lesson  taught  us by our Grammars  'But hey whither am I running I never writ to you before and never may again unless you or Mr  B  command it for your Service So pray excuse me Madam  'I know I need give no Advice to  Polly  to take care of  first  Encouragements Poor Girl she might have suffer'd sadly as well as I For if my Father and my Uncle and Aunt had requir'd  me to turn her off you know it would have been undutiful to have refus'd them notwithstanding our Bargain And Want of Duty to them would have been to have added Fault to Fault As you once observed I remember that one Fault never comes alone but draws after it generally five or six to hide or vindicate it and  they  every one perhaps as many more  each    'I shall never forget several of your wise Sayings I have been vex'd may I be  hang'd  if I have not many a time that I could not make such Observations as you make who am so much  older  too and a  Man  besides and a  Peer's Son  and a  Peer's Nephew  But my Talents lie  another way  and by that time my Father dies I hope to improve myself in order to  cut  such a Figure as may make me be no Disgrace to my  Name  or  Country  for I shall have one Benefit over many young Lords that I shall be more fond of making  Observations  than  Speeches  and so shall improve of course you know  'Well but what is all this to the Purpose I will keep close to my Text and that is to thank you dear Madam for all the Favours I have received in your House to thank you for disappointing me and for convincing me in so  kind  yet so  shaming  a manner how wrong I was in the Matter of  that Polly  and for not exposing my Folly to any body but  myself  for I should have been ready to  hang  myself if you had and to beg your Pardon for it and to assure you that I will never offer the like as long as I breathe I am Madam with the greatest Respect  'Your most obliged most faithful and 'most obedient humble Servant  'J H  'Pray excuse Blots and Blurs'  Well Miss  Darnford  what shall we say to this fine Letter You'll allow it to be an Original I hope Yet maybe not For how does one know but it may be as well written and as sensible a Letter as this Class of People generally write But what then shall we be able to say for such poor Creatures of our Sex as are  taken in  as Mr  H  calls it by such pretty Fellows as this who▪ if they may happen to write better hardly think better or design to act better and are not so soon brought to Repentance and Promises of Amendment  Mr  H  dresses well is not a contemptible Figure of a Man laughs talks where he can be heard and his Aunt is not presentand  cuts  to use his own Word a considerable Figure in a Country Town But see Yet I will not say what I might He is Lord  Davers  's Nephew and if he makes his  Observations  and  forbears  his  Speeches  I mean can be silent and only laugh when he sees somebody of more Sense laugh and never  approve  or  condemn  but in  Leadingstrings  he may possibly pass in a Croud of Gentlemen But poor poor  Polly Barlow  What  can  I say for  Polly Barlow  I have a Time in View when possibly my Papers may fall under the Inspection of a dear Gentleman to whom next to God I am accountable for all my Actions and Correspondencies so I will either write an Account of the Matter and seal it up separately for Mr  B  or at a proper Opportunity will break it to him and let him know under Secrecy if I can engage him to promise it the Steps I took in it for fear something should arise hereafter when I cannot answer for myself to render any thing dark or questionable in it A Method I believe very proper to be taken by every marry'd Lady and I presume the rather to say so having had a good Example for it For I have often thought of a little  seal'dup Parcel of Papers my Lady made me burn in her Presence about a Month before she dy'd They are  Pamela  said she such as I have no Reason to be concern'd about let who will see them could they know the Springs and Causes of them But for Want of a Clue my Son might be at a Loss what to think of several of those Letters were he to find them in looking over my other Papers when I am no more  Let me add that nothing could be more endearing than our Parting with our noble Guests My Lady repeated her Commands for what she often engaged me to promise that is to say to renew the Correspondence begun between us so much as she was pleased to say to her Satisfaction  I could not help shewing her Ladyship who was always inquiring after my Writing Imployment most of what pass'd between you and me Miss and she admires you much and wish'd Mr  H  had more Wit that was her Word She should in that Case she said be very glad to set on Foot a Treaty between you and him  But that I fansy can never be tolerable to you and I only mention it  en passant  There's a  French  Woman for you  The Countess was full of her kind Wishes for my Happiness and my Lady  Davers  told me That if I could give them timely Notice she would be present on a  certain  Occasion  But my dear Miss what could I say I know nothing of the MatterOnly that I am a sad Coward and have a thousand Anxieties which I cannot mention to any body  But if I have such in the honourable Estate of Matrimony what must those poor Souls have who have been seduced and have all Manner of Reason to apprehend that the Crime shall be followed by a  Punishment so  natural  to it A Punishment  in kind  as I may say which if it only ends in Forfeiture of Life following the Forfeiture of Fame must be thought merciful and happy beyond Expectation for how shall they lay Claim to the Hope that is given to Persons in their Circumstance that  they shall be saved in Childbearing  since the Condition is  if they  CONTINUE  in Faith and Charity and  HOLINESS  with  SOBRIETY  Now my honoured Mother and my dear Miss since I am upon this affecting Subject does not this Text seem to give a comfortable Hope to a virtuous Woman who shall die in this Circumstance that she shall be happy in the Divine Mercies For the Apostle in the Context says That he  suffers not a Woman to teach nor to usurp Authority over the Man but to be in Silence  And what is the Reason he gives Why a Reason that is a natural Consequence of the Curse on the first Disobedience that she shall be in Subjection to her Husband For says he  Adam was  NOT  deceived but the Woman being deceived was in the Transgression  As much as to say  "Had it not been for the Woman  Adam  had kept his Integrity and therefore her Punishment shall be as it is said  I will greatly multiply thy Sorrow in thy Conception In Sorrow shalt thou bring forth Children and thy Husband shall rule over thee  But nevertheless if thou shalt not survive the Sharpness of thy Sorrow thy Death shall be deemed to be such an Alleviation of thy Part of the intailed Transgression that thou shalt  be saved  if thou hast CONTINUED in Faith and Charity and HOLINESS with SOBRIETY"  This my honoured Parents and my dear Friend is  my  Paraphrase and I reap no small Comfort from it when I meditate upon it  But I shall make you as serious as myself and my dear Miss perhaps frighten you from entering into a State in which our poor Sex suffer so much from the Bridal Morning let it rise as gayly as it will upon a thoughtful Mind to that affecting Circumstance throughout its whole Progression for which nothing but a tender a generous and a worthy Husband can make them any Part of Amends And when one  is  so bless'd one has so many Fears added to one's Sorrows and so much Apprehension thro' human Frailty of being separated from so beloved a Partner that a body had need of all one's Fortitude to support one's self But maybe I am the weakest and most apprehensive of my Sex Maybe I am And when one sees how common the Case is and yet how few die in it how uneasy many Ladies are  not  to be in this Circumstance my good Lady  Davers  particularly at times and  Rachel  and  Hannah  in Holy Writ and then how a childless Estate might lessen one in the Esteem of one's Husband one ought to bring these Considerations in Balance and to banish needless Fears And so I will if I can  But a Word or two more as to the parting with our honoured Guests I was a little indispos'd and my Ladies would excuse me against my Will from attending them in the Coach some Miles which their dear Brother did Both Ladies most tenderly saluted me twice and thrice apiece folding their kind Arms about me and wishing my Safety and Health and charging me to  think  little and  hope  much for they saw me thoughtful at times tho' I endeavoured to hide it from them  My Lord  Davers  was pleased to say with a Goodness of Temper that is his Peculiar My dearest dear Sister May God preserve you and multiply your Comforts I shall pray for you more than ever I did for myself tho' I have so much more need  of itI  must  leave youBut I leave a Lady that I love and honour next to Lady  Davers  and ever shall  Mr  H  looked conscientiously sillyI can say nothing Madam but saluting me that I shall never forget your Goodness to meAdding in his frothy Way Now can I say I have saluted an Angel if ever there was an Angel on Earth  I had before in Mrs  Jervis  's Parlour taken Leave of Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  my Lady's Women They each stole as it were at the same time a Hand of mine and kissed it begging Pardon as they said for the Freedom But I answer'd taking each by her Hand and kissing her I shall always think of you with Pleasure my good Friends for you have encouraged me constantly by your Presence in my private Duties And may God bless you and the worthy Families you so laudably serve as well for your sakes as their own  They turned away with Tears and Mrs  Worden  would have said something to me but could not Only both taking Mrs  Jervis  by her Hand Happy happy Mrs  Jervis  said they almost in a Breath And happy happy I too repeated I in my Mrs  Jervis  and in such kind and worthy Wellwishers as Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  Wear this Mrs  Worden  wear this Mrs  Lesley  for my sake And I gave each of them a Ring with a Crystal and Brilliants set about it which my dearest Mr  B  had bought a Week before for this very Purpose for he has a great Opinion of both the good Folks and often praised their Prudence and their quiet and respectful Behaviour to every body so different from the Impertinence that was his Word of most Ladies Women who are Favourites  Mrs  Jervis  said I have enjoyed many happy Hours in your Conversation Mrs  Worden  and Mrs  Lesley  I shall miss you very much  I must endeavour said I taking her Hand to make it up to you my good Friend as well as I can And of late we have not had so many Opportunities together as I should have wished had I not been so agreeably engaged as you know So we must each try to comfort the other when we have lost I such noble and you such worthy Guests  Mrs  Jervis  's honest Heart before touched by the Parting shew'd itself at her EyesWonder not my good Friends said I to the two Gentlewomen wiping with my Handkerchief her venerable Cheeks that I always endeavour thus to dry up all my good Mrs  Jervis  's Tears and then I kissed her thinking of you my dear Mother and I was forced to withdraw a little abruptly lest I should be too much moved myself because I was going up to our noble Guests who had they inquired into the Occasion would perhaps have thought it derogatory tho' I should not to my present Station and too much retrospecting to my former  I could not in Conversation between Mr  B  and myself when I was gratefully expatiating upon the amiable Characters of our noble Guests and of their Behaviour and Kindness to me help observing that I had little expected from some  See  Vol II p  Hints which formerly dropt from Mr  B  to find my good Lord  Davers  so polite and so sensible a Nobleman  He is a very goodnatur'd Man reply'd Mr  B  I believe I might once or twice drop some disrespectful Words of him But it was the Effect of Passion at the Time and with a View to two or three Points of his Conduct in publick Life for which I took the Liberty to find fault with him and received very unsatisfactory Excuses One of  these I remember particularly was in a Conference between a Committee of each House of Parliament in which he behaved in a way I could not wish from a Gentleman so nearly ally'd to me by Marriage for all he could talk of was the Dignity of their House when the Reason of the Thing was strong with the other and it fell to my Lot to answer what he said which I did with some Asperity which occasioned a Coolness between us for some Time  But no Man makes a better Figure in private Life than Lord  Davers  especially now that my Sister's good Sense has got the better of her Passions and she can behave with tolerable Decency towards him For formerly  Pamela  it was not so the Violence of her Spirit making him appear in a Light too little advantageous either to his Quality or Merit But now his Lordship improves upon me every time I see him  You know not my Dear continued Mr  B  what a Disgrace a haughty and passionate Woman brings upon her Husband and upon herself too in the Eye of her own Sex as well as ours Nay even those Ladies who would be as glad of Dominion as she if they might be permitted to exercise it despise others who do and the Man  most  who suffers it  And let me tell you my  Pamela  said the dear Gentleman with an Air that shew'd he was satisfy'd with his own Conduct in this Particular that you cannot imagine how much a Lady owes to her Husband as well with regard to  her own  Peace of Mind as to  both  their Reputations however it may go against the Grain with her sometimes if he be a Man who has Discretion to keep her incroaching Passions under a genteel and reasonable Controul  How do you like this Doctrine MissI'll warrant you believe that I could do no less than drop Mr  B  one of my best Court'sies in Acknowlegement of my Obligation to him for so considerately preserving to me  my  Peace of Mind and  my  Reputation as well as  his own  in this Case  But after all when one duly weighs the Matter I can't tell but what he says may be right in the main for I have not been able to contradict him partial as I am to my Sex when he has pointed out to me Instances in the Behaviour of certain Ladies who like Children the more they have been humour'd the more humoursome they have grown which must have occasion'd as great Uneasiness to themselves as to their Husbands Will you excuse me Miss This is between ourselves for I did not own as much to Mr  B  For one should not give up one's Sex you know if one can help it for the Men will be as apt to impose as the Ladies to incroach I doubt  Well but here my honoured Father and Mother and my dear Miss  Darnford  at last I end my Journalwise Letters as I may call them our noble Guests being gone and our Time and Imployments rolling on in much the same manner as in the past Days of which I have given an Account  If any thing new or uncommon or more particularly affecting to me than usual occurs I shall not fail to trouble you with it as I have Opportunity But I have now my Correspondence with Lady  Davers  to resume and how shall I do about that Oh I can easily tell It is but trespassing a little on your indulgent Allowance for me my everdear Parents And you my dear Miss will find it a Relief instead of an Occasion for Regret to be eased of a great many Impertinencies which I write to you in my Heart's Confidence and in the  Familiarity of FriendshipBesides I shall have the Happiness of changing our PaperCorrespondence into personal Conversation with you when at  London  And what a sweet Change for me will that beI will end with the joyful Thought and with the Assurance that I am  My dearest Father and Mother  and bestbeloved Miss Your dutiful and affectionate  P B  LETTER XXXIX  My dear Miss  DARNFORD  I Hear that Mrs  Jewkes  is in no good State of Health I am very sorry for it I pray for her Life that she may be a Credit if it please God to the Penitence she has so lately assumed For if she die it will look discouraging to some thoughtless Minds who penetrate not the Methods Providence takes with its poor Creatures that as soon as she had changed her Manner of Living and was in a reformed State she was taken away Tho' 'tis certain that a Person is fittest to die when worthiest to live And what a Mercy will it be to her if she should  not  live long that she saw her Errors and repented before 'twas too late  Do my dear  good Miss  vouchsafe to the poor Soul the Honour of a Visit She may be lowspiritedShe may be too much sunk with the Recollection of past ThingsComfort with that Sweetness which is so natural to Miss  Darnford  her drooping Heart and let her know that I have a true Concern for her and give it her in Charge  to take care of herself and spare nothing that will administer either to her Health or Peace of Mind  You'll pardon me my dear Miss that I put you upon such an Office an Office indeed unsuitable from a Lady in your Station to one in hers but not to your Piety and Charity where a Duty so eminent as that of visiting the Sick and chearing the doubting Mind is in the Question  I know your Condescension will give her great Comfort and if she should be hastening to her Account what a Pleasure will it give such a Lady as you to have illuminated a benighted Mind when it was tottering on the Verge of Life  But I hope she will get the better of her Indisposition and live many Years a thankful Monument of God's Mercies and to do more Good by her Example in the latter Part of her Life than she may possibly have done Evil in the former  I know she will want no spiritual Help from good Mr  Peters  but then the kind Notice of so generally esteem'd a young Lady will raise her more than can be imagined for there is a Tenderness a Sympathy in the good Persons of our Sex to one another that while the best of the other seem but to act as in Office saying to one those Things which tho' edifying and convincing one is not certain proceeds not rather from the Fortitude of their Minds than the Tenderness of their Natures mingles from Sex to Sex with one's very Spirits thins the animal Mass and runs thro' one's Heart in the same lify Current I can't cloathe my Thought suitably to express what I  would  express giving Assurance as well as Pleasure in the most arduous Cases and brightening our misty Prospects till we see the Sun of Righteousness rising on the Hills of Comfort and dispelling the heavy Fogs of Doubt and Diffidence▪  This it is makes me wish and long as I do for the Company of my dear Miss  Darnford  O when shall I see you When shall I To speak to  Circumstance  it is  all  I  long for  and pardon my Freedom of Expression as well as Thought when I let you know in this Instance how  early  I experience the  ardent Longings  of one in the Way I am in  But I ought not to set my Heart upon any thing that is not in my own Power and which may be subject to Accidents and the Controul of others But let whatever Interventions happen so I have your  Will  to come I must be rejoiced in your kind Intention altho' your  Power  should not prove answerable  And now my dearest honoured Mother let me tell you that I build no small Consolation in the Hope that I shall on a certain Occasion have your Presence and be strengthened by your Advice and Comfortings For this was a Proposal of the best and most considerate of Gentlemen who is every Day if he but sees the least Thoughtfulness upon my Brow studying to say or to do something to dispel it But I believe it is the grateful Sense I have of his Goodness to me that makes me thus overanxious For the Apprehensions of a Separation from such an excellent Husband from Hopes so chearing Prospects so delightful must at times affect one let one's Affiance and Desires be ever so strong where they ought to be preferably placedThen one  would  live to do a little more Good if one  might  I am a sad weak apprehensive Body to be sure I am How much better fitted for the Contingencies of Life are the gay frolick Minds that think not of any thing before it comes upon them than such thoughtful FuturityPokers as me  But why should I trouble you my honoured and dear Friends with my idle Fears and Folliesjust as if nobody was ever in my Circumstance before Yet weak and apprehensive Spirits will be gloomilyaffected sometimes and how can one help itAnd if I may not hope for the indulgent Soothings of the best of Parents and of my Miss  Darnford  in whose Bosom besides can one disburden one's Heart when oppressed by too great a Weight of Thought  You  will  come and be in the House with me my dear Mother for some Time when my best Friend sends to youWon't youAnd you will  spare  my dear Mother my best of Fathers Won't you Yes yes I am sure ye will And I am sure my Miss  Darnford  will be with me if she can and these are my Comforts But how I run onFor I am so much a Novice that  But I will say no more than that I am my honoured Father and Mother your everdutiful Daughter and my dear Miss  Darnford    Your affectionate and obliged  P B  The  END  of  VOL III
