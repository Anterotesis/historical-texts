 THE DRAMA A POEM  LONDON Printed for J WILLIAMS NO Fleet Street MDCCLXXV  DEDICATION To ARTHUR MURPHY  Esq  SIR  THOUGH I cannot boast the Honour of a personal acquaintance with you yet it would be passing the severest Censure on myself to declare I had not that intellectual one which the world in general claim with Men of distinguished Abilities I will not trespass on your Delicacy by giving Vent to the Fullness of my Admiration or by repeating what is already  universally known and acknowledged I only solicit your Patronage for the feeble Offspring of a friendless Muse conscious I cannot lay it before a better Judge than you Sir whose Writings have been so long the Prop and Ornament of the DRAMA and that if any thing can give it shelter it must be the protecting Influence of your Name  I have the Honour to remain  SIR  Your most humble and obedient Servant THE AUTHOR  THE DRAMA  SEVERE his task in these degen'rate days  Who rashly dares to grasp one sprig of Bayes  The frown of censure and pale envy's blight  Long damp his ardour and retard his flight  In form of critic lo where link'd they stand  With pride and dulness fix'd on either hand  Pointing with rugged thorns the painful steep  They ne'er ascend tho' round it doom'd to creep  Not so when Greece and Rome aspir'd to fame  Then critic and sound judgment were the same  The poet sought the gen'rous critic's aid  And the same laurel gave them both a shade  With all the terrors beating at my heart  A novice feels in first essays of art  With greatest homage for superior powr's  Trembling I seek the muse's sacred bow'rs  Sentenc'd in fancy ere my fate be known  As Churchill's theme I've rashly made my own  Mistaken zeal with folly at her side  Oft has the Drama and its sons decri'd  Gave the profession faults which nature knew  And judg'd the many from an erring few  Strictures like these for laughter only call  From their own weakness they must quickly fall  Let railing bigots and let pedant fools  Of morals prate and precepts taught in schools  Such clouds dissolve at merit's dazzling ray  As mists are melted by the eye of day  Shall he whose quick'ning animated frame  Electric like collects the poet's flame  Whose glowing breast feels ev'ry passion roll  And yields a body to great Shakespear's soul  Gives him each ornament of art and grace  And holds his mirror up to nature's face  Not gain the meed of wellearn'd honest fame  GARRICK step forward and assert your claim  Here charm'd attention could for ever wait  Fixt on thy beauties unconfin'd as great  And wrapt in visions of thy magic skill  Indulge the transports which my bosom fill  But what tho' language were to feeling true  Expressing strongly all in thought I view  What could it add O GARRICK to thy name  Already foremost on the lists of fame  Warm'd I may tell as diff'rent masks he wears  We shake with laughter or dissolve in tears  Dwell on his spirit judgment taste and grace  And the keen light'nings flashing from his face  But once behold the wonders of his art  You'll find those drawn by nature on your heart  To point his excellence or speak his praise  But stamps fresh value on the poet's lays  Next on the line yet distant BARRY stands  And takes precedence of the tragic bands  Nor does presumption only prop his claim  Once genius warm'd him with her finest flame  In love's soft transports or its wasting care  I feel each rapture ev'ry pang I share  If in the Moor by wildest passions prest  Who does not find the storm assail his breast  Now worn with years and almost quench'd his beam  He faintly glimmers like the embers gleam  Yet in the sparks of his expiring light  Proves that the blaze which fir'd him once was bright  Thus the grand column or majestic dome  Rear'd in the splendor of old Greece or Rome  Tho' broke with tempests and by time decay'd  Retain a greatness e'en in ruins laid  Tho' weak the million and to judge unfit  Still custom dubs them arbiters of wit  Their breath alone 'tis swells the trump of fame  And sounds the poet's or the sage's name  Severe decree and most the actor's bane  Whose art is tried by folly's giddy train  This MACKLIN felt tho' merit's sterling seal  Long pass'd him current in theatric scale  Grant him unequal to his daring aim  Did former service no indulgence claim  Too high ambition might have soar'd for praise  But yet 'twas mingled with a wish to please  Thus far humanity and justice plead  Now let us speak as taste and candour lead  Dark was his col'ring but conception strong  If hard his manner still it ne'er was wrong  Warm'd with the poet to the part he rose  His anger fir'd us and his terror froze  And more where quaintness shut out meaning's day  MACKLIN threw light with fine discernment's ray  If these are truths which envy's self must breathe  Applause should crown him with her greenest wreath  Where on her native quarry next to light  Shall the muse bend her melancholy flight  Now half her sons are swept by death's fell pow'r  And scarce a gleam of hope remains of more  O sacred fire which once with active heat  In POWELL's and in MOSSOP's bosoms beat  Where art thou fled or dost thou only rest  In GARRICK's and in BARRY's feeling breast  No replies genius I have found a part  A favourite mansion in a female heart  Where steady judgment and fine taste prepare  Their richest off'rings to detain me there  Behold where beauty in the shape of grace  With sweetness beams from BARRY form and face  There I reside enamour'd of the seat  Heedless of envy or ambition's cheat  And ne'er will quit her 'till my rival time  Shall ravish life as well as youth and prime  A handsome figure with an easy mien  Are all SMITH's requisites to fill the scene  Flat without compass drawling on the ear  In one dull tone th'unvaried voice we hear  No flame of passion ever yet he knew  Or changing character appear'd once new  Person alone first gave him to the stage  And habit guards him in this easy age  REDDISH wants pow'r th'emotion strong to raise  But his attention gains and merits praise  Tho' voice and feeling small assistance lend  He oft has pleas'd and seldom does offend  Unless when folly fain would have him great  And rant and stare usurp expression's seat  O how it moves me to the taunting jibe  To hear some groundling of th'itin'rant tribe  York Bath or Norwich rank with DRURY's scene  Now Frodsham's gone and Inchbald has been seen  What tho' their Lee boasts some faint strokes of art  Does he e'er touch with sympathy the heart  Where is that grace that station which commands  Applause's tribute with her hundred hands  His person's vulgar his deportment's bad  And tame correctness all he ever had  Hibernia whence the stage recruits her force  Has just sent LEWIS to the Thespian course  Bless'd with those happy requisites to please  A person spirit elegance and ease  How cold shone Belcour before LEWIS came  'Twas he restor'd him to the poet's flame  Passions like his such genuine active fire  May claim indeed the god of day for sire  BENSLEY has little save what art supplies  For stepdame nature almost all denies  Gloom shades his aspect discord's in his tone  His joy's as grating as his tragic moan  Yet such a charm can industry impart  Aided by worth and merit of the heart  That he stands higher on dramatic line  Than he whose talents more than virtues shine  Of all her suitors in the Thespian art  Thalia holds KING nearest to her heart  Fix'd in his eye the smiling goddess sits  And thence deals laughter with its loudest fits  Ease and indulgence oft at merit's throne  Prefer'd their plea and claim'd him as their own  Their wish obtained Thalia then appear'd  Struck with a danger which she long had fear'd  Her sister's sables and her tears she wore  To woo the truant to her arms once more  Subdu'd the lover's fondness stood confest  And clasp'd his weeping mistress to his breast  Vow'd to be constant to the suppliant maid  Till death dissolv'd the union nature made  That part an actor in the bloom of life  Plays with success he takes to him for wife  Simpers and ogles with a wither'd face  And trips the beau with antiquated grace  Tho' WOODWARD once might boast of sprightly ease  And ev'ry frolic wantonness to please  Why must he gambol after youth is fled  And winter scatters hoar upon his head  Still there's a cast his talents to employ  Razor or Bobadil can never cloy  When partial nature gifts a fav'rite son  With more than toiling art had ever won  Should not the muse if sloth the bounty mar  Censure the culprit who neglects her care  SHUTER tho' bless'd with humour's richest vein  And skill to reach the highest comic strain  Forgets his patroness and slights her boon  And when he wants his part becomes buffoon  As folly's offspring sport in fashion's glare  Flutt'ring in silks with wellbred shrug and stare  The insect tribe DODD paints with nicest art  And gives a double edge to satire's dart  Nature has dealt to CLINCH with lib'ral hand  Talents which cultur'd might applause command  But vain the grant and slow must rise his fame  Unless the manager will fan the flame  BRERETON has person is not void of grace  But wants the energy of voice and face  In gay description or in polish'd ease  His taste and judgment never fail to please  And when by time he's ripen'd on the bow  He'll merit that success he wishes now  Let those whom pride attract not sense and choice  Expire in raptures at an eunuch's voice  And feigning transports which they never felt  At unintelligible nonsense melt  For me a plain rough honest Briton bred  Who oft have err'd but by my heart was led  Who tho' a monarch shou'd his favours heap  Dare spurn at folly and at op'ra sleep  I call on VERNON if a sound must feast  To stamp it with the currency of taste  Few can like BANNISTER with humour strong  Do equal justice both to wit and song  And could the muse award the mimic praise  FOOT would not stand much higher in her lays  Faint as a shadow CAUTHERLEY glides by  And melts without impression on the eye  When DIBDIN's boast was a composer's name  He stood the rival of the author's fame  Till seiz'd with madness not poetic fire  He rashly dar'd himself to touch the lyre  When Phoebus shock'd at discord not his own  Gave him to censure with her hiss and groan  A greater bard on MOODY's brow has plac'd  A wreath with which it ever must be grac'd  Conscious I cannot give increase of bays  I'll add at least my humble meed of praise  QUICK wants not parts but SHUTER is the sun  Round which he moves and borrows all his fun  In the harsh parent or the rustic boor  DUNSTALL and PARSONS shew strong comic pow'r  PALMER gives spirit to the sprightly scene  By gay deportment and a pleasing mien  But when he woos the tuneful queen of tears  His accents wound the muse's finer ears  Shock'd at the sound we scarcely can believe  That the same man cou'd ever pleasure give  Without an effort WESTON gains applause  Nature has made him what the poet draws  Others with trick and stage manoeuvre aim  To strike the groundlings and their clap obtain  Shew Johnson's Drugger skill'd in Broughton art  And Scrub instead of fool a downright smart  But he superior to such paltry aid  Ne'er makes a jest but what his author made  True humour free from taint of low grimace  Or wild distortion sits upon his face  Tho' laughter shake unconscious he receives  The echoing plaudit public favour gives  LEWES in Marlow makes his audience feel  That he has head and heart as well as heel  The needy emigrant from Gallia's shore  The butt of ridicule since time of yore  Who struts in frippery and tinsell'd stuff  And jabbers nonsense as he scoops up snuff  BADD'LY with humour's pencil strongly draws  And meets as he deserves with warm applause  Cold and unmeaning AICKIN fills a part  And never gains the head or moves the heart  With jointed sound proceed his jarring tones  Like currents harsh and broke with beds of stones  His acting's vappid it wants feeling's soul  To warm and quicken into life the whole  HULL's always perfect and displays an aim  To catch the poet's spirit and his flame  At times he soars beyond chill medium's line  And shews some sparks of excellence that shine  What numbers censure but how few judge right  On subjects which demand the soul's keen sight  Each puny witling from stark folly vain  Dares JOHNSON's talents or a SWIFT's arraign  Merit by malice not with taste they scan  And damn the art because they hate the man  'Tis certain MELMOTH has not gain'd that height  On which perfection seated drops her flight  His person too wants weight but then his heart  Springs in his words and animates each part  Apollo pleads his cause and dare the muse  To hear her prince and patron's voice refuse  WROUGHTON has person and conception just  But wants strong feeling to be rank'd as first  A happy aspect and a wish to please  Deserve at least if not extort our praise  When surly winter with his felon train  Flies to some cavern on the howling main  And blooming summer leads the sprightly hours  Then FOOTE collects his vagrant sactter'd pow'rs  Poet and manager at once he stands  And starts upon the town his motley bands  'Tis rash to censure where the public praise  Gives to the actor and the author bays  But sure applause should never be his meed  Who sports with faults which weyward fate decreed  Who breaks that tye which binds each noble breast  And stabs his friend before he'll lose his jest  Success is giddy as the veering blast  And when it is not just can never last  Tho' now the senseless rabble may esteem  The homefelt col'ring of his timewrought scene  Ages to come where poets should appeal  Will never laugh at what they cannot feel  Person and elegance are YATES's claim  They're her chief passports to the court of fame  Her action's moulded into grace and ease  And plaudits from the nicest judgement raise  Kindling she glows with all the po  s' fires  And strongly feeling ev'ry heart inspires  Still with a sigh too clearly we behold  The greatest spirit must with years wax cold  YOUNG's speaking's just her action too is right  Yet seem like nymphs in boddice lac'd too tight  What need so oft the close join'd hands to raise  Or bow like Bramin in his idol's praise  And then that stalk which Zanga well befits  But ne'er with grace on female softness sits  Yet spite of all her faults her merits shine  And prove her YATES's rival on the line  How shall I treat thee HARTLEY to preserve  That homage candour and the fair deserve  For sure if Venus chose a mortal mould  The radiance of her charms divine t'enfold  HARTLY had been the sacred envi'd seat  To which a goddess may indeed retreat  Beauty like charity a charm spreads wide  Veiling a multitude of faults beside  Spirit and grace BARSANTI I allow  And hope to see her what a POPE is now  MACKLIN has judgment solid taste refin'd  With every bright embellishment of mind  No charm or spells within her dimples lie  Or fluttering cupids ambush in her eye  Sheer merit only and the force of skill  First gained her trophies and maintain them still  No touch of harmony can strike the heart  With half that magic CATLEY's strains impart  But folly as if envious of her fame  With gesture vulgar and uncouth proclaim  That acting in a female should have grace  Or modesty at least to fill it's place  Of sterling humour GREEN has ample store  Perhaps e'en CLIVE was never blessed with more  Mark where in Heidleberg th' extreams of life  Like Groom and Peer are constantly at strife  Or else when Termagant with luckless hit  Stumbles on nonsense in her search for wit  And if a STANHOPE's precept have no weight  You'll own by laughter that her merit's great  No woman without beauty or great skill  Can or cou'd ever on the stage excell  That prop alone supports a MELMOTH's name  While the sad want prevents a MATTOCK's fame  If music's voice the throbbing breast can move  Or melting softness wake the soul to love  If mild expression beaming from a face  Where sweetness revels with resistless grace  Can cold attention into rapture warm  Behold in BADD'LY ev'ry pow'r to charm  What CLIVE was once POPE is as Churchill told  'Ere rip'ning time her talents cou'd unfold  Late may the stage lament her absent aid  And never till with equal genius paid  How few can ever reach that happy line  Where sense and spirit by their union shine  And softned into ease with nicest art  Assail at once the judgment and the heart  That rarest talent ABINGTON alone  Possesses in perfection all her own  What woman else with such a grace displays  The courtly manners and true polish'd ease  Her skill gives sanction to vain fashion's stare  And makes the critic even folly bear  Fresh crouds press forward on the muse's sight  But pass like shadows at th'approach of night  So when the Trojan future time t'explore  Sought the dusk limits of the Stygian shore  The Ghosts in throngs beset the Hero round  With feeble clamours and a shrieking sound  But when he stretch'd the fading forms to chase  Their bodies melt he grasps the vacant space  Yet still these nothings insolent and vain  Expect proud reason's sentence to obtain  Then mark my tale and weigh the moral well  If right conceiv'd 'twill folly's rudeness quell  The vain Florella once at pride's command  Sat for her portrait to a famous hand  The painter tried the utmost of his skill  But found it baffled by the object still  No trace of character or glow of heart  Flush'd on her face to strike the glance of art  In fruitless toil he saw his work must end  When mind and soul no inspiration lend  Then bade the fool some other artist try  Sick of the task and laid his pencil by  FINIS
