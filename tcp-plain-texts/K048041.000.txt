 THE CUB AT NEWMARKET  Price One Shilling  THE CUB AT NEWMARKET A TALE  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  PallMall  MDCCLXII  TO His ROYAL HIGHNESS EDWARD Duke of YORK  SIR  PERMIT me to take this method of thanking your Royal Highness for condescending to like the following Sketch Or in other Words permit me to let the World know that this same Cub has been laughed at by the Duke of YORKhas been read to your Royal Highness by the Genius himself and warmed by the immediate beams of your kind Indulgence  HAD I been able to conceal this I should have imagined that I had not the least Spark of the Enthusiasm of  Parnassus  in my CompositionTo be so deficient in Vanity which if I am not mistaken may be reckoned an inseparable Characteristic of a Poet  THIS Trifle SIR would not presume to interrupt you when engaged in matters of Consequence It only begs leave to pay it's Respects in an hour devoted to chearful Festivity  I wish your Royal Highness a long a merry and a happy Life and am  Your obliged Devoted Servant  PREFACE  THIS Tale iswhat very few Tales nowadays aretrue The Hero of it no other than the Author himself It was indeed  catching the  merriment  as it rose  for it was written in the Newmarket Coffee RoomIn which the Author being elected a member of the Jockey Club had the happiness of passing several sprightly goodhumoured EveningsJust when the whimsical Adventure happened which is here related  POETICAL Licence however and is it not right that it should be so has been taken Particularly in Justice to my own Person I must declare that a certain figure of Speech called by Rhetoricians Hyperbole or Exaggeration has been made pretty free with  MY Reasons for publishing it are twofold One is my own The other I borrowed from Lord SHAFTESBURY The former is without flattery the merit of the Poem  "Heydayto be surewhy this is Impudence without a Parallel"  says some Don Choleric or another  I cannot agree with you there Sir TestyPardon me Sirhear my Explanation These Verses have had the honour of being approved by those whose Taste it would be the highest Arrogance in me to call in question Now Sir what have you to say to that  THE latter is in order to let my friends have Copies of it which they may be in no danger of not being able to read And surely I may be rather excused for making the Press my Amanuensis than the noble Lord who might have had half a dozen Secretaries at his command If I have not already said enough fifty other reasons may be invented by my ingenious Readers  AND now for the CriticsPray good Gentlemen be quiet Do not apply your confounded Squares and Compasses to a Performance whose Beautyif it has anybut that you know is understoodconsists in a careless ease What have your grave Countenances to do hereIt is not  at all becoming in People of your Dignity and Consequence to keep company with  Cubs  What the Deuce can't a comical fellow take a hearty laugh but one of you  sage Philosophers  must clap on a pair of damnation Spectacles and stare him full in the Face in order to find out Pimples upon his Nose  COMMEND me however as much as you please Take full scope there And for your further encouragement if you will tickle my fancy with a few obliging encomiums I promise you a SCOTCHPINTBOTTLE of mine excellent Host  At the BEDFORDHEAD  WILDMAN's best Claret which by the by has been facetiously reckoned no ineffectual Bribe to one formidable  Bashaw  amongst you  JESTING apart My dear Boy CUB go alongpush thy wayshift for thyself All that is required of thee is to relax the Muscles of such as have not got these organs of risibility over and above constrictedPlay thy Part well and rest assured of eternal applause from thy loving PROGENITOR  THE CUB AT NEWMARKET  POETS for most part have been poor  Experience tells usProof too sure  "Ay may be so" Lord RICH exclaims  Who Fortune's Will incessant blames  "It may be so but yet confound 'em  "They still have Jollity around 'em"  PRAY my good Lord'tis no Offence  To ask by rules of common sense  Is not this distribution right  At least I view it in that light  For 'tis but just that ev'ry Creature  Should have  some  favour from Dame Nature  RICH shrugs his shoulders"Why perhaps  "'Tis as you say"then sudden slaps  His fist upon his buffclad thigh  And surly grunts "Don't know not I  "But come don't you your Promise fail  "Do give us now that same new Tale  "Of Mirth'twill serve my spleen t' appease  "And set my troubled mind at ease"  I will my Lord but hope you'll make  Allowance for a Youngster's sake  "O never fear"Don't look so grim  You seem dispos'd my back to trim  That Cudgel looks so wondrous strong  'Twould sweep a dozen Tars along  "POH Poh this idle trifling nay  "Come Sir youdine with me today"  BRAVO my Lord Oh now I'm fee'd  Wise as a Lawyer I'll proceed  LORD E*******N who has you know  A little dash of whim or so  Who thro' a thousand scenes will range  To pick up any thing that's strange  By chance a curious CUB had got  On SCOTIA's Mountains newly caught  And after driving him about  Thro'  London  many a diff'rent rout  The comic Episodes of which  Would tire your Lordship's Patience each  Newmarket Meeting being near  He thought 'twas best to have him there  And that your Time I mayn't consume  View him in the  New CoffeeRoom  THERE soon his noble Patron gay  Flies to his sportive Friends away  While the Poor Being hums a song  Astonish'd to behold  a Throng  Of DUKES and LORDSBless me he thought  Enchantment surely here has wrought  SOMETIMES stockstill he stood amaz'd  And with a stupid wonder gaz'd  Admir'd at ev'ry thing he saw  Ev'n Spurs would his attention draw  Much more MILITIA COL'NELS GREAT  The Bulwarks of BRITANNIA's State  Whose strut majestic made him shrink  As on a Promontory's brink  In short size colour voice and shape  Made our  Prodigious Hero  gape  Such charms in Novelty we find  Such it's effect on ev'ry mind  SOMETIMES he with an awkard stride  Would lift his legs from side to side  While Stars reflecting Phoebus' light  With beamy radiance struck his sight  Then as his visive orbs grew dim  Began to think some look'd at him  And Bashfulness he knew not why  Brought tears into his sheepish eye  WHAT could the luckless fellow do  For not a single soul he knew  At last a corner pure and snug  He chanc'd to spy which made him hug  Himself with joyThere down he sat  Of Solitude fond as a Bat  And like a man at point of death  Scarcely squeez'd forth above his breath  "Here get me  Paper Pen and Ink  "For  Waiter  I will write I think"  AND now my Story pause awhile  Till I in  Hudibrastic  stile  Attempt to give you as I can  The Portraiture of this Wild Man  HE was not of the iron Race  Which sometimes CALIDONIA grace  Tho' he to Combat could advance  Plumpness shone in his Countenance  And Belly prominent declar'd  That he for Beef and Pudding car'd  He had a large and pond'rous head  That seem'd to be compos'd of lead  From which hung down such stiff lank hair  As might the crows in Autumn scare  TWO hours thus studious past or more  Afraid to venture on the floor  He rather thought on something new  Nor dreamt he any notice drew  SEDLEY a truly worthy Knight  In whom strong sense quick parts unite  Whose humour of peculiar cast  Surprizes you from first to last  Who tho' few really are more wise  To look a little foolish tries  And likes  Exotics  to discover  As a fine Lady a new Lover  To the consounded Put comes near  Tips him at once a friendly leer  And thus accosts him "How now Squire  "Why you've already wrote a Quire  "Yet still continue to go on  "What will your labours ne'er be done  "'Tis said that you and EGLINTOUN  "Our History are handing down  "No doubt 'twill be a Work compleat  "All former Authors will be beat  "Out with  Proposals  for my share  "I'll instantly subscribe I swear"  JUST in the moment as he spoke  The sprightly PEER with switch of oak  Popt in his nose"Faith good enough  "Sir CHARLES my friend You  Jockey  bluff  "We'll give you leaveno favour light  "Here to throw in a willing mite  "You to  Parnassus  who resort  "And the  Pierian  Ladies court  "Come touch us up a sketch in rhime  "And shew your geniusnow's the time  "To the best  The best Justice  Mr PN  JUSTICE in the Nation  "The Squire I meanmake Dedication  "And I who have a knack that way  "Will whistle Notes to what you say  "Nay more in attitude burlesque  "Will draw the  The Caliban  An Appellation sometimes merrily bestowed on a very sensible worthy Member who loves a jest himself and who admires the equitable Practice of  Give and Take  CALIBAN grotesque  "Who in the Frontispiece shall stand  "And ludicrous your mirth command"  THIS last Design was scarcely broach'd  When lo the MONSTER fell approach'd  The Justice in one arm he lugs  And the thin Spectre onward tugs  OUR CLOWN like country mouse of old  'Bout which in HORACE we are told  Quak'd timid as with horrid grin  He saw HIM shake his triple chin  Th' affrighted  Animal  would skulk  And hide him from th' ENORMOUS BULK  YOU'll easily believe  My Lord  That this could no small fun afford  And setnay call me not queer Dog  Their  Gelasticity  agog  AT first the circle held but few  Till as the loud laugh stronger grew  DUKES LORDS and COMMONS fondly join'd  Eager the mighty joke to find  Not one of 'em a sentence spoke  With peals of laughter like to choak  Each as he came th' infection seiz'd  And by his friend behind was teaz'd  With "What's the matter"All at once  The friend behind turns equal Dunce  IN short the Hounds when in full cry  Ne'er struck with so much force the sky  As this blithe Chorus did assault  The CoffeeRoom's resounding Vault  MEANTIME Sir CHARLES who  seem'd  to pry  Into the Jest with aspect sly  His visage veiling with a gloom  Slip'd to the middle of the room  Pull'd half a dozen by the sleeve  And whisper'd each "You may believe  "I'm forc'd to tell you what is true  "Why damn it Sir they laugh at  You  "  AND now my LordAnd now in end  To what does all this Story tend  IF you're so good as to allow  I'd willingly the Moral show  "Ha ha my Boy with all my heart  "You're now to play a serious part  "Wisdom to learn from such as you  "Is surely something very new"  YOUR Lordship here then may observe  That Nonsense frequently will serve  To set a table on a roar  And drive dull Sadness out of door  From whence that Folly is at least  Harmless I think should be confest  And that in life it may be well  Sometimes to hunt the  Bagatelle  LIKEWISE we see that Fate ne'er fails  To weigh things in impartial scales  For tho' some People are more blest  With Understanding than the rest  She some external Oddity  Bestows which they themselves can't see  Or some particular defect  Which while they indolent neglect  To Mortals of inferior sort  In harmless Satire serves for sport  THUS is the Ballance render'd even  Here view the equity of Heaven  FINIS
