 PAINE DUNDAS AND ONSLOW  A LETTER TO MR HENRY DUNDAS ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL SECRETARIES OF STATE AND TREASURER OF THE NAVY  IN ANSWER TO HIS SPEECH ON THE LATE  EXCELLENT  PROCLAMATION  ALSO TWO LETTERS TO LORD ONSLOW LORD LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY OF SURRY  BY THOMAS PAINE AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE A LETTER TO THE ABBE RAYNAL A LETTER TO THE MARQUIS OF LANSDOWN AND RIGHTS OF MAN  LONDON  PRINTED FOR L WAYLAND NO MIDDLEROW HOLBORN  TO Mr HENRY DUNDAS  SIR  London  June    AS you opened the debate in the house of Commons May th on the Pro∣clamation for suppressing Publications which that Proclamation without naming any calls wicked and seditious and as you applied those approbrious epithets to the works entitled "RIGHTS OF MAN" I think it unne∣cessary to offer any other reason for addressing this Letter to you  I begin then at once by declaring that I do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author ancient or modern on the subject of Government a spirit of greater benignity and a stronger inculcation of moral  principles than in those which I have published They come Sir from a man who by having lived in different countries and under different systems of Government and who being in∣timate in the construction of them is a bet∣ter judge of the subject than it is possible that you from the want of those opportunities can beAnd besides this they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile  I will further say that when that moment arrives in which the best consolation that shall be left will be that of looking back on some past actions more virtuous more meritorious than the rest I shall then with happiness re∣member among other things I have written the RIGHTS OF MANAs to what Pro∣clamations or Prosecutions or Placemen or Placeexpectantsthose who possess or those who are gaping for office may say of them it will not alter their character either with the world or with me  Having Sir made this declaration I shall proceed to remark not particularly upon your own Speech on that occasion but on any other Speech to which your Motion on that day gave rise and I shall begin with that of Mr ADAM  This Gentleman accuses me of  not  having done the very thing that  I have done  and which he says if I  had  done he should not have ac∣cused me  Mr ADAM in his Speech see the Morn∣ing Chronicle of May says  That he had well considered the subject of Constitu∣tional Publications and was by no means ready to say but the contrary that books of science upon Government though re∣commending a doctrine or system different from the form of our Constitution meaning that of England were fit objects of prose∣cution that if he did he must condemn which he meant not to do HARRINGTON for his Oceana SIR THOMAS MORE for his Eutopia and HUME for his Idea of a per∣fect Commonwealth But continued Mr Adam the Publication of Mr PAINE was very different for it reviled what was  most sacred  in the Constitution destroyed every principle of subordination and  established no∣thing in their room  I readily perceive that Mr ADAM had not read the  Second  Part of  Rights of Man  and I am put under the necessity either of submitting to an erroneous charge or of jus∣tifying myself against it and I certainly shall prefer the latterIf then I shall prove to Mr ADAM that in my reasoning upon Sys∣tems of Government in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  I have shewn as clearly I think as words can convey ideas a certain System of Government and that not existing in theory only but already in full and establish∣ed  practice and systematically and practically free from all the vices and defects of the Eng∣lish Government and capable of producing more happiness to the People and that also with an eightieth part of the Taxes which the present System of English Government consumes I hope he will do me the justice when he next goes to the House to get up and confess he had been mistaken in saying that I had  established nothing and that I had destroyed every principle of subor∣dination  Having thus opened the case I now come to the point  In the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN I have distinguished Government into two classes or systems the one the hereditary system the other the representative system  In the First Part of  Rights of Man  I have en∣deavoured to shew and I challenge any man to refute it that there does not exist a right to esta∣blish Hereditary Government or in other words Hereditary Governors because Hereditary Go∣vernment always means a Government yet to come and the case always is that the People who are to live afterwards have always the same right to chuse a Government for themselves as the people had who lived before them  In the Second Part of  Rights of Man  I have not repeated those arguments because they are irrefutable but have confined myself to shew the defects of what is called Hereditary Government or Hereditary Succession that it must from the  nature of it throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capaci∣tyJames the IId is recorded as an instance of the first of these cases and instances are to be found almost all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter  To shew the absurdity of the Hereditary Sys∣tem still more strongly I will now put the fol∣lowing caseTake any fifty men promis∣cuously and it will be very extraordinary if out of that number one man should be found whose principles and talents taken together for some might have principles and others have talents would render him a person truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of Na∣tional Trust If then such a fitness of cha∣racter could not be expected to be found in more than one person out of fifty it would happen but one in a thousand years to the eldest son of any one family admitting each on an average to hold the office twenty years Mr Adam talks of something in the Constitution which he calls  most sacred  but I hope he does not mean hereditary succession a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature and of common sense  When I look into History and see the mul∣titudes of men otherwise virtuous who have died and their families been ruined in defence of knaves and fools and which they would not  have done had they reasoned at all upon the system I do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind than to en∣deavour to break the chains of political super∣stition Those chains are now dissolving fast and proclamations and prosecutions will serve but to hasten that dissolution  Having thus spoken of the Hereditary Sys∣tem as a bad system and subject to every pos∣sible defect I now come to the Representative System and this Mr ADAM will find stated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man not only as the best but as the only  Theory  of Go∣vernment under which the liberties of a people can be permanently secure  But it is needless now to talk of mere Theo∣ry since there is already a Government in full practice established upon that Theory or in other words upon the Rights of Man and has been so for almost twenty years Mr Pitt in a speech of his some short time since said  That there never did and never could ex∣ist a Government established upon those Rights and that if it began at noon it would end at night  Mr Pitt is not yet arrived at the degree of a schoolboy in this species of knowledge His practice has been confined to the means of  extorting revenue  and hist boast has been  how much  Whereas the boast of the System of Government that I am speaking of is not how much but how little  The System of Government purely repre∣sentative unmixed with any thing of here∣ditary nonsense began in America I will now compare the effects of that system of Go∣vernment with the system of Government in England both during and since the close of the war  So powerful is the Representative System first by combining and consolidating all the parts of a country together however great the extent and secondly by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the Govern∣ment or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise that America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the schemes and projects of the Hereditary Government of England against her As the establishment of the Revolution and Independance of America is a proof of this fact it is needless to enlarge upon it  I now come to the comparative effect of the two Systems  since  the close of the war and I re∣quest Mr Adam to attend to it  America had internally sustained the ravage of upwards of seven years of war which En∣gland had not England sustained only the expence of the war whereas America sustained not only the expence but the destruction of property committed by  both  armies Not a house was built during that period and many thou∣sands were destroyed The farms and planta∣tions  along the coast of the country for more than a thousand miles were laid waste Her commerce was annihilated Her ships were ei∣ther taken or had rotted within her own har∣bour The credit of her funds had fallen up∣wards of ninety per cent that is an original hundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds In fine she was apparently put back an hun∣dred years when the war closed which was not the case with England  But such was the event that the same Re∣presentative System of Government though since better organized which enabled her to conquer enabled her also to recover and she now presents a more flourishing condition and a more happy and harmonized society under that system of Government than any country in the world can boast under any other Her towns are rebuilt much better than before her farms and plantations are in higher im∣provement than ever her commerce is spread over the world and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to upwards of one hundred and twenty Mr Pitt and his colleagues talk of the things that have hap∣pened in his boyish Administration without knowing what greater things have happened elsewhere and under other systems of Govern∣ment  I next come to state the expence of the two systems as they now stand in each of the  countries but it may first be proper to ob∣serve that Government in America is what it ought to be a matter of honour and trust and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre  The whole amount of the nett taxes in En∣gland exclusive of the expence of collection of drawbacks of seizures and condemnations of fines and penalties of fees of office of litiga∣tions and informers which are some of the bless∣ed means of enforcing them is seventeen mil∣lions Of this sum about nine millions go for the payment of the interest of the National Debt and the remainder being about eight millions is for the current annual expences Thus much for one side of the case I now come to the other  The expence of all the several departments of the general Representative Government of the United States of America extending over a space of country nearly ten times larger than England is two hundred and ninetyfour thou∣sand five hundred and fiftyeight dollars which at s d per dollar is l s sterling and is thus apportioned  Expence of the Executive Department     l  s  The Office of the Presidency at which the President receives nothing for himself      Vice President      Chief Justice      Five associate Justices      Nineteen Judges of Districts and Attorney General      Legislative Department  Members of Congress at six dollars l s per day their Secretaries Clerks Chaplains Messengers Doorkeepers c      Treasury Department  Secretary Assistant Comptroller Auditor Trea∣surer Register and LoanOfficeKeeper in each State together with all necessary Clerks OfficeKeepers c      Department of State including Foreign affairs  Secretary Clerks c c      Department of War  Secretary Clerks Paymaster Commissioner c      Commissioners for settling Old Accounts  The whole Board Clerks c      Incidental and Contingent Expences  For Firewood Stationary Printing c      Total      On account of the incursions of the Indians on the back settlements Congress is at this time obliged to keep six thousand militia in pay in addition to a regiment of foot and a battalion of artillery which it always keeps and this increases the expence of the War De∣partment to dollars which is l sterling but when Peace shall be concluded with the Indians the greatest part of this expence will cease and the total amount of the expence of Government including that of the army will  not amount to one hundred thousand pounds sterling which as has been already stated is but an eighteenth part of the expences of the English Government  I request Mr Adam and Mr Dundas and all those who are talking of Constitutions and blessings and Kings and Lords and the Lord knows what to look at this statement Here is a form and system of Government that is better organized and better administered than any Government in the world and that for less than one hundred thousand pounds per annum and yet every Member of Congress receives as a compensation for his time and attendance on public business one pound seven shillings per day which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year  This is a government that has nothing to fear It needs no proclamations to deter peo∣ple from writing and reading It needs no po∣litical superstition to support it It was by en∣couraging discussion and rendering the press free upon all subjects of Government that the principles of Government became understood in America and the people are now enjoying the present blessings under it You hear of no riots tumults and disorders in that country because their exists no cause to produce them Those things are never the effect of Freedom but of restraint oppression and excessive taxation  In America there is not that class of poor  and wretched people that are so numerously dis∣persed all over England and who are to be told by a Proclamation that they are happy and this is in a great measure to be accounted for not by the difference of Proclamations but by the difference of Governments and the dif∣ference of Taxes between that country and this What the labouring people of that country earn they apply to their own use and to the education of their children and do not pay it away in taxes as fast as they earn it to support Court extravagance and a long enor∣mous list of Placemen and pensioners and besides this they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing themselves and con∣sequently of respecting each other and they laugh at those imaginary beings called Kings and Lords and all the fraudulent trumpery of Courts  When Placemen and Pensioners or those who expect to be such are lavish in praise of a Government it is not a sign of its being a good one The pension list alone in England see Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue page of the Appendix is One Hundred and seven thousand Four Hundred and Four Pounds  which is more than the expences of the whole Government of America amount to  And I am now more convinced than before that the offer that was made to me of a Thousand Pounds for the copyright of the Second Part of the  Rights of Man  together with the remaining copyright of the First Part was to have ef∣fected by a quick suppression what is now at∣tempted to be done by a Prosecution The connection which the person who made that offer has with the King's Printing Office may furnish part of the means of enquiring into this affair when the Ministry shall please to bring their Prosecution to issue But to return to my subject  I have said in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  and I repeat it here that the service of any man whether called King President Se∣nator Legislator or any thing else cannot be worth more to any country in the regular rou∣tine of office than Ten Thousand Pounds per annum We have a better man in America and more of a Gentleman than any King I ever knew of who does not occasion even half that expence for though the salary is fixed at Five Thousand Two Hundred and SixtyFive Pounds he does not accept it and it is only the incidental expences that are paid out of it The name by which a man is called is of itself but an empty thing It is worth and character alone which can render him valuable for without these Kings and Lords and Presidents are but jingling names  But without troubling myself about Consti∣tutions of Government I have shewn in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  that an alliance  may be formed between England France and America and that the expences of Government in England may be put back to one million and an half viz  Civli expence of Government  £  Army    Navy         And even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expences of Government are in America and it is also greater than the whole peace esta∣blishment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago So much has the weight and oppression of Taxes encreased since the Re∣volution and especially since the year  To shew that the sum of l is suf∣ficient to defray all the civil expences of Go∣vernment I have in that work annexed the following estimate for any country of the same extent as England  In the first place three hundred Representa∣tives fairly elected are sufficient for all the purposes to which Legislation can apply and preferable to a larger number  If then an allowance at the rate of five hundred pounds per ann be made to every Re∣presentative deducting for nonattendance the expence if the whole number attended six months each year would be £  The Official Departments could not possibly exceed the following number with the sa∣laries annexed viz  Three Officers  at l each    Ten ditto  at l each    Twenty ditto  at each    Forty ditto  at l each    Two hundred ditto  at l each    Three hundred ditto  at l each    Five hundred ditto  at l each    Seven hundred ditto  at l each          £  If a Nation chose it might deduct four per cent from all the offices and make one of twenty thousand pounds per annum and style the person who should fill it King or Majes∣ty or Madjesty or give him any other title  Taking however this sum of one million and an half as an abundant supply for all the expences of Government under any form what∣ever there will remain a surplus of nearly six millions and an half out of the present Taxes after paying the interest of the National Debt and I have shewn in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  what appears to me the best mode of applying the surplus money for I am now speaking of expences and savings and not of systems of Government  I have in the first place estimated the poorrates at two millions annually and shewn that the first effectual step would be to abolish the poorrates entirely which would be a saving  of two millions to the housekeepers and to remit four millions out of the surplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in money in pro∣portion to the number of children in each fa∣mily and the number of aged persons  I have estimated the number of persons of both sexes in England of fifty years of age and upwards at and have taken onethird of this number viz to be poor people  To save long calculations I have taken of them to be upwards of fifty years of age and under sixty and the other to be sixty years and upwards and to allow six pounds per ann to the former class and ten pounds per ann to the latter The expence of which will be  Seventy thousand persons at l per ann    Seventy thousand persons at l per ann       £  There will then remain of the four millions l I have stated two different methods of appropriating this money The one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family at the rate of three or four pounds per ann for each child the other is to apportion it according to the expence of living in different countries but in either of these cases it would together with the allowance to be made to the aged completely take off taxes from onethird of all the families in England besides  relieving all the other families from the burthen of poorrates  The whole number of families in England lotting five souls to each family is one million four hundred thousand of which I take one third viz to be poor families who now pay four millions of taxes and that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other twothirds The plan therefore as stated in the work is first to remit or repay as is al∣ready stated this sum of four millions to the poor because it is impossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of collect∣ing taxes on articles of consumption and se∣condly to abolish the poorrates the house and windowlight tax and to change the Com∣mutation Tax into a progressive Tax on large estates the particulars of all which are set forth in the work and to which I desire Mr ADAM to refer for particulars I shall here content my∣self with saying that to a town of the population of Manchester it will make a difference in its favour compared with the present state of things of upwards of fifty thousand pounds annually and so in proportion to all other places through∣out the nation This certainly is of more con∣sequence than that the same sums should be collected to be afterwards spent by riotous and profligate courtiers and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter Tavern PallMall  I will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second Part of  Rights of Man  which Mr Dundas a man rolling in luxury at the expence of the nation has brand∣ed with the epithet of "wicked"  By the operation of this plan the poor laws those instruments of civil torture will be superseded and the wasteful expence of litigation prevented The hearts of the hu∣mane will not be shocked by ragged and hun∣gry children and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging for bread The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their last as a reprisal of pa∣rish upon parish Widows will have a main∣tenance for their children and not be carted away on the death of their husbands like culprits and criminals and children will no longer be considered as increasing the distresses of their parents The haunts of the wretched will be known because it will be to their advantage and the number of petty crimes the offspring of poverty and distress will be lessened The poor as well as the rich will then be interested in the support of Govern∣ment and the cause and apprehension of riots and tumults will cease Ye who sit in ease and solace yourselves in plenty and such there are in Turkey and Russia as well as in Eng∣land and who say to yourselves  are we not well off  have ye thought of these things  When ye do ye will cease to speak and feel for yourselves alone  Rights of Man Part II p  After this remission of four millions be made and the poor Rates and House and Window∣light Tax be abolished and the Commutation Tax changed there will still remain nearly one million and an half of surplus Taxes and as by an alliance between England France and America armies and navies will in a great measure be rendered unnecessary and as men who have either been brought up in or long ha∣bited to those lines of life are still citizens of a nation in common with the rest and have a right to participate in all plans of National benefit it is stated in that work Rights of Man Part II to apply annually l out of the surplus taxes to this purpose in the following manner  To fifteen thousand disbanded soldiers s per week each clear of deductions during life    Additional pay to the remaining soldiers per ann    To the officers of the disbanded corps during life the same sum of    To fifteen thousand disbanded sailors s per week during life    Additional pay to the remaining sailors    To the officers of the disbanded part of the navy during life       £  The limits to which it was proper to confine this letter will not admit of my entering into  further particulars I address it to Mr Dundas because he took the lead in the debate and he wishes I suppose to appear conspicuous but the purport of it is to justify myself from the charge which Mr Adam has made  This Gentleman as has been observed in the beginning of this Letter considers the writings of Harrington Moore and Hume as justifia∣ble and legal Publications because they reason∣ed by comparison though in so doing they shewed plans and systems of Government not only different from but preferable to that of England and he accuses me of endeavouring to confuse instead of producing a system in the room of that which which I had reasoned against whereas the fact is that I have not only reason∣ed by comparison of the Representative system against the Hereditary system but I have gone further for I have produced an instance of a Government established entirely on the Repre∣sentative system under which much greater hap∣piness is enjoyed much fewer Taxes required and much higher credit is established than under the system of Government in England The Funds in England have risen since the war only from l to l and they have been down since the Proclamations to l whereas the Funds in America rose in the mean time from l to l His charge against me "of destroying every principle of subordination" is equally as groundless which even a single paragraph from  the work will prove and which I shall here quote  Formerly when divisions arose respecting Go∣vernments recourse was had to the sword and a civil war ensued That savage custom is ex∣ploded by the new system and  recourse is had to a National Convention  Discussion and the generol will arbitrates the question and to this private opinion yields with a good grace and  order is preserved uninterrupted  Rights of Man Part II p  That two different charges should be brought at the same time the one by a Member of the Le∣gislative for  not  doing a certain thing and the other by the Attorney General for  doing  it is a strange jumble of contradictions I have now jus∣tified myself or the work rather against the first by stating the case in this letter and the justifica∣tion of the other will be undertaken in its proper place But in any case the work will go on  I shall now conclude this Letter with saying that the only objection I found against the plan and principles contained in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  when I had written the book was that they would beneficially interest at least nine∣tynine persons out of every hundred throughout the nation and therefore would not leave sufficient room for men to act from the direct and disinter∣ested principle of honour but the prosecution now commenced has fortunately removed that objec∣tion and the approvers and protectors of that  work now feel the immediate impulse of honour added to that National Interest  I am Mr Dundas Not your obedient humble Servant But the contrary THOMAS PAINE  TO ONSLOW CRANLEY OR THE  CHAIRMAN  WHO SMALL PRESIDE AT THE MEETING TO BE HELDAY EPSOM JUNE  London  June  th  SIR  I HAVE seen in the Public Newspapers the following Advertisement to wit  To the Nobility Gentlemen Clergy Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the County of Surry  At the requisition and desire of several of the Freeholders of the County I am in the  absence of the Sheriff to desire the favour of your attendance at a Meeting to be held at Epsom on Monday the th Instant at o'Clock at noon to consider of an Humble Address to his MAJESTY to express our grateful approbation of his MAJESTY pater∣nal and welltimed attention to the public wel∣fare in his late most gracious Proclamation a∣gainst the enemies of our happy Constitution  Signed ONSLOW CRANLEY  Taking it for granted that the aforesaid Ad∣vertisement equally as obscure as the Proclama∣tion to which it refers has nevertheless some meaning and is intended to effect some purpose and as prosecution whether wisely or unwisely justly or unjustly is already commenced against a work intitled RIGHTS OF MAN of which I have the honour and happiness to be the author I feel it necessary to address this Letter to you and to request that it may be read publicly to the Gentlemen who shall meet at Epsom in conse∣quence of the Advertisement  The work now under prosecution is I conceive the same work which is intended to be suppressed by the aforesaid ProclamationAdmitting this to be the case the Gentlemen of the county of Surrey are called upon by somebody to condemn a work and they are at the same time forbidden by the Proclamation to know what that work is and they are further called upon to give their aid  and assistance to prevent other people from know∣ing it alsoIt is therefore necessary that the Au∣thor for his own justification as well as to pre∣vent the Gentlemen who shall meet from being imposed upon by misrepresentation should give some outlines of the principles and plans which that work contains  The work Sir in question contains first an investigation of general principles of Govern∣ment  It also distinguishes Government into two clas∣ses or systems the one the hereditary system the other the representative system and it com∣pares these two systems with each other  It shews that what is called Hereditary Go∣vernment cannot exist as a matter of right be∣cause Hereditary Government always means a Government yet to come and the case always is that those who are to live afterwards have al∣ways the same right to establish a Government for themselves as the people who had lived be∣fore them  It also shews the defect to which Hereditary Government is unavoidably subject that it must from the nature of it throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from the want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity JAMES the IId and many others are recorded in the Englist History as proofs of the former of those cases and instances are to be found almost over Europe to prove the truth of the latter  It then shews that the representative system is the only true system of Government that it is also the only system under which the liberties of any people can be permanently secure and fur∣ther that it is the only one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of admitting of none but men properly qualified both by princi∣ples and abilities into Government and of exclud∣ing such as are otherwise  The work shews also by plans and calcula∣tion not hitherto denied nor controverted not even by the prosecution that is commenced that the taxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions that taxes may be entirely taken off from the Poor who are computed at one third of the nation and that taxes on the other two thirds may be considerably reduced that the aged Poor may be comfortably provided for and the children of poor families properly educatedthat fifteen thousand soldiers and the same number of sailors may be disbanded and allowed three shillings per week during life out of the surplus taxes and also that a proportionallowance may be made to the officers and the pay of the remaining soldiers and sailors be en∣creased and that it is better to apply the sur∣plus taxes to those purposes than to consume them upon lazy and profligate placemen and pensioners and that the revenue said to be twenty thousand pounds per annum raised by a tax upon coals and given to the Duke of RICHMOND is a gross imposition upon all the  people of London ought to be instantly abo∣lished  This Sir is a concise abstract of the prin∣ciples and plans contained in the work that is now prosecuted and for the suppression of which the Proclamation appears to be intended but as it is impossible that I can in the compass of a letter bring into view all the matters contained in the work and as it is proper that the Gen∣tlemen who may compose that Meeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are be∣fore they come to any resolutions either direct∣ly or indirectly relating thereto I request the honour of presenting them with one hundred copies of the Second Part of the RIGHTS OF MAN and also one thousand copies of my letter to Mr DUNDAS which I have directed to be sent to Epsom for that purpose and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of presenting them to the Gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion with my sincere wishes for their happiness and for that of the Nation in general  Having now closed thus much of the subject of my letter I next come to speak of what has relation to me personally I am well aware of the delicacy that attends it but the purpose of calling the Meeting appears to me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man and man that it is proper I should as well on account of the Gentlemen who may meet as  on my own account explain myself fully and candidly thereon  I have already informed the Gentlemen that a prosecution is commenced against a work of which I have the honour and happiness to be the Author and I have good reasons for believ∣ing that the Proclamation which the Gentlemen are called to consider and to present an Address upon is purposely calculated to give an impres∣sion to the Jury before whom that matter is to come In short that it is dictating a verdict by Proclamation and I consider the instigators of the Meeting to be held at Epsom as aiding and abetting the same improper and in my opi∣nion illegal purpose and that in a manner very artfully contrived as I shall now shew  Had a Meeting been called of the Freeholders of the County of Middlesex the Gentlemen who had composed that Meeting would have rendered themselves objectionable as persons to serve on a Jury before whom the judicial case was afterwards to come But by calling a meet∣ing out of the County of Middlesex that mat∣ter is artfully avoided and the Gentlemen of Surrey are summoned as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the sort of verdict which the instigators of the Meeting no doubt wish should be brought in and to give counte∣nance to the Jury in so doing  I am SIR With much respect to the Gentlemen who shall meet Their and your obedient humble Servant THOMAS PAINE  TO ONSLOW CRANLEY COMMONLY CALLED LORD ONSLOW  London  June    SIR  WHEN I wrote you the Letter which Mr HORNE TOOKE did me the favour to pre∣sent to you as Chairman of the Meeting held at Epsom Monday June th it was not with much expectation that you would do me the jus∣tice of permitting or recommending it to be pub∣lickly read I am well aware that the signature of THOMAS PAINE has something in it dreadful to sinecure Placemen and Pensioners and when you on seeing the Letter opened informed the Meeting that it was signed THOMAS PAINE and added in a note of exclamation "the common enemy of us all" you spoke one of the greatest truths you ever uttered if you confine the ex∣pression to men of the same description with your∣self men living in indolence and luxury on the spoil and labours of the public  The letter has since appeared in the ARGUS and probably in other papers It will justify it∣self but if any thing on that account hath been wanting your own conduct at the Meeting  would have supplied the omission You there sufficiently proved that I was not mistaken in sup∣posing that the Meeting was called to give an in∣direct aid to the prosecution commenced against a work the reputation of which will long outlive the memory of the Pensioner I am writing to  When Meetings Sir are called by the parti∣zans of the Court to preclude the Nation the right of investigating Systems and Principles of Government and of exposing errors and defects under the pretence of prosecuting any individual it furnishes an additional motive for maintain∣ing facred that violated right  The principles and arguments contained in the work in question RIGHTS OF MAN have stood and they now stand and I believe ever will stand unrefuted They are stated in a fair and open manner to the world and they have al∣ready received the public approbation of a greater number of men of the best of characters of every denomination of religion and of every rank in life Placemen and Pensioners excepted than all the Juries that shall meet in England for ten years to come will amount to and I have moregood reasons for believing that the approvers of that work as well private as public are already more numerous than all the present Electors throughout the Nation  Not less than forty pamphlets intended as an∣swers thereto have appeared and as suddenly dis∣appeared Scarcely are the titles of any of them remembered notwithstanding their endeavours  have been aided by all the daily abuse which the Court and Ministterial Newspapers for almost a year and a half could bestow both upon the work and the author and now that every at∣tempt to refute and every abuse has failed the invention of calling the work a Libel has been hit upon and the discomfited party has pusilla∣nimously retreated to prosecution and a Jury and obscure Addresses  As I well knew that a long Letter from me will not be agreeable to you I will relieve your un∣easiness by making it as short as I conveniently can and will conclude it with taking up the sub∣ject at that part where Mr HORNE TOOKE was interrupted from going on when at the Meeting  That Gentleman was staring that the situ∣ation you stood in render it improper for you to appear  actively  in a scene in which your private interest was too visible that you were a Bed∣chamber Lord at a thousand a year and a Pen∣sioner at three thousand pounds a year more and here he was stopped by the little but noisy circle you had collected round Permit me then Sir to add an explanation to his words for the benefit of your neighbours and with which and a few observations I shall close my letter  When it was reported in the English News∣papers some short time since that the Empress of RUSSIA had given to one of her minions a large tract of country and several thousands of  peasants as property it very justly provoked in∣dignation and abhorrence in those who heard it But if we compare the mode practiced in Eng∣land with that which appears to us so abhorrent in Russia it will be found to amount to very near the same thingfor example  As the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxes from the pockets of the people those things called gifts and grants of which kind are all pensions and sinecure places are paid out of that stock The difference there∣fore between the two modes is that in England the money is collected by the Government and then given to the Pensioner and in Russia he is left to collect it for himself The smallest sum which the poorest family in a county so near London as Surrey can be supposed to pay annu∣ally of taxes is not less than five pounds and as your sinecure of one thousand and pension of three thousand per annum are made up of taxes paid by eight hundred such poor families it comes to the same thing as if the eight hundered families had been given to you as in Russia and you had collected the money on your ac∣count Were you to say that you are not quar∣tered particularly on the people of Surrey but on the nation at large the objection would a∣mount to nothing for as there are more Pensi∣oners than counties every one may be consider∣ed as quartered on that in which he lives  What honour or happiness you can derive  from being the PRINCIPAL PAUPER of the neighbourhood and occasioning a greater ex∣pence than the poor the aged and the infirm for ten miles round you I leave you to enjoy At the same time I can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous in suppressing a book which strikes at the root of those abuses No wonder that you should be against Reforms a∣gainst the Freedom of the Press and the Right of Investigation To you and to others of your description these are dreadful things but you should also consider that the motives which prompt you to  act  ought by reflection to com∣pel you to be  silent  Having now returned your compliment and sufficiently tired your patience I take my leave of you with mentioning that if you had not prevented my former Letter from being read at the Meeting you would not have had the trou∣ble of reading this and also with requesting that the next time you call me  a common ene∣my  you would add "  of us sinecure Placemen and Pensioners  I am Sir c c c THOMAS PAINE
