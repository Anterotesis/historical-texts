 ZOBEIDE A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in COVENTGARDEN  deserta per ardua dulcis  Raptat Amor  VIRG  THE THIRD EDITION  LONDON Printed for T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY SCARSDALE  MADAM  I KNOW not whether mankind can be said to have less Vanitybut of this I am certain that they have infinitely more Delicacyformerly Dedicators met with few difficulties in addressing their PatronsThey made them every thing that was wise and good and their Patrons in return though they might not approve the production yet gave their authors an entire credit for a clear insight into human nature  But contraband traffick brings many a good trade into disrepute and a fair dealer has now often only a limited opportunity of vending his just merchandise How hard then is the condition of us modern Dedicators To lavish encomiums where they are not due is not the fashion of the times and now when the Subject demands and there is the fairest opportunity of expatiating on the most exemplary Character I have your LADYSHIP's express prohibitionBut public disorders frequently bring the seeds of remedy along with themIf I had spoken as I ought it had been called an UNIVERSAL opinion and your LADYSHIP perceives by this address that I affect singularity but should I in the least have failed the world would have loudly exclaimed that  I had said TOO LITTLE and your LADYSHIP still more unjustly have censured me for having said TOO MUCH  I have the honour to be with the greatest regard  Your LADYSHIP's Sincere friend and Obliged servant J CRADOCK  PROLOGUE  Written by Dr GOLDSMITH Spoken by Mr QUICK  IN these bold times when Learning's sons explore  The distant climate and the savage shore  When wise  Astronomers  to  India  steer  And quit for  Venus  many a brighter here  While  Botanists  all cold to smiles and dimpling  Forsake the fair and patientlygo simpling  When every bosom swells with wond'rous scenes  Priests cannibals and hoitytoity queens  Our bard into the general spirit enters  And fits his little frigate for adventures  With  Scythian stores  and trinkets deeply laden  He this way steers his course in hopes of trading  Yet ere he lands he'as ordered me before  To make an observation on the shore  Where are we driven Our reck'ning sure is lost  This seems a barren and a dangerous coast  Lord what a sultry climate am I under  Yon illforeboding cloud seems big with thunder  Upper Gallery  There Mangroves spread and larger than I've seen 'em  Pit  Here trees of stately sizeand turtles in 'em  Balconies  Here illcondition'd oranges abound  Stage  And apples  takes up one and tastes it  bitter  apples strew the ground  The place is uninhabited I fear  I heard a hissingthere are serpents here  O there the natives area dreadful race  The men have tails the women paint the face  No doubt they're all barbariansYes 'tis so  I'll try to make palaver with them though  making signs  'Tis best however keeping at a distance  Good Savages our Captain craves assistance  Our ship's well stor'din yonder creek we've laid her  His honour is no mercenary trader  This is his first adventure lend him aid  Or you may chance to spoil a thriving trade  His goods he hopes are prime and brought from far  Equally fit for gallantry and war  What no reply to promises so ample  I'd best step backand order up a sample  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  HERMODON Chief of a Canton in Scythia  Mr CLARKE  INDATER Son to Hermodon  Mr SAVIGNY  ATHAMAND Prince of Persia  Mr SMITH  SEYFEL an ancient general banished from Persia  Mr HULL  HASAN friend to Athamand  Mr OWENSON  WOMEN  ZOBEIDE  Mrs YATES  SULMA  Mrs VINCENT  SCYTHIANS PERSIANS  ZOBEIDE A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  The SCENE represents rocks and trees with a distant view of the river Oxus  HERMODON INDATER Scythians  HERMODON  _WHENCE this daring insult  What strangers these who with intrusive march  Have pass'd the summits of high Imaus' rocks  Mean they to ravage on the banks of Oxus  Or spoil the plains of innocence and peace  INDATER  Our troops whose minds no dangers can appal  Observing from afar some hasty steps  Advance with eager speedThe Persians meet us  When straight a martial youth with haughty mien  Demanded of us parley with our master  HERMODON  What master know we here where all are free  No kings no subjects but all friends and brothers  INDATER  He said that visiting the Persian frontier  He wish'd to see a people far renown'd  For ancient manners and bleak liberty  We offer them safe conduct and protection  Whilst they present to our astonish'd sight  Rich trappings blazing shields gold diamonds pearls  The guilty spoils of desolating war  But we reject these specious toys of grandeur  For poverty is chiefest grandeur here  Not wealth corrupter of simplicity  In short we swear an amity sincere  And lo they come to crown this prosp'rous day  Which gives me happiness and Zobeide  HERMODON  But Zobeide thou know'st whose blooming charms  Have won thy soulwas born among the Persians  INDATER  The sun which rises o'er yon eastern hill  And which each morn we gratefully adore  Shines not on us aloneIt shines on Persia  Then may not Persia boast its ray divine  HERMODON  Thou little know'st the secrets of my heart  Since after four long years in friendship past  I still am stranger to her father's story  What fate mysterious lur'd him to these climes  Why persecution still attends his exile  For ever as I'd sooth him into converse  He answers but with tributary tears  INDATER  To this fair country's maxims and her laws  He cheerfully submitsand wayworn age  Can rarely change the bent of early nature  But fairest Zobeide  HERMODON  Is worthy of thee  And yet I cannot guess the cause her father  Blushes to speak of whom he is descended  His rank his fortunes and his fame unknown  INDATER  Whoe'er he be I'm sure he's just and valiant  He loves meHe is father to my Zobeide  HERMODON  As no vile aims debase a Scythian's mind  We will not meanly stoop to ask a prize  The brightest fairest prize whilst covert fears  Or foul distrust sit low'ring on our motives  Seek him my sonif no unworthy thoughts  Shall harbour in his breastI will consent  But see he comes  Enter SEYFEL  INDATER  O generous old man  Thou dear companion of our happy shepherds  This day some gallant youths will soon arrive  And view with joy the festive rites that wait us  I from thy hand this happy day receive  A gift more precious than the throne of Cyrus  What age of service can repay such goodness  I cannot speak the feelings of my heart  Witness ye Godsnot Hermodon more shares  My duty or my loveAh whence those tears  SEYFEL  They flow from tenderness and former cares  If amidst all my griefs this faithful union  Should heal some wound which rankles near my heart  The scar would still remainFor blessings oft  Recal to mind the evils we have suffer'd  INDATER  O speak the fatal source of each misfortune  If not redress we may at least infuse  The sacred balm of sympathizing pity  HERMODON  For all the friendship we have firmly sworn  Thou ow'st this tribute to us  SEYFEL  My gentle youth  Zobeide thou know'st submits her will to mine  She is the only good the Gods have left me  I wish this marriageI'll advise persuade  But cannot strain the bond of rightful sway  The soft authority of friend and parent  Go thou dear hope of my declining age  I would some private conf'rence hereMeanwhile  Artless as native truth still urge thy suit  Obtain her promise and depend on mine  Exit Indater  Ere I begin the story of my life  Let me gaze round with grateful rapture here  Believe me Hermodonthese rocks these trees  To me seem nobler than the Persian court  HERMODON  Thou once wast great  SEYFEL  I was  HERMODON  Too long my friend  Thy griefs pent up have prey'd upon thy heart  I do not hate the greatI love the Persians  Their laws and noble manners I admire  Tho' all mankind at first were equal born  I strictly hold that subjects should obey  Those whom their Gods make delegates of pow'r  Simplicity's soft charms in this republic  Are no fit lessons for monarchic states  Could'st thou suppose that I was less attach'd  Because in Scythia  SEYFEL  If I have long conceal'd  The source of my misfortunespardon me  Pardon a parent's doubtsI'd lost my all  My child here wander'd friendlessunprotected  I fear'd the foul disgraces of her father  Would fall on her and stain her rising glory  HERMODON  Forbear thy tears  SEYFEL  Know then that under Cyrus  I carried terror to th' affrighted nations  Hircania bow'd her neck unto my yoke  Hircania free till then  HERMODON  Most harsh the chains  Which gall the stubborn neck of liberty  SEYFEL  Oppression's arts unworthy of the brave  To be the Prince's slave t' enslave his people  To crouch or cruelly exact obedience  Dazzled a whilebut now demand repentance  The noble Cyrus with a lavish hand  Would heap on me full measure of rewards  I ever was the partner of his counsels  But Cyrus diedand I was soon forgotten  Cambyses I abandon'dimpious man  Unworthy successor of such a father  Ecbatan as yet the abode of Media's Prince  At her new court conceal'd my hoary head  Till Smerdis governing the Median realm  Smerdis who sought the ruin of the virtuous  Gave a decisive blow to all my hopes  The unbridled Athamand his sister's son  In firm alliance with a noble princess  Whom Persia's court had destin'd to his love  His tyrant passions brooking no controul  Demanded Zobeide as despotic master  HERMODON  And did his life repay the glaring outrage  SEYFEL  Thrice arm'd with innocence th' undaunted fair  Compell'd our flight into this distant land  By me alone she was deliver'd from him  The monsters who surround the impious Smerdis  More than their common arts employ'd against us  With fairest colours hid the worst designs  And couch'd the dagger lab'ring to destroy us  In Media it is treason as at Babylon  To brand the prince who next must fill the throne  HERMODON  O dire effects of hellborn servitude  Is then complaint a crime in Persia's court  Can you regret the loss of basest grandeur  SEYFEL  There you awake the thought which wrings my heart  Smerdis proscrib'd my lifethey seiz'dthey shar'd  Employmentswealththe price of all my service  My faithful child accompanied my flight  With patient steps we labour'd up the steep  Of Taurus' craggy cliffs whose o'erhung brow  Indignant frowns upon the boist'rous main  Wearied by toilsthanks to the pitying Gods  In these fair climes we found unhop'dfor peace  Would I had here been born All  my  regret  Is to have run a desperate mad career  In courts and camps attendant upon kings  But I perceive my child shut up in desarts  Regrets the pleasures of her former life  And much I fear that reason filial duty  Combat too weakly each delusive vision  Courts and their pomp will fascinate our eyes  Ere bitter ills annoy the sick'ning soul  HERMODON  What ills await you here ah what regret  With us she's free applaudedhonour'd  No lurking dangers taint this hallow'd soil  Here liberty has fixt her blest abode  And looks with pity down upon the great  SEYFEL  Oh I should die content if my dear child  Hated like me the perfidy of courts  But let not my inquietudes repress  The dawning joys that beam upon thy fon  Conceal them from him  Enter INDATER  Zobeide is mine  The blooming maid accepts my earnest suit  Let not my father or his generous friend  Frown on my fate and I am blest indeed  HERMODON  Our wish my son is to behold thee happy  SEYFEL  Auspicious hour I feel my life renew  A second spring shoots through my aged veins  And makes me hope return of better days  Enter SCYTHIANS in haste  SCYTHIAN  As late I watch'd my flocks on yonder hills  A splendid troop pass'd bytheir chief I find  Whose turban glitter'd on his cloudy brow  Is bound to search an aged warrior out  Who formerly was known in Media's camps  Demands of us the place where he's conceal'd  Th' unfortunate old man he long has sought for  HERMODON  O heav'ns let him pursue him to these arms  INDATER  He there is shelter'd whilst I live to guard him  SCYTHIAN  The gen'rous Persian comes not to defy  A race of shepherds innocent as brave  His breast seems lab'ring with some weighty grief  Perhaps a banish'd man some hardy warrior  Who flies a court unmindful of his service  Perhaps  Second SCYTHIAN  'Tis said that half worn out with cares  He only seeks a safe retreat from danger  Weeps the past horrors of malignant fate  And grateful hails the dawn of rising freedom  HERMODON  His tears are more suspicious than his presents  Pardon my anxious doubtsI fear the Persians  These brilliant slaves are willing to betray us  Thee my best friend perhaps they seek for here  Perhaps the tyrant at thy flight enrag'd  Demands thy rated lifeA spotless chief  Must sometimes bleed to save the guilty prince  SEYFEL  Forgetting princes in these happier climes  I am forgotten tooI fear them not  INDATER  We'll perish all ere this indignant stranger  Shall offer insult to my more than father  HERMODON  Whoe'er he be I shall not shun his walks  If bold chastise if exil'd we'll protect him  INDATER  Let him come onhe shall not cloud our joys  A Scythian's heart is steel'd 'gainst panic terrors  Prepare the altar for th' approaching nuptials  Place round it ev'ry gift of bounteous Nature  And there present the hand that combats for thee  To Seyfel  No cares intrude and may th' immortal Gods  Bending from high to hear our plighted vows  Propitious smile on this important hour  That gilds or darkens all my future days  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  ZOBEIDE SULMA  SULMA  BUT what are your resolves  ZOBEIDE  Here to remain  And pass my days in this wild savage desart  They shall not see me wearied with an effort  To wait the death of a determin'd father  Not irritate a power which condemns him  When to these climes our flight was first propos'd  A thousand horrid fears besieg'd my fancy  But time has reconcil'd these drear abodes  'Tis no more Zobeide at a court ador'd  No more the Persians jealous of my smiles  Pursue the footsteps of declining beauty  I've sworn a total change of life and manners  My only pride to emulate a father  SULMA  Your virtue far surpasses your misfortunes  In your abasement I behold your grandeur  I must admire you allis your heart fixt  To shun the climes where nature gave you birth  When dangers threaten or when ills impend  We shun the country which disturbs our quiet  But soon the clouds dispers'd we feel regret  We feel for pleasures which we never knew  And nature triumphs o'er our vanquish'd fears  ZOBEIDE  From the loud raging of a vengeful storm  Heav'n grants this gloomy shelterhere my friend  Now allresign'd awhile I will endure  Nor shall you longer share my adverse fortunes  Among those friends who have abandon'd me  You'll find some mind compassionate enough  To recompense the gratitude I owe you  Go my dear Sulma leave me to my fate  Review proud Ecbatan's most happy people  And in these desarts leave your faithful Zobeide  SULMA  Rather let sudden death pursue such perfidy  If ever I conceive the base design  Remote from you to court ignoble grandeur  I forfeit all for youyour destiny  E'en to the tomb is closely link'd with mine  But yet I own with horror and surprize  I see those charms which monarchs should adore  Ignobly lavish'd on a Scythian peasant  ZOBEIDE  When I reflect on the indignant outrage  Done to my youth my family and name  A fatal offspring of th' immortal Cyrus  Banish'd for ever from the Persian court  For ever bound to curse the faithless Athamand  When these fell woes are summon'd to my view  All human things are equal to my eyes  All are indifferent  SULMA  Useless constraint  Do those deep sighs betray a tranquil mind  ZOBEIDE  Cease to disturb the vows I've sworn to heav'n  I never will review my native land  If my frail heart would swerve from duty's path  It must be bound in chains which can't be broken  SULMA  Th' unhappy father's voluntary victim  With what reproaches can you load your mind  ZOBEIDE  With noneGods I renew my vowsnever  Ye never shall behold the guilt of Zobeide  SULMA  Your choice is made then  ZOBEIDE  All is fixtMy father  Prefers the son of his most faithful friend  SULMA  Can Zobeide  ZOBEIDE  Behold the sacred altar  The back scene opens and discloses the altar  My happier friends without regret prepare  Those fatal chains which bind these hands for ever  Enter INDATER  Where is the lovely bridethe rites await  Impatience chides the tardiness of age  Whose frozen foot imprints the rocky soil  O let me hear thee speakread in those eyes  That I'm the happy object of thy choice  Marriage with us is as a link of nature  Form'd between souls most liberal and pure  A warlike youth entreats a warrior's daughter  Will she partake his travels and his fortunes  Attend his combats or avenge his death  Shall Scythia rival Persia in her pride  And I receive the world's best gift in Zobeide  ZOBEIDE  I know thy virtues and esteem thy valour  Thy open candour and thy generous heart  I promise thee I've promis'd too my father  His choice and mine are sureties for the treaty  INDATER  You speak a language foreign to my soul  And whilst you make me blest destroy the blessing  'Tis said within the walls of Ecbatan  Those eyes have spread a lustre through the court  But tell me Zobeideis it my misfortune  Did heav'n ordain thee to adorn a throne  ZOBEIDE  It is not thy misfortuneit is mine  My memory retraces not my glory  I have forgotten all  INDATER  Still more ador'd  Forget it if thou can'stit lives with me  Can'st thou contented view this rustic shrine  The sacred monument of ancient worship  Here do our fathers pay their grateful off'rings  Not such as useless smoke in prouder climes  But nature's gifts fair emblems of their hearts  ZOBEIDE  That mind must surely err whose narrow scope  Confines religion to a place or clime  A Power unknown that actuates the world  Whose eye is just whose ev'ry thought is wisdom  Regards alone the tribute of the heart  Pride in his awful sight shrinks back appall'd  Humility is eldest born of virtue  And claims her birthright at the throne of heav'n  INDATER  Some Persians newly landed on our shores  Wish to partake our sportsThey'll wond'ring view  A people all united but by virtue  ZOBEIDE  Persians What sayst thou Persians  INDATER  Thou tremblest  Can Zobeide fear to view a race of slaves  ZOBEIDE  Oh my dear Sulma  SULMA  See your father comes  INDATER  Our parents friends thy faithful choice companions  All come to consecrate the solemn feast  ZOBEIDE  Away then I obey  To Sulma  Enter SEYFEL HERMODON SCYTHIANS  HERMODON  Behold the Altar  The sacred flame of nature and of love  Our solemn rites as simple as ourselves  SEYFEL  Thy father's

thou me not  SEYFEL  Too wellWhat mad persuasion  Conducts thy erring steps to these retreats  Thy monarch set a price upon my head  Would'st thou demand itDomisguided man  But tremble for thy ownI stand amaz'd  To see thee brave a race that fear not kings  ATHAMAND  O people fam'd for justice hear me speak  'Tis Cyrus' nephew makes you judge between us  HERMODON  Nephew to Cyrus and among the Scythians  ATHAMAND  Stern justice leads me onIn vain you threaten  Unfortunate old manIn me behold  Thy future staythe comfort of thy age  'Tis true a monarch robb'd thee of thy fame  A sentence most unjust prevail'd against thee  Scythians that monarch is no moreI flew  With wings of speed to bring th' important news  Thou shalt partake my treasures and my pow'r  What prince before did ever quit a throne  To trace the footsteps of an injur'd friend  Hear me then Seyfelhear thy country's voice  Yield to a monarch's suit a monarch's vows  Yield to these tears which speak my deep remorse  SEYFEL  Thou can'st not hence seduce me  generous  Athamand  If deep remorse had struck thy thorny breast  Or meek repentance worn thy soul with care  Spite of the ills I'd felt I ought to pardon  But O I trace the source of this distraction  It cannot be for me those tears are shed  Leave me then Athamandmy doom is fixt  Here will I languish out a weary life  And die with holy freedomLead on my friends  The ties shall be redoubled that unite us  Ex Hermodon Seyfel and Scythians  ATHAMAND  I stand immoveableO heaven O destiny  O fatal passion bent on my destruction  Gone Is he fledwould he not stay to hear  The fiercest Daemon of infernal vengeance  Might glut his rage to see a monarch humbled  But say my Hasan why yon altar burns  Those lights those garlandsWhy the nuptial torch  A woman too was dragg'd in haste away  At our approachYe pow'rs What have I seen  Remorse will change to an avenging fury  Gods steel my injur'd heart  HASAN  Think where you are  Your grandeur serves but to inflame their fierceness  They know how to defendvengeance they adore  They pardon not if once they are offended  ATHAMAND  I scorn them allI've seen them in our camps  Their stoutest warriors and their ablest men  A lifeless race compar'd with Persian troops  HASAN  But sovereigns 'mong themselves  ATHAMAND  Why wilt thou thwart  My stern resolvesthe transports that inflame me  My passions bear me on and reason not  Had I us'd reason I had ne'er been here  Zobeide might drag me to earth's utmost verge  Her loaded slave now brings again his chains  To chain himself to fortune that pursues him  To snatch her from a most indignant slav'ry  Which this old man imposes on her youth  To die then at her feet with love or madness  If this torn heart can never soften her's  HASAN  Hear but a moment  ATHAMAND  I will not hear  HASAN  Stay  ATHAMAND  Why stay  This vile this ignominious rival  Insults my woes and outrages my honour  To make him master of all earthly blessings  I cannot take alarm too soon my friend  A peasant here is pois'd against a monarch  Can any parent force a choice so vile  She is possess'd of nobleness of soul  Nor can demean herself to wed a slave  HASAN  Pride is inconstantshe  ATHAMAND  Raise no foul doubts  If pity cannot move her wretched father  My tears despis'd he trembles at my anger  A prince is but a man and man may err  But when forgetting his ennobled rank  He makes due reparation for his faults  From heaven he pardon hopes from man demands it  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III SCENE I  ATHAMAND HASAN  ATHAMAND  I Knew it wasI could foresee it all  Gods could it be Zobeide  HASAN  At your approach  Fear and amazement shook that beauteous form  And life itself stood trembling on her cheek  But in those moments with a fault'ring voice  She tenderly pronounc'd the name of Media  A Scythian told me thisa hardy youth  Who once beneath our honour'd banners fought  The father and the husband now are with her  ATHAMAND  The husband Who  HASAN  The valiant Indater  The hope and glory of this fam'd republic  To Zobeide here he swore eternal ardor  Beneath the cypress shadeat this rude altar  As you advanc'd she sunk o'erwhelm'd with terrors  But then a fair attendant crowd press'd on  And bore her weeping to yon rustic roofs  ATHAMAND  No more my friend I can endure no more  My griefs pour in so fast I cannot pause  To separate the tortures that surround me  Why should she tremble when she touch'd the altar  Ah why indeedShe knew my glaring crimes  She knew an altar could not yield protection  She saw her father most unjustly banish'd  Herself too driv'n to these inhuman desarts  The sum of all her woes was present to her  And I the fatal hated cause of all  HASAN  Her father  ATHAMAND  Had the proud exile read my heart  He then must have appeas'd the woes I suffer'd  He then had pardon'd and thou might'st have sooth'd me  But now I raveO pity my distraction  The fireey'd transports of tyrannic love  Hell is in ev'ry thoughtBut say my Hasan  Did she not faintly name her native country  HASAN  No doubt she still must love  ATHAMAND  She loves it not  She love her native landShe weds a Scythian  I see him in her armsO hold my brain  She twines him now with unrepining rapture  Seize him this instant Hasan  Go cloud the honours of the fell barbarian  Tell him his lise shall dearly pay the price  Crimes damn'd like these shall feel a monarch's vengeance  HASAN  O think my prince you're not at Ecbatan  Your voice decides not herehere you may perish  Are you not now within those curst domains  Where many of your ancestors have bled  ATHAMAND  Here too I'll bleed  Flourish  What martial sounds are those  Whence are these rustic troops who high in air  Brandish their threat'ning spears  HASAN  Such are their sports  'Tis thus they celebrate the festive day  By nature fond of valorous exploit  But O retire at distance I descry  The ling'ring brideas yet we're unobserv'd  Let prudence guide you nowthe time's at hand  Remote from all you may again behold her  And speak the troubles of your lab'ring breast  Exeunt  CHORUS  Returning from the altar  Now the Rites are all

will my fate do with me Ah my Sulma  This storm will overwhelm me'tis too much  Cease thou false persecuting prince  What would'st thou add to all the woes I've suffer'd  ATHAMAND  Hear but a moment  ZOBEIDE  Ought I barbarous man  Consider where I am and what would Athamand  ATHAMAND  By love conducted from the Persian throne  I come to cast an empire at thy feet  By Smerdis' death I'm lord of half the world  I'm lord of all if Zobeide smiles upon me  ZOBEIDE  What hast thou said too cruel Why from afar  Com'st thou to plant new troubles in my breast  When first I listen'd to the soothing tale  No king enforcing Hymen's awful rites  Had doom'd thy hand to one more worthy of thee  But now  Without a crime thou canst not share my heart  Without a crime I cannot listen to thee  Those hallow'd rites have bound my humbler choice  Take pity and respect the gentle Indater  ATHAMAND  A Scythianso lowso vile  ZOBEIDE  Despise him not  He far surpasses Athamand in virtue  ATHAMAND  Who could surpass me had I power to charm thee  Thy love alone would stamp immortal fame  Thy love is fate to meit caus'd my crimes  And love must free me to a gazing world  ZOBEIDE  If thou hadst sooner felt this generous flame  Now 'tis too late  ATHAMAND  This is the pressing hour  Fly hence partake the glories of my reign  O fly with me to dignify dominion  ZOBEIDE  May'st thou remote far far from these sad eyes  Behold thy reign most favour'd by the Gods  ATHAMAND  I will not reign without theeRobb'd of thee  Empire itself's a curse  ZOBEIDE  O thinkyour glory  ATHAMAND  My glory 'tis to love you  ZOBEIDE  Illfated hour  When first you swore fidelity and truth  ATHAMAND  In these vile haunts can Zobeide waste her days  ZOBEIDE  My days were all beset with hideous terrors  'Till Indater became my kind protector  If then I live a prey to sullen grief  Or wan despair'twas Athamand's decree  For he alone condemn'd me to the desart  ATHAMAND  I sue to snatch thee hence thy hand as yet  Has not confirm'd this most dishonour'd union  ZOBEIDE  I've made my vows to heav'n  ATHAMAND  Heav'n heard them not  Kind heav'n was deaf in pity to my love  ZOBEIDE  Think on the ills your faithless love has caus'd  Think I was driven from a parent soil  Where ev'ry joy press'd onward to my wishes  Think what I suffer'd when o'er trackless wastes  I wander'd all expos'dWhen north winds rag'd  And hideous monsters howl'd their fell complainings  Where can the wretched find a peaceful shelter  Ah where indeed When he her only hope  Forsook despis'd abandon'd and betray'd her  ATHAMAND  No more my love at this important hour  But melt thy father's heart with soft persuasion  Say to him  ZOBEIDE  Never O neverchoice is made  I and my friends are destin'd to misfortune  Urg'd on by Fate my honour shall not shrink  Think'st thou that Seyfel ever would consent  His longtry'd virtue shudders not at dangers  ATHAMAND  He is the fatal cause of all our woes  ZOBEIDE  Thou art alone to blameagain to see me  Again to plead and drive me to distraction  Leave me my PrinceBe just to wretched Seyfel  O leave us here to linger out our days  My father comesBegonethis moment leave me  ATHAMAND  No let us bend him from his stubborn purpose  ZOBEIDE  I' th' name of love by all our past misfortunes  By all that poisons my remaining days  Fly nor afflict him with thy cruel presence  ATHAMAND  Love plays the tyrant and commands respect  Gods who behold the tortures I endure  Second my love or guide me to my vengeance  Exit  Enter SEYFEL  SEYFEL  This hated foe again to glut his rage  Must I resign my life  ZOBEIDE  He seeks it not  Dear father he regards us bothBut I  Spite of his vows would never see him more  SEYFEL  A worthy Scythian now is thinethy choice  For I controul'd thee not receiv'd his homage  ZOBEIDE  I knew your will and never would offend you  The son of Hermodon was dearest to you  SEYFEL  'Tis true he wasa gentle noble youth  Most generous and humaneAnd yet reflect  There is a harshness in the Scythian manners  No faults when known escape their punishment  ZOBEIDE  Why should you seek to terrify my mind  If I have patient borne for four sad years  A weight of woes why am I now suspected  I've made a sacrifice of love to duty  If I in aught have fail'd I will atone  But will not fear a father or a husband  SEYFEL  Think not thy father labour'd to reproach thee  Thy husband was thy choicehe sure is dear  O may thy peace be henceforth undisturb'd  Give up this day to merriment and joy  Forget thy illsI hasten to the festival  Exit
