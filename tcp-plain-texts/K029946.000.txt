 THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE AN ALLEGORICAL POEM  Written in IMITATION of SPENSER  By  JAMES THOMSON  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR over against  Catherinestreet  in the  Strand  M DCC XLVIII  THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE  The Castle hight of Indolence  And its false Luxury  Where for a little Time alas  We liv'd right jollily  I  O MORTAL Man who livest here by Toil  Do not complain of this thy hard Estate  That like an Emmet thou must ever moil  Is a sad Sentence of an ancient Date  And certes there is for it Reason great  For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail  And curse thy Star and early drudge and late  Withouten That would come an heavier Bale  oose Life unruly Passions and Diseases pale  II  In lowly Dale fast by a River's Side  With woody Hill o'er Hill encompass'd round  A most enchanting Wizard did abide  Than whom a Fiend more fell is no where found  It was I ween a lovely Spot of Ground  And there a Season atween June and May  Half prankt with Spring with Summer half imbrown'd  A listless Climate made where Sooth to say  No living Wight could work ne cared even for Play  III  Was nought around but Images of Rest  Sleepsoothing Groves and quiet Lawns between  And flowery Beds that slumbrous Influence kest  From Poppies breath'd and Beds of pleasant Green  Where never yet was creeping Creature seen  Mean time unnumber'd glittering Streamlets play'd  And hurled everywhere their Waters sheen  That as they bicker'd through the sunny Glade  Though restless still themselves a lulling Murmur made  IV  Join'd to the Prattle of the purling Rills  Were heard the lowing Herds along the Vale  And Flocks loudbleating from the distant Hills  And vacant Shepherds piping in the Dale  And now and then sweet Philomel would wail  Or StockDoves plain amid the Forest deep  That drowsy rustled to the sighing Gale  And still a Coil the Grashopper did keep  Yet all these Sounds yblent inclined all to Sleep  V  Full in the Passage of the Vale above  A sable silent solemn Forest stood  Where nought but shadowy Forms were seen to move  As  Idless  fancy'd in her dreaming Mood  And up the Hills on either Side a Wood  Of blackening Pines ay waving to and fro  Sent forth a sleepy Horror through the Blood  And where this Valley winded out below  The murmuring Main was heard and scarcely heard to flow  VI  A pleasing Land of Drowsyhed it was  Of Dreams that wave before the halfshut Eye  And of gay Castles in the Clouds that pass  For ever flushing round a SummerSky  There eke the soft Delights that witchingly  Instil a wanton Sweetness through the Breast  And the calm Pleasures always hover'd nigh  But whate'er smack'd of Noyance or Unrest  Was far far off expell'd from this delicious Nest  VII  The Landskip such inspiring perfect Ease  Where INDOLENCE for so the Wizard hight  Closehid his Castle mid embowering Trees  That half shut out the Beams of Phoebus bright  And made a Kind of checker'd Day and Night  Mean while unceasing at the massy Gate  Beneath a spacious Palm the wicked Wight  Was plac'd and to his Lute of cruel Fate  And Labour harsh complain'd lamenting Man's Estate  VIII  Thither continual Pilgrims crouded still  From all the Roads of Earth that pass there by  For as they chaunc'd to breathe on neighbouring Hill  The Freshness of this Valley smote their Eye  And drew them ever and anon more nigh  'Till clustering round th'Enchanter false they hung  Ymolten with his Syren Melody  While o'er th' enfeebling Lute his Hand he flung  And to the trembling Chords these tempting Verses sung  IX  " Behold ye Pilgrims of this Earth behold  " See all but Man with unearn'd Pleasure gay  " See her bright Robes the Butterfly unfold  " Broke from her wintry Tomb in Prime of May  " What youthful Bride can equal her Array  " Who can with Her for easy Pleasure vie  " From Mead to Mead with gentle Wing to stray  " From Flower to Flower on balmy Gales to fly  " Is all she has to do beneath the radiant Sky  X  " Behold the merry Minstrels of the Morn  " The swarming Songsters of the careless Grove  " Ten thousand Throats that from the flowering Thorn  " Hymn their Good GOD and carol sweet of Love  " Such grateful kindly Raptures them emove  " They neither plough nor sow ne fit for Flail  " E'er to the Barn the nodding Sheaves they drove  " Yet theirs each Harvest dancing in the Gale  " Whatever crowns the Hill or smiles along the Vale  XI  " Outcast of Nature Man the wretched Thrall  " Of bitterdropping Sweat of sweltry Pain  " Of Cares that eat away thy Heart with Gall  " And of the Vices an inhuman Train  " That all proceed from savage Thirst of Gain  " For when hardhearted  Interest  first began  " To poison Earth  Astraea  left the Plain  " Guile Violence and Murder seiz'd on Man  " And for soft milky Streams with Blood the Rivers ran  XII  " Come ye who still the cumbrous Load of Life  " Push hard up Hill but as the farthest Steep  " You trust to gain and put an End to Strife  " Down thunders back the Stone with mighty Sweep  " And hurls your Labours to the Valley deep  " Forever vain come and withouten Fee  " I in Oblivion will your Sorrows steep  " Your Cares your Toils will steep you in a Sea  " Of full Delight O come ye weary Wights to me  XIII  " With me you need not rise at early Dawn  " To pass the joyless Day in various Stounds  " Or louting low on upstart Fortune fawn  " And sell fair Honour for some paltry Pounds  " Or through the City take your dirty Rounds  " To cheat and dun and lye and Visit pay  " Now flattering base now giving secret Wounds  " Or proul in Courts of Law for human Prey  " In venal Senate thieve or rob on broad Highway  XIV  " No Cocks with me to rustic Labour call  " From Village on to Village sounding clear  " To tardy Swain no shrillvoic'd Matrons squall  " No Dogs no Babes no Wives to stun your Ear  " No Hammers thump no horrid Blacksmith sear  " Ne noisy Tradesman your sweet Slumbers start  " With Sounds that are a Misery to hear  " But all is calm as would delight the Heart  " Of  Sybarite  of old all Nature and all Art  XV  " Here nought but Candour reigns indulgent Ease  " Goodnatur'd Lounging Sauntering up and down  " They who are pleas'd themselves must always please  " On Others' Ways they never squint a Frown  " Nor heed what haps in Hamlet or in Town  " Thus from the Source of tender Indolence  " With milky Blood the Heart is overflown  " Is sooth'd and sweeten'd by the social Sense  " For Interest Envy Pride and Strife are banish'd hence  XVI  " What what is Virtue but Repose of Mind  " A pure ethereal Calm that knows no Storm  " Above the Reach of wild Ambition's Wind  " Above those Passions that this World deform  " And torture Man a proud malignant Worm  " But here instead soft Gales of Passion play  " And gently stir the Heart thereby to form  " A quicker Sense of Joy as Breezes stray  " Across th' enliven'd Skies and make them still more gay  XVII  " The Best of Men have ever lov'd Repose  " They hate to mingle in the filthy Fray  " Where the Soul sowrs and gradual Rancour grows  " Imbitter'd more from peevish Day to Day  " Even Those whom Fame has lent her fairest Ray  " The most renown'd of worthy Wights of Yore  " From a base World at last have stolen away  " So SCIPIO to the soft  Cumaean  Shore  " Retiring tasted Joy he never knew before  XVIII  " But if a little Exercise you chuse  " Some Zest for Ease 'tis not forbidden here  " Amid the Groves you may indulge the Muse  " Or tend the Blooms and deck the vernal Year  " Or softly stealing with your watry Gear  " Along the Brooks the crimsonspotted Fry  " You may delude The whilst amus'd you hear  " Now the hoarse Stream and now the Zephir's Sigh  " Attuned to the Birds and woodland Melody  XIX  " O grievous Folly to heap up Estate  " Losing the Days you see beneath the Sun  " When sudden comes blind unrelenting Fate  " And gives th' untasted Portion you have won  " With ruthless Toil and many a Wretch undone  " To Those who mock you gone to  Pluto  's Reign  " There with sad Ghosts to pine and Shadows dun  " But sure it is of Vanities most vain  " To toil for what you here untoiling may obtain"  XX  He ceas'd But still their trembling Ears retain'd  The deep Vibrations of his witching Song  That by a Kind of Magic Power constrain'd  To enter in pellmell the listening Throng  Heaps pour'd on Heaps and yet they slip'd along  In silent Ease as when beneath the Beam  Of SummerMoons the distant Woods among  Or by some Flood all silver'd with the Gleam  The softembodied Fays through airy Portal stream  XXI  By the smooth Demon so it order'd was  And here his baneful Bounty first began  Though some there were who would not further pass  And his alluring Baits suspected han  The Wise distrust the too fairspoken Man  Yet through the Gate they cast a wishful Eye  Not to move on perdie is all they can  For do their very Best they cannot fly  But often each Way look and often sorely sigh  XXII  When this the watchful wicked Wizard saw  With sudden Spring he leap'd upon them strait  And soon as touch'd by his unhallow'd Paw  They found themselves within the cursed Gate  Full hard to be repass'd like That of Fate  Not stronger were of old the GiantCrew  Who sought to pull high  Jove  from regal State  Though feeble Wretch he seem'd of sallow Hue  Certes who bides his Grasp will that Encounter rue  XXIII  For whomsoe'er the Villain takes in Hand  Their Joints unknit their Sinews melt apace  As lithe they grow as any WillowWand  And of their vanish'd Force remains no Trace  So when a Maiden fair of modest Grace  In all her buxom blooming May of Charms  Is seized in some Losel's hot Embrace  She waxeth very weakly as she warms  Then sighing yields Her up to Love's delicious Harms  XXIV  Wak'd by the Croud slow from his Bench arose  A comely fullspred Porter swoln with Sleep  His calm broad thoughtless Aspect breath'd Repose  And in sweet Torpor he was plunged deep  Ne could himself from ceaseless Yawning keep  While o'er his Eyes the drowsy Liquor ran  Through which his halfwak'd Soul would faintly peep  Then taking his black Staff he call'd his Man  And rous'd himself as much as rouse himself he can  XXV  The Lad leap'd lightly at his Master's Call  He was to weet a little roguish Page  Save Sleep and Play who minded nought at all  Like most the untaught Striplings of his Age  This Boy he kept each Band to disengage  Garters and Buckles Task for him unfit  But illbecoming his grave Personage  And which his portly Paunch would not permit  So this same limber Page to All performed It  XXVI  Mean time the MasterPorter wide display'd  Great Store of Caps of Slippers and of Gowns  Wherewith he Those who enter'd in array'd  Loose as the Breeze that plays along the Downs  And waves the SummerWoods when Evening frowns  O fair Undress best Dress it checks no Vein  But every flowing Limb in Pleasure drowns  And heightens Ease with Grace This done right fain  Sir Porter sat him down and turn'd to Sleep again  XXVII  Thus easyrob'd they to the Fountain sped  That in the Middle of the Court upthrew  A Stream highspouting from its liquid Bed  And falling back again in drizzly Dew  There Each deep Draughts as deep he thirsted drew  It was a Fountain of  Nepenthe  rare  Whence as Dan HOMER sings huge Pleasaunce grew  And sweet Oblivion of vile earthly Care  Fair gladsome waking Thoughts and joyous Dreams more fair  XXVIII  This Rite perform'd All inly pleas'd and still  Withouten Tromp was Proclamation made  " Ye Sons of INDOLENCE do what you will  " And wander where you list through Hall or Glade  " Be no Man's Pleasure for another's staid  " Let Each as likes him best his Hours employ  " And curs'd be he who minds his Neighbour's Trade  " Here dwells kind Ease and unreproving Joy  " He little merits Bliss who Others can annoy  XXIX  Strait of these endless Numbers swarming round  As thick as idle Motes in sunny Ray  Not one eftsoons in View was to be found  But every Man stroll'd off his own glad Way  Wide o'er this ample Court's blank Area  With all the Lodges that thereto pertain'd  No living Creature could be seen to stray  While Solitude and perfect Silence reign'd  So that to think you dreamt you almost was constrain'd  XXX  As when a Shepherd of the  Those Islands on the western Coast of  Scotland  called the  Hebrides  HebridIsles    Plac'd far amid the melancholy Main  Whether it be lone Fancy him beguiles  Or that aerial Beings sometimes deign  To stand embodied to our Senses plain  Sees on the naked Hill or Valley low  The whilst in Ocean  Phoebus  dips his Wain  A vast Assembly moving to and fro  Then all at once in Air dissolves the wondrous Show  XXXI  Ye Gods of Quiet and of Sleep profound  Whose soft Dominion o'er this Castle sways  And all the widelysilent Places round  Forgive me if my trembling Pen displays  What never yet was sung in mortal Lays  But how shall I attempt such arduous String  I who have spent my Nights and nightly Days  In this Souldeadening Place looseloitering  Ah how shall I for this uprear my moulted Wing  XXXII  Come on my Muse nor stoop to low Despair  Thou Imp of  Jove  touch'd by celestial Fire  Thou yet shalt sing of War and Actions fair  Which the bold Sons of BRITAIN will inspire  Of ancient Bards thou yet shalt sweep the Lyre  Thou yet shalt tread in Tragic Pall the Stage  Paint Love's enchanting Woes the Heroe's Ire  The Sage's Calm the Patriot's noble Rage  Dashing Corruption down through every worthless Age  XXXIII  The Doors that knew no shrill alarming Bell  Ne cursed Knocker ply'd by Villain's Hand  Selfopen'd into Halls where who can tell  What Elegance and Grandeur wide expand  The Pride of  Turkey  and of  Persia  Land  Soft Quilts on Quilts on Carpets Carpets spread  And Couches stretch around in seemly Band  And endless Pillows rise to prop the Head  So that each spacious Room was one fullswelling Bed  XXXIV  And every where huge cover'd Tables stood  With Wines highflavour'd and rich Viands crown'd  Whatever sprightly Juice or tasteful Food  On the green Bosom of this Earth are found  And all old Ocean genders in his Round  Some Hand unseen These silently display'd  Even undemanded by a Sign or Sound  You need but wish and instantly obey'd  Fairrang'd the Dishes rose and thick the Glasses play'd  XXXV  Here Freedom reign'd without the least Alloy  Nor Gossip's Tale nor ancient Maiden's Gall  Nor saintly Spleen durst murmur at our Joy  And with envenom'd Tongue our Pleasures pall  For why There was but One great Rule for All  To wit That each should work his own Desire  And eat drink study sleep as it may fall  Or melt the Time in Love or wake the Lyre  And carol what unbid the Muses might inspire  XXXVI  The Rooms with costly Tapestry were hung  Where was inwoven many a gentle Tale  Such as of old the rural Poets sung  Or of  Arcadian  or  Sicilian  Vale  Reclining Lovers in the lonely Dale  Pour'd forth at large the sweetlytortur'd Heart  Or looking tender Passion swell'd the Gale  And taught charm'd Echo to resound their Smart  While Flocks Woods Streams around Repose and Peace impart  XXXVII  Those pleas'd the most where by a cunning Hand  Depainted was the Patriarchal Age  What Time Dan  Abraham  left the  Chaldee  Land  And pastur'd on from verdant Stage to Stage  Where Fields and Fountains fresh could best engage  Toil was not then Of nothing took they Heed  But with wild Beasts the silvan War to wage  And o'er vast Plains their Herds and Flocks to feed  Blest Sons of Nature they True Golden Age indeed  XXXVIII  Sometimes the Pencil in cool airy Halls  Bade the gay Bloom of Vernal Landskips rise  Or Autumn's varied Shades imbrown the Walls  Now the black Tempest strikes the astonish'd Eyes  Now down the Steep the flashing Torrent flies  The trembling Sun now plays o'er Ocean blue  And now rude Mountains frown amid the Skies  Whate'er  Lorrain  lighttouch'd with softening Hue  Or savage  Rosa  dash'd or learned  Poussin  drew  XXXIX  Each Sound too here to Languishment inclin'd  Lull'd the weak Bosom and induced Ease  Aerial Music in the warbling Wind  At Distance rising oft by small Degrees  Nearer and nearer came till o'er the Trees  It hung and breath'd such Souldissolving Airs  As did alas with soft Perdition please  Entangled deep in its enchanting Snares  The listening Heart forgot all Duties and all Cares  XL  A certain Musick never known before  Here lull'd the pensive melancholy Mind  Full easily obtain'd Behoves no more  But sidelong to the gentlywaving Wind  To lay the welltun'd Instrument reclin'd  From which with airy flying Fingers light  Beyond each mortal Touch the most refin'd  The God of Winds drew Sounds of deep Delight  Whence with just Cause  This is not an Imagination of the Author there being in fact such an Instrument called  Aeolus  's  Harp  which when placed against a little Rushing or Current of Air produces the Effect here described  The Harp of Aeolus  it hight  XLI  Ah me what Hand can touch the Strings so fine  Who up the lofty Diapasan roll  Such sweet such sad such solemn Airs divine  Then let them down again into the Soul  Now rising Love they fan'd now pleasing Dole  They breath'd in tender Musings through the Heart  And now a graver sacred Strain they stole  As when Seraphic Hands an Hymn impart  Wild warbling Nature all above the Reach of Art  XLII  Such the gay Splendor the luxurious State  Of  Caliphs  old who on the  Tygris  ' Shore  In mighty  Bagdat  populous and great  Held their bright Court where was of Ladies store  And Verse Love Music still the Garland wore  When Sleep was coy  The  Arabian Caliphs  had Poets among the Officers of their Court whose Office it was to do what is here mentioned  the Bard in Waiting there  Chear'd the lone Midnight with the Muse's Lore  Composing Music bade his Dreams be fair  And Music lent new Gladness to the Morning Air  XLIII  Near the Pavilions where we slept still ran  Softtinkling Streams and dashing Waters fell  And sobbing Breezes sigh'd and oft began  So work'd the Wizard wintry Storms to swell  As Heaven and Earth they would together mell  At Doors and Windows threatening seem'd to call  The Demons of the Tempest growling fell  Yet the least Entrance found they none at all  Whence sweeter grew our Sleep secure in massy Hall  XLIV  And hither  Morpheus  sent his kindest Dreams  Raising a World of gayer Tinct and Grace  O'er which were shadowy cast Elysian Gleams  That play'd in waving Lights from Place to Place  And shed a roseate Smile on Nature's Face  Not  Titian  's Pencil e'er could so array  So fleece with Clouds the pure Etherial Space  Ne could it e'er such melting Forms display  As loose on flowery Beds all languishingly lay  XLV  No fair Illusions artful Phantoms no  My Muse will not attempt your FairyLand  She has no Colours that like you can glow  To catch your vivid Scenes too gross her Hand  But sure it is was ne'er a subtler Band  Than these same guileful Angelseeming Sprights  Who thus in Dreams voluptuous soft and bland  Pour'd all th'  Arabian Heaven  upon our Nights  And bless'd them oft besides with more refin'd Delights  XLVI  They were in Sooth a most enchanting Train  Even feigning Virtue skilful to unite  With Evil Good and strew with Pleasure Pain  But for those Fiends whom Blood and Broils delight  Who hurl the Wretch as if to Hell outright  Down down black Gulphs where sullen Waters sleep  Or hold him clambering all the fearful Night  On beetling Cliffs or pent in Ruins deep  They till due Time should serve were bid far hence to keep  XLVII  Ye Guardian Spirits to whom Man in dear  From these foul Demons shield the Midnight Gloom  Angels of Fancy and of Love be near  And o'er the Blank of Sleep diffuse a Bloom  Evoke the sacred Shades of  Greece  and  Rome    And let them Virtue with a Look impart  But chief a while o lend us from the Tomb  Those longlost Friends for whom in Love we smart  And fill with pious Awe and Joymixt Woe the Heart  XLVIII  Or are you sportiveBid the Morn of Youth  Rise to new Light and beam afresh the Days  Of Innocence Simplicity and Truth  To Cares estrang'd and Manhood's thorny Ways  What Transport To retrace our boyish Plays  Our easy Bliss when each Thing Joy supply'd  The Woods the Mountains and the warbling Maze  Of the wild BrooksBut fondly wandering wide  My Muse resume the Task that yet doth thee abide  XLIX  One great Amusement of our Houshold was  In a huge crystal magic Globe to spy  Still as you turn'd it all Things that do pass  Upon this AntHill Earth where constantly  Of idlybusy Men the restless Fry  Run bustling too and fro with foolish Haste  In search of Pleasures vain that from them fly  Or which obtain'd the Caitiffs dare not taste  When nothing is enjoy'd can there be greater Waste  L  Of Vanity the Mirror  This was call'd  Here you a Muckworm of the Town might see  At his dull Desk amid his Legers stall'd  Eat up with carking Care and Penurie  Most like to Carcase parch'd on Gallow Tree  A Penny saved is a Penny got  Firm to this scoundrel Maxim keepeth he  Ne of its Rigour will he bate a Jot  Till it has quench'd his Fire and banished his Pot  LI  Strait from the Filth of this low Grub behold  Comes fluttering forth a gaudy spendthrift Heir  All glossy gay enamel'd all with Gold  The silly Tenant of the SummerAir  In Folly lost of Nothing takes he Care  Pimps Lawyers Stewards Harlots Flatterers vile  And thieving Tradesmen him among them share  His Father's Ghost from LimboLake the while  Sees This which more Damnation does upon him pile  LII  This Globe pourtray'd the Race of learned Men  Still at their Books and turning o'er the Page  Backwards and forwards oft they snatch the Pen  As if inspir'd and in a  Thespian  Rage  Then write and blot as would your Ruth engage  Why Auhors all this Scrawl and Scribbling sore  To lose the present gain the future Age  Praised to be when you can hear no more  And much enrich'd with Fame when useless worldly Store  LIII  Then would a splendid City rise to View  With Carts and Cars and Coaches roaring all  Widepour'd abroad behold the prowling Crew  See how they dash along from Wall to Wall  At every Door hark how they thundering call  Good Lord what can this giddy Rout excite  Why On each other with fell Tooth to fall  A Neighbour's Fortune Fame or Peace to blight  And make new tiresome Parties for the coming Night  LIV  The puzzling Sons of Party next appear'd  In dark Cabals and nightly Juntos met  And now they whisper'd close new shrugging rear'd  Th' important Shoulder then as if to get  New Light their twinkling Eyes were inward set  No sooner  The Morning Star  Lucifer  recalls Affairs  Than forth they various rush in mighty Fret  When lo push'd up to Power and crown'd their Cares  In comes another Set and kicketh them down Stairs  LV  But what most shew'd the Vanity of Life  Was to behold the Nations all on Fire  In cruel Broils engag'd and deadly Strife  Most Christian Kings inflam'd by black Desire  With Honourable Russians in their Hire  Cause War to rage and Blood around to pour  Of this sad Work when Each begins to tire  They sit them down just where they were before  Till for new Scenes of Woe Peace shall their Force restore  LVI  To number up the Thousands dwelling here  An useless were and eke an endless Task  From Kings and Those who at the Helm appear  To Gipsies brown in SummerGlades who bask  Yea many a Man perdie I could unmask  Whose Desk and Table make a solemn Show  With Tapety'd Trash and Suits of Fools that ask  For Place or Pension laid in decent Row  But These I passen by with nameless Numbers moe  LVII  Of all the gentle Tenants of the Place  There was a Man of special grave Remark  A certain tender Gloom o'erspread his Face  Pensive not sad in Thought involv'd not dark  As soot this Man could sing as MorningLark  And teach the noblest Morals of the Heart  But These his Talents were ybury'd stark  Of the fine Stores he Nothing would impart  Which or boon Nature gave or Naturepainting Art  LVIII  To Noontide Shades incontinent he ran  Where purls the Brook with Sleepinviting Sound  Or when Dan  Sol  to slope his Wheels began  Amid the Broom he bask'd him on the Ground  Where the wild Thyme and Camomil are found  There would he linger till the latest Ray  Of Light sat trembling on the Welkin's Bound  Then homeward through the twilight Shadows stray  Sauntring and slow So had he passed many a Day  LIX  Yet not in thoughtless Slumber were they past  For oft the heavenly Fire that lay conceal'd  Beneath the sleeping Embers mounted fast  And all its native Light anew reveal'd  Oft as he travers'd the Cerulean Field  And mark'd the Clouds that drove before the Wind  Ten thousand glorious Systems would he build  Ten thousand great Ideas fill'd his Mind  But with the Clouds they fled and left no Tract behind  LX  With him was sometimes join'd in silent Walk  Profoundly silent for they never spoke  One shyer still who quite detested Talk  Oft stung by Spleen at once away he broke  To Groves of Pine and broad o'ershadowing Oak  There inly thrill'd he wander'd all alone  And on himself his pensive Fury wroke  Ne ever utter'd Word save when first shone  The glittering Star of Eve "Thank Heaven the Day is done"  LXI  Here lurk'd a Wretch who had not crept abroad  For forty Years ne Face of Mortal seen  In Chamber brooding like a loathly Toad  And sure his Linnen was not very clean  Through secret LoopHole that had practis'd been  Near to his Bed his Dinner vile he took  Unkempt and rough of squalid Face and Mein  Our Castle's shame whence from his filthy Nook  We drove the Villain out for fitter Lair to look  LXII  One Day there chaunc'd into these Halls to rove  A joyous Youth who took you at first Sight  Him the wild Wave of Pleasure hither drove  Before the sprightly Tempest tossing light  Certes he was a most engaging Wight  Of social Glee and Wit humane though keen  Turning the Night to Day and Day to Night  For him the merry Bells had rung I ween  If in this Nook of Quiet Bells had ever been  LXIII  But not even Pleasure to Excess is good  What most elates then sinks the Soul as low  When SpringTide Joy pours in with copious Flood  The higher still th' exulting Billows flow  The farther back again they flagging go  And leave us groveling on the dreary Shore  Taught by this Son of Joy we found it so  Who whilst he staid kept in a gay Uproar  Our madden'd Castle all th' Abode of Sleep no more  LXIV  As when in Prime of June a burnish'd Fly  Sprung from the Meads o'er which he sweeps along  Chear'd by the breathing Bloom and vital Sky  Tunes up amid these airy Halls his Song  Soothing at first the gay reposing Throng  And oft he sips their Bowl or nearly drown'd  He thence recovering drives their Beds among  And scares their tender Sleep with Trump profound  Then out again he flies to wing his mazy Round  LXV  Another Guest there was of Sense refin'd  Who felt each Worth for every Worth he had  Serene yet warm humane yet firm his Mind  As little touch'd as any Man's with Bad  Him through their inmost Walks the Muses lad  To him the sacred Love of Nature lent  And sometimes would he make our Valley glad  Whenas we found he would not here be pent  To him the better Sort this friendly Message sent  LXVI  " Come dwell with us true Son of Virtue come  " But if alas we cannot Thee persuade  " To lie content beneath our peaceful Dome  " Ne ever more to quit our quiet Glade  " Yet when at last thy Toils but ill apaid  " Shall dead thy Fire and damp its Heavenly Spark  " Thou wilt be glad to seek the rural Shade  " There to indulge the Muse and Nature mark  " We then a Lodge for Thee will rear in HAGLEYPARK"  LXVII  Here whilom ligg'd th' ESOPUS of the Age  But call'd by Fame in Soul ypricked deep  A noble Pride restor'd him to the Stage  And rous'd him like a Gyant from his Sleep  Even from his Slumbers we Advantage reap  With double Force th' enliven'd Scene he wakes  Yet quits not Nature's Bounds He knows to keep  Each due Decorum Now the Heart he shakes  And now with wellurg'd Sense th'enlighten'd Judgment takes  LXVIII  A Bard here dwelt more fat than Bard beseems  The following Lines of this Stanza were writ by a Friend of the Author  Who void of Envy Guile and Lust of Gain  On Virtue still and Nature's pleasing Themes  Pour'd forth his unpremeditated Strain  The World forsaking with a calm Disdain  Here laugh'd he careless in his easy Seat  Here quaff'd encircled with the joyous Train  Oft moralizing sage his ditty sweet  He loathed much to write ne cared to repeat  LXIX  Full oft by Holy Feet our Ground was trod  Of Clerks good Plenty here you mote espy  A little round fat oily Man of God  Was one I chiefly mark'd among the Fry  He had a roguish Twinkle in his Eye  And shone all glittering with ungodly Dew  If a tight Damsel chaunc'd to trippen by  Which when observ'd he shrunk into his Mew  And strait would recollect his Piety anew  LXX  Nor be forgot a Tribe who minded Nought  Old Inmates of the Place but StateAffairs  They look'd perdie as if they deeply thought  And on their Brow sat every Nation's Cares  The World by them is parcel'd out in Shares  When in the  Hall of Smoak  they Congress hold  And the sage Berry sunburnt  Mocha  bears  Has clear'd their inward Eye then smoakenroll'd  Their Oracles break forth mysterious as of old  LXXI  Here languid Beauty kept her palefac'd Court  Bevies of dainty Dames of high Degree  From every Quarter hither made Resort  Where from gross mortal Care and Business free  They lay pour'd out in Ease and Luxury  Or should they a vain Shew of Work assume  Alas and welladay what can it be  To knot to twist to range the vernal Bloom  But far is cast the Distaff SpinningWheel and Loom  LXXII  Their only Labour was to kill the Time  And Labour dire it is and weary Woe  They sit they loll turn o'er some idle Rhyme  Then rising sudden to the Glass they go  Or saunter forth with tottering Step and slow  This soon too rude an Exercise they find  Strait on the Couch their Limbs again they throw  Where Hours on Hours they sighing lie reclin'd  And court the vapoury God softbreathing in the Wind  LXXIII  Now must I mark the Villainy we found  But ah too late as shall estsoons be shewn  A Place here was deep dreary under Ground  Where still our Inmates when unpleasing grown  Diseas'd and loathsome privily were thrown  Far from the Light of Heaven they languish'd there  Unpity'd uttering many a bitter Groan  For of these Wretches taken was no Care  Fierce Fiends and Hags of Hell their only Nurses were  LXXIV  Alas the Change from Scenes of Joy and Rest  To this dark Den where Sickness toss'd alway  Here  Lethargy  with deadly Sleep opprest  Stretch'd on his Back a mighty Lubbard lay  Heaving his Sides and snored Night and Day  To stir him from his Traunce it was not eath  And his halfopen'd Eyne he shut strait way  He led I wot the softest Way to Death  And taught withouten Pain and Strife to yield the Breath  LXXV  Of Limbs enormous but withal unsound  Softswoln and pale here lay the  Hydropsy  Unwieldy Man with Belly monstrous round  For ever fed with watery Supply  For still he drank and yet he still was dry  And here a moping Mystery did sit  Mother of Spleen in Robes of various Dye  Who vexed was full oft with ugly Fit  And some Her frantic deem'd and some Her deem'd a Wit  LXXVI  A Lady proud she was of ancient Blood  Yet oft her Fear her Pride made crouchen low  She felt or fancy'd in her fluttering Mood  All the Diseases which the Spittles know  And sought all Physick which the Shops bestow  And still new Leaches and new Drugs would try  Her Humour ever wavering to and fro  For sometimes she would laugh and sometimes cry  Then sudden waxed wroth and all she knew not why  LXXVII  Fast by her Side a listless Maiden pin'd  With aching Head and squeamish HeartBurnings  Pale bloated cold she seem'd to hate Mankind  Yet lov'd in Secret all forbidden Things  And here the  Tertian  shakes his chilling Wings  The sleepless  Gout  here counts the crowing Cocks  A Wolf now gnaws him now a Serpent stings  Whilst  Apoplexy  cramm'd Intemperance knocks  Down to the Ground at once as Butcher felleth Ox  CANTO II  The Knight of Arts and Industry  And his Atchievements fair  That by this Castle's Overthrow  Secur'd and crowned were  I  ESCAP'D the Castle of the Sire of Sin  Ah where shall I so sweet a Dwelling find  For all around without and all within  Nothing save what delightful was and kind  Of Goodness savouring and a tender Mind  E'er rose to View But now another Strain  Of doleful Note alas remains behind  I now must sing of Pleasure turn'd to Pain  And of the false Inchanter INDOLENCE complain  II  Is there no Patron to protect the Muse  And fence for Her  Parnassus  ' barren Soil  To every Labour its Reward accrues  And they are sure of Bread who swink and moil  But a fell Tribe  th' Aonian Hive  despoil  As ruthless Wasps oft rob the painful Bee  Thus while the Laws not guard that noblest Toil  Ne for the Muses other Meed decree  They praised are alone and starve right merrily  III  I care not Fortune what you me deny  You cannot rob me of free Nature's Grace  You cannot shut the Windows of the Sky  Through which  Aurora  shews her brightening Face  You cannot bar my constant Feet to trace  The Woods and Lawns by living Stream at Eve  Let Health my Nerves and finer Fibres brace  And I their Toys to the  great Children  leave  Of Fancy Reason Virtue nought can me bereave  IV  Come then my Muse and raise a bolder Song  Come lig no more upon the Bed of Sloth  Dragging the lazy languid Line along  Fond to begin but still to finish loth  Thy halfwrit Scrolls all eaten by the Moth  Arise and sing that generous Imp of Fame  Who with the Sons of Softness nobly wroth  To sweep away this Human Lumber came  Or in a chosen Few to rouse the slumbering Flame  V  In  FairyLand  there liv'd a Knight of old  Of Feature stern  Selvaggio  well yclep'd  A rough unpolish'd Man robust and bold  But wondrous poor he neither sow'd nor reap'd  Ne Stores in Summer for cold Winter heap'd  In Hunting all his Days away he wore  Now scorch'd by June now in November steep'd  Now pinch'd by biting January sore  He still in Woods pursu'd the Libbard and the Boar  VI  As he one Morning long before the Dawn  Prick'd through the Forest to dislodge his Prey  Deep in the winding Bosom of a Lawn  With Wood wildfring'd he mark'd a Taper's Ray  That from the beating Rain and wintry Fray  Did to a lonely Cott his Steps decoy  There up to earn the Needments of the Day  He found Dame  Poverty  nor fair nor coy  Her he compress'd and fill'd Her with a lusty Boy  VII  Amid the greenwood Shade this Boy was bred  And grew at last a Knight of muchel Fame  Of active Mind and vigorous Lustyhed  THE KNIGHT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRY by Name  Earth was his Bed the Boughs his Roof did frame  He knew no Beverage but the flowing Stream  His tasteful wellearn'd Food the silvan Game  Or the brown Fruit with which the WoodLands teem  The same to him glad Summer or the Winter breme  VIII  So pass'd his youthly Morning void of Care  Wild as the Colts that through the Commons run  For him no tender Parents troubled were  He of the Forest seem'd to be the Son  And certes had been utterly undone  But that  Minerva  Pity of him took  With all the Gods that love the Rural Wonne  That teach to tame the Soil and rule the Crook  Ne did the sacred Nine disdain a gentle Look  IX  Of fertile Genius him they nurtur'd well  In every Science and in every Art  By which Mankind the thoughtless Brutes excel  That can or Use or Joy or Grace impart  Disclosing all the Powers of Head and Heart  Ne were the goodly Exercises spar'd  That brace the Nerves or make the Limbs alert  And mix elastic Force with Firmness hard  Was never Knight on Ground mote be with him compar'd  X  Sometimes with early Morn he mounted gay  The Huntersteed exulting o'er the Dale  And drew the roseat Breath of orient Day  Sometimes retiring to the secret Vale  Yclad in Steel and bright with burnish'd Mail  He strain'd the Bow or toss'd the sounding Spear  Or darting on the Goal outstrip'd the Gale  Or wheel'd the Chariot in its MidCareer  Or strenuous wrestled hard with many a tough Compeer  XI  At other Times he pry'd through Nature's Store  Whate'er she in th' Etherial Round contains  Whate'er she hides beneath her verdant Floor  The vegetable and the mineral Reigns  Or else he scann'd the  Globe  those small Domains  Where restless Mortals such a Turmoil keep  Its Seas its Floods its Mountains and its Plains  But more he search'd the Mind and rous'd from Sleep  Those moral Seeds whence we heroic Actions reap  XII  Nor would he scorn to stoop from high Pursuits  Of heavenly Truth and practise what she taught  Vain is the Tree of Knowledge without Fruits  Sometimes in Hand the Spade or Plough he caught  Forthcalling all with which boon Earth is fraught  Sometimes he ply'd the strong mechanic Tool  Or rear'd the Fabrick from the finest Draught  And oft he put himself to  Neptune  's School  Fighting with Winds and Waves on the vext Ocean Pool  XIII  To solace then these rougher Toils he try'd  To touch the kindling Canvass into Life  With Nature his creating Pencil vy'd  With Nature joyous at the mimic Strife  Or to such Shapes as grac'd  Pygmalion  's Wife  He hew'd the Marble or with vary'd Fire  He rous'd the Trumpet and the martial Fife  Or bad the Lute sweet Tenderness inspire  Or Verses fram'd that well might wake  Apollo  's Lyre  XIV  Accomplish'd thus he from the Woods issu'd  Full of great Aims and bent on bold Emprize  The Work which long he in his Breast had brew'd  Now to perform he ardent did devise  Towit a barbarous World to civilize  Earth was till Then a boundless Forest wild  Nought to be seen but savage Wood and Skies  No Cities nourish'd Arts no Culture smil'd  No Government no Laws no gentle Manners mild  XV  A rugged Wight the Worst of Brutes was Man  On his own wretched Kind he ruthless prey'd  The Strongest still the Weakest overran  In every Country mighty Robbers sway'd  And Guile and ruffian Force were all their Trade▪  Life was not Life but Rapine Want and Woe  Which this brave Knight in noble Anger made  To swear he would the rascal Rout o'erthrow  For by the Powers Divine it should no more be so  XVI  It would exceed the Purport of my Song  To say how this  best Sun  from orient Climes  Came beaming Life and Beauty all along  Before him chasing Indolence and Crimes  Still as he pass'd the Nations he sublimes  And calls forth Arts and Virtue with his Ray  Then  Egypt    Greece  and  Rome  their Golden Times  Successive had but now in Ruins grey  They lie to slavish Sloth and Tyranny a Prey  XVII  To crown his Toils SIR INDUSTRY then spred  The swelling Sail and made for BRITAIN'S Coast  A Sylvan Life till Then the Natives led  In the brown Shades and greenwood Forest lost  All careless rambling where it lik'd them most  Their Wealth the WildDeer bouncing through the Glade  They lodg'd at large and liv'd at Nature's Cost  Save Spear and Bow withouten other Aid  Yet not the  Roman  Steel their naked Breast dismay'd  XVIII  He lik'd the Soil he lik'd the clement Skies  He lik'd the verdant Hills and flowery Plains  Be This my great my chosen Isle he cries  This whilst my Labours LIBERTY sustains  This Queen of Ocean all Assault disdains  Nor lik'd he less the Genius of the Land  To Freedom apt and persevering Pains  Mild to obey and generous to command  Temper'd by forming HEAVEN with kindest firmest Hand  XIX  Here by Degrees his MasterWork arose  Whatever Arts and Industry can frame  Whatever finish'd Agriculture knows  Fair Queen of Arts from Heaven itself who came  When  Eden  flourish'd in unspotted Fame  And still with Her sweet Innocence we find  And tender Peace and Joys without a Name  That while they rapture tranquillize the Mind  Nature and Art at once Delight and Use combin'd  XX  Then Towns he quicken'd by mechanic Arts  And bade the fervent City glow with Toil  Bade social Commerce raise renowned Marts  Join Land to Land and marry Soil to Soil  Unite the Poles and without bloody Spoil  Bring home of either  Ind  the gorgeous Stores  Or should Despotic Rage the World embroil  Bade Tyrants tremble on remotest Shores  While o'er th'encircling Deep BRITANNIA'S Thunder roars  XXI  The drooping Muses then he westward call'd  From the fam'd City  Constantinople  by  Propontis  Sea  What Time the  Turk  th'enfeebled  Grecian  thrall'd  Thence from their cloister'd Walks he set them free  And brought them to another  Castalie  Where  Isis  many a famous Noursling breeds  Or where old  Cam  softpaces o'er the Lea  In pensive Mood and tunes his  Doric  Reeds  The whilst his Flocks at large the lonely Shepherd feeds  XXII  Yet the fine Arts were what he finish'd least  For why They are the Quintessence of All  The Growth of labouring Time and slow increast  Unless as seldom chances it should fall  That mighty Patrons the coy Sisters call  Up to the Sunshine of uncumber'd Ease  Where no rude Care the mounting Thought may thrall  And where they nothing have to do but please  Ah gracious God thou know'st they ask no other Fees  XXIII  But now alas we live too late in Time  Our Patrons now even grudge that little Claim  Except to such as sleek the soothing Rhyme  And yet forsooth they wear MAECENAS' Name  Poor Sons of puftup Vanity not Fame  Unbroken Spirits chear still still remains  Th'  Eternal Patron  LIBERTY whose Flame  While she protects inspires the noblest Strains  The best and sweetest far are Toilcreated Gains  XXIV  Whenas the Knight had fram'd in BRITAINLAND  A matchless Form of glorious Government  In which the sovereign Laws alone command  Laws stablish'd by the public free Consent  Whose Majesty is to the Sceptre lent  When this great Plan with each dependent Art  Was settled firm and to his Heart's Content  Then sought he from the toilsome Scene to part  And let Life's vacant Eve breathe Quiet through the Heart  XXV  For This he chose a Farm in  Deva  's Vale  Where his long Alleys peep'd upon the Main  In this calm Seat he drew the healthful Gale  Commix'd the Chief the Patriot and the Swain  The happy Monarch of his Sylvan Train  Here sided by the Guardians of the Fold  He walk'd his Rounds and chear'd his blest Domain  His Days the Days of unstain'd Nature roll'd  Replete with Peace and Joy like Patriarch's of old  XXVI  Witness ye lowing Herds who lent him Milk  Witness ye Flocks whose woolly Vestments far  Exceed soft  India  's Cotton or her Silk  Witness with Autumn charg'd the nodding Car  That homeward came beneath sweet Evening's Star  Or of septemberMoons the Radiance mild  O hide thy Head abominable War  Of Crimes and ruffian Idleness the Child  From Heaven this Life ysprung from Hell thy Glories vild  XXVII  Nor from his deep Retirement banish'd was  Th' amusing Cares of Rural Industry  Still as with grateful Change the Seasons pass  New Scenes arise new Landskips strike the Eye  And all th' enliven'd Country beautify  Gay Plains extend where Marshes slept before  O'er recent Meads th' exulting Streamlets fly  Dark frowning Heaths grow bright with Ceres' store  And Woods imbrown the Steep or wave along the Shore  XXVIII  As nearer to his Farm you made Approach  He polish'd Nature with a finer Hand  Yet on her Beauties durst not Art incroach  'Tis Art's alone these Beauties to expand  In graceful Dance immingled o'er the Land  Pan    Pales    Flora  and  Pomona  play'd  Even here sometimes the rude wild Common fand  An happy Place where free and unafraid  Amid the flowering Brakes each coyer Creature stray'd  XXIX  But in prime Vigour what can last for ay  That soulenfeebling Wizard INDOLENCE  I whilom sung wrought in his Works decay  Spred far and wide was his curs'd Influence  Of Public Virtue much he dull'd the Sense  Even much of Private eat our Spirit out  And fed our rank luxurious Vices whence  The Land was overlaid with many a Lout  Not as old Fame reports wise generous bold and stout  XXX  A Rage of Pleasure madden'd every Breast  Down to the lowest Lees the Ferment ran  To his licentious Wish Each must be blest  With Joy be fever'd snatch it as he can  Thus  Vice  the Standard rear'd her ArrierBan  Corruption  call'd and loud she gave the Word  " Mind mind yourselves Why should the vulgar Man  " The Lacquey be more virtuous than his Lord  " Enjoy this Span of Life 'tis all the Gods afford"  XXXI  The Tidings reach'd to Where in quiet Hall  The good old Knight enjoy'd wellearn'd Repose  " Come come Sir Knight thy Children on thee call  " Come save us yet ere Ruin round us close  " The Demon INDOLENCE thy Toils o'erthrows"  On This the noble Colour stain'd his Cheeks  Indignant glowing through the whitening Snows  Of venerable Eld his Eye full speaks  His ardent Soul and from his Couch at once he breaks  XXXII  I will he cry'd so help me God destroy  That Villain ArchimageHis Page then strait  He to him call'd a fieryfooted Boy  Benempt  Dispatch  "My Steed be at the Gate  " My Bard attend quick bring the Net of Fate"  This Net was twisted by the Sisters Three  Which when once cast o'er harden'd Wretch too late  Repentance comes Replevy cannot be  From the strong iron Grasp of vengeful Destiny  XXXIII  He came the Bard a little DruidWight  Of wither'd Aspect but his Eye was keen  With Sweetness mix'd In Russet brown bedight  As is his Sister of the Copses green  He crept along unpromising of Mien  Gross he who judges so His Soul was fair  Bright as the Children of yon Azure sheen  True Comeliness which nothing can impair  Dwells in the Mind all else is Vanity and Glare  XXXIV  Come quoth the Knight a Voice has reach'd mine Ear  The Demon INDOLENCE threats Overthrow  To All that to Mankind is good and dear  Come PHILOMELUS let us instant go  O'erturn his Bowers and lay his Castle low  Those Men those wretched Men who  will  be Slaves  Must drink a bitter wrathful Cup of Woe  But some there be thy Song as from their Graves  Shall raise Thrice happy he who without Rigour saves  XXXV  Issuing forth the Knight bestrode his Steed  Of ardent Bay and on whose Front a Star  Shone blazing bright Sprung from the generous Breed  That whirl of active Day the rapid Car  He pranc'd along disdaining Gate or Bar  Meantime the Bard on milkwhite Palfrey rode  An honest sober Beast that did not mar  His Meditations but full softly trode  And much they moraliz'd as thus yfere they yode  XXXVI  They talk'd of Virtue and of Human Bliss  What else so fit for Man to settle well  And still their long Researches met in This  This  Truth of Truths  which nothing can refel  " From Virtue's Fount the purest Joys outwell  " Sweet Rills of Thought that chear the conscious Soul  " While Vice pours forth the troubled Streams of Hell  " The which howe'er disguis'd at last with Dole  " Will through the tortur'd Breast their fiery Torrent roll"  XXXVII  At length it dawn'd that fatal Valley gay  O'er which high woodcrown'd Hills their Summits rear  On the cool Height awhile our Palmers stay  And spite even of themselves their Senses chear  Then to the Wizard's Wonne their Steps they steer  Like a green Isle it broad beneath them spred  With Gardens round and wandering Currents clear  And tufted Groves to shade the MeadowBed  Sweet Airs and Song and without Hurrry all seem'd glad  XXXVIII  " As God shall judge me Knight we must forgive  The halfenraptur'd PHILOMELUS cry'd  " The frail good Man deluded here to live  " And in these Groves his musing Fancy hide  " Ah Nought is pure It cannot be deny'd  " That Virtue still some Tincture has of Vice  " And Vice of Virtue What should then betide  " But that our Charity be not too nice  " Come let us Those we can to real Bliss entice  XXXIX  " Ay sicker quoth the Knight all Flesh is frail  " To pleasant Sin and joyous Dalliance bent  " But let not brutish Vice of This avail  " And think to scape deserved Punishment  "  Justice  were cruel weakly to relent  " From  Mercy  's Self she got her sacred Glaive  " Grace be to Those who can and will repent  " But Penance long and dreary to the Slave  " Who must in Floods of Fire his gross foul Spirit lave  XL  Thus holding high Discourse they came to Where  The cursed Carle was at his wonted Trade  Still tempting heedless Men into his Snare  In witching Wise as I before have said  But when he saw in goodly Geer array'd  The grave majestic Knight approaching nigh  And by his Side the Bard so sage and staid  His Countenance fell yet ost his anxious Eye  Mark'd them like wily Fox who roosted Cock doth spy  XLI  Nathless with feign'd Respect he bade give back  The RabbleRout and welcom'd them full kind  Struck with the noble Twain they were not slack  His Orders to obey and fall behind  Then he resum'd his Song and unconfin'd  Pour'd all his Music ran through all his Strings  With magic Dust their Eyne he tries to blind  And Virtue's tender Airs o'er Weakness flings  What Pity base his Song who so divinely sings▪  XLII  Elate in Thought he counted them his own  They listen'd so intent with fix'd Delight  But they instead as if transmew'd to Stone  Marvel'd he could with such sweet Art unite  The Lights and Shades of Manners Wrong and Right  Mean time the silly Croud the Charm devour  Widepressing to the Gate Swift on the Knight  He darted fierce to drag him to his Bower  Who backning shun'd his Touch for well he knew its Power  XLIII  As in throng'd Amphitheatre of old  The wary  A Gladiator who made use of a Net which he threw over his Adversary  Retiarius  trap'd his Foe  Even so the Knight returning on him bold  At once involv'd him in the  Net of Woe    Whereof I Mention made not long ago  Inrag'd at first he scorn'd so weak a Jail  And leap'd and flew and flounced to and fro  But when he found that nothing could avail  He sat him felly down and gnaw'd his bitter Nail  XLIV  Alarm'd th' inferior Demons of the Place  Rais'd rueful Shrieks and hideous Yells around  Black ruptur'd Clouds deform'd the Welkin's Face  And from beneath was heard a wailing Sound  As of Infernal Sprights in Cavern bound  A solemn Sadness every Creature strook  And Lightnings flash'd and Horror rock'd the Ground  Huge Crouds on Crouds outpour'd with blemish'd Look  As if on Time's last Verge this Frame of Things had shook  XLV  Soon as the shortliv'd Tempest was yspent  Steam'd from the Jaws of vext Avernus' Hole  And hush'd the Hubbub of the Rabblement  SIR INDUSTRY the first calm Moment stole  " There must he cry'd amid so vast a Shoal  " Be Some who are not tainted at the Heart  " Not poison'd quite by this same Villain's Bowl  " Come then my Bard thy heavenly Fire impart  " Touch Soul with Soul till forth the latent Spirit start  XLVI  The Bard obey'd and taking from his Side  Where it in seemly Sort depending hung  His  British  Harp its speaking Strings he try'd  The which with skilful Touch he deffly strung  Till tinkling in clear Symphony they rung  Then as he felt the Muses come along  Light o'er the Chords his raptur'd Hand he flung  And play'd a Prelude to his rising Song  The whilst like Midnightmute ten Thousands round him throng  XLVII  Thus ardent burst his Strain  " Ye hapless Race  " Direlabouring here to smother Reason's Ray  " That lights our Maker's Image in our Face  " And gives us wide o'er Earth unquestion'd Sway  " What is TH' ADOR'd

their Looks a gentle Radiance lends  And with seraphic Flame Compassion blends  At once delighted to their Charge they fly  When lo a goodly Hospital ascends  In which they bade each human Aid be nigh  That could the SickBed smoothe of that unhappy Fry  LXXV  It was a worthy edifying Sight  And gives to HumanKind  peculiar  Grace  To see kind Hands attending Day and Night  With tender Ministry from Place to Place  Some prop the Head some from the pallid Face  Wipe off the faint cold Dews weak Nature sheds  Some reach the healing Draught the whilst to chase  The Fear supreme around their soften'd Beds  Some holy Man by Prayer all opening Heaven dispreds  LXXVI  Attended by a glad acclaiming Train  Of those he rescu'd had from gaping Hell  Then turn'd the Knight and to his Hall again  Softpacing sought of Peace the mossy Cell  Yet down his Cheeks the Gems of Pity fell  To see the helpless Wretches that remain'd  There left through Delves and Deserts dire to yell  Amaz'd their Looks with pale Dismay were stain'd  And spreading wide their Hands they meek Repentance feign'd  LXXVII  But ah their scorned Day of Grace was past  For Horrible to tell a Desert wild  Before them stretch'd bare comfortless and vast  With Gibbets Bones and Carcases defil'd  There nor trim Field nor lively Culture smil'd  Nor waving Shade was seen nor Fountain fair  But Sands abrupt on Sands lay loosely pil'd  Through which they floundering toil'd with painful Care  Whilst  Phaebus  smote them sore and fir'd the cloudless Air  LXXVIII  Then varying to a joyless Land of Bogs  The sadden'd Country a grey Waste appear'd  Where Nought but putrid Steams and noisome Fogs  For ever hung on drizzly  Auster  's Beard  Or else the Ground by piercing  Caurus  sear'd  Was jagg'd with Frost or heap'd with glazed Snow  Through these Extremes a ceaseless Round they steer'd  By cruel Fiends still hurry'd to and fro  Gaunt  Beggary  and  Scorn  with many HellHounds moe  LXXIX  The First was with base dunghill Rags yclad  Tainting the Gale in which they flutter'd light  Of morbid Hue his Features sunk and sad  His hollow Eyne shook forth a sickly Light  And o'er his lank JawBone in piteous Plight  His black rough Beard was matted rank and vile  Direful to see an Heartappalling Sight  Meantime foul Scurf and Blotches him defile  And Dogs wheree'er he went still barked all the While  LXXX  The other was a fell despightful Fiend  Hell holds none worse in baleful Bower below  By Pride and Wit and Rage and Rancour keen'd  Of Man alike if good or bad the Foe  With Nose upturn'd he always made a Shew  As if he smelt some nauseous Scent his Eye  Was cold and keen like Blast from boreal Snow  And Taunts he casten forth most bitterly  Such were the Twain that off drove this ungodly Fry  LXXXI  Even so through  Brentford  Town a Town of Mud  An Herd of brisly Swine is prick'd along  The filthy Beasts that never chew the Cud  Still grunt and squeak and sing their troublous Song  And oft they plunge themselves the Mire among  But ay the ruthless Driver goads them on  And ay of barking Dogs the bitter Throng  Makes them renew their unmelodious Moan  Ne ever find they Rest from their unresting Fone  FINIS  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Poem being writ in the Manner of  Spenser  the obsolete Words and a Simplicity of Diction in some of the Lines which borders on the Ludicrous were necessary to make the Imitation more perfect And the Stile of that admirable Poet as well as the Measure in which he wrote are as it were appropriated by Custom to all Allegorical Poems writ in our Language just as in French the Stile of  Marot  who lived under  Francis I  has been used in Tales and familiar Epistles by the politest Writers of the Age of  Louis XIV  EXPLANATION of the obsolete
