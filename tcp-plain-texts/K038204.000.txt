Prologue try each way  To win your Favour tow'rds the coming Play  Our Author is a Womanthat's a Charm  Of Power to guard herself and Play from harm  The Muses Ladies Regent of the Pen  Grant Women

EPILOGUE  Written by GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Miss FARREN  MALE Criticks applaud to the Skies the Male Scribblers  When a Woman attempts they turn Carpers and Nibblers  But a true Patriot Female there's nothing so vexes  As this haughty Preeminence claim'd'twixt the Sexes  The free Spirit revolts at each hard Proposition  And meets the whole System with loud Opposition  Men 'tis true in their Noddles huge Treasures may hoard  But the  Heart  of a Woman with Passions is stor'd  With Passions not copied from Latin or Greek  Which the Language of Nature in plain English speak  Girls who grieve or rejoice from true Feeling as I do  Never dream of Calypso or Helen or Dido  To the End of our Life from the Hour we begin it  Woman's Fate all depends on the Critical Minute  A Minute unknown to the dull Pedant Tribe  And which never feeling they never describe  'Tis no Work of Science or Sparkle of Wit  But a Point which mere Nature must teach us to hit  And which in the Changes and Turns of my Story  A weak Woman's Pen has tonight laid before ye  And say ye grave Prudes Gay Coquettes too ah say  What a Critical Minute was mine in the Play  Here Poverty Famine and Shame and Reproach  There Plenty and Ease and a Lord and a Coach  But perhaps our Bard held Mrs Euston too mean  And conceiv'd her Disgrace wou'd but lower the Scene  Let us then better pleas'd to acquit than convict her  On the Ground of High Life sketch the very same Picture  Imagine some Fair plung'd in modish Distress  Her Wants not less than mine nor her Agony less  At Hazard suppose an unfortunate Cast  Has swept her last Guinea nay more than her last  Her Diamonds all mortgag'd her Equipage sold  Her Husband undone genteel Friends looking cold  At her Feet his sweet Person Lord Foppington throws  The most handsome of Nobles the richest of Beaux  At once too his Love and his Bounty dispenses  Sooths with Thousands her Grief lulls with Flatt'ry her Senses  Alas what a Minute Ah What can be done  All Means must be tried and our Drama shews one  Let Papa in that Minute that so frowns upon her  Redeem the vile Debts that encumber her Honour  Let Papa in that Minute that teems with undoing  Step in like my Father and marr a Lord's wooing  Let her know as I've known all the Horror that's in it  And feel the true Force of the Critical Minute  Thus wishes our Bard as she bids me declare  And such is my Wish by my  Honour  I swear  I'LL TELL YOU WHAT  ACT I  SCENE I  A Room at  Sir GEORGE EUSTON's  Enter  Mr EUSTON  followed by  Sir GEORGE  Sir George  BUT my dear Uncle why in such a passion  Mr EUSTON  I can't help itI am out of all patienceDid not I leave you one of the happiest men in the world  Sir GEORGE  Well and so you find me Sir  Mr EUSTON  'Tis falseyou are not happyyou can't be happy 'tis falseand you shan't be happy  Sir GEORGE  If you are resolved to make me otherwise Sir  Mr EUSTON  No I am not resolved'tis yourself that is resolvedDid not I leave you one of the happiest of menmarried to one of the most beautiful women in the worldDid not I give you my blessing and a large fortune and did I not stay and see you father of a fine boyThen only just stept over to visit my estate in St Kitts and now I'm come back here I find you married to another womanand your first wife still  living  and egad she is married to another man  Sir GEORGE  Dear Uncle I should certainly have asked your opinion and my Uncle Anthony's on the subject but your absence put it out of my power and it was universally believed the ship in which you sailed was lost  Mr EUSTON  Well you'll hear what my brother will say to it  Sir GEORGE  I trust Sir when I have explained every thing you will not only think me worthy of your pardon but even of being pleaded for to my Uncle  Mr EUSTON  Not I indeedNay were it in my power to do you any good I wou'd notI shan't forgive you myselfmuch less ask himBut you are right in fixing on me for a mediator my brother pays much regard to me trulyI have been of infinite service to be sure in reconciling him to his own poor boy Nay did he not even for my brother Anthony would always be master although he was the youngest when I went to him to persuade him to forgive poor Charles  his son did he not even instead of my gaining him over and getting something for the poor boy did he not even draw me into a promise never to do any thing for him myselfMy brother does what he pleases with mebut nobody else shallNo what I want in resolution to him I'll make up in obstinacy to other people  Sir GEORGE  Sir if you will but hear the just pleas I have to offer  Mr EUSTON  I will hear no pleasWhat do you think my brother will say Why you inconsiderate boy He had designed you for his heir  Sir GEORGE  I should be as sorry Sir to excite his displeasure as I am at incurring yours yet give me leave to add I should derive very little enjoyment from the possession of a fortune which his son my poor cousin but for a single act of imprudence had a right to expect And be assured Sir that if this seeming indiscretion of mine when compared with that of his son's shou'd be regarded so unfavorably as to make  his  offence appear lighter to my Uncle and move him to forgivenessI will contentedly support the burthen of his resentment  Mr EUSTON  Why now that's well spokenYou silly young rogue I am not angry with you for getting rid of your wifefor that I dare say is what every sensible man in the world wou'd do if he cou'd I am only angry with you for getting anotherCou'd not you know when you were well off you blockhead  Sir GEORGE  Dear Uncle as you are a bachelor and can only speak of wives from theory suppose we drop the subjectIs my Uncle Anthony come to his house He knows nothing of the alteration that has taken place in my family you tell meShou'd I wait on him or do you think he will favor me with a visit first  Mr EUSTON  Now what a deal of ceremony'Tis a fine thing to  look  like a man of consequence My brother Anthony has had more privilege  from his looks than I ever had from being eldest soneven you whom I love so well and have given half my fortune to and 'tis not long you know that you have expected a six pence from Anthony yet you never meet  him  without a low bow "How do you do SirI hope you are well UncleI am glad to see you"And you stumble over  me  with "So Uncle how is it how is it Uncle"And when you invite us both "Uncle Anthony I hope I shall have the  honor  of your company"While you give me a nod "Uncle I shall see you"  Sir GEORGE  Dear Sir  Mr EUSTON  Nay with every other person 'tis the same thingIf we are stuffed into a coach with a little chattering pert Miss "Oh dear Mr Anthony Euston you must not ride backwards here is room for  you  on this seatand  Mr Euston  I know will like one seat as well as another"ad then am I put with my back to the horses though my head is whirling all the time  like one of the coach wheels Then if any thing be lost or wanted when no servant is by "Mr  Anthony  Euston must not stir for the worldbut  Mr Euston  they know will be so kind as to go for it"And this is all because I am good natured Egad if this is my reward no wonder there are so few in the world of my temper  Sir GEORGE  But dear Sir no jestingDoes my Uncle intend to call on me or not  Mr EUSTON  Yes I dare say he  did  intend it and if he does not hear of what you have been doing before he gets to your house he will  Sir GEORGE  Why then my dear Uncle will you step home and give orders that none of the servants mention any thing to him this morning  Mr EUSTON  There now"  I  step home and give orders" There 'tis againWou'd you ask my brother to "step home and give orders" No I fancy notBut Ipoor Iwill be so good as to do it you thinkBut for once I won'tBesides Anthony never asks questions of servants We enquired of our housekeeper indeed how you did last night she told us both you and your Lady were well and so we thought all safe Anthony will ask no more questions therefore you may have the pleasure of explaining matters to him yourself as you have to me  Sir GEORGE  I shou'd be sorry if any imperfect account shou'd reach him for so sincere is my respect for him I wou'd not even suffer for  a moment in his esteem I will be with him in half an hour but I am afraid  Mr EUSTON  No no he'll not be out nor have had any company in that timefor my brother is no sailor and he'll be too fond of the exchange of a bed for a hammock to be stirring so soon However I think I  will  step home and give a caution to the servants that they don't mention your divorce to himAs for myself I'll keep out of his wayI'll not go near himfor I will say this for my brother although it was never in my power to persuade him to forgive an injury or an indiscretion in my life yet I never said to him "Brother Anthony  don't  forgive a thing" that he did not take my advice  Sir GEORGE  Come Uncle walk into the parlor before you goLet me introduce you to Lady EustonDo step in and take your chocolate with her  Mr EUSTON  And by the time I have taken a turn in the Park and eaten a mouthful of dinner you'll perhaps have a new Lady Euston to introduce me to and I may drink tea with  her  Sir GEORGE  Well Uncle whether you stay or go I must bid you a good morning for I am obliged to attend a friend who has a lawsuit depending and I fear I shall be waited formy presence won't be required long and I'll be with my Uncle Anthony within half an hour  Mr EUSTON  Very well  Going  but you had better take an hourLet me advise you to take an hour Anthony is devilish sharphe is not to be imposed upon Take an hour or an hour and half before you see himAnthony is a deep man he is not to be deceivedfor I dare say in his time he has been as idle as yourselfand I  will  go on your errand  Exeunt Mr Euston and Sir George separately  SCENE II  A Room at  Major CYPRUS's  Lady HARRIET CYPRUS  and  BLOOM  waiting  Lady HARRIET  Married  BLOOM  Yes my Lady as sure as death  Lady HARRIET  Amazing It cannot be  BLOOM  O yes my Lady I have known of it these three months but as they kept out of town till within this fortnight and your Ladyship has been abroad most of that time I thought I would not tell your Ladyship till we returned to London when your Ladyship was sure to hear of it Why they live but just by madam and my master I know has been several times in company where they have been visiting  Lady HARRIET  Ay she was your master's intended  BLOOM  O yes my Lady I know that  Lady HARRIET  Insignificant girlI triumphed when I snatched him from her and now I suppose she thinks to triumph equally  BLOOM  No doubt madamBut if I was you I wou'd let her see I cared nothing about him  Lady HARRIET  And do you imagine I do care No indeed Bloom my exchange is for the better I am certain and  sighing  entirely to my satisfaction  BLOOM  Indeed I think so madam you certainly have changed for the betterand bless me I think of all the husbands I ever saw my present master is sure the fondest  Lady HARRIET  As for thatno one cou'd be fonder than Sir George at first  BLOOM  Ay my Lady but Major Cyprus is not so flighty as Sir George  Lady HARRIET  Not so slighty    sighs    I have been envy'd Sir George's gaiety a thousand times  BLOOM  Yes my Lady when your Ladyship married first I suppose but you know in a few months Sir George altered so much and seemed so miserable I protest every single rap that came at the door made my blood run cold for I took it for the report of a pistol  Lady HARRIET  You need not have feared him Bloomhe is too fond of the pleasures of  this life Dear pleasures which he wanted to retrench me in  BLOOM  More shame for him madamNow my present master is a soldier and what is more I dare say will soon be call'd on to go abroad  Lady HARRIET  Hah  BLOOM  Nay I beg your Ladyship's pardonI thought perhaps your Ladyship wished to see the Major show himself a courageous gentleman in the field and that that was the reason of your presering him to Sir George  Lady HARRIET  I prefer Did not my brother from Sir George's humiliating suspicions and cruel treatment of me compel us to a divorce and then as a defence for my weakness forced me into the arms of the Major being I suppose convinced that nothing less than a soldier should undertake the guard of a Lady's honor  BLOOM  Very true madamand I heard the Major say this morning as your Ladyship left the room that "your Ladyship's honor would reqnire the guard of a file of musketeers"  Lady HARRIET  Ungenerous maneven worse to me than Sir Georgefor poor Sir George from my indiscreet partiality to this ingrate had some pretence for his unkind apprehensions but Mr Cyprus who knows what  proofs of affection I have given him even in preference to the man I had sworn to love  BLOOM  Nay I fancy that is what frightens my master for I believe he is a little fearful lest your Ladyship shou'd chance to be forsworn again  Lady HARRIET  Insolent suppositionHe knows the delicacy of my sentimentsmy honor to Sir Georgeknows that although his unwearied artifices conquered my too susceptible heart and hurried me to indiscretions I merited not that severe contumely I have endured  BLOOM  Bless my soulWell now I assure you you surprize meAnd so my Lady there was nothing at all in it when Sir George found my master in the closet  Lady HARRIET  What did you suppose  BLOOM  Oh my Lady nothingI hope I did not distress your Ladyship by the mention of Sir George's second marriage  Lady HARRIET  Ridiculous  BLOOM  Nay indeed I always thought as your Ladyship wou'd not live with him yourself your Ladyship did not wish to prevent them that wou'd  Lady HARRIET  Don't mention that insignificant woman  BLOOM  If I was your Ladyship I am sure  I wou'd not careespecially as I got married before him  Lady HARRIET  Leave me  BLOOM  Aside    She'll have another husband within half a yearand so have three all alive at onceWell I will say 'tis very hard that because I am poor I never can have above one at a time    Exit Bloom    Lady HARRIET  And so Sir George has been married these three months to another and intirely forgot meTo be so soon forgottenI shall never now forget him I am certain He has behaved like a man of resolution and spirit in casting me from his heart and I feel the irreparable loss Why were we divorced I shou'd have disliked him still had be been my husband and yet how tender how patient to my failings to what Mr Cyprus isHis cruel and unjust suspicions of me are not to be borneHow provokingly did he treat me last nightI was too tamebut the next time he insults me with his jealousy I will endeavor to augment rather than pacify itI'll try a reverse of conductThough indeed I  am  tolerably provoking in all our wranglesyes thank heaven I can say as cool spiteful things as any woman in the world    Exit    SCENE III  Another Apartment in Major Cyprus's House  Enter  COLONEL DOWNRIGHT  followed by the  MAJOR  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I assure you Major this is the first visit I have made since I set my foot in LondonNay and faith no great compliment to you neither for as I parted with my fellow passengers at Portsmouth I don't know that I have a friend or acquaintance in the whole town but yourself  Major CYPRUS  I am happy in your want of friends Colonel if it gives you occasion to consider me as one  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  As for that I don't want friends neither I believe only they are not here at present I have plenty of friends on the other side the AtlanticZounds I think it wou'd be hard for a man who has been so long in the army and borne a post like mine in it not to have a  regiment  of friends at least  Major CYPRUS  Which is a great consolation to you no doubt Colonel  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  The greatest in the world Major But whatyou have changed your house since I was last in Englandthis is not the same I think tho' near the same spot  Major CYPRUS  YesI have changed my houseand what is more changed my state too Colonel  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why you are not married  Major CYPRUS  What surprises you  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Nay I am not surprised at your marrying only at your appearing so easy about it  Major CYPRUS  And why not Colonel A valuable woman  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Very truevery trueand so I wish you joy with all my heart    Shaking hands    But who is the Lady pray Do I know her or any of her family  Major CYPRUS  Did you know Sir George Euston  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I have heard of him  Major CYPRUS  She was his Lady  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  A widow  Major CYPRUS  Noshe was no widow  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Did not you say she was Sir George Euston's wife  Major CYPRUS  Very truebut Sir George is still living  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  What the devil is the man living and you married to his wife  Major CYPRUS  It was a divorce Colonel  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  A divorceWhuNow I understand youWhy that's  mariage en militaire  You might well appear so easy  Major CYPRUS  Fy ColonelI assure you Lady Harriet Cyprus and I are a most happy coupleand my having snatched her from "a dull doating husband" gives superior pleasure and triumph to our bliss  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  The husband is much obliged to you both  Major CYPRUS  Why poor fellow that is the worstIn spite of the congratulations I receive from my friends and my natural desire of fame and propensity to conquest I do feel and cannot help it a most deep sorrow and compassion for the thorns I have planted in his bosom  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  But I suppose he used his Lady very ill before he provoked her to the divorce and certainly prefer'd some other  Major CYPRUS  Oh no by no meansHe doated on her even to the day of their separation notwithstanding it was he who sued for the divorce  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  He  who sued for the divorceOh that was it I understood you that you had planted  thorns  but you said  horns  I suppose  Major CYPRUS  Smiles    Ha ha  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Oh I wish you much joy  Major CYPRUS  Why ironically Colonel Depend upon it I am the envy of all the men in townLady Harriet Cyprus is a perfect beauty  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I am glad she is perfect in some respect  Major CYPRUS  Oh    With some inquietude    ridiculous ColonelDivorces happen now every dayand the favoured lover is the most admired and envy'd of mortals while the poor husband becomes an object of general pity  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Ay the husband  Major CYPRUS  Yes the husband  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Ay and  you  are the husband now  Major CYPRUS  Pshaw the forsaken husband  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  You pity him  Major DOWNRIGHT  Certainly  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And if he is a tender hearted man I suppose he pities you  Major CYPRUS  Ha ha haLet me describe a scene to you where poor Sir George's situation must affect the most obdurate heart Lady Harriet Euston now Lady Harriet Cyprus was when I first became acquainted with her a very loving wife we are friends Colonel and I will venture to recount a few anecdotes to you a very loving wife indeed and but for my insinuationsartful insinuations I may call themhad continued her conjugal regardshe had been  to this hour an example to wives if I had not tempted her to stray  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Ay youor somebody else  Major CYPRUS  Disturbed    Hear me out Colonelshe was long an example to wivesshe was I assure youBut to describe to you Sir George's pitiable situation and what was chiefly the cause of the divorceOne evening we had prolonged the  têteàtête  rather beyond the usual time when unexpectedly Sir George and a party of beaux and belles were rushing up stairs"Dear Major" cried my wife  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Your wifeSir George's you mean  Major CYRPUS  Yes Sir George's  then  but my wife  now  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Ay ay and I most sincerely give you joy    Ironically    Major CYPRUS  Pshaw you put me out"Dear Major" cried my wife or Sir George's if you will have it so"What will become of us" for Sir George had given us some little proofs of his jealousy "what will become of us" exclaimed the then Lady Harriet Euston"Put me into your thimble into the eye of your needle madam" said IInstead of which cramm'd I was into that closet  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  That closet  Major CYPRUS  That very identical closet which you see therefor Sir George never loved the  house after and so settled it on her LadyshipScrewed up in that closet I believe I remained ten minuets when old Lady Downfall who was of the party called for drops the door was opened and out dropt your humble servant  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Zounds it was enough to make you wish yourself  Major CYPRUS  Nay it was Sir George's place to wish Every beau in the room was round me in a moment and in a whisper "Give you joy Major""The happiest man in the world""An Alexander""A conqueror every where"Even old Sir Samson Shrivel shook his head and wished to be in my place  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Zounds I would have thrust him into the closet and kept him there for a month But what did the husband say all this time  Major CYPRUS  That is what I was going to tell youWhat did he say Why he said nothing You may depend upon it he heard and saw all the half stifled laughs and was wise enough to know to whom they were directedso poor fellow he turned palebit his lipslooked at her Ladyshiplooked at melooked at his swordand then cried "Heigh ho"  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Heigh hoAnd what the deuce did you say  MAJOR  What do you think I said Egad I  was  a little confused  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Confused  Major CYPRUS  And do you know I saidFaith it was an odd speech and has been laughed at since in a thousand sashionable circlesthe conclusion of it has been particularly marked Dear Sir George said IHe was standing where you may be here a little more this way and I just where I am at present"Dear Sir George" said I half stifling a laugh for by my soul I could not help it though I pitied the poor devil too Dear Sir George said I "I'll tell you what"you will find  nobody  to blame in this affairI protest my being in that closet was entirely owing to "I'll tell you what"In short to anan  undescribable something  There I made a full stop  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  "An undescribable something"  Major CYPRUS  'Tis true upon my soul those were the very words  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Owing to an "Undescribable something" and "I'll tell you what" that I got into this closet and so I suppose the next day Sir George left both his wife and the closet and you have ever since held possession  Major CYPRUS  After some other explanations and regular proceedings I became the happy husband he was never formed to be  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  But I hope you keep the key of the closet  Major CYPRUS  You will have your joke ColonelSir George out of despair is just married  againand Lady Harriet's affection for me is suchyet faith I must confess to you too Colonel that noth with standing I am so very happy in my marriagemy wife so very beautiful and so affectionateyet I am a sad wicked fellow I have not forgot my old waysno I am going tomorrow evening to meet a Lady of untarnished reputationa married ladyFaith 'tis wrongI know it isbut I cannot withstand the temptationno I cannot forget my old ways    Yawning    Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And do you suppose her Ladyship can forget  her  old ways either    Yawning    Major CYPRUS  For shame Colonelbut you are so fond of a jokeegad I have a great mind to make you laugh most heartily at the business I have now on my handsyou wou'd say it was the most impudent thing of meI'll tell you another time on puporse to make you laugh no other design whatever    A bell rings    That is her Ladyship's bellcome I will introduce you to her directly and I flatter myself you will admire my choice  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  It does ideed excite my admiration most prodigiously    Exeunt    END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Room at  Sir GEORGE EUSTON's  Enter  Mr ANTHONY EUSTON  and a  SERVANT  SERVANT  I'LL let my master know immediately Sir    Exit    Mr ANTHONY  Sir George has changed all his servants I think as well as his house for I have not seen one that I know and not one of

Exit  Lady Euston  SCENE II  A Room at  Major CYPRUS's  Enter  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  and  Sir Harry HARMLESS  Sir HARRY  Now the Major is gone Colonelnotwithstanding all he has been talking of  love and his vast happinessyou will hardly believe it perhapsbut he is not so very happy  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  No  Sir HARRY  No poor manyou will hardly think itbut he is jealous  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  What already And for Heaven sake of whom  Sir HARRY  Nay I assure you he has no causeNor is he jealous of one alonehe is so of every bodyand will be so of youtherefore I tell you that you may be on your guardI am constantly with his Lady and him and because the poor woman once shut him up in her closet he now suspects a lover concealed in every part of the houseand I have known him when the mad fit has been upon him search for a supposed rival even in her drawers and bandboxes  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Pray Sir do you live in the house  Sir HARRY  I have been on a visit here these six weeks  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And during that time  Sir HARRY  I have seen such things Enough to terrify me from marryingfor wives are sometimes so provoking I am sure I cou'd not keep my temperNow here is Lady Harriet Cyprusyou cannot think how provoking she is  she sometimes says such terrible things to her husband that I am sure if she was my wife  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why you wou'd not beat her would you or lock her up  Sir HARRY  Nobut perhaps I might kick her lap dog or do some outrage to her dress  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  You wou'd make an admirable soldier Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  I must own Colonel I shou'd have no objection to a commission where the regimentals were becoming  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Really  Sir HARRY  And indeed Colonel I am positive you wou'd be obliged to  press  commissioned officers if it were

marry I never shall  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why so Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Their wives will do for me  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I am amazed Sir Harry that the Major jealous as you describe him should suffer you to remain in his house  Sir HARRY  I have often been surprised at it myself  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  You have  Sir HARRY  But he never was jealous of  me  Zounds it piques me sometimesThe ladies are fond of me and yet the gentlemen are not jealous of meBut indeed my amours have all been managed so secretly that none of them have ever yet come to light  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  But who has been to blame there Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  I have paid regard to the reputation of the ladies and none to my own I expect an assignation tomorrow eveningand I question whether I shall men ion it to above three or four of my acquaintance notwithstanding the lady is reputed a woman of honor and is besides a married lady  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And would you divulge the appointment sooner on that account  Sir HARRY  Certainly Had I a wish to build a reputation  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Who have we here    Looking out    Sir HARRY  The Major and her Ladyship He has been following her into the Park and is now conducting

closet some time ago  Mr ANTHONY  But pray Sir does not Lady Harriet Euston then live here  Major CYPRUS  That lady is no longer Lady Harriet Euston Sir but Cyprusshe is my wife  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  You have spoiled the whole story by beginning at the wrong end  Mr ANTHONY  You astonish meI beg your pardonI came but last night from the WestIndies where I have been for some time and where not the smailest intelligence from England has ever reached me therefore you will excuse my ignoranceBut I think her Ladyship knowing how great a stranger I was ought to have dealt a little more openly with me  Major CYPRUS  I dare say Sir her Ladyship  Mr ANTHONY  Yes I suppose her Ladyship was unwilling to be the first to acquaint me with the death of Sir George  Major CYPRUS  The death of Sir George Sir  Mr ANTHONY  Yes Sirfor while I give you joy on your marriage give me leave to say that mine is all damped by the loss of himand my grief is doubly poignant because till this moment I was not only unacquainted with Lady Harriet's second marriage but till this moment I did not even know Sir George was dead  Major CYPRUS  Sir George is not dead Sir  Mr ANTHONY  What do you meanDid you not tell me you were married to his wife  Major CYPRUS  Very true Sirbut you know that is no reason nowadays why the Lady's first husband shou'd be dead  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why my brother messmate you are just like meI had forgot that a man in England might marry his neighbour's wife and his neighbour living in the next streetAnd 'tis not the wives of their neighbours only these generous gentlement assail but more especially the wives of their  friends  Mr ANTHONY  Shame on such friendship Shame on such neighbourhoodLet every tender husband and virtuous wife desert it    To the Major    Sir I wish you joy and though I know not who are the parties to be censured in this business I wish her Ladyship joyBut more in particular I wish  myself  joy with the sincerest congratulation that amidst the depravity of the times I have followed a beloved wife to her peaceful grave mournful as the day was without seeing her wrested from my arms by the insinuations of a villain or being myself that villain to force her to seek a refuge from my perjuries in the protection of another  Major CYPRUS  Dear Sir let me assure you that however Lady Harriet's conduct may meet censure from the unfeeling prude the woman of sensibility and taste must applaud her spirit  which could no longer submit to the tyranny of Sir George  Mr ANTHONY  Did her Ladyship then sue for the divorce  Major CYPRUS  NoSir George on some frivolous suspicion was pleased to sue for it  Mr ANTHONY  Is Sir George married again  Major CYPRUS  Yes Sir he is marriedHe has won the ladyand he has won her fortunebut for her affectionthere I believe we must excuse Sir Georgethat is a stake now playing for by many noblemen of fashion  Mr ANTHONY  I suspect Sir George is the dupe of a fashionable gallantryI know his virtuesand am sorry to find a man of merit so betrayed  Major CYPRUS  Dear Sir think on Lady Harriet your relation  Mr ANTHONY  Thank heaven all ties between Lady Harriet and me were dissolved when she was divorced from Sir Georgeand so they should Sir had she been my own daughter and Sir George with the principles I know he possesses an utter stranger to me  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why then I believe my friend you are  not  at a relation's house  Mr ANTHONY  Colonel you will call on me shortlySir Mr Cyprus I think you call yourself I assure you Sir as a particular friend  of my nephew's and of the family in generalI am Sir your most obedient servantyour humble servant Sir    With contempt      Exit Mr Anthony    Major CYPRUS  For heaven's sake who is this man I took him to be Lady Harriet's uncle Explain to me who the brute is  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  He came passenger from the WestIndies in the same ship with me and that was the first of our acquaintanceAs he was no more reserved than I we soon became intimate and I learnt from him that his fortune a pretty good one was designed for a nephew whom I now recollect tho' the deuce take me if I thought of it before to be this very Sir George Eustonand a son an only child by that wife he speaks so tenderly of he disinherits  Major CYPRUS  This is the very savage I heard Lady Harriet say the other day was drown'dWhat has his son been guilty of the criminality of a divorce  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Nohis guilt is in being marriedmarried to some poor girlwithout friends or fortuneThank heaven I have neither child nor wife to offend me but if I had I don't know which I wou'd make the most obedient  Major CYPRUS  And were you never a lover Colonel Never in the service of the ladies  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  O yesI have been in a closet before nowand under a bed toobut then I was never pull'd out by a  husband  and on a discovery I cou'd always describe the something that brought me there  Major CYPRUS  By heaven you are so taken with that joke I cannot reserve that which I before hinted at from you any longerRat me if I have not an appointment for tomorrow evening with Euston's  other  wifeIs it not the most impudent thing of me  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I'll be shot if I don't think so  Major CYPRUS  The poor fellow thinks her as chaste as Diana and so she is at present as far as I knowI was happy in her favor a few years agobut marriage not being then convenient my passion was postponedOn her becoming Euston's wife I renewed my addresses and she has kindly allotted tomorrow evening for our first têteàtête  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Zounds have a care or you will be obliged to marry  her  too  Major CYPRUS  No nowe shall be very circumspect in our conductBut laughWhy the devil don't you laugh  Golonel DOWNRIGHT  No I was thinking  Major CYPRUS  On what  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Come I must be gone or I shall be too late for my business  Major CYPRUS  I'll attend you immediatelyBut what were you thinking on  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I was thinking on the happinessof a married man    Exeunt Colonel Downright and Major Cyprus    END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Room at  Sir GEORGE EUSTON's  Enter  Mr EUSTON  and  Sir GEORGE  Mr Euston  BLESS my soulBless my soul Why what did my brother Anthony sayWas not he in a dreadful passionOnly think of  his  being made such a fool ofIt would not have signified had it been  me  It had been a good joke if the mistake had happened to me then you wou'd have had something to have laughed at  Sir GEORGE  Dear Sir let us think no more about itmy Uncle has listened to reason and approves my conduct in every circumstance  Mr EUSTON  Ay 'tis very well George'tis all very wellbut I know had you been his son he wou'd not have forgiven youhe loved that boy so well he wou'd never forgive him the smallest fault  Sir GEORGE  A very cruel proof of his affection  Mr EUSTON  'Tis true notwithstandingyou know it isPoor CharlesGeorge you must do something for himYou know your Uncle won'tand I am tied from it by a solemn  promise Many a letter and petition came from his wife to my brother and me before we went abroad but all in vain for I had but just then given Anthony my word and wou'd not equivocate by causing the poor boy or his family to be relieved in any shape through my means and therefore I forebore to mention their distress to youHowever now though I have not forgot my promise I will not be so  particular  about itand when the deviation from my word disturbs my conscience I'll hush it to rest with having relieved a destitute family  Sir GEORGE  Say no more SirI understand youand to find out my cousin and his family shall immediately be my care  Mr EUSTON  Shaking hands with Sir George    That's right GeorgePoor Charles is a Lieutenant in the East IndiesHis wife must be the first object of your bountyJust before I left England she wrote me a letter from a village near Yorkwhere he left her with two children and she styles them in her letter "the offspring of want and wretchedness" I was a hard hearted fellow not to listen to her complaintbut I think since I have been at sea I have been more compassionateI never knew before what it was to be cold or hungry  Sir GEORGE  Can you tell me the name of the village Sir where I am to seek her  Mr EUSTON  Write to her at the postoffice SelbyIf she should have left the place they may still know where to send her letters I  wish some friend that had not made a promise would speak to my brother Anthony about them at present perhaps going to sea has changed his heart too  Sir GEORGE  No Sir I touched on that subject when I was with him this morning  Mr EUSTON  Did youDid youAnd what did he say  Sir GEORGE  Asked if I meant to make him forbid me his sightand on my apologising commanded me never to mention my poor cousin in his hearing again  Mr EUSTON  Ay that is what I must never doWell so much the betterfor now George neither you nor I can tell tales one of another  Sir GEORGE  You are right SirHad my Uncle Anthony an estate to bestow on each of his family he could not exact more obedience to his will than he does at present  Mr EUSTON  'Tis very true George But what keeps him so long awayI expected he wou'd have been with your Lady before this time acknowledging her for his niece tho' they have had one meeting it seems  Sir GEORGE  My Uncle cannot be introduced to Lady Euston till tomorrow Sir Lord Layton for whom he settled some business when he was abroad called on him just as I came away and as his Lordship is going to Italy in a  day or two he entreated my Uncle to accompany him immediately to his country house about ten miles from town in order to look over some papers he has there  Mr EUSTON  Here comes your Lady so I'll leave you  Enter  Lady EUSTON  Lady EUSTON  Dear Mr Euston I hope I do not frighten you awaySir George will be offended with me if I do  Mr EUSTON  No madamI am sure no man cou'd be offended at being left in such charming company    Exit Mr Euston    Sir GEORGE  My Uncle is grown a man of gallantry  Lady EUSTON  Yes I inspire all the men  Lady Euston  Yes I insire all the men  Sir GEORGE  I believe you do  Lady EUSTON  Cou'd I only inspire you with reason to listen to my arguments  Sir GEORGE  'Tis in vainThe Major shall now feel my resentmentDid he imagine because I was indifferent to the conduct of an  undesserving  woman that I am not to be roused at such an injury as thisAn attempt on the principles of a woman of virtue'Tis done on purpose to try me and by Heaven he shall findThat wretch too Sir Harry  Lady EUSTON  Oh pray have pity on poor Sir Harry  Sir GEORGE  No madamI only defer my resentment till I have had some conversation with my Uncle Anthony  Lady EUSTON  Do my dear Sir George suffer me to revenge my own cause this onceand ever after  Sir GEORGE  I positively must  Lady EUSTON  Nay Sir George in a year or two I may perhaps have no objection to your sighting a duelbut only three months marriedI do wish to keep you a little longer  Sir GEORGE  Depend upon it Lady Euston death had never half the terrors I have beheld it with since I called you minebut that life you have endeared to me  Lady EUSTON  You wou'd throw away immediately in my serviceNo no Sir George a fond wife will never suffer her husband to revenge her wrongs at so great a risk Besides the exertion of a little  thought  and  fancy  will more powerfully vindicate innocence than that brilliant piece of steel I assure you  Sir GEORGE  Perhaps you are right  Lady EUSTON  Certainly I amNow suppose a gentleman makes love to meI divulge the affront to you you call my insulter to an account  Your  ball misses he fires into the air and to the same of having dared to wound your  honor he gains that of presenting you with your life  Sir GEORGE  But why must these circumstances take place  Lady EUSTON  Well then we will suppose he kills you how do you like that  Sir GEORGE  Smiling    Hem  Lady EUSTON  Or we will suppose you kill himEven how do you like  that  Sir GEORGE  Well I confess that if a severe punishment could be thought of for such insolence  Lady EUSTON  There is as severe a punnishment to men of gallantry as they call themselves as sword or pistol laugh at themthat is a ball which cannot miss and yet kills only their vanity  Sir GEORGE  You are right  Lady EUSTON  Let me seewe have been now only three months married and in that short time I have had no less than five or six men of fashion to turn into ridiculeThe first who ventured to declare his passion was Lord William Bloomlyhis rank joined to his uncommon beauty had insured him success and wherever I went I was certain to hear his distress whispered in my earat every opportunity he fell even upon his knees and as a tender earnest of my pity for him begged with all the eloquence of love for "a single lock of my  hair which he wou'd value more than any other woman's person the wealth of worlds or he is a great patriot you know even the welfare of his country"  Sir GEORGE  I am out of patience  Lady EUSTON  You will be more soFor I promised him this single lock  Sir GEORGE  You did not  Lady EUSTON  But I didand added with a blush that I must insist on a few hairs from one of his eyebrows in returnwhich he absolutely refusedand on my urging it was obliged to confess "he valued that little brown arch more than the lock he had been begging for consequently more than any woman's person the wealth of worlds or even the welfare of his country"I immediately circulated this anecdote and exhibited the gentleman both as a gallant and a patriot and now his Lordship's eyebrow which was once the admiration is become the ridicule of every drawingroom  Sir GEORGE  Your Ladyship then wou'd not menace your lover  Lady EUSTON  Certainly not"You are the most beautiful woman I ever saw" said Lord  Bandy  "and your Lordship is positively the most lovely of mankind""What eyes" cried he "what hair" cried I "what lips" continued he "what teeth" added I "what a hand and arm" said he "and what a  leg  and  foot  " said I"Your Ladyship is jesting" was  his Lordship's last reply and he has never since even paid me one compliment Prudes censure my conductI am too freewhile their favorite Lady Strenuous in another corner of the ballroom cries to  her  admirer"Desist my Lord or my dear Sir Charles shall know that you dare thus to wound my ears with your licentious passionif you ever presume to breath in again I will acquaint him with itdepend upon it I will    Sighs and languishes    Oh you have destroyed my peace of mind for ever"  Sir GEORGE  There are too many such ladies but no such wou'd I hazard my life forthat I have proved  Lady EUSTON  And upon my word Sir George even the virtuous wife who wou'd not have some regard to her husband's  life  as well as his  honour  if I were a gentleman I should not feel myself under many obligations to  Sir GEORGE  You wou'd protect both  Lady EUSTON  And the guilty not escapeNow with your consent what must be the confusion shame and disappointment of my two masked lovers tomorrow eveningthe brutal audacity of one and isignificance of the other both beneath  your  resentment yet deserving objects of mine And indeed Sir George it is my fixed opinion that the man who wou'd endeavour to wrong a virtuous wife shou'd be held too despicable for the resentment of the husband and only worthy the debasement inflicted by our sex I have already sent a letter to Sir Harry  with the appointment at the masquerade and the Major has my promise of a meeting at the same timeCome come Sir George it is the first petition I ever presented do not refuse me  Sir GEORGE  Give me till the morning to consider of it  Lady EUSTON  With all my heartand in the mean time reflect on thisthat in regard to your terrible sex whether as licentious lovers or valiant championswomen of  real honour  are not in danger from the one and therefore like me ought to forego the assistance of the other    Exeunt Lady Euston and Sir George    SCENE II  A Room at  Colonel DOWNRIGHT's  Enter  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  and  Mr ANTHONY EUSTON  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  My good friend I was just going to bedbut I am glad of your company though I did not expect it  Mr ANTHONY  Colonel my errand at this time was merely to ask a favour of you  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Command it and you will make me proud  Mr ANTHONY  Why then Colonel with Lord Layton today at whose house I dined  a circumstance happened on which account I expect his Lordship will call on me tomorrow for a fashionable satisfaction and though depend upon it I wish for no such rash means of ending a dispute yet if his Lordship  shou'd  call upon me 'tis fit I be prepared with a second and I thank you for the friendly assurance you have now given me of your service  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  You are as welcome to itI was going to say as my kingbut zounds if I shou'd be killed in a pitiful quarrel at home I shou'd blush even in my gravefor when I die I hope to have my knell rung by the groans of a score or two of our country's treacherous foes  Mr ANTHONY  The service I shall put you to Colonel will not prevent that hope  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  But what for Heaven's sake has brought you into a quarrel  Mr ANTHONY  The cause of our quarrel wasyou will call it a very trivial one I dare saya woman  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why my old friend you have not been quarrelling about a womanOh if I shou'd be kill'd for a woman I shou'd cut a noble figure indeed  Mr ANTHONY  Hear me Colonel hear meand as you may question my prudence let me tell you the whole adventure  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Nay nay I did not mean to question your prudence nor to speak  against the women either I like them as well as you do  Mr ANTHONY  I own I have a respect for their sex which unites me to them as their father their friend and admirerAnd I beg you will give me your sentiments upon the character of one whose behaviour this day has surprised me beyond measureI will describe it to you and you will then tell me whether you believe me imposed upon or whether you think she really clims that extraordinary attention I have some how been compelled to give her  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Well let me hear  Mr ANTHONY  Lord Layton and I had no sooner plac'd ourselves in his Lordship's coach than he exclaim'd he had just seen the most beautiful girl his eyes ever beheld to whom he had given a look of solicitation and that she was returning her answer by making up to the coachHe begged a thousand pardons but with my permission as he expected no other company at his country house he wou'd take her down to dine with usI knowing his Lordship well and the girl being now arrived at the coach door reluctantly assented and she was immediately handed in  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Zounds he shou'd have taken a companion for you too  Mr ANTHONY  Don't interrupt me  When she had been seated about a minute I cast my eyes upon her  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  'Sdeath I shou'd not have staid half so long  Mr ANTHONY  I was struck with her beauty  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And wished his Lordship out of the way I suppose  Mr ANTHONY  NonoThere was a senfibility in her countenance that amazed meblushes on her cheekstears in her eyesWhen his Lordship spoke to her she answer'd him with a forced smile and a tremor on her voiceShe avoided all conversation and when we alighted I handed her out of the coach  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Ay ay I thought how it was  Mr ANTHONY  You misunderstand meI perceived her hand tremble  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And so I suppose did yours  Mr ANTHONY  If you interrupt me Sir you shall hear no more  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And I believe it will be for your credit if I don't  Mr ANTHONY  Let me tell you all that passed  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  With all my heartif you don't blush at it I shan't  Mr ANTHONY  I believe her to be a woman of virtue  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Then what the devil were my Lord and you  Mr ANTHONY  I have rescued her from him  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why then the deuce take me if you are not more in love than I thought you were  Mr ANTHONY  Oh had you seen her countenance so expressive of anguish The hope with which she lifted up her eyes to me for deliveranceThe horror painted in her face when I left the room Heard her piercing cries that called me back to her protection The despair and earnest supplication that hung upon her tongue while she entreated him to view her not as an object of  love  but  charity  The grief the pathetic tenoerness with which she declared herself "a virtuous though forsaken wifeA poor indigent forlorn mother perishing with her children for whose sake she had been tempted by the first lure that offered prompted by more than common grief to add the sense of guilt to all her other miseries"  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  'Sdeath  Mr ANTHONY  Cou'd I Ought I to have gone and left her  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Left her No But what did you do  Mr ANTHONY  Returned to the chamber and insisted on his Lordship's resigning her to me  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And did he  Mr ANTHONY  She hung upon me and in spite of his menaces I led her to my coach which was then come for me and brought her safe away  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  I hope she got safe home too  Mr ANTHONY  Perfectly soAs her tears interrupted her whenever she attempted to tell me where she lived or explain any circumstance of her life to me I asked no questions but took her to my own housedesired my housekeeper to show her an apartment and treat her with attentionand promising to see and speak with her in the morning left her to the repose which she must greatly want  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  And now you think his Lordship will send  you  to repose for all this  Mr ANTHONY  He may attempt it for which I wish to be prepared  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Well then here is my handand though I must acknowledge that you have had too little of the man of the world about you in the business yet as I said before command me  Mr ANTHONY  Come then Colonel my coach is waiting for me at the door will you go with me to the next coffeehouseI have to  meet a gentleman there on a little business and afterwards we will enjoy half an hour's

parents the heir to large possessions and I to none when he married all were given up and he changed his state for mineWe had no friend but in each otheryet happy was that state to  me  till poverty surprised us and the fond hope which once he cherished of paternal forgiveness vanished from my husbandThen all our days were bitter as they had before been happytears were my only food and sighs were hiseven  reproach  I have endured from him for making him the friendless wretch he call'd himslefYetyet at our parting oh then he cancell'd allfor when the regiment in which he served was ordered from the kingdom he hung upon me clasped his poor children begg'd our forgiveness for the thousand outrages distress at our misfortunes had caused him to commitswore that affection for us was the source of his impatienceprayed heaven to bless  us  whatever might be his fatenay prayed that death might speedily be his doom so that it turned his father's heart to us  Mr ANTHONY  And have you never apply'd to his father  LADY  Yes but all in vain and two months since hearing my husband was made prisoner and destitute of every relief and every hope while he remained so I left my children and came to London resolved in  person  to supplicate his father's bounty when I learnt dire news his father visiting an estate abroad was lost and we left to despair  Mr ANTHONY  What do you say  LADY  Nay do not blame himI pardon him from my soulAnd as my husband spite of his disobedience loved him tenderly I will ever give a tear in tribute to his memory  Mr ANTHONY  Without hesitationwithout the

poor stranger who never asked and might not have deserved my bounty while as a daughter begging for an alms I shut my heart and sent your supplications backWhere was the merit of my thousands given while one poor wretch from proud resentment petitioned me in vain  Mrs EUSTON  I dare not call myself your daughter  Mr ANTHONY  You  are  my daughterand when I have supplicated heaven to pardon my neglect of you I'll ask your pardon tooYou  are  my daughterand let the infamy you have escaped serve only to make you more  amiablemake you compassionatecompassionate to your own weak sex in

you the truth I think this business between you and his Lordship might be amicably and honorably settledHowever if you don't fight with  him  you must fight with a mad headed fellow I have left belowso which do you choose  Mr ANTHONY  What do you mean  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Nay you will have a worse chance than you wou'd have had with his Lordship for this man is a soldier one who has been fighting for these four or five years pastbesides he's desperatehalf mad and has sworn he'll either kill or be kill'd by you  instantly  Mr ANTHONY  Let him comeWho and what is heWhat has he to demand of me    Angrily    Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Nay don't be too violent neitherHe's a poor unfortunate lad I fancyand notwithstanding all his blusteringhenow and then looks so heartwounded I can't help pitying him  Mr ANTHONY  But what's his business What is his quarrel with me  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Lord Layton is the innocent cause of ithe told the young man who came to his Lordship's somewhat sooner than I did in search of the Lady whom you took away that the Lady had confessed herself poorand even perishing for subsistenceand that consequently she was willing to resign herself to the most liberalwhich you proving in spite of his Lordship's generosity you carried off the prizeand egad I owned it was what I had suspected notwithstanding your grave countenance last night  Mr ANTHONY  You told him you thought so  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Yesfor I wished to turn the whole matter into a joke with his LordshipI did not think at the time that the young fellow wou'd have been so violentfor till this was explained he was as patient as a lamb and only inquired with  trembling  and  sighs  for the Ladybut when he heard what I said egad he laid hold of me and swore till I brought him to my friend the "unpitying vile purchaser of innocence" meaning you he wou'd not quit meSo here he has followed me through the streetsand on condition that he wou'd be patient while I came and announced him to you I have promised him you shall give him satisfaction  Mr ANTHONY  What is this gentleman's name    Anxiously    Colonel DOWNRIGHT  He did not tell us  Mr ANTHONY  Does he know mine  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  No I thought it most prudent not to tell him for he's such a madman he might have bawled it as we came in the streets  Mr ANTHONY  Much embarrassed    What is he to the LadyHer brotherher cousin  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why faith I've a notion though he did not say so I have a notion he is her husband  Mr ANTHONY  Indeed    Starting    Colonel DOWNRIGHT  Why you don't like the business the

Colonel DOWNRIGHT  What Do  you  weepNow that affects me more than any thing that has been said or done yetI don't like to see a woman cry but I can't bear to see a mana man's tears flow from so deep a sourcethey always appear to have come a long journey and therefore I notice them as strangers that have gone through fatigue and trouble on their wayWhile a woman's tears I consider as mere neighbours that can call upon you when they like and generally drop in on all occasions    Exeunt    SCENE III  MAJOR CYPRUS's  Enter  LADY HARRIET  and  BLOOM  Lady HARRIET  Aloud rap    That is Sir

I am assured of his safety  Major CYPRUS  And pray Sir  who  in this house is to assure you of it  Sir GEORGE  Bursting from the closet    Himself  Major CYPRUS  Confusion  Mr ANTHONY  You see Sir my intelligence was good  Sir GEORGE  Strange as my concealment may appear the cause was such as I can with honour reveal  Major CYPRUS  Then pray Sir with "honour reveal it"  Sir GEORGE  Why then I

Where is Sir George  Mr EUSTON  Here my dearjust stept out of the closet  Lady EUSTON  What closet  Colonel DOWNRIGHT  That  that very  identical  closet  Major CYPRUS  Heigh ho  Mr EUSTON  Indeed Lady Euston you have cause to reproach him  Lady EUSTON  I fear he will rather reproach me for this abrupt intrusionbut my apprehensions for his safety hearing no tidings from his uncle's have alone impell'd me to it  Lady HABRIET  Had your Ladyship not written this letter to the amiable Sir Harry Harmless which I unfortunately supposed intended for Major Cyprus your Ladyship's alarming "apprehensions" might have been spared as I sent for Sir George but to shew him this letter  Mr EUSTON  And that letter was only a jokea scheme to mortify the Major and Sir Harry  Lady EUSTON  It was soI own itAnd the confusion the scheme has occasioned Sir George needs all your forgiveness  Sir GEORGE  I sincerely pardon itand hope the whole company will do me the justice to believe that my sole motive for entering this house was a compliance with what I then thought the dying request of that LadyAnd I now believe that her Ladyship's sole motive for wishing to see me was merely to shew me the etter of which she speaksa copy of which not without my knowledge but against my opinion was written by Lady euston to Major Cyprus appointing a fictitious interview in return for his having dared to offend her with the profession of a licentious passion  Major CYPRUS  Sir George I am perfectly satisfied with this explantationBut after what has happened the world may despise me for being so and therefore Lady Harriet from this moment we separateAnd we had been wifer as well as happier if we had never met  Lady HARRIET  Most willingly separateYour unkind treatmentand my own constant inquietudehave long since taught a woman of the world too feelingly to acknowledge "No lasting friendship is form'd on vice"  Mr ANTHONY  Preach this my dear Lady to all your fair countrywomenenforce your words by your future conduct and they shall draw a veil over the frailty of your past life  Lady HARRIET  Oh MrAnthony cou'd I but retrieve my innocence my honour for ever lost  Mr ANTHONY  Yet do not despairYou can still possess  one  inestimable goodthat inborn  virtue which  never perishes  which never leaves us but to returnFor when you think it extinguished feel but due remorse and it rises again in the soul  Mr EUSTON  That's right brother Anthonycomfort herit is your dutyAnd we are all  relations  you knowthe whole company are related to one anotherThough it is in an odd kind of a jumbled wayI wish some learned gentleman of the law would tell us  what  relations we all areand what relation the child of a first husband is to his mother's second husband while his own father is living  Mr ANTHONY  Brother you think too deeply  Mr EUSTON  Not at all brother AnthonyAnd for fear the gentlemen of the long robe shou'd not be able to find out the present company's  affinity  let us apply to the  kindred ties  of each others passions weaknesses and imperfections and thereupon agree to part this evening not only  near relations  but  good friends  THE END
