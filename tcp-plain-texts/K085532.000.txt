 EPISTLES PHILOSOPHICAL AND MORAL  LONDON Printed for T WILCOX opposite the  NewChurch  in the  Strand  MDCCLIX  To The First  Minister  of  STATE  for the  Time  being  HAIL mighty  Pam  if song without offence  Thus hail the first court card in eminence  Thou in whom kings find oft the sov'reign sway  For kings at  loo  the leading knave obey  Or if content to play an humbler game  Plain  Jack  we stile thee more familiar name  Thou whose sly blows the  lower  party feels  While bent the  high  to catch thy tripping  heels  Great in thyself whatever thou art call'd  Nations by thee enfranchis'd or inthrall'd  Holla'd to day to  Palaceyard  along  Flatter'd at once in metzotint and song  Or piqu'd perhaps while chimes the present line  Ere yet  turn'd out  as usual to  resign  Branded by th' honest satire of the times  With all a minister's mysterious crimes  To thee I pay my court till in disgrace  And then as humbly to the next in place  For know what private worth soe'er thy boast  I not address thy person but thy post  Is there a time when statesmen good or great  Look down with pity on the toils of state  Superiour to the boast of boasted things  The pomp of titles and the smile of kings  When in the private hour of social ease  Ambition sleeps and truth itself may please  At such an hour when ev'n politeness deigns  To taste the rudeness of familiar strains  Presuming thou in honour to the muse  Indulgent once her labours may peruse  To thee those honest labours she commends  At court while honest doubtless finding friends  But through thy levee if forbid to press  In freedom's plain and anticourtier's dress  Light of her rhimes as of petitions made  Should they be lost forgotten or mislaid  If not so vain to think thou shouldst commend  In either case permit me to defend  Too well I know imputed as a crime  The gift of reason to the man of rhime  To childish  Fiction  gingling numbers tied  As bells that dangle by its infant side  To useless whims poetick worth confin'd  To strike the sense but not improve the mind  Should on the daring verse then censure fall  From priest or prelate waken'd in the stall  Or should the learned jurors take in hand  To burn the books they may not understand  Scorn'd the loud torrent of the mob's abuse  With thee I leave my errour and excuse  Know then my patron once upon a time  While yet a boy I caught the itch of rhime  But born with hatred to the singsong train  Whose numbers charm like empty notes in vain  While strange to themes t' employ the muse about  The peccant humour broke but little out  Till late in waking dreams that trouble youth  On one side  prudence  urg'd on t'other  truth  Prudence  a worldlyminded dame and sly  Who fix'd on earth still kept her cautious eye  While  truth  whose open breast did mine inflame  Look'd up to Heav'n to heav'n from whence she came  When now my eager heart her pow'r confess'd  And thus her willing captive  truth  address'd  "Art thou my friend that enterprizing youth  "Who make pretensions to the song of truth  "By reason taught to leave in early life  "The wanton mistress for the faithful wife  "Among the sciences thy subject chuse  "Philosophy's  the sister of the  muse  Prudence  who heard made various hems and haws  And after due deliberating pause  Shaking her head "beware rash youth" she cried  "Let prudence here your early footsteps guide  "Art thou so ignorant as not to know  "Truth leads us oft to poverty and woe  "Let me advisewouldst thou succeed in rhime  "Mark at the proper season well thy time  "Taking this maxim as a gen'ral rule  "The knave is honest till he plays the fool  "For times there are of such malignant face  "That sharpers only rise to pow'r and place  "Times when the mere huzza for publick good  "Breaks down all ranks of honour and of blood  "When sacred characters like bawds are us'd  "And princes with impunity abus'd  "The throne of majesty a vulgar thing  "While  George  the cobler damns great GEORGE the king  "In times like these behold on ev'ry side  "What pains we take offensive truth to hide  "Asham'd to show her bashful face at court  "See her simplicity the mob's rude sport  "Her lovers stigmatiz'd by gen'ral hate  "As bold disturbers of the church and state  "Wouldst thou to this abandon'd tribe belong  "What bard e'er heeded yet the TRUTH of  song  "Again 'tis certain there may come a time  "When impudence finds no excuse in rhime  "When even prudence may herself be just  "Her int'rest more to keep than break her trust  "When crowns are honour'd and in proper season  "  Shbbre  dread patriot may be hang'd for treason  "A time perhaps years work the strangest things  "When the brave  Scots  may love their best of kings  "When slighted science may approach the throne  "And  Britons  make true policy their own  "What tho' their  patriot  hearts are known to fail  "When dearth of barley threatens want of  ale  "What tho'  religion  arm'd by commonsense  "Breaks but its weapons in its own defence  "Ev'n yet may  piety  be kept alive  "And half expiring  patriotism  revive  "At such a season should the muse inspire  "If touch'd with caution mayst thou strike the lyre  "Perhaps uncensur'd but to look for praise  "Know these young bard are no poetick days  "But should the  age  as probably it may  "Turn its loose politicks another way  "While in religious mood far push'd the schemes  "Of true born  Britons  always in extremes  "The times may yet return when frantick  zeal  "Shall give its wooden sword an edge of steel  "When  convocations  shall in judgment sit  "To canvass th' infidelity of  wit  "On wicked KNOWLEDGE  Britain  's guilt to lay  "And drive the destin'd victim far away  "O thus if  ignorance  should rule in turn  "Bards  lose their ears and martyr  theists  burn  "Ready reforming constables at hand  "Of  scientifick  vice to cleanse the land  "Have thou with truth nor morals aught to do  "Things are not always  fit  that may be  true"  Here  Prudence  endedher advice was good  But  Truth  had charms that could not be with stood  Hers then the musehow far success will show  In times like ours her song be  Ã  propos  So much indeed of  prudence  did I learn  My fingers ne'er in politicks to burn  Silent I sat amidst the party rout  When late the ministry turn'd in and out  When rag'd the furious goosequills of the times  To shame their country with their shameless rhimes  Careless what turtleeating son of  White  's  Might set the blunders of the state to rights  If  Pollio Gallus Tully  or  his grace  Should all keep out or who get into place  I car'd not I tho' these or none of these  The king the house or mightier  mob  might please  Blam'd I the peer whom adverse winds had blown  Round the wide world to prop a monarch's throne  Taught in the hurricanes of southern seas  The statesman's wisdom and the courtier's ease  By plunder'd  Spaniards  the consummate skill  To steer a kingdom like a bark at will  Tho' made too plain the leeway of the realm  Did I presume to bid him mind the helm  Nay when the guardian  genii  of the land  To save our desp'rate fortunes took in hand  I sung them not tho' crown'd by half the nation  With civick wreaths from town and corporation  I ne'er officious crack'd my brains t'amend  Errours the  great  alone might comprehend  Plagu'd with no songs of praise our Lord the King  Nor gave one faggot to the blaze of  Byng  But free from panegyrick as abuse  Put all my little wit to private use  Thus far of  temp'ral  politicks I'm clear  Nor has the  spiritual  had more to fear  Since gospel  witnesses  in form were tried  Their valid evidence I ne'er denied  Ne'er intermeddled with the jury's quest  Nor contradicted  Littleton  or  West  When  church  and  state  learn'd  Warburton  would join  Tho' sad th'affair I made it none of mine  Nor did I e'er 'gainst  Leland  's pen presume  To vindicate  Lord Bolingbroke  or  Hume  Made no pretence to freedom of debate  Nor risk'd like harmless nt  Woolston  's fate  And tho' for once in this a trick of youth  Prudential views are sacrific'd to truth  Could I shake off those vices  rhime  and  sense  This  first  might likely prove my  last  offence  Or in thy cause enlisted once my pen  I never more might trouble  truth  agen  But to thy purpose turn my ready hand  True to the  law  and  gospel  of the land  ADVERTISEMENT  THE ground work of the following Epistles being the fruit of a private correspondence it was found necessary in preparing them for the press to adapt them to more general use and amusement It may not therefore be improper to observe that whatever theological subjects have fallen in the author's way he hath purposely avoided taking part with divines of any sect or party leaving it to the ingenuous of every persuasion to determine how far their particular sentiments may be supported by authorities superior to commonsense and simple demonstration As to his poetry having no reputation to lose he is little anxious about what he may acquire Indeed it must be confess'd that perspicuity and argument have been frequently consulted at the expence both of the dignity and harmony of his numbers Elegance however would have been more attended  to had the author's leisure permitted or had his design been to distinguish himself as a  poet  a character he is much less ambitious of than that of a  philosopher    Unmov'd by sophistry unaw'd by name  No dupe to doctrines and no fool to fame  CONTENTS  EPISTLE THE FIRST  Page    OF  truth  in general  Its criterion  Its relation to  opinion  The uncertainty of the latter  Necessary that both should concur in Science  EPISTLE THE SECOND  page    On Science as our guide to truth  The criterion best adapted to the opinion of individuals  The absurdity of persecution  Our pretensions to divine and the bounds of human knowledge  EPISTLE THE THIRD  page    On the infatuation of mankind respecting paradox and mysteries  The effects and causes of such infatuation  The absurdity of supposing ignorance and folly the means to promote the cause of truth or that the freedom of scientifick inquiry is incompatible with the political welfare of society  EPISTLE THE FOURTH  Page    On the weakness of the human understanding  The abstract existence of the Deity  The incomprehensibility of the divine nature and the incongruity of pretended atheism  EPISTLE THE FIFTH  page    On happiness  The apparent incapacity of mankind for its enjoyment  The comparative pain and pleasure of human sensations and their relation to our physical and moral constitution  EPISTLE THE SIXTH  page    On abstract good and evil  The physical perfection of the material universe and the moral harmony observable in the dispensations of Providence  EPISTLE THE SEVENTH  page    On moral principles  The respective influence of  reason  and the  passions  The immorality of  ignorance  and the indispensable duty of seeking  knowledge  EPISTLE THE EIGHTH  page    On the immortality of the soul and the arments for and against a future state  EPISTLE THE  FIRST  ARGUMENT  Of  truth  in general Its criterion Its relation to  opinion  The uncertainty of the latter Necessary that both should concur in Science  SUMMARY  UNiversal belief being in fact an undisputed criterion of truth and all mankind necessarily believing those positions which they conceive demonstrable science or demonstrative knowledge is supposed to be the least exceptionable test of what is true or false in general The abstract certitude of the schools is therefore exploded But as particular opinions are not always the effect of knowledge nor are systems constantly founded on scientifick principles it is inquired if there be no other criterion sufficiently obvious to relieve the doubts and reconcile the opposite sentiments of mankind The dispensations of providence as well as the dictates of revelation appear inadequate to the purpose theologists being found too unsucceessful in clearing up the sacred page and phisiologists too ignorant of the system of nature for either to form opinions equally adapted to the credulity of individuals Divines and philosophers are censured indeed rather as mercenary wranglers or bigots to particular systems than fair inquirers after or teachers of the truth A fair and ingenuous inquirer characteriz'd Such not frequently to be found few being capacitated for so arduous a task Fortitude and moderation the grand requisites the scarcity of which in the minds of men in general serves to account for their want of success in the attempt as well as for their promptitude either to embrace  skepticism as an antidote to errour or conformity to avoid the trouble of thinking Dogmatists and Skepticks censured The former on account of their absurd dependance on tradition and futile authorities the latter for superciliously rejecting on the other hand all authority and tradition without distinction In our inquiries after truth however our belief is to be suspended in regard to points beyond our knowledge In scientifick researches also the subtilty of metaphysical arguments should be with caution trusted as insensibly leading us into errour and perplexity  EPISTLE THE  FIRST  WHILE zeal beyond the grave pursues  Whom priest and patriot abuse  With some the fostersire of lies  Extoll'd by others to the skies  St  John  The late Lord Viscount  Bolingbroke  thus sav'd and damn'd by fame  An honour'd and a blasted name  Lorenzo  asks ingenuous youth  What is and who believes the truth  The truth my friend wouldst learn of me  'Tis that wherein mankind agree  At least no safer truth we know  Than that the world will grant us so  "But when and where" the sages tell  Of yore 'twas buried in a well  A trite saying of  Democritus  So deep that hid for want of light  From ev'ry peeping mortal's sight  The more suspicious than the rest  Conceiv'd the story was a jest  And as no soul could find it out  That truth itself was all a doubt  Philosophizing train of thought  Since by improving moderns caught  Who tell us nature trick'd mankind  When giving eyes she left us blind  Heav'n making fools and thinking fit  We know not says  Descartes  whether God hath not created us in such a manner that we are constantly deceiv'd even as to things the most palpable and evident  To play upon their want of wit  But sure we boldly may receive  As truth what all mankind believe  Such universal faith a guide  In skepticism itself implied  "Yet say in what the world unite  "Else useless this our rule of right  "Else still inquiry's at a pause  "Still vague investigation's laws"  Lorenzo  all with you and me  In points demonstrable agree  Conviction right or wrong the test  As the suppos'd demonstration may be either false or true it being sufficient to our argument that all mankind agree to call that  truth  which but appears to be demonstrated  Of truth in ev'ry human breast  While truths demonstratively so  Who once believe profess to  know  On  Science  hence our search must rest  That universal rule confess'd  Laid then those subtilties aside  Where human certitude's denied  Inquiry safely may proceed  To form its scientifick creed  Doth  Solomon  himself profess  His science all uncertain guess  Forc'd by reflective reason I confess That human science is uncertain guess PRIOR's  Solomon  Th'egregious sophister affirms  A contradiction ev'n in terms  Who can his ignorance suppose  Of that he's conscious that he knows  Or according to  Monsieur Huet  if we do not allow  that  to be evident which actually appears so truth and falsehood are equally demonstrable and we may add knowledge and ignorance synonymous terms  Sayst thou slow knowledge faith outflies  Believers spurning at the wise  Opinion wing'd feet hand and head  In haste without her errand sped  Or driv'n inactive here and there  With ev'ry vagrant breath of air  Wouldst therefore know what systems err  To whom opinions to refer  Where trembling doubt and errour blind  At once a guard and guide may find  At once successfully apply  And give to falshood's face the lie  No sect alas profess the rule  That reconciles the knave and fool  Unites the ignorant and wise  Revering these what those despise  Whether from nature's general law  The outlines of our creed we draw  Or think the truth be only given  In revelation pure from Heaven  It matters not unless we find  Some active index in the mind  Some ray of Heaven's unerring light  To point or here or there aright  Let  Christianity  display  Its wond'rous volume to the day  The sacred lines however true  Alike affect not me and you  Th' accepted sense of holy writ  Still resting on th' accepting wit  For who that read but comprehend  As taught by father priest or friend  Or tenets new more nice than wise  Peculiar to themselves devise  How then prevails the sacred text  If by the comment thus perplex'd  If hereticks of ev'ry kind  Their tenets in the gospel find  If thus the spirit hide the flaw  That mars the letter of the law  Let  Nature  's striking scenes engage  The letter'd and unletter'd age  Various as ev'ry varied tribe  The notions hence the world imbibe  When meteors glow and comets blaze  How wond'ring ignorance doth gaze  Foretelling ev'n in errour wise  The judgments gath'ring in the skies  Th'  aurora  Borealis  streaming from the pole  What groundless fear sthe weak control  Hear them address their angry God  And take his mercies for his rod  Whilst thine or  Bradley's  curious eyes  As calmly view the threat'ning skies  The plagues the famines wars they yield  As  Colin  drives his team afield  Rolls the big thunder o'er the plain  Melt the fierce light'nings clouds to rain  Ah me how impious  Crito  cries  To lift thy hand against the skies  Thy lines of magick steel to form  To brave the fury of the storm  With  Franklin  B Franklin  Esq  of  Philadelphia  madly to defy  The thunderer's red rightarm on high  Bold  Titan  to erect thy stand  To wrest the light'nings from his hand  Alluding to the manner of preventing the damage apprehended from thunderclouds discover'd by our late improvements in electricity  Yet those in physicks better read  At honest  Crito  shake the head  In pity or derision smile  Nature and truth their guard the while  Thus by unlike experience taught  Peculiar are our modes of thought  Explain'd by Custom's partial nod  The voice of nature and of God  Dost thou apply to saint or sage  The guides of each believing age  The truths which mysteries conceal  Or those of science to reveal  From far and near what tales absurd  Adulterate the written word  How oft the pure and perfect text  Have base Theologists perplex'd  What transcripts what interpolation  Eternal source of disputation  Alas  Lorenzo  few believe  In fact the doctrines they receive  How few of ev'n the reverend tribe  The very canons they subscribe  Do such their motherchurch defend  On her pluralities depend  The mitre and the sinecure  Preserving best her tenets pure  For rob the priesthood of its gain  What pillar will the church sustain  What cement binds the crazy wall  Whose sapt foundation threats its fall  Do  such  profess to turn the key  On myst'ries hid from you and me  Or of the oracles of old  The dubious phrases to unfold  To teach the truth to vulgar minds  Which Heav'n's own blaze of rhetorick blinds  Ah think not these will e'er display  Their secrets to the eye of day  Tell me what artist will impart  To thee th' arcanum of his art  Not onebut all reserv'd and sly  Affect to cheat th' observer's eye  Their slightest knacks important made  To raise the wonder of their trade  Thus oft the reverend tiro taught  That none may serve their God for naught  Casts o'er his ignorance a veil  Or masks the moral of his tale  Securely laughing in his sleeve  When fools the tale itself believe  To save his calling from abuse  His caution here in fact of use  For once his art and mist'ry  Mistery  not  Mystery  See  Johnson  's Dict fol edit  known  Who churchauthority would own  As when sublime conundrums hit  We laugh to scorn the quibbler's wit  So in rever'd enigmas wise  His riddling reverence we despise  Sayst thou since reformation's hand  From spiritual slav'ry freed the land  The sacerdotal hydra chain'd  By truth opinions are restrain'd  Look round believing friend and see  How pious Protestants agree  In what less fickle do we find  The daughter's than the mother's mind  For know th' abandon'd scarlet whore  The church of  Rome  of which all the reform'd churches may be call'd the descendants at least so far as they usurp an ecclesiastical authority and require implicit obedience in which light only such presumption being destructive of their institution as seminaries of truth and religion they are censur'd in the text  Our present almamater bore  Whose beauty modesty and truth  Were all debauch'd in early youth  While in seraglio close confin'd  Sly priests conceal'd her from mankind  And tho' when zeal to hide her sin  Had almost stript her to the skin  To skreen her batter'd charms from shame  She laid to truth her artful claim  Yet once secure the cunning jade  Gave up its temporary aid  Playing again her mother's game  With priests of ev'ry church the same  As the word priest is not frequently us'd in common discourse to signifie a Protestant divine so neither hath it here such an indiscriminate implication meaning such only as lay claim to that title by their maintaining the tenets of churchauthority and their endeavours rather to keep the world in ignorance than to diffuse the knowledge of the truth  For tho' in pure excess of grace  Miss perk'd it in her mother's face  Her disobedience felt the smart  When stabb'd her int'rest to the heart  What tho' she flaunt no longer gay  Her tawdry trappings cast away  Her trim simplicity at best  Is vanity but sprucely dress'd  What tho' forbid to patch and paint  And pass the sinner for a saint  Yet still the holy dame afraid  That truth and reason spoil her trade  Her pulpittrumpet sounds to arms  And fills the zealot with alarms  Awaken'd by her fearful cries  Behold her doughty champions rise  Arm'd capapiÃ¨ each mother's son  To save their parent roaring run  Conscious how greatly to their cost  Might churchauthority be lost  While thus the orthodox in grain  In spite of fate their church maintain  The truth a term of meaning wide  To all the priest affirms applied  No less the het'rodox than they  From pride or av'rice go astray  As motives similar prevail  With those who brew or broach the tale  Say else if selfconviction true  The conscientious  Henley  knew  Fir'd by a pure religious zeal  That champion of the publick weal  For pence the primacy to slight  If I would have chang'd my principles for interest I might have been Archbishop of  Canterbury  before now HENLEY  vivÃ¢ vocÃª  To jest with ev'ry sacred rite  To trample with avow'd design  On laws both human and divine  Say what his aim whose dread rebukes  Craz'd his poor neighbours of  St Luke's  St Luke  's hospital for lunaticks in  MoorFields  near the Tabernacle and Foundery  Who godly warfare proud to seek  In suff'rance turns the smitten cheek  As knavish Jews to sell their ware  Abuse and insult tamely bear  No worldly gain to  Whitfield  yields  The plenteous harvest of  MoorFields  While from the gift of sterling gold  Like off'rings to the Lord of old  See  Exod  ch  The coatless priest with Aaron vies  Alluding to their admitting coblers porters and beggars as well as regular divines to the ministry  And modern  tabernacles  rise  Or are fanatick weavers led  Because his vanity is fed  A tickling transport that he feels  To find his thousands at his heels  To hear the  Io poeans  ring  Due to the hero saint or king  Which ne'ertheless the mob bestow  On sainted pickpockets below  If then by poverty or pride  The priest and parson led aside  While these th' instructors of mankind  Our ignorance their interest find  O shun  Lorenzo  shun the street  Where disputant theologues meet  See the wing'd cork from side to side  Rebound the truant schoolboy's pride  With equal warmth with equal noise  So these by turns like truant boys  Between what saint or father saith  Bang the light shittlecock of faith  But hark what jargon strikes our ear  What hebrew madmen have we here  What pen the frenzy shall describe  Of  Hutchinson  's or  Behmen  's tribe  Two of the most incomprehensible writers that ever reflected scandal on the science of divinity  Who scorning reason's vain pretence  Make war a dire croisade on sense  If reason then reprizals make  At once their cause and them forsake  What wonder yet in truth 'twere well  Might  Bedlam  spare one vacant cell  Since no good christian yet for  Law  The Reverend Mr  William Law  a writer little inferiour to  Bebmen  himself  Hath strown his darken'd room with straw  Theologists so prone to err  Dost thou philosophers prefer  These oft an interested sect  Like poverty or pride affect  Logicians  casuists by trade  At random draw their furious blade  Taking in gladiatorial pride  The cudgels up on either side  To them indiff'rent wrong or right  Swiss  champions theirs the task to fight  And share with venal art the prey  The golden gettings of the day  So  Broughton  's  A famous boxer  heroes  bruis'd  and bled  At once for honour and for bread  And  Powel  's  An eminent toadeater  virtuous thirst of fame  Inur'd his iron lips to flame  The  learn'd  prodigious wise indeed  The man by Heav'n inspir'd to  read  Affecting merely to decide  Indulge their magisterial pride  And deigning scarce on sense a look  Profoundly dogmatize by book  Save here those champions of the gown  Meek  A fine genius and polite critick  Warburton  and modest  Brown  A most exemplary divine and patriot  To real merit ne'er allied  The  pedant's  or the  parson's  pride  By singularity of taste  Good sense and lit'rature disgrac'd  See wrangling  Sophisters  intent  On crossgrain'd paradoxes bent  As if to truth they made pretence  By wand'ring but from commonsense  Among the witty and the wise  Hence oft in words their difference lies  While empty terms for years engage  The scholar's and the skeptick's rage  Till wearied out they stare to see  In fact how nearly all agree  So poiz'd between two empty scales  Now here now there the beam prevails  That as their false vibrations cease  In equilibrio rests in peace  Nor seldom when in fact dissent  These slashing sons of argument  The  subjectmatter  in debate  Beneath the pains t'investigate  Philosophy at  Arthur  's  An academy well known to students in the politer sciences of  pitting betting  and  whist  taught  So  Bond  and  Brag  disputing fought  Whether as near from  Change  to  Kew  Brundisium minuci melius via ducat an Appi  HOR  To cross the old bridge or the new  "Could neither wheel nor chain decide"  Alas my friend they never tried  For neither of these learned youth  Car'd one brass farthing for the truth  But each to make his judgment out  Would drive fullspeed ten miles about  The  firstphilosophy  A term in vogue given by way of eminence to the philosophy of the present age  in use  Thus argumentative abuse  While truth and falsehood right and wrong  Serve as the burthen of a song  With sophists as with scolding wives  Quarrel the business of their lives  Leave then  Lorenzo  vain dispute  Empty the triumph to confute  Nor those for truth's defenders take  Who cavil but for cavil's sake  But is there layman or divine  In whom good sense and temper join  A priest of honest  The late Bishop of  Clogher  an honour to his profession as well as to the age and country in which he liv'd  Clogher  's mould  Or theist moderate as bold  To whom indulgent Heav'n assign'd  A truly ethick turn of mind  Who dares the mob in scorn to hold  Hath weigh'd the happiness of gold  Hath found the pond'rous cheat so light  That avarice gets nothing by't  Who rates the value of a name  From th' insignificance of same  Not vainly seeking more to know  Than God has giv'n to man below  Yet wheresoe'er display'd her charms  Embracing truth with open arms  On such  Lorenzo  may depend  For guide philosopher and friend  "But where such friend and guide" you cry  Knowst thou no such alas nor I  For O the truth in fact how few  Have pow'r or talents to pursue  Alike th' abilities unfit  Of pedant dull or sprightly wit  Of captious criticks scholiasts vain  Of ev'ry superficial brain  Indeed too oft ev'n genius gains  Its labour only for its pains  Immortal bards not seldom here  Dupes from their mother's milk to fear  Tho' smoothly run the hackney'd lay  Along the beaten moral way  Should truth on custom turn its back  Or deviate from the vulgar track  Like crabs with retrogressive feet  Such temporizing bards retreat  Humming their credit to maintain  To wornout tunes th' old catch again  Ev'n thus thy fav'rite bard retir'd  Whom ev'ry muse at once inspir'd  Whose strains immortalize the guide  His scholiast piously decried  Thy  Pope  who like a forward child  In leadingstrings ran bold and wild  But fearful of himself to stand  Seiz'd his old tottering mother's hand  The church of  Rome  to which Mr  Pope  return'd after having written his  essay  on  man  for that he was a true romancatholick at the time of his writing that essay is a tale adapted merely to the credulity and ignorance of a  Racine  Unless indeed we have as little opinion of his judgment as his friend  Bolingbroke  had who is said to have ridicul'd him as one who understood nothing of his own principles nor saw to what they naturally led  Look back  Lorenzo  never thou  When set thy hand unto the plough  In vain we sacrifice to truth  The sportive giddiness of youth  If falshood's painted charms engage  The doting levity of age  Truth's thorny paths who fear to run  Should e'er her dang'rous portal shun  Nor set like heroes boldly out  To founder in the deeps of doubt  Yet ne'er forgettho' boldness thine  Temp'rance that boldness must refine  True temp'rance rational and brave  To stoick pride no sullen slave  Not such as gently meek and mild  Betrays the weakness of a child  Nor that without or fear or wit  By chance ev'n blunderers may get  The  rash  too angry to be bold  By falshood oft are bought and sold  The  proud  too haughty to be wise  See not where grov'ling errour lies  The  heedless  counts without his host  Or runs his nose against the post  And oft their tim'rous indolence  The  meek  indulge at truth's expence  So hard to keep that middle way  From which inquiry ne'er should stary  While for the task as hard to find  A truly firm capacious mind  No wonder fools the wouldbewise  Suppose in doubt that wisdom lies  Or that because so short their sight  Truth may be errour wrong be right  Cicero  somewhere observes there is no opinion however absurd which has not been espous'd by some or other of the philosophers And nothing surely can be more so than the famous inserence drawn from the weakness of the human understanding  i e  that because we do not comprehend ev'ry thing we in reality know nothing  Agrippa  it is true has declaim'd prettily and the ingenious Bishop of  Avranches  chopp'd logick as dextrously on the subject Yet alas such is the perverseness of commonsense that the greatest part of mankind even to this day do insist on the certainty of their knowing the right hand from the left  For ignorance to sooth its pride  Must seek its own defects to hide  Affecting hence all unbelief  Is  Scoto  infidel in chief  His hand and heart his ears and eyes  Confessing what his tongue denies  To truth in ev'ry system blind  Yet seeking it where none shall find  Lorenzo  here his wit a cheat  That mocks his judgment with deceit  Where'er opinion gaily dress'd  Runs gadding in her rainbow vest  Among her sisterhood a crew  Of motley wives black red or blue  See skeptick faith the truth in chase  Run giddily from face to face  Now this now that by turns enjoy  Nor find them false till found to cloy  Thus with the fair he most admires  Full soon the wav'ring lover tires  At morn her smiles with joy he meets  At night affronts her in the streets  By loose suspicion wand'ring led  Or spider fancy's flimsy thread  Till on some lying whore at last  He lights and holds her dogmas fast  Oppos'd to these nor strange to find  In uniformity combin'd  Believing thousands who suppose  Truth with a mob for ever goes  As if convinc'd the rabble rout  Because too obstinate to doubt  Yet customs old or fashions new  Are all th' unthinking herd pursue  The orthodox in dress and song  As modish as to right and wrong  Whatever country you go into let the religion be what it will the unthinking part thereof are always the reputed orthodox DED  to Essay on  SPIRIT  Of custom born to fashion bred  Thus blind credulity is led  While modes of faith like modes of dress  Mankind capriciously profess  Yet all agreed through shame or pride  Nature's simplicity to hide  Whate'er the fashion of the time  It holds the naked truth a crime  Thus to a man we find the crowd  To doubt too bashful or too proud  In errour rather chuse to fall  Than boast no scheme of faith at all  Impatient hence of stop or stay  They blunder on the broadest way  Or make a guide in ev'ry street  Of fool or knave the first they meet  Authorities how blind and lame  Hence bring the credulous to shame  While all revere the mould'ring page  Where moths have spent their

ARGUMENT  On Science as our guide to truthThe criterion best adapted to the opinion of individuals The absurdity of persecutionOur pretensions to divine and the bounds of human knowledge  SUMMARY  SCience though admitted as the rule of faith in matters relating to the investigation of truth is neither exclusive nor universal affecting only our opinion in speculative points For however refin'd are our  credenda  we insensibly join in our practical notions with the rest of mankind Whatever objection therefore scientifick inquirers may make to the systems of others none can be made to their fixing the criterion of truth on knowledge the certainty of which is by implication admitted in the general pretensions of mankind to  commonsense  This is the privilege of ev'ry mind without distinction enabling us equally to draw like conclusions from like premises All actual dispute therefore arises from some misunderstanding or different acceptation of the matter in question as the most ignorant peasant is equally certain of the proofs he comprehends with the greatest philosopher For the same reason nevertheless those would be engag'd in a desperate undertaking who should attempt to reconcile mankind to any one system of opinion the capacity and credulity of individuals being so very different in consequence of their diversity of temperament education and experience It is injurious and ridiculous therefore to insult others for thinking in the manner we ourselves should have done under the same circumstances It is still more absurd to reprobate the rest of mankind for not believing what we ourselves do not nor can possibly  be made to believe as is the case when we would impose tenets that either contradict themselves or are in fact downright nonsenseFor it is impossible to believe apparent falshood or to be convinc'd of any thing by a set of words that convey no determinate meaningMysterious or unintelligible propositions cannot therefore be believ'dIf the truth of revelation in general be admitted as what is reveal'd from Heaven must undoubtedly be true the difficulty of knowing what is particularly so or who are the truly inspir'd is yet inexplicably great Tho' the power of working miracles also be allow'd a proof of inspiration in the agent the fallacy of pretended ones and the suppos'd inspiration of impostors are almost invincible obstacles to our discovery of the truth The supposition also that real miracles are transgressions of the laws of nature is not at all necessary to support their veracity but argues the contrary and implies an injurious reflection on the omnipotence and prescience of the Deity Whatever reasonable objections however we may have against putting implicit faith in either pretended miracles or revelation yet as the utmost extent of scientifick discovery falls so infinitely short of a perfect knowledge of the designs and operations of Nature we cannot philosophically deny that God sometimes produces effects for ends best known to himself by means wholly unknown to us To proceed nevertheless in our inquiries on the most certain grounds the criterion of Science is to be neglected only in points indisputably and intelligibly reveal'd  EPISTLE THE  SECOND  NOR to the fount of  Hippocrene  Nor groves of laurel ever green  Nor where the wanton graces stray  With flow'rs is strown the muse's way  Lorenzo  no I more rejoice  At reason's bold and manly voice  Than at the softest sprightliest air  Mirth ever sung to lighten care  Truth's sober tale more pleas'd to hear  Than all that tickle fancy's ear  Tho' such to babbling echo sweet  Aloud the publick voice repeat  Our numbers then let truth excuse  If rudely sing th' unpolish'd muse  Careless of ornament and proud  To differ from the singsong crowd  So boastful of their poor pretence  To swell with sound their starveling sense  Truth hopes not for poetick praise  To fiction sacred are the bays  Dost thou  Lorenzo  still demur  So fearful in thy search to err  If plac'd thy faith on points alone  Whose truth demonstratively known  These much too few and too confin'd  To serve the purpose of mankind  Let a trite moral here advise  "Be not more credulous than wise"  Whatever doubts thy course impede  Seek not to amplify thy creed  By myst'ries dark or dogmas old  Because to son from father told  Severely to known truth confin'd  Of little faith were all mankind  Thy present arduous task my friend  No vague determinations end  Of practice speculation wide  Demands for thee a surer guide  If in the former prone to stray  The justling world oppose our way  While in the last are thousands flown  Past the world's knowledge or their own  "But hath this scientifick choice  "The suffrage of the general voice  "The means consistent with the end  "That truth which you yourself commend  See the begining of the first  Epistle  Lorenzo  see to commonsense  By commonsense is not meant any set of principles or method of logicizing established by custom But an innate capacity in all mankind to reason or draw conclusions from what they hear and see  How just how gen'ral the pretence  To nation climate age or sect  Unlimited without respect  Whence howsoever wide we stray  When church or system lead the way  All of necessity agree  In what alike they hear and see  For not a son of  Adam  's race  Innate conviction can efface  The highland loon the lowland lout  Wild  Irish  fierce and  Cambrian  stout  The boor that  Rhynland  's polder drains  Tho' reason slumber in his brains  All all like premises in view  Premises not only alike in terms but whose terms are alike understood  The like conclusions ever drew  For know that like our mother earth  Its human offspring at its birth  Where fertile clay and barren sand  Compose the variegated land  Th' unequal strata of the soil  Unequally demand our toil  The rich that toil with gain repay  Thrown on the poor our pains away  In man's uncultivated mind  So varied is the soil in kind  The flow'rs of science fresh and fair  On some expand without our care  On others scarce by culture grow  The buds that wither as they blow  Yet here essentially allied  However else diversified  The fertile marl the steril sand  Alike the seed or plant demand  Denied no more spontaneous grain  To  Bergen  's rocks than  Baioe  's plain  The country near  Baioe  celebrated by  Pliny  and others as the most fruitful part of  Italy Nullus in orbe locus  says  Horace Baiis praelucet amoenis  Agreeable to the above sentiment it is at present called  Terra di Lavoro  So not a truth innate our own  Tho' we have not all by nature an equal capacity to acquire knowledge our minds may nevertheless be justly consider'd as originally  tabuloe rasoe  in which there may be a very essential difference however as to their aptitude for impression  The seeds of knowledge must be sown  Experience slow must swell the root  And tend the fibres as they shoot  Or speedier aid instruction grant  And slips of foreign growth implant  The mental and material claim  Here too essentially the same  Grow seed or plant where'er it will  In kind 'tis propagated still  No soil nor climate can produce  In tares the barley's potent juice  To thorns no culture can assign  The purple honours of the vine  Thus when by simple nature's aid  Put forth sensation's tender blade  If to perfection nearer brought  It bloom and ripen into thought  Wherever situate the root  The same its intellectual fruit  Its taste its form perhaps we blame  But still its genus is the same  In this no poverty of soil  No dullness ever mock'd our toil  If vainly then in letter'd pride  The scholar deep is dignified  So false so empty the pretence  Of wits to more than commonsense  If plain to th' idiot as to you  Th' immediate object of his view  While ev'n the blockhead truly knows  Far as his little science goes  Consistent sure our confidence  In search of truth on commonsense  That gen'ral index to mankind  See Epistle the first  To taste and genius unconfin'd  Pointing in all one common way  By dullness shorten'd but its ray  Of wit and knowledge all

So when to cheat the partial sight  And prove in mirth that black is white  With lights dispos'd the shades between  In folds is spread the artful scene  Oppos'd the colours strike the eye  And he affirms what you deny  Here  spotless all appears and fair  Perceiv'd a total blackness  there  The demonstration of his sight  Who doubts who knows not black from white  Thus evidence supports dispute  Nor one the other can refute  And yet is commonsense to blame  The premises were not the same  Were these alike tho' say you err  Both would infallibly concur  For take each others point of sight  And set at once the matter right  From the consideration of the different appearances of circumstances and things to different minds many of the  Academicks  fagaciously concluded there was no criterion whereby we might distinguish between reality and appearance truth and falshood A deduction ridiculous enough For in the words of Mr  Pope  If black and white blend soften and unite  A thousand ways is there no black or white  Conceive not then because we find  One source of truth in ev'ry mind  We individuals think to see  At ev'ry time and place agree  As well amidst yon grove of trees  While plays a constant eastern breeze  Each single spray we hope to find  In one direction west reclin'd  For tho' to truth alike our claim  Our taste nor sentiments the same  For dusky green the jaundic'd eye  Mistakes the clearblue summer sky  The distant scene however bright  Is darkness to the short of sight  To loaded ears as whispers still  The clack and thunder of the mill  Thus lost as colours on the blind  On dullness qualities refin'd  Than musick to the deaf no more  To ignorance th' abstracted lore  Hence oft objection calls us out  To satisfy the blockhead's doubt  Who not one proof whereon depends  His sought solution comprehends  Tous ceux  says a certain French author  qui sont capable de faire des objectons ne sont pas toujours en etat de comprendre tous les principes dont depend la resolution de leurs objections  The tritest arguments of yore  In vain repeated o'er and o'er  Proving how fruitless were the toil  The jarring world to reconcile  And yet as but from time and place  Our sev'ral modes of thought we trace  Alas how blindly do we run  Each others heresy to shun  Our own our glory and our pride  While curses all the rest betide  By pious children doom'd their sire  By sires their children to hellfire  Heirs to salvation's brighter sphere  So strangely damn'd and damning here  Thus  Calvin  ignorantly raves  At souls which therefore  Luther  saves  To both denied Lord  Peter  's keys  Who shuts out hereticks like these  And yet ev'n those who boast to feel  Their bosoms burn with christian zeal  Who dooming mussulmen to hell  With pride uncharitable swell  In  Naz'reth  bred or  Bethle'm  born  Had laugh'd our Saviour's birth to scorn  Mere Turks denounc'd for you and me  The bitter fruit of  Zacon  's tree  To eat with fiends below the doom  Of  AntiMahomet  and  Rome  Yet blind as  Sampson  when despair  Had sunk his life below his care  The numbers wanton  Gaza  lost  Destroy'd but at his proper cost  Halfwitted Zeal of all the test  Itself condemns among the rest  For if requir'd by gracious Heaven  Our service but as knowledge given  Should I in Pope or Mufti trust  For proving to their tenets just  Your rule to censure me or mine  Holds the like condemnation thine  Therefore thou art inexcusable O man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thy self  Yet still more wicked weak and blind  This reprobating zeal we find  When void of truth absurd and vain  The tenets zealots thus maintain  Oh how ridiculous and odd  That zeal precipitate for God  So short of knowledge  I bear them record  says  ST PAUL  of the Jews  that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge  that indeed  It understands not ev'n its creed  For know whate'er the world pretend  But few believe what they defend  In modes of faith tho' falsehood taught  Nonsense is equally their fault  Thousands by forms of speech deceiv'd  Ne'er yet by mortal man believ'd  Creeds penn'd as said at Heaven's command  In terms no soul can understand  Or such tho' thunder'd from on high  That plainly give themselves the lie  But sure if words no sense convey  Faith in their utt'rance dies away  Nor can a single son of  Eve  Apparent falsehood e'er believe  A man may perhaps believe a proposition to be true tho' he cannot conceive how it can possibly be so but he never can sincerely believe a position that contradicts itself or is evidently false Thus I may believe that one man has rais'd another from the dead tho' I cannot understand by what means it can possibly be true but I can never actually believe that  two  are but  one  and that the same  one  is at the same time  two  because it is a contradiction in terms and apparently impossible  Belief no vague declaimer's rant  No bigot's creed no sophist's cant  'Tis not the scripture text to quote  To get our catechism by rote  O'er homilies to spend the day  At midnight half asleep to pray  To chatter matins at the dawn  Or gabble with the man of lawn  True faith that consciousness of soul  That times nor accidents control  Save those adapted and combin'd  To root conviction from the mind  For know that neither threats nor blows  Sincere belief can e'er impose  The monk's hot zeal the jesuit's skill  Lead not conviction as they will  Go turn inquisitor and burn  The hereticks all round in turn  The Turk refusing to resign  His sensual paradise for thine  The Indian that in death pretends  To visit but his former friends  Unless his faith what you may tell  Of joys in Heav'n and pains in Hell  Not one of all the suffering tribe  Thy sentiments perforce imbibe  Howe'er induc'd by hope or fear  The mind is no free agent here  To change their faith beyond the power  Of martyrs at their dying hour  How idly then enthusiasts rave  Of systems that will damn or save  Or think true proselytes to gain  By torture gallows whip or chain  Since ever constant to its cause  True faith depends on nature's laws  By nonsense nor caprice misled  The honest heart and sober head  How idly wild fanaticks preach  While ignorant of what they teach  The spirit ne'er affects the mind  Unless with th' understanding join'd  Nor hath the word if void of sense  To gospel pow'r the least pretence  The nonsense of our modern saints is therefore equally reprehensible with the affectation of speaking in unknown tongues so severely censur'd in the Apostle's first letter to the  Cor  chap  Some certain meaning hence and plain  A saving faith must needs contain  If fix'd its object sure no less  The sense of terms our creed express  A parrot else if none deceive her  A sound and orthodox believer  Convinc'd as much as ever yet  The Athanasian paroquet  That the  Athanasians  believe  nothing  by the creed they profess might be perhaps too harsh to say as we confess that  after the way which they call heresy  we believe it ourselves but that they deceive themselves in supposing they really believe  what  they say is for the above reasons very evident  Let not fanaticism deceive  None can a mystery believe  That is a mysterious or nonintelligible proposition as the real assent or dissent of the mind must necessarily succeed some determinate conception of the premises laid down so that no man can possibly believe a position he does not understand  Tho' plung'd by zeal in errour deep  While commonsense lies fast asleep  Their faith rash bigots strangely boast  The strongest his who's cheated most  Who least for truth presumes to search  But headlong runs into the church  For laid thy hand upon thy heart  The formule of thy creed impart  Dost thou its substance comprehend  Lo all its mystery's at an end  In spite of their misguiding zeal  Here to their hearts let all appeal  Enough if just be their pretence  To honesty and commonsense  Here rests that umpire of mankind  Conscience the God within the mind  At eastern temples as of yore  Without the threshold of the door  In reverence did the zealot use  To doff and leave his dirty shoes  Like him the modern faithful taught  That reason is a thing of naught  Lest they should soil the church with doubt  Their understandings leave without  For ask who thus in mystery trust  If  Euclid  's demonstration's just  If truth the geometrick art  Or subtile algebra impart  Unknowing what precisely meant  They honestly resuse assent  Consess they first must comprehend  Before they credit or contend  O self condemn'd O dead to shame  Have these a conscience void of blame  Who take no worldly points on trust  But scruple till they know them just  Yet their supreme concerns will rest  On tenets half the world contest  Conviction openly defie  And with their tongues their hearts belie  These the true faithful shall we call  These have alas no faith at all  For howsoe'er with art they strive  To keep absurdity alive  Cloath'd in equivocal disguise  Or garb of truth their specious lies  Still commonsense unrooted out  Will find a flaw to fix a doubt  And where one doubt is left behind  No firm belief informs the mind  Yet is there whose officious zeal  Pretends a consciousness to feel  A fix'd internal evidence  Of axioms hid from commonsense  A stronger testimony given  By inspiration breath'd from Heaven  Lorenzo  neither you nor I  What God reveals can e'er deny  But here how needful to be wise  To know where revelation lies  Art thou thyself inspir'd by Heav'n  Tell me what certain proof is given  Dost thou intuitively view  What reason tells thee must be true  No revelation here requir'd  How proves such truth that thou'rt inspir'd  For why inspir'd if but to tell  What reason might have told as well  As truth beholds thy mental eye  What seems to all the world a lie  Thy proof imagination strong  Here also mayst thou still be wrong  From Heav'n if ever fir'd conceit  Brandy has also done the feat  Nay oft th' infatuate of brain  Of Heav'n's presum'd injunctions vain  Have madly broke its dread commands  And dipt in blood their murd'ring hands  If God or devil then inspire  Of reason still we must inquire  And reason doubtless would reply  "Heav'n never yet reveal'd a lie"  On others gifts confiding more  Dost give thine own pretensions o'er  Dost from th' inspir'd thy faith receive  And pin it on thy neighbour's sleeve  Reason or Heav'n must tell thee too  If such be more inspir'd than you  "Where then the proof" I frankly own  To me yet uninspir'd unknown  Such guides to me by madness fir'd  As madmen  More properly perhaps  idiots  The sentiment as it thus stands is Dr  Whichcote  's  with the Turks inspir'd  In spite of  Middleton  and  Hume  Dost thou on miracles presume  To revelation these thy guide  Thy faith by wonders verified  Go thou and easy of belief  My comrade ask if I'm a thief  If inspiration false and true  Sure miracles suspicious too  And hence thy conduct most absurd  To take for one the other's word  Our souls how long to damn and save  Hath subtile priestcraft play'd the knave  Its pupils train'd from early youth  T'equivocate and hide the truth  To practise the deception nice  Of tricking hand or quaint device  To cheat the palate nose and eye  And gild that dirty pill a lie  Yet dost thou miracles maintain  Be here thy definition plain  The muse disdaining to reply  To such as shock the naked eye  i e  palpable impostures  Events as miracles dost own  Whose cause immediate is unknown  Or is thy faith establish'd more  On actions ne'er perform'd before  Alas my much believing friend  The times of yore might these defend  When heretick freethinkers rose  That dar'd the holy church oppose  For infidelity renown'd  Asserting that the globe was round  Vile heresy whence doom'd to hell  Upsal  's good bishop martyr fell  Wretches so impious as to hold  The earth about its axis roll'd  And as the years their courses run  Still took its journeys round the sun  Vile heresy for which 'tis said  Old  Galileo  too had bled  Had not the sage more loth to die  Recanting damn'd it for a lie  According to the terms of Abjuration  Ego  Galileo  corde sincero et fide non ficta abjuro  maledico  et detestor supradictos errores et baereses  In days of ignorance like these  When legends had the pow'r to please  While love of wonder salv'd deceit  And gudgeons swallow'd whole the cheat  How little strange that monks and fryars  Should prove miraculously liars  Or converts to divines so sad  Turn out miraculously mad  But now a century worn away  Time working wonders ev'ry day  The vast discov'ries years have made  Have spoilt the wondermonger's trade  Sayst thou events so strange of yore  Since now miraculous no more  True miracles thou wouldst define  As real acts of power divine  Th' effects of some immediate cause  In fact transgressing nature's laws  This is Mr  Hume  's definition of a miracle to which however we do not subscribe as it appears to us to supersede the very possibility of miracles the reality of which cannot be philosophically denied As from several late discoveries it appears that the knowledge of mankind in physical causes and effects is not sufficiently extensive to establish a negative against any pretended phenomenon whatever It should be consider'd also that the truth of miracles does not depend on the reality of the facts represented but on the veracity of that representation Neither doth the certainty of the fact appear at all needful to the end for which miracles were confessedly intended for the apparent effect of a supernatural power would have the same influence on the spectator as a real one as it is by appearance only we judge of reality  Howdid th' omnipotent on high  Let those his laws at random fly  Or was his providence so blind  To what omnisciency design'd  That still his sov'reign will attends  To strike his foes or skreen his friends  That pow'r beyond th' Almighty's art  To nature's system to impart  Needful Heav'n's arbitrary fire  To blast a figtree or a liar  Lorenzo  be not thou so vain  To think thus brittle nature's chain  From which whatever link we strike  Tenth or ten thousandth

in time the  God  attend  The works of his own hand to mend  Alas how blasphemous to say  That Heav'n can save no other way  Or that for trifles or in joke  Creation's sacred order's broke  The accounts given us of the miracles of our Saviour and his Apostles cannot however be denied whether we suppose the facts really or only apparently to have happen'd as in either case the perceptible effects might flow from natural causes unknown to philosophy yet adapted in the general system of things to answer the ends of providence  For do we not in fact confess  If God may nature's laws transgress  The wise creator wanted skill  His vast intentions to fulfil  Or that th' intention tho' his own  Was in th' extent to him unknown  Or still more impiously imply  That Heav'n can give itself the lie  Say then that miracles there be  They're but miraculous to thee  So many links conceal'd remain  Which form the complicated chain  True causes and effects between  In Nature's providential scene  What tho' without an obvious cause  We see inverted custom's laws  Must we immediately infer  That nature from itself can err  Commanded by the  word  divine  Say water chang'd

may act  praeter  tho' not  contra scientiam naturae  the supposition however is not at all necessary to justifie our belief in miracles  Might not ten thousand springs unite  Causes too fine for mortal sight  Such varied wonders to produce  To providential ends of use  Form'd when by Heav'n its pow'r display'd  The earth's foundation first was laid  Or when that  Logos  The  word St John  chap I  was design'd  By miracles to save mankind  Think not  Lorenzo  nature strays  Whene'er the world is in amaze  Extend thy view from pole to pole  See one great miracle the whole  Where all events their cause succeed  As once the great  first cause  decreed  Where order still from order flows  And never interruption knows  Capricious but to mortal sense  The harmony of providence  How strangely therefore bigots err  Who wonders to plain facts prefer  With list'ning ear who love to range  And greedy eye for all that's strange  Rejecting their creator's plan  The voice of God for that of man  Besides thy miracles confin'd  To former ages of mankind  Nature in these our latter days  Unmov'd by pray'r and deaf to praise  Ne'er turning back nor led aside  To help our wants or

jew or gentile's sake  Since howsoe'er the truth conceal'd  None trust in miracles reveal'd  Unless learn'd  Jortin  's  Or rather that of  Maimonides  a Jew of whom Dr  Jortin  says he borrowed it

On the infatuation of mankind respecting paradox and mysteries The effects and causes of such infatuation The absurdity of supposing ignorance and folly the means to promote the cause of truth or that the freedom of scientifick enquiry is incompatible with the political welfare of society  SUMMARY  IT is remarkable that notwithstanding the universality of those truths which are founded on  commonsense  mankind have ever been so infatuated as to reject this general and obvious criterion for the more particular dogmas and mysterious paradoxes of pretended revelation The moral effects of this infatuation exemplified in our superficial attachment to religion our indolent security in time of prosperity and our transitory astonishment and penitence under the immediate weight of misfortune An absurd scheme of education the grand cause of that cowardice and imbecility of mind which render us so ridiculous in speculation and inconsistent in practice The misapplication of their talents therefore who think by encreasing such weakness to promote the cause of truth or the interest of religion and morality is plac'd in a ridiculous light as the just object of censure The supposition also that ignorance and implicit subjection to authority are necessary to the wellbeing of society or the political happiness of mankind is exploded and shown to be exemplarily false and absurd polity in general as well as religion and private virtue in particulars being founded on truth and nature and not dependant on the chimerical productions of fancy the low artifices of faction or the knavish cunning of designing falsehood  EPISTLE THE  THIRD  IF truth in science we may find  Its root implanted in the mind  To this so just the world's pretence  On the plain rules of

Employ'd her fables to rehearse  While thou O sacred truth remain  The theme of ev'ry humbler strain  And yet if true what each pretends  How num'rous are her rhyming friends  While such her fond admirers prove  And tune their rival songs to love  But fools in fondness as in awe  The truth 'tis plain they never saw  And but themselves her lovers boast  Because her name the publick toast  So

turns the wit and fool  The monarch's and the printer's tool  The jest the genius of the age  Till hiss'd and pelted off the stage  Whence now no more his lyre he strings  For tyrant booksellers and kings  But fir'd with vanity and spleen  Dotes on the truth unsought unseen  Chaunting so happy to be  free  Enraptur'd rhymes on liberty  Such lovers truth must e'er despise  Who see her but with borrow'd eyes  Who only play the lover's part  No real passion at the heart  For say what lover's passion true  For beauty that he never knew  So eastern monarchs love their wives  Tho' barren strangers all their lives  So lov'd  la Mancha  's famous knight  The fair for whom he swore to fight  Fir'd by th' enthusiastick rage  With men and monsters to engage  Yet ask'd for whom this martial strife  "He never saw her in het life  "Nor was he positive God wot  "Whether indeed she liv'd or not"  Thus bards too oft in truth's defence  Break through the rules of commonsense  And o'er his

That seeing imitate the blind  In spite of truth and open day  In darkness chuse to grope their way  Suspecting plainness of disguise  The obvious sense of terms despise  From sound or derivation

from the clouds  And therefore gaping up in th'air  On errour stumbled unaware  Thus an astrologer of old  In learned history we're told  Contemplating the milky way  Neglected that before him lay  And led by wand'ring planets fell  Unluckily into a well  Yet e'er with slander branding those  Who sought the naked truth t' expose  Short sighted mortals in their pride  Thus strove their ignorance

the plains  In mildly soft descending rains  In their due season harvests smile  And plenty crowns the peasant's toil  As nothing rare as nothing new  We take the blessing as our due  For O prosperity's a lot  At ease enjoy'd with ease forgot  In June's warm sun and April's shower  We trace not an Almighty power  Ingrates so light of Heav'n we make  Nor think the hand that gives may take

freely trace  Whence grows a cowardice so base  At th' early dawn of moral sense  Th' infatuation did commence  And propagated since by art  We all have more or less a part  Ere hermit bald or pilgrim grey  Had worn the solitary way  Ere yet the monk had told his beads  Ere yet credulity or creeds  To school with sober  Reason  sent  Young  Genius  to  Experience  went  The latter tho' as yet 'tis true  No wiser than the former two  In charge the tender pupils took  And with them read in nature's book  So pedagogues unletter'd use  No class of blockheads to refuse  But gravely undertake t' explain  The arts themselves must first attain  Sufficient if the master goes  Before his blund'ring pupil's nose  Careful his vacant hours t'employ  Now  Reason  prov'd a hopeful boy  But  Genius  insolent and wild  By nature an assuming child  A treach'rous memory his lot  The little that he learn'd forgot  Nor gave himself a moment's pain  To con his lessons o'er again  But trusting to his forward parts  Debauch'd with wit the sister  arts  Who yet unsettled young and frail  Enamour'd listen'd to his tale  And since the cause of dire disputes  Turn'd out abandon'd prostitutes  By priest

the subject led me to make on cotemporary writers  Whose motley muse in florid strain  With owls did to the moon complain  Clear'd at the morn her raven throat  To sound the glibber magpye's note

 To damn selfmurderers to heaven  Why then is sought the midnight shade  From vice or falsehood to dissuade  Is night less vicious than the day  Doth errour guide the solar ray  Or is exhal'd like

nature and the incongruity of pretended atheism  SUMMARY  AS it is necessary to our success in scientifick researches that the mind should be divested of its prejudices in favour of tradition and custom so however extensive be the freedom of enquiry it is equally necessary that the object of investigation be adapted to the limits of the understanding mankind always falling into errour and confusion in their attempts to discover the knowledge of things beyond their capacity However true therefore may be many of our discoveries in the system of Nature  God  the authour of that system is abstracted from it and above our comprehension Hence our pretensions to describe or define the  Deity  are palpably absurd and ridiculous For tho' a created Being may ascribe to its creator the most respectable of all known perfections yet as all its ideas of perfection are relative to itself the attributes human beings ascribe to God are necessarily the superior qualities of  humanity  Notwithstanding however the Deity is so far removed from our enquiries and thereby confessedly no object of philosophical knowledge yet the actual disbelief of the existence of a God is denied the arguments for and against atheists composing in fact a very ridiculous dispute as the impossibility of denying the being of a  first cause  is evident and the rest of the controversy a mere cavil about words of no determinate meaning  EPISTLE THE  FOURTH  RUL'D by no giant hopes or fears  Whose stature grows with length of years  In search of truth expect to find  The labour suited to the mind  With genius nature bearing part  The strict yet gentle nurse of art  Then aim not thou a point to hit  Above the reach of human wit  As if mankind could judge of aught  Beyond th' ability of thought  Join not  Lorenzo  blindly those  Who first would nature's God disclose  Their moral and religious schemes  Building on theologick dreams  Deduc'd the principles they own  From others equally unknown  For say the voice of reason true  Be ours a just abstracted view  Be it the privilege of man  To trace exactly nature's plan  The scale of beings in his hands  To know the point at which he stands  Compar'd with all he boasts to know  As well above him as below  Yet if of human logick vain  He link to Heav'n a kindred chain  Conclusions idle soon he draws  And Heav'n prescribes by human laws  Imagine thou in what degree  A seraph stands 'tween God and thee  The neck how lowly dost thou bend  Before thy bright seraphick friend  But place thyself a mite unseen  And being infinite between  In this comparison says pride  A seraph thou to God allied  Thy pride  Lorenzo  disbelieve  Let  Locke  nor  Addison  deceive  For tho' creation's varied plan  Assigns degrees respecting man  Yet bigot know and learn to fear  God is beyond thy proper sphere  Created beings all his care  Doth he with them creation  share  Ah no the system all our own  God the creator stands alone  At equal distance all his plan  The mite the seraph or the man  Is it not so the passive clay  Of yon Corinthian column gay  That gilt entablature or base  Or marble of yon shining vase  Resemble more the artist's mind  Than if to meaner use consign'd  Absurd is  Jones  's genius known  By the great model or the stone  The pile erect to  Trajan  's name  Affected not by empty fame  The cross rever'd the honour'd bust  And trodden floor are kindred dust  For all in one degree respect  Their sov'reign lord the architect  How justly then soe'er we plead  That reason  nature's  book doth read  As by its known establish'd laws  Of each effect we trace the cause  Those laws can ne'er themselves confine  The legislative power divine  Whose will those very laws decreed  And bad th' effect the cause succeed  Agent in some superior scheme  Of which in this we can but dream  Bear  Atticus  the critick's rod  In vain we then define a God  In vain we attributes bestow  Or reason here from what we know  Tho' science teach religion warm  What wild ideas still we form  Imperfect embrios of the brain  That strive to scale the Heav'ns in vain  Too short to reach beyond the sky  The focus of the mental eye  Too cold our most transporting zeal  To paint what heav'ns and light conceal  Yet will the skeptick ask me why  Go rise and to the dogstar fly  Thou canst not nor the cause unknown  Central attraction holds thee down  A pow'r occult which ere thy birth  Fast bound thee to thy native earth  From which thou ne'er canst hope to rise  To lunar plains or solar skies  Nor less within it's sphere confin'd  The subtile essence of the mind  What tho' it boast the pow'r to rove  In freedom through the plains above  Tho' wing'd it's active feet to run  With  Merc'ry  round the central sun  Giv'n it far distant worlds t' explore  And seas of space without a shore  Yet still within creation's round  Within our narrow system bound  Of what's above or what without  We harbour universal doubt  Say light prevails no contrast shade  Outlines the void we would prevade  If darkness reign no chearing ray  Delineates blind inquiry's way  Hence mortal man must ever be  Thy authour God unknown to thee  Destin'd thy erring way to trace  Through nature's particolour'd space  Let ign'rance then her idol dress  In justice love and happiness  Adorn with mercy's golden chain  With all the virtues grace its train  And then adore in humble plight  Calling those fopp'ries infinite  The pagan thus despis'd as blind  Creates his idol to his mind  Thinking his deity express'd  By bird or beast he likes the best  Then bows before the painted shrine  And calls his wooden God divine  Cast the presumptuous thought aside  'Tis not humility but pride  Unless that truly humble we  T' adore the God  humanity  And such it is for whence arise  Our virtues but from moral ties  Whose known relations thus define  That essence mortals call divine  Lorenzo  ready for reply  Lay not thy prompt objection by  Thou sayst "thy friend himself deceives  "Nor God adores nor God believes  "For tho' the mind the pow'r descry  "If left its essence in the sky  "If none imagin'd or display'd  "To nothing adoration paid  "In me no certain faith is found  "My deity an empty found"  Not so for granting I confess  Thy attributes a God express  Thou sayst thyself "still undefin'd  "The perfect by th' imperfect mind"  And to thy attributes must join  Thy  infinite  or thy  divine  As jugglers who t' enhance deceit  To sacred science give their cheat  While with the curtain still they hide  The slight of hand too closely eyed  So sly theologues here impart  The  hocus pocus  of their art  Holding religion's sacred veil  Where slights of understanding fail  For know alas their wisest plan  Displays but a superiour man  Whom infinite the conjurer's rod  Presto converts into a God  Till then they solve our problem right  And tell us what is infinite  They still must be reduc'd to own  Their compound deity unknown  To all or reasoning or inspir'd  This infinite a term requir'd  Differs  Lorenzo  then with me  In terms alone we disagree  Perfection infinite is thine  Indefinite perfection mine  Condemn not then half understood  I not deny that perfect good  Allgracious merciful and wife  God reigns supreme beyond the skies  For to deny that the moral perfections ascrib'd to God are in no degree or affinity whatever his proper attributes would be as unphilosophical as to assert on the other hand that our ideas of goodness justice mercy c are strictly applicable to the deity  Neither 'tis true my terms imply  But granting none I none deny  Requiring but to acquiesce  That thou thy  infinite  express  Idly doth  Bolingbroke  refine  Granting that wisdom is divine  While as absurdly he denies  Justice and goodness to the skies  Ideas equally our own  Our goodness as our wisdom's known  To both as hard to reconcile  Or nature's frown or nature's smile  Alas no attributes of thine  Can e'er the deity define  Impossible to judge or know  Of God above from man below  At least so far as to judge of his providential designs or ultimate determinations from our suppos'd knowledge of his attributes for how shall we know what may be consistent or inconsistent with God's justice and goodness when even moral goodness and justice between man and man are points in dispute  Reserv'd the prospect of the skies  To gratify immortal eyes  Lorenzo  let us reason right  No finite spans an infinite  Unless with  Matho  vers'd in arts  We hold th' infinity of  parts  But none th' absurdity will plan  That God can be contain'd in man  Tho' as absurdly they suppose  Our partial gifts the God disclose  Joinst thou with  Florio  the dispute  T' enhance each moral attribute  Pretending "these however crude  "Divine perfection doth include  "As species in a genus they  "Or parts which join'd the whole display"  So with the grandeur all t'inspire  Of the gay mansion of his fire  An idiot heir his mother's fool  Taught his synecdochÃ© at school  Conceiv'd by part the whole was shown  And took a sample of the  stone  Convinc'd doth  Polydore  with me  That God's indefinite agree  Yet argue "that our partial view  "May still be relatively true  "For if no abstract lights we gain  "'Tis just our best to entertain  "Our God to call that wond'rous cause  "In nature trac'd by nature's laws"  Mistake not here nor God dethrone  The first mechanick cause be known  'Tis of some prior cause th' effect  Which no known similars respect  The God we then by this define  Nor selfexistent nor divine  Be known creation's various ties  Whence physical relations rise  Of each effect the various cause  Attraction and repulsion's laws  That  primum mobilÃ©  be found  That drove  Des Cartes'  whirlpools round  Let matter motion ether join  To form thy attributes divine  Striving if possible to rise  To the first agent in the skies  Be next explain'd to mortal sense  The wond'rous scheme of providence  Down from those great important springs  On which rebounds the fate of kings  To those so exquisitely small  Destin'd to let the sparrow fall  Sayst thou the knowledge hence deriv'd  Of him those systems hath contriv'd  Alas from hence we only trace  The features of creation's face  The front it bears to human kind  But not its selfexisting mind  Should we presuming to display  The spirit of the golden day  Thus call its essence its result  Attraction fire alike occult  Or say 'tis vegetation green  Who'd think it is the  sun  we mean  So here t' absurdity we fall  Nor thus define a God at all  Yet while to thee I freely own  I reverence a God unknown  Think not through ignorance or pride  A God was ever yet denied  No atheist  By an  atheist  is meant simply one that denies the existence of a GodDivines indeed give that name to skepticks and deists indifferenty  Dr South  if I remember right seems to have thought it more easy to be a  speculative  than a  practical  atheist though in the strict sense of the word whatever we conclude concerning the latter the former appears to me impossible  e'er was known on earth  Till fiery zealots gave him birth  For controversy's sake their trade  And damn'd the heretick they made  Doth  Clody  impudent and vain  Deny a God in skeptick strain  And yet in ignorance advance  That nature is the work of chance  Theologists absurdly wise  With their anathemas despise  For well may  Clody  these inflame  Whose God exists but in a name  A technick term devis'd at school  I pity  Clody  as a  fool  To  Epicurus  ' strains belong  The censures of an idle song  For say "united worlds might join  "By accident and not design  "Atoms  might luckily  contrive  "And strangely find themselves alive  "Or by some other scheme as wild  "The world be fortune's fav'rite child"  Explain the termssay what is meant  By atoms fortune accident  What meanst thou but th' efficient cause  Of nature's works and nature's laws  O think not then th' eternal mind  To term or epithet confin'd  But take away or change the name  And  Clody  's God and mine's the same  Sayst thou "in  chance  a pow'r defin'd  "Fortuitous absurd and blind  "Unworthy that stupendous plan  "Which nature's scenes display to man  "Where grace with harmony allied  "And wisdom strike on ev'ry side"  Alas to  Clody  these unknown  For wond'rous wisdom's all his own  In nature nothing he surveys  That actuates his soul to praise  In vain the planets ran their course  Obedient to impulsive force  Th' excentrick comets far and wide  Pursue the same unerring guide  In vain describes their varied race  In equal times an equal space  In vain through microscopick eyes  Innumerable wonders rise  On the green leaf whole nations crawl  And myriads perish in its fall  Ah me what bears the barren mind  What beauty can affect the blind  Should  Clody  then his  chance  disclaim  And own a deity by name  The blund'ring deist would advance  A God no wiser than his chance  Boasts nature therefore no  design  Say whence  Lorenzo  yours and mine  Did wisdom's sons themselves create  Their birth 'tis own'd they owe to

Atheism  's a mere tho' impious  jest  How obvious is the truth and yet  What learned volumes have been writ  How scholiasts labour to refute  Where none do actually dispute  Of the firstcause or

Heav'n asks no more  In  spirit  and in  truth  t'adore  EPISTLE THE  FIFTH  ARGUMENT  On happiness The apparent incapacity of mankind for its enjoyment The comparative pain and pleasure of human sensations and their relation to our physical and moral constitution  SUMMARY  NEXT to the absurdity of puzzling ourselves in the investigation of matters beyond our capacity and equally an obstacle to our inquiries after truth is the folly of our constant pursuit and in spite of as constant disappointments our expectations of  happiness  The term is certainly left vague and illdefin'd even by those philosophers who pretending it to be attainable affect to teach us how happiness may be acquir'dIts meaning is nevertheless obvious and is determined from the tenour of its acceptation with the generality of mankind In which sense it is shown to be hitherto unattain'd and that not only from the impossibility of  externals  to confer happiness but from the evident incapacity of human beings to be made happyIt is hence also declar'd unattainable and even the most laudable means whereby it is pursued as those of knowledge religion and virtue are experimentally and logically shown to be incapable of conferring happiness In fact ev'ry state age and condition of life having its several distinct anxieties and consolations it appears that a continued sense of either happiness or misery is incompatible with our nature as well as with the very essence of pleasure and pain in general our sensations of both which are merely comparative and reciprocally necessary to that of each other Whence happiness and misery are evidently relative to and dependant on the constitution of the human frame with which abstract pain and pleasure are totally inconsistent  EPISTLE THE  FIFTH  BEyond the science of mankind  In nature's fane our God enshrin'd  Content  Lorenzo  let us trace  The lines the shaddow of his face  In humble boldness seek to know  Our heav'n on earth our God below  To face the sun to beat the sky  Demand an eagle's wing and eye  Ah let not then mere birds of night  Whose wings whose opticks check their flight  Encourag'd by the morning ray  To risk the sunshine of the day  Their feeble pow'rs too highly rate  And rush absurdly on their fate  As in the noontide beams they gaze  Struck blind by Heav'ns meridian blaze  For ever after to their cost  To grope in endless errour lost  Adapted then inquiry's plan  To truths as relative to man  Wouldst thou  Lorenzo  comprehend  Man's physical and moral end  To future to immortal views  Conducted by the faithful muse  Secure while yet in reason's sight  For thee she takes her daring flight  Born up on scientifick wing  Attempts her boldest note to sing  For thee those winding tracts t'explore  Where seldom muse hath dar'd to soar  But here as truth we hope to find  Be left each vain desire behind  Be thrown those obstacles aside  Which expectation builds on pride  While busy hope and bustling care  Erect their castles in the air  Our fertile wishes safe to hold  Fertile in pleasure fame or gold  A treasure valued at no less  Than man's consummate happiness  For know if bliss thy end and aim  Truth but invalidates thy claim  Th' exclusive privilege to  know  The all we taste of Heav'n below  Is this a maxim wits profess  "That man was born to happiness  "Tho' tow'rs of hope he fondly raise  "Their structure lasts him all his days  "In expectation ev'n possessing  "The better half of ev'ry blessing  "His bliss for ever in his view  "Whene'er he pleases to pursue"  My friend with care such maxims weigh  Nor run with giddy wits astray  In search of truth may genius roam  But bliss if found is found at home  To region clime nor soil confin'd  This boasted seed of Heav'nly kind  Ah vainly boasted if below  The plant celestial cannot grow  Say sophists neither more nor less  Than happiness is happiness  Yet will they boast this state unknown  This bliss indefinite their own  The diff'rence plain 'twixt bliss and woe  Whate'er we feel we surely know  What state can then be ever thine  Which sense nor science can define  That man by others is't confess'd  Ne'er  is  but always  to be  blest  Yet would they teach in moral strain  How all may happiness attain  As well who ne'er was bless'd with light  May boast the happiness of sight  The splendour of the solar ray  Or teach his comrades blind their way  As such to thee make ever known  A state of being ne'er their own  Dost thou to prove my judgment wrong  In answer quote thy fav'rite song  True bliss thy  Pope  if we believe  All hands can reach all heads conceive  See  Pope  's essay on man  The happiness of each confin'd  In truth to that of all our kind  Know terms so gen'ral naught define  The bliss of  all  nor  yours  nor  mine  As yet distinctly understood  The  publick  and the  private  good  Nor doth it prove this maxim right  To say that both in one unite  Unless their union be so plain  That seeking one we both obtain  Since th'individual for himself  Applies to riot fame or pelf  In spite of all the wise can say  We seek our bliss a sep'rate way  Just as the present maggots bite  Take our own measures for the right  Or having no peculiar whim  Along the tide of custom swim  Meanwhile of bliss tho' all dispute  None leave their darling substitute  How short of happiness is gold  The miser cries yet keeps his hold  In women sighs the batter'd rake  What solid comfort can we take  Ah what in wine  Silenus  asks  Yet cart the whore go stave the casks  "How shall the sons of  Comus  live  "If wine nor women life doth give"  Thus publick happiness our care  But for our own peculiar share  While sons their father's schemes traduce  And here all patriotism abuse  However then the specious face  Of wit may countenance the case  Bliss inconsistently we call  The happiness of  one  and  all  Nor is it yet precisely meant  By  good ease pleasure  or  content  Good  might we variously explain  Ease  is deliv'rance but from pain  Pleasure  is actual joy confess'd  And mere  content  but patient rest  A neutral state at best and worst  But negatively blest or curst  That which our  happiness  we call  Tho' that nor this the sum of all  The world's plain meaning plainly this  Some constant state of actual bliss  No matter whether in degree  Alike bestow'd on you or me  Enough if void of fear or pain  No motive lead us to complain  Enough whate'er the mode of joy  If such that it can never cloy  Look round the world and tell me true  Where is such happiness in view  From monarchs fled as sings the bard  His patron's virtue to reward  Tell me in truth was  St John  blest  See essay on man Ep  Or did the bitter bard but jest  Dipping his pen in worse than gall  An outed statesman  bless'd  to call  With equal truth the muse might paint  My Lord of  Bolingbroke  a saint  Run riot o'er his dubious fame  And dub him with a patriot's name  So worthy of his country's prÃ ise  So meek so holy all his ways  Nor tho' to him to him alone  A state of perfect bliss unknown  Of each complexion age degree  Mankind as far remov'd as he  Go ask my friend from door to door  The high the low the rich the poor  In court or cot if here or there  Reside the mortal free from care  You ask in vain for joy and strife  Diversify all states of life  To wield the scythe with sweaty brow  With wearied arm to guide the plough  To sow in hope to reap in joy  Thine  labour  is the sweet employ  A life of rest with pain t'endure  To seek in health disease's cure  To eat the grape unprun'd the vine  Laborious  idleness  is thine  Yet idleness of care complains  And labour quarrels with its pains  Nor only found or made distress  Because externals fail to bless  Lodg'd in ourselves the taste and will  That make externals good or ill  No earthly blessing hence we find  An equal good to all mankind  Belmore  the sober'st thing on earth  Dreads the broad laugh and roar of mirth  While  Clerrio  with a length of chin  Protracted by perpetual grin  Tho'  Socrates  himself pass by  Must laugh in ridicule or die  How elegant how high refin'd  The palate of  Cardella  's mind  How low how vulgar  Cotta  's soul  That feels no rapture in a vole  See thousands as in love with strife  Pursue it fretting all their life  And darken with the clouds of spleen  The sky of providence serene  Wretched to find another eas'd  And most unhappy when they're pleas'd  How strange while some with patient toil  Raise comfort on a barren soil  Or pleasure strike by native dint  From cruel fortune's hardest flint  The patriarch like whose rod we're told  Earth's stubborn fetters burst of old  When gush'd the stream from  Horeb  's rock  To water  Israel  's thirsty flock  Hence not on earth a blessing sent  Gives universally content  For while so varied is our taste  Manna itself were show'r'd to waste  With reason therefore we profess  God meant not here our happiness  Else in the various blessings given  Sure various minds might find their heaven  If says Mr  Pope  To all men happiness was meant  God in externals could not place content  To me I must confess the various conditions of humanlife seem so admirably adapted to the several dispositions ofindividuals that if our happiness in this life were intended the unequal distribution of the gifts of fortune affords themost plausible means to effect it  But know as different we find  Each individual's turn of mind  As little with ourselves we see  Ourselves at various times agree  So oft our views our tempers change  As through life's varied scenes we range  At times so diff'rent from himself  The prodigal will hoard his pelf  Spend greedily the night at play  To throw next morn his gains away  At times ev'n misers rob their store  And give their sixpence to the poor  At times ev'n trembling cowards fight  And desp'rate put the bold to flight  While sick of fighting and of fame  The brave like  belgick  lions tame  How oft my friend in private life  We love the maid we hate a wife  How oft the scene that gives delight  At morn offends the eye at night  'Tis not the want of that or this  Possession is the bane of bliss  And hence of happiness we see  On earth th' impossibility  Yet with an interested view  Doth still  Lorenzo  truth pursue  Dost thou suppose th'enlighten'd mind  In truth's researches bliss may find  That science fancy may restrain  And fix that weathercock the brain  Alas deceive thy self no more  But give thy vain pretensions o'er  For as a world of fruitless cost  In vain inquiries hath been lost  A world of labour spent t'attain  To knowledge man may never gain  So millions all their lives have spent  Searching for bliss in discontent  For bliss which but a little thought  Had told them never could be taught  Yet still they ask yet still they run  A race that never can be won  Thus sought of yore projecting fools  The  summum bonum  of the schools  And wiser heads than those of old  The stone converting all to gold  Or vain adepts much wiser still  To wrest from nature's hand at will  Promethean theft celestial fire  To animate their wood and wire  Madmen that not  Monro  could cure  Of circles and their quadrature  Of thinking drunken nature reels  Like a slung coach on springs and wheels  Dost thou instructed in thy youth  To place consummate bliss in  truth  Conceive it somewhere hidden lies  Among the learned and the wise  That hence our bliss or misery flow  The truth to know or not to know  In vain the learn'd in science deep  In search of  bliss  their vigils keep  In vain the universe explore  Swift as their search it flies before  Through ev'ry clime on ev'ry wind  And leaves the panting wish behind  O tell me what connection ties  So close the happy and the wise  Did e'er the sage in wisdom find  The artless infant's peace of mind  Proud knowledge e'er or boastful art  Restore to joy the broken heart  Ah what avails the truth to know  When  truth's  the frequent source of woe  While gilded  fiction's  dazzling rays  With sunshine beautify our days  Or mildly shed its silver beams  Reflected light our nightly dreams  While pleasure and its laughing train  Dance by the moonshine of the brain  For what is knowledge but to know  How ignorant our state below  The more we learn the more to find  Beyond our learning still behind  Our fruitless wishes to increase  Whene'er our mental prospects cease  So far from happiness my friend  Is science in its means or end  Sayst thou that bliss the world affect  The smile of God on his elect  Confin'd to  Abr'am  's faithful seed  And made dependant on our creed  Go ask the saints to whom are given  The best assurances of Heaven  The few distinguish'd here on earth  As children of a spiritual birth  "How gloomy oft a state of grace  "How often hid their Maker's face  "How oft by satan and by sin  "Sore buffeted the man within"  These all confess beyond the sky  Their blissful heritage doth lie  Say is repos'd this Heav'nly trust  Within the bosom of the just  While virtue in itself you call  The happiness of one and all  Pretending still "tho' yours and mine  "No partial mode of bliss define  "Yet that our diff'rent tastes unite  "In meaning well and thinking right  "An universal moral this  "Conducting all mankind to bliss"  Alas what sophistry to tell  Of "thinking right and meaning well"  Pope  Unless this rectitude of thought  With perspicuity be taught  This honest meaning plainly shown  So oft admir'd so little known  At virtue if we're left to guess  What is't to say 'tis happiness  The way to  virtue  as to bliss  If dubious  that  as doubtful  this  How fruitless therefore but to know  "Virtue is happiness below"  Sayst thou mankind are all agreed  That happiness is virtue's meed  The service of the work inquire  And by the labour rate the hire  Now virtue some to  fact  confine  While others place it in  design  These  blest but for the good they  do  And  those  for all they  have in view  But if by virtue understood  The mere intent of doing good  Those fully virtuous may be held  Who ne'er one lawless passion quell'd  Whom ne'er temptation led astray  Beyond the tenour of their way  A sober path by stoicks trod  Nor friends to man nor foes to God  Consistent with a state of rest  If virtue's centred in the breast  As happy those may surely live  Who nothing give nor have to give  As those who taste in ey'ry sense  Th' exertion of benevolence  Some seeming diff'rence yet we find  What pangs affect the tender mind  What exquisite sensations rise  To hear the orphan's piteous cries  To feel the widow's piercing woe  When no relief our wants bestow  Doth virtue here rejoice the heart  As when the gen'rous ease impart  When purest transports warm the breast  That glows to succour the distress'd  And yet my friend 'twere wond'rous hard  If bliss the virtuous rich reward  In poverty that virtue's zeal  Should double all the pangs we feel  Each gen'rous sigh each social tear  But render want the more severe  To virtue therefore if the deed  Our best designs must yet succeed  Granting that happy ev'ry mind  In such proportion as its kind  Here in  externals  do we place  The happiness of human race  Enabled to relieve distress  As wealth or pow'r ourselves possess  For bliss capacitated more  As blest with fortune's worldly store  Fix'd by this scheme the blissful state  Exclusive to the rich and great  The virtuous poor but innocent  Claim at th' utmost bare content  Besides if individuals blest  As sharers only with the rest  True happiness with thee to call  Not merely that of  one  but  all  What is inactive virtue's use  Can it to social good conduce  Can it thus fruitless and confin'd  Be call'd a blessing to mankind  If then we judge so much amiss  Of virtue and of virtuous bliss  If faith tho' crown'd with alms and pray'rs  Hath all its pangs hath all its cares  While ev'n from knowledge prospects rise  That make us miserably wise  His perfect happiness to reach  No morals mortal man can teach  Still Heav'n's best vot'ries must confess  No blessings here compleatly bless  A compound strange of bliss and woe  Man's variable state below  Some absent something ours to crave  Ev'n from the cradle to the grave  How idly then employ'd the mind  In search of that we cannot find  For human bliss stands never still  Our good insep'rable from ill  Virtue says Mr  Pope  is the  Point where human bliss stands still  And tastes the good without the fall to ill  Whilst all of pain and pleasure share  Their hour of joy their hour of care  Adapted to each sev'ral state  Fix'd and determinate as fate  The world my friend an ample field  Of such examples store doth yield  How throbs the infant's little breast  Beneath a load of care oppress'd  The care that issues with a sigh  The tear yet standing in the eye  Or caught in laughter's dimple sleek  Dry'd up in stealing down the cheek  See next among the sachel'd crowd  Bold as a hero and as proud  The little tyrant of his class  How happy till condemn'd to parse  Or sob beneath the weightier curse  Of scanning  Lily  's crabbed verse  However puerile this example may seem there has been more than one instance of a schoolboy's having actually been guilty of suicide in order to avoid the discipline of the rod or the ferula  In youth how glows the vital fire  'Tween expectation and desire  Our sanguine hopes our awkard fears  All suiting unexperienc'd years  Still riper joys do manhood bless  When fullblown fortune we possess  We riot on the joyous store  Till health and strength can charm no more  When disappointment and chagrin  Retaliate all our joys with spleen  Proportion'd next to wasted age  Insipid joys and peevish rage  Tho' dim th' exhausted passions burn  Take to our latest gasp their turn  Thus relative my friend we find  The pains and pleasures of mankind  Adapted all in due degree  To human sensibility  For see no more alive to smart  Than dead to joy the hardofheart  As far from rapture as despair  The fretful family of care  Not sickness pain nor death itself  Avarus  dreads like loss of pelf  While  Lavish  offers an estate  To staunch a cut ere yet too late  Dispel the headach or remove  Th' effects of his intemp'rate love  Was ever

While such our varying state below  Ev'n joy degen'rates into woe  And pains in sufferance by degrees  On their own pangs engender ease  Their antidote like scorpions bring  T' expel the poison of

nerves the human lyre  While such in tune these sages say  The smiling hours in concert play  But if in change too lax or tense  Health strikes no more the keys of sense  But tremblingly alive all o'er  The tortur'd strings in discord roar  While sickness with her harpy claws  Stranger to each harmonious cause  Labours benumb'd the jarring strain  That stuns our ear with deaf'ning pain  Nor yet can health too oft repeat  Its musick howsoever sweet  While by degrees lo ev'ry string  Depriv'd of its elastick spring  In gen'ral lassitude full soon  The whole machine grows out of tune  Should

bliss is all our woe  Each holding intimately join'd  Alternate empire o'er the mind  Like  Persian  monarchs hardly known  Ere tumbled headlong from the throne  Precarious and as short its sway  Depos'd and sceptred in a day  Pleasure  begins its fickle reign  And tyrannizes into  pain  When as to cruel pain we bow  Its rod grows light we know not how  Ah cruel blow to human pride  Is pain and pleasure thus allied  That all the sweets of life grow sour  Within the transitory hour  Complains  Lorenzo  darts behind  No ray of comfort on his mind  If thus with varied joy and strife  Diversified all states of life  If human being cannot know  A constant state of bliss or woe  Worn by sharp mis'ry to the bones  While grief with intermission groans  And meagre want half fed the while  Grins forth her grateful ghastly smile  Tho' vain our hopes of bliss as vain  Our fears of unremitting pain  Absurd the mischiefmaking care  That leads us blindly to despair  EPISTLE THE SIXTH  ARGUMENT  On abstract good and evilThe physical perfection of the material universe and the moral harmony observable in the dispensations of Providience  SUMMARY  THE inquiries of philosophers into the abstract cause of evil have hitherto been attended with little success Indeed no such abstract evil exists For whatever calamities human life be subject to their  evil  depends merely on our own sensibility Even physical evils which are the least controvertible are evidently relative to their effects on the sufferings or enjoyments of mankind Whence they must not be accounted abstract evils or real defects in the general system of things of which we have at present but a  partial  view and therefore cannot tell how far apparent imperfections may conduce to the perfection of the  whole  That human life is subject nevertheless to palpable evils cannot be denied but it should be consider'd that as such evils are but temporary and are evil but in proportion to the pleasure or good by which they are contrasted we are not sensible of any abstracted evil unless a state of humanity on the whole be attended with a greater portion of pain than pleasure This is asserted by many but is experimentally false Indeed on a fair and impartial estimate our sufferings and enjoyments seem to stand on an equal ballance Hence also if there be no abstract physical evil in the universe there is as little reason for us to hold  the existence of physical good or to maintain that happiness is the privilege of human life That "whatever  is  is  right  " with respect to the whole is allow'd but that it is therefore  good  is another consideration  goodness  being a term relative to the happiness of mankind and not applicable to that general system The famous principle of  the BEST  is therefore futile and frivolousAs to  moral  good and evil we owe a sense of them purely to  physical  for had mankind felt neither pain nor pleasure they would never from the light of nature have acquir'd the ideas of moral good or ill Those actions therefore are morally good which give rise to more pleasure than pain and morally bad  vice versa  Innocence being strictly speaking neither good nor evil and indeed inconsistent with a state of  action  Moral evil appears hence to be also merely relative to  man  and can by no means be consider'd as a defect in the designs of Providence unless we can be so absurd as to suppose it in the power of created beings to counterwork the intentions of their supreme creator On the other hand moral good is equally relative and can have no effect on the happiness of the first cause or plead any abstract merit with the Deity Moral good and evil however in the agent is necessarily attended with temporary happiness and misery in the  distribution of which also agreeable to relative merit it is not improbable that impartial justice is done even in this life in the perfect dispensations of Providence Our hopes or apprehensions nevertheless of a future state are not hereby cut off On the contrary this life may only be preparatory to a future where the virtuous and vicious may be very differently dispos'd of in the scale of existence But whatever be our lot hereafter it rests on the good pleasure of our creator into whose hands philosophy calmly resigns the hidden concerns of futurity  EPISTLE THE  SIXTH  IS there who teach that human woe  Must from a source abstracted flow  Existing in creation's plan  Some active ill the curse of man  Some imperfection or offence  In physicks or in providence  The question old unanswer'd lies  "Whence did the curse of evil rise"  By  Wolfius  left and twenty more  As puzzling as 'twas left before  To God or devil still assign'd  The cause of ill by humankind  In disobedience to his God  Did

system all complain  Of blunders there confusion here  Too distant Heav'n and hell too near  In mood so splenetick my friend  Say what those evils that offend  Thy doubts propose thy questions ask  And take omnisciency to task  Giv'n thy sagacity offence  By all thou seest of providence  The constitution prone to blame  Of nature's universal frame  Dost thou Heav'n's boasted care deny  When tempests sweep along the sky  Thy feather'd geese when whirlwinds bear  Aloft and scatter wide in air  Or from the hills impetuous rains  Descend and strip th' autumnal plains  Concluding the machin'ry vile  When earthquakes shake our stable isle  When  Etna  and  Vesuvius  flame  To nature each a burning shame  Finds thy philosophy as soon  Faulty th' attraction of the moon  When death resistless roaring rides  In triumph o'er the swelling tides  Or bathing in destruction drowns  Flocks herds and men and helpless towns  Or bears them off some mountain steep  All headlong down to glut the deep  Or is thy wiser censure bent  Against some comet's dire event  In time to come time out of mind  To fall into the sun design'd  Suspicious that if planets turn  To comets ours at length may burn  And we be doom'd some sultry day  To his devouring flames a prey  Lorenzo  is this strain admir'd  Here mayst thou rail till sense be tir'd  But judge not thou as sophists vain  Of gen'ral good by partial gain  Thinking when cross'd our stubborn will  Such is a providential ill  For know no abstract cause exists  And battles in creation's lists  A formal enemy to man  Since nature's tournaments began  Inflam'd with enmity and power  God's human likeness to devour  No'tis impossible a cause  Should counteract creation's laws  The hand of providence arrest  Or IIcav'n's determin'd pow'r contest  As one or other must prevail  And one or both together fail  But nature knows no real strife  However jarring human life  From evil and from errour free  These only relative to thee  In icy chains let winter bind  The glebe untrod by humankind  Fierce light'nings flash and thunders roll  Their horrours only round the pole  Let  Malstrooms  roar and  Heclas  blaze  Where fools nor cowards stand to gaze  Let islands drown let mountains melt  These are no evils till they're felt  'Mid southern seas and lands unknown  Should agonizing nature groan  There only ease her future th  oes  And harmless horrours round disclose  Earthquakes would lose their evil name  And Heav'n no longer bear the blame  Tho' evils now we loudly call  Lima  's and  Ulysippo  's  Lisbon  so called from its suppos'd founder  Ulysses  fall  Lorenzo  of creation's plan  But parts are visible to man  Whence ign'rant of their sep'rate use  We think them subject to abuse  Tho' all with art consummate join  Conducive to Heav'n's main design  As parts to complex engines prove  Inspir'd by mechanism to move  This retrograde and that direct  In diff'rent modes to one effect  So howsoe'er they clash to sense  The sev'ral springs of providence  In concert at their Maker's will  Their ends harmoniously fulfil  Upheld the weight let fall the rod  As urges the first mover God  How blind are then the smatt'ring fools  Just taught their geometrick rules  The simple use of rule and line  To these who nature would confine  Its laws who else capricious call  Or say "it acts by none at all  "The macrocosm's vast engine made  "By one that knew not half his trade  "Its bungling engineer at hand  "To help it forward at a stand"  Impious like  Marli  's doth it take  The pains to mend it did to make  Requiring endless cost and care  To hold in tenable repair  Ah no howe'er to us it seem  Creation is a perfect scheme  Lorenzo  let not words deceive  All imperfection's relative  Since from conceiv'd amendments came  The patchwork we perfection name  A term for something understood  Productive still of mortals' good  But of perfection absolute  All nature is beyond dispute  For all from God is here deriv'd  And all is perfect God contriv'd  "Man surely perfect then" you cry  As man most perfect I reply  The creature of his Maker's will  Form'd his good pleasure to fulfill  Destin'd in th' universal plan  To fill his space and act as  man  What tho' on earth the human mind  Involv'd in ignorance we find  Impassion'd fickle giv'n to pride  Nor resting e'er selfsatisfied  Doth pow'r comparative t'improve  Perfection positive remove  As well imperfect might we say  The rising sun at early day  Since with superior heat and light  It blazes in meridian height  Form'd with progressive pow'rs to rise  From out the dust to tread the skies  Perfect as such humanity  However lowly in degree  How ignorant and weak are those  Who nature's authour then suppose  In providence remains a spy  To guard his work with watchful eye  From fallen angels' base intent  The direful outrage to prevent  To rescue or preserve his plan  From that prodigious creature man  Like the young steed that scours the plain  Its nature wild and needs a rein  Or halts it like a founder'd jade  Lame by her frequent stumbling made  Perhaps  Lorenzo  some mistake  Concerning  providence  we make  The pow'rs of nature to divide  From its imaginary guide  For if creation has in fact  Been long ago a finish'd act  What end doth lab'ring time pursue  Or what hath providence in view  For sure thou wilt not take the side  Of those whose ignorance and pride  Maintain the universe design'd  Merely to gratify mankind  A stage as on a stroler's cart  Where drolls itin'rant play their part  In grinning mirth or brawling strife  The tragicomedy of life  Was then heav'n's wond'rous pow'r display'd  This system in perfection made  Only to wear itself away  Stupendous frame for mere decay  Its worlds to wander through the void  Destroying till themselves destroy'd  Or in some future fabled days  To take imaginary blaze  At flames that all to ruin turn  Annihilating as they burn  Risk'd then the censure of my wit  I hold the world unfinish'd yet  Time building what Heav'n's wisdom plann'd  Creation's work ev'n yet in hand  Through nature's scenes in order range  See all things in continual change  All to some point progressive run  To do as well as be undone  Existing for so short a space  Thousands we know but by their place  Which chang'd by changing form we say  The things themselves are pass'd away  No proofs of  being  objects bring  Whose  essence  ever on the wing  Flown from their  forms  ere yet defin'd  Leaves no identity behind  But waving this yet see we here  No abstract cause of ill to fear  Since on the feelings of mankind  Depends the ev'ry ill we find  Whence tho' our suff'rings ill we call  They're no abstracted cause at all  For stript creation of mankind  No evil would be left behind  To this will cavillers reply  "We ask not where those causes lie  "If in  externals  be th'offence  "Or in the  pravity  of  sense  "That real ill exists is plain  "While man is sensible of  pain"  In answer my  Lorenzo  here  No vaunting stoicism fear  Nor think thy friend so madly wise  T'affect his mis'ries to despise  I ne'er presume that point to teach  Nor 'gainst the voice of nature preach  None feel more tenderly than I  Mine the soft heart and wat'ry eye  The sanguine hopes the groundless fears  Still unsubdued by sense or years  Ah too susceptible of pain  When vice or folly but complain  Yet ev'n while tears of anguish flow  I hold no abstract ill we know  'Tis true my friend no man alive  Could in his senses gravely strive  The wretch in torture to persuade  Of evil not to be afraid  The murd'rer mangled on the wheel  To smile at harmless rope and steel  Or that the blows that loitering kill  Cannot be physically ill  Absurd the argument and vain  Since all we know of  ill  is  pain  And yet as neither griev'd nor pain'd  Of evil man had ne'er complain'd  If relative our bliss and woe  Reciprocally ebb and flow  'Tis palpable that joy and strife  Are but the modes of human life  Which varied with consummate skill  Proves on the whole nor good nor ill  Sayst thou the learned are agreed  The ills of life the good exceed  Lorenzo  peevish sick or vain  How nat'ral is it to complain  But sure experience here denies  This threadbare maxim of the wife  Behold the weak the blind the lame  The sons of poverty and shame  The wretch expiring by degrees  By amputations or disease  Such whose vile lot the world their foe  Contempt and beggary below  Shouldst thou to this or that propose  In death a cure for all their woes  Tell 'em "oppress'd with human strife  "Wide stand the num'rous doors of life  "With open arms the wretch to save  "Rest welcomes mis'ry to the grave"  How few your recipÃ© will try  Tho' dying piecemeal loth to dye  Nor merely from the fear of  worse  Tenacious of a  present  curse  For say annihilation here  The all poor mortals have to fear  How few would yet their ills incline  Their sense of being to resign  To part on terms like these with pain  With pleasure ne'er to meet again  Ev'n nature shudd'ring at the thought  To sink inconscious into naught  In mere existence sure mankind  Must then intrinsick pleasure find  Some good equivalent must feel  To such suppos'd excess of ill  Since thus by death so loth to part  An aching head and bleeding heart  May not at least all human woe  Be ballanc'd with our joys below  Dost thou  Lorenzo  doubt of this  How dost thou measure earthly bliss  'Tis not by extasy alone  Thy actual share of joy is known  Duration  adds to the degree  As much as its  intensity  Joy for a moment's space how small  Pain instantaneous none at all  Through life continued little less  Ev'n bare  content  than happiness  The joyous extasy of bliss  Dilating rarified to this  Be it on individuals tried  Each needs but to be satisfied  The longing wish the sigh is o'er  When once content we ask no more  Thus equal joy we often taste  In shortliv'd pleasures snatch'd in haste  As others or when raptur'd less  For years ev'n we ourselves possess  Hence oft asserted in dispute  That time ideas constitute  Sense of duration so confin'd  To that which passes in the mind  Th'expectant lover thinks in rage  His  Stellia's  absent hour an age  While short and sweet the moments fly  When love and she sit smiling by  Nor giv'n their epithets in vain  To fleeting joy and lingering pain  In minutes flown each joyful day  Each sad one whiled in hours away  Nay tho' of life tenacious all  Longevity no bliss we call  In diff'rent animals at least  While ev'n the less the greater's feast  'Tis probable their joys and strife  Are suited to their term of life  Whence equal pleasure equal pain  May longliv'd elephants sustain  With young ephemerons whose flight  At noon beginning ends at night  During which momentary space  They rise love battle and embrace  Flutt'ring around till out of breath  They drop into the arms of death  From selfexperience dost thou rate  The real hardship of thy fate  Art thou with ev'ry friend at strife  Seest thou no gentle joy in life  Dost thou no fav'rite scheme possess  To build contemplative success  Hast thou no hope no good dost choose  A good thou wouldst not die to lose  Thy day thus clouded at the dawn  Will brighter shine its clouds withdrawn  Or is thy morn of sunshine past  With clouds thy ev'ning's overcast  Wouldst of its brightness know th'amount  Bring morn and ev'ning to account  Stands nature then so long abus'd  Of abstract evil thus excus'd  As little truth is understood  By those who hold all nature  good  "Whatever is is right" it may  But therefore  good  we cannot say  Unless some perfect bliss we see  Arise from partial misery  In spite of truth in reason's spite  When vex'd or pain'd we all deny't  Ne'er till the pain be o'er confessing  That  was  which never  is  a blessing  The term's then here misunderstood  Right's  not equivocal to  good  Goodness  adapted and confin'd  To th' appetites of humankind  The  right  unknown to you or me  Tho' sure what  is  is fit to  be  Let  Plato  then or  Leibnitz  prate  Of goodness influencing fate  Or idle sophisters contest  Their boasted principle  the best  By disputants on either side  The partial term is misapplied  But should we even suppose the term to be us'd with propriety in this case it remains to be prov'd that two different systems cannot be equally good before we subscribe to the doctrine of  Leibnitz  or  Plato viz  that out of an infinite variety of possible worlds God hath chosen or could not but choose the  best  That God is good they know full well  But what his goodness none can tell  Unless to man his kindness shown  Heav'n's good depends upon our own  Lorenzo  merely to mankind  Thus evil  physical  confin'd  Of  moral  next a puzzling task  An explanation dost thou ask  Sayst thou "Heav'n's care no more extends  "To physical than moral ends  "The same the providential power  "That rains the soft refreshing shower  "That in the womb of teeming earth  "Its atoms quickens into birth  "Doth in the moral scene connect  "The cause and consequent effect  "On virtue peace of heart bestows  "Softens the good man's casual woes  "Abandons vice to fell despair  "Or plagues with heartcorroding care"  Concluding hence "that moral ill  "Opposing nature's righteous will  "Aloud for Heav'n's dread vengeance calls  "The curse that on the guilty falls"  So far  Lorenzo  I with thee  In part most readily agree  That vice will leave a sting behind  And virtue its reward shall find  Yet all with good  St Paul  confess  "Without a law we can't transgress"  Now nature's law is Heav'n's command  Whose will no mortal can withstand  How lives earth's animated clod  To contravene the will of God  As well advent'rous of his neck  The laws of gravity to break  Presumptuous man might seek to fly  A creeping earthworm to the sky  Or don the  bishop's  winged shoon  To trip it yarely to the moon  Bishop  Wilkins  conceiv'd a possibility of our flying up to the moon and that it would in time become as common for a traveller to call for his wings as it was for his cotemporaries to call for their boots  What curse soe'er then vice provoke  Creation's laws can ne'er be broke  But know by  physical  alone  Is  moral  good or evil known  For had not vice the pow'r to vex  Its evil never would perplex  Each moral thus a partial ill  Permitted by th'eternal will  To mortals relative th'offence  And punishments of providence  Lorenzo  state the matter clear  Be pain and pleasure strangers here  Strangers to pleasure and to pain  Induce what motives to complain  Suppose we then in nature's plan  T'exist th'automaton of man  Rising from senseless matter's arms  Where perfect rest nor grieves nor charms  Should Heav'n a consciousness bestow  Subject to good or ill below  Not real pain or pleasure give  But only make the form to live  As yet from all reflection clear  Unnerv'd by hope unaw'd by fear  Suppose to action thus consign'd  This naked unaffected mind  Lorenzo  with precision hence  Let us infer the consequence  Ere yet existed moral ill  The first sole agent Was the  will  Reason without the pow'r to act  To censure or advise a fact  As from experience naught it knew  Of good or bad or false or true  For reason its conclusion draws  From similar effect and cause  No instinct faculty or sense  Insuring actual innocence  That bids us virtue's steps pursue  Or points to bliss it never knew  Else giving reason here had Heaven  No less than actual pleasure given  This not suppos'dhence reason's use  Some known effect must introduce  Now as innate if we maintain  A love of bliss and hate of pain  Directed as the passions fir'd  The will to pleasure first aspir'd  The moral agent bound to chuse  From pleasure's most immediate views  But prone to censure and complain  Suppose our first sensation pain  Let pain or pleasure be attain'd  Of both an equal sense was gain'd  As the first tree of knowledge bore  Of good and evil equal store  For when the mind one pleasure knew  Its neutral state of  rest  withdrew  Pleasure and pain by contrast known  Criteria of each other grown  Hence felt th'initiated mind  The sting which pleasure left behind  And reason did to act commence  On th'information of the sense  Seeing the passions ebb and flow  Now swoln with bliss now sunk in woe  Trac'd out the bounds extremes between  Of innocence that golden  mean  But ah the fluctuating tide  Of passion doth this  mean  deride  Consistent only 'tis confess'd  With nature in a state of  rest  Here then from moral  action  came  The necessary ill we blame  Running selflove in full career  Reason her guide not always near  Her satisfaction oft pursuing  Tho' at her own and others' ruin  Pronounce we hence a moral ill  Th'indulgence of the human will  Whene'er from such indulgence flows  More pain than pleasure it bestows  In guilt original involv'd  Here see the wond'rous myst'ry solv'd  To the first man no more confin'd  Than passions found in ev'ry mind  Is the plain cause of moral woe  Sin human frailty here below  Lorenzo  evil understood  The die's reverse is moral good  Whate'er more pleasure yields than pain  Not indeed solely to the agent but to mankind or the moral world in general  The name of goodness doth obtain  Unsatisfied  Lorenzo  yet  Dost thou lost happiness regret  Doth from our plan of morals seem  Yet providence no perfect scheme  Because perplex'd with fear or pain  Ev'n virtue covets bliss in vain  Dost thou against the cause object  "'Tis disproportion'd to th' effect  "Thus in th'intemp'rance of the will  "To place the source of moral ill  "Our passions but a nat'ral cause  "Obedient to creation's laws  "Here palpably too innocent  "The cause of mis'ry to be meant"  Must I repeat it o'er again  From pleasure flows our sense of pain  Through life each other's contrast made  Dependant these as light and shade  Whence tho' to moderation join'd  Content's serenity of mind  While vice but sports with higher glee  To sink as low in misery  Proportion'd to the guilty joy  The pangs intemperance annoy  Yet on the whole no abstract ill  Doth here confront th'eternal will  Of evil all th'effected strife  But relative to human life  Sayst thou indeed "if man confin'd  "To fill the place by Heav'n assign'd  "But partially to rise or fall  "Why feels he misery at all"  Another question answers this  What title have mankind to bliss  During thy life if man and boy  Thy share of both thou mayst enjoy  If perfect rest the certain mean  Our pleasures and our pains between  Null'd  the  momentum  of our pain  Who shall of providence complain  Seest thou incumbering the ground  The barren figtrees flourish round  While virtue stands the brunt of vice  And knaves possess fools' paradise  'Tis here indeed our errour lies  Our virtue we too highly prize  And adequate rewards to find  Create them fondly to our mind  Not satisfied on Heav'n to trust  Or think its dispensations just  Unless his conduct God submit  To our investigating wit  Here toiling as an humble drudge  For man his critick lord and judge  What merit in thy Maker's eye  That thou vain man art six foot high  To Heav'n must all with shame agree  Unprofitable servants we  Unworthy of celestial dress  The rags of human righteousness  The all that virtue has to boast  Claiming the world's regard at most  As virtue here so vice depends  Ourselves our guilt alone offends  For know proud man no act of thine  Renders defective God's design  No pow'r to human frailty given  To injure unpreventing Heaven  Presume not at so high a price  To rate th' iniquity of vice  Nor let the vainlyvirtuous fool  Projecting Heav'n by line and rule  Sore lash'd and wasting to the bone  The crimes of health and ease t'atone  Conceive by want of rest and meat  Th' eternal purpose to defeat  Presume not at so vile a rate  To hold th' omnipotence of fate  Yet who shall say that guilt is free  Or promise vice impunity  Since 'tis so plain the sting of woe  To joy inordinate doth grow  And none from virtue's paths would stray  If pleasure did not lead the way  Can virtue also hence despair  Since virtue's providence's care  Compensing pleasure due to pain  And this nor that bestow'd in vain  Let fools when hard their present lot  Think distant Heav'n has earth forgot  In discontent aloud complain  "That all our trust in Heav'n is vain"  Pretending God the world protects  And yet its sev'ral parts neglects  Do thou  Lorenzo  better taught  Never indulge so wild a thought  Conceiving th' individual man  No charge on nature's gen'ral plan  What tho' impossible that we  At once the whole and parts should see  To single objects here confin'd  Each fix'd attention of the mind  Yet shall we blasphemously join  Heav'n's intellect with yours and mine  Know thou the world's great architect  Its smallest part shall not neglect  As needful in the stately pile  As golden roofs th' abutments vile  Nor in their kind more perfect they  The parian stones than potter's clay  How sadly blund'ring in the dark  Here  St John  miss'd his boasted mark  When Heav'n's omnipotence t'enhance  He almost gave the world to  chance  Supposing God too great to mind  The peccadillos of mankind  Too insignificant our claim  To deity's immediate aim  Or rather from his reasons given  He thought the task too great for Heaven  Too puzzling for th' eternal wit  To hold its state and thus submit  Wherefore like th'idiot at a loss  To count Heav'n takes us in the gross  Lorenzo  probable the scheme  However strange the doctrine seem  Whate'er the next world give in this  That virtue hath its share of blifs  While all accounts 'tween vice and woe  Are settled and discharg'd below  No ballance to receive or pay  Left shuffling for a future day  Go make an estimate of life  Compare the sums of joy and strife  Each in its separate degree  Duration and intensity  Perhaps upon the whole you'll find  That neither's due to humankind  Nor loss nor profit in the trade  Of life's commercial

in the  God  EPISTLE THE  SEVENTH  ARGUMENT  On moral principlesThe respective influence of  reason  and the  passions  The immorality of  ignorance  and the indispensable duty of seeking  knowledge  SUMMARY  THE doctrine by which virtue and vice are confessedly limited to this life will doubtless excite the clamour of those who pride themselves or ground their expectations of future happiness on their own merit It may also be ask'd "To what purpose is it that mankind should pursue virtue rather than vice if all our pains and pleasures depend reciprocally on each other and our bad deeds neither actually offend nor our good ones have any real merit with the Deity" It is answer'd that as the merits and demerits of virtue and vice are partial and relative so also must be conceiv'd their respective rewards and punishments So that whatever distinction may be made between the virtuous and vicious in a future state it must be purely owing to the good pleasure of our creator and not to the influence of our merit over his final determinations It must not be conceiv'd however that this doctrine countenances immorality On the contrary it proves that as we are led to vice solely by the motives of pleasure apparently attending the gratification of our desires were a conviction always present to the mind that such pleasure must necessarily be attended with an equal degree of pain such conviction might prove an antidote to vice and preserve us at least in innocence the motive to action being thereby remov'd As to actual virtue indecd it is not pretended that any rational  conviction whatever is of itse'f a sufficient motive to virtue the use of reason being only to determine what is true or false just or unjust and not to excite us to embrace either This is the business of the  passions  which are however in themselves neither good nor evil those dispositions of mind which are generally term'd virtuous being the frequent occasion of our falling into vices which opposite ones tho' generally disapprov'd or detested would have secur'd us from Thus compassion benevolence and candour are the fertile sources of vice while hardnessofheart selfishness and distrust are as frequently the means of preserving innocence Nay the fierce harden'd and turbulent passions enter sometimes into the most virtuous characters and a heart unaffccted by the present suff'rings of humanity is not unfrequently necessary to preserve the rights and liberties of mankind In fact we are much deceiv'd in the motives as well as in the practice of virtue it being not only necessary that we should mean to do good and take the best way our reason may direct us to effect it but that we should previously take those measures which are in our power to acquire the knowledge of the means of doing such good Wilful ignorance is declar'd therefore intentionally vicious not having tho' innocent in fact the least claim to merit to which ev'n virtue itself hath but relative pretensions Indeed as physical good in the consequence is the measure of moral good in the  action  the very appearance of  merit  in the  agent  in a great degree vanistes our power of doing good depending  frequently on accident and not very seldom on downright knavery On all which considerations knowledge is laid dow  as a fundamental and indispensible moral principle and hence the employment of our leisure hours in inquiries after tru  is presum'd to be not merely entertaining but morally virtuous  EPISTLE THE  SEVENTH  HARK my  Lorenzo  how they rage  The pious of our pious age  Those who think Heav'n an

immoral pertly ask  What profits rise from virtue's task  Or wherefore vice we should eschew  If what the muse hath sung be true  That "vice and virtue bliss and woe  "Quit scores effectually below  "While unaffected Heav'n surveys  "Its ends fulfill'd in human ways"  Say they "if pain give pleasure birth  "To joy proportion'd grief on earth  "Our suff'rings all comparative  "What matters how th'

half of beauty's form compleat  But ah the contrast side appears  Worn out with care and gray with years  With wrinkled brow and squinting eye  Scowling most haggardly awry  While hollow cheek and nostril maim'd  Notch'd ear burnt hand and thighbone lam'd  Display a wretch from head to tail  Diseas'd with many a desp'rate ail  A form which wrapt in squalid dress  Compleats the half of ugliness  Behold the charmerthis is  Vice  Embrace her Is thy stomach nice  Too often  passion  single ey'd  Enamour'd with the fairer side  The monster clasps till turn'd her face  We starting fly her loath'd embrace  Through reason's medium only shown  Her real form in tints her own  Which thus disgusting to the sense  Could ne'er beguile our innocence  Should virtue then disown the muse  At least let innocence excuse  The strictest moralists content  If mortals were but innocent  In actual virtue true indeed  I see no hopes we should succeed  If once by reason grown so tame  That naught our passions could inflame  For say desires may not extrude  A sense of moral rectitude  This only points to what is right  But ne'er to virtue can excite  Reason indiff'rent to th' event  Merely bestows its cold assent  As far as truth's concern'd in part  Speaks to the head but not the heart  Reason bestow'd an humble friend  Not to keep faultless but to mend  With hopes to cheer or fears to bind  Selflove a glutton deaf and blind  To give our scene of action light  To check the sensual appetite  To show us what is good and fair  And passion's blunders to repair  To virtue sense of right and wrong  Must of necessity belong  But from this knowledge who infer  The conscious party cannot err  Nay founded on such sense our claim  To bear of vice the moral blame  The fool the mad do what they will  Standing excus'd of moral ill  Say then the virtuous must be wise  Yet not in wisdom virtue lies  By other motives must the mind  To virtuous action be inclin'd  "What other motive" dost thou ask  Lorenzo  difficult the task  T'unravel here the human mind  Its moral principles to find  Sayst thou we all true virtue love  And virtue that which all approve  Supposing this yet is't with you  That very approbation too  Is this  Lorenzo  what is meant  By virtue sprung from  sentiment  See  Hume  on the general principles of morals  By that ambiguous term of art  The native  goodness of the heart  Pride not yourselves ye  Pharisees  That acts of kindness give you ease  Nor think ye  publicans  from Heaven  An evil inclination given  Know that from diff'rent passions vice  And virtue take not sep'rate rise  For tho' deducing moral ill  But from th' indulgence of the will  No passion not the love of pelf  Is really vicious in itself  The noblest in the human breast  Motives to action but confess'd  Howe'er admir'd howe'er approv'd  From actual virtue far remov'd  For a  good heart  as put to use  Or vice or virtue may produce  A fertile soil where taking root  Plants good and bad bear equal fruit  Narcissa  boasted once a mind  The purest sure of human kind  Till growing passions taught her breast  To feel for all that seem'd distress'd  To melt in tenderness of grief  And sigh to give unask'd relief  Ah since by cruel arts betray'd  How low is fall'n the hapless maid  Too innocent to feel distrust  Or know how diff'rent love and lust  Now by her tempter ev'n accus'd  See her abandon'd and abus'd  Her open heart her gen'rous mind  To prostitution how resign'd  Of vices glorying in the shame  Her former self had blush'd to name  Alas for pity sec meanwhile  At lost  Narcissa  's ruin smile  Gremia  to pity never mov'd  As little loving as belov'd  In spite of all  vile man  could say  In pious maidenhood grown gray  Blessing her better stars that she  Still triumphs in her chastity  Tho' with the planets on her side  Illnature ugliness and pride  See  Phormio  stoically cold  In youth by constitution old  Who never yet his heart of stone  Once made another's cause his own  But living for himself or heirs  Minds nothing but his own affairs  Whose word not unbelieving Jews  For more than Heav'n is worth refuse  His credit sacred east and west  His bills negotiating best  Safe in whose hands were many a pound  Too good a man to run aground  O worthy honest man we cry  While bankrupt knaves in dungeons lie  So vile the rogue who scorning pelf  Lov'd others better than himself  Thus oft th'inflexible the just  The man that never broke his trust  Indebted to inhuman art  Or killing coldness in his heart  While base and mean the quickofsense  From glowings of benevolence  Lorenzo  feelingly I speak  Of failings where myself am weak  To whom adversity severe  Hath sold experience much too dear  Hard hearted  prudence  far from me  And narrowsoul'd  economy  To knave and fool too oft a prey  No match for either in his way  Till cheated plunder'd fill'd with shame  Lit on my luckless head the blame  How short  Lorenzo  plainly hence  Of virtue is benevolence  To mere  good nature  while you live  No more that pompous title give  The milk of kindness in a trice  Yielding the luscious cream of vice  The  milk of human kindness  hath been not unfrequently us'd as a florid term for benevolence See  Fielding  and others  The dryest eye the hardest heart  May act as virtuous a part  When turn'd as adders deaf the ear  From all that others feel or fear  Thence vicious  sloth  a whining cheat  Is forc'd to work before it eat  Misfortune  struggling in its thrall  Rises more glorious from its fall  Should to the prodigal the friend  On whom his spendthrift hopes depend  When ask'd assistance or advice  Reply with looks as cold as ice  With all the insolence of ease  "Nay friend for me do what you please"  May this not teach the hand profuse  Virtuous discretion's sov'reign use  And thus a coldness of the heart  A good to too much warmth impart  How much less vicious oft the mind  That ne'er beneficent or kind  For others broke one moment's rest  Nor cheer'd with comfort the distress'd  Than he whose open hand and heart  Espouse the poor and needy's part  Plunging in unforeseen distress  Hundreds in striving one to bless  Shortsighted oft benevolence  Proves a sad breach of innocence  To virtue requisite that first  The virtuous mind be strictly just  Passions the springs of joy and strife  Are but the elements of life  And as the streams from mountains flow  Smooth winding some through vales below  While others raging as they come  Tear up their mothermountain's womb  Or pouring down the hills amain  Deluge at once the humble plain  So some of these are gently mild  While others furious bold and wild  Foaming o'er reason's rockbuilt mounds  Disdain the check of moral bounds  But see in pastures streams of use  When art corrects the flood's abuse  When their due channels taught to keep  In shallow brook or river deep  Smiling through dappled meads they go  And paint the flow'rs they cause to grow  Corrected thus by reason's art  The bursts or meltings of the heart  In  virtue  's channels see them glide  Her flow'rs the blooming margin's pride  Is the small spring thy fav'rite theme  That trickles forth a shallow stream  In murmurs soft a purling rill  What wilt thou do to drive the mill  How wilt thou make to ride at large  Thy timber or thy loaded barge  As much as purling rills admir'd  The navigable stream requir'd  The stream whose turbulence abides  The roaring of the swelling tides  Alike whose raging bosom swells  And back the threat'ning tide repels  The hero thus the hardy brave  It should seem that Mr  Pope  suppos'd  heroism  incompatible with  virtue  from the following lines in his  essay on man  Heroes are much the same the point's agreed  From  Macedonia  's madman to the  Swede  The whole strange purpose of their lives to find  Or make an enemy of all mankind  I will grant that many heroick actions have been atchiev'd which have given just room for those who have no tincture of heroism in themselves to suppose the hero to be without either head or heart But however reprehensible the conduct of heroes may have been in general history may inform us that many of the distinguishing blessings mankind enjoy have been effected by those whom narrowminded moralists have stigmatiz'd as rogues and madmen  How needful half the world to save  Like  Prussia  's king through seas of blood  Wading for threaten'd  Europe  's good  Virtuously useful to mankind  The strongest as the weakest mind  Thus one no better than the other  The warmest heart's the cold one's brother  And neither this nor that in fact  Are virtuous till as such they act  Yet here appearances believ'd  In virtuous actions oft deceiv'd  How plain in th'hypocritick face  We read the characters of grace  And falsely to youth's giddy tribe  Designing villainy ascribe  While time and circumstance and place  Our byass'd judgments here disgrace  Is there a man whose tender heart  Takes in another's pains a part  Who clothes the naked feeds the poor  And bribes the orphan to his door  So kind he cannot bear to see  Another less at ease than he  Godlike benevolence you cry  And praise his  virtue  to the sky  But were this virtuous mortal poor  Oblig'd to beg from door to door  Could he not eat the bread at rest  Torn by the law from the distress'd  Should his weak mind compunction feel  In honest ways of trade to  steal  Could not the softness of his heart  Torture the horse that draws the cart  Mangle the lamb before it die  Or draw its heart's blood through its eye  Who would not cry "too proud to serve  "Work idle wretch or work or starve"  To  Bridewell  's lash the knave consign'd  For  vicious  tenderness of mind  Is there who worn with vice begins  To hide his multitude of sins  Leave of the wicked world doth take  And hermit turns for virtue's sake  Or anxious for the souls of men  Flies to the pulpit or the pen  Behold another  Paul  we cry  A new apostle from on high  Are there whom cares nor want exclude  At little cost from doing good  In pious practices that spend  Their fortune and their latter end  The sick who physick in distress  And make the trav'ler's burthen less  To these what virtue will refuse  The praiseful elegiack muse  But say doth tenderness of heart  Teach the  divine's  or  doctor's  art  Too oft unletter'd preachers rave  And damn the souls they meant to save  Too oft alas the pious pill  Of charity like  Ward  's doth kill  While lighten'd more the  pedlar's  pack  To clothe our own than save his back  "Whence then is virtue" dost thou cry  In truth and nature I reply  Reason and passion both combin'd  To form true virtue in the mind  Nor rests it there in mere design  To go where these may chance t' incline  'Tis not sufficient to set out  Tho' meaning well thy way in doubt  Needful experience here to use  That passion reason mayn't abuse  Cautious in virtue's route to go  No farther than such route we know  Lest when through ign'rance lost our way  Passion to vice should wildly stray  'Tis not enough to mean aright  Unless that meant effect's in sight  Too apt to wander from the mark  When blund'ring forward in the dark  A poor excuse to have it said  The heart had put it in the head  When mischief done instead of good  For want of being understood  To virtue pitiful our claim  When at a venture taking aim  More by good luck than sense or wit  The mark of moral good we hit  What virtue's in the madman's dream  Or fool's impracticable scheme  Whose should they ev'n succeed at best  Chancemedley morals are confess'd  Knowledge my friend goes hence 'tis plain  Foremost in virtue's splendid train  While reason and the passions join'd  Walk closely hand in hand behind  Is't said "one mere goodnatur'd deed  "All worth in science doth exceed"  One moral or a mere wellnatur'd deed  Can all desert in sciences exceed  Duke of Buckingham  On this weak maxim dost object  We virtuous merit here neglect  Thus honest ign'rance to contemn  And inability condemn  Sayst thou "  here  no foreknowledge given  Events are in the hands of Heaven  "And therefore virtuous those confess'd  "From what they know who act the best"  Lorenzo  nounless 'tis shown  That such no better might have known  'Tis true as individuals here  Are plac'd in each his proper sphere  Their knowledge more or less compleat  As genius and instruction meet  Man by no seraph's rapture fir'd  Virtue's as knowledge giv'n requir'd  But think not thou that bounteous Heav'n  Hath barren understanding given  Hath talents lent which unapplied  'Tis virtuous in the earth to hide  Nowith the pow'r of genius blest  Improvement's claim'd as interest  Is there who turns away his ear  Instruction's voice averse to hear  Most obstinately bent to plod  Along the road his father trod  Old custom never to forsake  Nor use of eye or ear to make  Tho' right the wilful wretch we find  Is his a virtuous turn of mind  With God above or man below  How is't deserving  not to know  Of virtue's merit folly hush  Nor put true wisdom to the blush  Remember virtue still depends  Both on our motives and our ends  What merit is't we gladly do  That which our hearts incline us to  Or what that reason doth submit  To own the truth is right and fit  For say that by the heart or head  Solely to virtue men were led  If by the heart and that alone  What man e'er call'd his heart his own  Right oft by impulse forc'd to go  Whether his reason leads or no  Apparently against the will  As oft conducting him to ill  How meritorious then the best  That love or pity warms the breast  For this nor that from vice can save  Or if they could'tis God that gave  Is it from caution practis'd long  You seek the right and shun the wrong  By just experience understood  How much your int'rest to be good  What merits here the clod of earth  That nature smil'd upon its birth  And gave it reason's fost'ring aid  To teach it virtue as its trade  Sayst thou "when head and heart we praise  "Doth this not virtue's merit raise  "The man of vicious acts asham'd"  May yet for spiritual pride be blam'd  "The elegantly just"too

future state is propos'd as the subject of inquiry A doctrine which however true or false in itself is both weakly attack'd and lamely supported by the philosophical arguments generally made use of for or against it Comparisons drawn from the  vegetable  creation however striking are partial and prove nothing  Moral  arguments prove as little unless we could first be made certain that vice and virtue are not duly punish'd and rewarded in this life or unless we could entertain adequate ideas of divine justice With these the metaphysical refinements concerning the soul's  immateriality  are shown to be equally inconclusive Our natural  desire of existence  is expos'd also as a weak argument for the justice of our claim to immortality On the other hand that  intimate connection  between body and mind and their apparent dependance on each other are shown to afford rather a specious plea in favour of the immortality of the soul than as frequently made to do any argument against itSetting however moral and metaphysical speculations aside man is consider'd merely in the light of an  animal  In which state of humiliation his pretensions to a future state are notwithstanding evidently justified on the plain and reasonable supposition that the Creator hath given to all animals such pow'rs and faculties as were necessary to the state of  being  appointed themNow the evident pursuits of other animals tend solely to the gratification' of  themselves or the mere preservation of their kind They have no intellectual system that extends beyond the life of the individual nor doth their experience serve to the improvement of their species With man it is otherwise The preservation and gratification of the individual however powerful their motives are in him made subservient to more general views his case health and life being constantly sacrific'd to pursuits that are of no use to him merely as an animal but on the contrary serve to promote the intellectual perfection of his species hence apparently intended for the enjoyment of a state of existence to which those faculties are adapted In the powers of imagination and genius may also be trac'd that faint image of the Deity in which man was confessedly made So that philosophy alone affords us sufficient reason to believe the certainty of a future state without our having recourse to contested authorities the chimerical suppositions of  errour  or the absurdities of  ignorance  EPISTLE THE  EIGHTH  O Blind to truth to science blind  The sceptick tribe of humankind  Who doubt  Lorenzo  if our lot  Be here to die and be forgot  Or if it prove our future fate  To know an intellectual state  In death to perish or to rise  Immortal to our native skies  By our being immortal is only meant that the soul doth not perish with the body we being strangers to any philosophical proof of its abstract or essential  immortality  Allur'd by wit to neither side  Be reason our impartial guide  Let us  Lorenzo  fairly weigh  What argument hath here to say  Hast thou poor  Dromio  's sophisms got  Who bids us vegetate and rot  Man but a rank and useless weed  Prove them alike and 'tis agreed  But the analogy of  parts  Is all that's prov'd by skeptick arts  Say that "of vegetable race  "We spread the root from place to place  "The lovely flow'r of beauty blows  "Twin sister to the province rose  "Allures at morn the gazing eye  "That ere the ev'ning sees it die"  Say "years disrobe the mantled brow  "As winter strips th' autumnal bough  "The rough rude blast to both unkind  "Both perish by an eastern wind  "Or by the axe untimely blow  "Are laid their spreading honours low"  Admit  Lorenzo  this be true  Go onthe parallel pursue  Say "the tall elms you stately row  "Sweet transports of sensation know  "When zephyrs kiss the lilly's breast  "The lilly's rapture be confess'd"  Say "the broad oak when thunders roar  "Fears till the thunderstorm be o'er  "Conscious of doubt and dread by turns  "Stands trembling as the forest burns  "Alive awake to nature's laws  "From nature's scenes experience draws  "Throbbing its trunk with hopes and fears  "Grown old in wisdom as in years  Is this absurd absurd indeed  Lorenzo  how unlike a weed  To moral arguments dost run  Here shall we end as we begun  Sayst thou "the virtuous when they die  "In their own right ascend the sky  "The wicked here unpunish'd go  "To torment in the world below  "Heav'n's justice else we should arraign  "And prove the virtuous good in vain"  You take my friend for granted here  What none by reason make appear  That vice at God almighty's hands  Eternal punishment demands  While endless bliss beyond the skies  Justice bestows as virtue's  prize  Justice  Lorenzo  what my friend  By  justice  dost thou here intend  Her sword she holds but say what ails  The equilibrium of her scales  How low the one tho' empty lies  To kick the beam while t'other flies  Alas I see by what compell'd  In diff'rent mediums are they held  One in  material  fluids buoy'd  The other in a perfect  void  Weigh'd in eternity and time  The punishment against the crime  Dare the selfrighteous tribe to say  That Heav'n's no more than virtue's pay  While vice demerits endless woe  Needs God a friend fears God a foe  Holding vindictive rage in store  For his own sake on man to pour  O nounhurt th'Almighty cause  Or kept or broken human laws  Cease then presumption to contend  That mortals Heav'n itself offend  Or at an  infinite  expence  Must answer a  finite  offence  To pay the fine immortal made  Which else unable to have paid  The dying wretch tho' tyrants cure  But tortures longer to endure  With nature cruelty at strife  When criminals are quit with life  Can God whose tender mercies flow  O'er all his varied works below  Whose loving kindness all confess  Whose name the distant nations bless  Say can this God of boundless love  Vengeful as earthly tyrants prove  O shame  Lorenzo  shame to all  Such cruelty that justice call  Such argument beside is vain  Unless the premises were plain  Unless we first could make it clear  That vice can ne'er be punish'd here  That virtue must be ever blest  For foll'wing but its interest  Or that we truly could define  That justice mortals call  divine  By  metaphysicks  dost thou strive  To keep the man in death alive  Wouldst thou set moral pleas aside  The body from the soul divide  Material  that  and born to die  While  this  a native of the sky  Objects that none can hear and see  Hence claiming immortality  But say is thy corporeal claim  Laid to the  matter  or the  frame  Is it the  substance  of the heart  Or  make  that is the mortal part  Doth change of form bring death alone  Form  we must  immaterial  own  If to the  essence  of the clay  Again mortality we lay  Doom'd the loath'd carcass to the worm  The  substance  changes but its  form  Through modes of being giv'n to range  Immortal in perpetual change  Maiter  by all the skeptick crowd  Essentially the same allow'd  In death in life our shame our pride  In various forms but modified  Say then the  matter  or the  frame  Or  both  in  body  have a claim  Nor mortal nor immortal we  From our  materiality  This argument might be carried much farther and the mere  potential  existence of matter prov'd to a demonstration but this would be perhaps too abstruse to enter into poetical composition  Lorenzo  doth thy bosom beat  To claim in heaven th'immortal seat  So fond of thy existence here  Dost thou annihilation fear  To fall as undistinguish'd clay  To dumb forgetfulness a prey  The joys of paradise in view  Sayst thou "thy claim must needs be true  "Else wherefore doth thy fond desire  "To immortality aspire"  See the famous soliloquy in  Addison  's CATO which may pass for logick on the  stage  and is perhaps goodenough  theatrical  reasoning but will hardly satisfy a philosopher in his closet unless indeed such a one as prefers the declamation of a  Plato  to the demonstrations of a  Newton  Whate'er in  hope  be Heav'n's intent  This is my friend no argument  I too perhaps so pleas'd to live  My very means of life might give  All I am worth from death to save  If hope were buried in the grave  But let  Lorenzo  never trust  To wish or hope however just  Nor let a passionate desire  To reason's sober task aspire  Wouldst thou false principles defend  Because they serve a pleasing end  Who loves the truth will sure despise  Her cause to rest on specious lies  What merit doth it add to worth  That knaves its virtues babble forth  What added weight or consequence  In suff'rage gives the fool to sense  Again is't said "so closely join'd  "In life the body and the mind  "Reciprocally form'd to bear  "Each other's weight of pain and care  "Sharing alike the mutual joy  "Which either wholly may destroy  "Since thus together both concur  "We know not either to prefer  "If both be purposely combin'd  "In use of  body  or of  mind"  Are there who weakly hence suppose  "The soul no sep'rate being knows  "But as the body doth decay  "So wears the mortal mind away"  Yet wherefore might not at our birth  Lodg'd in this tenement of earth  Lock'd up for life th'immortal mind  Its temporary prison find  Till paid our vital debt should be  And death should set the captive free  Meanwhile in hope in fear in doubt  Concerning friends and foes without  Prone through its prison grates to pry  It sees Time's scatter'd ruins lie  In darkness and confusion hurl'd  The embryo of another world  Why may not thus on earth be join'd  The body and the tenant mind  Th'inhabitant with cost and care  Keeping his mansion in repair  Us'd to the dungeon where he lies  And prone his present home to prize  Unknowing whither doom'd to roam  If once bereft of house and home  What wonder then for help he calls  When danger threats his tott'ring walls  Nor strange if heedless of their fate  They tumble on his wareless pate  Each other's mutual strength and ward  The mansion and the mansion's lord  What tho' we hold the soul to be  Attach'd to sensibility  Concludes  Lorenzo  rashly hence  The soul's as mortal as the sense  Alleging that "in life we find  "Perception to the organs join'd  "Poor mortals of sensation void  "As these are damag'd or destroy'd  "Therefore the soul on sense depends  "And with the failing organ ends"  Lorenzo  through a darken'd glass  Seest thou but faintly objects pass  More darken'd yet dost thou confess  Thy certainty of vision less  With its transparency thy sight  Decreasing till obstructed quite  Suppose it broke or let it fall  Dost think thou couldst not see at all  Ridiculous when objects lie  All open to the naked eye  Thus may the soul to body join'd  Be deaf irrational or blind  But take th'obstructing organs hence  At liberty its native sense  By fits no more it hears and sees  As now by piecemeal and degrees  In partial modes adapted here  To organs of the eye and ear  But intellect all ear all eye  It reads the wonders of the sky  At once what nature can disclose  Of scientifick secrets knows  Now sense and science both combin'd  In each perception of the mind  But here  Lorenzo  for a while  Lay by the metaphysick foil  With this behind our darken'd glass  Too apt to make a blund'ring pass  By much more anxious on the whole  To guard the  body  than the  soul  Too nice th' anatomizing art  To take them dextrously apart  Let us on both inquiry plan  And scrutinize their compound  man  Contented from his present state  To reason of his future fate  Doth  Dromio  say to hold dispute  "Man if no plant is yet a brute  "A helpless animal in birth  "His body form'd of kindred earth  "An animal in his decay  "His strength and vigour past away  "Equal the beast's sagacious pow'rs  "Or ev'n superior oft to ours"  The politick industrious bee  Dost own in wisdom rivals thee  Oeconomy secures from want  The careful and laborious ant  While man with all his boasted sense  Riots at health's and life's expence  Luxurious casts his cares aside  Or starves through indolence or pride  Here no preheminence his claim  Insects in life and death the same  Is there no medium in dispute  Must man be either God or brute  Must we with burning seraphs join  Or litter with the grov'ling swine  Content to bear the slight disgrace  Of mingling with the brutal race  Agreedfor once no longer proud  Be men mere animals allow'd  Say that more helpless at his birth  Than ev'n the vilest brute on earth  Man if denied the nurse's care  Might have run wild a human bear  Have beat the plains in search of food  Or sought his shelter in the wood  Devoid of language and of art  Apparent brute in head and heart  Yet still  Lorenzo  as we find  Some little difference in kind  Man as an animal is known  By marks peculiarly his own  Tho' both sharpsighted grave and fat  Melinda  and her tabby  cat  But a specifick diff'rence seen  'Twixt  Pug  and  Faddle  in the spleen  The wild the tame the great the small  Included in one genus all  We must not hence my friend infer  Melinda  's only born to purr  Nor that because alike in shape  Faddle  by nature's but an  ape  What if a monkey taught in  France  A modish minuet could dance  Or mischievous should play his tricks  Vers'd in  Parisian  politicks  Breaking thy china's brittle clay  Tho'

nature  and a  nat'ral state  The arts of social life despise  And think that brutes are only wise  Pretending better had it been  If kings and priests we ne'er had seen  If lawless ignorant and wild  Man had been left while yet a child  With brutes to share a common fate  More blest than in his present state  Go thou and act a social part  Man's nat'ral state's a state of art  The word  natural

et que nous les aurions presque tous Ã©vitÃ©s en conservant la maniÃ©re de vivre simple uniforme et solitaire qui nous Ã©toit  prescrite  par la nature Si elle nous a destinÃ©s a etre sains j'ose presque assurer que  l'etat de rÃ©flexion  est un  etat contre nature  et que  l'homme qui medite  est un  animal dÃ©pravÃ©  What use is here made of the word  nature  but I would ask if mankind ever were in this state of solitude how came it about they are united in a social one were they led to it by inclination or necessity If by inclination nature evidently prescribed it if by the necessities peculiar to their species a state of society was not only prescribed but enforced by nature Indeed whoever before doubted of man's being by nature a social animal    'Twas  nature  when the world was young  Unloos'd our first great grandsire's tongue  Taught his wild sons the force of speech  And gave the human pow'r to  teach  To social converse tun'd the ear  Gave mutual love and mutual fear  Inspir'd the hero warm'd the friend  And bade the strong the weak defend  'Twas  nature  gave  religion's  rule  And bade the wise conduct the fool  In justice gave the  law  to save  The weak and honest from the knave  'Twas  nature  rais'd our thoughts on high  In contemplation to the sky  Taught us to beat the wilds of space  And worlds on worlds in ether trace  Planets and suns unknown explore  And hence their maker God adore  All this you  artificial  call  I heed not empty terms at all  Call it by whatsoever name  'Tis  human nature  's special claim  Say from mere phrases to depart  How differs nature here form art  Within the solitary wood  Rears the old brock her helpless brood  For safety scouring to her den  At sight or sound of dogs and men  'Tis nature warns her not t'expose  Herself or offspring to her foes  But sends her to the safe retreat  Where both enjoy their rest and meat  Why rears not man in forest wild  Or acorn grove his fav'rite child  But lodg'd in towns and nurs'd with care  Protects and feeds his fondled heir  Experter sure were human race  If train'd in forests for the chase  The chase that might our food provide  And what need  animals  beside  Lorenzo  here we plainly find  The characters that mark our  kind  'Twas nature  knowledge  did impart  Which time has ripen'd into  art  But call it art or what you will  'Tis nature  human nature  still  As natural for us my friend  To bid the cloudcapt tow'rs ascend  To bid the floating castles ride  On moving mountains of the tide  As for the bird and beast their food  To seek in thicket plain or wood  To build the nest or dig the den  Far distant from the haunts of men  Science  disprove it those who can  Is therefore natural to man  To other animals denied  This best and worst excuse for pride  There are 'tis true who gravely hold  "Grimalkin  's no essential scold  "That men and monkies differ wide  "As Gods to stocks and stones allied"  Striving to prove by various means  "That brutes are nothing but  machines"  There are indeed also some pretended philosophers whose heads so full of  impenetrable matter  have been employ'd to prove MAN  a machine  too but with these we will not dispute  But can we e'er with these suppose  Springs lodg'd within the  terrier  's nose  Direct his nimble feet to go  Where the old  fox  lies earth'd below  Or that by mere mechanicks  tray  Pursues his master's doubtful way  For me I frankly must impute  True syllogism to e'en the brute  A pow'r of reason spite of pride  No more to them than man denied  So much admitting dost thou say  "I fairly throw my cause away  "Unless to brutes Heav'n also give  "In immortality to live"  Lorenzo  noTho' less refin'd  My pleas are of another kind  Low as the dust tho' here we lie  Yet death may raise us to the sky  Is man a  worm  'tis  here  his fate  To winter his  aurelia  state  In time to burst his cell design'd  And leave his claycold case behind  Flutt'ring on angel wings to rise  A bright  papilio  of the skies  Distinguish'd from the beasts my friend  Experience ev'ry doubt may end  Granting "by nature all enjoy  "The pow'rs heav'n meant them to employ  "Passion or instinct ne'er bestow'd  "On man or beast a useless load  "But serving animals in kind  "To th' end for which they were design'd"  This once suppos'd here end disputes  Look round among our fellow brutes  See to what point their labours tend  And how in death their talents end  Perfect the bird and beast we find  Advance not here their sev'ral kind  From race to race no wiser grow  No gradual perfection know  T'increasing knowledge void their claim  Still their specifick pow'rs the same  In th'individual centred all  Tho' generations rise and fall  Meanwhile by observation wise  The human genius never dies  But in tradition kept alive  The wreck of kingdoms doth survive  Or glowing in th'instructive page  Improving lives from age to age  Ev'n giving those who greatly  know  An immortality below  What idle mourner droops his head  Is  Plato Locke  or  Newton  dead  With  Plato  still his pupils rove  Along his academick grove  With  Locke  we wing the naked soul  And mount with  Newton  to the pole  To animals of ev'ry kind  Are then their proper pow'rs assign'd  To actuate strengthen or restrain  Nor sense nor instinct giv'n in vain  Man as an animal confess'd  Distinguish'd plainly from the rest  Behold his pow'rs his labours here  Presumptive of a brighter sphere  Not merely to this life confin'd  The aim and end of humankind  Say if our purpose but to live  What mighty help doth science give  What needed more the human brute  Than cooling springs and strength'ning fruit  Or summer past the diet spare  Of wholesome roots his winter fare  How need our better rest and health  Golconda  's or  Potosi  's wealth  That sacrific'd that health and rest  To fetch it home from east and west  Lorenzo  sure if humankind  For this life only were design'd  As well we ignorant had been  Of luxury the bawd to sin  As well those arts had been without  That give while none can cure the gout  Ah why was speculation given  If not to teach the way to Heav'n  What need have animals below  The planets' paths above to know  Or in what curves meand'ring rove  Satellites  round the orb of  Jove  Lends art its microscopick eye  In nature's miniature to pry  To see beneath the civil knife  The butcher'd atoms robb'd of life  To know that 'scaping from the steel  Thousands may perish at a meal  While conscious ev'ry step we tread  We trample hosts of beings dead  Ah why this knowledge giv'n to raise  Our wonder to our Maker's praise  Why hence inspir'd our God t'adore  If seen in death his face no more  It cannot beOf Heav'nly birth  Science no offspring of the earth  To man hath  Jacob  's ladder giv'n  Reaching its foot on earth to heav'n  O seize with ardour seize the prize  And claim thy kindred to the skies  Genius  Lorenzo  yours or mine  Faint image of the pow'r divine  Endow'd with ev'n  creative  pow'r  To form the beings of an hour  To people worlds to light the skies  To bid a new creation rise  O'er all to wield the thund'rer's rod  And act the momentary God  Ev'n here my friend in nature's plan  Own'd the  divinity  of MAN  A truth that genius feels and knows  As oft as with the God it glows  And shall t'oblivion be consign'd  This portion of etherial mind  O noCome death in any form  I doubt not to ride out the storm  The shipwreck'd body to survive  My thinking part still left alive  Meanwhile through all the modes of sense  Bear me bold  Contemplation  hence  On thy firm wing O let me soar  And idly hope and fear no more  Bear me to th' everblooming groves  Where genius with fair science roves  Where in the cool sequester'd shade  Sits  Resignation  pious maid  To Heav'n directed by whose eye  When drooping nature calls to die  Let  this  my latest  wishes  crown  On her soft lap to lay me down  Whilst mild  content  and gentle  peace  Her handmaids waiting my release  Strow stealing round with softest tread  Their grateful roses o'er my bed  No thorn among to break my rest  By euthanasian slumbers blest  Without a sigh at close of day  To breathe becalm'd my soul away
