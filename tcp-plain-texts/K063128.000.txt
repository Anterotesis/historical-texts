 DISCOURSES ON SCRIPTURE MYSTERIES PREACHED AT ST MARY'S OXFORD BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY IN THE YEAR AT THE LECTURE FOUNDED BY THE LATE REV JOHN BAMPTON M A CANON OF SALISBURY WITH NOTES ILLUSTRATIVE AND CRITICAL  BY WILLIAM HAWKINS M A PREBENDARY OF WELLS VICAR OF WHITCHURCH DORSET AND LATE FELLOW OF PEMBROKECOLLEGE OXFORD  OXFORD PRINTED AT THE CLARENDON PRESS AND SOLD BY D PRINCE AND J COOKE OXFORD AND J F AND C RIVINGTON LONDON  M DCC LXXXVII  IMPRIMATUR  JOS CHAPMAN VICECAN OXON  Aug    TO HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  MY LORD  HAVING had the honour of being appointed preacher of the  Bampton Lectures  for the current year by the Heads of Colleges in Oxford I have the happiness to introduce them to the Public with the additional great advantage of your Grace's protection an advantage the more considerable as it derives as much from the character as the rank of my patron  In this situation it will I presume become me to address your Grace rather under the form of preface than in the style of dedication  My slender pretensions to your favour are grounded in the earnest endeavour of the following sheets fully and circumstantially to vindicate that faith which I need not tell your Grace is not barely attacked but insulted every day The Charity which  is not easily provoked  must resent the freedom I had almost said the audacity which distinguishes the infidels of the present generation These Gentlemen affect to be the party aggrieved and to console themselves at the same time with a hope and sometimes a persuasion of the speedy abolition of confessions and systems and in consequence  of it the revival of evangelical doctrine in its native simplicity  I cannot think opinions openly and arrogantly hostile to the national establishment can be justified even by their sincerity But infidelity in general is without this excuse it has been repeatedly shewn to draw its principal resources from the vigilance of captiousness the popularity of profession the artifice of dissimulation the confusion of things not really connected and the occasional suppression or adulteration of truth To these I am sorry for our own sakes to add the inconsistency between certain controversial terms and the imprudence or unwariness of concession Such resources as these are indeed inexhaustible Mr  Bampton  's wise and pious institution and every  other of a similar nature supposes as much We contend with enemies who though with unequal forces will always be able to take the field However my Lord I flatter myself I have happily chosen more advantageous ground than many of my fellowsoldiers in this warfare to whose names on other accounts I look up with deference and veneration After all the event must be left in the hands of Providence I have only to beg the favour of the intelligent reader to peruse these discourses and the annexed annotations which will be equally necessary with an inclination to be satisfied and in that spirit of candor and impartiallity with which I trust he will find them to have been composed I request his attention throughout the performance and reasonable allowances for the inaccuracy  or inequality that may be discovered in it I hope he will be biassed not by speciousness of principle or habit of attachment but by preponderance of argument I submit it to his judgment whether I have in any instance shewn an undue warmth or unwarrantable resentment and desire him finally to determine as he shall upon the whole be persuaded not of the abilities of the advocate but the merits of the cause Open to conviction myself I shall always be ready to rectify an error or to renounce an opinion on competent representation but shall not pay the least regard to any censure or animadversion the features of which shall manifestly betray it to be the offspring of prepossession chagrin or malevolence  With sincerest wishes and prayers for your Grace's health and happiness and for the peace and prosperity of that Church over which you so worthily preside  I remain With all duty and respect  My LORD  Your much obliged and Most obedient servant WILLIAM HAWKINS  Extract from the last Will and Testament of the late Reverend  JOHN BAMPTON  Canon of  Salisbury  I give and bequeath my Lands and Estates to the Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford for ever to have and to hold all and singular the said Lands or Estates upon trust and to the intents and purposes herein after mentioned that is to say I will and appoint that the ViceChancellor of the University of Oxford for the time being shall take and receive all the rents issues and profits thereof and after all taxes reparations and necessary deductions made that he pay all the remainder to the endowment of eight Divinity Lecture Sermons to be established for ever in the said University and to be performed in the manner following  I direct and appoint that upon the first Tuesday in Easter Term a Lecturer be yearly chosen by the Heads of Colleges only and by no others in the room adjoining to the PrintingHouse between  the hours of ten in the morning and two in the afternoon to preach eight Divinity Lecture Sermons the year following at St Mary's in Oxford between the commencement of the last month in Lent Term and the end of the third week in Act Term  Also I direct and appoint that the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons shall be preached upon either of the following subjectsto confirm and establish the Christian Faith and to confute all heretics and schismaticsupon the divine authority of the Holy Scripturesupon the authority of the writings of the primitive Fathers as to the faith and practice of the primitive Churchupon the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christupon the Divinity of the Holy Ghostupon the Articles of the Christian Faith as comprehended in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds  Also I direct that thirty copies of the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons shall be always printed within two months after they are preached and one copy shall be given to the Chancellor of the University and one copy to the Head of every College  and one copy to the Mayor of the City of Oxford and one copy to be put into the Bodleian Library and the expence of printing them shall be paid out of the revenue of the Lands or Estates given for establishing the Divinity Lecture Sermons and the Preacher shall not be paid nor be entitled to the revenue before they are printed  Also I direct and appoint that no person shall be qualified to preach the Divinity Lecture Sermons unless he hath taken the Degree of Master of Arts at least in one of the two Universities of Oxford or Cambridge and that the same person shall never preach the Divinity Lecture Sermons twice  DISCOURSE I  JOHN XVIII  Pilate saith unto him What is Truth  THIS question of all by far the most important was put to our blessed Saviour by the  Roman Governour  perhaps carelessly perhaps contemptuously but certainly without the least wish for information In much the same spirit of scorn or with similar indifference the same question is every day in the mouths sometimes of sceptics and scoffers and sometimes of men of a more serious cast who affect to be persuaded that we cannot and it may be desire not to give them satisfaction Unhappily the Christian world is divided and subdivided almost infinitely  it is parcelled out into sectaries of a thousand denominations The fact is though the right of private judgment in matters of religion which has been exercised from the beginning was justly and necessarily asserted by the leaders and friends of the REFORMATION it must be acknowledged folly perverseness pride and enthusiasm have by severally maintaining it been productive of that strange multiplicity of religious sentiment which we have so much cause to lament of that schism heresy scepticism and infidelity which have all along disturbed the Church but fix a mark of peculiar disgrace on the last and present century  And indeed when it is considered that the Scriptures are on many accounts particularly liable to be misapplied perverted or misconstrued  a  that some passages are to be understood in a literal and some in a figurative sense that some things are expressed agreeably to the modes of common speech and some in pure condescension to the human capacity that passages are to be compared  with each other in order to a true understanding of them and doctrines to be deduced not so much from single and separate texts as from the manifest tenor of the Scriptures at large that not unfrequently one and the same text shall be capable of different and even opposite construction that though most places in holy writ are of universal importance yet some are of temporary and occasional purport only that the sacred writings strictly speaking are the foundation of a rule of faith and manners such as a creed formulary or confession rather than the rule itself as will I trust in due time more fully appear and that an assent to the collective body of scripture as true does not imply a knowlege or belief of all scriptural truths when all this to which more were there occasion might be added is fairly considered we cannot possibly be at a loss to account for that variety of notion that wildness and absurdity of conceit that extravagance or impiety of opinion which I just now observed has more or less so shamefully dishonoured the Christian name in all ages  Of this exuberance of folly and wickedness Popery has ever been industrious to avail itself From the acknowledged liableness of the Scriptures to the grossest abuse when in the hands of such as are  unlearned  and  unstable  to use the apostle's words the Church of  Rome  draws her most specious argument against the common use of them and would fain have us infer the necessity or the certainty of an infallible authority lodged in the Church for the decision of controversies and ascertainment of a rule of faith from the confessed convenience and utility of such an authority  b  But unfortunately for her pretensions as much error and absurdity has repeatedly been demonstrated to be within her pale as out of it  Wh t is truth  becomes therefore with many a question of as much difficulty as importance or rather of more form than importance some encouraging themselves in scepticism from these circumstances and others blindly acquiescing in any mode of religion or in none at all or at best in that which is usually called natural religion from a pretence of the utter impossibility of  discovering the true under such a complication of perplexity  With points of inferior consequence I shall not trouble myself but to such as deny or call in question the capital articles of our religion on the strength of the above considerations let me insist that nothing of this nature ought to supersede their endeavours to find the truth and much less to discourage their obedience to it when found After inquiry we may in some respect or other be mistaken but without it we are inexcusable In fact the very diversity or contrariety complained of may be justly urged in behalf of the faith which is received in the Church Were the doctrine of the Trinity for instance impugned from one quarter only and by consistent and uniform opposition infidelity would be a much more formidable thing than it is but you may as well look for  one language  at  Babel  as for a catholic system of unbelief if I may be indulged with the expression To enumerate all the heresies which have at different times torn and dismembered the  Church of Christ is in a manner to confute them and these their common animosity against her excepted are  at  perpetual  enmity  among themselves Nay what is yet more extraordinary we shall find infidelity itself abounding in mysteries even while it reprobates them almost with the confidence of a  faith  which  could remove mountains  If the sacred theory we are to maintain be in many respects incomprehensible the substitutions of human wisdom will in due time be shewn to be at least equally so and to require the same degree of assent without any thing like the same foundation  What is truth say  others  among us  what is it but a system of doctrines officially taught and formally transmitted from generation to generation  But if doctrines are true why not officially taught and carefully transmitted Is profession ridiculous or authority contemptible as such Indeed the question is not what saith the Churchbut  what saith the  Scripture  Now by Scripture and the earliest antiquity our surest guide and purest precedent we are not only willing but wishful to be tried It is true the bulk of Christians are not equal to this trial in a certain sense they  care for none of these things  they take matters upon trust they are not able to  give an answer to every man that asketh a reason of the  faith  that is in them  except that they were born and bred in it and suppose it to be unquestionable It is with respect to this implicitness of assent this tameness of acquiescence as it is opprobriously called that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity has no less impiously than ludicrously been exposed to contempt under the description of the  See p in Preface to  Stilling fleet  's Discourse in vindication of the doctrine of the Trinity  Trinity of the Mob  But this is very unfair representation Surely no argument can be drawn from the incapacity or the credulity of the  many  to the disadvantage of a doctrine that with respect to the grounds on which we defend it solicits demands defies the penetration of enquiry and the inquisitiveness  of criticism The spiritual state of the  common people  all over the world falls nearly under the same predicament but at the same time a proportionable degree of satisfaction will always be derived to every man from every degree of rational assurance that he is in the  right way  or belongs to a communion wherein the truth is held in purity approaching nearest to the standard of primitive Christianity  What is truth  Say others We are no strangers to the doctrines publicly established to the faith asserted in your Articles and expressed in your Creeds but to these  Subscription  is much more universal than agreement We can produce you names even among yourselves of persons  not a whit behind the very chiefest  Divines in point of rank probity or understanding who nevertheless hold that  God  is to be  worshipped after a way which  you  call heresy  who  preach another Gospel than that which ye have received  from your fathers  constantly affirming  or perpetually insinuating that  ye do err not knowing the Scriptures  Too true indeed it is that the principal controverted points subsisting among those "who profess and call themselves Christians" are of the most serious nature If the tenets of our gainsayers and adversaries of many appellations are right and just the doctrines of the Trinity and of the resurrection of the body which will be the objects of the ensuing disquisitions are heresies of the most abominable or ridiculous tendency However these are circumstances which should not check but stimulate the spirit of investigation It will be of infinite moment to inquire whether we or they are the mistaken party and on which side error really lies whether  our  doctrines or  theirs  have the strongest foundation in scripture and antiquity are best supported by presumptive argument and corroborative evidence or have least recourse to artifice and the pitifulness of subterfuge and evasion We do not wish to have this matter determined either vulgarly by a majority of voices or invidiously by the reputation of names  But again say others  What is truth  What good purpose is answered or what advantage gained by this extraordinary zeal for theory and establishment What doth it but  gender strifes  and feed the flame of contention The practical doctrines of the gospel are so forcibly yet so familiarly inculcated as not to be liable to misinterpretation  Concerning the faith  thousands  have erred  but  as  one  of  our  own poets  hath  said  "His can't be wrong whose life is in the right"  It is well for us there is nothing argumentative in the jingle of a couplet I confess myself to be one of those who are hurt by every effort that has a plain aspect towards resolving all religion into morality I consider every attempt of this kind as an indirect attack upon the fundamentals of Christianity According to the idea of these reasoners the character of the  Messiah  and of the  Son of God  will dwindle into that of a mere Legislator or moral philosopher who  teaches us to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world  Tit ii  This text and texts  congenerous with this may plausibly be urged in exaltation of  good works  to the exclusion of faith but let them be contrasted with the following  he that believeth and is baptiz'd shall be saved  Mark xvi  he that believe thon the Son hath everlasting life  John vi  c c and  where is boasting  on the part of moral honesty or evangelical righteousness As speciously or as justly as men may harangue in demonstration of the excellence of piety and virtue or as loudly or as reasonably as they may exclaim against the violence and much more the virulence which has actuated the spirit of controversy in too many instances I presume no intelligent person if he is impartial will deny that the  faith  which St  Jude  tells us  was once delivered to the Saints  whatever we are precisely to understand by it is something entirely distinct from mere morality that it ought  earnestly  to be  contended for  agre ably to the same Apostle's exhortation that it is very possible to contend with  meekness  that errors and schisms and heresies are represented in scripture as things more or less sinful dangerous and damnable and  that consequently it is of the utmost importance to our spiritual interests to be right in principle as well as in practice The petulancy the pride and the malevolence of bigots and of  disputers of this world  as the Apostle calls them will no doubt be  brought into judgment  no less than the grossest immoralities but this will not by any means supersede or retard an honest and charitable attempt to enquire into and ascertain the leading doctrines of our common Christianity  Complaints against the damnatory clauses of the  Athanasian  Creed as it is commonly called reverberate from more quarters than one People do not seem to be sufficiently aware that a right faith and a good life are required by this form of confession under the same penalty  Which faith except a man keep whole and undefiled without doubt he shall perish everlastingly They that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they that have done evil into everlasting fire This is the catholic faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved  It is plain these clauses are to be considered as simply declarative on scriptural grounds of the necessity both of faith and of good works to salvation and at the same time as leaving all men to that infinite mercy and those inestimable merits which are fully adequate to the pardon and atonement of sins failings ignorances and errors of integrity  c  Which few considerations will I apprehend fairly deliver the Creed before us from the reproach of uncharitableness With regard to the several articles of which it consists I trust they will be found in the course of these disquisitions to have foundation in a fully competent authority and in the mean time I shall endeavour to remove one general prejudice against them and to create rather a prepossession in their favour by evincing that their acknowleged mysteriousness and incomprehensibility does by no means unqualify them for our assent  "Man is as such a rational creature" and as a rational creature he is a believing one too We can no more conceive him to be  without belief than without sense thought or reflection The Atheist who  says in his heart  as well as with his lips  there is no God  believes there is none He protests against the supposed folly or extravagance of the fundamental article of all religion and on the strength of false conclusions resolves every thing into a concourse of atoms fortuitously uniting or into the operation of an unintelligent principle which we call nature or in other words into an everlasting succession of causes and effects It is possible for a man to deny his own existence or that there is any such thing as motion We have heard of instances of this sort though properly they are instances not of false persuasion but of insanity  d  Still man is a rational creature whether he reasons well or ill and whether in consequence of such reasoning his faith be well or ill grounded It is certain we know little or nothing by intuition The mind yields assent to many mysterious truths by forming a very small chain of deductions such as the immensity of space the infinite progression of number and eternity as well  a  parte ante  as  a parte post  Space and duration says an ingenious author are mysterious abysses in which our thoughts are confounded with demonstrable propositions to all sense and reason flatly contradictory to one another Any two points of time though never so distant are each of them exactly in the middle of eternity The remotest points of space that can be imagined are each of them precisely in the centre of infinite space  See  Deism Revealed  Vol p  In fact we have no stronger or more adequate conception of immensity than of omnipresence we have no clearer idea of the existence of SOMETHING from all eternity than we have of eternal generation Faith it is true strictly speaking has reference to religion only  See Note at p of  Howes  's  Discourse on the abuse of the Talent of Disputation in Religion c  but I hope a truth or a mystery is not inadmissible purely on account of its respecting practice or implying obligation This will readily be granted even by infidels who deny the truths of Revelation and much more by such Christians as have  called into debate particular points of that Revelation to which in general they profess to subscribe It is well worth remarking that Deists and Heretics never fail to attack the professed atheist with such reasonings as if pursued through their just consequences may fairly and successfully be enforced upon themselves For if  he  affects to decry the fundamental principle of all religion the Being of a God on account of the pretended inconceivableness of it will not  they  observe in order to confute him that unless a more complete a more uniform and intelligible system could be built on the ruins of this great article such his exception can have no weight And this is the very reasoning we urge against the principles both of deists and heretics With the professed atheist I shall no farther concern myself but desire to observe that deists and heretics of all denominations are agreed with us in one general point the acknowlegement of the existence of God and consequently the incomprehensibleness of the Divine nature attributes and operations The primary notion  which the human mind frames of God is this general and complex yet negative idea of incomprehensibleness There is a certain preeminence if I may so call it in the Divine essence c which utterly precludes investigation But if so all mysteries whether natural or religious whether relative  e g  to the extension of space c or to the nature of the Deity all these if considered purely as mysteries will stand upon a level in point of credibility And let a revelation be supposed all adventitious truths introduced thereby will be fixed upon the same foot because faith cannot have a stronger foundation in human reason than in divine authority This is granted without difficulty but then as the deist denies the authenticity of those writings which we affirm to contain such revelation so the heretic disputes the sense and scope of them The question therefore is whether the opinion of the one and the unbelief of the other is respectively the result of judgment or of passion of conviction or of pride of impartial enquiry or of unwillingness to submit the understanding of man to  the  wisdom of God  For I repeat it neither the one nor the other can consistently with his own principles and acknowledgments controvert the received sense or deny the authority of those writings which the Church holds to be the  Word of God  barely on account of mysterious truths contained in them If the Divine Essence be necessarily incomprehensible no Revelation can possibly make it less so so far from it that the very idea of a Divine Revelation with respect to that essence implies a Revelation of mysteries  i e  of truths undiscoverable and inconceivable by our natural powers and accordingly the credit of Revelation is rather confirmed than weakened by the number and importance of such truths For it is but natural to expect a more ample display of wonders and larger discoveries of sublime and sacred points of faith in this Revelation and surely God is not the less to be believed the more he communicates to us of his nature properties and dispensations As far as these remarks affect Revelation in general heretics in general will admit the justness  of them though at the very instant that they allow the writings in question to be the sole rule of faith they endeavour as much as may be to reduce that rule to the measure of their own judgments and apprehensions I am however already justified in asserting that as much as some people are averse to believing what they do not understand they cannot avoid believing what they do not understand and that therefore on proper authority it is full as reasonable to believe an hundred mysteries as one  e  And here taking my leave of the deist I would desire the heretic by what appellation soever distinguished to recollect that Revelation left human nature as it found it I mean with respect to our intellectual faculties that  from the beginning of the creation  to this very hour man is to be considered as a reasonable creature as a freeagent as sometimes believing upon competent evidence sometimes governed by passions and sometimes influenced by prepossession A truth which accounts in a moment for the multitude of persuasions which have engaged the speculative world To expect  or require that God should manifest himself and his proceedings c to every man fully and personally is to destroy every notion not only of faith but of obedience likewise and to wish to invert the essential frame and constitution of things Difficulties unsurmountable difficulties of many kinds occur to our contemplations on that frame and constitution difficulties on which the light of Revelation darts not a single beam If we indulge the excursive faculty of imagination beyond the bounds which reason and scripture have set us we shall find ourselves inextricably entangled in perplexity and sometimes in impiety too Who shall discover the consistency between Divine prescience and human freewill Yet that man acts freely and that God foreknows all events and decrees accordingly are equally truths not to be shaken by any seeming irreconcileableness or contrariety whatsoever So again that the most perfect  freedom  of agency must be ascribed to God cannot possibly be controverted and yet does he not  necessarily  foreknow his own actions Does  not  necessarily  act agreeably to the eternal rules of justice wisdom and holiness That God is in no sense the author of evil either natural or moral every reasonable man and much more every Christian will maintain yet is it not certain that had this world never been made neither  sin  nor  death  could have  entered  into it Human wisdom has fatigued itself to no purpose in the ventilation of these subjects  f  Many real truths but at present seeming paradoxes will doubtless be capable of future explication and spiritual things in general should rather be received with the humility of reverence than encountered with the arrogance of discussion There will be no end to  doubtful disputations  while men's sentiments are modified by a partial attachment to a favourite principle and while truths apparently opposite and contradictory are separately contended for which ought both to be admitted as ultimately they will be reconciled  What has been here advanced concerning faith or mysteries in general will I trust  secure at least a fair and earnest attention to what I shall have to offer in defence of the mysteries of the Gospel If these mysteries should be found to be real objects of faith it will be neither right nor safe to think or to speak of them indifferently unhandsomely or contemptuously  That the doctrines of the Church of  England  the doctrine of one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity and that of the Resurrection of the Body are as reconcileable to our ideas as the consistency of freewill with necessity or of the Divine perfections with the existence of evil I should suppose no man can deny and therefore the great question is whether those doctrines be undeniably in those Scriptures which all with whom I am concerned acknowledge to be the rule of faith  That with respect to the Trinity the doctrine of the Church has been so long so frequently so copiously agitated with much less success on our part than might have been expected from some of the best  Soldiers of Jesus Christ  the  weapons  of whose  warfare  have been  mighty  in this spiritual field this I must confess is a circumstance enough discouraging but however not without its counterbalance in certain considerations  The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong  Matters are capable of being set in new lights nor will any exertion be desperate which has for its object the honour of God and the peace of his Church Men are wedded to their errors as much as to their vices but as we are not to be remiss or hopeless in our labours for the reformation of sinners though the  whole world  should  lie in wickedness  so neither should we be impeded or disheartened in our attempts for the conversion of infidels and heretics by that pride that prejudice however contracted that  hardness  or that  slowness of heart  which indisposes them for the reception of truthAfter all inquiries of this nature are of very considerable use and importance they cannot fail at least to  stablish strengthen  and  settle  ourselves to  root  and  ground  us in that  faith  which we shall find to be built upon the most immoveable foundations  That assertors and vindicators of this faith that champions for the Church militant might never be wanting in this place the zeal and the piety the wisdom and the munificence of our founder hath nobly provided The present institution is happily distinguished by its location and in some degree to answer and accomplish it's end I shall proceed with as much confidence and satisfaction as may reasonably be supposed to arise from a proper sense of obligation a full persuasion of the truth of the great doctrines in question and particularly of the merits of the  Trinitarian  cause  DISCOURSE II  JOHN V  Search the Scriptures  TO the Scriptures of the Old Testament our blessed Saviour referred the  Jews  for satisfaction with respect to his claims to the character in which he appeared among them and to the Scriptures of the New Testament together with the other I am to refer for proofs of those great but mysterious doctrines which I have undertaken to defend the doctrines contained in the Liturgy and in the Articles of the Church of  England  Without laying before you at present all or the principal texts by which the doctrine  of the Trinity is supported or in which the absolute divinity both of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is explicitly asserted or necessarily implied we may previously remark that supposing them to be authentic unequivocal and intelligible the infidel is in fact precluded from taking advantage of those passages which are declarative either of the acknowleged humanity of Jesus Christ or of the gifts and operations of the blessed Spirit that humanity and those operations being things manifestly distinct from the Divine essence and real personality What we shall have to do therefore will be to enquire in due time and place whether the exceptions which have been made against the texts with which the catholic doctrine is fortified are grounded in principles of common candour and common sense or in other words whether the interpretations of antitrinitarians are critically just and agreable to the rules which are generally allowed to govern interpretation In the mean time it will be well worth while to examine whether the doctrine before us  is not proveable by evidence which though indirect and collateral is irresistible There is hardly any such thing as framing a sentence or a proposition that cannot be prevaricated with but the tenor of a context and the weight of circumstances will not easily admit of sophistication  According to the Athanasian Creed as it is called  the Catholic Faith is this that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity and that the Godhead of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is all one the Glory equal the Majesty coeternal  But what saith the Scripture Saith it not  in effect  the same also  That the Father is the first Person in the Trinity merely in order of nomination the Son the second and the Holy Ghost the third is sufficiently demonstrable from many considerations In the first place though the three divine Persons are usually mentioned in a manner which at first sight seems to import an order of a different kind yet this order is upon some occasions  inverted  e g  in St  Paul  's often quoted benediction to the  Corinthians The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you  and in the following passage of the same Apostle  there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all  Cor xii  And in other places the same inversion is observable with regard to the first and second persons  Ye know  says the Apostle  that no whoremonger nor unclean person c hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God  Ephes v  Now our Lord Jesus Christ  HIMSELF says the same Apostle  and God even our Father which hath loved us comfort your hearts c No man  says our Lord  knoweth the Son but the Father neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him  Matt xi  To this we may add the introduction of St  Paul  's epistle to the  Galatians Paul an Apostle not of men neither by man  but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who hath raised him from the dead  c From these instances we may at least draw this inference that the general priority of order above mentioned imports no distinction or preeminence of essence  The root ground or fountain of essence may be acknowledged to be in the  Father  without the least prejudice to the  Trinitarian  doctrine which supposes an ETERNAL communication to the Son and to the Holy Ghost The terms  root  and  fountain  c are customary indeed but by no means strictly proper or precisely descriptive They are familiar not to our ideas but to our ears When we speak of or contemplate the Divine nature absolutely and without reference to particular dispensations God the  Father  is generally the first in our conception as far as he can be the object of conception but not to the exclusion of the Divine nature either of the  Son  or  Holy Ghost  In these dispensations in the heavenly oeconomy we have a manifest and obvious reason for addressing our  prayers and petitions public and private for the most part to the first Person of the Holy Trinity In short the terms  Father  and  Son  under which it has pleased infinite wisdom by way of analogy to represent this mysterious relation to our minds these terms imply nothing more than nominal preeminence and subordination if the Antitrinitarian should insist that they do imply more and ask what we mean by eternal generation or procession we will answer him the moment we are told what he means by eternal essence itself  g  Again The Father is commonly represented to us under the character of the maker the governor preserver and judge of the world the Son under that of our redeemer advocate and saviour the Holy Ghost under that of our guide comforter and sanctifier and yet these characters we shall see with the names properties and attributes of the Deity are frequently reciprocated Thus in the following places among others the office of Redeemer is ascribed in  expess terms to the first person or if you please to God absolutely considered  God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave I will ransom them from the power of the grave I will redeem them from death  Hosea xiii  My soul shall rejoice which thou hast redeemed  Psalm lxxi  So likewise in numberless passages the Father is styled Saviour To instance only a few  There is no God else beside me a just God and a Saviour  Isa xlv  Paul an apostle c by the commandment of God our Saviour  Tim i  c  We trust in the living God who is the Saviour of all men To the only wise God our Saviour be glory and majesty now and ever  Jude v  And again the work of sanctification is indiscriminately said to be the work of Father Son and Holy Ghost Thus our bodies are sometimes called the  temple of God  and sometimes of the  Holy Ghost  The Apostle declares that  it is God which worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure  The same Apostle prays that  the very God of peace may sanctify the Thessalonians and  make  his  Hebrew  converts  perfect in every good work to do his will working in them that which is wellpleasing in his sight  and not to multiply examples St  Jude  addresses his general Epistle to  those that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ  To which we may add that the Father hath sometimes other titles and characters given him which belong more peculiarly to the Holy Spirit and is called the  God of consolation  and the  God of all comfort  as according to one Apostle  all scripture is given by inspiration of God  while we are assured by another that  holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost  Tim iii Pet i  Again We find all the great properties and characters of the first Person frequently attributed to the second In a  Passage  in  Isaiah  he is even called the  h everlasting Father  The Father of the everlasting age  Bp  Lowth  And to lay no stress upon prophetic phraseology is not the first person the supreme God a selfexistent independent Being the creator the governor and preserver of the world  So is  Jesus Christ  For  before Abraham was  says he  I am  John viii  and he that came from heaven is above all he filleth all in all he is the head and by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible c All things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and upholdeth all things by the word of his power and by him all things consist  Coloss i  Of some of these and the following texts at present we shall take the sense to be granted Is God the Father a being eternal and unchangeable So is God the Son For  he hath neither beginning of days nor end of life He is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty  Rev i  Jesus Christ the same yesterday to day and for ever  Is omniscience an attribute of the true God So is it likewise of him whom he  sent into  the world For he  knew all things  he  knew what was in man  he  knoweth the hearts of all men  Acts i  he it is who searcheth the reins and heart  Can any power less than infinite  raise the dead And is it not the prerogative of the Supreme God to judge the world Yet to do both is the work of  Jesus Christ  For he is  the resurrection and the life  John xi v  and as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he will and whoso eateth his flesh hath eternal life and he will raise him up at the last day  Ibid vi  In consequence of such resurrection  we must all appear before his judgment seat  Cor v  And once more is not the true God invisible and incomprehensible So is  Jesus Christ  For agreably to a text before cited  no man knoweth the Son but the Father  Again The character and office of the Third Person are explicitly attributed to  Jesus Christ  The Apostle's wish or benediction which we have already had occasion to refer to may be produced as one instance of this  Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work For without Christ we can do nothing and he of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption  John xi v  and he gave himself for the Church that he might sanctify and cleanse it  and the Apostle could  do all things through Christ which strengthned him  Farther the characters and properties both of the  first  and  second  Person in the Holy Trinity are likewise many of them ascrib'd to the  third  Thus in the old Testament the work of creation seems to be attributed to the operation of the Holy Ghost as a distinct personage or agent  The Spirit of God  says  Moses moved upon the face of the waters Thou sendest forth thy spirit  says the Psalmist  and they are created  and  Job  asserts that  God by his Spirit hath garnish'd the heavens  Job xxvi  and  the Spirit of God ha smade me  says  Elihu  Ibid xxxiii  For whatever might have been the precise notion of the antient  Jews  with regard to the  Spirit  the  Spirit of God  and the  Spirit of the Lord  of which we find such frequent mention or whatever they might understand by that parallel expression in respect at least of the work of creation the  breath of the Almighty  or the  breath of his mouth  the light of the New Testament I  Cor i  think sufficiently directs us to the above interpretation Thus again the Holy Ghost is omniscient and eternal for the  Spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God  Cor ii  and  Christ through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God  Heb ix  Thus the office of advocate or intercessor is attributed to the  Spirit who maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God  Rom viii  Thus the resurrection of our Lord himself is said to have been effected by the power of the  Holy Ghost  for  Christ was put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit  Pet iii  and he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in us  Thus again both Prophets and Apostles are said to be sent or commissioned by the  Holy Ghost  as well as by the  Father  and the  Son The Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me  says  Isaiah the Spirit entered into me  says  Ezekiel and said unto me go shut thyself within thy house  Ezek iii  and  the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabus and Saul for the work whereunto I  have called them  Acts xiii  Once more The Holy Ghost is indiscriminately called the  Spirit of God  and the  Spirit of Christ  and the  Gospel of God  and the  Gospel of Christ  are terms equivalent and the Apostles are sometimes stiled  servants of God  and sometimes  servants of Jesus Christ  and the  Holy Ghost  is said to  make overseers over the flock  as God the  Father  hath  set some in the Church first Apostles  c and as the  Son gave some Apostles and some Prophets  c And lastly the very terms of our salvation are reciprocated St  Paul testified to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ  Acts xx  and among the  principles of the doctrine of Christ  the Apostle reckons  repentance from dead works and faith towards God  Heb vi  Our Saviour says in one place  he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life  and in another place  he that believeth on him that sent him hath everlasting life  The general scripture doctrine is that we are saved by the mercy of God through the merits of our Redeemer  and yet our salvation is sometimes ascribed absolutely to the mercy or grace of  Jesus Christ  Thus St  Peter  declares his and his brethren's belief that both  Jews  and  Gentiles shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ  Acts xv  and St  Jude  exhorts Christians to  keep themselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life  Jude  To all this we may add that the title of  Lord  which is one unquestionable character of supremacy is common to the three Persons in the  Holy Trinity  to the second it is applied as well as to the first in places almost numberless and to the third beyond all doubt in the following  the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ  Thess iii  now God himself and our Father  where by the way the wordHIMSELFdoes not appear to be more emphatical than in the text sometime since cited  and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towards another c to the end he may stablish your  hearts unblameable in holiness before God at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ*  For that by the  Lord  in these texts we are to understand the  Holy Ghost  is I apprehend demonstrable from these two considerations first because it is his peculiar office to  direct the heart to make us to increase in love and to stablish our hearts unblameable in holiness  and secondly because according to any other construction we shall at best make but very indifferent sense of either of these passages From this inversion then and reciprocation of which we have produced such a number of instances the Divinity of each Person in the Trinity may reasonably be inferred especially as the sense of many at least of the texts I have produced is obvious and altogether uncontrovertible  Again this great point is evincible from the necessary sense or natural import of certain passages Let us turn to a few of the most remarkable  Thess iii  The  sin against the Holy Ghost  is pronounced by our blessed Lord himself to be of all sins the most damnable  I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come  Matt xii  Now without staying to inquire here into the precise nature of this sin or how far it may be absolutely incapable of remission or in what sense our Saviour's audience understood him or he meant to be understood it will be sufficient for our purpose to remark that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in general and particularly of the personal existence and coequal divinity of the  Holy Ghost  with that of the  Father  and of the  Son  is plainly and truly though covertly comprehended in the above texts and in their parallels in the other Evangelists For otherwise we shall be unavoidably driven into  the following absurd and execrable conclusions  viz  that the highest degree of impiety and profaneness against God the  Father  is a mere venial sin and that a blasphemy or a sin a sin humanly speaking at least without hope or possibility of pardon may be committed against a Being less than the supreme God and even against a kind of spiritual chimera a motion a virtue a quality or an operation  Again  As touching brotherly love  says St  Paul ye need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another  Thess iv  Now that by him who in this place is absolutely styled God we are to understand  Jesus Christ  I have little or no difficulty to pronounce for the two following reasons first because though we may very properly be said to be  taught of God  when we are instructed by the mouth or by the preaching of his prophets or apostles or others commission'd by him yet the doctrine of universal love and charity was more immediately  and peculiarly the doctrine of our blessed Saviour  A new commandment  says he  I give unto you that ye love one anotherby this all all men know that ye are  MY  disciples if ye have love one to another  John xiii    this is  MY  commandment that ye love one another  John xiv  and secondly because the Apostle seems to regard this great duty as a principle recently taught and particularly enforced by the precept and example of our Divine Master  Again  He that hath seen me hath seen the Father  John i  says our Lord and  he that seeth me seeth him that sent me  Now in what sense are these declarations true Not in the literal for the  Father  could not be visible in the human person of the  Son  because  God is a Spirit and no man hath seen God at any time whom no man hath seen or can see  Tim vi  and by necessary consequence our Saviour hereby in effect asserts that notwithstanding his appearance in the flesh he himself really and truly partook of the Divine nature that according  to his own expression the  Father dwelt in him  or in the language of the Apostle in him  dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily  or substantially  Again In the Gospels St  John  the Baptist is called  the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths strait  Matt iii  but in the evangelical prophet the style is at once more explicit and more majestical  prepare ye  says he  the way of the Lord make strait in the desart a highway for our God  Isa xl  In the course of the same sublime chapter  Jerusalem  is called upon to  lift up her voice with strength  to  lift it up and say unto the cities of Judah Behold your God  And then the prophecy proceeds in the following words  Behold the Lord God will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him He shall feed his flock like a shepherd  c Now unless it can be demonstrated that these passages do not refer ultimately at least to the coming and to the  person of the Messiah he is manifestly here announced under the different characters of a  good shepherd  a  righteous judge  and the  Lord God  Besides if there is no such reference the several apostolical citations from the prophet are most impertinently ridiculous  Once more The first and second persons of the blessed Trinity are expressly distinguished and respectively characterised as equal in a passage wherein the Apostle occasionally asserts the unity of essence in the Godhead  We know  says he  that there is none other God but one for though there be that are called Gods to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him  Cor viii c  It may be pretended indeed that the terms under which the  Son  is here characterised are not of equal weight and significance with those which are descriptive of the  Father  but I will take upon me to aver that the same might have been pretended had these terms been transposed  and the passage had run thus  to us there is but one God the Father  by  whom are all things and we  by  him and one Lord Jesus Christ  of  whom are all things and we  in  him  And in many places the three divine Persons are severally specified and referred to as jointly concurring in the wonderful scheme of man's redemption particularly in the following St  Peter  inscribes his first epistle to the  strangers scattered through Pontus Galatia c elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ  and St  John  salutes the  churches  of  Asia  with wishing them  grace and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ  Rev  I am sensible indeed that by the  seven spirits  just mentioned interpreters do not universally understand the  Holy Ghost  but this at least I cannot help remarking may be offered in favour of the sense in which I have taken the expression that it is a sense of which the  words are full as capable as of any other whatever and that by the present construction a very considerable difficulty is removed which clogs a different interpretation For admitting the  Holy Ghost  to be signified by the  seven spirits  there will be nothing singular or unprecedented in this inversion of the order of Persons in the  Trinity  but why  angels  according to the sense of some commentators should be mentioned before  Jesus Christ  who is higher than the angels even in many of our adversaries conceptions seems accountable only by forced and unnatural explications And still more perplexed and incompatible with the nature of a blessing or a salutation in general or with the apostolical greetings and benedictions in particular the sense of others seems to be who by the  seven spirits  understand the  graces  of the  Spirit  or the various operations of Divine Providence  i  However granting the passage to be rather obscure I would take occasion to observe from it yet farther that although we should be very cautious of deducing doctrines of faith from symbols or mystical expressions  yet types and emblems confessedly significant and characteristical will justify our suitable conclusions It may be questioned perhaps what is precisely to be understood by the  seven spirits  just mentioned or by many other symbols in the  Revelation  but it would be excess of perverseness to doubt whether the  Lamb  in our Apostle's allegorical prophecy be the emblem of  Jesus Christ  Whenever therefore we observe divine honours plainly ascribed to the  Lamb  or find him spoken of in terms of equal importance and majesty with those which are predicated of him who is indisputably the true God the inference is obvious and unavoidable How then will the  antitrinitarian  evade the force of such passages as these  And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth c heard I saying Blessing and glory and honour and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ever and ever  Rev v  The Lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings  Rev xvii  I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty  and the Lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the Sun c for the glory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is the light thereof  Rev xxi    And he shewed me a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb  Rev xxii i    And the kings of the earth and the great men c hid themselves in the rocks and the mountains and said unto the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb  Rev vi  If any man should affect to make a distinction betwixt  him that sitteth on the throne and the Lamb  or him who is said to  sit on the right hand of God  in proof of the superiority of the former I would desire him to remember that the throne in question is called sometimes simply the  throne of God  sometimes as in a text lately produced the  throne of God and of the Lamb  that in another place the  Lamb  is said to be  in the midst of the throne  in another to  sit down in the throne of the Father  and that it is the  throne  of the  Son of God  which is  for ever and ever  So likewise notwithstanding the diversity of constructions to which the expression of the  seven spirits  is liable the personality operation and Divinity of the  Holy Ghost  may be demonstrated from the plain literal sense of many places in this book which are utterly void of emblematical ornament or allusion Indeed the whole was evidently dictated by the  Spirit  by whose  inspiration all scripture was given  who alone  searcheth the deep things of God  Cor ii  and under whose immediate direction our Apostle wrote this epistle for he tells us expressly before he communicates his Revelations that he  was in the Spirit on the Lord's day  and elsewhere that he  was carried away in the Spirit  and the solemn call to all persons concerned is frequently repeated  He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches  Rev ii  To all this we may add that the personal inherency of the  Spirit  in the essence of the Godhead is demonstrable from St  Paul  's illustration of a passage just now quoted from him  The Spirit  says he  searcheth all things yea the  deep things of God For what man  continues he  knoweth the things of a man save the Spirit of man which is in him Even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God  If the conscious spirit in man is man the  Spirit  of God must be essentially God  I desire to observe yet farther that nothing less than a belief in the doctrine of the  Trinity  as it is received in the Church can satisfy the full demands of the terms  faith  and  mystery  which we meet with so repeatedly in the New Testament and to which there is so much reference under the old The whole of the  mystery  of the divine  will made known in the dispensation of the fulness of times  Ephes i  the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world  c  Cor ii  or if you please the real character of the universal Saviour who was to be both God and man was a secret from the beginning This stupendous doctrine was infinitely and by the divine intention too sublime for the carnal conceptions of the  Jews  who whatever they might ultimately understand by or hope from the  Messiah  promised to  Adam  to  Abraham  to the  Patriarchs  and to others and foretold by the Prophets in language clear and strong indeed but at the same time figurative magnificent and mysterious expected and primarily desired only a temporal deliverer who should  restore again  and perpetuate  the kingdom to Israel  Nay it is abundantly evident that the Prophets themselves those  holy men of God who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost  Pet i  had not an insight into the full scope and whole import of the sacred truths and oracles which they delivered Our Lord seems to allude to this ignorance when he acquaints his disciples that  many prophets and kings had desired to see the things  which they saw and  had not seen them  Luke x  c It is true this was said by way of anticipation because as will be shewn it was not then even to them  given  to  know  the capital  mystery of the kingdom of heaven  But St  Peter  is plain and full upon this subject when speaking in his first general epistle of the salvation obtained  for us by  Jesus Christ  he proceeds in the following words  of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into  Pet i  The expressions here are I think in themselves almost sufficiently decisive upon the great point before us For it is hard to conceive that the Prophets in whom it seems the  Spirit of Christ  resided and much harder that the angels should not have a clear idea of the work of human redemption should not be  able to comprehend what is the breadth and length and depth and height  as St  Paul  expresses himself with an eye I imagine  to this dispensation supposing that work to have been accomplished by any person less than  very God  but admit the Divinity of  Jesus Christ  and the inquisitiveness and the incapacity of men and angels will by no means be unaccountable All this I trust will afford a most strong argument that the  faith  which the Apostles preached after the ascension of our Saviour the  faith  which was first  delivered  to the christian  Saints  the  faith  which we are required to  hold fast without wavering  Heb x  and to  build up ourselves upon  Jude  is a  faith  in the incarnation of the  eternal Son of God  or in other words in the doctrine of the  Holy Trinity  as it has all along been held in the Christian Church In consequence of the removal of a popular objection against all this I hope in the ensuing disquisitions to set in a still clearer point of view the great doctrine before us  DISCOURSE III  ACTS I  By many infallible proofs  THESE words immediately refer to the great event of our Lord's resurrection but in consequence of it to the divinity of his person Of this therefore I shall proceed to lay more proofs before you taking first this opportunity to obviate the following popular objection that notwithstanding all that has been or can be advanced the doctrine before us is not so absolutely clear and indisputable as we would have it thought and as a fundamental article of faith ought to be in as much as no text can be produced which precisely and  totidem verbis  speaks the language of the first article of our Church  viz  in the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one substance power and eternity the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost or of the second two whole and perfect natures that is to say the Godhead and Manhood are joined together in one Person never to be divided whereof is one Christ very God and very man or of the fifth the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son is of one substance majesty and glory with the Father and the Son very and eternal God  To all this I apprehend we may readily reply that if there be any real force in such objections it will operate much farther by necessary consequence than the objectors themselves can be supposed to desire it should For it will supply the perverse or idle caviller with pretences and exceptions against all the divine properties and attributes as far as they are asserted in the first article There is no  one  passage in the Scripture  which literally tells us that  there is but one living and true God everlasting without body parts or passions of infinite power wisdom and goodness the Maker and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible  The divine superintendency c usually called  Providence  is justly reputed one of the capital doctrines of religion Yet upon the principles of these objectors it should be no doctrine at all For we meet with no such term as  Providence  in the sense demanded either in the  old  or  new  Testament So that this doctrine must inevitably fall to the ground unless it be maintained and supported by natural inference or unless we are at liberty to make use of a proper term to express our sense of it He who objects to the term  Trinity  as unscriptural should consider by what texts he will undertake to prove the  Unity  of the Divine Nature which in the sense required by his argument is a term no more to be found in Scripture than the other In fact upon the principle of our opponents we shall be under a necessity of expunging a  great part of the Apostles Creed and even such parts of it as all Christians whatever without the least scruple or hesitation have assented to For I desire to know by what express or literal authority of Scripture any person believes in the  Holy Catholic Church  or in the  Communion of Saints  or that our blessed Lord was  born of the Virgin Mary or suffered under Pontius Pilate  c In short if we are to be absolutely precluded the use and application of proper terms and expressions in the investigation and exposition of Scripturemeaning it will I presume be impossible to frame the most simple system or formulary of Christian faith and doctrine or any such thing as a  Creed  of any kind in the Church The holy Scripture is the sole rule or measure of every form of confession c it is the only test by which any doctrine or system is in all its branches even the most minute of them to be deliberately and ultimately tried but it is not the rule itself and indeed a little inquiry will shew us why the capital points of religion are not systematically delivered in the sacred writings  The doctrine of the  Holy Trinity  as maintained by the Church of  England  was the doctrine of the Catholic Church at and before the time of the publication of the Scriptures of the  New Testament  or it was not If it was the controversy is at an end If it was not we would fain know how to account for that great variety of passages and those numerous circumstances by which it is at least so plausibly countenanced not to say forcibly defended We would fain know how to reconcile with the character of the  meek  and the  lowly  Jesus any one of his expressions which is capable of being construed into a claim to the Divinity If this doctrine was the doctrine of the Church previously to the publication of the holy writings they are sufficiently full and explicit for the satisfaction or confirmation of Christians of all ages if otherwise here is more than enough said to perplex and misguide them and to lead them into errors of the first magnitude The great question therefore I take it is whether we have not all the reason in the world to infer from the very mode in which the  doctrine of the  Trinity  is inserted and inculcated in the sacred pages the question I say is whether we are not authorised by this circumstance to conclude that this doctrine was antecedently received in the Christian world For instance supposing the doctrine of the  Trinity  to have been the standing doctrine of the Church when St  John k  wrote his Gospel we have no kind of difficulty to encounter but are we not very much embarassed by the contrary supposition In the former case we may readily conceive the Apostle to be asserting the Divinity of  Jesus Christ  in the most express terms at the beginning of his Gospel and in the course of it to record many particulars clearly declarative of the same not by way of formal answer to  Cerinthus  or any other heretic that disputed or denied it but purely in flat contradiction to the novel and heterodox notions advanced and propagated by them and to encourage and stablish good Christians in the faith as they had all along been taught What this great Evangelist declares at the latter end of his Gospel  viz  that  these things were written  or as we may say given under his own hand that the Christians whom he addresses  might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God  is perfectly consistent with their preacquaintance with these matters Agreably hereunto and indeed in direct confirmation of our hypothesis St  Luke  and many it seems before him  set in order a declaration of those things which most surely were believed among Christians  Luke i  that the person he writes to  might know the certainty of those things wherein  he had  been instructed  In the same light we may regard those passages in the epistles which have often been produced in vindication of the doctrine before us Some of these epistles were with respect to the main end and design of them entirely of a temporary nature being written with a view to the decision of controversies in the primitive Church which for many centuries have been out of date and upon several occasions and subjects of little moment to succeeding generations Not one of them however was professedly written  in defence of the doctrine of the  Trinity  According to our present hypothesis a vindication of this kind had been absolutely superfluous and though we cannot wonder to observe a point of this consequence frequently mentioned or alluded to in these writings yet it would be very unreasonable to expect to find it methodically or systematically taught  The grand principle of the leading oppugners of the doctrine under consideration is that the only thing required of Christians to be believed with regard to the Person of  Jesus Christ  is that he was the  Messiah  the Person promised and sent by God to redeem men from that death which they were inevitably appointed to as descendants of  Adam  and that the  Messiah  and the  Christ  and the  king of Israel  and the  Son of God  are terms or titles in Scripture absolutely denoting one and the same thing I need not tell you that this is the favourite tenet of Mr  Locke  in his treatise on the  Reasonableness of Christianity  as delivered in Scripture  Now we shall willingly admit that the Apostles themselves were believers under this idea mostly during our Saviour's residence upon earth as 'tis certain they had not the whole  mystery  of the Divine  Will  the grand scheme of man's redemption clearly and fully made known to them before our Lord's Ascension into heaven  I have many things to say unto you  he says to them  but ye cannot bear them now  John xvi  c and in saying this he had most probably an eye to the  mystery  of the Gospel For though he took frequent occasions to assert and presignify as I may say his truly Divine Nature either directly or by necessary implication and could not but have been understood so to have done by his disciples and by the  Jews  who  sought to stone him  on that very account yet  in the days of his flesh  many circumstances concurred to shake or rather to overturn the faith of his followers with respect to this great article This is plain enough from the tenor of the evangelical history It would be ridiculous to suppose that the Apostles could believe their Master to be the  Son of  God  in the highest sense or even to be the  redeemer of Israel  in any sense when  they all forsook him and fled  At the melancholy crisis I refer to they conceived no doubt very different notions of their Lord from what they had once entertained of him and afterwards did when he was  declared to be the Son of God with power  or to full effect by his  resurrection from the dead  Rom i  The fact is the scheme of human redemption by  Jesus Christ  the  onlybegotten Son of God  in the strictest sense was opened gradually and propounded to the world as it were article by article At first it must necessarily have been sufficient to have believed that  Jesus  was the  Christ  the  Messiah  or the  Son of God  merely as executing a divine commission c his resurrection ascension and exaltation to the  right hand of the Majesty on high  being subsequent points of faith and accordingly we read of many that  believed on him  at different times and in different places long before the conversion of  the  three thousand on the day of Pentecost  whom we cannot but consider as believers in a much higher sense The  faith  of Christians at that memorable period and ever since cannot with the least colour of reason be ascertained or is to be measured by what is declared to be  faith  in particular instances recorded in the Gospels The  faith  which  made the woman whole  who  had an issue of blood  Luke viii  and the  faith  that  saved  i e restored to sight the  blind man  near  Jericho  Ibid xviii  could not be that  faith  the  mystery  of which St  Paul  requires  Deacons to hold in a pure conscience  Tim iii  In short our Saviour's actual resurrection by virtue of his own as well as his Father's power as we shall presently see cleared up a thousand difficulties in a moment and amounted to a full demonstration of his Divinity From a thorough conviction of this no doubt it was that his Disciples  worshipped him  and St  Thomas  in particular burst into that rapture of acknowlegement  My Lord and my God  Though therefore the  Messiah  or the  Christ  be not  unfrequently called the  Son of God  as a person  sent from God  as a  teacher  a  prophet  or deliverer c as many even created beings angels c and men in general are called  Sons of God  in certain respects yet we insist that this appellation belongs peculiarly to  Jesus  the  author of our faith  as a Divine Person likewise and that he is so called with reference to his nature as well as to his offices In some passages of Scripture perhaps the precise import of this title may be controvertible as when  devils  and  unclean spirits  call our Saviour the  Son of God  and the  Holy One of God  and when  Peter  styles him the  Son of the living God  In answer to our Lord's question  whom say ye that I am  the disciples according to St  Mark  replied by the mouth of  Peter thou art the Christ  In other places the significance of the title in question is discoverable by the context as when  Nathaniel  addresses our Saviour in the character of the  Son of God  the  king of Israel  But why must all this affect the sense of any one passage wherein the appellation is given for reasons infinitely superiour  The  Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God  Luke i  l  Could stronger terms be devised to express the assumption of the human nature by the Divine Is it not perfectly reasonable to conclude that the sacred penmen often make mention of the  Son of God  with an eye to this mysterious and ineffable incarnation And is it not certain that the person whom St  John  at the end of his Gospel calls the  Christ  the  Son of God  is the same with him whom at the beginning of it he styles the  Word  that  was with God  and  was God  And if so is not the sense of the latter passage determinable by the preceding Nevertheless the great Philosopher above mentioned leaves the introduction to this Gospel and other passages in it of equal import entirely unnoticed as though it had no connection with his argument which is a piece of disingenuousness that one cannot avoid saying did little credit to his cause or to himself  We shall be enabled by such considerations as these to put the true construction on the title of the  Son of God  in most if not all the places where it occurs in the Epistles naturally taking into the account the many clear and express proofs of our Lord's Divinity which are cited from them Of some of the most striking of these proofs among other particulars we shall for satisfactionsake take a review in proper time What Mr  Locke  has adduced on this subject with a purpose to invalidate these proofs in general will I am confident be utterly overthrown by the force of the following considerations  viz  that the  Epistles  are a part of the  New Tesment  and as essential a part as the Gospels were like them as was observed written occasionally and after our Saviour's  Ascension  c that St  Paul  e g was as much a  teacher  of the  Gospel  an inspired  Apostle  as St  Matthew  or any other Apostle who has historically recorded the actions words or doctrine of  Jesus Christ  and that a  Creed  or system of faith should have its foundation in these  Epistles  together with the other Scriptures  The truth is St  John  in his  Epistles  assérts the same doctrine of our Lord's Divinity as in his Gospel By Mr  Locke's  way of proceeding  viz  arbitrarily admitting or rejecting Scripture we may mould Christianity into what form we please and to this way of proceeding among other causes we are to ascribe the various Schisms and Heresies which have so long and so deplorably divided the Christian world  We may now I imagine fairly date the reception of the doctrine of our Lord's Divinity from his resurrection and we will next see whether the subsequent accounts we have of the propagation of the Gospel be not entirely uniform and consistent upon this hypothesis at the same time that they open to us the whole  Trinitarian  system  Let it be observed then that the first recorded prayer we meet with is that of the Apostles after the  Ascension  in which the address is made immediately to our Lord himself that he would be pleased to  shew  whether he had  chosen Joseph or Matthias  to supply the place vacated by  Judas  the  traitor  whom he had originally chosen with the  eleven Apostles Thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  Acts i  It is I believe generally agreed that this address was made to  Jesus Christ  and if so this attribution of omniscience to him is sure as strong an argument of his Divinity as any one thing which can be produced in demonstration of it The ascription is to me on any other foot unaccountable It is indeed true that the Apostles had not yet a thorough insight into the evangelical mystery nor had got perfectly clear of the prejudices and notions respecting the  Messiah  which they had imbibed in common with their countrymen in consequence of which we find them asking our Lord even after his resurrection and after he had spoken to them more or less explicitly of the  things pertaining to the kingdom of God  whether he would  at that time restore again the kingdom to Israel  But that they put this question to  him as to one who was able to effect such restoration by his own inherent divine power or in other words essentially partook of the divine nature must surely be concluded from this consideration that they could not possibly  now  entertain the least doubt but that all his declarations and assurances to them would be verified to a tittle and that as he  came forth from the Father and was come into the world  so he would soon  leave the world and go to the Father and be glorified with that glory which he had with the Father before the world was  The case appears plainly to have been this they did not yet comprehend the whole evangelical plan in the concurrence of three Divine Persons in "glory equal in majesty coeternal" they did not perfectly conceive all the  things pertaining  to Christ's spiritual kingdom the  kingdom of God  in the fullest and most exalted sense of which he had been speaking to them allusively  forty days  and with regard to which he may be supposed to have before promised them that the  spirit of truth whom  he would  send unto them from the Father  should  guide them into  ALL truth and  testify of him  Accordingly after the miraculous effusion of the  Holy Ghost  on the  day of Pentecost  we find them discovering very different sentiments and animated with spiritual expectations we see them calling upon the people to  save  themselves from an  untoward generation  exhorting them to  repent  and to be  baptized for the remission of sins m  renouncing in an instant all honours profits and pleasures of this world  rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame  for the  name  of their Divine Master and in a word preaching the Gospel of  Jesus Christ  the  Son of God  through the inspiration of the  Spirit  and in the truest sense of the expression On the memorable day just mentioned we are told that the  Apostles were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance  What they spake is not particularly specified but in general we are given to understand that they spake in all languages the  wonderful works of God  On the credit of what has been advanced which will be strengthned by what will follow it  is most reasonable to suppose that by the  works  here referred to the great work of redemption by the eternal  Son of God  is principally intended the  mystery of godliness  exhibited in  God manifest in the flesh  and displayed in the wonderful effusion of the  Holy Ghost  In the first address of the Apostles to the  Jews  and  Jewish proselytes  by the mouth of  Peter  on the same day both the humanity and divinity of our Saviour are plainly and distinctly asserted or implied and in such a manner as hardly to be liable to misconstruction The doctrine of the resurrection of  Jesus Christ  considered as the confirmation of a still greater doctrine that of his Divinity is the chief  cornerstone  of our Christian Faith and as such is particularly insisted upon by the Apostles who were  ordained  to be  witnesses  of it And because this most important of all events could not be accomplished by himself in his mere human capacity we find the holy writers frequently declaring that  God raised him from the dead  But  let it be remembered that  Jesus whom God raised up  is likewise as expressly said to have  risen  and is styled by these very witnesses the  Holy One  and the  Just  and the  Prince of life  in different places which beyond all doubt are titles appertaining to the Supreme God Under the first of these characters God the Creator is described in numberless passages of the  Old Testament  and he who is the  Prince  or author of  life  according to the marginal reading must be the same in point of power and perogative with him to whom belong the  issues from death  who  killeth and maketh alive  and  in whose hand is the life of every thing  Indeed the  Prince  or Author of  life  must have  life in himself  from all eternity must be emphatically  the life  and  resurrection  as our Saviour calls himself and therefore may as truly and properly be said to have  raised the temple of his body  by his own power to borrow his own phrase as to have been  raised from the dead  by the power of  God the Father  We may say in short with equal truth and propriety  Christ was raised from the dead  or  Christ rose from the  dead according to the Scriptures  the latter assertion importing his Divinity the former not superseding it and therefore when St  Peter  told the  men of Israel  that they had  killed the Prince of life  I scarce know which strikes us most the force of the implied truth or the keenness of the sarcasm But to return to the address of the Apostles  Peter standing up with the eleven  says the sacred historian  lift up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose c but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy  c and I  will shew wonders c and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved  Acts ii  Now let us compare the promulgation or delivery of this prophecy with the completion of it at this period Observe the words of the Apostle in  the course of his harange  This Jesus  says he whom with reference to his humanity he had just before called  a man approved  by God  hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost  HE  hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear  That the  Father  and the  Son  concurred in this wonderful dispensation of infinite wisdom and power on an equal foot it will scarce be possible for us to doubt when we recollect that the  second Person  in the blessed  Trinity  is often represented as the giver of  spiritual gifts  independently on any  promise  from or association with the  first I will give you a mouth  says he to his Apostles just before his passion  and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay I am with you always  says he after his resurrection  even unto the end of the world  Matt xxviii  Without  him he tells them they  can do nothing  And to produce only one passage more out of many that might be cited which has a manifest  allusion to the effusion of the  Spirit  on the  day of Pentecost  St  Paul  assures the  Ephesians  that  unto every one is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Wherefore  he adds  he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men  Ephes iv Cor vii  It may be pertinent yet farther to remark that sometimes neither the  Father  nor the  Son  appear to be concerned in this matter the  Spirit  being said of and by himself to  divide  his  gifts  and graces  to every man severally as he will  But what shall we say to the invocation implied in the close of the prophecy we are considering  whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved  Whom are we to understand by the  Lord  here This I should think may be determined by the significance of the same words in other places They cannot be misunderstood in the original prophecy of  Joel  And if we refer to the tenth Chapter of St  Paul's  Epistle to the  Romans  where they occur again they will amount  to an irresistible though indirect proof of the point in question It is apparent that  Jesus Christ  is intended or included however in all these texts is accordingly to be worshipped and consequently is God  After what has been said we shall not be at a loss for the construction to be put upon the inference with which the Apostle concludes this first discourse which we have been remarking on  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ  Just noting that in the phrase  that same Jesus  abundance of reproach is conveyed I observe that these words sufficiently express the two natures united in our blessed Saviour the  Christ  in his human character the  Lord  in his divine But yet farther the Apostle encourages his auditors who it seems were  pricked  in the heart by what he had preached to them to  repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ  with the comfortable assurance that the  promise of the Holy Ghost was unto them and to their  Children and to all that are afar off even as many as the  LORD OUR GOD should  call  Agreably to which declaration we are told that  the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved  and are afterwards informed that  believers were added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women  Now that according to the most natural and obvious interpretation we are by the  Lord  to understand  Jesus Christ  in the two last quoted places I presume will be admitted by every candid enquirer and if so it is he who is described under the character of the  Lord our God  in the text immediately before cited When therefore we are told at the d verse of this Chapter that the newlybaptized converts  continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine  and afterwards that the  Apostles taught and preached Jesus Christ  and spake to  the people the words of this life  c we may justly conclude that doctrine to have been the doctrine of redemption as it has since been received in the Christian Church  When St  Peter  and his colleagues were brought before the  HighPriest and Rulers  c in order to be examined concerning the cure of the  impotent  man at the  beautiful gate of the Temple  we find them again insisting on the  resurrection  of their Master as the fundamental article which was demonstrative of the truth of his mission and doctrine and by consequence of the Divinity of his Person This  deceiver  as they had blasphemously reputed him had  said while he was yet alive  that  after three days he would rise again  he had affirmed to them that  as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he will  he had declared to them his existence before  Abraham  in the most explicit terms  Before Abraham was I am  he had  said that God was his Father  in the strictest sense  making himself equal with God  c c Supposing then  the Lord to have risen indeed  the truth of these several assertions must necessarily follow And in fact that he was  risen  these  betrayers  and  murderers  of the  just one  had they not been  stiffnecked  and  uncircumcised in heart and ears  could not but have been convinced by  beholding the lame man who was  healed standing before them  and afterwards by the many  signs  and  wonders  which were  wrought among the people by the hands of the Apostles  who most undoubtedly must have been  endowed with  such  power from on high  or in other words by their now  glorified  Master  I have already in effect considered the sin of  Ananias  and  Sapphira  who  agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord  as a sin against the  Third  Person in the Holy  Trinity  and I think we may defy infidelity to put a fairer interpretation upon this portion of the Apostolical history  I shall not dwell on the two invocations of the protomartyr at the hour of death  Lord Jesus receive my Spirit Lord lay not this sin to their charge  both which abundantly imply his faith in  Jesus Christ  as God but pass on to the account of the conversion of the  Ethiopian Eunuch  by  Philip  the  Deacon  Acts viii c  The Angel of the Lord spake unto Philip  saying arise and go toward the South c and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia an Eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians c who had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his▪ chariot read Esaias the prophet Then the Spirit said to Philip go near c And Philip ran to him and heard him read c and said understandest thou what thou readest And he said how can I except some man should guide me And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him The place c which he read was this He was led as a sheep to the slaughter c And the Eunuch said I pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this Then Philip began at the same Scripture and preached unto him Jesus And as they went on their way they came to a certain water and the Eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized And Philip said if thou believest with all thy heart thou mayest And he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God And he baptized him  The history is as succinct as possible but why is it not as reasonable  to suppose that when  Philip preached unto the Eunuch Jesus  he laid the whole mystery of Christianity before him the grand scheme of human Salvation and consequently that he believed  Jesus Christ  to be the eternal  Son of God  as that when he  baptized him  he did so  in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost  There was no manner of occasion to be more circumstantial supposing the primitive readers of this history to have believed in our sense of the term  The next particular that meets us is the conversion of St  Paul  It will be proper to lay it before you  Acts ix c  Saul yet breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the highpriest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the Synagogues that if he found any of this way he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem And as he journeyed suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him  Saul Saul why persecutest thou me And he said who art thou Lord And the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks And he trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me to do And the Lord said Arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee and Saul arose and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him and brought him into Damascus And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision Ananias And he said behold I am here Lord And the Lord said Arise and go into the street which is called strait and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight Then Ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name But the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me And  Ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said Brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost And he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God But all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ  Upon this compendious narrative I remark first that throughout the whole we must understand bythe  LordJesus Christ  secondly that whether  Saul  received the  Holy Ghost  by virtue of the imposition of the hands of  Ananias  and previously to his baptism or after it in either case the whole  mystery of the Gospel  must have been communicated to him by immediate irradiation and thirdly that therefore when  he preached Christ in the Synagogues that he is  the Son of God  he asserted him so to be by eternal generation Occasionally indeed when he  confounded the Jews  by proving  that this is very Christ  his argument no doubt turned upon what he alledged to shew that  Jesus Christ  was the true  Messiah  the  prophet that should come into the world  and the  king of Israel  in a spiritual sense whom they had and did expect under the idea of a temporal Saviour It seems after this  Saul spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus at Jerusalem  and we are told that upon his being  sent forth to Tarsus  that he might be out of the reach of the  Grecians  who  went about to slay him the Churches had rest throughout all Judea c and were edified and walking in the  FEAR OF THE LORD  and in the  COMFORT OF THE HOLY GHOST  were multiplied  I recommend the two last particulars of this passage to the attention of every candid and intelligent hearer I add too in corroboration of what has been offered under this portion of the history that as  Jesus Christ  here tells  Ananias  that  Saul  was  a chosen vessel unto  HIM so  Ananias  tells  Paul  according to the latter's account of  this transaction in another place that the GOD OF THEIR FATHERS had  chosen  him  Acts xxii x c  The conversion of  Cornelius  and his family presents itself next to our consideration and the short but important narrative of it is pregnant with matter to our purpose This  proselyte  of the  gates  for such doubtless he was  saw evidently an Angel of  GOD  coming unto him  c To the  voice  which called to  Peter  to  rise kill and eat  he answered  not so  LORD  for I have never eaten any thing that is common c While Peter thought on the vision the  SPIRIT  said unto him Behold three men seek thee arise therefore and go with them nothing doubting for I have sent them  GOD  hath shewed me  says he afterwards to  Cornelius  and his friends that  I should not call any man common  c Now if we only suppose as I think we can do no less than suppose that St  Peter  addresses  Jesus Christ  in the words  not so Lord  we have plainly a distinction of  three  Persons in the sacred story The same will be observable likewise in the  harangue of the Apostle upon this extraordinary occasion  Of a truth I perceive that  GOD  is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him c is accepted with him The word which  GOD  sent unto the children of Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ  HE IS LORD OF ALL  that word I say you know which was published throughout all Judea how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the  HOLY GHOST  and with power  c However if it be objected that it is by no means credible this devout  proselyte  and his family should be converted to the Christian Faith in the  trinitarian  sense by any thing asserted or intimated in St  Peter  's discourse to them we will admit the objection and leave our adversaries in possession of all the advantage they can make of it We may venture to do so without the least hesitation for I desire it may be remembered in what manner and by whom the Apostle was interrupted in his sermon if it may be called one  While Peter yet spake these words  says the sacred writer  the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word And they of the  circumcision were astonished for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God  By this miraculous event therefore all farther endeavours of the Apostle for the instruction of these people were happily superseded they were as St  Paul  was instantaneously as it were  guided into all truth  and became believers in the same sense in which he was one Agreeably hereunto when St  Peter rehearsed  this matter and  expounded it by order to those of the circumcision who contended with him  he tells them in the course of his narration that  as he  BEGAN  to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them  that heard him After this would it not be idle to insist upon the inadequateness of St  Peter  's address to the purpose of conversion in its utmost extent  We read in the sequel of this and in the following chapters that the  word was preached  that the  hand of the Lord was with these preachers  that  a great number believed and turned unto the Lord and that the word of God grew and multiplied  If these expressions are compared with others similar to  them in this history and with several already cited they will be found I presume abundantly to coincide with our hypothesis or more properly to confirm it  But the time admonishes me to bespeak your attention to the continuation of my argument at the next opportunity  DISCOURSE IV  ACTS I  By many infallible proofs  IN prosecution of the subject which engaged us last  Sunday  I proceed to the account of St  Peter  's imprisonment and what followed upon it which the sacred Historian gives us in the th chapter of the  Acts of the Apostles  When  Peter  was  put in prison by Herod  it seems  prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him  Acts xii  and on the night before his intended execution  the Lord  we find  sent his angel and delivered him out  of the hand of Herod  c Now that  Jesus Christ  was  the Lord that sent his angel  appears evident enough from these considerations  Jesus Christ  is manifestly designed by this title for the most part at least through this whole history  The Lord who delivered Peter by his angel  was certainly the same  Lord  who afterwards spake to  Paul in the night by a vision  and who upon another occasion  stood  by the same Apostle and encouraged him c Now we should be glad to know why these particulars are not to be regarded as equivalent to the appearances and visions and deliverances  See Dan iii and chap vi  which are so frequent in the  Old Testament  and in that case I need not point out the consequences they lead to  In the following chapter we see  Barnabas  and  Saul sent forth  by an immediate commission from the  Holy Ghost The Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them  Acts xiii  So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed  unto Seleucia c  The passage has been introduced before and I leave it to the consideration of every attentive and impartial hearer  The next occurrence is the conversion of the  Deputy S Paulus  who we are informed was a  prudent man  and  called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God  And we may reasonably suppose that our Apostles preached it to him at large and laid before him the great mysteries of the Gospel and that he  believed  in the most extensive sense and was confirmed in his faith by the judgment which he saw miraculously inflicted by the  hand of the Lord  upon  Elymas the sorcerer  being as the sacred text expresses it  astonished at the doctrine of the Lord  the doctrine just above styled the  word of God  After this we find St  Paul  preaching in the  synagogue  of the  Jews  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia  Acts xiii c  Now these  Jews  though they were  not immediately concerned with them that dwelt at  Jerusalem  in the proceedings against our blessed Lord were yet in all probability  consenting unto his death  as they could not all this while be unacquainted with his story or strangers to his pretensions The Apostle therefore adopts the same mode of argumentation which St  Peter  had used before in his speech to the council and lays the main stress on the fundamental article of the resurrection of our Lord from the dead From the admission of this the truth of the other great points of Christianity must necessarily follow And it should seem that this discourse of our Apostle had a considerable effect upon some of his audience and indeed that others conceived the full force and import of the most striking particulars in it for we read that  when the congregation was broken up  many of the  Jews  and religious  proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God  And by the way this circumstance may well be thought to imply that the  Spirit of grace  had previously  operated in their hearts to their entire conversion But the  next sabbath day  we are farther told  almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God  and the result was that the  Jews filled with envy spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming  I would just ask then whether this BLASPHEMY does not help us to a very strong presumptive proof of the sense in which these  Jews  understood  the things which were spoken  by the Apostle  Let us now attend  Paul  and  Barnabas  to  Iconium  and see whether we may not readily infer the nature of their doctrine from the success of it there In this place we are informed  they abode long time speaking boldly in the  LORD  which gave testimony to the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands  Acts xiv c c    I would desire you to compare the last clause of this passage with the conclusion of St  Mark  's  Gospel  so then after the  LORD  had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven c and they went forth and preached the  LORD  working with them and confirming the word with signs following  and with the twelfth verse of the next chapter  all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders  GOD  had wrought amongst the Gentiles by them  and with the following passage in the Epistle to the  Hebrews how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the  LORD  and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him  GOD  also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the  HOLY GHOST  according to his own will  Heb ii c    I say I could wish you to compare these several places and I believe I might venture to abide by the conclusions you will draw from them  We find our Apostles next at  Lystra  where  Paul  cured the man that was  impotent in his  feet  c  Acts xiv c  on the sight of which miracle  the people lift up their voices saying the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men  Possessed with this notion the  priests  of  Jupiter brought oxen  and would  have done sacrifice  c This no sooner came to the ears of  Barnabas  and  Paul than they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out sirs why do ye these things We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God which made heaven and earth  c c Now this was precisely the expostulation which the occasion demanded The existence of the one living and true God was to be asserted to these idolatrous believers in a plurality of deities At that time to have opposed to their persuasions doctrines peculiarly Christian would have been altogether premature and unseasonable It appears however that our Apostles had before and after this preached these doctrines at  Lystra  and in the neighbourhood with success though most probably for obvious reasons not in the  hearing of those that  would have done sacrifice  For we read at the sixth verse of this chapter that being  ware  of the design of the  Jews  and  Gentiles  at  Iconium to use them despitefully c they fled unto Lystra and Derbe  c and  there they preached the Gospel  And after the affair of the sacrifice we are told that  there came to Lystra certain Jews from Antioch who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul drew him out of the city  c that nevertheless he revived and soon after  preached the Gospel at Derbe and taught many and returned again to Lystra c confirming the souls of the Disciples and exhorting them to continue in the saith  Acts xvi  We meet with nothing now that hath particular connexion with our argument before the conversions related in the sixteenth chapter Let us proceed then to these At  Troas  says the history  a vision appeared to Paul in the night  from which he and  Silas assuredly gathered that the Lord had called them to preach the Gospel in Macedonia  Observe  then the account of the conversion of  Lydia  at  Philippi A certain woman named Lydia which worshipped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul And when she was baptized she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house  c Now I would ask whether we may not reasonably suppose the  Lord opened  this woman's  heart  for the reception of all evangelical truths almost in an instant Whether her case is not at least similar to that of  Cornelius  And whether we are not as much authorised to take it for granted that  the things which were spoken of Paul  were  the things pertaining to the kingdom of God  agreeably to our system as that this convert was baptized according to the form in St  Matthew  's Gospel I would just remark here that this system is in no wise prejudiced either by the declaration of the  damsel possessed with a spirit of diviniation  who  followed Paul  and his companions  and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high God which shew unto us the way of Salvation  or by the Apostle's exorcism of that spirit in the following words  I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her  But let us turn to the conversion of the jailor to whose custody  Paul  and  Silas  were committed at  Philippi Sirs what must I do to be saved  Acts xvi  is the question which the former in a fit of astonishment and terror put to the latter  And they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house And they spake unto him the word of the Lord c And he was baptized he and all his And he rejoiced believing in God with all his house To believe in God and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ  appear here to be convertible expressions In short I affirm that in this as well as in preceding instances we have good reason to suppose the persons preached to were made acquainted by the Apostle and his companion with the capital truths of Christianity as they are taught in the Church  Not long after this our Apostle and his fellowtravellers came to  Thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews  Acts xvii c  And Paul  as the narrative proceeds  went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alledging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again  and that  this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ And some of them believed  It will be sufficient to observe here that our Apostle dealt no doubt with these  Jews  and  Jewish  proselytes as he had before done with others on like occasions But the gross misrepresentation and scandalous calumny of the  unbelieving Jews  in the city just mentioned is extremely worth notice They drew  Jason  as we are informed and  certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these men that have turned the world upside down are come hither also  Ibid xvii  and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king one Jesus  Now it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that  Jason  and these  brethren  proclaimed their crucified  master king in a spiritual sense nay that they proclaimed him the sovereign of the universe  king of kings and lord of lords  but it is clear beyond a possibility of doubt that they asserted no temporal jurisdiction of  Jesus Christ  or said or did any thing  contrary to the decrees  or against the government of  Caesar  We have next an account of  Paul  and  Silas  's preaching the Gospel at  Berea  Acts xvii  but there is nothing in it which discriminates it from parallel ones already spoken to except the candid reception the Gospel met with at that place  We will therefore follow our Apostle to  Athens  where we find him  disputing in the synagogue with the Jews and others that met with him  Among these were  certain philosophers of the Epicureans and the Stoics who encountered him  some calling him a  babler  others  a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection  Acts xvii c  I mean not to insinuate from this passage that the Apostle is maintaining the Divinity of  Jesus Christ  as it is evident from the tenor of his ensuing discourse to those heathen philosophers which is set down at large that he has here only an eye to the prophetic character or office of our blessed Lord If you will turn to the discourse you will find the great points insisted on to be the unity and the spirituality of the Godhead together with the doctrine of a future state and the resurrection of  all  men from the dead in consequence of  his  whom God had  ordained  to be the judge of the world This was a proper beginning with heathens But what effect had this discourse upon these idolatrous philosophers  When they heard of the resurrection  continues the sacred story  some mocked  and others said  we will hear thee again howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed  c Our Apostle appears then to have made converts at  Athens  though we do not read that they were  baptized  or indeed believed in the fundamental  articles of Christianity according to our hypothesis Without doubt these articles the great mysteries of faith were gradually opened to them afterwards and previously to their admission into the church by baptism For we shall see presently that these converts are not the only instances of persons who were disciples or believers in a certain sense though they were uninstructed in the first principles of Christianity and this too even since the propagation of it by the Apostles  After these things we are told  Paul  and  Silascame to Corinth  Acts xviii c  and Paul reasoned in the synagogueand persuaded the Jews and Greeksand was pressed in spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads c  You will be pleased to compare this relation with that of the perverse and unbelieving  Jews at Antioch in Pisidia  already taken notice of  We have next an account of the conversion of  Justus  though it is not particularly set down and of  Crispus  and of  many of the Corinthians  which contains nothing material to our argument  But after this we readof an  insurrection made  by the  Jews against Paul  and of a charge brought against him before  Gallio  which has a particular worth our notice  This fellow  say they  persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law  Acts xviii  Now when we recollect that our blessed Saviour was  circumcised  and  obedient to the law for man  that himself and his Apostles conformed to the religion of their country in all points and attended divine service in the temple and in the synagogues that our Apostle circumcised  Timothy  in pure condescension to the  Jews  that in vindication of his innocence he declared to  Festus  as  he had done before in substance to  Felix  that  neither against the law of the Jews neither against the temple he had offended any thing at all  that the  Mosaic  oeconomy totally ceased not before the final destruction of  Jerusalem  when all disputes concerning circumcision and the legal rites and observances were happily terminated when we recollect all this to which more might be subjoined it will I conceive be impossible to make tolerable sense of the accusation just mentioned without supposing something to have been superadded to the  Jewish  worship by the Apostles and first Christians which gave this  great offence  and what should this be but the worship of Christians as such or in other words the adoration of Christ as God  We will now proceed to the account which the sacred historian gives us of  Apollos  in the same chapter  Acts xviii  A certain Jew named Apollos an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures came to Ephesus This man was  instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the Spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the Jews and that publickly shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ  This portion of Scripture though a little abstruse is replete with matter for our observation  Apollos  is here said to have been  mighty in the Scriptures  to have been  instructed in  THE WAY OF THE LORD and to have spoken and  taught diligently  the THINGS OF THE LORD i e beyond all controversy the  things of the Lord Jesus Christ  Nevertheless he is only called a  Jew  and why but because he was not baptized in the name of  Jesus Christ  He was not a Christian in the full sense of the term as we understand it  he  knew only the baptism of John  he knew as we cannot but suppose from this account of him he knew  Jesus Christ  to be the  prophet  the  Messiah that was to come  whose  way John  had  prepared  by  preaching the baptism of repentance  c but he knew not the whole  mystery of godliness  the grand secret of human redemption by the  Son of God  coexistent with his  Father before the foundation of the world  And accordingly we may safely conclude that it was with respect to this great mystery that  Aquila  and  Priscilla expounded to him the  WAY OF GOD  more perfectly  If we do not infer from hence that he expressly and directly preached the great mystery in question to those  Jews  whom he  mightily convinced  c every difficulty under this head is fairly solved by preceding considerations  The case of the disciples whom St  Paul  found at  Ephesus  is very similar to that we have just dispatched  Have ye received the Holy Ghost  says he  since ye believed And they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost  Acts xix c  And  he said unto them what then were ye baptized And they said unto John's baptism Then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus When they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied  The passage is not wholly free from obscurity but we cannot do less than collect from it that these  disciples  knew as much of  Christ Jesus  antecedently to this interview as  Apollos  did before his acquaintance with  Aquila  and  Priscilla  and consequently that when  they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus  they were baptized in the name of a greater person than a prophet and when the  Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied  had like  Cornelius  and his houshold an immediate insight into the profound mystery of the Christian faith I just add that in the chapter before us the  name of the Lord Jesus  is said to have been  magnified  and that the WORD OF THE LORD JESUS and the WORD OF GOD are different modes of expression which at first sight will be found to import one and the same thing  But to proceed I see nothing of consequence enough to our argument to detain us till we find St  Paul  at  Miletus  from whence he  sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the Church And when they were come to him  says the history  he said unto them ye know from the first day that I came into Asia after what manner I have been with you serving the  LORD  with all humility and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards  GOD and  faith toward our  LORD  Jesus Christ And now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me save that the  HOLY GHOST  witnesseth in every city saying that afflictions abide me But none of these things move me so that I might finish my course and the ministry which I have received of the  LORD  * Acts xx c  Jesus to testify the Gospel of the grace of  GOD  And now I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of  GOD  shall see my face no more Wherefore I take you to record that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you  ALL THE COUNSEL OF GOD  Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the  HOLY GHOST  hath made you overseers to feed the Church of  GOD  which he hath purchased with his  OWN BLOOD  For I know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them  Now if we suppose this Apostolical charge to have been delivered to persons preinstructed in the mystery of the Gospel agreeably to our representation of it i e to have been believers in the Holy Trinity it must be acknowleged to contain words of perspicuity  truth and soberness  but on every other supposition must not St  Paul  have been thought by his audience to have been indeed  beside himself  I would recommend  the whole of this passage to every judicious and impartial reader's thorough consideration  We will now attend this great Apostle to  Jerusalem  where we find him violently attacked by the  Jews which were of Asia who stirred up all the people and laid hands on him crying out men of Israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law  c The accusation brought here against our Apostle is plainly in substance the same with that alledged by the  Jews of Achaia  who accused him of  persuading men to worship God contrary to the law  I shall therefore refer you to what was said on that occasion Only I will add here that the observation then made is much confirmed by the circumstance of St  Paul  's  purifying  himself at  Jerusalem  with the  four men who had a vow on them  agreeably to the advice before given by the judaizing Christians and in exact conformity to the  Mosaic  constitution But if we turn to what the Apostle has to say in his own defence we shall find  * Acts xxi c  his apology to contain an account of his conversion and of his Apostolical commission in consequence of it which strengthens much what has been remarked relative to the charge brought against him It is observable that St  Paul  calls himself here a  Jew  in the very same breath almost in which he avows himself a Christian He admits his hearers to be  zealous towards God according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers  Acts xxii c  though he plainly intimates all the while that they were erroneously or blindly zealous or as he elsewhere expresses it that their  zeal of God was not according to knowlege  He does not undervalue or vilify the law and much less pronounce it to be  void  and of  none effect  though he professes himself a preacher of the Gospel Neither the  Jews  of  Jerusalem  nor those of  Asia  could possibly be strangers to the NEW DOCTRINE which he taught under that character so that we are not at a loss to know the nature and import of the testimony which he bore concerning his Divine Master Beside we are to remember that he was interrupted  in the course of his harangue and precluded from enlarging his speech or expatiating on his doctrine which otherwise perhaps he might have done by the clamours and outrage of a giddy and incensed multitude  We see him next before the  chief priests  and  council  in which situation he politicly takes advantage of the difference of sentiment between them that composed it the  one part  being  Sadducees  and  the other Pharisees  The Apostle openly declares himself a  Pharisee  in which plea his immediate view was manifestly to his own preservation though ultimately he had doubtless an eye to the conversion of the most considerable and respectable part of his audience by tacitly at least referring to the resurrection of  Jesus Christ  and the important consequences necessarily resulting from it  In much the same light we may regard his apology for himself before  Felix  in the  † Acts xxiii c  following Chapter Under one article of his accusation he is charged with being  a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes  Acts xxiv c  or as the  Asiatic Jews  had expressed themselves with  teaching men every where against the law  or in the words of the  Jews  of  Achaia  with  persuading men to worship God contrary to the law  and under another article he is traduced as a  mover of Sedition  and a disturber of the public peace Now there is something observably dexterous in our Apostle's reply to all this in which he partly denies the charge professes his innocence and defies them to  prove the things whereof they accuse him  and partly asserts the cause he had espoused and in general terms acknowleges his Christian principles In this as in the preceding case there is fine address in the Apostle's endeavour to interest his auditors on the side of Christianity by representing its professors as holding one common tenet with the  straitest  and most popular sect of the  Jewish  religion while at the same time he was indirectly  preaching through Jesus the  resurrection from the dead  and by necessary implication maintaining the great mystery of the Christian Faith  Felix  we find was far from being unacquainted with at least some of the doctrines of Christianity and reserved the matter for a farther hearing but in the interim he with his wife  Drusilla which was a Jewess  sent for  Paul  privately and  heard him concerning the faith in Christ  Acts xxiv c  It does not appear that our Apostle on this occasion discoursed on any one article of faith strictly and peculiarly Christian  He reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come  till this iniquitous governor  trembled  and probably had proceeded to the full display of all evangelical truth had he not been abruptly dismissed However if there be any difficulty here it is such as affects not our argument in particular because the very same difficulty will subsist whether we suppose  that Jesus whom Paul preached  to be "very God of very God" or to be the  Son of God  in a secondary sense only or indeed barely the  prophet that was to come into the world  Many of the foregoing remarks may be applied to the defence made afterwards by our Apostle before king  Agrippa and Festus  Acts xxvi c  I think it unnecessary therefore to cite it It will suffice to observe or rather to repeat that asserting the doctrine of the resurrection in general and particularly that of  Jesus Christ  St  Paul  at one and the same time insinuates himself into the good graces of such as were pharisaically disposed and points to a fact the admission of which upon full and dispassionate enquiry must lead all that heard him all the  Jews  at least into a train of conclusions necessarily comprehending the great truths of the Gospel And that this was a much more judicious mode of conviction than the direct or positive assertion of all or any of those truths could have been I presume I need not stay to prove  When St  Paul  some time after this  expounded and testified the kingdom of God to the Jews at Rome persuading them concerning Jesus both out of the law of Moses and out of the  prophets  Acts xxviii  we cannot say with any precision how much of the whole scheme of Christianity he laid before them Most probably his usual discretion directed him to deal tenderly with them at first though when he declared to the unbelieving part of them that the  salvation of God was sent unto the Gentiles  the expression has evident reference to that scheme as suitably hereto the history of the  Apostolical Acts  concludes with an account of his  receiving all that came in unto him for two whole years and preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ  This minute and circumstantial survey of the history of the  Acts of the Apostles  so far as it is connected with our present subject will I apprehend throw much light upon the same And it will receive additional lustre from the following consideration that as in the Holy Scriptures so in the writings of the Apostolical Fathers the leading truths of Christianity are incidentally mentioned or  alluded to and not systematically but uniformly taught The doctrine of these Fathers is delivered in the spirit of simplicity it appears plainly to have been the standing doctrine of the Church nor is there a single circumstance that will incline us to suspect them of a design to obtrude their own private opinions or conceits upon the Christian world This to me seems demonstrable from a very observable particular which is that in their writings they do not cite all or the principal texts which are adduced in maintenance of the doctrine of the Trinity but assert the same in other terms and in language fully equivalent They evidently considered it not as requiring proof but deserving illustration  Ignatius  in the introduction to his Epistle to the  Ephesians  salutes them  according to the will of the Father and  Jesus Christ our  GOD  The same Father wishes the  Romans  to  permit him to imitate the passion of his GOD  or of  Christ  his GOD as it stands in the Original In the abovementioned Epistle to the  Ephesians  he takes occasion thus to express himself  There is one physician both fleshly and spiritual made and not made GOD INCARNATE true life in death both of  Mary  and of God first passible then impassible even  Jesus Christ  our Lord  n  In the conclusion of his Epistle to the  Magnesians  he injoins them to  be subject to their bishop as  Jesus Christ  to the Father according to the flesh  Romans i  and the Apostles both to Christ and to the Father and to the Holy Ghost  This inversion is a very remarkable one In his Epistle to  Polycarp  he exhorts him  to consider the times and expect him who is above all time eternal invisible c  Were there occasion much more to the same purpose might be extracted from this venerable Father  Polycarp  in his Epistle to the  Philipians  wishes them to be  subject to the Priests c as unto God and Christ  In St  Clement  's first epistle to the  Corinthians  these passages occur  The sceptre of  the majesty of GOD our Lord  Jesus Christ  came not in the shew of pride  c c The second section of the same epistle proceeds in the terms following  Ye were all of you humbleminded c desiring rather to be subject than to govern c being content with the portion GOD had dispensed to you and hearkening diligently to HIS word ye were enlarged in your bowels having HIS SUFFERINGS always before your eyes  This passage is not unsimilar to part of St  Paul  's discourse at  Miletus  to the elders of the church of  Ephesus  before submitted to your consideration Let us see now what this Father says in his other epistle to the Corinthians The exordium of it is this  Brethren we ought so to think of  Jesus Christ  as of GOD c  In the third paragraph he quotes these words of our blessed Saviour  Whosoever shall confess me before men him will I confess before my Father  But continues he  Wherein must we confess him Namely in doing those things which he saith c by worshipping him not with our lips only but  with all our heart c for HE saith in  Isaiah This people honoureth me with their lips but  c  In conformity with this good Father's idea we may ask after the manner of St  Paul  is  Jesus Christ  the God of the  New Testament only Is he not also of the Old Yea of the Old also  In the conclusion of the epistle St  Clement  exhorts the  Corinthians  to be vigilant c  because we know not  the day of  GOD  's  appearing  i e  undoubtedly the day when we  must appear before the judgmentseat of Christ  It is true as the learned translator acknowledges this second Epistle was neither held in so much reverence by the ancients nor is so generally received among the moderns as the first and it is certain St  Jerome Photius  and  Archbishop Usher  after them concur in endeavouring to represent it as a spurious production But I am apt to think every reader will be satisfied with what the learned Prelate has advanced in its defence though were the point still really controvertible as the ground of the objections  raised by these illustrious personages does not lie in the doctrine so explicitly contained in it and at the same time so consonant to the sentiments of the apostolical fathers I see no manner of necessity for retracting these quotations Whoever the author might be we have his clear sense of the matter  The charge of credulity brought against many of the Fathers by a late celebrated Author with vehemency of zeal and in the dialect of virulence even admitting it to be well founded cannot justly be thought to affect in the least the validity of these primitive and plain testimonies to the great truths of the Gospel as they  are most surely believed among us  There is not I am confident one circumstance to colour a charge of this nature against the Fathers from whom we have been drawing our evidence except that of the  Phoenix  by which as we shall see St  Clement  illustrates the doctrine of the resurrection And ample satisfaction will be given on that head in its proper place  o  To these testimonies we might subjoin those of  Justin Martyr Athenagoras Irenaeus  and a number of others the weight of whose collected evidence will be found infinitely to preponderate all that has perversely been alledged to its discredit from writers of a subsequent date and minor authority  p  This in due time will fully appear  Now if in all this doctrine we can see nothing like a formulary or system we see however from whence  confessions of faith  may reasonably be supposed to have originated and by what at this day they may be most justly defended Supposing the first rule of faith to have been purely the baptismal form or agreeing with Dr  Sykes  that the  very short Creed which at first was deemed sufficient to entitle men to baptism was no other than a faith in God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and earth and in  Jesus Christ  his Son our Lord and in the  Holy Ghost  even admitting this we cannot surely have recourse to better or sounder authority than that which has been  laid before you in order to know exactly what  this faith  implies It will be hard indeed if the Apostles and these Apostolical Fathers should be all along teaching heresy while they perpetually and earnestly though not formally or methodically complain of and expatiate against it  But I have yet farther to observe that the sense of antiquity and the faith of the primitive Church may be inferred from such circumstantial evidence as has never that I know of been professedly produced but yet I trust will be allowed to come little if at all short of demonstration  The infamous reproach which was cast upon the whole Christian name by its first enemies is a circumstance of a particular aspect to our purpose Christianity was called emphatically THE ATHEISM  q  Now I own I cannot help considering this equally horrid and ridiculous imputation as necessarily importing the primitive Christians to have worshipped  Jesus Christ  as ONE with the Father  or as "very God of very God" from all eternity For nothing less than such worship will account for the charge either from  Jews  or  Gentiles  It might naturally be considered by both as a kind of dethroning of the ONE SUPREME GOD But every modern unbeliever will readily agree with me that the idea of inferiority and delegation c is far from being irreconcileable with  Jewish  tenets or with known principles of Polytheism  r  According to the  Apostolical constitutions  as we learn from an eminent author it was customary for the priest after  amen  solemnly pronounced by the communicants in the holy sacrament to cry out with a loud voice    Holy things belong to holy persons  upon which the people answered  There is one Holy one Lord Jesus Christ  The same writer acquaints us from  Vegetius  an heathen author who flourished in the time of the younger  Valentinian  that Christians in a military capacity were used  to swear by  God Christ  and the  Holy Spirit  and the  Majesty  of the Emperor which next to God is to be honoured c  Cave's Prim Christ p Echard's Roman History Vol III p  In his  Dissertation on Epictetus Arrian  as Bishop  Wilkins  observes  assures us that in his time which was about an hundred and tweny years after Christ it was an usual form in the prayers of the heathen to say    Lord have mercy upon us  whereby they did acknowlege the  unity  of God says his Lordship which clause he adds is thought to have been from that usage taken into the Liturgy of Christians  Now if this be admitted I would remark that as the title of  Lord  confessedly belongs to our Saviour the Christians may fairly be supposed in their triple form of ejaculatory address  Lord have mercy upon us Christ have mercy upon us Lord have mercy us  to invoke  Christ  the  Lord  as supreme  God  or if by  Lord  we are in the first  and third petition to understand  God the Father  still we must be presumed in the intermediate one to address the  Son  as  equal  to the Father because we shall else be absurd enough to invoke the  supreme God  and a  subordinate being  with the same fervour and as it were in the same instant You will see the argument these pious ejaculations furnish us with whether we do or do not credit the account of  Arrian  See Wilkins on Nat Relig B I ch p  In confirmation of what has been offered I desire to add one or two more facts which if I mistake not have more weight in them than is commonly apprehended as for instance the appointment of the  Lord's day  and the style or title  by which churches were in the primitive times distinguished For can we do less in common reason than worship him with the  supreme God  and as the  supreme God  to whose particular honour one day in the week is for ever to be  kept holy  on whose particular account the most sacred observances of religion were transferred  from the  seventh  day of the week to the  first  and whose peculiar house is now the only  house of prayer for all people  I shall conclude this discourse with reminding you of a circumstance if possible still more decisive I mean the  Unitarian  doctrine which is so copiously and so emphatically inculcated in the  Koran  of  Mahomet  See Passim  Of the person of  Jesus Christ  in his prophetical character this arch impostor speaks in terms the most respectable  God says he gave miracles to  Jesus  the son of  Mary  and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit c  Jesus  said in the cradle verily I am the servant of God This was  Jesus  the son of  Mary s  the word of truth c Verily God promiseth thee a son named  John  says the angel  Gabriel  to  Zechariah  according to the  Koran  who shall bear witness to the WORD which cometh from God an honourable person chaste and one of the righteous prophets  To do honour to the author of  Christianity in this capacity  Mahomet  positively asserts that  they the  Jews  slew him not neither crucified him but that he was represented by one in his likeness They did not really kill him says he but God took him up unto himself  But with respect to our Lord's Divinity or equality with the Father you have among a thousand parallel ones the sentiments following  They viz the Christians say God hath begotten children God forbid It is not meet for God that he should have any son God forbid Blessed be he that hath revealed the  Forkan  Koran to whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth who hath begotten no issue and hath no partner in his kingdom c Yet have they taken other Gods besides him which have created nothing but are themselves created c  Jesus  is no other than a servant whom we favoured with the gift of prophecy c When  Jesus  came with evident miracles he said now am I come unto you with wisdom and to explain  unto you part of those things concerning which ye disagree wherefore fear God and obey me Verily God is my Lord and your Lord wherefore worship him He is God besides whom there is no God c Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with him The th ch of the  Koran  is entitled  the declaration of God's Unity  and the whole runs thus Say God is one God  t  the eternal God he begetteth not neither is he begotten and there is not any like unto him In the th ch is the following question How should he have issue since he hath no consort  That these carnal sentiments this gross language the language of infidels and scoffers every day is directly levelled not at a  new  or  strange  thing not at a peculiar tenet of a few enthusiasts or a particular sect of Christians but at the leading article the fundamental principle of our religion may be affirmed in utter defiance of the united powers of effrontery and equivocation The  doctrine of the Trinity was most indisputably the standing doctrine of the Christian Church at the time this false prophet broached his imposture in the beginning of the seventh century All these considerations combined demolish in a moment the several forts of infidelity in early corruptions in Monastic superstition in Gothic barbarism Scholastic subtilty and Papal innovation  v  DISCOURSE V  JOHN V part of verse  This  HE  is the true Godaccording to some versions and perhaps defensible ones See Webster and Scot's Christian Life Vol II p    See Whitby in loc  is the true God  HAVING I trust already beyond all reasonable doubt ascertained the absolute Divinity of Jesus Christ  by many infallible proofs  from holy writ and by other arguments of a nature little less demonstrative I scruple not to set the words just read to you in the front of the present discourse as plainly declarative of this great doctrine though singly and separately considered they may not on a critical review of the whole verse be altogether unliable to cavil or if  you please to exception And I hope very much to strengthen what has been advanced by shewing the repugnancy of antitrinitarian principles to the genius and design of the Christian dispensation or in other words by proving that if we solely or chiefly regard our blessed Saviour under any character inferior to that of the  true God  our highest ideas will come infinitely short both of the dignity of his Person and the nature and end of his Commission  By affecting the common appellation of  Unitarians  modern unbelievers as well the followers of  Socinus  as the disciples of  Arius  who again may be ranged under many more classes than one appear in some sort to be ashamed of the leaders of their respective heresies and to desert the captains under whose banners they fight But be their several motives hereunto what they may tho' indeed they are obvious enough it will suffice without concerning myself with particular conceits to take into consideration the two following general persuasions  First that of those who regard our Saviour merely as a Legislator or teacher of morality by divine commission and  Secondly that of those who profess themselves  both almost and altogether such as  we are his coequality with the Father excepted  With a view to the confutation of  Socinian  principles I would observe in the first place that the title of Legislator or Lawgiver is by no means that by which  Jesus Christ  is distinguished or particularly described either in the  old  or  new Testament  The great characters of  Wonderful Counsellor Prince of peace the Sun of righteousness  Mal iv  the Lord our righteousness  Jer xxiii  the  Messiah  the  chosen of God  Luke xxiii  the  Christ of God  of  Mediator  and  Advocate  of  Saviour Redeemer  and  HighPriest  of  Son of David Son of God Son of the Blessed  Mar xiv  Lamb of God Lord of glory  Cor ii  Prince of life Author and Captain of our Salvation  Heb ii v  these characters and more that might be enumerated import little or nothing of legislation  but are almost wholly significative of the personal quality of our Saviour and of his own moral excellence and of the value and efficacy of his sacrifice He was it is true a  teacher sent from God  but he was not sent primarily in the capacity of a  teacher  To instruct the world in righteousness was not the grand and ultimate but merely a subordinate end of his appearance and indeed a necessary consequence of it  Let us see then in the second place what the Scripture and he himself declares to have been the more immediate purpose for which he was  made flesh and dwelt among us To this end was I born  John xviii  says he  and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness to the truth  Again  God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life  Ibid iii  Again  I must work the work of him that sent me  Matt ix  I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  John ix  He hath anointed me to preach the  Gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and to set at liberty those that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord  Once more  I must preach the kingdom of God for therefore am I sent  Luke iv  What the sum and substance of our Saviour's preaching was will be remembered presently and mean time we shall find his Apostles delivering themselves in language corresponsive to the above  The law was given by Moses  says St  John but grace and peace came by Jesus Christ  John i  In this was manifested the love of God towards us  says the same Apostle  because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him Herein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins  John iv  Again  When the fulness of time was come  says St  Paul God sent forth his son made of a woman that we might receive the adoption of Sons  Gal iv  This is a faithful saying  says the same Apostle  and worthy of  all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners  Tim i  And to adduce only one passage more  the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world  Tit ii c  The question then will be how or in what manner we are taught to live thus or in other words what we are to understand by  Christ's  religion regarding it as a system of morality  I must beg leave then in the third place to put you in mind that Christianity is not a  new  law properly speaking but a new edition if I may so say or promulgation of the  old  agreeably to the express declaration of its Divine Author who assures us that he  came not to destroy the  moral  law or the prophets but to fulfil both  Matt v  The fact is  Christ blotted out the hand writing of carnal ordinances  Col ii  and took out of the way  the whole ceremonial of Judaism but left every thing  which was intrinsically  holy  and  just  and  good  in the law in its full force and obligation He was the  mediator of a better covenant  he laid the foundation of a new system of faith and a purer mode of worship but he repealed not a single law of  Moses  that had any thing in it properly of a moral and binding nature A religion of this sort supposed and required reformation in the lives of its professors and accordingly our blessed Lord in his excellent discourse on the mount and in other places enforces the import and explains the obligation of many of the precepts of the  Jewish  lawgiver the full sense and genuine meaning of which had been perverted by the false glosses and misconstructions of later ages and particularly of the  Scribes  and  Pharisees  We find him perpetually upbraiding these with their substitutions of oral tradition in the room of the written word of God and with absurdly and impiously  teaching for doctrines the commandments of men  Matt xv  In these instances he nobly rescues the Scripture from human corruptions  and faithfully discharges the important office not of a maker or prescriber of law but of a doctor or expounder of it  Suitably to all this our Lord cites and refers to the law of  Moses  upon all occasions  If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments  Matt xix  viz  the commandments contained in the  Mosaic  decalogue was his answer to the person who had asked him  what he should do that he might have eternal lise  When the  lawyer  by way of  tempting  him put this question to him  which is the great commandment in the law  Ibid xxii  He mentions those  two  capital ones which though not literally to be found among the  ten  virtually comprehended them all namely the  love of God and of our neighbour  at once satisfying and confounding his insidious querist with this apposite and decisive reply Accordingly when he told his disciples that he gave them a  new commandment  John xiii  in his particular injunction to them to  love one another  he  was not teaching a  new doctrine or bringing strange things to their ears  this duty being evidently implied in the  love  of our  neighbour  but only injoining a duty by the practice of which his followers ought to be more especially distinguished to which they had inducements of an extraordinary nature to which they were bound by ties and considerations peculiarly Christian and by reverence for his astonishingly great example who so  loved  them  and washed  them  from  their  sins in his own blood  Rev i  In perfect consistence with this the Apostles  preached the Gospel  after their  Lord  and  Master  had left the world and was  gone to his Father  They taught Gospel truths they insisted on St  Paul  more especially they rejoiced they gloried in their deliverance from  bondage under weak and beggarly elements  Gal iv  they exulted in the abolition of the ceremonial law as a mere temporary establishment and shadowy institution but at the same time they regarded the moral law  as of inviolable authority and a complete standard of conduct still When the Apostle just now named exposes the extreme folly of such transgressors of the law as stood selfcondemned or complains of the rigour of its requisitions or declares the impossibility of yielding meritorious obedience  to it  and consequently of obtaining Salvation  under it  its subsistence and obligation are supposed beyond all possible contradiction That it  could not make the comers thereunto perfect  was an argument of its own intrinsic perfection The same great Apostle pressing upon his  Roman  converts the duties of  brotherly love  and universal charity recites almost all the commandments of the second table and subjoins that comprehensive precept of  Moses  just now mentioned which he no doubt considered as inclusive of every evangelical precept even that of  loving our enemies thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  St  James  calls this very precept this great social principle the  royal law  James ii  and when he argues against the folly and presumption of a partial  obedience to the divine commandments and a commuting as it were for iniquities rests his argument wholly in that supreme authority by which the law of  Moses  was enacted  he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill  James ii  In short both our Lord and his Apostles inculcated and enlarged upon many things of practical importance as circumstances admitted and occasions required but they taught nothing of this kind but what was reducible to the  Mosaic  institutions or to some general head of  Jewish  or natural morality I add of natural morality because the law of nature the law of  Moses  and the law of  Christ  are in point of morality one and the same the latter illustrating explaining enforcing and recommending the two former but neither  adding to  nor  diminishing from  them For the  reason  or  fitness  of things is absolutely unalterable and whatever is in its own nature morally good or evil has always been so and will for ever continue so to be The moral law which was once written upon  tables of stone  was originally  engraved upon the  fleshly tables  of man's  heart u  To maintain or to imagine otherwise is to  charge God foolishly  and to suppose both the law and the Gospel to prescribe a practice in some instances unnatural and unreasonable St  Paul  's descriptions of the gross ignorance and depravity of the heathen world are equally animated and just  Rom i c  But notwithstanding this the irradiations of reason and conscience are sometimes beautifully visible amidst this  blackness  of spiritual  darkness  We might extract from the writings of  Pagan  authors philosophers and others of different times and in different places a moral system against which collectively taken should lie no fair exception and produce from them sentiments finely coinciding with the most exalted principles and most refined doctrines of Christianity  In these writings we find the purest piety the exactest justice the truest benevolence the firmest fortitude the noblest disinterestedness and the meekest patience most explicitly taught and earnestly inculcated  w  Tully  divides the duty of man as we do at this day  viz  into that which is due first to God secondly to our neighbour and thirdly to ourselves  Haec philosophia nos primum ad Deorum cultum deinde ad jus hominum quod situm est in generis humani societate tum ad modestiam magnitudinemque animi erudivit  Tusc Q l I  The golden rule of equity  whatsoever ye would that men should do to you  c Matt vii  See Whitby in loc  obtained as many have observed both among  Jews  and  Gentiles  and was delivered by them as well negatively as positively and under various modes of expression That to intend wickedness is to commit it is the express doctrine of  Seneca  as quoted by  LeClerc  in his note on the th Chapter of the  th  book of  Grotius  and which is still more remarkable he instances in cases of lust and sensuality  Incesta est etiam sine stupro quae cupit stuprum  Even so great a debauchee as  Ovid  speculates well upon this subject  Quae quia non licuit non facit illa facit  Ut jam servaris bene corpus adultera mens est  Omnibus exclusis intus adulter erit  Ibid  This is precisely the morality of our Divine Legislator Forgiveness of enemies c is a great point of morality which the heathens were far from being unacquainted with According to  Plutarch  it was a prayer of the  Lacedaemonians  that the  gods would enable them to bear injuries  And we are informed by the same great biographer that  Dion  maintained true philosophy to consist not in shewing kindness to friends but in forgiving injuries and pardoning offences  Menander  is clearly of the same opinion in the following fine passage      See Le Clerc's Note above referred to  Some of the philosophers argued against present solicitude and the  taking  too much  thought for the morrow  precisely as our Saviour does in his discourse on the mount A philosopher or wise man ought not to be anxious about these things  viz food  c c  is a sentence quoted by Dr  Whitby  in his note on v Ch of St  Matthew  The following sentiment of  Plato    See Plato de Leg l  is almost a counterpart to our Saviour's  of every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account at the day of judgment Tully  's notion of the  servitude  of a sinner quadrates exactly with the doctrine of our blessed Lord and of St  Paul  after him  Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin  John viii  says the former  his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness  Rom vi  says the latter and says  Cicero si servitus sit obedientia fracti animi et arbitrio carentis suo quis neget omnes imbrobos esse servos  Tully's Par  On the other hand  Deo parere libertas est  says  Seneca  in the spirit of a Christian and the language of the Church in one of the  Collects  of which God's service is called  perfect freedom  The same philosopher represents the Deity as a most beneficent Being who  maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just  and on the unjust ecce sceleratis  says he  sol oritur et piratis patent maria  Sen de Ira l c de vit beat  And to mention only one particular more he directs us in another place to consider human afflictions as the corrections of a father for our spiritual benefit God he says  sicut severus pater durius educat  See Wilkins B c  which is almost literally the sentiment of the Apostle  Heb xii c  The frailty of human nature our radical disinclination to virtue the necessity of propitiation and our want of extraneous assistance as well as of personal resolution for the purpose of a good life are points often intimated and as often insisted upon by  Pagan  writers The  nitimur in vetitum  of the poet was a sort of standing  thesis  with many The multitude of heathen sacrifices shews a consciousness of guilt and a solicitude for atonement Their sense of the need of a divine blessing on their endeavours in general appears sufficiently from their undertaking nothing of moment whether of a public or  private concern without the previous observance of certain rites and ceremonies or as  Pliny  expresses himself in the introduction to his  panegyric  on  Trajan sine deorum immortalium ope consilio et honore  It may not be easy to ascertain what we are to understand by the  Daemon  or the  Genius  which by his own account attended  Socrates  but it is certain the notion of  good and evil genii  prevailed much in the heathen world In the following lines the warmth of divine infusion in the human breast is beautifully expressed by  Ovid  Est Deus in nobis agitante calescimus illo  Impetus hic sacrae semina mentis habet  Sententiae illus ex Ovid See Cumberland on the defects of heathen Deism p  The necessity of supernatural impulse to the regulation of human conduct has always been acknowleged  Tully  says somewhere  Nemo unquam vir magnus sine divino afflatu fuit  and  Homer  affirms by the mouth of  Polydamas  that God is the dispenser of all our talents or endowments whatsoever    c c Il lib xiii v    et seq  Correspondently with all this philosophers have represented the difficulty of persevering in a virtuous course under the very same metaphor which is used by our Blessed Saviour himself  Cebes  affirms that there is a  little gate  See Whitby on Matt  at the entrance of the path that leads to happiness c and that it is a path which few walk in in which    When we consider these sentiments and principles independently and separately from whatever is erroneous inconsistent or extravagant in heathen authors we can do no less than reverence them as doing credit to human nature in its most depraved state as so many efforts of reason nobly struggling to emerge from a vast abyss of ignorance and impurity The grand use and advantage of the Gospel regarded as a moral scheme is not so  much  that things are uniformly taught therein and delivered in consummate purity as that they are taught with proper authority by a Legislator  See Locke's Reasonab of Christian p  from heaven and under sanctions the most efficacious imaginable In short the  Christian religion stands particularly discriminated from all other institutions by the personal preeminence of its Author and by the transcendent graciousness importance and splendor of the dispensation  If we regard our Saviour under any character inferior to that of the true God at least if we regard him merely as a man or as a lawgiver we shall find few or no marks of that originality by which the founders of all persuasions religious or philosophical are distinguished As a prophet he was  like unto Moses  according to the express prediction of the latter as a worker of  miracles  he stood supereminent but not single as a teacher or instructer he followed precedents his apologues and allegories were agreeable to the oriental mode and many of his parables were borrowed from the  Jews  See Whitby on Matt v v  even that excellent form of prayer which he taught his disciples was almost entirely taken out of the  Jewish  liturgies and the sacraments which "he ordained in his  "Church" were graffed upon a  Jewish  stock  baptism  being a rite which the  Jews  observed with the exactness of superstition and that of the  Lord's Supper  being transferr'd from their practice of  eating bread and drinking wine  in an eucharistical way at the celebration of the  Passover  See Patrick's Disc on Baptism p Allix's Reflect V p Potter's Ch Government  The great Apostle to the  Hebrews  seems to set the matter before us in the clearest light  He  says he  that despised Moses's law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he  be thought worthynot who hath broken the law of the Gospel but  who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath accounted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite to the spirit of grace  Heb x  Immoralities it is true and those of the grossest kind are implied in these words but they are such as are most provokingly aggravated by singular contemptuousness and the least that can be inferred from this passage is that a  greater than  Moses is here  How does  Socinianism  shrink before such considerations as these  But it is little material which of two errors may be most plausible when both are equidistant from the centre of truth Our blessed Saviour is no more  halfGod  than he is  all man  if I have leave so to express myself nor will  Arianism  fix a firmer basis of faith by its chimerical expedient of a secondary worship and a gradation of Deity For this at best will be found to be neither more nor less than  Paganism  improved and contracted within a smaller circle It must be equally idolatrous equally injurious to the honour of the Supreme Being to acknowlege  Gods many  or Gods few or only one God  besides  him Infinite almost as the number of subaltern deities was among the Heathens there is no doubt but the wisest of them at least acted nearly upon  Arian  principles  viz  under a persuasion of the existence and properties and with a reservation of the prerogatives of the one Supreme God According to universal tradition  the notion of a supreme power a selfexistent independent Being a first cause of all things prevailed more or less every where in the world  See Shuckford's Sac and Prof Hist connec Vol B  The doctrine of divine Supremacy was no secret even among people whose religious rites and usages were silly and extravagant enough to render them obnoxious to the scorn and laughter of mankind thro' all ages The superstitions of the  Aegyptians  were gross and numberless and their worship of the meanest animals and indeed of things inanimate was beyond measure contemptible And yet they had an opinion with respect to God that erred even on the side of spirituality For they held that he is not to be addressed by mortals so much as in vocal prayer  See Parker on Idolatry p  This is at once an instance of strong belief and mistaken veneration The great attributes of the Deity are asserted by writers of all sorts by philosophers and by poets and in terms of the fullest significancy His spirituality omnipotence omnipresence independence invisibility and incomprehensible nature are  set in a very strong light by  Pagan  authors particularly by  Pythagoras Plato Anaxagoras Cicero Porphyry Seneca Homer  and the  Greek Dramatists x  I have not time or occasion to produce my authorities here The truth is many  goodly pearls  of speculative doctrine are to be found amongst the rubbish of  Pagan  antiquity and they strikingly contrast an enormous  farrago  of traditionary error radical prejudice vulgar folly and popular superstition They are the sentiments of minds that seem to have been enlightened beyond the conceptions of the bulk of mankind If we separate the carnal  dross  from the spiritual  bullion  of heathenism we shall be able to extract a body of theoretic divinity from the old  Pagans  little if at all inferior to the finest  unitarian  system In short if  Arianism  be not strictly  polytheism  it is not much better it is maintainable only on much the same ground and by a similar mode of reasoning  Surely a  Tully  or a  Plato  had as admissible an apology for his conformity to idolatrous  services in general prepossession and national establishment as the modern unbeliever has for his secondary worship in any distiction he may affect to make between  Pagan  and  Arian  theology For unless the holy Scriptures direct us in the plainest manner and with all possible cautiousness of expression NOT  to honour the Son even as we honour the Father  if they do not clearly and uniformly distinguish between  Jesus Christ  and the  Holy Ghost  and the  Supreme God  in point of  nature  or  essence  or in other words if  Arianism  has not a most firm foundation in the sacred pages and in apostolical and primitive worship we cannot honestly resolve it into any thing but the pride of human reason fabricating its own theory and  resisting the Holy Ghost  Now the invalidity of its pretences has I persuade myself been sufficiently shewn already and therefore we are to reject its hypothesis together with that of  Socinianism  as respectively aiming to establish  another doctrine  than  that  we have  received  as fundamentally erroneous and absolutely repugnant to the genius and spirit of Christianity  But because the  strength  of true believers may be said in some sense to be  made perfect in the weakness  of their antagonists as a giant appears to most advantage when confronted with a pigmy I shall take my next opportunity for your conviction that the  antitrinitarian  cause has its chief support in disingenuous evasion flimsy sophistry or wilful misconstruction and neither is nor can be defended from the  strong holds  of reason or by  weapons  from the armory of Sacred Writ  DISCOURSE VI  GAL Chap part of verse  There be some that trouble you and would pervert the Gospel of Christ  THE Apostle as appears from the argument he prosecutes throughout this epistle had in the words just read an eye to those  Jewish  converts who were so zealously attached to the  Mosaic  ritual the  law  of their  fathers  that they could not endure to see it superseded by the more liberal the more pure the more sublime principles of the Gospel But I shall avail myself of the latitude my text admits not hesitating to regard as  perverters  of the  Gospel  those heretics of different sorts whose unfairness or  imbecility of allegation construction and exception on the part of infidelity I stand engaged to make appear in the following discourse  That pride or prepossession should be tenacious of any opinion however strange or however extravagant will be no matter of surprize to us when we recollect that almost every thing which we see not by immediate intuition or which is not capable of a strictly mathematical demonstration may be started and upheld for a subject of dispute It is possible indeed and it sometimes happens that men shall reason injudiciously and inconclusively even in a righteous cause and truth may suffer or rather be supposed to suffer by precipitance of passion or inadvertency of zeal This before now has been the case with the cause before us A pious wish to confirm the doctrine of the  Trinity  by producing multifarious evidence and heaping proof upon proof  y  or an earnest endeavour to elucidate a point the knowlege of which is too wonderful and excellent for  the attainment of human wisdom by metaphysical nicety and the sagacity of abstract speculation  z  or by studied similitudes and artificial allusions to bring it nearer to our conceptions all this has been hurtful to the interest of religion and  given occasion to the enemy  to ridicule if not to  blaspheme  Erroneous constructions and misapplication of particular passages betray too often a want of moderation or of skill in interpreters But all this while a charge of unskilfulness or of prevarication or of perverseness or of presumption or of insincerity or of intemperance will come with a very ill grace from our adversaries and we are to look on the side of infidelity for the most visible signs of weakness and the surest tokens of conscious distress I am apt to believe you will soon be convinced by a few select particulars that this is not arbitarily or groundlessly said  I shall hardly be called upon to apologize for freedoms I shall be obliged to take with authors who are no more It will be acknowleged with respect to every  Arian  c  of note that to mischievous purpose he  being dead yet speaketh  To proceed then  That when we are baptized  in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost  we are baptized in the name of three Persons and of three Divine Persons and of three equally Divine Persons  See Lightfoot's Harm of the N Test Sect p  seems not to be more evident from Scripture than from the reason of the thing For else we are baptized in the name of  two  Persons and  one  virtue or quality c which is a notion palpably ridiculous or we are baptized in the name of  three  Persons betwixt the  first  and  two latter  of which there is an infinite disparity there being no medium between God and a creature which is a supposition not less ridiculous And in fact the  Baptismal Form  is so strong that heretics have found themselves under a necessity of changing it or of explaining it away some baptizing into the  death of Christ  some  in the name of the uncreated God and in the name of the created Son and in the name of the sanctifying  Spirit created by the created Son  Dr  Clarke  to whom  Arianism  is under great obligations writes as follows  We are baptized  says he  into the profession of that belief and an obligation to the practice of that religion which God the Father has revealed and taught by the Son and confirmed and established by the Holy Ghost  If this is extrication what is difficulty  See a late work entitled An Elucidation of the Unity c p where this  Form  is treated with equal freedom  The same learned author paraphrases the introduction to St  John  's Gospel in the following words  With God the Father the FIRST the SUPREME cause and original of all things there existed  before all ages  that  Divine Person  whose name is called the  Word of God  the  only begotten of the Father  the  brightness of his glory  and by ineffable COMMUNICATION of divine power and perfections the  express image of his Person  The fine artifice of this paraphrase will escape a common or a cursory reader I guess Dr Cwould never have consented to the least alteration in this passage  or have permitted us only for  ineffable  to read  eternal  The phrase  before all ages  is designedly ambiguous and imports merely an acknowlegement of the impossibility of fixing the date of the generation of the  Son of God  In the beginning was the word  John i  says St  John  i e if we will hearken to the  Socinians Jesus Christ  existed when the Gospel was first preached by  John  the  Baptist  or if you please by himself  The word was with God  i e was  known to God and to God only  or  was with God by  being  taken up into heaven to receive his prophetic commission  agreeably to a parallel exposition of another passage which will be presently noticed and both by the same interpreters  The word was God viz  in a secondary or derivative sense in a sense implying  Christ's  priority and superiority to all other creatures so that if we take this whole sentence together  the word was with God and the word was God  the term  God  is to be understood in the proper sense in the first clause and in an improper and inferior sense in the second as Dr C  and others according to a judicious writer's remark  ingeniously  expound this passage  No man hath ascended into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the Son of man who is in heaven  John iii  are the words of our Lord himself in the same Gospel Perhaps the  Socinian  construction of this text which was just now laid before you is little less romantic than  Grotius  's exposition of the words  he that came down from heaven  i e says this famous commentator he that  was sent or given to us by the special Grace of God  As some interpreters make or more properly invent a distinction between primary and secondary worship and would fain have us believe in a created creator or a deity by delegation so others of a very different stamp  think  of the  Saviour of the world  as meanly as they can possibly  think  and divest him of almost every ray of glory  The word was made flesh and dwelt among us  says St  John  John i  Christ  was born  mortal subject to infirmities and sufferings  c say some  Socinian  expositors the  word  WAS  flesh  simply and absolutely say others the  word  was MADE or CONVERTED into  flesh  says the  Flandrian Anabaptist  St  Paul  assures the  Colossians  that in  Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fulness  Col ii  of the Godhead bodily viz  all the will of God as we are given to understand by  Socinus Before Abraham was  I AM  John viii  says our Lord expressly to the  Jews  by which he means only to affirm according to some interpreters that he was the  Messiah before Abraham was the father of many nations  or as others expound shall I say or wrest this scripture that he existed or WAS before  Abraham  in the  purpose  and  decree  of God How far the name of  Grotius  dignifies this exposition let every intelligent hearer judge Or let us see whether we are like to derive more satisfaction from the following explanation or rather evacuation of this text by the celebrated  author of the  Scripture doctrine of the Trinity  Before Abraham was and before all  generations  I had a being with him of whom  Moses  told the  Isralites  that his name was I AM  That often justly cited passage in the  th  Chapter of the Epistle to the  Romans of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever  is a rankling  thorn  in the  eyes  of unbelievers which Dr C wished to  extract  with the  poultice  of a devised ambiguity He would have us believe that the original  Greek  is of a doubtful construction and may signify either  of whom Christ came God who is over all be blessed for ever  or  of whom Christ came who is over all God be blessed for ever  To this text we shall have occasion to turn again  The  Arians  in general confess that the Divine Personage who so often and sometimes so magnificently makes his appearance under the Old Testament is  Jesus Christ  the  Son of God  yet when this transcendent Being  expressly says  I am the God of Bethel  we are to understand him as in effect saying only  my Father whom I represent is God of Bethel  Such is the sense of these expositors who however kindly and  logically  grant that  the Word was with God  or in plain terms existed from all eternity tho' not  actually  yet  potentially  One is tempted to speak ludicrously by the extravagance of these conceits Is not this  making the word of God of none effect  thro' wantonness of interpretation Is not this turning holy Scripture which should be the  rule of faith  into a mere plaything of fancy  Let us take a view of another famous writer's sentiments on this important subjectMr  Whiston  after acknowleging  Jesus Christ  whom he calls  to have given the law upon mount  Sinai  to have appeared to the Patriarchs c and to have taken  the peculiar style titles attributes adoration and incommunicable name of the God of  Israel  supposes him to have been  truly and really concerned in the  creation of the world  But observe he was a Creator merely by commission c  it being according to this author unfit and impossible for the DIVINE NATURE ITSELF or at least THAT OF THE FATHER to be so much and in such a manner concerned with the corporeal world and the sinful race of mankind as we every where find this DIVINE PERSON our blessed Mediator to have been  Whiston's Solution c p  And so we are obliged to this philosopher for his wonderful discovery that  Jesus Christ  tho' a DIVINE PERSON with all the attributes c and the "incommunicable name of the God of  Israel"  was yet without the DIVINE NATURE because it is impossible for the DIVINE NATURE to act in the abstract or at least for THAT of the FATHER to do so which it seems is something  distinct  from or superior to the  Divine  If this is not Christianity it is tolerable Platonism  But the grand expedient to which a latementioned Divine and indeed the  Arian  fraternity have usually recourse is yet behind Unable to with stand the united force of the several texts by which the full Divinity of our Saviour is evinced they contrive to resolve the whole of his Deity into that absolute authority which they say he derives from his Father and exercises jointly with him in the government of the universe Dr  Clarke  not unartfully tells us that  the reason why the Scripture tho' it stiles the Father God and also stiles the Son God yet at the same time always declares that there is but one God is because in the monarchy of the universe there is but one authority original in the Father derivative in the Son the power of the Son being not another power opposite to that of the Father nor another power coordinate to that of the Father but itself the power and authority of the Father communicated to manifested in and exercised by the Son  Scrip Doc of the Trin Prop See Stephens's Sermon on the eternal generation c  But did not or would not this able writer recollect that something besides power was communicated when the  Father gave to the  Son to have  LIFE  in himself  John v  From which passage I take occasion to observe that when an ambiguous word occurs in any passage of Scripture or a term which independently considered appears to denote communication from the Father and inferiority in the Son its signification is generally qualified and restrained by the plain tenor and importance of the whole sentence This is eminently the case with the text last quoted  As the Father hath life himself  says our Blessed Lord  so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself  In this phrase  having life in himself  which is a periphrasis of  Jehovah  the first and most essential name of the Deity the selfexistence both of Father and Son from all eternity is necessarily implied because tho' the word  given  imports communication of an incomprehensible kind yet such communication must have been from eternity To assert that the Father gave selfexistence to the Son from all eternity at any supposed period of time would be neither more nor  less than a contradiction in terms  See this text miserably distorted in Locke's Reasonab of Christian p  It may be worth while to adduce two or three instances more  By him viz  by  Jesus Christ  says St  Paul  to the  Colossians were all things created that are in Heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible c all things were created by him and for him  Ch Does not all this imply  unoriginateness  Is not  Christ  represented here as absolutely the Creator Yet in this very chapter reference is had to the Gospeldispensation and in that reference terms must necessarily be used importing subordination and inferiority So in the st chap of the  Revelation  where  Christ  is styled  Alpha  and  Omega the beginning and the ending  c the same reference is made  I am he that liveth and was dead  So again  the Word was with God  says St  John  and this expression does not necessarily imply equality or coexistence But what follows  The Word was God  We not unfrequently meet with interpreters who agree in opposition to the catholic sense of a passage but differ in the mode of  it who like contrary qualities in bodies counteracting each other mutually defeat their respective ends by repugnancy of construction We will turn to one or two singular instances of this  By whom also  Heb  he made the worlds  says the Apostle to the  Hebrews  speaking of  Jesus Christ  One should hardly think these words liable to be misunderstood But  Grotius  unwilling as it should seem that  Jesus Christ  should be supposed to have any concern in the creation even as an agent or minister gives us to know that the  worlds  were  made  not  by  him but  for  him or for his sake agreeably enough to part of a text just now cited and agreably to the notion of the  Jewish  Rabbins that the world was made for the  Messiah  Now in the first place not to insist with Dr  Whitby  that this construction manifestly wrests the preposition  with a  genitive case  annexed to it from its proper import I wish to observe that there is no admitting this learned writer's exposition of the place before us and of that other passage of the Epistle  to the  Romans Christ was raised from the dead  Rom  by the glory of the Father  the single one with which he supports his interpretation without obscuring or confounding our ideas of the divine operations For according to our author  God  the  Father made the worlds  for the  glory  of his  Son  but raised up that Son from the dead for his own  gloryChrist was raised from the dead for the glory of the Father  says our commentator so that by this interpretation the Apostle in effect affirms that  Christ was raised from the dead by the Father for the glory of the Father  which at best is uncouth phraseology But let us see how the passage will fare under the management of  Socinus  and his followers These gentlemen are sensible of the powers of the preposition in question but are equally reluctant to believe  Jesus Christ  to have been the Maker of the Universe  By whom he made the Worlds  i e say they by whose agency or ministry God established  a spiritual kingdom and reconciled the world unto himself  by the Gospel dispensation  Are not these several expositions as irreconcileable as light and darkness And have we not reason in abundance rather to reject both than to subscribe to either I just observe farther that  Grotius  had been more consistent had he done no violence to the preposition aforesaid and adopted the  Socinian  interpretation For he is intirely of one mind with the  Socinians  in his explication of the abovecited parallel in the  first Chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians  But this is not the only instance of this great writer's inconsistency with others and with himself Convinced by ocular demonstration of the resurrection of his Master  Thomas answered and said  that is say some very gravely in effect cried out or exclaimed  My Lord and my God  For it seems this is not the language of confession but of astonishment  Grotius  however sees this matter in a very different light  Hic primum says he ea vox in narratione Evangelica reperitur ab Apostolis Jesu tributa postquam scilicet sua resurrectione probaverat  se esse a quo vita et quidem aeterna expectari deberet Mansit deinde ille mos in Ecclesia ut apparet non tantum in scriptis Apostolicis ut in nono capite Epistolae ad Romanos commate quinto et veterum Christianorum ut videre est apud Justinum Martyrem contra Tryphonem sed et in Plinii ad Trajanum Epistola ubi ait Christianos Christo ut Deo carmina cecinisse  See Grotius in loc  And yet we are not much obliged to this eminent commentator for an acknowlegement which appears to have been forced from him In the first place it is not true that Christ is styled God purely because he is  the resurrection and the life  as is here more than intimated It is not true that he is so called by the Apostles and first Christians merely on the strength of the passage before us For though the terms in which St  Thomas  declares his conviction  My Lord and my God  occur not before nor possibly could Christ is not only in effect in many places but also expressly styled God in this Gospel In the next place it is worth remarking that this  author in some sort at least asserts the Divinity of Christ from a text of which when he takes it separately in hand he questions the authenticity  See Grotius on Rom ix  The truth is we find too many among us perpetually leaning to the side of infidelity by softening and qualifying as much as possible the sense of texts which are quoted every day on the part of the orthodox An eminent commentator supposes the first prayer of the Apostles  Thou Lord who knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  to be address'd not to  Jesus Christ  but simply to God  Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved  says St  Peter  in his discourse on the  day of Pentecost  i e says Dr  Pyle  Whosoever shall believe and embrace his religion  which paraphrase plainly reprobates the idea of invocation on  Christ  The reference of the words  he is Lord of all  in St  Peter  's address to  Cornelius  either to God the Father  or to  Jesus Christ  is at best perversely singular and surely neither just nor natural  To this end  says St  Paul  to the  Romans Christ both died and rose c that he might be Lord both of the dead and living  Rom xiv  i e according to our author's inadequate illustration that  he might be the Saviour and rewarder of all good Christians  St  Paul  wishes  grace  and  peace  to the Church at  Corinth c to them that are called to be saints  Cor i  with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord c viz  as the same writer interprets the passage  to all who worship God through  Jesus Christ  the Lord and Saviour of all that profess his religion  In the second Chapter of this Epistle the Apostle calls our Saviour  the Lord of glory  meaning it seems thereby simply the  Messiah God was manifest in the flesh  says the same Apostle to  Timothy  which being interpreted by this writer is only equivalent to  the Son of God took upon him our nature  In short our author's notion  of the whole  mystery  of the Gospel seems to be lamentably insufficient when he tells and in more places than one tells us that it signifies only the admission of  Gentiles  as well as  Jews  into the Christian covenant  But a very recent instance of perverse interpretation in the work of a sensible and specious author  Mr Taylor See his  Key  to the Apostolical Writings  out of our Church is fit to be taken into particular consideration In his note on that famous passage in the Epistle to the  Romans  which the Antitrinitarians are ever attempting to press into the service of  Arianism  as has already been in effect seen  viz of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever  this author admits the justness of the application to our blessed Lord who says he  is  God over all  as he is by the Father APPOINTED Lord King and Governour of all  And then he refers to several texts as declarative of such APPOINTMENT  The Father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the Son John v    Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God c John xiii    All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth Matt xxviii    The word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all c Acts x    God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name Phil ii    and set him at is own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power c and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come c Ephes i  c  He hath put all things under his feet  c  Cor xv    This says our author is our Lord's SUPREME GODHEAD And that he is  blessed for ever  or the object of everlasting blessing is evident from Revelation v  Worthy is the Lamb c to receive blessing c and every creature  c  heard I saying blessing and honour c be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and to the Lamb for ever  c Now it is very observable that in some of the places here referred to there is not any intimation of an  appointment  The annotator seems to be aware of this when it is too late he grows jealous of the passage he had admitted and like one conscious of having allowed more than his hypothesis could conveniently afford to all intents and purposes revokes his grant by a counter construction and so at one dash deprives our Lord both of his blessedness and supremacy For thus he proceeds  But what this part of his character in which he is  more nearly related  to believing  Gentiles  than to infidel  Jews  has to do with  privileges belonging to the latter  doth not seem to me very clear much less can I conceive why the Apostle in this particular enumeration of  Jewish  privileges should not mention their relation to God  as their God  in which they particularly gloried Chapter ii and which was indeed the glory of all their  glories being the first and grand article in the covenant with  Abraham  and which he fails not to assert among the singular privileges of  Christians  Ch v when he is shewing that the subjects of their glorying were not inferior to those of the  Jews  How could he overlook the main article of this list Or what if there should be a transposition of a single letter in the text  for  This will remove every difficulty Then the  English  will be  of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came whose is the God over all blessed for ever  Thus the grand privilege will be inserted to advantage and stand at the top of a lofty  climax  rising from the Father to Christ and to God  We have indeed no copy to justify this reading  But the aforesaid considerations seem to make it probable the article  might be very easily transposed This is only my conjecture  Now I beg leave to ask whether our annotator was under an absolute necessity of conjecturing Conjectures I presume are  never admissible in criticism but when they clear the sense of an author from obscurity or when direct absurdities or considerable difficulties are removed by them Is either of these cases the case at present So far from it that unless we are to sacrifice sense to figure and real truth to ideal climax I affirm without ceremony the old and universal reading to be the only right one and that this passage abundantly plain and consistent in itself is here obscured by elucidation and marred by amendment Mr T in fact smothers himself in a dust of his own raising For though in a spirit of true compassion and in the tenderest affection to his brethren c the Apostle calls to mind their national character and many of the privileges they had enjoyed yet at the time of his writing this Epistle it should be remembered that their grand privilege of all as our author justly terms it that which the  Jews  constantly made their boast of and  which was indeed the glory of all their glories  was absolutely lost and irrecoverably  done away  for ever God was no longer  their  God in any sense favourable to them they were disowned they were  cut off  by him to use St  Paul  's words in another place the believing  Gentiles  were now  more nearly related to him  they  were  purified  to be a  peculiar people  and  Jews  as  Jews  had no manner of interest in the new dispensation so that according to this author's construction the Apostle falsifies fact and insults his  kinsmen  by way of commiseration  There is another text which the same author handles not less to his own disadvantage  Every house is builded by some man  says the writer of the Epistle to the  Hebrews  Ch iii  but he that built all things is God  Mr T's paraphrase is as follows  When he saith  every house is builded by some person but he who built all things is God  he evidently distinguishes between a  subordinate  and  Supreme  builder But this distinction he needed not to have mentioned had he not spoke of a  subordinate  builder before For if in the case under consideration there be no  subordinate  builder at all this distinction  is nothing to his purpose Then his argument would have been  Christ  must build the house because no one could build it but he seeing no house is built by any but God Whereas contrariwise he asserts a  subordinate  builder and tells us such a one is consistent with God's being the  Supreme  original builder  Now I take it this is a mere fanciful distinction of Mr  Taylor  's own brain The context runs thus  This man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God  Surely he  that built all things  he who made the world was the very Person or Being that  built the house  as the Apostle expresses it i e who founded the whole  Jewish  OEconomy ecclesiastical and civil and consequently though  every house is builded by some man  though every institution c has some author and  Moses  in particular may be said to be a founder in a secondary sense  Jesus  Christ  is strictly and properly the Supreme Architect as we may say as well in the one as the other of the above instances to the total exclusion of every idea of  subordination  And so this very passage in effect plainly asserts our Saviour's Divinity and confirms the  Supremacy  this Gentleman appears to be extremely forward to destroy by it It is remarkable enough that the texts under consideration have been before now a  snare  to unbelievers For the  Socinian  gloss on them is  that Christ is as much more excellent than  Moses  as God is more excellent than his own people  and this superexcellence is on all hands allowed not to come one jot short of absolute infinity  In consequence of the shifts to which infidelity is reduced it will add omit affirm and suggest sometimes arbitrarily sometimes imprudently and sometimes on weak and incompetent authority That passage in St  Paul  's first Epistle to  Timothy without controversy great is the mystery of godliness  Tim iii  God  was manifest in the flesh  c makes so clearly for us that the  Socinians  and they who patronise them struggle to get rid of it at all events And that they do so purely by the help of a supposititious reading which can be supported only by a strained incoherent and ridiculous construction according to which the  mystery of godliness  was  manifest in the flesh  and  received up into glory  c instead of  Jesus Christ  hath been abundantly shewn by many and especially by the learned Bishop  Pearson  in his  Exposition of the Creed  With a view to the elusion of certain passages in the  Revelation  which we have already produced as plainly expressive of the  Son's  coequal majesty with the  Father Grotius  has most unwarrantably assigned them their proper and respective  thrones  in heaven  He that sat on the throne c in primo solio id est Deus  says he in his paraphrase of Rev xxi  Supposing for argument's sake the merit of the  trinitarian  controversy to depend chiefly  on the authenticity of the seventh verse in St  John  's  st  Epistle there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one  See Mr JONES on this verse  I would gladly ask whether it is not in the nature of things at least as reasonable to suppose in general that this text was omitted by the enemies of the doctrine of the  Trinity  as that it was inserted by its friends And if so infidelity would appear at best to stand upon a precarious foundation as far as it depends on the spuriousness of this text and we should surely err with more prudence and modesty on the side of the Catholic Church than against her But an excellent writer  Mr Travis  has in his  Letters  to Mr  Gibbon  on this subject evinced the genuineness of this text to the intire satisfaction of every candid and impartial inquirer and particularly makes it appear that  the context of the Apostle is so far from receiving any injury by the retention of the verse in question that it would lose all its genuine spirit would become unapt and feeble in its application  and therefore could hardly be said to subsist without it  To this performance I refer you with pleasure  It has been urged and with an air of confidence that  Jesus Christ  cannot be an object of divine worship because in that excellent form of address to the Deity which he recommended to his disciples there is not the least mention made of himself nor the most distant allusion to his office and character A circumstance which has been considered as decisive in favour of  Unitarianism  Some persons have as  little  of  knowledge  as they have of  faith  in these matters At the time of his dictating this mode of prayer our blessed Lord was not properly speaking either the  mediator between God and man  or a  sacrifice for the sins of the whole world  Though therefore this form of devotion is used at this day with the greatest propriety imaginable yet it was originally delivered to the disciples for their own more immediate use as is manifest from the nature of the thing and from St  Luke  's account of this matter  It came  to pass  says that Evangelist  that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples  Luke xi  And he said unto them When ye pray say Our Father  c It was not till after his Ascension and return to his Father that they could properly pray  to  or  through  him that they were to  ask  in his  name  and to  receive  it was not till after he had  offered one sacrifice for sin  Heb x vii  and sat down at the right hand of God  that his mediatorial character commenced  in which he ever liveth to make intercession for us  There are two remarkable passages in St  Paul  's Epistles which as they are claimed by our adversaries with more appearance of right than the foregoing it will be proper to take into consideration  Who  i e  Jesus Christ being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation  c  Phil ii c  This text is often quoted as asserting the true Divinity of our Saviour I am therefore concerned to deliver  it from the construction which the  Arians  with much assurance put upon it and which many amongst ourselves have I think very unwarily admitted subjecting themselves thereby to the necessity of having recourse to a hackneyed and after all mere verbal distinction between  selfexistence and necessary existence  in order to reconcile their admission with orthodox principles  Thought it not robbery  c  i e says  Novatian  and many with him he never compared himself with God the Father  nunquam se Deo Patri aut comparavit aut contulit  the reason follows  memor se esse ex suo Patre  Every  Arian  will abide by this explication and how do the advocates for  Novatian  get clear of the imputed consequences Why says  Dr Waterland  this interpretation of the text supposing it just implies no more than this that  Jesus Christ  never pretended to an equality with the Father in respect of his  original  knowing himself to be second only in order not the first Person of the everblessed Trinity  Dr W observes that the whole passage in  Novatian  rightly understood  affords a strong proof of the coequality of the two Persons and that it is quoted accordingly by Dr  Whitby  in his treatise  de vera Christi deitate  But as this can only be done by help of the above distinction I must ask why  Novatian's  sense of this text must be admitted as the true one He did not  affect  say some did not  claim  did not  take upon him  c to be honoured as God Notwithstanding the great authorities of  Grotius Tillotson  and  Clarke  c  See Mr Parkhurst's Note at p of his Treatise on the Divinity and Preexistence of our Saviour  with which this interpretation is fortified I cannot help thinking the reading in use  thought it not robbery to be equal with God  not barely to be the more eligible but indeed the proper reading For not to insist on one circumstance in its favour which is the nonagreement of the several interpretations of the learned Gentlemen abovementioned it deserves to be noted that though the phrase  would admit the construction contended for yet the context will be found absolutely to revolt against it Granting the phrase  being in the form of God  to be  in itself of undeterminate signification yet when predicated of him who is  one  with the  Father  who  was in the beginning with God  and really and truly  was God  it certainly is to be regarded as synonymous with those expressions and consequently as importing an intire equality with God But herewith the construction of  Novation  and of the  Arians  not to say of Dr W himself is totally incompatible The reading in use therefore must be allowed to be not only natural but necessary  He thought it not robbery  i e to be no violation of right or justice  The other passage is the following  There is one body  says the Apostle to the Ephesians and  one Spirit one Lord one Faith one Baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all  Chap iv c The  Socinian  and the  Arian  inference from these texts is obvious but in proof that it is an unfair one I would remark that had St  Paul  intended here to have distinguished the  Father  from the  Son  and the  Spirit  by this ascription of Supremacy he would certainly have named the two latter with their severally discriminating inferior titles and this without a needless and I might say impertinent combination of  unities  if I may so call them Besides had this been the Apostle's design how comes it to pass that supremacy is in almost the same terms ascribed in the  New Testament  to  Jesus Christ  whose  throne is for ever and ever  who is  Lord of all who is over all God blessed for ever  Or how are we to account for its being so frequently said that both  Christ  and the  Spirit  as well as the  Father  is  in us  If the manifest attribution of Supremacy in the texts just now cited does not exclude the  Father  why must it be understood in the place under consideration to exclude the  Son  The same question may be asked with the same propriety and with the same success with regard to the following wellknown passages in the first Epistle to  Tim  which I believe the Antitrinitarians in general set with much assurance at the head of their authorities  Now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honour and glory for ever and ever  Tim i vi c  Who is the blessed and only potentate the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen or can see to whom be honour and power everlasting  Surely all this is  briefly  but fully  comprehended  in the above descriptions of  Jesus Christ  to whom by the way independently on the  Father  St  Peter  ascribes  glory both now and for ever  We shall now be able to despatch with no difficulty certain passages which at first sight have an humiliating tendency and seem to import the inferiority of the  Son  to the  Father  and the impersonality of the Holy Ghost It may be of use to expose pretences  With respect to his human character or his legation  Christ  is confessedly  God's  and the  head of Christ is God  and says he  my Father is greater than I  We have already seen that the absolute Godhead of  Jesus  Christ  though it had been on certain occasions not barely intimated but in plain terms asserted by him was not uniformly manifested to his disciples during his residence upon earth It was a truth which he was in due time fully to authenticate to them but which at present for obvious reasons they could  not bear  See Parkhurst's Divin c of Christ p c c  Accordingly as in many other places so in the words last quoted which were calculated to sooth them under the loss they were about to sustain by his  going away my Father is greater than I  the blessed  Jesus  with particular propriety alludes to the commission he had undertaken and adapts himself to their imperfect and unsettled conceptions  See Disc and See John xiv xv  On pretty much the same ground he had at another time declared to the  ruler  who addressed him under the character of  Good Master  See Luke xviii  that  there is none good but one that is God  The full manifestation of the great mystery of the Gospel was reserved for the  day of Pentecost  before which consideration a thousand difficulties  will crumble into atoms and by which an answer is given in full to the substance of what Dr  Priestly  has advanced in the  first Sect of the Introd to his History of  EARLY OPINIONS with respect to the silence of the  Old  Testament and the incompetency of a great part of the  New  This is life eternal  says our blessed Lord  that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent  John xvii  Our Lord speaking here in his human capacity and with reference to his mission very naturally avows his Father to be  the only true God  in contradistinction to all  false Gods  but cannot be supposed to exclude  himself  and the  Holy Ghost  who are partakers of one essence with the  true  So again  who is the first born of every creature and the beginning of the creation of God  Col i Rev iii  As to the latter of these expressions it implies no more according to some interpretations than the Father of the Christian  Church c or if the original word had been rendered the  cause  or the  origin  instead of the  beginning  as with very sufficient warrant it might have been this text is so far from affirming  Christ  to be a  creature  that in effect it avers him to be the  Creator  or if it be precisely equivalent to the former expression it will in course be reducible to the same signification Now literally and in his human character  Jesus Christ  was not the  firstborn of every creature  and in his divine character he was not born or begotten at all except in a transcendent and incomprehensible sense but he was and is styled in a few verses below the  firstborn from the dead  and in his own resurrection ascertained ours c And in this just sense he is the  firstborn of every creature  the  beginning of the Creation of God  or of the new creation and constitution of things not only without disparagement to his divine nature but in direct confirmation of it  So again  Of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven  neither the Son but the Father  Mark xiii  In our Saviour's human capacity or in his mediatorial character the final and general judgment was a matter that did not concern him but in his divine character he cannot but know the time of his own visitations  So again  Go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your God  John xx  These words contain a proper and natural commission given to  Mary Magdalen  by our blessed Lord in consequence of his resurrection and agreeably to what he had spoken  unto  his disciples  when he was yet in Galilee  Luke xxiv  It was his intention to signify by her the speedy accomplishment of what he had frequently foretold and promised them under the character of the  Messiah  but it was neither necessary nor expedient to discover to her singly the  fulness  of his  Godhead  So once more  When all things shall be subdued unto him  THEN  shall the Son also  himself be subject to him that put all things under him that God may be all in all  Co xv  In other words when the great scheme of man's redemption shall be completed  Christ  shall resign his commission into his hands from whom he received it and his mediatorial kingdom be succeeded by the eternal kingdom of God the  Father Son and Holy Ghost  with whom the  Saints  and  Spirits of just men made perfect  shall live in fulness of bliss and glory This is the obvious and indeed necessary construction For if we attend to the  letter  of this passage and not to the  spirit  and scope of it  when all things shall be subdued  c THEN shall the Son be subject c we shall assert that  Jesus Christ  will be  subject  to the  Father  AFTER the consummation of all things but was not so BEFORE or that he was greater in his  human  character than in his divine which is absurd  He must reign  says the Apostle just before  till he hath put all things under his feet  Now it is not literally true that he shall reign so long and no longer than this as the words  import For though his reign over the Church militant shall cease of his reign over the Church triumphant  there shall be no end  The truth is with the Evangelical plan with the commission of  Jesus Christ  the idea of subordination or subjection is connected but with regard to absolute perfection of essence and attribute the complement of the Godhead the Trinity in Unity ever was and for ever will be ALL IN ALL  Lastly with respect to such expressions as the following which appear inconsistent with personality  be filled with the Spirit  Ephes v  quench not the Spirit  Thess v  the Spirit which he hath given us  John iii  receive ye the Holy Ghost  John xx  c it is obvious to remark that agreeably to a common figure the cause and its effects are promiscuously used and accordingly by the  Spirit  in all these places and in all parallel ones we are to understand the gifts and graces of which the  Holy Spirit  or  Holy Ghost  is the dispenser If this interpretation  be not admitted we may with equal propriety and justice call in question the personality of  Jesus Christ  in his human character and even that of God the Father himself For  if Christ be in us the body is dead  Rom viii  and  God is a consuming fire  Heb xii  God is love  John iv  and God is in you of a truth  Cor xiv  On the whole then I may fairly conclude with remarking that for the most part in the arguments of  Socinians  we may be said to have  premisses  without  conclusions  and in those of  Arians conclusions  without  premisses  and that there is nothing in the feeble attempts the bold assertions or the  perverse disputings  of our adversaries I do not say to terrify but in any degree to discourage us from  striving together for the faith of the Gospel  even that  faith which standeth not in the wisdom of men but in the power of God  Cor ii  DISCOURSE VII  COR Chapter Verse  If Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead  THAT important article of our Creeds the  Resurrection of the Body  is the other great  mystery  which has all along been  foolishness  to Infidels and a  stumblingblock  to many Christians Under this article then I am to endeavour agreeably to my engagements to give all the satisfaction which the sensible the candid and the welldisposed can require  I might insist that the great doctrine before us is virtually at least contained in my text  but as there is a strong propensity in human pride to consider what is propounded to our faith as insulting our understandings it will be necessary to enter into a full and even minute discussion of the subject  A late ingenious author Dr  Sykes  very confidently asserts that this doctrine has no manner of warrant from scriptural authority He observes as Mr  Locke  has done before him that  there is not any such expression in the New Testament as the  Resurrection of the flesh  that the Scriptures often speak of a  Resurrection  and of the  Resurrection of the dead  but as to the  Resurrection of the body or of the flesh  there is not one word And therefore that such an article was required  at first  to be professed in order to Baptism can never be proved  See Enquiry when the Resurrection of the Body was first inserted in the Creeds sub init  I have already apologized for freedoms taken with the dead The names I just now mentioned are of the first authority with unbelievers at this day and I take a part in the controversy with a hope to conduct  it to your content if not by recency of argument or reply at least by the mode of their enforcement  Now that the above expressions or phrasesthe  Resurrection of the body  or  the flesh  never occur in the New Testament that this article together with some others which Dr  S  mentions did not make a part of the  Baptismal Creed  before the middle of the fourth century may without difficulty be admitted because if it will appear that the  Resurrection of the body  or  of the flesh  is most unquestionably the doctrine of Scripture and of the Apostolical and primitive Church we are bound by all means to retain it and its insertion into the  Creed  at  any  time was both proper and necessary the original  Creed  whatever it precisely was having been reasonably enlarged by Dr  S  's own confession as circumstances demanded and heresies multiplied  Let us enquire then whether the doctrine of the  Resurrection  as it is delivered in our  Creeds  be not founded in evidence rational scriptural and irresistible  If we consider this doctrine as a matter of opinion and not of faith we shall find it to have countenance in no contemptible authority Tho' the heathens saw  spiritual things  in general thro' a dim  glass  indeed tho' the prospect of futurity was greatly clouded to a world almost wholly corrupt in principle and abandoned in practice yet the notion of another state and even of a  resurrection  or of a  renovation  of all things which is a  resurrection  in effect was far from being universally exploded as absolutely ridiculous or chimerical We are assured  Zoroustres  taught the doctrine of the  resurrection  among the antient  Persians  as he himself derived it most probably from the  Jews  with whom he had communications  Grotius  who with respect to this article at least was not of  doubtful mind  in proof of the admissible possibility of the thing cites the authorities both of historians and philosophers and affirms it to have been the tenet of almost the whole sect of the Stoics  See Grotius de vent l and Le Clerc's Notes Prideaux Connect v p c  The Grecian  custom of burying the dead with their faces upwards and looking toward the rising Sun which is exactly the Christian mode has a very strong smatch of this sentiment  aa  'Tis observable  Mahomet  speaks in his  Koran  of the  resurrection  as of a doctrine known and received in the world from the beginning and far antecedently to the  Mosaic  dispensation This appears from the following passage  That this i e the doctrine of the  resurrection  is no other than fables of the ANTIENTS is says he the pretence of unbelievers  And indeed his learned translator remarks in his  Preliminary Discourse  that some of the  Pagan Arabs  believed neither a  creation  nor  resurrection  but that others believed both We are given to understand by a sensible writer that the first  Europeans  who visited  China  found many Christian truths intermingled with the trash of fable and tradition that the  Gentiles  of  Indostan  have confused notions of the Trinity and in particular that the people of  Ceylon  believe the  Resurrection of the Body  Jenkins's Reasonab c V p P on the Cr p  In his note at the th verse of the th chapter of Isaiah  Thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise  c the learned Bp  Lowth  observes that the doctrine of the  resurrection of the dead  must have been "a popular and common doctrine" among the  Jews  at the time of the delivery of this prophecy and we may reasonably make the same inference from a parallel passage in  Danielmany of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake c many  as I find it noted by the judicious commentator being here and elsewhere manifestly equivalent to  all  That the notion of a  Resurrection  according to the common acceptation of the term prevailed among the  Jews  in our Saviour's time will be soon manifest from certain occurrences and passages in the evangelical writings St  Paul  in his apology before King  Agrippa  affirms it to have its foundation in the  hope of the promise made unto the Fathers  tho' when where or in what manner he mentions not And certain it is that the  Pharisees  the  straitest  and most  considerable  Sect  among them not only entertained this notion with seriousness but contended for it with vehemency as appears from the violence of opposition between them and the  Sadducees  who as strenuously denied it What then did both parties understand by it Let us for a resolution of this question turn first to the account which the evangelists give us of a discourse held by the  Sadducees  with our Saviour on the subject of the  Resurrection The same day  says St  Matthew  and much in the same words St  Mark  and St  Luke  after him  came to him the Sadducees who say that there is no Resurrection and asked him saying Master Moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife to his brother likewise the second also and the third to the seventh And last of all the woman died also Therefore in the Resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all  had her  Matt c  The argument herein implied is indeed perfectly ridiculous and grossly carnal and is exposed accordingly by our blessed Lord in his reply to it but it undeniably supposes the  resurrection  of the  bodies  of these same  brethren  and their  wife  agreably to the  Pharisaical  hypothesis Indeed that very reply plainly supposes the same thing  Ye do err not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven  All this is abundantly confirmed by our Saviour's own argument immediately following  As touching the resurrection of the dead have you not read that which was spoken to you by God saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the living  There is neither connection nor indeed sense in this portion of scripturehistory unless we suppose the reunion of the  souls  and  bodies  of  Abraham  and  Isaac  c in the  resurrection  and that our Saviour  meant by implication to assert it For his argument directly proves nothing more than the immortality of the soul and its consequential existence in a future state But had this proof been the sole object of his discourse he would most assuredly have expressed himself in a very different manner upon the occasion Our Lord's meaning is yet more fully discovered by St  Luke  's account of this matter  Now that the dead are raised  says he according to that Evangelist EVEN  Moses shewed at the bush  saying c  Again When our Lord told  Martha  that her  brother  newly deceased should  rise again she said unto him  says the sacred text  I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day  John xi  Now that  Martha  believed her  brother should rise again at the last day  with that  body  which was laid in the grave and had been  dead four days  is evident enough from this consideration that though she appears to have been doubtful of the possibility of his resurrection at  that  time  and in so  extraordinary  a way  Lord  says she  by this time he stinketh  and this notwithstanding  her  avowed belief that  whatsoever  our Saviour would  ask of God God would give it  him and  his  declaration that he was himself  the resurrection and the life  yet when  Lazarus  actually  came forth  neither she nor the many  Jews  who were present shewed the least sign of amazement It does not appear that they were in any degree astonished at this mode of his restoration to life and therefore we may justly presume they were persuaded that  in the resurrection at the last day  "all men shall rise again with their bodies" through the operation of that omnipotent power which  in the twinkling of an eye  is able to inspire life and vigour into dust and ashes and animate corruption itself  The supposed  resurrection  of  John the Baptist  may be considered in the same point of view  Herod  hearing of the  fame of Jesus said unto his servants  as the Evangelist acquaints us  this is John the Baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty  works do shew forth themselves in him Herod  hardly thought these  works  were done by the spirit or apparition of the  Baptist  and if not we must conclude that he believed him to be risen indeed according to the notions entertained by the  Jews  The sacred history informs us the  Sadducees  were  grieved  that the Apostles  preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead  And is it not as plain as implication can make it that their doctrine was that the followers of Jesus and indeed all men should be raised in like manner as he was  The truth is of this kind of implied evidence we have plenty in the sacred volume I will only produce one piece more of Gospelhistory in presumptive proof that  Gentiles  as well as  Jews  understood by a  resurrection  what we do at this day St  Paul  concludes his discourse to the  Athenians  with insisting on the certainty of a future judgment from the  assurance  which God had  given to all men  of it by his having  raised that man whom he had ordained to be their judge  from the dead And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead  says the historian  some mocked  but  others said we will hear thee again of this matter  Acts xvii  Now St  Paul  's audience consisted chiefly of  Stoics  and  Epicureans  and the latter most undoubtedly were the party that derided the doctrine which the former did not conceive to be altogether extravagant or ridiculous But had the Apostle meant only to inculcate the general doctrine of a future state the  Stoics  in all probability would have been satisfied as to that point without a farther hearing and the  Epicureans  would have no more  mocked  or insulted than if a  Stoic  had preached it  Indeed there is one circumstance in the evangelical history which at first glance may be thought to militate against what has been laid before you When our Saviour  came down from the mountain  after his  Transfiguration  with  Peter James and John and charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the Son of man were risen  from the dead they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean  Mark ix  But that they could not possibly doubt what was to be understood by the expression or the thing itself is demonstrable from preceding considerations and therefore the case must have been this They were perplexed with the account our Lord had given of himself they could not conceive how their Master whom they still regarded as a temporal deliverer should suffer and be put to an ignominious death as he had assured them he should in the  st  v of the last Chapter or how the expected deliverance would be effected by or after such resurrection this was probably the subject of their enquiry they  questioned one with another  not what THE but what HIS  rising from the dead should mean  All this is perfectly consistent with a parallel passage in St  Luke He took unto him the twelve and said unto them Behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished  For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully intreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again And they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken  Luke xviii  What has already been advanced will obviate a common assertion or insinuation that there is a very material difference between the case of a body which has been dead a few days or months or even years and of one which has been buried in the earth many centuries since and that the same Power which is able to effect a  resurrection  in the former case cannot be conceived adequate to the like operation in the latter And indeed it deserves to be remarked that to maintain or to intimate this is at best to make extremely free with Omnipotence and in fact only begs a question instead of satisfying it Besides this expedient will appear to be heavily encumbered with strange inconveniences  to speak much less harshly of it than perhaps in justice I should When a finite understanding has laid the line which infinite power cannot pass it will have a fair claim to our attention although even were this done the number of instances we meet with in holy writ of the same identical body's being raised from the grave or restored to life which had actually deceased will however justify our supposition that the bodies of such as shall die within a reasonable time before the  last day  shall be raised after this  modus  or manner and agreeably to the common and natural ideas of a  resurrection  It will be hard indeed if our adversaries will not allow us to take this for granted and if they will the same understanding which is able to measure infinity can readily inform us how or whether with a body or without one the bulk of mankind shall appear at the great day of final retribution  I come now to revelation more clear and explicit to plain intelligible Scripture with respect to which it pains one to see so great a man as Mr  Locke  taking refuge  in the above distinction and indeed in the most pitiful evasions Observe then how this justly celebrated philosopher expresses himself in the passage following  In the New Testament wherein I think are contained all the articles of the Christian Faith I find our Saviour and his Apostles to preach the  resurrection from the dead  and the  resurrection of the dead  in many places but I do not remember any place where the  resurrection of the same body  is so much as mentioned Nay which is very remarkable in the case I do not remember in any place of the New Testament where the general  resurrection  at the last day is spoken of any such expression as the  resurrection of the body  much less of the  same body  I say the general  resurrection  c because where the  resurrection  of some  particular persons  presently upon our Saviour's resurrection is mentioned the words are  the graves were opened and many bodies of saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many  of which peculiar way  of speaking of  this  resurrection the passage itself gives a reason in these words  appeared to many  i e those  who slept appeared  so as to be risen But this could not be known unless they brought with them the evidence that they were those who had been dead c And it is probable they were such as were  newly  dead whose bodies were not  yet  dissolved c  See Essay on the Human Underst and ch on Identity  There is I persuade myself little or nothing in this passage but has its answer in the foregoing considerations unless we should be kind enough to acknowlege for argument the triumphant sneer of that parenthesis  wherein I think are contained all the Articles of the Christian Faith  It might therefore be sufficient to remark that Mr L seems to admit  mysteries  as some people dispense  alms viz grudgingly  or  of necessity  and at the same time to express our obligations to him for his indulgent concession that  bodies  have been raised from the dead upon  particular occasions  But because this great writer may possibly be still thought by some to have hit  upon an expedient which happily helps him out of embarassment in the stale distinction between a  particular  and the  general  Resurrection let us see whether this distinction will not vanish before the ensuing argumentation  I venture to aver then that the  resurrection  of the  body  of  Jesus Christ  is an especial earnest or sure token of the  resurrection  of our  bodies  from the dead I desire your impartial judgment of the texts which follow  Now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept  Cor xv vi  God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by his own power If we have been  Rom vi  planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus  Cor iv  As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he will  John v  These texts will be sufficient for my present purpose Let us consider them separately a little  Now is  Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept  I need not enlarge upon the  Jewish  practice alluded to under this figurative expression and shall only observe that as the  firstfruits  were offerings of that identical grain of which the harvest was to follow the  resurrection  of our  bodies  after that of Christ could not have been signified by a finer emblem  God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by his own power  i e most undoubtedly he will raise up us in like manner  If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection  The former part of this verse has some obscurity in it which may be liable to various construction but the latter ascertains almost as fully as words can do the great article before us  He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus  This text is exactly parallel with that just quoted from the other Epistle to the  Corinthians As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he will  This proof runs rather in another line but however  will terminate in the same point For we may safely conclude that the Son will  raise the dead and quicken them  hereafter in the same manner in which himself and many dead persons have been already raised We have by this time I hope sufficient grounds for this conclusion And indeed St  Paul  assures us that the  Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile body that  IT  may be fashioned like unto his glorious body  Phil iii  For how or when shall he do this if not in the GENERAL  resurrection at the last day  and by a change of THAT  body  which was deposited in the ground Our  vile body  is not to be  changed  for ANOTHER  body  but is ITSELF to be  fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body  Would it not be  prima facie  ridiculous to attempt torturing the passage to any other sense  Though what has been here offered can I think scarcely fall short of bringing conviction to a mind open to it yet it will be greatly corroborated by other passages and particulars and especially by the doctrine  contained  in the fifteenth Chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians  which is almost totally spent upon this subject In truth there are more reasons than one for our not passing by that Chapter If we read this portion of Scripture with due attention and impartiality we shall be led I presume to this unavoidable conclusion that the  bodies  of all men shall be raised if not absolutely totally or numerically yet really and truly the same as they died or in other words that the  bodies  which shall be raised shall with their respective souls constitute the same persons that lived before in the world nor can this doctrine be invalidated by metaphysical subtilties and  oppositions of science falsly so called  which are much less calculated to satisfy than to perplex and confound us If the import of such passages as the following  it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory  v c c  it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body behold I shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment  in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for  THIS  corruptible must put on incorruption and  THIS  mortal must put on immortality  if the manifest import of these texts can be evaded so may the most studied paraphrase or the most careful illustration of them There will be no such thing as intelligible language to be found The case is the human body undergoes many changes in a course of years e g from infancy to old age which I suppose it will be granted are the changes of the same body properly speaking still For though it may not be easy to say precisely in what the  ratio  of identity consists we may safely say than an almost infinite number of changes and modifications which might be supposed do not affect it There are very few names which have a stronger claim to deference than that of Mr  Boyle  and it is an observation of his that  there is no saying what the utmost human art or contrivance may be able to effect much less what means even physical  ones God is able to use for the reproduction of bodies of which the  necessary constituent parts  may be preserved consistently with numberless changes from the cradle to the grave and after death  Our great Creator at least knows what properly constitutes identity much better than we can tell him and therefore without entering fully into the state of the controversy as maintained long ago by Dr  Stilling fleet  and Mr  Locke  which would be little better than continuing a  game of words  I shall content myself with pointing out to you one or two instances of cavil and quibble and captiousness in the latter which plainly enough indicate him to have been galled in many places and are indeed altogether unworthy both of himself and his argument  The Bishop in vindication of his own and the catholic tenet cites these words of our blessed Saviour  all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth  From hence says Mr L your Lordship  argues that these words  all that are in the graves  relate to no other substance than what was united to the Soul in life because a different substance cannot be said to be in the graves and to come out of them Which words of your Lordship if they prove any thing prove that the Soul too is lodged in the grave and raised out of it at the last day For your Lordship says  can a different substance be said to be in the graves and come out of them  So that according to this interpretation of these words of our Saviour no other substance being raised but what hears his voice but what being called comes out of the grave and no other substance coming out of the grave but what was in the grave any one must conclude that the Soul unless it be in the grave will make no part of the person that is raised unless as your Lordship argues against me you can make it out that a substance which never was in the grave may come out of it or that the Soul is no substance  Ibid  But  will not this sophistical bubble burst in an instant before a most simple consideration pursued through its necessary consequences By a common figure and agreeably to the customary license of speech we talk of the acts or operations of one of the two constituent parts of man as of the acts or operations of the whole E G  No soul sees me  or  no body sees me every soul heard him  or  no body heard him  are expressions used indiscriminately not only in ordinary discourse but in correct composition The soul perceives the  voice  the body is raised by divine power and reunited to it  bb  Again The learned prelate quotes the following words of the Apostle in support of the doctrine of the  resurrection  as it is held in the Church  We must all appear before the judgmentseat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad  To which his Lordship subjoins this question CAN THESE WORDS BE UNDERSTOOD  OF ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUBSTANCE BUT THAT BODY IN WHICH THESE THINGS WERE DONE  A man Mr L answers may suspend his determining the meaning of the Apostle to be that a sinner shall suffer for his sins in the  very same body  in which he committed them because St  Paul  does not say he shall have the  very same body  when he suffers that he had when he sinned The Apostle says indeed done  in his body  The body he had and did things in at five or fifteen was no doubt  his body  as much as that which he did things in at fifty was  his body  though  his body  were not the  very same body  at those different ages and so will the body which he shall have AFTER the  resurrection  be  his body  though it be not the  very same  with that which he had at five at fifteen or fifty  Ibid  Now agreeing with Mr L and the admirers of his doctrine upon this head that  the body which a man shall have  after  the resurrection  according to their scheme for what shall be done  in  or  at  it we are left to conjecture I say agreeing with them that this body will be  his body  yet we would fain know in what sense he could be said to  receive the things done  IN IT  or  BY IT according to another reading A man has  his body  truly if not numerically the same through life under a greater or less variety of changes and modifications but by Mr L's train of reasoning it should seem that a man may have  his body  before he is in possession of it Had the Apostle said as a man sins in  a  body so he shall suffer in  a  body Mr L's mode of arguing might have been admitted but as matters stand at present it has evidently no logic to support it  Once more  The next text of Scripture you bring for the same body says Mr L is  if there be no resurrection of the dead then is not Christ raised  From which your Lordship argues IT SEEMS THEN OTHER BODIES ARE TO BE RAISED AS HIS WAS I grant other dead as certainly raised as  Christ was for else his  resurrection  would be of no use to mankind But I do not see how it follows that they shall be raised with the  same  body as your Lordship infers in these words annexed AND CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT WHETHER HIS BODY WAS THE SAME MATERIAL SUBSTANCE WHICH WAS UNITED TO HIS SOUL BEFORE I answer none at all nor that it had just the same distinguished lineaments and marks yea and the same wounds that it had at the time of his death If therefore your Lordship will argue from other bodies being raised as his was that they must have proportion with his in SAMENESS then we must believe that every man shall be raised with the same lineaments and other notes of distinction he had at the time of his death even with his wounds yet open if he had any because our Saviour was so raised which seems to be scarce reconcileable with what your Lordship says of A FAT MAN FALLING INTO A CONSUMPTION AND DYING  Ibid  The wit here is not worth answering and the fallacy of the paragraph was obviated in some of the foregoing observations Suffice it to remark that the addition of one word in its  proper  place would have demolished all this fine fabric of reasoning Mr L should have granted that other  dead  and BURIED shall "as certainly be raised as Christ was" In short we affirm on Scriptural authority that at the  last day  the  bodies  of men shall really be raised The article of the  resurrection  in our Creeds requires only this belief We are neither concerned in niceties of conjecture nor obliged to adopt Mr L's notion of identity  cc  But to return to Dr S I admit that this learned writer has speciously enough reconciled a text or two  See particularly Rom viii  to his favourite tenet which have been generally referred to the received doctrine But shall plausibility be obtruded upon us for demonstration Shall it overturn the credit of other interpretations  of the same passages more solid perhaps or at least equally ingenious Shall it supersede the authority of a very great number of texts too clear and explicit to be opposed by any thing but general assertions bold denials flat contradictions and the artifice of subtilization Shall it shake the faith of ages and nullify the doctrine of the catholic Church  And after all in this as in the case of the  Trinity  we are in effect only called upon to exchange one Creed for another These  squeamish  Gentlemen who know not how to  digest  the  wholsome  doctrines of the Gospel expect us to  swallow  with  greediness  a kind of spiritual  Nostrum prepared  by human imagination It is true Dr S with all the effrontery of  quackery  would make us believe his  dose  may be  taken  without any sort of inconvenience For he roundly asserts that  the  resurrection of the dead  is no ways liable to any of the difficulties which the other notion MAY be liable to  Now whatever  difficulties our notion  may  be liable to I ask whether that of the Doctor has not at first sight its  peculiar  difficulties Indeed it will stand clear of all if we answer the following queries suitably to the confidence with which he proposes them  May there not be a  resurrection of the dead  says he without the  resurrection of flesh  May not the dead person be raised to life and have a  body  given to him suitable to the place he is to have May not the  thinking conscious  person be restored though he has not that restored which has no thought nor consciousness belonging to it  To the first of these three questions I answer absolutelyNoA  resurrection of the dead  supposes a  resurrection of flesh  To the second and third I make free to reply with a few questions in my turn and desire to ask whether when the  graves and the sea shall give up the dead  they will not give up what was  put into them  Was this the  body  or was it the  soul  Or if by a  resurrection of the dead  we are only to understand our being invested with a  new  body  with what shadow of sense is this styled a  resurrection  Or if there is sense and propriety in the term may we not fairly ask from whence is  this body  to  come dd  If  thought  or  consciousness  constitutes person can  thought or consciousness  die If not what are we to understand by  a thinking conscious person's being restored  Restored From whence Or to what  ee  In short whatever becomes of man after death whatever may be the nature of the intermediate state what notion can we form of  thought's rising from the dead  or the  resurrection of consciousness  Men will advance inconsistences and assert paradoxes sooner than believe as the Church would have them  ff  This notion of a  thinking person's being restored  does indeed correspond well enough with an opinion maintained with much earnestness some years since by certain Divines  Dr Law Mr Peckard c  who held that during the state between death and the last day the soul will  sleep  as  it were and all the rational powers be suspended I shall not enter into the merits of their arguments It will be sufficient to say that these writers supposed the reunion of the Soul to the body at the day of judgment and consequently according to their notion for argument's sake admitting it the  restoration of the Soul  to its powers c and  the resurrection of the dead  are very different things  Again if we believe the Apostle's account the instantaneous change which is to be effected in us at the  resurrection  will be from  natural  to  spiritual  from  corruptible  to  incorruptible  but we shall look in vain for such a change under any other hypothesis They who insist that our souls shall be united to  new bodies  may be allowed to suppose such bodies will be  spiritual  as St  Paul  speaks and  incorruptible  but will they not be hard put to it to prove that  these  ever were  natural  or  corruptible  Or does this Apostle's illustration of the doctrine before us by the similitude of seed sown which  is not quickened except it die  convey the least idea  of a soul's awaking from sleep and in a moment as it were recovering the use of all its faculties Surely this cannot be the  mystery  which the inspired writer  shews  us in this chapter But according to our sense the Apostolical comparison is as apt and happy as possible The  bare grain  is  sown  dissolves and appears again under a new modification  So also is the resurrection of the dead  The body  is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption It is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory It is sown in weakness it is raised in power It is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body  a body subtilized and purified a body disencumbered from that  flesh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of God  and to adopt the high figuring of St  Paul clothed upon with an house from heaven  and arrayed with  immortality  And all this while in both cases  God giveth a body  as it  pleaseth him and to every seed  and to every individual  his own body  The learned authors we are concerned with and their numerous admirers seem to have forgot or to wish us to forget that they hold opinions declared to be heretical and condemned as such by an inspired Apostle The author of the Epistle to the  Hebrews  numbers the  resurrection of the dead  among the  principles  of the  doctrine of Christ  Heb vi  What was the precise tenet of  Hymeneus  and  Philetus  who asserted that the  Resurrection is past already  we cannot learn from the Apostle who so severely censures them But he describes them to be persons who  concerning the truth  had  erred  and  overthrown the faith of some  It is reasonably to be presumed that they as well as the old heretics  Basilides Carpocrates Menander Valentinus  c and the  Anabaptists  and  Libertines  of later ages as I find them called denied the  resurrection of the body  on much the same grounds as their successors in this heterodoxy It has been boldly maintained that by the  resurrection of the dead  we are only to understand  a  resurrection  from  sin  to a state of  grace  or a kind of  resurrection  from  ignorance  to a  knowlege  of truth or in general the immortality of the Soul  Libertini  says  Calvin  as quoted by Archbishop  Laud rident spem omnem quam de resurrectione habemus idque jam nobis evenisse dicunt quod adhuc expectamus c ut homo sciat animam suam spiritum immortalem esse viventem in caelis  And says  Peter Martyr  as cited by the same prelate  sunt etiam hodie Libertini qui eam irrident et resurrectionem quae tractatur in Scripturis tantum ad animas referunt  The  Gnostics  and  Valentinians  affirmed the flesh to be incapable of incorruption  Carnis salutem negant  says  Irenaeus dicentes non eam esse capacem incorruptibilitatis Menander  had the impudence to annex the privilege of immortality to his Baptism And among others probably the  Corinthian  converts affirmed the  Resurrection of the dead  imported no more than a  renovation of life and manners a newness of life  as St  Paul  expresses it and thus they absurdly confounded figure with letter or a type with its antitype  We should now see for full satisfaction's sake what the sense of the primitive Church was with respect to the doctrine before us but this enquiry affording ample matter for distinct consideration must be reserved accordingly  DISCOURSE VIII  COR Chapter Verse  If Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead  THAT the doctrine of the  Resurrection of the body  was taught by the Apostles and by our Lord we have already seen and that the Apostolical Fathers maintained it with the same precision will presently appear  Let us consider says St  Clement  in his first Epistle to the  Corinthians  how the Lord does continually shew us that there shall be a future  resurrection  of which he  has made our Lord  Jesus Christ  the FIRST FRUITS raising him from the dead Let us contemplate beloved the  resurrection  that is continually made before our eyes Let us behold the fruits of the earth Every one sees how the seed is sown The sower goes forth and casts it upon the earth and the seed which when it was sown fell upon the earth dry and naked in time dissolves and from the dissolution the great power of the Providence of the Lord raises it again and of one seed many arise and bring forth fruit  This passage is almost a direct comment on the th and two following verses of the th Chapter of St  Paul  's first Epistle to the  Corinthians  St  Clement  it must be confessed is not so happy in his elucidation of the doctrine of the  resurrection of the body  from the supposed death and reviviscence of the  Phoenix  from his own ashes according to a current opinion in those days the enlargement on which fabulous wonder has drawn a charge of ungenuineness on the Epistle itself  But the judicious Editor and Translator in his preliminary discourse vindicates the good  Father  and rescues the work from this imputation in a most satisfactory manner so that "with serious and ingenuous minds" to borrow his own words this is a matter which will reflect no discredit on St  Clement  's doctrine or on the pious zeal with which he maintained it The reality of the doctrine is in no wise affected by the whimsicalness or the weakness of the illustration  He that raised up  Christ  from the dead shall also raise up us in like manner if we do his will  says  Polycarp  to the  Philippians  Ignatius  assures the  Trallians  in the most positive terms that  as  Jesus Christ  was truly crucified and dead so he was also truly raised from the dead by his Father  after the same manner  as  he  will also raise up  us  who believe in him  gg  The following extract from St  Clement's  second Epistle to the  Corinthians  is at least as  full and express as the passage a little above quoted from the first  Let not any one among you say that this very flesh is not judged neither raised up Consider in what were ye saved in what did ye look up if not whilst you were in this flesh We must therefore keep our flesh as the temple of God For in like manner as ye were called in the flesh ye shall also come to judgment in the flesh  hh  And yet all this evidence shall shrink into nothing before a little ready confidence and unceremonious decision For thus says the Author of the  Inquiry  If we pass from the New Testament  Barnabas  and  Clemens  of  Rome  mention no more than the  resurrection  and not any particular  modus  of it or the  resurrection of the flesh  vide  Barnabas  ch xxi  Clemens  ch xxiv  Clemens  indeed in his second Epistle mentions the  resurrection of the flesh  but that is allowed not to be genuine  Ignatius  too speaks as the Scriptures do  Ep ad Trall  And in the larger Epistle to the  Ephesians  he speaks  of the resurrection    from the dead  but he never mentions any thing of a  resurrection of the flesh  Now if the passages I produced from St  Clement  's first Epistle and from  Ignatius  do not to all intents and purposes assert the  resurrection of the body  or  of the flesh  if St  Clement  's second Epistle must absolutely be pronounced spurious because the learned world is divided in its sentiments relative to it if the doctrine contained in this Epistle cannot possibly be agreeable to that of the other or to that of  Ignatius  or to that of the Apostolical and primitive Church because it is a matter of some doubt who the author might be if these reverend fathers speak in  no  place of the  resurrection  of the  body  because in  some  places they speak of the  resurrection of the dead  or of the  resurrection  in general as the holy Scripture itself occasionally does if this be the case equivocation shall hereafter pass for argument and dogmaticalness for demonstration  One should be apt to think that the nearer the fountain the clearer the stream or in plain terms that the most antient Christians are the most orthodox that those who lived in or nearest to the times of the Apostles and Apostolical men were like to understand their doctrine with readiness to embrace it with veneration and to transmit it in purity What can be more clear than the language of  Justin Martyr  as it is quoted by Dr S himself  Christ  shall come a second time when    he shall raise the bodies of all men that have been  Well but says our author  this was  Justin  's opinion but it was not in any  Baptismal  Creed he takes no notice of any article of any Creed as containing the notion of the  resurrection of the flesh  whatsoever his own philosophical notion of the resurrection might be  Will it follow then that the doctrine of the  resurrection of the flesh  was purely the personal or philosophical notion of  Justin  Martyr  because it was not in his time an article in any  Creed  If so it will follow by parity of arguing that almost all the other articles of our present  Creeds  were the private tenets or opinions of particular persons and not the common doctrine or belief of the catholic Church This must follow upon Dr S's own principles For he has himself remarked in his preface that  it is highly probable these referring to doctrines he had been mentioning and other doctrines were taught  viz  after baptism as circumstances arose either to explain some things inculcated in the Gospels or to avoid something erroneous And hence it was that the  original Creed  was enlarged and more things inserted into it and indeed all that has been added to it seems to have been owing to these causes  The just now cited declaration of  Justin Martyr  is therefore to be regarded as exactly coincident with a doctrine publickly received and not as the bare result of his own judgment for any thing Dr S has said or proved to the contrary But if so the doctrine of the  Resurrection of the body  or of the  flesh  was an article of faith from the beginning and its subsequent date as an article of any  Creed  is a circumstance of very inferior consideration What matters it to us  when  it was thought necessary to be required of the members of the Church of  Christ  openly to profess they believed as the Apostles and primitive Christians did  But let me shew you how unfairly the author of the  Enquiry  deals by  Polycarp  Of the two places in this  father's  epistle to the  Philippians  in which mention is made of the  resurrection  the principal I think is that I not long since quoted and will here lay again before you  He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also raise up us in like manner  The words  in like manner  are by the no less faithful than judicious translator printed in  Italics  as not been literally contained though necessarily implied in the original This passage then like many more parallel ones which I have had occasion to produce I mean from the Scripture itself manifestly  imports the  resurrection of the body  though should any person affect to doubt what the good  father's  meaning may be  here  they may soon learn what his idea of the  resurrection  was from a part of the prayer he preferred to God in the hour of his martyrdom according to the account we have of it in the circular epistle of the Church of  Smyrna  He  there  makes mention of the  resurrection  both of  soul  and  body  For though the  soul  cannot properly speaking be said to  rise again  yet as the soul and body constitute the same man as these constituent parts are separated by death and reunited at the  resurrection  this reunion is not unfitly expressed by a term that may be truly predicated of one of the constituent parts  Dr S admits the genuineness of the abovementioned narrative and yet will not suffer us to consider the  letter  in one place to be an explanation of the  sense  in the other There is more of art than honesty in an attempt to slip out of this difficulty by saying as the  Enquirer  does in the following words  that  by the time this letter was wrote the notion seems to have prevailed among Christians that the  body  was to be raised though it was not yet got into any of their Creeds  This is a sort of spiritual juggle which inverts truth and disguises it in the same instant it metamorphoses the real sentiment of  Polycarp  into a whimsical notion which began to gain ground in the Church  But this matter may be viewed in another light The force of truth has drawn from our author an involuntary cession of his own darling point For immediately after the sentence last cited from him he acquaints us that  soon after the middle of the second century disputes arose about the  resurrection  the  heathens  objecting to the possibility of it and the CHRISTIANS endeavouring to answer the objections they met with The enquiry says he was whether there was to be a  resurrection  of the  soul  alone or of the whole man consisting of body and soul And then a second question was whether the  flesh  the  very  flesh  which we now bear about us was to be raised up again The WRITERS of that time still extant contended for the  resurrection of the flesh  together with the soul But there does not appear to be any  Creed  which established such a doctrine For whatever PRIVATE PERSONS might imagine to be true was not instantly to be  professed  as an article of faith necessary to be believed in order to Baptism  And afterwards he tells us that  the controversy about the  resurrection of the flesh  did not begin till the middle or near the end of the second century And then as philosophers objected to the  resurrection  ITSELF from the common topics  how could  FLESH  devoured by beasts or fishes and thus become  PARTS  of those animals or perhaps reduced by fire to ashes or disperst by seas and rivers be restored Athenagoras Theophilus  and  Tertullian  undertook a defence of this notion and taught that it was no ways beyond the power of Almighty God to restore to every one the flesh he once had  Enquiry c p  ii  Now I desire to observe in the first place that these philosophers objected to the  resurrection  from the common topics just mentioned because they were the strongest that occurred to them and because when they objected to the  resurrection of the body  they most unquestionably meant to object to the  resurrection  ITSELF In the next place I would remark that if by the CHRISTIANS  who endeavoured to answer the objections of heathens  and by the WRITERS of  that time  we are to understand only a few PRIVATE PERSONS who maintained an extraordinary opinion if  Athenagoras  and  Theophilus  and  Tertullian  did no more than defend their own personal tenets it is passing strange these same heathen philosophers should set their  wits  against them at all and stranger still that the whole body of Christians had not joined the outcry in their own vindication and in public disavowal of an enthusiastic and ridiculous principle Nay this is not all The doctrine of the  resurrection of the body  if it was a mere private or personal opinion was in fact contrary to the Gospel of  Christ  and the sense of the Church and therefore must have been regarded as a most gross if not dangerous heresy But as it most undoubtedly was never represented so to be we are to conclude I presume that it was true and catholic doctrine notwithstanding its nonappearance in any Creed in the early ages and though the acknowlegement of it was not a qualification for Baptism We therefore insist that whenever it became an article of a  baptismal Creed  it was inserted with the most admissible pretensions  It is farther very observable that the doctrine of the  resurrection of the body  is most expressly taught in many places of the  Koran  of  Mahomet  Let us turn to a few  Man saith  says  Mahomet after I have been dead shall I really be brought forth alive from the grave Doth not man remember that we created him heretofore when he was nothing The unbelievers say when we and our fathers shall have been reduced to dust shall we be taken from the grave Man saith who shall restore bones to life when they are rotten  Answer he shall restore them to life who produced  "them the first time" kk  The whole system of  Mahometism  is you well know a superstructure raised upon the foundations of  Judaism  and  Christianity  The grand aim of the impostor seems to have been to concentre both in one faith with which view and that no romantic one he in part adopted and partly rejected the respective theories In order to ingratiate himself with the  Jews  he asserted as we have seen even to an extremity of zeal the unity of the Godhead and at the same time not to put the  Christians  out of all temper as he frequently takes occasion to speak respectfully of  Jesus Christ  so he declares probably in the most explicit terms for the great article we have been discussing  ll  We may therefore fairly conclude from this circumstance only that the doctrine of the  resurrection of the body  was not the sentiment of a few individuals but the profession of the universal Church at the beginning of the seventh century And after all supposing it to be questionable whether this were really the plan of  Mahomet  the least that can be inferred from the  perspicuity with which the doctrine of the  resurrection  is taught and enforced in the  Koran  is that he conceived it to be sufficiently reconcileable with the common reason and apprehension of mankind at the same time that from this among other particulars we must see and must desire its adversaries to take notice that it is not a doctrine peculiar to Christianity  To come now to the  conclusion of the whole matter  If  these things are so  if the great doctrines we have been handling are defensible upon sound principles and have a most firm foundation in Scripture and in primitive authority abundant reason have we to  hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering  in nothing dismayed by adversaries who trifle with us upon the most serious subjects who render the word of God of none effect by perverse interpretation who cannot or will not see the plain sense of the plainest expressions who will not acknowlege  Jesus Christ  to be the Creator of the world though  all things were made by him  or that he made satisfaction for sin though he was  sacrificed for us  and  gave his life a ransom for all  I know not any thing that can equal this stubbornness and slowness of heart except the insolence of such as gravely tell us we must not hope to propagate the Gospel among  Jews Mahometans  or heathens while the strange doctrines contained in our Creeds are retained in the Church Is not this to all intents and purposes saying we must not hope to eradicate infidelity till we have renounced the capital articles of our belief or in other words must not expect to make converts to Christianity till we cease to be Christians And indeed so inconsiderable are the impediments to a spiritual coalition between the followers of  Socinus  and the disciples of  Mahomet  that according to information given us by writers of credit terms of union and amity were actually proposed by the former to the latter in the last century  See Mr Jones's Introduc Disc p Note  That men should admit the mysterious truths of holy Writ upon rational grounds or that they should reject them upon what they call rational grounds  we may readily enough comprehend but there seems to be something unaccountably romantic in an attempt to compromise matters as it were with the author of our faith by accommodating these truths to the human understanding  But whatever may be the views or whatever the claims or whatever the pretences of Latitudinarians in general the notion of a  Creed  or a system or an establishment respecting the great doctrines we have been considering occurs to us in a manner spontaneously In the Church of  Christ  the only question ought to be not whether a  confession  a  formulary  or a series of  articles  be long or short simple or circumstantial antient or modern but whether it has its grounds in competent authority  mm  If the doctrines of the  Trinity  and of the  Resurrection  as they are held in the Church be scriptural doctrines no more objection can justly lie against the  Nicene  or the  Athanasian Creed  than against that of Dr S This author not only admits but refers to an  original Creed  which he observes has been  enlarged "as circumstances arose" or occasions called though that it has been enlarged in some instances beyond all reason he strongly insists with many  others with  him But be this as it may and even if  these things  were not  so  as we have represented them it is abundantly sufficient that they appear to be  so  to us No rule no system no establishment whatsoever can in any tolerable sense be said to invade the  right of private judgment  in matters of religion because  Creeds  formularies institutions and appointments in general must be incompatible with the exercise of this right at all periods of the Christian Church or at none It is pleasant enough to remark how  zealously  some will be  affected in a  ridiculous  thing  and how vehemently they will  beat the air  in their contention for that  right  of  private judgment  which is indeed unalienable and in fact is exercised by those who submit to what may be called  public  by men of all persuasions by  Jews Turks Infidels  and  Heretics  by the Sectaries of all religions and by people of no religion at all  nn  Not Heretics only says the great  Chillingworth  but  Romish  Catholics also set up as many judges as there are men and women in the Christian world For do not your men and women judge your religion to be true before they believe it as well as the men and women of other religions Oh but you say  they receive it not because they think it agreeable to Scripture but because the Church tells them so  But then I hope they believe the Church because their own reason tells them they are to do so So that the difference between a Papist and a Protestant is this not that the one judges and the other does not judge but that the one judges his guide to be infallible the other his way to be manifest  The fact is every man's attachment to any thing to this or that Church to this party or to that principle c is ultimately resolvible into his opinion of its excellence its truth its propriety or its expedience or of its conduciveness on the whole to his welfare comfort and satisfaction c i e it is resolvible into his own private judgment This judgment it is true may be warped by passion biassed by prejudice clouded by ignorance and blinded  by perverseness it may be intoxicated by voluptuousness enervated by indolence or inverted by frenzy or it may be influenced by wisdom by folly or by caprice But at the same time whether we judge well or ill or of whatever differences or degrees human judgment may admit we shall strictly and properly be found in all cases and instances to judge for ourselves    It was the concurrence of private judgment which first formed the Christian Church it was the same concurrence which gradually compounded the enormous mass of popery it was the same that effected the  Reformation  and it was the same that constituted the numerous sects and parties into which this  Reformation  has been most deplorably split and subdivided It is to nothing more or less than this that the Church of  England  owes her existence And upon this ground it is certain her requisition of assent to her public offices and of subscription to her  articles  the measure of just policy and common prudence for her security are no more to be regarded  as invasions of the  right of private judgment  than the open attempts or the secret machinations of her enemies for her destruction Upon this ground in short her declarations of faith in what she holds to be evangelical truth and indeed the whole scheme of her doctrine discipline and polity are perfectly intelligible and manifestly consistent But is not the inference drawn from the acknowleged  right of private judgment  by a late famous author and his associates altogether chimerical and totally incomprehensible Their inference is that every individual Christian may if he thinks fit withdraw himself from all the Churches upon the face of the earth stand absolutely single in the profession of his faith or as this author expresses it be a  Church to himself  See Confessional Ch p Note  And is not this in effect to assert that a Church may be formed without a communion without government or ministry without a possibility of being infected with heresy or divided by schism Is it not to all intents and purposes to aver that a society may subsist without members without establishment or  constitution We deny not that a man may judge he has a claim to this spiritual independence and indeed our principle supposes him so to judge but then we must beg leave to think in our turn that he is grossly mistaken in that judgment  pp  I wish to remark that if the capital truths of the Gospel are discoverable any where they are most indisputably to be found in the Catholic Church the great repository of Christian doctrine Our blessed Lord's assurances of superintendency support and protection are out of all question given to his disciples and to believers in general as to a body or society  Upon this rock  says he  I will build my Church c Lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world  When he promised his Apostles that he would send the  Holy Spirit  to them who should  guide them into all truth  he must necessarily mean that truth which they were to communicate to their successors and these to others and so on through all generations When the sacred penmen speak of the  truth  or the  faith  c they undoubtedly speak of the truth embraced and the faith professed by all sound Christians and when St  Paul  exhorts the  Corinthians  to  examine  themselves and to  prove  themselves  whether  they were in the  faith  he most certainly means the faith of the catholic Church In a word we must look for spiritual truth in its native simplicity though we  search  for it as for  hid treasures  we must look for it within the pale of some communion or other which surely will be acknowleged by every man who does not in defiance of Scripture and in contempt of all the world suppose that the infallibility which he justly denies to appertain to any Church upon earth is really and truly lodged in himself  The principle of the  Confessional  leads we apprehend to these absurd consequences but at the same time we assert no  dominion  over the  faith  or the consciences of others we leave every one to  stand or fall to his own master  we conceive that by the immutable constitution of things every one will think  and act for himself though we imagine all men to be accountable to God as well for their opinions as for their practices we neither do nor wish to  compel  men to  come in  that our Church  may be filled  persuaded as we are at the same time that this Church is in respect of all essentials an apostolical one that she  holds fast the things which become sound doctrine  and teaches the  words of eternal life  It may with great truth be affirmed that the Church of  England  asserts the  right of private judgment  in the same sense and to the same latitude that every party or body of Protestants does For how does the management of the several leaders and teachers of the Sectaries accord with this universally avowed principle How do  they  leave men to their own judgments in matters of religion Do  they  not find ways and means to become masters of the understandings and the consciences of their followers and accomplish that by indirect artifice which they load us with obloquy for doing under the sanction of lawful authority The fact is in case of superiority  any sect that you may name would think itself not barely empowered but bound to strengthen and secure itself by legal fences and establishments and by authoritative constitutions i e by those very means and methods against which it now so vehemently exclaims Experience will justify our supposition that such would be the case as we know the most considerable branch of the  Dissenters  to have changed its language and its sentiments with its situation The first article of the memorable  solemn League and Covenant  declares the intention of its framers to be  to  bring the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion  CONFESSION OF FAITH FORM OF CHURCHGOVERNMENT and DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP and CATECHISING  that they and their posterity after them might as brethren live in faith and love  It is pleasant enough to observe that notwithstanding the fine flourishes and colourings of certain authors who plausibly  profess themselves to be advocates for the common rights and privileges of Christians we find them sometimes driven out of their track by the irresistible force of truth and insensibly advancing▪ or admitting ecclesiastical notions we find them after all their efforts and struggles to climb over the pale of the Church unwarily or rather unavoidably slipping back as I may say into her fold and undermining their own principles The words of a late famous prelate  Bp Hoadley  upon this subject will verify the observation  As it is absurd says he to suppose that any man can be saved by the faith of another or by any belief but what is truly his own so there is no possible method of having a faith of his own properly so called without building it entirely upon what appears right to his own judgment such as it is after his best endeavours for INFORMATION  That is to say in other words a man cannot properly be said to judge for  himself  till he has received information or instruction from  others  In short let privileges be as sacred or consciences as tender  as you please I affirm that the erection and establishment of a national Church whether the doctrines she teaches are in themselves orthodox or otherwise true or false is as fairly defensible upon rational and protestant grounds as the institution of any religious sect or society whatsoever  True it is that men inflamed with false zeal or misled by wrong judgment may depart both from protestant and Christian principles and at their peril it will be The Church of  Rome  endeavoured to extirpate what she  called heresy  by the very same means which in early days Paganism employed for the overthrow of the Christian faith itself And what was the consequence The inhumanity of persecution afforded to every thinking mind a very strong argument of the corruption of that Church in which it was countenanced it frightened men  into  their  Senses  it helped to open their understandings and Popery may upon the matter be said to have been burnt out of the kingdom I undertake not to prove that in our own  Church zeal has always been sufficiently governed by prudence or tempered with charity There is no occasion to recur to a few disagreeable instances or the transactions of untoward times But I trust I shall be abundantly warranted in asserting that he who at this day shall charge the Church of  England  or any considerable number of her members with a want of due moderation  knows not of what manner of Spirit we are of  And yet if the author of the  Confessional  is to be credited we are relapsing gradually into Popery both in our doctrines and our practices We are given to understand in the seventh Chap of that work that  Some competent observers have grounds for more than a suspicion that the Church of  England  has been and still is though by degrees imperceptible to vulgar eyes edging back once more towards Popery  Sure these  observers  are much more  sharpsighted  than their neighbours I do not well know what these Gentlemen are afraid of but I know true Christianity to be most in danger from the diametrically opposite quarter not  so much from men of too great as from people of too  little faith  not so much from the triplemitre of the  Roman  pontiff as from the manyheaded  hydra  of infidelity The truth of the matter is the author before us and his friends do not speak out as our  open enemies  have done and as themselves were called upon to do by every maxim of justice candor and generosity They are in no dread of  fire  and  faggot  they are offended not by the  discipline  but by certain doctrines of the Church of  Rome  which we hold in common with her even the  doctrines  I have been defending and which they most insidiously and industriously labour to confound with the absurdities which are justly had in derision or in abhorrence among us and of which the credit visibly diminishes every day Errors may be grafted upon the stock of truth which in itself is not the less pure or the less amiable because it may be  holden  in folly as well as in  unrighteousness  To an ardent longing to see these common doctrines expunged from our  Articles  and  Creeds  we are unquestionably to ascribe that  profusion of spleen malevolence and rancour with which so many pages of the  Consessional  and of other treatises are shamefully defiled But for these doctrines I am thoroughly persuaded the reasonableness and utility not to say necessity of Churchestablishments would generally be admitted and even contended for That nicety of human wisdom which strains at two or three of our  Articles  could I am apt to think well enough digest the remainder of the  thirty nine  But as matters are circumstanced the principle I have been combating is far from being an unpopular one The privilege or right of private judgment in the sense of our adversaries reduces in some sort all men to an equality and is extremely soothing to vain and to weak minds The fact is there is no difficulty in declaiming from standing and specious topics either of eulogy or invective An affected zeal for reformation and an avowed anxiousness for the revival of gospel simplicity have a verv ingratiating tendency with the bulk of mankind  Liberty of conscience Freedom of sentiment qq ecclesiastical  tyranny violence of bigotry arbitrary injunctions spiritual impositions  c are I grant expressions sufficiently sonorous and amusing and may pass with many for argument though at the same time  looseness of principle stubbornness of schism rankness of heresy arrogance of selfsufficiency perverseness of opposition and petulance of temper  c are phrases which must be allowed by "competent" judges to sound quite as well and to mean full as much  To conclude That there is nothing in the least exceptionable in our whole ecclesiastical system nothing that might reasonably be retrenched nothing that could possibly be amended even in our  Articles  as well as worship rites and usages we by no means affirm but respectfully leaving  these things  to the consideration of them that  are over us in the Lord  we utterly deny that there is any thing fundamentally wrong or essentially erroneous in our spiritual constitution  rr  Men may be and we find them to be bigots in the cause of infidelity nor  can it afford the least matter of wonder if no regard is paid to the complaints or rather the  railing accusations  of such as under fair shews and pretences have manifestly  evil will at Sion  and while they profess themselves to be actuated by the  Spirit of liberty  appear to be really possessed with the  Daemon of licentiousness  I profess I see not what we can do for or with these determined enemies of our holy faith except praying in the spirit of  fervent charity  that God would be pleased "to bring them into the way of truth"  The Spirit speaketh expressly  says St  Paul that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing Spirits and doctrines of devils  Tim iv  This passage cannot possibly be considered as a dead letter and therefore it infinitely concerns ALL persons "diligently to try and examine themselves" in order to their moral assurance that it does not in any sense or degree touch THEIR spiritual state In general however under a conviction that we are ourselves in the  good and the right way  it will be our duty as Members  of the Church to wish and as Christians to pray that God would  have mercy upon all Jews Turks Infidels and Heretics that he would take from them all ignorance hardness of heart and contempt of his word and so fetch them home to his flock that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites and be made one fold under one Shepherd Jesus Christ our Lord  ANNOTATIONS  Page  a or misconstrued  Controversy in general may be said to subsist in a great measure by the pliancy of composition  Christopher Davenport  a  Franciscan  in a paraphrase or exposition of the  thirtynine articles  makes them all capable of a  RomanCatholic  sense and  Raynardus  a  Roman  likewise by a perverse interpretation converts every article of the  Apostolic Creed  into heresy or blasphemy The design of the latter is obvious enough I do not recollect to whom I am indebted for these particulars In like manner Dr  Waterland  acquaints us that  Franciscus  abbot of St  Clare  contrived to reconcile our  thirtynine articles  to the doctrine of the Council of  Trent  by dint of great dexterity and most amazing subtilty  as the learned Doctor expresses it  With respect to religious questions the  Romanists  in derision of the principles and pretensions of  Protestants  and by way of proof of the necessity of ecclesiastical interposition have all along called the Scriptures  mortuum atramentum  "dumb judges" c and assimilate the same to a "nose of wax" to represent their susceptibleness of any sense it may suit us to put upon them though at the same time none more than themselves endeavour to make advantage of their versatility This is apparent in many instances  e g  in their constructions of those texts by which they pretend to prove the doctrine of  extremeunction  of a  purgatory  c  The applications of Scripture made by the  Roman Canonists  are serioridiculous if I may so say beyond all conception They will prove the twofold power of the Pope from the  two swords  which the Apostles had when  Christ was seized by Judas  Christ said to  Peter Feed my sheep  in general not such or such a flock from whence it has been inferred that the Pope as successor to that Apostle is to be acknowledged the universal Pastor c

infallibility roundly deny that this great doctrine can be proved either from Scripture or by  consent of the ancient fathers  This as that great author observes is  doing the principal and proper work of the  Socinians  for them  I find the following extract from the  Racovian Catechism  made by the anonymous author of  Four Treatises concerning the Doctrine c of the MahometansSententia eorum qui Christo naturam divinam tribuunt est repugnans non solum sanae rationi verum etiam Divinis Literis  c" Hereunto the author subjoins two other similar passages the first from  Smalcius  a famous  Socinian  and the latter from  Socinus  himself The words of  Socinus  are these  Usque ad tempora  CONCILII NICAENI  et aliquanto post ut omnium qui tum extitere scriptis liquet ille unus verus Deus quem passim sacra testimonia praedicant solus Pater Jesu Christi est creditus et qui contrarium sentiunt ut  SABELLIANI  et eorum similes pro haereticis plane sunt habiti  Let us see then how Bp  Jewel  manages this matter against his antagonist Mr  Hardinge  who in his pretended confutation of the  Apology for the Church of England  confidently asserts that  the Divinity of the Holy Ghost cannot be proved by any express authority from Scripture  We find that illustrious prelate taking the wisest method of putting his adversary to silence and confusion by producing testimonies and opinions and not barely  concessions but strong asseverations of a directly contrary tendency from the writers of the  Roman  Church itself One quotation from  Nazianzen  is extremely remarkable and runs as follows  Dicet aliquis non esse scriptum Spiritum Sanctum esse Deum Atqui proponetur tibi  EXAMEN  testimoniorum ex quibus ostendetur Divinitatem S Spi testatam esse in sacris literis nisi quis valde insulsus sit et alienus a Spiritu Sancto  In short the various methods which have been taken by Papists to evince the necessity of admitting the infallibility of the Church and to discredit the authority of the evangelical writings are equally scandalous and pitiful You have them particularly enumerated by an author just now quoted and it will be sufficient to select one of them as it is a flagrant one I mean that of the Cardinal  Perron  who in the last century in order to render the Scriptures suspected and contemptible asserted that  some things in them sound like fables others are apt to raise in the mind indecent and dishonest imaginations as some expressions in  Solomon's song  the history of  Balaam's Ass  which spoke and the  jawbone  of an  Ass  with which  Sampson  slew a

Heretics would arise after the Apostles time and after the writing of Scriptures these cannot be discovered condemned and avoided unless the Church be infallible therefore there must be a Church infallible  To which Mr  Chillingworth  replies in these words  I pray tell me why cannot heresies besufficiently discovered condemned and avoided by them which believe Scripture to be the rule of faith If Scripture be sufficient to inform us what is the faith it must of necessity be also sufficient to teach us what is heresy seeing heresy is nothing but a manifest deviation from and an opposition to the faith That which is straight will plainly teach us what is crooked and one contrary cannot but manifest the other If any one should deny that there is a God that this God is omnipotent omniscient good c c that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the world and the Son of God if any man should deny either his birth his passion or resurrection c or  sitting at the right hand of God  his having  all power given him  c that it is he whom God hath appointed to be  Judge of the quick and the dead  that all men shall rise again at  the last day c c if a man should hold that either the keeping of the  Mosaical  law is necessary to Salvation or that  good works  are not necessary in a word if any man should obstinately contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture who does not see that every one which believes the Scripture hath sufficient means to discover and condemn and avoid that heresy without any need of an infallible guide If you say that the  obscure places of Scripture contain matters of faith  I answer that it is a matter of faith to believe that the sense of them whatever it is which was intended by God is true for he that doth not so calls God's truth into question But to believe this or that to be the true sense of them or to believe the true sense of them and to avoid the false is not necessary either to faith or salvation  It may be asked however whether this gives us satisfaction to the full Do not our  Creeds  and  Articles  contain particulars which we shall look for in vain in M  C  's list of the objects of faith Are not many whom we consider as heretics ready to subscribe to this list Was Mr  C  inadvertently or designedly silent with regard to these particulars Or are we to consign them to the class of obscurity Whatever might have been his motive to the wording of his paragraph in this manner or whatever was his personal persuasion in respect to the fundamental articles of the faith professed by the  Church of  England  the momentous import of the interrogatories I have just put must be visible to every reader  When Mr  C  or any body else tells us that  God does not require any more of any man than this to believe the Scripture to be God's word and to endeavour to find the true sense of it and to live according to it  or that  he that believes the Scripture sincerely and endeavours to believe it in the true sense cannot possibly be an heretic  See Relig of Protest p and end of Preface  he must be understood with qualification as asserting not absolutely that an honest man cannot possibly  err concerning the faith  but that error or heresy will not be imputed to involuntary ignorance or to sincerity of persuasion  Heresy says Bp  Taylor  is not an error of the understanding but of the will  and elsewhere  it is not the opinion but the impiety that condemns and makes the heretic  On this principle this sagacious and moderate writer condemns the  Heresiarch  whose error  commences upon pride and ambition c and excuses those who follow him in simplicity of heart  Agreably to all this Dr  Potter  author of the Answer to  Charity Mistaken  whose cause  Chillingworth  espouses and after him Dr  Waterland  quotes the following remarkable passage from  Salvian  an antient Bishop of  Marseilles  respecting the truly  sincere of the  Arian  persuasion  They are heretics but do not know that they are so In short they are heretics in our judgment not so in their own for they esteem themselves such good Catholics that they even throw upon us the infamous charge of heresy Such therefore as they are to us we are to them We know assuredly that they are injurious to the divine generation of the Son of God in making him inferior to the Father They on the other hand think us injurious to the Father in believing them both equal How they shall be punished at the day of judgment for this their error c no one can know except the Judge  It may be proper to take Mr  K  's argument and Mr  C  's answer into reconsideration  Heresies says the former would arise after the Apostles' time and after the writing of Scriptures these cannot be discovered condemned and avoided unless the Church be infallible therefore there must be a Church infallible  The substance of Mr  C  's reply is that  without any need of an infallible guide  the great truths of the Gospel are discoverable and consequently heresies avoidable by all such as  believe Scripture to be the rule of faith  and that with respect to those obscure places of Scripture" which Mr  K  tells us "contain matters of faith" we have nothing to do but  believe that the sense of them whatsoever it is which was intended by God is true  without being solicitous to avoid mistakes concerning them  By this answer 'tis certain this celebrated disputant seems to lay his own faith rather open to suspicion For does he not admit what he might and in fact ought to have contested Take them in the gross the  places of Scripture which contain matters of faith  are not by any means  obscure  but altogether plain and intelligible  I speak concerning  the faith of  the Church  What the sense of these places is according to the established laws of interpretation and according to the belief of the Christians of the first ages is a question to the determination of which we surely need not have recourse to infallibility Though therefore with respect to passages really ambiguous or  obscure  it will be a safe and excellent rule  to believe that the sense of them whatsoever it is which was intended by God is true  yet it will be unfair unreasonable and unsafe to apply this rule to places which are no otherwise ambiguous or  obscure  than as they "contain matters of faith" especially when we remember how frequently and how earnestly we are required to  strive for the faith  to  contend for the faith  and to  examine  and  prove  our  own  selves  whether  we  be in the faith  Truth is not less truth because it is held in a Church that pretends not to be infallible God  only knows the hearts of the children of men  but at the same time it will be no breach of charity to intimate that  every man  should  be fully persuaded in his own mind  that if he errs his error is an error not of his  will  but of his  understanding  CHILLINGWORTH  part    c    p  TAYLOR  's Disc on the Lib of Prophesying Sect    p  POTTER

many accounts is due to the names of certain persons eminent for their ability and some of them for their piety too who have advanced notions not a whit less eccentric or extravagant than these The late worthy Bishop of  Cloyne  who denied or at least doubted the existence of matter is not without his numerous admirers In fact he seems to have confounded all though he has convinced none But whatever purpose was intended to be served by such a doctrine surely its real consequences must be detrimental to the cause of Christianity If all about us is mere mockery and illusion the very foundations of all evidence all faith and all practice are undermined nor will it be possible to determine which position most contradicts my senses or offers most violence to my conceptions  that  which avers the nonexistence of matter or  that  which maintains the  transubstantiation  of it in the holy Sacrament The followers of Mr  Hobbes  will be apt to laugh this notion to scorn  under a persuasion that they deny or doubt the existence of Spirit and consequently of God with a much better grace It may be observed with regard to both extremes that there is no such thing as demonstrating beyond a possibility of doubt or contradiction For to use the words of an author of the last century  it is possible that  mathematical evidence  itself may be but a constant undiscoverable delusion which our nature is necessarily and perpetually obnoxious unto and that either fatally or fortuitously there has been in the world time out of mind such a being as we call  Man  whose essential property it is to be then most of all mistaken when he conceives a thing most evidently true  There is no shutting the door against scepticism We meet with doubters and disputers of all ages and nations  Marcus Antoninus  makes mention of one  Monimus  a  Cynic  philosopher who averred that all is fancy and that there is absolutely no such thing as a  criterion  of truth  Pyrrho  though not the first sceptic was famous enough to give an appellation to scepticism But notwithstanding all this a man of sense and of common prudence will listen to rational evidence and yield assent to moral certainty He will soon be convinced upon enquiry that both body and spirit exist and that mind is neither matter nor motion that if chance or nature if you please made the world it is that which preserves it too  and may dissolve it and after its dissolution may restore it to its original state or reduce it to one infinitely worse than the present This sure is at best but uncomfortable philosophy Not that I would hereby insinuate immorality to be necessarily connected with infidelity  Plato  distinguished long ago between the "ranting" and sober atheist and observed that a man whose sentiments are impious may be virtuous from constitution Accordingly he very justly resolves atheism into not barely depravity of manners but sometimes into an affectation of singular wisdom  See Letters on Infidelity p  One source of atheism in his opinion is  which is almost literally translated in the following words of the Apostle  professing themselves to be wise they became fools  Dr  Cudworth  seems unwarily to give some advantage to the atheist where he says that  when we affirm that God is incomprehensible we only mean that our imperfect minds cannot have such a conception of his nature as doth perfectly master conquer and subdue that vast object under it c  The case is we comprehend by our reason  that  God is though not  what  he is in respect of his essence in the abstract But that he is selfexistent from all eternity that he is a  Spirit  that he is the Creator and Governor of the Universe that he is all perfect are certain truths  notwithstanding the darkness which surrounds them  Sophocles  may be imagined to have had these truths in his eye when speaking of the divine edicts and the immutable decrees of heaven he puts this fine sentiment in the mouth of  Antigone    And yet we have wits and philosophers of great name and recent date who seem desirous of reviving the old atomical physiology which as Dr  Cudworth  expresses it  makes all things to be materially and mechanically necessary without a God  These gentlemen are at least far from pronouncing matter incapable of the privilege of thought One  Hume's Dialogues p  in direct terms calls thought the  agitation of the brain  Unhappily Mr  Locke  so far subscribes to this principle as to declare his opinion that  we have not sufficient knowledge to determine by the light of reason that God could not grant the gift of thought and sensation to a being which we call material  Mr  Voltaire  eagerly catched at this notion of the  sole reasonable metaphysician  as he calls him  MORE  's

Bacon  the former of whom in his treatise entitled  Motives to the Love of God  thus expresses himself  If I be not very much mistaken they are so who presume to give us satisfactory definitions of God's nature which we may perhaps more safely define by the impossibility of its being accurately defined Nor will an assiduity and constancy of our speculations herein relieve us for too fixed a contemplation of God's essence does but the more confound us  And then he refers us to the wellknown story of  Simonides  Agreably to these sentiments the great Lord  Bacon  says  If any man shall think by view and enquiry into these sensible and material things to attain that light whereby he may reveal unto himself the nature and will of God then is he spoiled through vain philosophy And hence continues he it hath proceeded that some of the chosen rank of the more learned have fallen into heresy whilst they have sought to fly up to the secrets of the Deity by the waxen wings of the senses  And  again "The prerogative of God comprehends the whole man and is extended as well to the reason as to the will of man  i e  that man renounce himself wholly and draw near unto God wherefore as we are to obey his law  though we find a reluctation in our will so we are to believe his word though we find a reluctation in our reason for if we believe only that which is agreeable to our reason we give assent to the matter not to the author c By how much therefore any divine mystery is more discordant and incredible by so much the more honour is given to God in believing c c  How do

of these subjects  It is ridiculous it is useless it is endless to start metaphysical questions which instead of clearing matters serve only to confound them It has been asked whether the Deity be naturally or morally good or whether he is  necessarily good and just in the same sense as he is eternal and omniscient  All speculations on such points as these are covered by the general idea of absolute inherent perfection Perhaps  Seneca  may be allowed to discharge this difficulty not unhappily when speaking of the Deity he says  Ipse est necessitas sua  The ingenious editor of  Puffendorf  's treatise  De officio hominis et civis  speaks much the same language in the following note  Deus intelligitur ad suarum perfectionum normam actiones componere Ipse  sibi lex est Ens natura perfectissimum cum Deus sit ideo quodcunque agit vel eligit non potest non esse optimum Itaque nugas agunt vel quiddam pejus qui Deum ens primum et summum virtutis et obligationis capacem esse docent  See Johnson's Note at Sect Book  But these last words seem rather obscure  To avoid making God the author of evil the doctrine of  Zoroastres  was that  God originally and directly created only light or good and that darkness or evil followed it by consequence as the shadow doth the person that light or good hath only a real production from God and the other afterward resulted from it as the defect thereof  An ingenious writer gives us the sentiments of  Plato  on this perplexing subject in the following translation  God is good He is not as many say the cause of every thing The good things we enjoy are to be solely ascribed to him but we are to search for another cause than God for our evils Or if we will say they come from God  Plato  quotes here the famous passage in  Homer  where mention is made of  Jupiter  's two Vessels the one containing good and the other evil c See  Plato  de Repub b and  Pope  's Note at v of th Book of the Iliad  some such reason as this is to be assigned We may say God does always what is just and good and the persons punished receive benefit by it but the poet must not say the sufferers are miserable and God inflicts that  misery on them if indeed he say the wicked as miserable stand in need of punishment and when punished by God receive benefit from it this may be permitted but we are strenuously to oppose any man who says God is the author of evil to a good man Such language is at no rate to be tolerated in a state  The judicious reader will see how little a way this theory goes towards clearing the difficulty but he will I presume acknowlege it goes far enough to convince us that  Plato  had  to speak modestly as precise ideas of the Divine nature as any modern philosopher  according to the translator's expression But in his  Timaeus  this famous philosopher imputes the origin of evil to the  necessity of imperfect beings  as Dr  Cudworth  expresses it  Wherefore says he though according to  Plato  God be properly and directly the cause of nothing else but good yet the  necessity of these lower imperfect things  does unavoidably give birth and being to evils  This is conformable enough to modern notions  Aristotle  seems to have thought the Deity to have been the cause or principle of all things without exception tho' in the following sentence he expresses himself in terms general modest and unperemptory    It is further observable that not only many heathens and among others  Platonists  but what is more extraordinary Christians also have asserted  the selfexistence and eternity of matter in order to account for the origin of evil and effectually salve the honour of the Deity God would have made  nihil non optimum  says  Hermogenes  as  Tertullian  represents his and his followers reasonings These heretics were called  Materiarii  It has been the opinion of some that God permitted the fall of man purely with a view to his redemption  See Catcott's Serm p  The author of  Deism Revealed  remarks "that there are two opposite and supreme principles according to the belief of almost all the Pagans now in the world  We are further given to understand by other authors that God's  absolute decrees and predetermination of good and evil  is the doctrine of the  Koran  in general though the  Mahometans  are divided in their opinions upon this article The sect of the  Hashemians  were it seems so afraid of making God the author of evil that they would not allow him to have created an infidel which was adopting something like the old  Magian  theory according to which there are two principles or a good and evil God who are in a state of perpetual enmity and opposition On the other hand the  Mozdarians  thought it possible for God to be a liar unjust c as the  Basharians  taught that  God is not obliged to do what is best and that had it pleased him he might have made all  men true believers  The  English  translation of a  Latin  version of an  Arabic  manuscript which contains a short system of  Mahometan  theology gives us a distinction upon the subject of the divine decrees as whimsical as it is unsatisfactory In the sixth section we have the following passage  God hath so decreed good obedience and faith that he ordains and wills them and that they may be under his decree his salutary direction his good pleasure and command on the contrary God has decreed does ordain will and determine evil disobedience and infidelity yet without his salutary direction his good pleasure or command it being only by way of seduction indignation and prohibition But whosoever shall say that God is not delighted with good and faith or that God hath not an indignation against evil and infidelity or that good and evil are from God so that God hath decreed and willed both with complacency in them he is certainly an infidel  Then follows in another character  Direct us O great God into the right way  A petition expressive of the author's perplexity  The general way both among Jews and Christians of accounting for the origin of evil is to derive it from the abuse of human liberty Let us turn to the sentiments of the learned  Grotius  upon this subject  Cum diximus Deum omnium esse  causam addidimus eorum quae vere subsistnnt nihil enim prohibet quo minus ipsa quae subsistunt deinde causae sint accidentium quorundam quales sunt actiones Deus hominem et mentes sublimiores homine creavit cum agendi libertate quae agendi libertas vitiosa non est sed potest sua vi aliquid vitiosum producere  Still will not this elastic difficulty return with full force upon us For may it not be asked who created men and angels and endowed them with this liberty Or could  either  have abused a privilege they never enjoyed Is there nothing of apparent causality in all this Indeed the learned author seems to me to be sensible of his distressed situation He observes very justly in the words immediately following those just cited that it would be impious to call God the author of evil  Hujus quidem generis malis quae moraliter mala dicuntur omnino Deum adscribere auctorem nefas est  But what does he say in the leading sentence of this very section  Neque ab eo quod diximus dimovere nos debet quod mala multa evenire cernimus quorum videtur origo Deo adscribi non posse ut qui perfectissime sicut ante dictum est bonus sit  Surely that same  videtur  betrays entanglement Let us just see now in what manner Mr  Leclerc  the ingenious editor of this work of  Grotius  illustrates this delicate passage  Praevidit quidem etiam Deus fore ut naturae liberae libertate sua abuterentur indeque multa mala et physica et moralia  eventura nihilo secius abusum illum consectariaque ejus pati maluit quam naturas libertate praeditas non creare Quid ita Quia cum natura libera sit praestantissima creatura quaeque summam opificis potentiam quam maxime ostendit Deus noluit incommoda ex naturae mutabilitate promanantia antevertere quia ea potest cum visum erit per totam aeternitatem emendare iis modis qui non nisi bonitati ejus convenientissimi esse possunt quamvis eos nondum revelarit  The very learned and equally pious Dr  Barrow  expresses himself on this subject in the following words  As for those real imperfections and evils moral evils habitual distempers irregular actions c we need not seek any one eternal cause for them though order and uniformity do disorder and confusion do not argue any unity of cause whence they should proceed the true causes of them are notorious enough the voluntary declining of men c from the way God doth prescribe them their abusing their own faculties c c As for other evils of griefs and pains incident to the nature or consequent upon the actions of any being they are such as God himself without any derogation to his goodness may in his wisdom or justice be author of for ends sometimes apparent to our understanding sometimes surpassing its reach It may suffice that God challengeth to himself the  being the cause of them  Shall there be any evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it Doth not evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Most High I am the Lord and there is none else I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil  See Amos v Lamen v Isa v We derive rather distress than content from all this nor to go a step farther shall we receive more satisfaction from St  Augustine  in the following quaint solution  mali nulla natura est sed amissio boni mali nomen accepit  or from  Wollebius  Divin Profess at  Basil  in the last century in the following distinction  non enim eveniunt viz Dei decreta necessitate coactionis sed necessitate tantum immutabilitatis  or from Mr  Whiston  in his observation that  whatever is evil must have been the consequence of man's fall and not God's introduction  We are reminded by these several particulars of the heresy of the  Marcionites  who no less absurdly than wickedly maintained that the God of  Moses  and the God of the Gospel were two different Beings the former rigid in his nature and vindictive in his proceedings the latter benign in his disposition and gracious in his

in our doctrines from the pulpit or the press respecting the Holy Trinity or the particular Divinity of our Saviour Infidelity is always on the watch and will take advantage in a moment of the least ambiguous or inaccurate or obscure expression which may fall from our lips or our pens Some of the Fathers themselves and indeed of our own most able writers sometimes speak unguardedly and inconsistently on these subjects For the sake of perspicuity and distinction as it should seem it has been said the  Father  is  selfexistent  and the  Son  or  Holy Ghost necessarily existent  which is in fact a distinction without a difference The  Three  Persons as constituting  One God  are equally  selfexistent  The  Father  the  Son  and the  Holy Ghost  are the Deity and every idea of originality derivation c evaporates in the consideration of a Trinity in Unity  Though it has pleased God to represent the relation which the Second Person in the Trinity bears to the First under the analogy of that of a Son to a Father yet we must not think that this analogy holds in every respect or that every circumstance of human paternity and filiation is applicable to the Divine  These are the words of a late worthy and learned writer who expresses himself still more happily in the following passage  It is impossible for God himself to reveal these things to such kind of beings as we are any other way than by accommodating himself to our conceptions and using such terms as bear some analogy to things known and understood by us  The Father says another able advocate for the doctrine of the Trinity is first in our conception of God and therefore when we speak of the Almighty or the eternal God and the reason is the same for the only God we primarily and principally mean the Father tacitly including the other two Persons  It is well observed by Mr Parkhurst that the first second and third persons in the Trinity are merely  theological  not  scriptural  terms Divin c of Christ p  But is the language of the author last quoted of a piece with this sentence when he talks of selfexistence or  unoriginateness  as the peculiar mode of the existence of the  First  Person Or is the writer first quoted perfectly consistent with himself when he concurs in sentiment with those whom he calls "the most zealous defenders of the  Nicene  faith" and agrees with  all  the antient writes who he tells us  hold the Son to be in some sense inferior to the Father and that even with regard to his divine nature  The Father says he is the first Person the Son the second The Father they  all  represent as unbegotten receiving his being and attributes from none but himself the Son they teach to be God of God begotten of the Father and receiving his nature c from the Father but yet coeternal and coequal with the Father receiving from him from all eternity the same intire and individed essence  Is not this language inaccurate incongruous and selfcontradictory" Many passages both in antient and modern writers are exceptionable on the same grounds To select a few The learned Bp  Bull  gives in his own words the following sentiment of  Petavius Nam ut recte Petavius non potest Filius a Patre gigni nisi ab eo naturam ac deitatem accipit  c St  Hillary  as quoted by the same author says in  libro de Synodis Patri subjectus est Filius ut auctori Russinus  in his treatise on the  Creed calls the Father the head of the Son  Cum ipse Filius sit omnium caput ipsius tamen caput est Pater  And  Damascenus  in his tract de  fide orthodoxa  has the following words  And St  Austin argute pro more suo  according to Bp  Bull's  remark observes in a discourse on a passage in St  Matthew  's gospel if I mistake not as follows  Insinuatur nobis in Patre auctoritas in Filio nativitas in Spiritu Sancto communitas in tribus aequalitas  It is Bp  Bull  's own remark  unicum esse in Trinitate principium principii expers nempe Patrem dogma fuisse in primaeva ecclesia tam fixumut in quadrigesimo nono Canonum qui dicuntur Apostolorum damnetur quisquis baptizaverit in tres principii expertes  Under the same article the learned Prelate observes that the antient Fathers and those of the  Nicene  Council and  Athanasius  himself never scrupled to give the appellation or title of the one only God to the Father Let the reader take his own words  Denique veteres Deum Patrem eo quod principium causa auctor et fons Filii sit unum illum et solum Deum appellare non sunt veriti Sic enim ipsi Patres Nicaeni exordiuntur suum symbolum  q v  Et magnus Athanasius quo nemo melius intellexit Synodi Nicaenae mentem c concedit Patrem jure dici    quod solus ingenitus sit c Propter Patrem vivit Filius  says St  Ambrose  as quoted by Bishop  Pearson quod ex Patre Filius est propter Patrem quod  ERUCTATUM  est verbum ex Patris corde quod a Patre processit quod ex paterno generatus est  UTERO c Dr  Fiddes  gives us a passage from St  Hilary  in which that Father asserts that  our making the Son God is no objection against the Father's being the one God He is the one God says he because the only underived God  Surely Bp  Pearson  himself who in the main is wonderfully exact does not speak in the most proper terms when he tells us that  the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is originally God as not receiving his eternal being from any other that therefore it necessarily followeth that Jesus Christ who is certainly not the Father cannot be a Person subsisting in the Divine Nature originally of himself and consequently it having been already proved that he is truly and properly the eternal God that he must be understood to have the Godhead communicated to him by the Father who is not only eternally but originally God that in him Christ is the same fulness of the Godhead more than which the Father cannot have but yet that in that perfect and absolute equality there is notwithstanding this disparity c c  To adduce only one example more even the judicious  Hooker  is off his guard in the following passage  Seeing therefore the Father alone is originally that Deity which Christ originally is not for Christ is God by being of God light  by issuing out of light it followeth hereupon that whatsoever Christ hath common unto him with his heavenly Father the same of necessity must be given him but naturally and eternally given him not bestowed by way of benevolence c  The priority implied in the term Father in its common acceptation accounts for all this incoherency but where I would gladly know do the terms  auctor fons origo principium  c occur in the Scriptures or in the writings of the apostolical Fathers  Clemens Polycarp  and  Ignatius  Or where are any terms to be found importing subordination and inferiority except such as evidently refer to the humanity of  Jesus Christ  And after all and all this put together notwithstanding the common resemblances by which the great mystery has been faintly illustrated by the Fathers especially by  Justin Martyr Tertullian  and  Origen  as light from the sun or a stream from a fountain are produced to no purpose as proofs of a subordination c For let light be supposed to have issued from the sun or a stream from a fountain from all eternity on this supposition it is plain causality and originality are merely nominal the fountain necessarily implies the stream and the sun light and in like manner in the case before us the existence of the Father necessarily supposes the existence of the Son  and of the Holy Ghost The Father can no more exist without the Son than the Son without the Father  The truth is the Fathers of the Church whose sentiments Bp  Bull  lays before us apparently grant much but really yield nothing If  Athanasius  e g asserting the eternity and Divinity of the Son of God meant not such an absolute coequality as entirely excludes all dependence and inferiority he flatly contradicts the Creed which goes under his name in which it is expressly said that in the Trinity  none is afore or after other none is greater or less than another  and if he did mean this we cannot argue against his faith from the carelessness or the impropriety or even the absurdity of his expressions Elucidation has before now been the parent of entanglement The  Arians  themselves are sensible they cannot admit the eternity of the Son of God without acknowleging at the same time his absolute coequality and therefore affect to understand every passage or phrase seemingly derogating from the dignity of  Jesus Christ  as a direct assertion or tacit concession that he is a creature Through a most strange inadvertence the writers we have been extracting from appear to have confounded the idea of temporal with that of eternal generation  It has been frequently and well observed that most of the Fathers before the Council of  Nice  speak sometimes of a temporal generation of the Son by the operation of the Holy Ghost on the blessed Virgin and sometimes by a sort of  catachresis  give the name of generation to the mission of the Son from the Father for the purpose of creating the world and that by directing our whole attention to the passages relative to both these the enemies of our faith have artfully attempted to prevent our notice or acknowlegment of other numberless places in the writings of these Fathers wherein they plainly and unequivocally assert the eternal generation of the Son of God  By help of these considerations and such as these we shall for the most part be enabled to reconcile exceptionable passages in the writings of the Fathers in general with the purest faith and strictest orthodoxy and shall have no cause for resentment or complaint if in so large a bulk of human composition and amidst such a multiplicity of subjects and circumstances we are sometimes surprized by inaccurate diction or unsound sentiment  The supposed canon referred to by Bp  Bull  which forbad the baptizing  on pain of damnation really maintains only the doctrine of the  Athana Cr viz  that  there is one Father not three Fathers  Tertullian  says somewhere that there was a time  quando Filius Dei non erat  which is true in the second or third sense of Sonship as there was a time when God was not a  Creator  viz ante mundum conditum  Nay there is an expression in  Lactantius  which more than insinuates that there was a time when even God the Father or God absolutely considered was not for says he  Deus ipse se fecit  And by the way they who talk of God the Father's  RECEIVING  his Being from himself alone  do but paraphrase the words of  Lactantius  I cannot think the Catholic faith can be in the least affected by these  early opinions  concerning  Jesus Christ  Metaphysical subtleties technical terms and unscriptural definitions and distinctions have undoubtedly done no small disservice to the cause of Christianity But as Dr  Waterland  repeatedly observes let the blame be laid at the right door These things were artfully and gradually introduced into the Church by heretics for the purpose of confounding and perplexing matters The antient Christians rested solely on the authority of Scripture and the concurrent voice of tradition  See Barrow on the Pope's Supremacy p  The Church believed in the Trinity believed in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy Ghost and worshipped all Three as One God before the distinction was expressed by the term  Persons  or the word  substance  was made use of "It does not appear" says Dr  W  that the word  Trinity  was yet applied to this case  viz  in  Justin Martyr  's time in the middle of the second century The orthodox were necessitated to contend against their  adversaries with their own weapons And what is worse terms of art have been the fuel of strife amongst the orthodox themselves It was a mere dispute of words which had like to have occasioned an irreparable breach between the Eastern and Western Churches Take the following account of it in the words of Dr  Potter  "The Orientals" says he  professing to believe three  Hypostases  in the glorious Trinity would not admit three Persons and were therefore thought to be  Arians  On the contrary the Western believing three  Persons  could not be induced to confess three  Hypostases  and thereupon were taken to be  Sabellians  Here was a great jealousy grounded upon a great error which  Athanasius  easily discovered and restored again their good amity and intelligence shewing that they differed not in judgment all meaning the same thing and that  Hypostasis  on one side was the very same in effect with  Person  on the other  Answer to Char Mista Sect p  A writer of the last century whose name does not appear speaking of the controversies with which the Church of  England  was agitated in the year expresses himself in the following manner  They be not of the highest nature for they are not touching the high mysteries of faith such as detained the Churches after their first peace for many years what time the heretics moved curious questions and made strange  anatomies of the nature and Person of Christ and the catholic fathers were compelled to follow them with all subtlety of disputations and determinations to exclude them from their evasions and to take them in their own labyrinths so as it is rightly said  illis temporibus ingeniosa res fuit esse Christianum  Farther it is certain the great doctrine of the Trinity hath been sometimes dishonoured if not weakened by puerile illustrations and playfulness of distinction According to  T Aquinas Trinitas est quasi trium unitas  It is somewhere observed likewise by this famous Doctor that the Father is the  beginning  but not the  cause  of the Son And says a learned systematical writer I think with a levity one should not expect in him  aliud est Trinus aliud est Triplex Trinum est quod essentia unum tres habet subsistendi modos triplex quod ex tribus rebus est compositum Deum trinum dicimus non triplicem et Trinitatem non Triplicitatem  To which is very sensibly subjoined the following caution  cum judicio legendi sunt Patres qui non raro sententiis dissident in usu vocum  Substantiae

second Person in the Trinity is that of Son of God Son in a transcendent and incomprehensible sense We are informed by St  John  that the  Jews sought the more to kill  our Saviour  not only because he had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his Father  thereby  making himself equal with God  It is worth observing that this translation by no means does justice to the original or any thing like so forcibly imports the equality in question    he called God his  OWN  Father  as Dr  Whitby  and Dr  Hammond  render it  his  PROPER  Father his Father  as  Nonnus  explains the words  in the beginning  John i  his Father  in a peculiar sense in  a sense necessarily implying the same nature in both The omission here is the more remarkable as our translators attended to the same emphatical word in the only place besides where it occurs and where its significance is not so obvious  He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things  Rom viii The  Socinian  evasion of the passage in St  John  is inexpressibly ridiculous and reduces it almost to nonsense  He made himself equal with God  by asserting that he did the works of his Father  See  WEBSTER  on John    See  WHITBY  and  HAMMOND  on John  v  See Dr W  LOWTH'S  Commen on Isai    Page    i of Divine Providence  The notion that by the  seven Spirits  here mentioned are to be understood  seven angels  who are the principal  ministring Spirits  of the Deity is countenanced by a no less respectable authority than that of Dr  Hammond  and Mr  Mede  But this is rejected by  Grotius  and by the anonymous writer whom I follow though under a different idea and purely from a general survey of the matter The writer I mean lays much stress on the number  seven  which in  Hebrew  denotes perfection  See Catcott's Serm I p  but his reasonings from this circumstance appear to me too weak a foundation for the support of a theory  Dr  Gill  without the least hesitation understands by the  seven spirits  the third Person in the blessed Trinity He has adopted the above idea and enlarged upon it "By these  seven Spirits"  says this very sensible writer  are intended the Holy Spirit of God who is one in his Person but his gifts and graces are various and therefore he is signified by this number because of the fulness and perfection of them and with respect to the  seven Churches  over whom he presided whom he influenced and sanctified c  The  Ethiopic  version this author observes reads  from the seven Spirits which are before the throne of Jesus Christ  It is farther a remark of the same author that the second Person is last mentioned in the benediction before us  because many things were to be said of him he is described in all his offices c  Bp  Newton  says in effect the very same thing According to him Jesus Christ is mentioned last  because the subsequent discourse more immediately relates to him  MEDE  Disc    B    p    See

Apostles or under their inspection were extant in the Church before any Gospel was published  Opinions are far from being concurrent with respect to the publication of the Gospels in general but this is a diversity which does not in the least affect our argument  See Bp Percy's Key to the New Test p c  Cosmas  of  Alexandria  it seems dates St  Matthew's  Gospel from the martyrdom of St  Stephen  and is generally thought to be as wide of the mark as  Isidore  of  Seville  according to whom it was not written before the reign of  Caligula  Perhaps the common opinion is the truest that it was wrote about eight years after our Lord's Ascension  It appears from the testimony of several old ecclesiastical writers that St  John  wrote his Gospel by the desire of the Bishops of  Asia Is cum esset in Asia  says St  Jerome et jam tunc haereticorum semina pullularent Cerinthi Ebionis et caeterorum qui negant Christum in carne venisse coactus est ab omnibus pene tum Asiae episcopis et multarum ecelesiarum legationibus de  DIVINITATE  Salvatoris  ALTIUS  scribere  How far the notion of  Theophylact  and I believe of some others that St  John  was particularly qualified to conceive and to teach evangelical mysteries by his personal purity c how far such a notion was wellgrounded or ought to be regarded as a mere fantasy I undertake not to determine  In  Hermannus Frank's  treatise entitled  Christ the Sum c of all the Scriptures  c there is an anecdote concerning a  Franciscus Junius  who was converted  from Atheism by accidentally dipping into the  New Testament  and reading the first chapter of St  John's  Gospel This says the author is recorded by  Theophilus Spizelius  in his  scrutiny of Atheism  He tells the story himself in his Life prefixed to his works printed at  Geneva    Mr  Boyle  in his  Considerations  c makes mention of the above circumstance as related somewhere by  Junius  himself and at the same time refers us to the history of a certain  Rabbi  who was converted to Christianity by reading the d Ch of  Isaiah  and to the conversion of St  Austin  who was "changed from a debauchee into a Saint" by a passage in the th Ch of St  Paul's  Epist to the  Romans  TOWNSON  on the Gospels p    See  LARDNER  and testimonies prefixed to St  MATTHEW  's Gospel in  MILLS  's Gr Test Prolegomena ad Commen in Mat  RANDOLPH  's Vindica pt    p  BOYLE  's Consid p incert  SEE WATERLAND  's Import of the doctrine of the Trin  Page  l the Son of God  It is excellently observed by the incomparable Dr  Barrow  that the first  Adam  derived his being immediately from God's power and divine inspiration that  Isaac Samuel  and  John the Baptist  had a generation extraordinary and miraculous as being of aged fathers or barren mothers by the interposition of Divine Power and that we cannot  easily conceive how the production of angels should be so much inferior to our Saviour's temporal generation supposing he had no other  It will corroborate what has already been advanced to remark farther that if Jesus Christ be any thing less than very God by eternal generation he was abundantly over paid for all he did and suffered for our sakes he was recompensed beyond all measure by his exaltation to the  right hand of the majesty on high  and by the divine honour and worship which has been universally ascribed and paid to him Under this view of the matter the assumption of humanity deserves not the name of a condescension In his human capacity indeed Jesus Christ  for the joy that was set before him endured the Cross and despised the shame  but in his divine he could have no  respect to the recompense of a reward  This is a thought which has been started and pursued by several writers  Equidem rem attentius

immersion at the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost repectively let us I think sufficiently into the sense of the Christian Church with regard to the equality of the Persons in the blessed Trinity It affords at least a most strong presumption which is greatly confirmed by the strictness of the  Apostolical Canons  which as Dr  Cave  acquaints us order  him  Bishop or Priest that neglects the trine immersion to be deposed Afterwards says the same learned Author to obviate the pretences of the  Arians  who used the trine immersion to denote the  Persons in the Trinity to be three distinct substances  the fourth Council of  Toledo  in their fifth Canon decreed that a single immersion would be sufficient that the dipping under water would express Christ's death and burial or descent into hell and the coming out his resurrection the single immersion expressing the  Unity  while the  Trinity  of Persons would be sufficiently noted by the  Form of words  in Baptism To this effect Dr  Cave  It is but reasonable to make allowances for the zeal or if you will the simplicity of the devout Christians of the first ages In process of time and as the Christian world grew darker and more corrupt many ceremonies and customs became  acts  of piety which were originally but its  appendages  I shall only mention one for example's  sake I mean that of praying with

Note at p of Parkhurst's Divin of Jesus Christ  it there runs  It seems  Athanasius  and  Gelasius  in his treatise  de duabus naturis  defend the first reading But both come to the same point  Jesus Christ  was  made  and  not made born  and  unborn  except in a mysterious and transcendent sense he was the eternal Son of God Or he was  made  or  born of a woman  through the operation of the Holy Ghost who  came upon  her who was  unmade  and  unborn  he was  both of  Mary  and of God  the latter clause being a kind of paraphrase on the former and so in effect  Ignatius  asserts here both the personality and the eternal existence of the  Spirit  There is another paragraph in this Epistle to the  Ephesians  wherein omniscience an essential property of the Godhead appears to be attributed in the fullest terms to Jesus Christ    Jesus Christ  is signified by the word  wherever it occurs in the Epistles of this Father I believe without exception and the context evidently patronises this application Arch Bp  Wake  seems to have overlooked the plain scope of this passage His translation runs "there is nothing hid from God c"  I had the satisfaction to find my sentiments exactly coinciding with those of Bp  Bull  upon this very paragraph His words are these  De Christo loqui Ignatium indubium est non modo ex voce    qua Christum ubique designat sed etiam ex toto Sermonis contextu de Jesu Servatore duntaxat agente  And it is yet farther observable that the introductory part of this Epistle as  Vossius  has remarked is rather obscure and that however it happened the Most Rev Translator has not done full justice to the plainest expression in it The  blood of Christ  in the translation is in the original simply the  blood of God    BULL'S  Defen Fid Nicae cap

altogether without peculiarities which are tinctured a little with the pious fancifulness of superstition This is more especially apparent in their notion of spiritual references and emblematical representations  The  scarletline  which the  spies  directed  Rahab  to fix to her window c is specified by St  Clement  himself  Epist to the Corin Sect  and by some others as typical of the redemption of mankind by the  blood  of Jesus Christ But of all of them except St  Barnabas Origen  is perhaps the largest dealer in symbol and allegory as has often been pointed out in numerous instances although it would be as unreasonable to object this in order to disparage the grounds of our common faith as it would be to  except with the same view against the eccentricity of some of this Father's tenets or those of any others in any other respects as e g that helltorments will not be eternal for which assertion he had certainly  no Scriptural warrant  or that the  angel  with whom  Jacob wrested  was an  evil  one which was likewise a notion of  Origen  's or that souls after their separation from bodies retain many corporeal properties as  Irenaeus  and  Tertullian  imagin'd c c In truth orthodoxy may be said to be built  upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone  and has no concern with these particularities and much less with the conceits which the luxuriance of piety itself has sometimes given birth to The Father I last named whimsically asserted that the devil invented  buskins  that a man might ADD TO HIS STATURE notwithstanding what our Saviour says to the contrary and gravely informs us in another place that this prince of darkness or one of his infernal ministers upon being exorcised out of a certain woman who was a frequenter of stageentertainments complained loudly that he was dispossessed of his property the theatre being his own ground  Clemens  of  Alexandria  advises us to  lay our heads upon stone  as  Jacob  did in order to our having visions c c But of such harmless extravagance infidelity strives in vain to avail itself  Whether St  Barnabas  who was St  Paul's  companion and fellowlabourer was the author of the catholic Epistle to which his name is prefixed is a question undecided at this day Much has been urged on this subject  pro  and  con  by learned men nor am I concerned to inquire on which side the arguments preponderate It will suffice to say that many have thought the allegorical interpretation of Scripture with which the performance abounds by far too imaginary or indeed too trifling for the pen of one of the  Minor  Apostles as  Vossius  calls him This able critic is however a strong advocate for him and the primitive fathers in general and gives it as his clear opinion that nothing of this kind in him or in St  Clement  from whom he extracts the particulars above noticed ought in reason to be alledged to the discredit of their writings His words are these  Quis a primis illis Christianis omnigenam scientiam et doctrinam expostulet Quis illos non aeque hallucinatos existimet atque eorum nepotes praesertim in rebus nihil ad fidem pertinentibus Nunquid et in Epistola Clementis similia occurrunt Quis enim bono animo concoquere possit fabellam illam quam de Phoenice narrat c Non puto etiam quemquam velle admittere

est Apostolus Non debent itaque in hoc reprehendere quod in altero excusant  Vossii Notae ad Barnabae Epist Cathol  But it should be remembered all this while that  Vossius  vindicates the authenticity of St  Barnabas  's Epistle so called by a very unequal comparison The Epistle of St  Clement  and those of other fathers are interspersed more or less with typical application but they are not distinguished by it  See St  BARNABAS'S  Epist particularly Sect    I would take this opportunity to observe that the doctrine of types and symbols as it has been revived by many moderns so has it by some been upheld with a zeal which in going beyond the bounds of judgment has it may be done disservice to Christianity Let me ask the most sanguin advocates for symbols and prefigurations how they relish this mode of speculation in the  Romanists  when among the arguments which they adduce in pretended proof of St  Peter  's primacy they tell us his SHIP out of which the Lord taught the people was an emblem or type of the Christian Church In short the doctrine of types in general is in my opinion too often at best more ingenious than solid and has a stronger foundation in fancy than in fact Perhaps the reader may be entertained as well as convinced by two or three select instances The coat of the  Jewish  Highpriest says Dr  Lightfoot  fitly resembled Christ's human  nature first as this was of one stuff without mixture so that without sin c secondly as this was put on after an extraordinary manner so Christ put on humanity by an extraordinary conception thirdly as was the edge about the hole to keep it from rending such was the unseparable union of Christ's two natures fourthly as were the bells and pomegranates such were his life and doctrine  Another learned writer Mr  Mede  speaking of the  manna  and the  rock  in the  wilderness  which are mentioned by St  Paul  as types of Christ Cor v expatiates in the following words  As  Manna  came from heaven beside the ordinary course of nature so Christ's birth was wonderful c As  Manna  was of a most sweet taste so is Christ unto the soul c As  Manna  was of a white colour so our Saviour was white and pure As  Manna  before it was eaten was brayed in a mortar c so was Christ our heavenly manna broken upon the Cross c As the  rock  gave no water before it was smitten with the  rod  of  Moses  so was Christ smitten upon the Cross that out of him might flow that sovereign stream which he who  drinketh  shall  never thirst  As the  rock  was smitten with the  rod  of  Moses  so was Christ our redeemer with the rod of the Law c With much more to this effect  According to a modern author Mr  Calcott  the  Jewish  tabernacle or temple was a type of the body  of Christ The  table  the  shewbread  c were all emblematical and significative of the properties c of  Jesus Christ  dwelling in a  tabernacle of flesh  The table e g was compounded of two sorts of materials  wood  and  gold  and it was a piece of furniture which exhibited a compound person c it was a type of that person who should be compounded of  Jehovah  and  Adam  God and Man In Mr  Bates  's  Faith of the antient Jews  the  right ear  is made to stand for  obedience  the  thumb  of the  right hand  for  actions  the  great toe  of  the right foot  for  ways shoulder  for  consent  c For farther satisfaction

the Church in general in the highest estimation They were written by men who it is well known were intimately acquainted with the Apostles  Polycarp  was a disciple of St  John  and his Epistle to the  Philippians  with the first of St  Clement  to the  Corinthians  were for several centuries publickly read in the  Churches of  Asia  See CH of WAKE'S DISCOURSE prefixed to his Translation of these Epistles  Their authority therefore is little inferior to Apostolical  I will transcribe a passage or two from the  antenicene  fathers and leave the weight of the whole with the reader  c says  Justin Martyr  Apol I c  says  Athenagoras    Legatio pro Chris  p Nothing can be more express simple and unequivocal than these declarations  And again in contempt of or rather in astonishment at the charge of Atheism which the heathens brought against the first Christians the same father asks    Ibid  p  Tertullian  calls the Holy Ghost  tertium numen Divinitatis and tertium gradum majestatis Irenaeus  calls the  Word  Dei aeternum verbum  See STEPHENS'S Ser on the Eter Genera who illustrates this doctrine by a multitude of testimonies from p to p  and according to him Jesus Christ is  Filius Dei existens semper apud Patrem  It may be proper to take notice in this place that the equality we are contending for is not in  the lest disturbed by the disagreement betwixt the  Greek  and  Latin  Church with respect to the  procession  of the Holy Ghost The doctrine of the former was that the  Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father by the Son and is the Spirit of the Son  non ex Filio sed spiritum Filii  esse dicimus et Patris per Filium  This doctrine is erroneous indeed but innocently so For as Archbp  Laud  See Laud against Fisher p  and many others have observed the question whether the Holy Ghost proceeds  a Filio  or  per Filium  is but a question  in modo loquendi  a mere difference in words and affects not the faith And therefore I cannot think Bp  Taylor  argues candidly or logically in the following passage  The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son which is an article the  Greek  Church disavows derives from the Tradition Apostolical as it is pretended and yet before St  Austin  we hear nothing of it very clearly or certainly forasmuch as that whole mystery concerning the blessed Spirit was so little explicated in Scripture and so little derived to them by tradition that till the Council of  Nice  you shall hardly find any form of worship or personal address of devotion to the Holy Spirit as  Erasmus  observes and I think the contrary will very hardly be verified  Bp TAYLOR on Lib of Pro Sect p  The Holy Ghost  is expressly styled by St  Peter  the  Spirit of Christ  which in the next sentence is said to have been  sent down from heaven  Pet v and I take it to be fully as presumeable that the article of the  procession  in question was grounded in the construction which this passage naturally admits as that it "derived from tradition Apostolical" notwithstanding the immaterial disagreement abovementioned But whether this difference with respect to the mode of  procession  took its rise from different construction or from diferent tradition the faith both of the  Greek  and  Latin  Church in the third Person of the Trinity was still built on a sure foundation Eternity of generation and procession and existence is equally inexplicable and though nothing was or in the nature of things could be  explicated in Scripture  in respect of the whole mystery yet I apprehend enough was  revealed  Even if the first Christians had not addressed the blessed Spirit in any form of devotion at all this could not have been owing to their want of comprehension of the mode of  procession  but to their disbelief of his personality and eternal existence But that the primitive Christians and the  antenicene  fathers believed the personality and eternal existence of the  Spirit  and consequently his coequality with the  Father  and the  Son  sufficiently I trust appears from the testimonies produced and therefore admitting  that most of the prayers of the Church were addressed to the  Father  and few only to the  Son  and fewer to the  Holy Ghost  which is far from being a matter unaccountable we have ample proofs that Christians worshipped  one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity  Erasmus  does not venture to assert that no addresses were made to the Holy Ghost and if he had we might confront him with the above cited declaration of  Justin Martyr  which at least supposes this Divine Person to have been included and frequently named in the supplications of the first Christians  c  But we are by no means destitute of antient testimonies to the same effect The accounts of the martyrdom of  Ignatius  and  Polycarp  conclude with ascriptions of glory c to the  Father  and the  Son  and the  Holy Ghost  See WAKE  's  Relation of these Martyrdoms p  The relation of the sufferings of the former closes with these words  who trod under foot the Devil and perfected the course he had piously desired in Christ Jesus our Lord by whom and with whom all glory and power be to the Father with the blessed Spirit for ever and ever  The Epistle of the Church of  Smyrna  to the Church of  Philadelphia  concerning the Martyrdom of  Polycarp  concludes as follows  We wish you brethren all happiness by  living according to the rule of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with whom glory be to God the Father and the Holy Spirit c  In  Clemens  of  Alexandria  there is a prayer and doxology to the Trinity in these words  Be merciful unto thy children O Master O Father c O Son and Father both one O Lord grant that we may pass the waves of this troublesome world continually praising and giving thanks to the only Father and Son to the Son and Father to the Son our Master and Teacher together with the Holy Ghost altogether one in whom are all things c c  Add to this that the doxologies in the antient Liturgies were some of them expressed in fuller and stronger terms than that used in our daily services  It is affirmed by Mr  Lindsey  in his  Apology  that the Fathers of the three first centuries were all what we now call  Arians  or  Socinians  We might ask this Gentleman in the words of  Dathan  c but on much better grounds  wilt thou put out the eyes  of Christians The assertion has hardly its fellow in the whole circle of polemical divinity Let these venerable Fathers speak for themselves I take this opportunity to put the reader in mind of the same Gentleman's very disingenuous translation of that passage in  Justin Martyr  's dialogue with  Trypho  where he tells him that there were those who admitted Christ to be the Messiah tho'  they believed him to be mere man The whole passage is perfectly scrutinized and a shameful omission of Mr  Lindsey  taken notice of in Mr BINGHAM  's Vindication of the Doctrine c of the Church of England  p  See also  Dr RANDOLPH  's Vindicat of the Trinity  part p and  Bp  BULL  's Judic Eccles Cathol  cap mo where he charges the  Remonstrants  with mutilating and curtailing this very passage With what face will Mr L lay  Socinianism  or  Arianism  at the door of  Justin Martyr  The passage quoted from this father in the former part of this note is so strong and explicit that it probably gave occasion to some  Socinians  to aver that HE was the first who taught the doctrine of the Trinity I said  some Socinians  because as we have already noted most  Socinians  and  Socinus  himself fathers this doctrine upon the Council of  Nice  with an absurdity which is exposed at large by Bp  Bull  in his Defence of that Council This duplicity is no small argument of  Socinian  distress  Dr  Middleton  in resentment I presume of that explicitness with which  Justin Martyr  in the place referred to and in many other asserts the doctrine of the Trinity and with a view to counteract it takes much pains to represent his interpretation of Scripture as frequently absurd and his doctrine as neither more nor less than refined  Platonism  But  the unfairness or rather the falsity of both imputations has often been shewn The  triad  of  Plato  whose admirer c this holy father it is well known before his conversion was the  mundane animative  and  intelligent  nature of God although it has been mentioned by some improperly but honestly enough to illustrate the doctrine in question with an intention to adapt it in some degree to our apprehensions could not possibly give rise to it It is as clear as words can make it that  Justin  the  Martyr  was a  Trinitarian  on principles very different from those of  Justin  the  philosopher  Dr M most uncandidly vilifies the typical and allegorical representations which occur often in this primitive writer and in which probably he gratified not so much his own taste as that of those early ages  Dr  Whitby  in his treatise entitled  An Endeavour to evince the certainty of Christian faith  c cites historians of credit who acquaint us that when  Julian  's design of falsifying the predictions of our Saviour by rebuilding the Temple of  Jerusalem  was defeated by miraculous eruptions of balls of fire c as the story is told by  Ammianus Marcellinus  and many others almost all the  Jews  who were eyewitnesses of this wonderful scene were converted to the Christian Faith and acknowleged Christ to be God The writers referred to are  Sozomen Nazianzen  and  Socrates  and the following passage seems to be as plain and decisive as can be  wished    It seems evident enough from these words that the  Jews  who were converted on this occasion and consequently Christians in general at that time acknowledged Jesus Christ to be absolutely God  Indeed the truth of this great doctrine is in some measure inferrible from the incredibility formerly objected to it by its adversaries  says  Celsus  and  Trypho  speaks rather resentingly in the following words to  Justin    Agreably to this the same  Trypho  declares that to assert Christ to have been born of a virgin is  Now I desire to ask whether the doctrine of a miraculous birth and bodily appearance of an  inferior  Deity for any supposable purpose whatever be not sufficiently reconcileable both with  Jewish  and  Pagan  principles and with what we know to have been the sentiments of  Julian  himself Or whether we are not in all reason to look for the chief ground of difference between  Justin  and  Trypho  in the coequality we are asserting This will appear yet more clearly in a subsequent note It is in short this equality which  constituted  superstitionis novae genus  as Christianity is called by  Suetonius  in the life of  Nero  Dr  Willes  in his first discourse prefixed to Sir  Rog L'Estrange  's translation of  Josephus  says that  Pilate  wrote to  Tiberius  de Christo Deo But where does he find this The Acts of  Pilate  so called are confessedly spurious  CELSUS  apud  ORIG l JUSTIN  's  Dial p LACTANTIUS l c and  Page  q the Atheism  The venom of this calumny soon spent itself and the honourable and oftennoted testimony of  Pliny  in his letter to  Trajan  that the Christians were a  simple  and  innocent  people who worshipped Christ as God at once vindicates their morals and declares their faith  The fact was the primitive Christians like their immediate predecessors the Apostles were reviled defamed and made as the  filth of the world and the offscouring of all things  they were charged with the most detestable vices with rebellion murder incest c and to free them from these infamous reproaches was one main business of the fathers in general and especially of  Justin Martyr Athenagoras  and  Tertullian  WHITBY  'S Endeavour  c ch p  Page  r principles of polytheism Hesiod  makes mention of many thousand Deities and  Varro  of three hundred  Jupiters  but both with a reservation of the properties and prerogatives of  the Supreme God These subaltern Deities were supposed to act as his instruments and under his direction Some of the wiser heathens however were ashamed of this latitudinarian system and pretended to resolve their theology into allegory c as  Zeno Chrysippus  and other Stoics and philosophers of later date found it necessary to have recourse to the same expedient to elude the charge brought against the multitude of the heathen Gods by Christians With respect to the Pagan notion of a subordination of Deities we may affirm in the words of Dr  Heylin  that God is not only  unus  but  unicus  or in the phrase of Mr  Hooker  that our God is one or rather very  oneness  in which essential unity says he a Trinity personal subsisteth  It will be well worth remarking that the doctrine of the Trinity has often been represented as having no little colour or countenance both from  Jewish  and  Pagan  principles A  Ross  See Note at No  in his  View of all religions  c undertakes to shew that  the doctrine of the Trinity was not unknown even by the light of nature to the Gentile philosophers poets c  Zoroastres  says he speaks of the Father who having perfected all things hath delivered them to the second Mind which Mind hath received from the Father knowlege  and power Here is a plain testimony of the first and second Person Concerning the third  Zoroastres  saith that the Divine Love proceeded from the Mind or Intellect and what else is this Divine Love but the Holy Ghost  He then proceeds to lay before the reader the principles of the  Chaldean Magi  who  acknowleged three beginnings to wit  Ormases Mitris  and  Ariminis  i e God the Mind and Soul" He observes that  Pythagoras  was not ignorant of this mystery when he placed all perfection in the number THREE and made Love the original of all things  He gives us the sentiments of  Zeno Socrates Numenius Plotinus  and many others  who write very plainly of the  Hypostases  c so that  no Christian can write more fully  Let us hear now what a much better known and an universally admired author has to offer upon the same argument From the three divine attributes of infinite Goodness Wisdom and Power the  Pythagoreans  and  Platonists  seem to have framed their  Trinity  of what Dr  Cudworth  calls  Archichal Hypostases  to which he supposes  Aristotle  may be thought to allude in the following passage in his book  de caelo  l c  the Pythagoreans    In another place this learned author gives us to understand that  Zoroastres  and the ancient  Magi  acknowleged the Supreme Deity under the different  names of  Mithras  and  Oromasius  which  Mithras  was commonly called  or threefold This it seems  J Vossius  would refer to the three  hypostases  in the Deity agreeably to the Christian theory but  Cudworth  thinks it to be more conformable to the  Pythagoric  or  Platonic  hypothesis of three distinct substances subordinate to each other This writer observes elsewhere that  Pagan  theology in general maintained a  Trinity  of universal principles or Divine  hypostases  subordinate the  or  EN called  and  or intellect  the second God and the mundane Soul or animated world  the third God According to the same author the  Crocodile  was a symbol of the first God of the Aegyptians  an animal which when in the water sees without being seen  and among the same people  a winged globe with a serpent springing out of it  was the  Hieroglyphic  of a triform Deity or Trinity of Divine  Hypostases  By the globe was signified the first incomprehensible Deity without beginning or end selfexistent c by the  Serpent  the Divine wisdom and creative virtue and by the  wings  that active Spirit which quickens enlivens and cherishes all things  Let us see now what was the theology of  Julian  and the latter  Platonists  This famous Apostate maintained that the inferior Gods were ministers of a supreme God He asserted that this Supreme God or first Deity and fountain of all things produced  from himself an eternal mind and a corporeal or "sensible animated Sun" as a great God in the visible world The latter  Platonists  in opposition to Christianity held that before the Trinity there was another supreme and highest  Hypostasis  existing and remaining in the  solitude of his own unity  as Dr  Cudworth  literally translates the words of  Jamblicus  This must at least be allowed to be language somewhat more intelligible than that of those old  Platonists  who taught that there is a substance a principle "in the order of nature superior to intellect" They suppose this first and highest principle of all to be by reason of its absolute and transcendent perfection not only above understanding knowlege and reason but above essence itself which by the way was the heresy of  A Joachim  condemned by the fourth  Lateran  Council Our Author very justly calls this visionary doctrine  mysterious Atheism  and it seems to have been adopted by that fantastic heretic  Valentinus  whose thirty Gods or  Aeons  were the production or offspring of a selforiginated Deity whom he calls  Bythus  or  i e unfathomable  profundity  or according to some of  profundity  and  silence  Even the theory of  Hesiod  whether literally or physiologically understood is much more agreeable to truth and the  Mosaic  history This old bard makes  Chaos  and  Earth  and  Tartarus  and  Love  the principles of all things  Theogon  v    and seq  In short the philosophy we have been just speaking of absolutely refines away all religion and the very belief of a God because Divinity in the abstract can no more be said to produce to act or to govern c than  wisdom  can be said to be  wise  or  motion  to  move  At best little solid or consistent can be extracted from this medley of principles and if we understand by  a Trinity  what in reason we ought to understand by it  viz a Trinity of three efficient living intelligent Persons the sovereign causes and rulers of all things  to use the words of a learned  See Extract from an anonymous Author quoted by Dr RANDOLPH in his Vindica p c  writer we shall look in vain for such a doctrine properly and precisely taught before the epoch of Christianity It is certain the antient Pagan Theology derived partly from tradition and partly from  Judaism  In the doctrines of the latter we are to look for the rise and foundation of the principal tenets of the Philosophers whose names have been mentioned of whom some are known to have had communications with the  Jews  What then were the sentiments of these descendants of  Abraham  heretofore with respect to the great doctrine before us The question is a material one and unless I greatly mistake the solution of it will terminate in a very satisfactory conclusion  Christian writers differ but little in what they  have advanced upon this head To take a few of them as they fall in our way  Wollebius  lays down the following principle as an indubitable one  Etsi Veteris Testamenti tempore doctrina S S Trinitatis obscurior fuerit non tamen plane ignota fuit  He then quotes the first  Chap  of  Genesis  and other passages in the Old Testament in common with other authors in support of his position or his  Canon  as he calls it and finishes the paragraph in the following words  quae testimonia tametsi pertinaces Judaei eludere satagunt Christianae tamen menti satisfaciunt  The learned Dr  Lightfoot  's sentiments on this subject which Mr  Parkhurst  has adopted or rather with particular warmth espoused are as follows  The very first thing says he that is taught in all the Bible  See Genesis c  is this very mystery  God  created  God i e the Word  said  and the Spirit i e the Holy Ghost  moved  So  Moses  also when he is to teach concerning the creation of man he first teacheth that it was the Trinity that created him  And God said Let us make man after our image  He saith  Let us  to shew the Trinity of Persons and he saith  in our image  not  in our images  to shew the unity of essence  The Trinity is supposed by Dr L to be declared in many places even at v of Deut  Hear O Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one  Dr L gives  this as the true reading which says he  teaches the Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity Three words answer the three Persons and the middle word our God deciphering fitly the Second who assumed our nature  This learned writer supposes the same mystery to be imported in the following among many other texts  Exo  v  Isa  v  Psalms  v v  Indeed Jesus Christ is by the almost unanimous suffrage of writers the  Jehovah  of the Old Testament The  Angel of the Covenant  the  Angel  who appeared to  Moses  at the  bush  the chief of the  Angels  who were entertained by  Abraham  c is generally supposed to have been the Second Person in the  See particularly ALLIX BULL JUSTIN MARTYR IRENAEUS and TERTULLIAN  Trinity A sensible writer endeavours to prove that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the  Law  and that it is in fact acknowleged and asserted by the  Jewish  Rabbies by  Philo  and  Maimonides  c The  Jewish Cabalists  says he  distinguish God into three Lights and some of them call them by the same names as the Christians of the Father the Word and the Holy Spirit and yet say that this does not at all break the Unity of God Your famous  Philo  says he expresses the same in many places  And he produces a considerable number of instances by which it appears that this celebrated Rabbin at least lays  himself open to the attacks of every Christian adversary  To the same effect Dr  Randolph  quotes a remarkable passage from  Eusebius  in which it is observed that according to the doctrine of the  Jews  there is after the Essence of God c a principle begotten of no other but the Father being firstbegotten c being the image of God the power of God the wisdom of God and the word of God the true light the  Sun of righteousness  c c  There are two striking passages the one in the book of  Proverbs  and the other in the  apocryphal  book entitled the  Wisdom of Solomon  which have been pretty generally considered as designative of the Second Person in the Christian Trinity  I was set up from everlasting or ever the earth was When he prepared the heavens I was there when he appointed the foundations of the earth then was I by him as one brought up with him c  Prov v  c When all things were in quiet silence thine Almighty Word leapt down from heaven out of thy royal throne c c  Wisd v  c  The anonymous Author of the testaments of the twelve Patriarchs who as Dr  Grabe  supposes wrote at the latter end of the second century makes every one of them foretell the coming of the Messiah and most of them in the plainest terms the incarnation of the Son of God or rather simply of God  All this put together intricate or incoherent as it may appear will be thought most clearly to import a Trinity of some kind in the Godhead and we may accordingly discern in a moment wherein lies the precise difference between the  Pagan  the  Jewish  the  Arian  and the true Christian theory By the hypothesis of each of the three former the Supreme God neither is nor can be more than One Person by that of the latter the Deity consists of three Persons and one undivided essence This as manifestly resists the idea of dependence and inferiority as the other is compatible with it or rather under the notion of a Trinity supposes it In short it will I presume be no easy matter to say what objection of weight  Jews  and  Gentiles Pythagoreans  and  Platonists  could have made to the Gospel what obstacle there was to their  becoming obedient to the faith without delay  except that the universally adopted principle of SUBORDINATION was superseded and effectually destroyed by the peculiarly Christian doctrine of EQUALITY  Perhaps I shall be thought to take upon me here the character of Moderator in the dispute between Mr  Parkhurst  and Dr  Priestly  I had no such intention But if what has been offered does not exactly coincide with the notions of the former it will at least in the result be subversive of the principles of the latter The Christian doctrine of an equal Trinity will be established by the acknowlegement  of a plurality of any kind respecting the Godhead by  Jews  antient or modern or both With regard to the notions of  Philo  c see Howes  's Remarks in Vindication of the antient Fathers  c p and seq  It is observable in conformity herewith that the Fathers in general consider the doctrine of the Trinity in the sense of the Catholic Church as that which characteristically discriminates Christianity both from Judaism and Heathenism With respect to the former  Tertullian  has these remarkable words  Judaicae fidei est res sic unum Deum credere ut Filium adnumera re ei nolis et post Filium Spiritum Quid enim erit inter nos et illos nisi differentia ista Quod opus Evangelii Quae est substantia Novi Testamenti statuens Legem et

our Saviour  Mary  is supposed to have conceived by the breath of  Gabriel  Yet in the nineteenth Chapter of the  Koran  the following inconsistent and impious expressions are put into the mouth of the Deity himself  We sent our Spirit Gabriel to Mary in the shape of a perfect man  Mr  Sale  observes that  Mahomet  's account of the delivery of  Mary  is like the fabulous one of  Latona  Both it seems were delivered by a  palmtree  and in the womb of the latter  Apollo  spoke as in that of the former say some did  Jesus  Possibly this may be a refinement upon the  Koran  itself or upon the circumstance of the  babe's leaping in the womb of Elisabeth  Luke i  See  Sale  's Note at Ch of the  Koran  Page  t God is one God  It is the tenet of all true  Mussulmen  says the author of  Mahometism explained  that the most abandoned sinners that ever existed shall be saved  provided they shall once during their lives have testified the Unity of God by pronouncing that fundamental article of the  Mussulman  belief  there is no God but  ALLAH and MAHOMET  is his Apostle  This  I conceive must be understood with some restriction and supposes no apostacy subsequent to the attestation in question For the famous  Mahometan  Doctor  Algazali  in his comment on these two capital articles of their faith delivers himself in the following words  He shall also believe that they that confess one God shall at length go out of the fire after they have underwent the punishment due to their sins so that by the favourable mercy of God no person shall remain in hell who acknowleged the Unity of the Godhead  The first  Mussulmen  gloried in the title of  Unitarians  upon every occasion Some of them carried their zeal for the grand article of their religion to a degree of savage ferocity We have a notable example of this in the history of the  Saracens  At the siege of  Damascus  in the reign of  Omar  the second  Caliph  after  Mahomet AbuObeidah  the commander of the  Saracen  army had granted quarter to certain citizens which was a piece of lenity so exasperating to  Derar  an officer of very high rank as to draw from him a declaration seconded by the solemnity of an oath that for his part  he would never have mercy upon any that said that God had a son and joined a partner with God  We learn from the anonymous author of  Four Treatises  c who assures us he derives his authorities from writers of the first class that the  Mahometans  carry this  unitarian  principle with them  literally to their graves His account of their funeral solemnities is entertaining enough but the following are the only particulars with which we are at all concerned At the interment of a  Mussulman  the  Muezzin  or Cryer must go before the corps reciting with a loud voice  there is no God but very God  At the close of the whole ceremony the defunct is addressed by the priest in these words  Be mindful of the covenant with which thou hast gone out of this world bearing witness that there is no God but very God alone and that Mahomet is his prophet and that Paradise is for certain and fire for certain and the resurrection for certain  c c  How shall we reconcile all this with Mr  Locke's  assertion that  to the light which the Messiah brought into the world with him we must ascribe the owning and profession of one God which the Mahometan religion hath derived and borrowed from it  Strange assertion The  Mahometan  faith is this that there is one Person in the Godhead the Catholic faith is this that there are three Persons in one Godhead Remove this difference and you will make a considerable breach in the  middle wall of partition  between the two religions  See Disc    th sub fin  Reasonab of Christianity p    Comment

Burlamaque  in his book entitled  Principles of natural and politic Law  observes somewhere that  moral maxims or actions are as certain as much dictated by pure reason as physical or mathematical ones  That the Creator e g says he is to be worshipped c by the creature is as selfevident as that the whole is greater than its parts Bp  Cumberland  calls the Law of nature immutable eternal and universal  Dissertation on the Law of Nature p  I cannot think Bp  Taylor  expresses himself with accuracy and much less with true casuistical precision in the following passage extracted by Dr  W Lowth  from the  Ductor Dubitantium  If we be sent to read the laws of nature in the tables of our own hearts where some things are disordered by passion many more  are written by interest some are indited by custom and others imprinted by education and amongst several men these are the authors of contrary inscriptions I say if we have no better director than this whereby to square our actions we shall find ourselves at a loss for the managing our behaviour in some of the weightiest concerns of life  The  inscriptions  of passion interest and custom c are not those  original  impressions which are still legible and sufficiently distinguishable by a candid and inquisitive mind The law of nature abstractedly considered is still what Bp  Cumberland  calls it  That obnoxiousness to error from which men of the brightest parts and the greatest professional abilities are not exempt is to writers in general at once an encouraging and an humbling circumstance  The corruption of human reason and the ignorance and error incident to our understandings  has says a most excellent author given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of Divine Providence which in compassion to the frailty the imperfection and the blindness of human reason hath been pleased at sundry times and in divers manners to discover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct Revelation The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or Divine law and they are to be found only in the  Scriptures These precepts when revealed are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature as they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity But we are not from hence to conclude that the knowlege of these truths was attainable by reason in its present corrupted state since we find that until they were revealed they were hid from the wisdom of ages As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original with those of the law of nature so their intrinsic obligation is of equal strength and perpetuity Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral system which is framed by ethical writers and denominated the natural law Because one is the law of nature expressly declared so to be by God himself the other is only what by the assistance of human reason we imagine to be that law If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former both would have an equal authority but till then they can never be put in any competition Municipal law is a rule of civil conduct This distinguishes municipal law from the natural or revealed the former of which is the rule of moral conduct and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct but also the rule of faith  See Commen on the Laws of England Sect p  These periods seem to have slipped from the pen The Scriptures are the Revelation of divine or supernatural truths but of the  original law of nature  they are only the revival or republication THEY plainly declare that to be the will of God which in  the times of ignorance  and corruption might rather be said to have been obtruded upon the world than recommended to it as the will of God by the philosophers  they  teach that by authority which before reason only dictated or opinion espoused so that now every species of immorality is totally without excuse Properly speaking it is not the Divine Will but the Divine Nature "which was  hid from the wisdom of ages  For though we have in Scripture only the  sure word  of morality yet  Socrates Plato  and  Tully  as far as they taught truly taught the morality of Scripture In a word Revelation is necessarily the rule of conduct but directly and immediately the rule of faith  The passages just cited interfered with the argument before me

Tragaed Incer v and Barnes's Note See Ibid v  Of all the heathens  Plato  perhaps had the most exalted sentiments and as a learned author expresses it "came nearest to the truth" He was indeed conversant in the  Jewish  Law to such a degree as to be described under the character of  Moses  speaking  Greek  according to the same author's observation from  Eusebius  and others He calls God  and emphatically the    Origen  cites this remarkable expression from him which is produced by  Grotius    But it may be this eulogy is premature  In the sacred commentary of the  Persian  rites the following words says  Sir Isaac Newton  are ascribed to  Zoroastres  O  c  This says he was the antient God of the  Persian Magi  The same great author acquaints us that  Hystaspes  father of  Darius  was cofounder of the religion of the  Persian  empire with  Zoroastres  which religion says he  was composed parly of the institutions of the  Chaldaeans  in which  Zoroastres  was well skilled and partly of the institutions of the antient  Brachmans  who are supposed to derive even their name from the  Abrahamans  or sons of  Abraham  born of his second wife  Keturah  and instructed by their father in the worship of ONE GOD  without images c"  See  NEWTON  's Chronol Ch    p    One is almost afraid to say this consummate Philosopher could himself be mistaken in this or in any matter could possibly be liable to the weakness of inadvertence or the littleness of prepossession Yet the author of the  Essay on Spirit  makes use of Sir  Is Newton  's words when he declares that  God is a relative term which has reference to subjects  Surely it has been observed with great truth that of all terms the term GOD is perhaps the most absolute It is the name of the Supreme selfexistent Being independently on ten thousand creations We know not wherein the essential happiness of the Deity consists but we know that the mere production of worlds contributes  nothing to it It is true God is our Creator our King our Father c but does he stand related to us under these characters by necessity or by bounty of grace We worship him as our Maker we honour him as our Sovereign we fear him as our Judge we love him as our Father c c but before the great day of universal manifestation we shall not  see him  and even then most probably shall but imperfectly  see him as he is  Page  y proof

their great philosopher who lived above five hundred years before Christ used often to say  It is in the West that the true Saint is to be found  and even before him it was a saying of  Laokun  that  eternal reason produced  ONE ONE  produced  TWO TWO  produced  THREE  and  THREE  produced all things  How far the conclusion of  Simplicius  's comment upon  Epictetus  may deserve more attention I will not determine It is to be found in Dr CAVE  's Prim Christian  being a prayer  in which mention is made of three Persons the  Lord  or Father the  Saviour  or Christ and the  light of truth  which even in Scripture says Dr C is "a common periphrasis of the Holy Spirit" If we may believe  Socrates  in his Ecclesiastical History as the same author  refers to him  Ignatius  heard the angels in a vision praising the Trinity in alternate hymns c which introduced alternate hymns into the Church Mr  Hooker  seems inclined to suspect the authority of this story and it is certain nothing is said relative to such a vision in all the genuine epistles of this antient Father which are seven though in one of them viz that to the  Ephesians  he talks of  Jesus Christ's being sung and of singing to the Father by Jesus Christ  Sect  which makes the omission more extraordinary  The absolute Divinity of  Jesus Christ  has with more haste than judgment been asserted by some from our Saviour's words to the  leper I will be thou clean  and by others from his  power to forgive sins  nothing in all this implying a selfinherent authority Dr  Whitby  quotes the following passage from a no less illustrious Father than  Irenaeus  with respect to the  remitting power  By remitting the sin c he shewed who he was for if none can remit sins but God and yet our Lord did remit them c it is manifest that he was both the  Word of God  and the  Son of man  receiving the power of remission from his Father as God and Man  Surely he could  receive  this power as man only  It is not my intention to derogate in the least from the merit of Mr  Jones  's performance the  Catholic Doctrine of a Trinity  which upon the whole is admirable and satisfactory His scriptural parallels are for the most part happy and his mode of reasoning is always ingenious and generally conclusive Perhaps it rather fails in the application of the following text  God was  IN CHRIST  reconciling the world to  HIMSELF Cor  It is allowed on all hands says Mr  Jones  that the  world  was reconciled by Christ Jesus to the  one only great and supreme God  But this very  same God  for the word is but once used in the whole sentence was  in  Christ manifest  in  the flesh and  reconciling the world to himself  And were there no other passage of Scripture to be found this alone is sufficient to overthrow the whole doctrine of  Arianism  which as far as the Scripture is concerned depends upon this one assertion that  the word  GOD  in Scripture  NEVER  signifies a complex notion of more persons than one but  ALWAYS  means one person only viz either the person of the Father singly or the person of the Son singly  Which is absolutely false for here it signifies  both  The text considers God as agent and patient at the same time and upon the same occasion as the  reconciler  of the world in the  person  of the  Son  and the object to whom the  reconciliation was made  in the  person  of the  Father  yet there is but one word GOD to express them  both So that the word God though of the  singular  number is of a  plural  comprehension And thus I find it to have been taken by some of the most eminent writers before the council of  Nice Plasmatus in initio homo per manus  DEI id est FILII et SPIRITUS says  Irenaeus  putting the singular name of God for the  two persons  of the  Son  and  Spirit  And the same word in the language of  Origen  if we are allowed to take the version of  Ruffinus  as genuine includes the whole  three  persons  igitur de  DEO  id est  de PATRE  et  FILIO  et  SPIRITU SANCTO And our excellent church has used the word  God  in the same comprehensive sense as in the  Blessing  after the communion service GOD ALMIGHTY  the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost  I am afraid this is not so full an answer to the above assertion as was to be wished and that it is not absolutely sufficient for the "overthrow of the whole doctrine of  Arianism"  In the first place Dr  Clarke's  proselytes will be apt to insist that the whole doctrine of  Arianism  does not depend upon this one assertion and in the next place that if it did Mr  Jones  has advanced nothing here forcible enough to overthrow it It is true they will say  God was in Christ  but in what sense why by his grace his influence and spiritual communications as he is likewise said to be  in  us and as Christ is said to be  in  us and as we are said to  be  in  God and to be  in  Christ by the purity of our hearts and affections This they will tell us is plain simple theory without any wanton refinement or imaginary distinction of "agent and patient c" And with regard to the authorities of  Irenaeus Origen  and the  Blessing  in the Communion service they will add that they cannot admit either a private sentiment or a public doctrine to be the standard of true Chistianity  As this is specious enough it may be proper to disencumber ourselves from the weight of this same  Arian  assertion by other considerations  Hac non successit alia progrediamur via  First then let it be observed that though the  English  word  God  be "of the  singular  number" yet the  Hebrew  word  Elohim  of which it is the translation is confessedly "of a  plural  comprehension" Accordingly it has been demonstrated over and over again that the ancient  Jews  held a plurality of some kind in the Deity  Vid Supr  But secondly we may recur to considerations still more internal and indisputable If it has been abundantly made to appear that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost is God as properly and truly as the Father is God the term God must unavoidably be acknowleged to include or to "signify a complex notion of  more persons than one"  in many places of holy writ It will suffice to produce  a few instances The Father is said to be  in  us John or to  dwell in  us or  abide  with us and the Son is said to be  in us  c Rom v and the Holy Ghost is said to be  in  us and in a case which he mentions St Paul tells the  Corinthians  it would be reported that  God  was  in them of a truth  Cor Now can any man assign a tolerable reason why the word  God  in this passage should not be regarded as inclusive of the whole blessed Trinity  Another Scripture saith every one of us shall give account of himself to God  Rom but if in the term  God  Jesus Christ is not comprehended what will become of the text which assures us  we must all appear before  HIS  judgmentseat  Cor The great Apostle of the Gentiles puts the  Elders  of the  Church of Ephesus  in mind that he had  not shunned to declare unto them all the counsel of God  and if he who  purchased  this  Church with his own blood  and he who appointed  overseers over it  are to be considered as parties in this  counsel  and surely they are to be so considered the word God has manifestly a  complex  signification here and  means  more than  one person only  Acts The  Kingdom of God  is a phrase which in most places where it occurs will I presume not barely admit but require the same latitude of application The  Word of God  may be regarded in the same light Lastly I shall close these examples with one which is the more eligible  because it is contained in a text which has already undergone examination and to which our adversaries are for ever putting in their claim I mean v th of the th Chapter of St  Paul  's first Epist to the  Cor  See Disc sub fin  When all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God  i e the complement of the Deity the Trinity in Unity  may be all in all  Every critical eye sees clearly that in this passage for the complex wordGodwe must read the single term Father before we can with any sort of propriety accommodate it to the purpose of the antitrinitarians In this case indeed there would be an obvious sense and a natural antithesis and both in their favour  The other text  I am in the Father and the Father in me  John which Mr J produces as synonomising with the preceding may be explained away by similar means The  Arian  has the following passages to oppose to them  That they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me  c John I am far from saying or even insinuating that there is any real difficulty in all this or that the orthodox construction of  the passages adduced by Mr J does not fairly and properly belong to them I only take leave to observe and have an obvious view in observing that with regard to the defence of Christian doctrine in general and particularly to the confutation of the assertion abovementioned this truly respectable author might have selected texts less equivocal less liable to prevarication  It is observable Dr  I Watts  makes the texts  I am in the  FATHER and  the  FATHER IN ME c subservient to his doctrine of the inherency or  indwelling  of the Father i e of the godhead in the MAN  Christ Jesus  It has been remarked that by a small alteration in the punctuation the d v of the th Chap of St  John that they might know thee the only true God  c may be thus rendered  that they might know thee and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent to be the only true God  This reading is supported by the authorities of  Novatian  St  Austin  and St  Ambrose  But it will be prudent I believe to wave these authorities These Fathers seem to have been  in great fear where no fear was  We may safely abide by the sense of the text before us in its present state Were we really in distress it might be worth our while to appeal to these  early opinions  in our favour  See Discourse    th sub fin  Dr WATTS  's Last Sentiments p    See the

of  heretics  and  fish of antichrist  We find in our nature says a celebrated writer which is said to be made after the image of God a very near resemblance of the Holy Trinity and of the different operations of each of the Divine Persons For example to know a thing present and to remember what is past and to love or hate are different operations of our mind and performed by different faculties of it Of these the understanding is the  Father  faculty and gives being to things as to us for what we know not is to us as if it were not this answers to creation From this faculty proceeds the  second  that of  memory  which is a preserving of that the understanding has created to us Then the  third  faculty that of the will which loves or hates proceeds from both the  other for we cannot love or hate what is not first created by the understanding and preserved to us by the memory  The plastic power of a warm imagination or a sanguine zeal will form emblems and adumbrations of the Trinity in all countries and in all ages of the world We are told the old  Aegyptians  and modern  Americans  worshipped the Deity under the picture of a sun with  three heads  As infidelity will take all advantages of pious whim and indiscreet attachment so will it as surely avail itself to its utmost of certain strange notions which have been advanced in direct variation from the received doctrine of the primitive Church It is not easy to say with what propriety or in what sense Papists have called the  Virgin  the  complement  of the Trinity Mr  Sale  tells us some of the Christian  Arabs  associate with a Sect that worshipped the  Virgin  as a God We learn from the same author and others that some of the  Nicene  Council maintained there were two Gods besides God the Father  viz Christ  and the  Virgin  Others have affirmed that the  Spirit  was the  creature  of the  Son  The Bp of  Agen  wrote an expostulatory letter to Father  Gabriel  who had roundly asserted that  Mary

Apostle replies and proceeds to illustrate the doctrine of the  resurrection of the body  through the remaining part of the Chapter and particularly in the verses some time since quoted If this plainly appears from the fairest and most natural  construction of these passages we stand clear of the aforesaid mortifying imputation and may justly return the compliment And in fact we are encouraged to risk our reputation for wisdom on  our  interpretation by that sort of halfconcession which truth seems to have extorted from Mr L himself when he tells us that the words  that which

which was shewn by his entering into the place where his disciples were assembled when the DOORS WERE SHUT c  however its glory were for the time suspended partly for the better convincing them of the truth of his resurrection and partly because they were not then able to bear the splendor of it  But there are many reasons why we should not humour this child of a fruitful imagination When our Lord

divine power and therefore it was by no means necessary he should be invested with a  spiritual  or heavenly body for that purpose The resurrection of  that  body which was crucified which  rose from the dead  and with which Jesus Christ conversed upon earth  forty days  is the proper pledge and earnest of  our  resurrection his  glorious body  strictly so called being probably assumed at his

his disciples and to the  Jews  to rise again and by so doing at once fulfilled his engagements and gave ample security for the general resurrection  From that passage in St  Paul  's  d Epist to the Cor Ch  which speaks of our being  clothed upon with our house which is from heaven  c some have inferred says Dr  Cudworth  that  bodies come not out of graves  but as this matter is cleared by commentators and Dr  S  lays no stress on the place I shall waste no time upon it  JENKINS  's Reason of Christian v    p  c GROT  de Verit l    c  IGNA  to the Smyrn Sect    See  VOSSIUS  's note p

declares that  flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God  That  body which shall be  raised up at the last day  that material substance which when reunited to the soul will constitute the identical person who died and was buried shall be changed shall even be  fashioned like unto the glorious body  of  Christ  previously as it should seem to its appearance before his  judgmentseat  For  we shall all be changed in a moment c at the last trump when the dead shall be raised incorruptible and this mortal shall put on immortality  It has been observed by many that the good fathers from whom passages are extracted on this subject together with St  Paul  before them in his  th Chap of the    st Epis to the Cor  speak only of the  resurrection of the just  but it is at the same time to be noted that with respect to this principle of incorruption the change in the general  resurrection  will undoubtedly be the same both of the  just and the unjust  Weak reasoning like a weapon which falls short of its aim will be returned upon us by our adversary St  Chrysostom  's argument and that of some other fathers and of many modern Divines for the  resurrection of the same body  drawn from the supposed absurdity of  one  body's sinning and  another's  suffering is obviously a futile one and may be rendered serviceable to the interest of the enemy The body undergoes a great variety of changes in the course of life and it might be asked would not every imaginable purpose of  retribution be fully answered by a future state of happiness or misery to soul and body whencesoever  that body  might be supposed to  come Ut justum est  says  Wollebius ut quaedam peccata post hanc vitam puniantur ita est quoque ut quod socium fuit peccatorum sit quoque poenarum  Compend Chris Theol p    Page  ii he once had  How far says Dr  S  they  Athenag  c succeeded is not the point at present they might have shewn that the  resurrection of the flesh  is no where taught in Scripture  But what if this was left to be shewn by Dr  Sykes  What if their design was to prove the  resurrection of the flesh  to be a Scripture doctrine and that upon rational grounds I venture to think this is put out of doubt by what has been submitted to the reader though luckily Dr  S  himself will help us out if we have any how failed in our argumentation upon this subject For in his account of  Tertullian  's  third form  or  rule of faith  in his book  De Praescriptione Haereticorum  the Dr thus expresses himself  Nor is his  third Form  or  Rule  c any  Creed  of any Church but only a summary of the doctrines of the Gospel  This father then intended his  Form  or  Rule  as a summary of Christian doctrine even according to Dr  S  's account of the matter and in  it  as it is quoted by  himself  we have mention in plain terms of the  resurrection of the flesh  The words of  Tertullian  are these that Christ shall come in glory to judge the world  facta utriusque partis resuscitatione cum carnis restitutione  Enquiry p  Page  kk the first time  Notwithstanding the explicitness of these passages  Mahomet  's theory of the  resurrection  is sometimes not a little whimsical according to what we learn from Mr  Sale  of it He acquaints us that this false prophet supposed the whole human body would be corrupted except the  rumpbone  which is first formed the  os coccygis  as he terms it and that this is to be a sort of seed from whence the whole will be renewed at the last day after a rain of forty days  viz  a great dew according to the  Jews  from whom  Mahomet  took this hint which will impregnate the earth and "cause the bodies to sprout like plants" The  Jews  it seems call this bone  Luz Cudworth  appears to have an eye to this particular in his th Chapter p  SALE  's Prelim Disc  p  Page  ll been discussing  The story which  Mahomet  introduces into the second book of the  Koran  of the miracle God was pleased to work for the confirmation of  Abraham  's faith in the article before us is extraordinary indeed and well worth transcribing  God said to Abraham take four birds cut them in pieces and disperse them in four different mountains and then call them and you shall see all  those four birds will immediately come to you  This story is told by  Mahometan  writers still more circumstantially  These four birds they say were a pigeon a cock a crow and a peacock and that when  Abraham  had cut them in pieces he made a perfect anatomy of them and minced them all together Some add that he pounded them in a mortar and reduced them all to one mass which he divided into four parts and carried them to the top of four several mountains and that then holding up their heads which he retained in his hands he called them severally by their names and that each came accordingly for his head and flew away with it  MORGAN  's  Mahom explained Vol p See Mr WHITES'S Note at l p of his learned B Lectures  It is certain  Mahomet  refined much upon the history of  Moses  in general and my author observes that probably this wild story has its foundation in God's command to  Abraham  to offer a sacrifice of a  turtledove  and a  pigeon  among other animals as we read in the  th Chapter of Gen v    et seq  Page  mm in competent authority  The sense of the Apostolical and primitive Church may be collected from the Form of the first  Baptismal Creed  which ran in the following terms I  believe in God the Father Son and Holy Ghost  See CYPRIAN Epist  That  this Creed which implicitly declares the  Three  Persons to be  One  God was simply the Confession used in the earliest times is the opinion of many learned men and particularly of  Episcopius  the most eminent of the  Remonstrants  in  Holland  who as Dr  Waterland  observes was not aware of its destructive consequence to his own Hypothesis  viz  that the divine eternal generation of the Son was not inserted in the Creeds from the beginning  The words of  Episcopius  as quoted by Bp  Bull  are these  Antiquissimum symbolum quodque in prima Baptismi administratione jam inde ab ipsis Apostolorum temporibus usitabatur hoc erat  CREDO IN DEUM PATREM FILIUM ET SPIRITUM SANCTUM  nempe ad

according to  Prateolus  was in his time no less than as Bp  Taylor  informs us in his discourse on the  Liberty of Prophesying  But he takes no small pains at the same time to lessen their number and extenuate their malignity and it must be granted not without success It concerns not me to enter into particulars or to examine the grounds of this learned prelate's moderation The list of heretics including those of a modern date as it is given us by  A Ross  in his  View of all the Religions in the World  is almost as numerous as the abovementioned The very names of the greatest part of them

per linguam prolati  which are Bp  Bull  's words  The  Valentinians  taught that Christ's body was in a manner purely spiritual and passed through the Virgin as through a pipe or conduit  The  Cainites  worshipped  Cain  as the author of much good to mankind as also  Esau Corah Dathan  c c and  Judas  asserting that he foreknew what happiness should accrue to mankind by Christ's death and therefore betrayed him  It was the doctrine of  Apelles  that there was but one chief God to whom was subordinate a fiery  God who appeared to  Moses in the bush  who made the world gave the law and was the God of  Israel  He gave to Christ a body compacted of the starry and elementary substance which appeared in the shape only of man This body when he ascended he left behind him every part thereof returning to their former principles Christ's spirit only being in heaven This heretic lived says  A Ross  about years after Christ in the reign of the Emperor  Commodus  We have already exhibited to the reader many strange Pagan notions relative to the nature c of the Deity but perhaps the most extraordinary the most eccentric of them all has not yet been remembered It is not properly a heresy indeed but it is an error which may fitly occupy this place The heathen mystical theologists often call God    male  and  female  signifying thereby though grossly yet not unemphatically the  creative  power of the Supreme Being Dr  Cudworth  cites a passage from a hymn of  Synesius  whom he calls a  learned  and  pious  Bishop wherein the Almighty is addressed under expressions precisely equivalent      Agreeably hereunto  Varro  quotes from  Soranus  an eminent poet according to our author the verses following  Jupiter omnipotens regum rex ipse Deûmque  Progenitor genitrixque Deûm Deus unus et omnis  Methinks this sentiment becomes the heathen theologist or poet much better than the Christian Divine  Far from meaning to rank a late very eminent writer Dr  I Watts  in the number of notorious heretics or in the least to detract from the excellence of his character I think myself bound in duty to my subject to take notice here of the singularity of his sentiments  His idea of the Divinity of Christ was that  the Godhead the Deity itself personally distinguished as the  FATHER  was united to the man Christ Jesus in consequence of which union or indwelling of the Godhead he became properly God  It seems these were likewise Dr DODDERIDGE'S sentiments  He conceived this union to have subsisted before the Saviour's appearance in the flesh and that  the human soul of Christ existed with the Father from before the foundation of the world  on which ground he maintains the real descent of Christ from heaven to earth c  In these sentiments there is not so much as a reference to the Holy Ghost But we are not to consider them as final We shall find the Dr to have had more enlarged notions respecting the doctrine of the Trinity  In his SOLEMN ADDRESS TO THE GREAT AND EVERBLESSED GOD on a review of what he  had written in the Trinitarian Controversy  he puts the following questions with all that  humble reverence  his own words and that  holy awe  WHICH  becomes a creature in the presence of his God  Hast thou not O Lord God Almighty hast thou not transacted thy divine and important affairs among men by thy Son  Jesus Christ  and by thy holy Spirit And hast thou not ordained that men should transact their highest and most momentous concerns with thee by thy Son and and by thy Spirit Hast thou not by the mouth of thy Son  Jesus  required all that profess his religion to be washed with water in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost Is it not my duty then to enquire who or what are these sacred names  and what they signify  Hast thou not ascribed divine names and titles and characters to thy Son and thy holy Spirit in thy word as well as assumed them to thyself And hast thou not appointed to them such glorious offices as cannot be executed without something of divinity or true Godhead in them And yet art not thou and thou alone the true God How shall a poor weak creature be able to adjust and reconcile these clashing ideas and to understand this mystery Or must I believe and act blindfold  without understanding  Holy Father he proceeds thou knowest how firmly I believe with all my soul whatsoever thou hast plainly written and revealed in thy word I believe Thee to be the only true God the supreme of beings selfsufficient for thine own existence and for all thy infinite affairs and transactions among creatures I believe thy only Son  Jesus Christ  to be allsufficient for the glorious work of mediation between God and man to which thou hast appointed him I believe he is a man in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily I believe he is one with God he is God manifested in the flesh and that the man  Jesus  is so closely and inseparably united with the true and eternal Godhead as to become one person even as the soul and body make one man  I believe also thy blessed Spirit hath almighty power and influence to do all thy will to instruct men effectually in divine truths c I yield up myself joyfully and thankfully to this method of thy salvation as it is revealed in thy gospel But I acknowlege my darkness still I want to have this wonderful doctrine of the allsufficience of thy Son and Spirit for these divine works made a little plainer  Hadst thou informed me gracious Father in any place of thy word that this divine doctrine is not to be understood by men and yet they  were required to believe it I would have subdued all my curiosity to faith c But I cannot find thou hast any where forbid me to understand it or to make these enquiries My conscience is the best natural light thou hast put within me and since thou hast given me the Scriptures my own conscience bids me search the Scriptures to find out truth c I have therefore been long searching into this divine doctrine that I may pay thee due honour with understanding Surely I ought to know the God whom I worship whether he be one pure and simple being or whether thou art a threefold deity consisting of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit  Dear and blessed God hadst thou been pleased in any one plain Scripture to have informed me which of the different opinions about the Holy Trinity among the contending parties of Christians had been true thou knowest with how much zeal satisfaction and joy my unbiassed heart would have opened itself to receive and embrace the discovery Hadst thou told me plainly in any single text that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are three real distinct persons in thy divine nature I had never suffered myself to be bewildered in so many doubts nor embarrassed with so many strong fears of assenting to the mere inventions of men instead of divine  doctrine but I should have humbly and immediately accepted thy words so far as it was possible for me to understand them as the only rule of my faith Or hadst thou been pleased so to express and include this proposition in the several scattered parts of thy book from whence my reason and conscience might with ease find out and with certainty infer this doctrine I should have joyfully employed all my reasoning powers with their utmost skill and activity to have found out this inference  and ingrafted it into my soul  Thou hast called the poor and the ignorant the mean and foolish things of this world to the knowlege of thyself and thy Son and taught them to receive and partake of the Salvation which thou hast provided But how can such weak creatures ever take in so strange so difficult and so abstruse a doctrine as this in the explication and defence whereof multitudes of men even men of learning and piety have lost themselves in infinite subtilties of dispute and endless mazes of darkness And can this strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God be so necessary and so important a part of that Christian doctrine which in the old Testament and the new is represented as so plain and so easy even to the meanest understandings  O thou searcher of hearts who knowest all  things I appeal to thee concerning the sincerity of my enquiries into these discoveries of thy word  I humbly call thee to witness O my God what a holy jealousy I ever wear about my heart lest I should do the slightest dishonour to thy supreme Majesty in any of my enquiries or determinations Thou seest what a religious fear and what a tender solicitude I maintain on my soul lest I should think or speak any thing to diminish the grandeurs and honours of thy Son  Jesus  my dear Mediator c Thou knowest how much I am afraid of speaking one word which may be construed into a neglect of thy blessed Spirit from whom I hope I am daily receiving happy influences of light and strength Guard all the motions of my mind O Almighty God against every thing that borders upon these dangers Forbid my thoughts to indulge and forbid my pen to write one word that should sink those grand ideas which belong to thyself or thy Son or thy Holy Spirit Forbid it O my God that ever I should be so unhappy as to unglorify my Father my Saviour or my Sanctifier in any of my sentiments or expressions concerning them  Blessed and faithful God hast thou not promised that the meek thou wilt guide in judgment the meek thou wilt teach thy way Hath not  thy Son our Saviour assured us that our heavenly Father will give his holy Spirit to them who ask him And is he not appointed to guide us into all truth Have I not sought the gracious guidance of thy good Spirit continually Am I not truly sensible of my own darkness and weakness my dangerous prejudices on every side and my utter insufficiency for my own conduct Wilt thou leave such a poor creature bewildered among a thousand perplexities which are raised by the various opinions and contrivances of men to explain thy divine truth  Help me heavenly Father for I am quite tired and weary of these human explainings so various and uncertain When wilt thou explain it to me thyself O my God by the secret and certain dictates of thy Spirit according to the intimations of thy word  Now for truth's sake I desire to ask any intelligent impartial and candid reader whether we have not in these passages strong indications of a wavering though pious mind Whether such language as this does not rather tend to encourage specious scepticism than sound faith Whether it is not chargeable with inconsistency between reverence and remonstrance between declarations of acquiescence and expostulations of discontent Whether according to Dr  W  's ideas all ecclesiastical authority is not as such altogether odious or contemptible  and whether for what appears to the contrary from these periods Christianity might not flourish without the existence of Church pastor or teacher Whether we have not in this illustrious Dissenter an extraordinary instance of the compatibility of radical and invincible prejudice with an  honest and good heart  and a solid understanding Whether Dr  W  had any thing like sufficient grounds for his suspicion that the orthodox received doctrines are resolvible into mere  explainings inventions or contrivances of men  Whether he does not appear to be unreasonably though sincerely anxious to  understand all mysteries  while at the same time he could not but know that the capital doctrines of the Gospel are delivered AS mysterious and that Christians are supposed and required to  walk by faith and not by sight  Whether he does not most erroneously convert a  particular  promise into a  general  one not recollecting that though for obvious and very important purposes our  heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him  yet that Spirit was by no means  appointed  to  guide  every individual Christian into  all  spiritual  truth  Whether had we been told "plainly" in so many words  in any single text that the Father Son and holy Spirit are three real and distinct persons in the divine nature  it had been possible for D  W  to have misunderstood it or whether he or any body else could have  been "bewildered in any doubts" with respect to this doctrine Whether such a "discovery" of it would not have been received every where with "unbiassed hearts" and with universal  zeal safaction and joy  a few instances perhaps of obduracy c excepted Whether had it been  so expressed and included in the several scattered parts  of Scripture that the Doctor's  reason and conscience could with ease have found it out and with certainty inferred it  there would have been the least occasion for the "skill and activity of his rational powers" Whether after all the doctrine in question be not expressed or included in the sacred pages sufficiently to warrant any man's firm assent to it especially when we take into the account the whole weight of that evidence by which we prove its correspondency with the sense of antiquity and the belief of the primitive Church Whether the wisest and the weakest are not equally incapable of "taking in so difficult and so abstruse a doctrine" as that of the Trinity Whether the Christian doctrine concerning things spiritual and mysterious is really "represented" either in the Old Testament or the New as  plain and easy even to the meanest understanding  Whether granting that  multitudes even of men of learning and piety have lost themselves in infinite subtilties of dispute c in the explication and defence  of the doctrine before us all  this should not be principally attributed to antitrinitarian artifice and to a gradual departure from that simplicity in which it was originally taught and received in the world Whether if this  perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true God  be a part of Christian doctrine it is not  prima facie  the most "necessary and the most important" Finally whether the doctrine of the Trinity as held in the Church has not at least as much countenance from Scripture and even from reason as Dr  W  's notion of the  indwelling of the Deity in the Man Christ Jesus  and whether this is not in effect acknowleged by himself  As to the notion itself it is I trust to all intents and purposes refuted in the foregoing pages and I shall content myself with expressing my astonishment at the force of prejudice in one who so strongly recommends or more properly inculcates an "indifference for every thing but truth"  See Improvement of the Mind p  and censures so severely all domestic national or party attachments For with all his gentleness benevolence charity and love of truth Dr  W  appears to me to have been biassed by more than ordinary prepossessions He who has expressed himself in the manner we have seen he who has occasionally declared that he  allowed the greatest distinction possible between the sacred three in the divine nature which does not arise to three distinct conscious  minds or spirits" and that he was fully "established in the belief of the  Deity of the blessed Three  though he knew not the  manner of explication  must to my apprehension be considered as protesting against the doctrine of a Trinity of  Persons  chiefly because it was an established one because it was the doctrine of the Church  I have dwelt the longer on this case as it is uncommon as it is the case of a great and good man whom to borrow Dr  Johnson  's words  every Christian Church would rejoice to have adopted  Dr  WATT  's last Sentiments on the Trinity p    Solemn Address p    c See  JOHNSON  's Life of Dr  WATTS  with notes c  CUDWORTH  's Intell Syst Ch    p  A ROSS  's View of all Religions Sect    P  oo to judge for ourselves  It abundantly appears by a considerable number of extracts made by Bp  Jewel  from many fathers and doctors of the Church of  Rome  that antiently in that communion the Holy Scriptures were not barely indulged but recommended to every hand By what means the  Romanists  have since qualified the sense of these passages or reconciled the same with principles of a later date I have no occasion to inquire But in one of them there is a singularity which I believe will pay any man for his trouble in the reading It is to be found in  Theodoret  and is translated by the  great prelate as follows  Ye may commonly see that our doctrine is known not only of them that are the doctors of the Church and the masters of the people but also even of the  tailors  and  smiths  and  weavers  and of all artificers yea and farther also of  women  and that not only of them that be learned but also of  labouring women  and  sempsters  and  servants  and  handmaids  Neither only the  citizens  but also the  countryfolks  do very well understand the same Ye may find yea even the very  ditchers  and  delvers  and  cowherds  and  gardiners  disputing of the HOLYTRINITY and of the CREATION OF ALL THINGS  The same passage is referred to by Dr POTTER in his Answer to  Charity Mistaken p    JEWEL  's Defence c part    p    Page  pp mistaken in that judgment  An eminent and learned writer of the last century whom I have quoted before observes and the observation has been also cited that  heresy is not an error of the understanding but of the will  and to this doctrine properly stated we can readily subscribe But in the excess of his moderation this Right Rev author sometimes questions in effect at least the authority not only of all ecclesiastical traditions and councils but of the Scripture itself giving us sentiments wholly incongruous with every idea of faith system or establishment  Witness  those  contained in the following extract which to my imagination nothing but the zeal of adherency to a favourite principle could have drawn from the pen of so able a writer and so professed a casuist  Since says he holy Scripture is the repository of divine truths and the great rule of faith to which all sects of Christians do appeal for probation of their several opinions and since all agree in the articles of the Creed as things clearly and plainly set down and as containing all that which is of simple and prime necessity and since on the other side there are in Scripture many other mysteries and matters of question upon which there is a vail since there are so many copies with infinite varieties of reading since a various interpunction a parenthesis a letter an accent may much alter the sense since some places have divers literal senses many have spiritual mystical and allegorical meanings since there are so many tropes metonymies ironies hyperboles proprieties and improprieties of language whose understanding depends upon such circumstances that it is almost impossible to know its proper interpretation now that the knowlege of such circumstances and particular stories is irrecoverably lost since there are some mysteries which at the best advantage of expression are not easy to be apprehended and whose explication  by reason of our imperfections must needs be dark sometimes weak sometimes unintelligible and lastly since those ordinary means of expounding Scripture as searching the originals conference of places parity of reason and analogy of faith are all dubious uncertain and very fallible he that is the wisest and by consequence the likeliest to expound truest in all probability of reason will be very far from confidence because every one of these and many more are like so many degrees of improbability and incertainty all depressing our certainty of finding out truth in such mysteries and amidst so many difficulties And therefore a wise man that considers this would not willingly be prescribed to by others and therefore if he also be a just man he will not impose upon others for it is best every man should be left in that liberty from which no man can justly take him unless he could secure him from error So that here also there is a necessity to conserve the liberty of prophesying and interpreting Scripture a necessity derived from the consideration of the difficulty of Scripture in questions controverted and the uncertainty of any internal medium of interpretation  Now if this be the case we are but mocked when we are told the Scriptures are the "repository of divine truths" or that  any  articles of faith  can be "clearly and plainly set down" in any Creed whatsoever Under the above circumstances in what formulary or system shall we look for  all that which is of simple and prime necessity  Is it not strange too that there should be  many other mysteries  in Scripture distinct from those  divine truths  of which it is the repository and stranger still that matters of  question  should be put under a  vail  Upon all matters of  faith  there is indeed a vail I mean upon all mysterious matters which cannot possibly be "apprehended at the best advantage of expression" The explication of  these  is absolutely impracticable and every attempt for that purpose  by reason of our imperfections must needs be dark sometimes weak sometimes unintelligible  Perhaps he will bid as fair as any man to be an expounder of mysteries who shall disentangle the several clauses of this paragraph I know not whether any thing can be found surpassing this either in the style or in the spirit of present moderation  See a curious vindication of this author Bp TAYLOR in WOOD'S Ath Oxoni p Vol  The truth of the matter is that very sensible and very good men are apt to run into inconsistencies upon this subject  It is very meet says Dr  Potter  in his answer to  Char Mistaken  that the ignorant people should  obey their overseers in the Lord  and submit themselves to the ministry and direction of the Church  in many  profound doctrines  above their reach But it behoves them says he in the immediately following sentence to have a distinct and comfortable knowlege of the  essential points of faith  and not securely to rest in a babish simplicity but so far as God hath enabled them to be led on to perfection To which purpose they are commanded to  search the Scriptures  that they may  grow and increase in knowlege  c and that they may be able both to  believe with the heart and confess with their mouth  and render a  reason  of that  hope  that is in them  Bp  TAYLOR  's Disc on the Lib of Pro Sect    No    Char Mistaken answered Sect    p    Page  qq freedom of sentiment  The humour of raising doubts and disputes opposing establishments and disdaining to think or act in the common way is as Bp  Gibson  observes well expressed by one of the advocates for infidelity in words to the following effect that  if the opinions of a certain friend of his were established to day he would oppose them to morrow  This the Bp informs us is reported to have been said by a person I suppose of some consequence whose name he mentions not  Bp  GIBSON  's Past Let p    Page  rr spiritual Constitution  The author of a work published some years since under  the title of  Free Thoughts on the subject of a farther Reformation  speaks of our Reformers in the following terms  One no small disadvantage which they unhappily laboured under and which from their time to this has been matter of just regret to true friends of  Divine Revelation  was their  defect  of knowlege in sacred matters above all in the  true sense of Scripture  c If says he in another place we would form our judgments of the abilities of our Reformers to frame for us a system of doctrines which should remain a perpetual standard of belief and profession in the  English  Church and by which all our Clergy in all future ages should be summarily concluded we shall I suppose see just reason to wish that they had been more equal than they appear to be to so weighty an undertaking Those who are well acquainted with their writings will see in a variety of instances evident marks of their insufficiency for such a task and be fully convinced of the truth of that observation of a learned and worthy Doctor of our Church that they were but  bad interpreters  of the Scriptures  In support of all this derogation which is obligingly qualified with a few introductory commonplace compliments our author has given us a number of extracts relative to certain religious topics from ArchBishop  Cranmer  's Catechism published in and dedicated to King  Edward  VI  We may see it seems from these extracts how greatly disproportioned the abilities of this famous Prelate and his colleagues were to the work of Reformation c To what conclusions this will lead I need not inform the reader But I take leave to offer a remark or two upon the occasion In the first place if the intellectual weakness of our Reformers was really so great as is here represented Protestants to a man have reason enough to be ashamed of themselves What answer shall they make to any sensible  RomanCatholic  who should teaze them with these mortifying truths To my thinking as none of the exceptionable contents of the passages cited from the ArchBishop's Catechism make a part of the doctrine of our Church they might in reverence to  his  memory and for  her  credit have much better been suppressed Had this Gentleman contented himself with observing that the Reformers of the Church were fallible men and consequently that the Forms and Offices they have delivered down to us may be capable in some instances of alteration and improvement he had spoken more agreeably to truth though less adequately to his purpose For what he has alledged has a plain tendency to shew the necessity rather of  pulling down  than  repairing  our spiritual  building  On the whole as he has conducted matters I know not any one person upon earth under so many obligations to him as the Pope of  Rome  I shall take this opportunity to animadvert on certain dirty aspersions in a late performance from the hand of a rigid nonconformist and perhaps an avowed unbeliever and perhaps both  The anonymous editor of Dr  Johnson  's Life of Dr  I Watts  with Notes sacrifices to the virulence of his diposition every regard to decency charity and truth It will be proper to trace this calumny to it's source  Happy says the celebrated Biographer will be that reader viz of the works of Dr  W  whose mind is disposed by his verses or his prose to imitate him in all but his Nonconformity to copy his benevolence to man and his reverence to God  Is there any thing in this to put a man of candour or a man of sense out of humour Yet our Editor asks  is not this exception and even the mention of this circumstance a striking proof of Dr  Johnson  's bigotted attachment to the national established mode of worship  It is really no proof at all How far Dr  J  was in fact a bigot to establishments I undertake not to determine but the period just quoted by no means proves him to have been so The most moderate Churchman breathing has not the better opinion of Dr  W  for his Nonconformity I cannot think such an one could have "mentioned this circumstance" more tenderly had he mentioned it at all and with what propriety Dr  W  's Biographer could have left it unmentioned I must  leave it to this Gentleman to explain to us  Reverence to God he proceeds and benevolence to man are the two grand essentials of religion He that possesses these is a true Christian whatever be the external mode of worship which he adopts Neither his Conformity nor his Nonconformity will exclude him from the divine favour nor ought it to be matter of censure to his fellowcreatures If a man in uniting with any Christian community appears to follow the dictates of his own conscience c he deserves the esteem of all parties and to object to his peculiarity of religious profession is the mark of a little mind  Now this is partly true partly false but you see as far as Dr  Johnson  is concerned wholly impertinent There is as little as possible of censure or of objection in the sentence above quoted from him As to sincerity of persuasion no body denies the validity of it's pretensions but at the same time what will make an honest man will by no means constitute a "true Christian"  Reverence to God and benevolence to man are indeed the two grand essentials of all religion  and to borrow our author's term they MAY be  possest  by Jews Turks Infidels and Heretics  "That Dr  W  was conscientious in his Nonconformity" will be readily admitted but surely this will not justify the unfairness or the duplicity  or the malignity or the falshood of the following paragraph  Considering what the terms of ministerial conformity are says our annotator it may be justly questioned whether if all the clergy were equally conscientious one half of them would not be Dissenters To declare an  assent and consent  to ALL and EVERY THING  contained in the Thirtynine Articles the book of Common Prayer  c which comprehend such a prodigious number of particulars many of them very disputable some of them unintelligible and others exploded by the wisest and best of men is such a requisition as it is hard to be conceived the generality of the clergy can  bona fide  approve It is indeed WELL KNOWN that MOST of them and even of the BISHOPS themselves disbelieve some of the doctrinal articles of the Church as appears from the general strain of their preaching and of their writings and that they profess to subscribe them only as articles of peace If the terms of conformity were a declaration that they  did not believe  "all and every thing c" it is undeniable that many not to say the most of those that conform might very conscientiously make it Whether therefore their subscription to the present terms be consistent with simplicity and godly sincerity it behoves them seriously to enquire If others think that such a subscription would in them be a gross prevarication and rather than  be chargeable with it willingly forego the advantages of being in the Church they ought at least to be respected as honest men And if Dr  Johnson  had studied the grounds of Nonconformity which he appears not to have done he might have entertained a better opinion of the understandings of Protestant Dissenters as well as their integrity But this is not the place for entering into that controversy  If these representations are just and these assertions true the controversy is absolutely decided with a vengeance and the bulk of the clergy of of the Church of  England  are as great a set of scndrls as can be produced in the annals of the human race I shall not waste a moment in vindicating them from imputations so palpably scandalous but content myself with declaring my firm belief that Dr  Johnson  would not  have entertained a better opinion either of the understandings or integrity of Protestant Dissenters  from these samples of BOTH and that were Dr  W  restored to life he would for visible reasons think himself under much greater obligations to the Biographer than to the Annotator  In short we are not to wonder at any thing which is advanced by one who maintains as this writer does in another page of this very performance that  in the Scriptureplan no traces of a national Church or ecclesiastical authority are to be found  It may be pertinent to remark farther that  exceedingly mad  as the Puritans and their friends in the last century were  against  the governors of the Church and our whole ecclesiastical polity THEY appear to have been more than ordinarily solicitous to express their full  assent  and  consent  to the most material articles of our faith Their  quarrel  was not  against  our doctrine but our discipline I have by me a just and literal translation of the  Confession of Faith  together with two  Catechisms  a larger and a less drawn up by the  Assembly of Divines at Westminster  in under the authority and with the concurrence and approbation of Parliament so called and of the Kirk of  Scotland  The d clause in the ch  de Deo et Sacrosancta Trinitate  runs  verbatim  as follows  In Deitatis unitate personae tres sunt unius ejusdemque essentiae potentiae ac aeternitatis Deus Pater Deus Filius ac Deus Spiritus Sanctus Pater quidem a nullo est nec genitus nempe nec procedens Filius autem a Patre est aeterne genitus Spiritus autem Sanctus aeterne procedens a Patre Filioque  In the d ch  de statu hominum post mortem deque resurrectione mortuorum  we find this clause  Novissimo illo die qui comperientur in vivis non morientur quidem sed mutabuntur qui mortui fuerint resuscitabuntur omnes ipsissimis iis corporibus quibus viventes aliquando fungebantur ac non aliis ut  ut qualitate differentibus quae denuo animabus quaeque suis aeterno conjugio unientur  These doctrines are held out almost in the same words in both  Catechisms  From which circumstances I take occasion to ask whether as far as we may reasonably collect from the style and the sentiments of the Editor of Dr  Johnson  's Life of Dr  I Watts  with Notes the views and the dispositions of the Protestant Dissenters of this age have not a tendency more inimical and destructive than were those of these same Ancestors of theirs who "triumphed in the ruin" both of Church and State  But is there not after all an inveterate difficulty which we have rather met than encountered and much less overcome and which furnishes Popery with its shrewdest argument and Infidelity with its strongest handle The protestant principle asserts the right of private judgment in matters of religion And yet precepts relative to obedience to spiritual authority c are as plain as those directions which require us to  prove all things and to hold fast that which is good  c How shall we reconcile these things In consequence of the exertion of this personal right differences arise in the world and controversies the natural issue of them How are these to be decided Is it not a solecism in religion to suppose a controversy without a judge Nevertheless we say and demonstrate  too that the Church of  Rome  the only Church which pretends to infallibility has erred and that even in fundamentals Accordingly we refer to no arbitration we acknowlege no rule of faith no judge of controversy but Holy Scripture  Supremus judex  say the  Westminster  Divines abovementioned  a quo omnes de religione controversiae sunt determinandae omnia conciliorum decreta opiniones c nullus alius esse potest praeter Spiritum Sanctum in Scriptura pronunciantem  Confess Fid Cap  But are not these  vain words  Doth any man or any body of men pretend to the  gift of discerning of Spirits  at this day Or if they do are their pretensions admissible Or can Scripture with any propriety be said to be the judge of controversy when it is the whole and sole ground of it Do not all parties find means to wrench the authority of the sacred pages to their side Every  Antitrinitarian  will say in the words of  Chillingworth  whatever the real sentiments of the latter might be  Propose me any thing out of this Book and require whether I believe or no and seem it never so incomprehensible to human reason I will subscribe it with hand and heart as knowing no Demonstration can be stronger than this God hath said so therefore it is true  Religion of Protestants c p  But then to the proofs you have to offer and the texts  you have to produce he opposes his texts and his proofs such as they are or perhaps one general assertion which no body can deny  viz  that there is but "one living and true God" Where now is the judge of controversy What is become of ecclesiastical authority Or what have we to say to those who  cast  it  in our teeth  that the Church of  England  hath erred as well as the Church of  Rome  In short where is heresy And what is schism  With a view to the solution of this difficulty and by way of Supplement to the contents of the foregoing sheets let us see whether a little enquiry will not enable us sufficiently to ascertain what heresy of the worst sort was in the days of the Apostles themselves and according to the conception they must by fair construction be understood to have entertained of it  In his d general Epistle St  Peter  foretells that there would be  false teachers  among Christians  who  should  privily bring in damnable heresies  EVEN  denying the Lord that bought them  ch v From which passage we can do no less than infer that the denial of the  Lord that bought  us is of all  heresies  the most  damnable  Now whether we do or do not abide by Dr  Whitby  's interpretation who apprehends we are to understand God the Father by the word  Lord  in this passage  Christ being never styled  the original word in the New Testament  the inference  will inevitably be one and the same  Jesus Christ  was confessedly the purchaser of the  Church with his own blood  In point of nature or attribute there can therefore be no difference betwixt these two Persons the heresy which denies either will be equally damnable according to Dr  W  's sentiment But if we reject it the Divinity of our Saviour is not less implied in the text before us For in most evident allusion to this very purchase  Ye are bought with a price  says St  Paul  to the  Corinthians therefore  continues he  glorify God  i e out of all question  Jesus Christ  who  bought  you  in your body and in your Spirit  which are God's i e which are Christ's Cor It may be a satisfaction to the reader to compare this passage with the following in the next Chapter  He that is called being free is Christ's servant Ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men  v c  In his last and farewell address to the  Children of Israel  which is called his  Song  their great Legislator puts this question to them  is not he thy father that hath bought thee  Deutero Ch  God is said to have  bought  his people by his deliverance of them from the  bondage of Aegypt  which was only a type but indisputably a type of the  eternal redemption obtained for us  by the precious blood of  Christ  And is it  not just to infer the equality of these Divine purchasers from the nature and value of their respective purchases The denial of the  Lord that bought  us is therefore in effect the denial of the Divinity of our Saviour  There is a passage in St  Jude  parallel to this which we have had in consideration that will not be found consistent with it or with its context without supposing the same equality This Apostle complains of certain  ungodly men  who  denied the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ  They  denied our Lord Jesus Christ  as one with the Father not as in essence distinct from him I say the affinity of this passage to the other and its own context not barely warrant but demand this sense  Jude the Servant of Jesus Christ c to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved  BY  Jesus Christ and called  We are very sufficiently authorised to read  by  for  in  See Hammond c c  in this passage and if so it is most undoubtedly as much the attribute or property of the Supreme God to  preserve  and to  call  as it is to  sanctify  which indeed is the discriminative office of the Holy Ghost whose Divinity by the way is here plainly asserted by implication But we are under no necessity of disturbing the present version In the d verse the Apostle exhorts Christians to  contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints  That from the beginning some should  depart from the  faith or  a belief in  Jesus Christ  as the  Son of God  by eternal generation on principles and for reasons by which infidels and sceptics are influenced at this day is by no means matter of astonishment But supposing the faith of the primitive Christians the  faith which was once delivered unto the Saints  to have been merely a faith in  Jesus Christ  as a  prophet  or as the  Messiah  or as a  creature  of a more or less  excellent name  there would I presume have been little room for  contention  about it or danger of its being  denied  If we take into examination that impious and strange doctrine of which St  John  speaks in terms of strong censure and resentment in his  first  and  second general Epistle  this research will likewise terminate in an unquestionable proof of our Lord's Divinity and convince us that in the denial of it the error consisted  Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard c Many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh This is a deceiver and an antichrist  John v John v Or as some read these passages  that confess not Jesus Christ which is come in the flesh  The import of these texts will not be in the least affected by this variation That the  man Christ Jesus  the person who was known by the name of  Jesus Christ  lived and conversed in the world did  many wonderful  works  was contumeliously treated and at length put to a painful and ignominious death were facts too recent and too generally known to be disputed by any at the time when our Apostle wrote these Epistles That the  Jesus Christ  of these Epistles was the very identical person whom the Apostle styles in his Gospel the  Son of God  the  Word  that  was in the beginning with God  and really and truly  was God  cannot with the least appearance of reason be questioned But that  God  was indeed  manifest in the flesh  took our nature upon him and  bare our sins in his own body on the tree  this was a  saying  too  hard  for the acceptation of those  deceivers false prophets  and  antichrists  as St  John  calls them and whom at the th v of Chap he represents as possest with the  spirit of error  Accordingly they were weak and at the same time bold enough to resolve this great truth into mere semblance and deception and to affirm that the human person of  Jesus Christ  was a phantom and lived and suffered and died not really but in appearance only which abominably ridiculous notion was as has been observed in a great measure adopted afterwards by  Mahomet  who was offended at those indignities and sufferings which he considered as altogether unworthy of that prophetic character which he acknowleged  Jesus Christ  as his predecessor to have been vested with This doctrine is delivered in the  Koran  in general terms but the  followers of  Mahomet  differ in their sentiments respecting it According to some  Jesus Christ  was not nailed to the Cross but a malefactor who in person much resembled him The person crucified say others was  a spy that was sent to intrap our Saviour  and others assert him to have been  Judas  and others  Simon the Cyrenian  Or if we suppose St  John  to have had in his eye another heretical tenet of a similar nature and tendency which was very early disseminated in the Church  viz  that of the  Carpocratians  c who made a distinction betwixt  Jesus  and  Christ  and maintained that the former suffered and rose again but that the latter was impassible as being purely of a spiritual nature agreeably to the idea suggested by  Webster  's translation of Father  Simon  which for  every Spirit which confesseth not  c reads which  separateth Jesus  the result will necessarily be found to be one and the same For to what can we reasonably attribute the denial of our Lord's humanity or its separation from the divinity but to an averseness to acknowlege the union of God and Man in the person of  Jesus Christ  And if so it will naturally follow that this union was the doctrine of the  Apostles  and the belief of the primitive Church  It is well worth observing that  Polycarp  in his Epistle to the  Philippians  quotes word for word the d v of the th Ch of St  John  's first Epistle  Whosoever does not confess  c and that  Ignatius  who conversed with the Apostles and upon the death of  Evodius  was appointed Bishop of  Antioch  by as many of the sacred College as were then living not barely mentions but most expressly censures and condemns this whimsical opinion of the  Phantomists  if I may take liberty so to call them  Stop your ears says he in his Epistle to the  Trallians  as often as any one shall speak contrary to  Jesus Christ  who was of the race of  David  c who was truly born and did eat and drink was truly persecuted under  Pontius Pilate  was truly crucified and dead  And a little after if says he  some who are Atheists that is to say Infidels pretend that he only SEEMED to suffer they themselves only seeming to exist why then am I bound Why do I desire to fight with beasts  In the Epistle of the same Father to the  Smyrnaeans  we have the following passage  And he suffered truly as he also truly raised up himself and not as some unbelievers say that he only SEEMED to suffer  Though therefore neither the Apostles nor the Apostolical Fathers particularly specify what heresy is it appears by just and natural inference from many passages in their writings originally to have consisted in denying the perfect Godhead and perfect manhood of our Saviour and that heresies in general deserve to be considered as so many evasions  of these fundamental truths There is another passage in the Epistle to the  Trallians  which simply asserting the Divinity of  Jesus Christ  puts this out of all reasonable doubt  I exhort you says the venerable Author or rather not I but the love of  Jesus Christ  that you use none but Christian nourishment abstaining from pasture which is of another kind I mean heresy  For  See the references in the Margin  they that are heretics confound together the doctrine of Jesus Christ  with their own poison c Wherefore guard yourselves against such persons And that you will do if you are not puffed up but continue inseparable from  Jesus Christ  our GOD and from your Bishop and from the commands of the Apostles  In short all these circumstances concur to the establishment of our first Hypothesis If the Catholic faith of the primitive Christians was the same which is held in the Church of  England  at this day at and before the publication of the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament as well as the writings of the Apostolical Fathers their doctrine on the subjects we have been handling is sufficiently uniform and explicit if otherwise it is by far too consistent and too perspicuous  Agreeably to what has been advanced we may farther observe the sacred authors frequently referring to some standing doctrines some capital articles  of belief which had been by them taught and were by the Church universally received It will be a hard matter to comprehend the meaning of many passages in the Scriptures without supposing them to import or to allude to some such doctrines or principles The first converts to Christianity are said to have  continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship  Acts ii  and whatsoever that doctrine might be it was then no WRITTEN doctrine St  Paul  thanks God that the  Roman  converts had  obeyed from the heart that  FORM OF DOCTRINE  which was delivered to them  Rom vi  He exhorts the  Thessalonians to stand fast and hold the  TRADITIONS which  they had been taught whether by word or by  his  Epistle  Thess ii  and recommends it to  Timothy  to  keep that which was committed to his trust  and to  hold fast the  FORM  of sound words which he had heard of  him  Tim i  He injoins  Titus  to  reject a man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition  Titus iii  It will be sufficient to add to this the advice of St  Jude  to Christians in general which just above fell under notice  viz  that they should  earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints  It was doubtless with an eye to this  faith  to the preservation of the same in purity and to the future peace and prosperity of the Church that  Jesus  Christ gave some Apostles  as St  Paul  informs us  and some Evangelists and some Prophets and some Pastors and Teachers  Ephes iv  nor could the purpose of such appointments have been answered but by a regular succession of some of these characters through all ages  For the same purpose most unquestionably  God hath set in the Church helps and governments  c as the same Apostle declares to his  Corinthian  converts in the th Chapter of his first Epistle to them  Now how all this could be done or how either  Evangelist Prophet  or  Teacher  or Governor could at  any  time or in  any  manner exercise his function without invading the right of private judgment as it has of late days been contended for or without departing from the  simplicity  of the Gospel in its original state I pretend not to have sufficient penetration to discover  Matters appear then to stand thusThat  Jesus Christ  constituted no arbitrator no infallible judge or decider of controversy c in his Church is demonstrable from the differences the disputes and dissentions relative to  circumcision  c which subsisted in its very infancy At the same time it is certain the Holy Scriptures speak of a  common faith and of the common salvation  Titus i Jude v  You have seen  what grounds we have for our persuasion that such  common faith  was nothing more or less than a belief in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity and the other articles contained in our Creeds Under this persuasion the Church of England as a national Church as a Church reformed from the gross errors corruptions and superstitions of  Rome  has not only "power to decree rites or ceremonies but authority in controversies of faith"  viz  authority not to determine but to declare Accordingly we do not anathematise or molest them that renounce our Doctrine or separate from our Discipline upon principles avowed by ourselves We maintain our own rights without encroaching upon the privileges of others We "discover condemn and avoid" what we call and believe to be heresies without aiming or wishing to prevent them by coercion We conceive spiritual government to be as compatible with religious liberty as temporal jurisdiction is with civil and that when the Reformers asserted the right of private judgment in matters of religion the natural right of all men to make use of their own faculties  they could not possibly mean to invest every individual with the privilege of working out his own salvation by his own understanding and endeavours  independently on any extraneous assistance or instruction whatever and much less to intimate that he  is under an indispensable obligation so to do Were this the case the Apostle's question  are all Teachers  must be answered in the affirmative and the necessary consequence would be that EVERY BODY and yet NO BODY would be a  Teacher  Which is absurd Neither the justest claim nor the most reasonable exemption can alter the nature of things If it be true that this Church derives her existence from the exertions of human reason emancipating itself from spiritual slavery it is as true that she owes her preservation to decent order and legal establishment If it be true that the bulk of the people naturally wish to act to think and to judge for themselves it is as true that they naturally take advice or instruction from others submit to controul and reverence authority In short to whatever causes we are to ascribe that diversity of opinion which distracts the world how perplexing so ever the present constitution of things may be or for whatever reasons it has pleased infinite wisdom to place us in a state of trial infirmity and imperfection one general truth must universally be subscribed to  viz  that with respect both to faith and practice  the Lord knoweth them that are his  Tim ii  and will hereafter acknowlege them accordingly  P S It is needless to tell the sensible reader that I have not been professedly contending with any of the latitudinarian writers whose works are incidentally quoted or referred to in the
