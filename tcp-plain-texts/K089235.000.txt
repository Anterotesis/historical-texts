 THE LIFE OF JOHN WILKES  Esq  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE LIFE OF JOHN WILKES  Esq  In the Manner of PLUTARCH BEING A SPECIMEN of a larger Work  THE SECOND EDITION Revised and Corrected  LONDON Printed for J WILKIE at No in St Paul's Churchyard  MDCCLXXIII  THE LIFE OF JOHN WILKES  Esq  MOST ages have produced some shining models of undaunted virtue and unabating patriotismIt is the part of the Biographer to select characters from the mass of mankind and to hold those only up to view who have been most distinguished on the vast theatre of human  life Were men to be promiscuously described little advantage would be derived from reviewing the annals of past or present times and the eye after a glance would turn away with weariness as from an unbounded plain or a mirror where all objects were presented indiscriminatelyBut if others have laboured under the disadvantage of describing characters equally mixed with right and wrong the Author here has little reason to complain of such blended materialsHe gives one bold enterprizing and the same ever possessing uniform principles  without deviation and without ambiguity  A man says  Plutarch  to be completely great must be born in some famous city  London  boasts the birth of Mr  Wilkes  His mother it is reported was delivered without pain or labour and a spectre appeared to the nurse which foretold that the child she then suckled should prove the ornament and support of the  British  Empire circumstances which to many would have appeared trifling and enthusiastic had not his future conduct  evinced the truth of the prediction  Of his Family nothing is reported but in extreams for whilst some would have him to be the son of a distiller and bred up to the cask others trace him up to a most illustrious origin but when some of his friends judged that he should change his name before he engaged in state affairs he prettily enough replied that he would make the name of  Wilkes  more glorious than that of a  Catiline  or a  Cade  and when having served the high  and important office of Sheriff of  London  and the citizens were desirous of making an oblation of silver plate to him so far from renouncing his origin that he desired his figure with a dagger in his hand to destroy a monarch should be engraved on the side of a large Drinking Cup  Now he being as  Plato  says a scholar ought to be disposed to all manner of learning and neglectful of no arts cultivated besides his other studies an early taste for poetry and with such  wonderful success that in  In this poem entitled the  Essay on Woman  it has been thought that the author of the  Divine Legation  has been spoken of too freely but Mr  Voltaire  who is certainly as good a Christian as Mr  Wilkes  has lately treated the Bishop in much the same manner  one production at least in point of sentiment he is supposed to have equalled if not excelled both a  Rochester  and an  The Author here means only to refer to a poem  commonly  imputed to  Aristotle  which from its superiority is entitled his  Masterpiece    Aristotle  In progress of time he applied himself to more important studies and became not only a most excellent  And yet some one was base enough to apply the following character to him  Thersites only clamour'd in the throng  Loquacious loud and turbulent of tongueâ–ª  Aw'd by no shame by no respect controul'd  In scandal busy in reproaches bold  But chief he gloried with licentious style  To lash the Great and Monarchs to revile  His figure such as might his soul proclaim  One eye was blinking  Spleen to mankind his envious heart possest  For much he hated all but most the Best  POPE's Iliad  orator but likewise took in subscriptions for publishing  The Introduction is published  the history of his own country an amazing work this when one considers all his other occupations  that he was at that time under innumerable difficulties nay was absolutely engaged to furnish out twoandthirty paragraphs a day in each newspaper besides letters advertisements epigrams and intelligence extraordinary  But the nevertobeforgotten work was the  North Briton  or rather the N  o    All numbers that have proved fortunate to this country from that time have always terminated in  Fortyfive  and it is very remarkable that the Number  Nine  which consists of a  Four  and a  Five  should emphatically be stiled the Curse of  Scotland    of that celebrated  paper written by the late Reverend Mr  Churchill  and containing many spirited attacks against government which not being well received a process was preferred against the author Mr  Wilkes  being never likely to have a more fair or honourable introduction to glory generously declared the paper to be his own defied all government and has been admired and rewarded for it In short in all his writings whether he arraigned the opinions of others or established any doctrines of his own there were always found both the harmony  of order and the decency of religion His reasons were solid and convincing his inductions pleasing and agreeable he was master of every subject of which he treated and treated none but what were amply for the benefit of mankind  But  Mr  Wilkes  at that time had not the pleasure of Mr  Bull  's acquaintance  fearing some Creditors and having suffered in a Duel he travelled into  France  with many other great men for the recovery of his health and fortune There  he lived in ease and affluence supplied with money from the disinterested in  England  as well as with large sums arising from the sale of Jewels and other articles which his skill and address procured him abroadHis body daily gaining strength he was soon most earnestly sollicited to return to  England  where he again furbished up his Rhetoric and reexcited all his political faculties For some time he wished to have retired to his estate at  Aylesbury  but thinking it wrong to give the trouble of long journies to those who made suit to  him he gave up his estate there to be divided amongst his friends and then resided altogether in town for the convenience of public business and indeed there were not fewer attending at his door than formerly on  Croesus  for his wealth or  Pompey  for his power  And now being full of expectation and solely bent on the welfare of the public he consulted an oracle how he should soonest arrive at the Summit of all Political GloryThe  Pythian  replied that he must renounce  his constituents at  Aylesbury  and make the opinion of the  Londoners  the rule and guide of his lifeThe decrees of fate are irresistibleIndeed he would have submitted to have represented the city of  London  but his friends most prudently prevented him and compelled him to blaze out at once as the Member for  Middlesex  amidst the united acclamations of a grateful kingdom  Twelve men from a spirit of patriotism drew Mr  Wilkes  through the city and as appeared from one of his agents books agreed only for the small sum of twelve pound twelve as a gratuity for their services  From this happy event every  Englishman  might justly  have expected to have dated the aera of his felicity A Legislator representing what is called the first County burning with a religious zeal to execute his important charge and fully qualified to regulate with an eye of intuition every the minutest deviation from the just equilibre of church and state but such alas is the fate of all human things that the people were no sooner put in possession of their greatest blessing than they were deprived  of it The Parliament spoke sparingly of his merits and as he had been imprisoned for treason and blasphemy were willing to vindicate one bad action by committing another They asserted that as  no felon was eligible into any important office a man so like a felon that he could not be distinguished ought certainly to be expelled  but let me remind these gentlemen that the contrary was justified by many of the most experienced lawyers at that time and has since been well explained by the  Though Mr  Wilkes  neither takes his seat in parliament nor resides at the MansionHouse he had undoubtedly a Majority of Voices for both  Majority  of the city of  London  who are now fully convinced that felony though punishable in a private man is by no means a disqualification for a Lord Mayor The Head say the best Logicians is no Member  He was now not only deprived of his legal seat but shut up from daylight within the melancholy confines of a gloomy prison but these hardships he could well  have borne himself but his Humanity was alarmed for the welfare of others"All honest Freeholders as Lord  Chatham  beautifully expressed it were most dreadfully aggrieved from the Banks of the  Tweed  to the Landsend in  Cornwall  they slept not in their beds from horrid dreams and midnight apprehensions but it was not in dreams alas they had in vain implored the just assistance of a relentless Monarch" tender and pathetic as this lamentation was there yet was found a Peer hardy enough to  say "that the County in which he lived as well as five or six more adjoining had not only not petitioned but he believed felt no grievances and he was sorry the Noble Lord would not allow him one honest Freeholder in his neighbourhood"This appeared to many but as illtimed raillery and so far from invalidating the truth of the Great Orator's assertion that it only afforded a melancholy proof of Lord  Sandwich  's apostacy I will not dwell on the many dreadful consequences attending Mr  Wilkes  's expulsion the  reader the generous reader feels the weight of them too forcibly and I see him with tears in his eyes lamenting that luckless hour when virtue was strip'd of its ornament honesty of its robe and a fatal an everlasting blow was given to the very vitals of the Constitution  The Ministerial Hirelings now daily echoed reproaches against him they insinuated that he had defrauded the Foundling Hospital and burnt Mr  Sylva  's NotesThe latter was the only circumstance that seemed to endanger  his credit in the city it was a bad precedent and they feared it might prove dangerous to trade weak minds cannot always weigh the comparative merits of actionsbad measures must frequently be applied to good ends and private honesty is ofttimes absolutely incompatible with publick patriotism by many it was called at least an act of inattention but would it not have been deemed as the height of absurdity that a  Cicero  or a  Maecenas  should have stopped to have regulated a Grocer's bill when the welfare of millions  depended on their public counsels  Pericles  one of the most admired heroes of antiquity when his accounts were confused and could not well be given up not only destroyed the Notes if I may so express it but to drown the remembrance involved his country in the  Peloponnesian  war But I will place the matter in its true light The Notes were given to a  Jew  he was importunate Mr  Wilkes  was obliged to turn him out of his house in his own defence for is not a  Jew  bound whenever it is in his power to destroy that man  who is known to be a strenuous assertor of the laws of ChristianityAs to the Foundling Hospital Mr  Wilkes  considered it as a base Institution from the beginning it encouraged Bastardyhowever he submitted the whole transaction to the  Taylor White  Treasurer whose private virtues might be said to go hand in hand with his own and from whose representation of the case the city seemed so well satisfied of their equal integrity that they gave an entire credit to the one and by choosing the other Alderman  not only made him the Guardian of public trust but of course Governor to almost all other Hospitals  The Honour of being Alderman likewise entitled him to the high and important office of Sheriff which afforded him many favourable opportunities of displaying his Humanity he felt most tenderly for those who partook of one common nature with himself and in his Zeal for Liberty not only ordered their chains to be struck off during their trials but insisted on their  removal from  Newgate  to be more immediately under his own inspection that he might occasionally instruct them in their several duties and let them out at proper times to practise their different occupations in order to discharge the jailors fees Nor was this glorious plan of Liberty confined to one set of men only all ranks all orders in some degree felt the weight of his influence The messengers and officers who before had used to take up any man whom the Parliament deemed highly criminal now tremble least the Lord  Mayor should order them to be imprisoned and their criminal released and the Magistrate who before looked formidable on the Bench and intimidated the prisoner beneath him now shrinks back from a commitment least the Patriots being displeased his house should be burnt down or his family destroyed nay should the Clergy presume to restrain the people with the shackles of religion or my Lord Chief Justice himself to bend their necks beneath the galling load of Power Mr  Wilkes  has explained that all Authority is Tyranny and Dr  Wilson  and Mr  Horne  that Religion is Imposture Nor is this the system of a day only but the education of our youth is calculated to inculcate these generous principlesthe poor Apprentice who before had used to read his Bible in the evening or play at Cribbage with his Mistress now leaves the house and discourses like a  Lacedaemonian    Vid Life of  Lycurgus    not on the price of Pepper but passes his judgment on some action worth considering  openly ridicules the religion of his country  at the  Robinhood  or regulates the measures of Government in a more private Assembly  Not even the Military could repress Mr  Wilkes  's ardour at his instigation those splendid Hirelings were restrained from carrying arms through the city their very drum was silenced and they were taught that though they were kept at a vast expence to parade in  HydePark  and now and then to be reviewed yet they were to be considered as the ornament not as the security of the State and it was unconstitutional  for them to interfere though the Life of their Sovereign was attacked in his Palace  Nor were those learned Gentlemen of the Long Robe more secure in their dignities Mr  Wilkes  could explain to a  Middlesex  Jury that the King had no right to the Landtax that his power and that of the Parliament was not equal to that of a Petty Constable's and it was illegal for him in any instance to extend his mercy when the people clamoured for blood nay when the late Judge  Yates  presumed only  in passing sentence on Mr  Wilkes  to glance at his poem by speaking of the reverence due to Christianity the people such was the Patriot's popularity laughed him openly to scorn though Mr  Wilkes  himself with great politeness and candour said that  now and then it was not amiss to hear a musty sermon  He might even be said to be out of the power of Medicine for on the Parliament desiring a Physician to inspect him whilst in danger from a duel he dismissed  Hebberden  for being illiterate  and ordered no one to interfere unless they would send nurse  Grenve  herself to administer a glister  By extending the liberty of the Press all public and private characters are now fully delineated from this great prerogative the birthright of all  Englishmen  we are enabled to speak truth with impunity to say that  Vid  Junius  and others  a "  Mansfield  has no integrity a  Grafton  no abilities and that the Duke of  Bedford  rejoiced at the  death of his only son that the person of our Sovereign is ungracious his manners depraved his private character immoral and his public one unjust that he is the worst orator that ever spoke to a parliament a parent unconcerned in the welfare of his family has no care for the State but like  Nero  "fiddles whilst  Rome  is burning"  The Fine Arts live not but in a state of Liberty but now they flourish'd in all their branches Music was united with Poetry and Mr  Wilkes  their  Apollo    struck the master lyre his poetry was a mixed species of the Lyric and Didactic but managed with such amazing skill that it was echoed not only from the  Tower  to  Tyburn  but  balladed  about through every Fair and Markettown in the kingdom but as  Tacitus  observes  Homines plus oculis quam auribus credunt longum iter per praecepta per exempla breve et efficax TACITUS  "Men sooner believe their eyes than their ears" so he gave great encouragement likewise to all Artists to line their shops with Prints Emblems Sketches and Aenigmatic Characters  such as should not merely show the Delicacy of their Art but convey either a Fable Moral or History and he had the pleasing satisfaction to find that a  Fox hanging  a  Load of Straw  or a  suspended Boot  had more effect not only on the multitude but even on the City of  London  than all the accumulated labours of a University Library  It was Mr  Wilkes  's peculiar happiness to be always connected with characters similar to his own as they say the Magnet attracts  only those fragments that are of kindred qualities but now and then these fragments were at enmity amongst themselves when altercations arose about the disposal of Places or the distribution of Public Money they harrangued so freely on their comparative merits that though I have no doubt but they all spoke Truth of one another yet I think it was sometimes rather impolitic so fully to unveil to the common eye the deeper mysteries of Patriotic Duty  Every period of History affords some striking instances of the triumphs of Virtue over Power a  Cromwell  at one time and a  Tyler  at another have been equally the Idols of the Many the very Children of one  Henry II  Prince not only revolted against but destroy'd their Father from Mr  Wilkes  then who is a glorious Compound of all these illustrious Characters what may not be expected for unhappily for this nation it is governed by a King who holds Principles DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE he has  been justly reviled by his People  and the Voice of the People isthe Voice of GOD  FINIS
