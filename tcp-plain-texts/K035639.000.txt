 THE EMIGRANTS  THE EMIGRANTS A  POEM  IN TWO BOOKS  BY CHARLOTTE SMITH  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND  TO WILLIAM COWPER ESQ  DEAR SIR  THERE is I hope some propriety in my addressing a Composition to you which would never perhaps have existed had I not amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows derived infinite consolation from your Poetry and some degree of animation and of confidence from your esteem  The following performance is far from aspiring to be considered as an imitation of your inimitable Poem "  THE TASK  " I am perfectly sensible that it belongs not to a feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulysses  The force clearness and sublimity of your admirable Poem the felicity almost peculiar to your genius of giving to the most familiar objects dignity and effect I could never hope to  reach yet having read "The Task" almost incessantly from its first publication to the present time I felt that kind of enchantment described by Milton when he says  The Angel ended and in Adam's ear  So charming left his voice that he awhile  Thought him still speaking  And from the force of this impression I was gradually led to attempt in Blank Verse a delineation of those interesting objects which happened to excite my attention and which even pressed upon an heart that has learned perhaps from its own sufferings to feel with acute though unavailing compassion the calamity of others  A Dedication usually consists of praises and of apologies  my  praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applause of your country She regards you with pride as one of the few who at the present period rescue her from the imputation of having degenerated in Poetical talents but in the form of Apology I should have much to say if I again dared to plead the pressure of evils aggravated by their long continuance as an excuse for the defects of this attempt  Whatever may be the faults of its execution let me vindicate myself from those that may be imputed to the design In speaking of the Emigrant Clergy I beg to be understood as feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduct of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in England which has been such as does honour to  their  nation and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal mind  Your philanthropy dear Sir will induce you I am persuaded to join with me in hoping that this painful exile may finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so unworthy of great and enlightened nations that it may tend to humanize both countries by convincing each that good qualities exist in the other and at length annihilate the prejudices that have so long existed to the injury of both  Yet it is unfortunately but too true that with the body of the English this national aversion has acquired new force by the dreadful scenes which have been acted in France during  the last summereven those who are the victims of the Revolution have not escaped the odium which the undistinguishing multitude annex to all the natives of a country where such horrors have been acted nor is this the worst effect those events have had on the minds of the English by confounding the original cause with the wretched catastrophes that have followed its ill management the attempts of public virtue with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its disguise the very name of Liberty has not only lost the charm it used to have in British ears but many who have written or spoken in its defence have been stigmatized as promoters of Anarchy and enemies to the prosperity of their country Perhaps even the Author of "The Task" with all his goodness and tenderness of heart is in the catalogue of those who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause which it was once the glory of Englishmen to avow and defend The exquisite Poem indeed in which you have honoured Liberty by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest friends was published some years before the demolition of regal despotisin in France which in the fifth book it seems  to foretellAll the truth and energy of the passage to which I allude must have been strongly felt when in the Parliament of England the greatest Orator of our time quoted the sublimest of our Poetswhen the eloquence of Fox did justice to the genius of Cowper  I am dear SIR With the most perfect esteem Your obliged and obedient servant CHARLOTTE SMITH  Brighthelmstone  May  Lately

FIRST  BOOK I  SCENE on the Cliffs to the Eastward of the Town of Brighthelmstone in Sussex  TIME a Morning in November  SLOW in the Wintry Morn the struggling light  Throws a faint gleam upon the troubled waves  Their foaming tops as they approach the shore  And the broad surf that never ceasing breaks  On the innumerous pebbles catch the beams  Of the pale Sun that with reluctance gives  To this cold northern Isle its shorten'd day  Alas how few the morning wakes to joy  How many murmur at oblivious night  For leaving them so soon for bearing thus  Their fancied bliss the only bliss they taste  On her black wings awayChanging the dreams  That sooth'd their sorrows for calamities  And every day brings its own sad proportion  For doubts diseases abject dread of Death  And faithless friends and fame and fortune lost  Fancied or real wants and wounded pride  That views the day star but to curse his beams  Yet He whose Spirit into being call'd  This wond'rous World of Waters He who bids  The wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds  And speaks to them in thunder or whose breath  Low murmuring o'er the gently heaving tides  When the fair Moon in summer night serene  Irradiates with long trembling lines of light  Their undulating surface that great Power  Who governing the Planets also knows  If but a SeaMew falls whose nest is hid  In these incumbent cliffs He surely means  To us his reasoning Creatures whom He bids  Acknowledge and revere his awful hand  Nothing but good Yet Man misguided Man  Mars the fair work that he was bid enjoy  And makes himself the evil he deplores  How often when my weary soul recoils  From proud oppression and from legal crimes  For such are in this Land where the vain boast  Of equal Law is mockery while the cost  Of seeking for redress is sure to plunge  Th' already injur'd to more certain ruin  And the wretch starves before his Counsel pleads  How often do I half abjure Society  And sigh for some lone Cottage deep embower'd  In the green woods that these steep chalky Hills  Guard from the strong South West where round their base  The Beach wide flourishes and the light Ash  With slender leaf half hides the thymy turf  There do I wish to hide me well content  If on the short grass strewn with fairy flowers  I might repose thus shelter'd or when Eve  In Orient crimson lingers in the west  Gain the high mound and mark these waves remote  Lucid tho' distant blushing with the rays  Of the farflaming Orb that sinks beneath them  For I have thought that I should then behold  The beauteous works of God unspoil'd by Man  And less affected then by human woes  I witness'd not might better learn to bear  Those that injustice and duplicity  And faithlessness and folly fix on me  For never yet could I derive relief  When my swol'n heart was bursting with its sorrows  From the sad thought that others like myself  Live but to swell affliction's countless tribes  Tranquil seclusion I have vainly sought  Peace who delights in solitary shade  No more will spread for me her downy wings  But like the fabled Danaidsor the wretch  Who ceaseless up the steep acclivity  Was doom'd to heave the still rebounding rock  Onward I labour as the baffled wave  Which you rough beach repulses that returns  With the next breath of wind to fail again  Ah Mournercease these wailings cease and learn  That not the Cot sequester'd where the briar  And woodbine wild embrace the mossy thatch  Scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure  Or more substantial farm well fenced and warm  Where the full barn and cattle fodder'd round  Speak rustic plenty nor the statelier dome  By dark firs shaded or the aspiring pine  Close by the village Church with care conceal'd  By verdant foliage lest the poor man's grave  Should mar the smiling prospect of his Lord  Where offices well rang'd or dovecote stock'd  Declare manorial residence not these  Or any of the buildings new and trim  With windows circling towards the restless Sea  Which ranged in rows now terminate my walk  Can shut out for an hour the spectre Care  That from the dawn of reason follows still  Unhappy Mortals 'till the friendly grave  Our sole secure asylum "ends the chace    "  Behold in witness of this mournful truth  A group approach me whose dejected looks  Sad Heralds of distress proclaim them Men  Banish'd for ever and for conscience sake  From their distracted Country whence the name  Of Freedom misapplied and much abus'd  By lawless Anarchy has driven them far  To wander with the prejudice they learn'd  From Bigotry the Tut'ress of the blind  Thro' the wide World unshelter'd their sole hope  That German spoilers thro' that pleasant land  May carry wide the desolating scourge  Of War and Vengeance yet unhappy Men  Whate'er your errors I lament your fate  And as disconsolate and sad ye hang  Upon the barrier of the rock and seem  To murmur your despondence waiting long  Some fortunate reverse that never comes  Methinks in each expressive face I see  Discriminated anguish there droops one  Who in a moping cloister long consum'd  This life inactive to obtain a better  And thought that meagre abstinence to wake  From his hard pallet with the midnight bell  To live on eleemosynary bread  And to renounce God's works would please that God  And now the poor pale wretch receives amaz'd  The pity strangers give to his distress  Because these strangers are by his dark creed  Condemn'd as Hereticsand with sick heart  Regrets    his pious prison and his beads  Another of more haughty port declines  The aid he needs not while in mute despair  His high indignant thoughts go back to France  Dwelling on all he lostthe Gothic dome  That vied with splendid palaces    the beds  Of silk and down the silver chalices  Vestments with gold enwrought for blazing altars  Where amid clouds of incense he held forth  To kneeling crowds the imaginary bones  Of Saints suppos'd in pearl and gold enchas'd  And still with more than living Monarchs' pomp  Surrounded was believ'd by mumbling bigots  To hold the keys of Heaven and to admit  Whom he thought good to share itNow alas  He to whose daring soul and high ambition  The World seem'd circumscrib'd who wont to dream  Of Fleuri Richelieu Alberoni men  Who trod on Empire and whose politics  Were not beyond the grasp of his vast mind  Is in a Land once hostile still prophan'd  By disbelief and rites unorthodox  The object of compassionAt his side  Lighter of heart than these but heavier far  Than he was wont another victim comes  An Abbéwho with less contracted brow  Still smiles and flatters and still talks of Hope  Which sanguine as he is he does not feel  And so he cheats the sad and weighty pressure  Of evils presentStill as Men misled  By early prejudice so hard to break  I mourn your sorrows for I too have known  Involuntary exile and while yet  England had charms for me have felt how sad  It is to look across the dim cold sea  That melancholy rolls its refluent tides  Between us and the dear regretted land  We call our ownas now ye pensive wait  On this bleak morning gazing on the waves  That seem to leave your shore from whence the wind  Is loaded to your ears with the deep groans  Of martyr'd Saints and suffering Royalty  While to your eyes the avenging power of Heaven  Appears in aweful anger to prepare  The storm of vengeance fraught with plagues and death  Even he of milder heart who was indeed  The simple shepherd in a rustic scene  And 'mid the vineclad hills of Languedoc  Taught to the barefoot peasant whose hard hands  Produc'd    the nectar he could seldom taste  Submission to the Lord for whom he toil'd  He or his brethren who to Neustria's sons  Enforc'd religious patience when at times  On their indignant hearts Power's iron hand  Too strongly struck eliciting some sparks  Of the bold spirit of their native North  Even these Parochial Priests these humbled men  Whose lowly undistinguish'd cottages  Witness'd a life of purest piety  While the meek tenants were perhaps unknown  Each to the haughty Lord of his domain  Who mark'd them not the Noble scorning still  The poor and pious Priest as with slow pace  He glided thro' the dim arch'd avenue  Which to the Castle led hoping to cheer  The last sad hour of some laborious life  That hasten'd to its closeeven such a Man  Becomes an exile staying not to try  By temperate zeal to check his madd'ning flock  Who at the novel sound of Liberty  Ah most intoxicating sound to slaves  Start into licenceLo dejected now  The wandering Pastor mourns with bleeding heart  His erring people weeps and prays for them  And trembles for the account that he must give  To Heaven for souls entrusted to his care  Where the cliff hollow'd by the wintry storm  Affords a seat with matted seaweed strewn  A softer form reclines around her run  On the rough shingles or the chalky bourn  Her gay unconscious children soon amus'd  Who pick the fretted stone or glossy shell  Or crimson plant marine or they contrive  The fairy vessel with its ribband sail  And gilded paper pennant in the pool  Left by the salt wave on the yielding sands  They launch the mimic navyHappy age  Unmindful of the miseries of Man  Alas too long a victim to distress  Their Mother lost in melancholy thought  Lull'd for a moment by the murmurs low  Of sullen billows wearied by the task  Of having here with swol'n and aching eyes  Fix'd on the grey horizon since the dawn  Solicitously watch'd the weekly sail  From her dear native land now yields awhile  To kind forgetfulness while Fancy brings  In waking dreams that native land again  Versailles appearsits painted galleries  And rooms of regal splendour rich with gold  Where by long mirrors multiply'd the crowd  Paid willing homageand united there  Beauty gave charms to empireAh too soon  From the gay visionary pageant rous'd  See the sad mourner startand drooping look  With tearful eyes and heaving bosom round  On drear realitywhere dark'ning waves  Urg'd by the rising wind unheeded foam  Near her cold rugged seatTo call her thence  A fellowsufferer comes dejection deep  Checks but conceals not quite the martial air  And that high consciousness of noble blood  Which he has learn'd from infancy to think  Exalts him o'er the race of common men  Nurs'd in the velvet lap of luxury  And fed by adulationcould  he  learn  That worth alone is true Nobility  And that  the peasant  who "amid    the sons  "Of Reason Valour Liberty and Virtue  "Displays distinguish'd merit is a Noble  "Of Nature's own creation"If even here  If in this land of highly vaunted Freedom  Even Britons controvert the unwelcome truth  Can it be relish'd by the sons of France  Men who derive their boasted ancestry  From the fierce leaders of religious wars  The first in Chivalry's emblazon'd page  Who reckon Gueslin Bayard or De Foix  Among their brave Progenitors  Their  eyes  Accustom'd to regard the splendid trophies  Of Heraldry that with fantastic hand  Mingles like images in feverish dreams  "Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire"  With painted puns and visionary shapes  See not the simple dignity of Virtue  But hold all base whom honours such as these  Exalt not from the crowd    As one who long  Has dwelt amid the artificial scenes  Of populous City deems that splendid shows  The Theatre and pageant pomp of Courts  Are only worth regard forgets all taste  For Nature's genuine beauty in the lapse  Of gushing waters hears no soothing sound  Nor listens with delight to sighing winds  That on their fragrant pinions waft the notes  Of birds rejoicing in the trangled copse  Nor gazes pleas'd on Ocean's silver breast  While lightly o'er it sails the summer clouds  Reflected in the wave that hardly heard  Flows on the yellow sands so to  his  mind  That long has liv'd where Despotism hides  His features harsh beneath the diadem  Of worldly grandeur abject Slavery seems  If by that power impos'd slavery no more  For luxury wreathes with silk the iron bonds  And hides the ugly rivets with her flowers  Till the degenerate triflers while they love  The glitter of the chains forget their weight  But more the Men    whose ill acquir'd wealth  Was wrung from plunder'd myriads by the means  Too often legaliz'd by power abus'd  Feel all the horrors of the fatal change  When their ephemeral greatness marr'd at once  As a vain toy that Fortune's childish hand  Equally joy'd to fashion or to crush  Leaves them expos'd to universal scorn  For having nothing else not even the claim  To honour which respect for Heroes past  Allows to ancient titles Men like these  Sink even beneath the level whence base arts  Alone had rais'd themunlamented sink  And know that they deserve the woes they feel  Poor wand'ring wretches whosoe'er ye are  That hopeless houseless friendless travel wide  O'er these bleak russet downs where dimly seen  The solitary Shepherd shiv'ring tends  His dun discolour'd flock Shepherd unlike  Him whom in song the Poet's fancy crowns  With garlands and his crook with vi'lets binds  Poor vagrant wretches outcasts of the world  Whom no abode receives no parish owns  Roving like Nature's commoners the land  That boasts such general plenty if the sight  Of wideextended misery softens yours  A while suspend your murmurshere behold  The strange vicissitudes of fatewhile thus  The exil'd Nobles from their country driven  Whose richest luxuries were their's must feel  More poignant anguish than the lowest poor  Who born to indigence have learn'd to brave  Rigid Adversity's depressing breath  Ah rather Fortune's worthless favourites  Who feed on England's vitalsPensioners  Of base corruption who in quick ascent  To opulence unmerited become  Giddy with pride and as ye rise forgetting  The dust ye lately left with scorn look down  On those beneath ye tho' your  equals  once  In fortune  and  in worth superior still    They view the eminence on which ye stand  With wonder not with envy for they know  The means by which ye reach'd it have been such  As in all honest eyes degrade ye far  Beneath the poor dependent whose fad heart  Reluctant pleads for what your pride denies  Ye venal worthless hirelings of a Court  Ye pamper'd Parasites whom Britons pay  For forging fetters for them rather here  Study a lesson that concerns ye much  And trembling learn that if oppress'd too long  The raging multitude to madness stung  Will turn on their oppressors and no more  By sounding titles and parading forms  Bound like tame victims will redress themselves  Then swept away by the resistlefs torrent  Not only all your pomp may disappear  But in the tempest lost fair Order sink  Her decent head and lawless Anarchy  O'erturn celestial Freedom's radiant throne  As now in Gallia where Confusion born  Of party rage and selfish love of rule  Sully the noblest cause that ever warm'd  The heart of Patriot Virtue    There arise  The infernal passions Vengeance seeking blood  And Avarice and Envy's harpy fangs  Pollute the immortal shrine of Liberty  Dismay her votaries and disgrace her name  Respect is due to principle and they  Who suffer for their conscience have a claim  Whate'er that principle may be to praise  These illstarr'd Exiles then who bound by ties  To them the bonds of honour who resign'd  Their country to preserve them and now seek  In England an asylumwell deserve  To find that every prejudice forgot  Which pride and ignorance teaches we for them  Feel as our brethren and that English hearts  Of just compassion ever own the sway  As truly as our element the deep  Obeys the mild dominion of the Moon  This they  have  found and may they find it still  Thus may'st thou Britain triumphMay thy foes  By Reason's gen'rous potency subdued  Learn that the God thou worshippest delights  In acts of pure humanityMay thine  Be still such bloodless laurels nobler far  Than those acquir'd at Cressy or Poictiers  Or of more recent growth those well bestow'd  On him who stood on Calpe's blazing height  Amid the thunder of a warring world  Illustrious rather from the crowds he sav'd  From flood and fire than from the ranks who fell  Beneath his valourActions such as these  Like incense rising to the Throne of Heaven  Far better justify the pride that swells  In British bosoms than the deafening roar  Of Victory from a thousand brazen throats  That tell with what success widewasting War  Has by our brave Compatriots thinned the world  END OF BOOK I  NOTES TO THE FIRST BOOK  "ENDS the chace"I have a confused notion that this expression with nearly the same application is to be found in Young but I cannot refer to it  "Regrets his pious prison and his beads"Lest the same attempts at misrepresentation should now be made as have been made on former occasions it is necessary to repeat that nothing is farther from my thoughts than to reflect invidiously on the Emigrant Clergy whose steadiness of principle excites veneration as much as their sufferings compassion Adversity has now taught them the charity and humility they perhaps wanted when they made it a part of their faith that salvation could be obtained in no other religion than their own  "The splendid palaces"Let it not be considered as an insult to men in fallen fortune if these luxuries undoubtedly inconsistent with their profession be here enumeratedFrance is not the only country where the splendour and indulgences of the higher and the poverty and depression of the inferior Clergy have alike proved injurious to the cause of Religion  See the finely descriptive Verses written at Montauban in France in by Dr Joseph Warton Printed in Dodsley's Miscellanies Vol IV page  "Who amid the sons  "Of Reason Valour Liberty and Virtue  "Displays distinguished merit is a Noble  "Of Nature's own creation"  These lines are Thomson's and are among those sentiments which are now called when used by living writers not commonplace declamation but sentiments of dangerous tendency  "Exalt not from the crowd"It has been said and with great appearance of truth that the contempt in which the Nobility of France held the common people was remembered and with all that vindictive asperity which long endurance of oppression naturally excites when by a wonderful concurrence of circumstances the people acquired the power of retaliation Yet let me here add what seems to be in some degree inconsistent with the former charge that the French are good masters to their servants and that in their treatment of their Negro slaves they are allowed to be more mild and merciful than other Europeans  "But more the Men"The Financiers and Fermiers Generaux are here intended In the present moment of clamour against all those who have spoken or written in favour of the first Revolution of France the declaimers seem to have forgotten that under the reign of a mild and easy tempered Monarch in the most voluptuous Court in the world the abuses by which men of this description were enriched had arisen to such height that their prodigality exhausted the immense resources of France and unable to supply the exigencies of Government the Ministry were compelled to call Le Tiers Etat a meeting that gave birth to the Revolution which has since been so ruinously conducted  "The breast of Patriot Virtue"This sentiment will probably  renew  against me the indignation of those who have an interest in asserting that no such virtue any where exists  THE EMIGRANTS  BOOK THE SECOND  Quippe ubi fas

View of the Sea to the North of the Weald of Sussex  TIME an Afternoon in April  LONG wintry months are past the Moon that now  Lights her pale crescent even at noon has made  Four times her revolution since with step  Mournful and slow along the waveworn cliff  Pensive I took my solitary way  Lost in despondence while contemplating  Not my own wayward destiny alone  Hard as it is and difficult to bear  But in beholding the unhappy lot  Of the lorn Exiles who amid the storms  Of wild disastrous Anarchy are thrown  Like shipwreck'd sufferers on England's coast  To see perhaps no more their native land  Where Desolation riots They like me  From fairer hopes and happier prospects driven  Shrink from the future and regret the past  But on this Upland scene while April comes  With fragrant airs to fan my throbbing breast  Fain would I snatch an interval from Care  That weighs my wearied spirit down to earth  Courting once more the influence of Hope  For "Hope" still waits upon the flowery prime  As here I mark Spring's humid hand unfold  The early leaves that fear capricious winds  While even on shelter'd banks the timid flowers  Give half reluctantly their warmer hues  To mingle with the primroses' pale stars  No shade the leafless copses yet afford  Nor hide the mossy labours of the Thrush  That startled darts across the narrow path  But quickly reassur'd resumes his task  Or adds his louder notes to those that rise  From yonder tufted brake where the white buds  Of the first thorn are mingled with the leaves  Of that which blossoms on the brow of May  Ah 'twill not beSo many years have pass'd  Since on my native hills I learn'd to gaze  On these delightful landscapes and those years  Have taught me so much sorrow that my soul  Feels not the joy reviving Nature brings  But in dark retrospect dejected dwells  On human follies and on human woes  What is the promise of the infant year  The lively verdure or the bursting blooms  To those who shrink from horrors such as War  Spreads o'er the affrighted world With swimming eye  Back on the past they throw their mournful looks  And see the Temple which they fondly hop'd  Reason would raise to Liberty destroy'd  By ruffian hands while on the ruin'd mass  Flush'd with hot blood the Fiend of Discord sits  In savage triumph mocking every plea  Of policy and justice as she shews  The headless corse of one whose only crime  Was being born a MonarchMercy turns  From spectacle so dire her swol'n eyes  And Liberty with calm unruffled brow  Magnanimous as conscious of her strength  In Reason's panoply scorns to distain  Her righteous cause with carnage and resigns  To Fraud and Anarchy the infuriate crowd  What is the promise of the infant year  To those who while the poor but peaceful hind  Pens unmolested the encreasing flock  Of his rich master in this seafenc'd isle  Survey in neighbouring countries scenes that make  The sick heart shudder and the Man who thinks  Blush for his species  There  the trumpet's voice  Drowns the soft warbling of the woodland choir  And violets lurking in their turfy beds  Beneath the flow'ring thorn are stain'd with blood  There fall at once the spoiler and the spoil'd  While War wideravaging annihilates  The hope of cultivation gives to Fiends  The meagre ghastly Fiends of Want and Woe  The blasted landThere taunting in the van  Of vengeancebreathing armies Insult stalks  And in the ranks "    Famine and Sword and Fire  "Crouch for employment"Lo the suffering world  Torn by the fearful conflict shrinks amaz'd  From Freedom's name usurp'd and misapplied  And cow'ring to the purple Tyrant's rod  Deems  that  the lesser illDeluded Men  Ere ye prophane her everglorious name  Or catalogue the thousands that have bled  Resisting her or those who greatly died  Martyrs to  Liberty  revert awhile  To the black scroll that tells of regal crimes  Committed to destroy her rather count  The hecatombs of victims who have fallen  Beneath a single despot or who gave  Their wasted lives for some disputed claim  Between anointed robbers    Monsters both  "    Oh Polish'd perturbationgolden care"  So strangely coveted by feeble Man  To lift him o'er his fellowsToy for which  Such showers of blood have drench'd th' affrighted earth  Unfortunate  his  lot whose luckless head  Thy jewel'd circlet lin'd with thorns has bound  And who by custom's laws obtains from thee  Hereditary right to rule uncheck'd  Submissive myriads for untemper'd power  Like steel ill form'd injures the hand  It promis'd to protectUnhappy France  If e'er thy lilies trampled now in dust  And bloodbespotted shall again revive  In silver splendour may the wreath be wov'n  By voluntary hands and Freemen such  As England's self might boast unite to place  The guarded diadem on  his  fair brow  Where Loyalty may join with Liberty  To fix it firmlyIn the rugged school  Of stern Adversity so early train'd  His future life perchance may emulate  That of the brave Bernois    so justly call'd  The darling of his people who rever'd  The Warrior less than they ador'd the Man  But ne'er may Party Rage perverse and blind  And base Venality prevail to raise  To public trust a wretch whose private vice  Makes even the wildest profligate recoil  And who with hireling ruffians leagu'd has burst  The laws of Nature and Humanity  Wading beneath the Patriot's specious mask  And in Equality's illusive name  To empire thro' a stream of kindred blood  Innocent prisonermost unhappy heir  Of fatal greatness who art suffering now  For all the crimes and follies of thy race  Better for thee if o'er thy baby brow  The regal mischief never had been held  Then in an humble sphere perhaps content  Thou hadst been free and joyous on the heights  Of Pyrennean mountains shagg'd with woods  Of chesnut pine and oak as on these hills  Is yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad  Who on the slope abrupt of downy turf  Reclin'd in playful indolence sends off  The chalky ball quick bounding far below  While half forgetful of his simple task  Hardly his length'ning shadow or the bells'  Slow tinkling of his flock that supping tend  To the brown fallows in the vale beneath  Where nightly it is folded from his sport  Recal the happy idlerWhile I gaze  On his gay vacant countenance my thoughts  Compare with his obscure laborious lot  Thine most unfortunate imperial Boy  Who round thy sullen prison daily hear'st  The savage howl of Murder as it seeks  Thy unoffending life while sad within  Thy wretched Mother petrified with grief  Views thee with stony eyes and cannot weep  Ah much I mourn thy sorrows hapless Queen  And deem thy expiation made to Heaven  For every fault to which Prosperity  Betray'd thee when it plac'd thee on a throne  Where boundless power was thine and thou wert rais'd  High as it seem'd above the envious reach  Of destiny Whate'er thy errors were  Be they no more remember'd tho' the rage  Of Party swell'd them to such crimes as bade  Compassion stifle every sigh that rose  For thy disastrous lotMore than enough  Thou hast endur'd and every English heart  Ev'n those that highest beat in Freedom's cause  Disclaim as base and of that cause unworthy  The Vengeance or the Fear that makes thee still  A miserable prisonerAh who knows  From sad experience more than I to feel  For thy desponding spirit as it sinks  Beneath procrastinated fears for those  More dear to thee than life But eminence  Of misery is thine as once of joy  And as we view the strange vicissitude  We ask anew where happiness is found  Alas in rural life where youthful dreams  See the Arcadia that Romance describes  Not even Content residesIn yon low hut  Of clay and thatch where rises the grey smoke  Of smold'ring turf cut from the adjoining moor  The labourer its inhabitant who toils  From the first dawn of twilight till the Sun  Sinks in the rosy waters of the West  Finds that with poverty it cannot dwell  For bread and scanty bread is all he earns  For him and for his householdShould Disease  Born of chill wintry rains arrest his arm  Then thro' his patch'd and strawstuff'd casement peeps  The squalid figure of extremest Want  And from the Parish the reluctant dole  Dealt by th' unfeeling farmer hardly saves  The ling'ring spark of life from cold extinction  Then the bright Sun of Spring that smiling bids  All other animals rejoice beholds  Crept from his pallet the emaciate wretch  Attempt with feeble effort to resume  Some heavy task above his wasted strength  Turning his wistful looks how much in vain  To the deserted mansion where no more  The owner gone to gayer scenes resides  Who made even luxury Virtue while he gave  The scatter'd crumbs to honest Poverty  But tho' the landscape be too oft deform'd  By figures such as these yet Peace is here  And o'er our vallies cloath'd with springing corn  No hostile hoof shall trample nor fierce flames  Wither the wood's young verdure ere it form  Gradual the laughing May's luxuriant shade  For by the rude sea guarded we are safe  And feel not evils such as with deep sighs  The Emigrants deplore as they recal  The Summer past when Nature seem'd to lose  Her course in wild distemperature and aid  With seasons all revers'd destructive War  Shuddering I view the pictures they have drawn  Of desolated countries where the ground  Stripp'd of its unripe produce was thick strewn  With various Deaththe warhorse falling there  By famine and his rider by the sword  The moping clouds sail'd heavy charg'd with rain  And bursting o'er the mountains misty brow  Deluged as with an inland sea the vales      Where thro' the sullen evening's lurid gloom  Rising like columns of volcanic fire  The flames of burning villages illum'd  The waste of water and the wind that howl'd  Along its troubled surface brought the groans  Of plunder'd peasants and the frantic shrieks  Of mothers for their children while the brave  To pity still alive listen'd aghast  To these dire echoes hopeless to prevent  The evils they beheld or check the rage  Which ever as the people of one land  Meet in contention fires the human heart  With savage thirst of kindred blood and makes  Man lose his nature rendering him more fierce  Than the gaunt monsters of the howling waste  Oft have I heard the melancholy tale  Which all their native gaiety forgot  These Exiles tellHow Hope impell'd them on  Reckless of tempest hunger or the sword  Till order'd to retreat they knew not why  From all their flattering prospects they became  The prey of dark suspicion and regret      Then in despondence sunk the unnerv'd arm  Of gallant LoyaltyAt every turn  Shame and disgrace appear'd and seem'd to mock  Their scatter'd squadrons which the warlike youth  Unable to endure    often implor'd  As the last act of friendship from the hand  Of some brave comrade to receive the blow  That freed the indignant spirit from its pain  To a wild mountain whose bare summit hides  Its broken eminence in clouds whose steeps  Are dark with woods where the receding rocks  Are worn by torrents of dissolving snow  A wretched Woman pale and breathless flies  And gazing round her listens to the sound  Of hostile footstepsNo it dies away  Nor noise remains but of the cataract  Or surly breeze of night that mutters low  Among the thickets where she trembling seeks  A temporary shelterclasping close  To her hardheaving heart her sleeping child  All she could rescue of the innocent groupe  That yesterday surrounded herEscap'd  Almost by miracle Fear frantic Fear  Wing'd her weak feet yet half repentant now  Her headlong haste she wishes she had staid  To die with those affrighted Fancy paints  The lawless soldier's victimsHark again  The driving tempest bears the cry of Death  And with deep sullen thunder the dread sound  Of cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth  While bursting in the air the murderous bomb  Glares o'er her mansion Where the splinters fall  Like scatter'd comets its destructive path  Is mark'd by wreaths of flameThen overwhelm'd  Beneath accumulated horror sinks  The desolate mourner yet in Death itself  True to maternal tenderness she tries  To save the unconscious infant from the storm  In which she perishes and to protect  This last dear object of her ruin'd hopes  From prowling monsters that from other hills  More inaccessible and wilder wastes  Lur'd by the scent of slaughter follow fierce  Contending hosts and to polluted fields  Add dire increase of horrorsBut alas  The Mother and the Infant perish both  The feudal Chief whose Gothic battlements  Frown on the plain beneath returning home  From distant lands alone and in disguise  Gains at the fall of night his Castle walls  But at the vacant gate no Porter sits  To wait his Lord's admittanceIn the courts  All is drear silenceGuessing but too well  The fatal truth he shudders as he goes  Thro' the mute hall where by the blunted light  That the dim moon thro' painted casements lends  He sees that devastation has been there  Then while each hideous image to his mind  Rises terrific o'er a bleeding corse  Stumbling he falls another interrupts  His staggering feetall all who us'd to rush  With joy to meet himall his family  Lie murder'd in his wayAnd the day dawns  On a wild raving Maniac whom a fate  So sudden and calamitous has robb'd  Of reason and who round his vacant walls  Screams unregarded and reproaches Heaven  Such are thy dreadful trophies savage War  And evils such as these or yet more dire  Which the pain'd mind recoils from all are thine  The purple Pestilence that to the grave  Sends whom the sword has spar'd is thine and thine  The Widow's anguish and the Orphan's tears  Woes such as these does Man inflict on Man  And by the closet murderers whom we style  Wise Politicians are the schemes prepar'd  Which to keep Europe's wavering balance even  Depopulate her kingdoms and consign  To tears and anguish half a bleeding world  Oh could the time return when thoughts like these  Spoil'd not that gay delight which vernal Suns  Illuminating hills and woods and fields  Gave to my infant spiritsMemory come  And from distracting cares that now deprive  Such scenes of all their beauty kindly bear  My fancy to those hours of simple joy  When on the banks of Arun which I see  Make its irriguous course thro' yonder meads  I play'd unconscious then of future ill  There where from hollows fring'd with yellow broom  The birch with silver rind and fairy leaf  Aslant the low stream trembles I have stood  And meditated how to venture best  Into the shallow current to procure  The willow herb of glowing purple spikes  Or flags whose swordlike leaves conceal'd the tide  Startling the timid reedbird from her nest  As with aquatic flowers I wove the wreath  Such as collected by the shepherd girls  Deck in the villages the turfy shrine  And mark the arrival of propitious May  How little dream'd I then the time would come  When the bright Sun of that delicious month  Should from disturb'd and artificial sleep  Awaken me to neverending toil  To terror and to tearsAttempting still  With feeble hands and cold desponding heart  To save my children from the o'erwhelming wrongs  That have for ten long years been heap'd on me  The fearful spectres of chicane and fraud  Have Proteus like still chang'd their hideous forms  As the Law lent its plausible disguise  Pursuing my faint steps and I have seen  Friendship's sweet bonds which were so early form'd  And once I fondly thought of amaranth  Inwove with silver seven times tried give way  And fail as these green fanlike leaves of fern  Will wither at the touch of Autumn's frost  Yet there  are those  whose patient pity still  Hears my long murmurs who unwearied try  With lenient hands to bind up every wound  My wearied spirit feels and bid me go  "Right onward  "a calm votary of the Nymph  Who from her adamantine rock points out  To conscious rectitude the rugged path  That leads at length to PeaceAh yes my friends  Peace will at last be mine for in the Grave  Is Peaceand pass a few short years perchance  A few short months and all the various pain  I now endure shall be forgotten there  And no memorial shall remain of me  Save in your bosoms while even  your  regret  Shall lose its poignancy as ye reflect  What complicated woes that grave conceals  But if the little praise that may await  The Mother's efforts should provoke the spleen  Of Priest or Levite and they then arraign  The dust that cannot hear them be it yours  To vindicate my humble fame to say  That not in selfish sufferings absorb'd  "I gave to misery all I had my tears    "  And if where regulated sanctity  Pours her long orisons to Heaven my voice  Was seldom heard that yet  my prayer  was made  To him who hears even silence not in domes  Of human architecture fill'd with crowds  But on these hills where boundless yet distinct  Even as a map beneath are spread the fields  His bounty cloaths divided here by woods  And there by commons rude or winding brooks  While I might breathe the air perfum'd with flowers  Or the fresh odours of the mountain turf  And gaze on clouds above me as they sail'd  Majestic or remark the reddening north  When bickering arrows of electric fire  Flash on the evening skyI made my prayer  In unison with murmuring waves that now  Swell with dark tempests now are mild and blue  As the bright arch above for all to me  Declare omniscient goodness nor need I  Declamatory essays to incite  My wonder or my praise when every leaf  That Spring unfolds and every simple bud  More forcibly impresses on my heart  His power and wisdomAh while I adore  That goodness which design'd to all that lives  Some taste of happiness my soul is pain'd  By the variety of woes that Man  For Man createshis blessings often turn'd  To plagues and curses Saintlike Piety  Misled by Superstition has destroy'd  More than Ambition and the sacred flame  Of Liberty becomes a raging fire  When Licence and Confusion bid it blaze  From thy high throne above yon radiant stars  O Power Omnipotent with mercy view  This suffering globe and cause thy creatures cease  With savage fangs to tear her bleeding breast  Restrain that rage for power that bids a Man  Himself a worm desire unbounded rule  O'er beings like himself Teach the hard hearts  Of rulers that the poorest hind who dies  For their unrighteous quarrels in thy sight  Is equal to the imperious Lord that leads  His disciplin'd destroyers to the field  May lovely Freedom in her genuine charms  Aided by stern but equal Justice drive  From the ensanguin'd earth the hellborn fiends  Of Pride Oppression Avarice and Revenge  That ruin what thy mercy made so fair  Then shall these illstarr'd wanderers whose sad fate  These desultory lines lament regain  Their native country private vengeance then  To public virtue yield and the fierce feuds  That long have torn their desolated land  May even as storms that agitate the air  Drive noxious vapours from the blighted earth  Serve all tremendous as they are to fix  The reign of Reason Liberty and Peace  NOTES TO THE SECOND BOOK  "HOPE waits upon the flowery prime"  "Famine and Sword and Fire crouch for employment"  SHAKSPEARE  "Monsters both"Such was the cause of quarrel between the Houses of York and Lancaster and of too many others with which the page of History reproaches the reason of man  "Oh polish'd perturbationgolden care"  SHAKSPEARE  "The brave Bernois"Henry the Fourth of France It may be said of this monarch that had all the French sovereigns resembled him despotism would have lost its horrors yet he had considerable failings and his greatest virtues may be chiefly imputed to his education in the School of Adversity  "Delug'd as with an inland sea the vales"From the heavy and incessant rains during the last campaign the armies were often compelled to march for many miles through marshes overflowed suffering the extremities of cold and fatigue The peasants frequently misled them and after having passed these inundations at the hazard of their lives they were sometimes under the necessity of crossing them a second and a third time their evening quarters after such a day of exertion were often in a wood without shelter and their repast instead of bread unripe corn without any other preparation than being mashed into a sort of paste  "The prey of dark suspicion and regret"It is remarkable that notwithstanding the excessive hardships to which the army of the Emigrants was exposed very few in it suffered from disease till they began to retreat then it was that despondence consigned to the most miserable death many brave men who deserved a better fate and then despair impelled some to suicide while others fell by mutual wounds unable to survive disappointment and humiliation  "Right onward"  MILTON Sonnet d  "I gave to misery all I had
