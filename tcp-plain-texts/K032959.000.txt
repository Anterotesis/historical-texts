 AN AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE Of the Loss of the DODDINGTON INDIAMAN And of the Adventures of those on board who survived the Shipwreck from the Journal of one of the surviving Officers  London  Printed and sold at  BAILEY's Printing  and  Register Office  at the  Ship  and  Crown  in  Leadenhallstreet  Where those who want honest Servants may be immediately Supply'd  AN AUTHENTIC NARRITIVE Of the Loss of the DODDINGTON INDIAMAN  c c  _THE Deddington Capt Samson failed from the Downs on the d of April in Company with the Pelham the Houghton the Streatham and the Edgecourt all in the Service of the East India Company and in about seven Days got clear of the Channel during this Time C pt Samson perceived that his Ship failed faster than any of the others and  e was unwilling to lose the Advantage of this Superiority by keeping them Company He therefore stood on alone and having very soon lost Sight of them he made Bonavista one of the Cape de Verde Islands lat North on the th of May and on the he got into Porto Prior Bay It now app  ared either that he had been mistaken in supposing  his Ship to out sail the rest of the Fleet or that he had lost Time by the Course he steered for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two Hours before him The Houghton arrived soon afterwards but the Edgecourt did not come till the th  On the th of May the Doddington Pelham Streath am and Houghton having taken in their Water proceeded on the Voyage together leaving the Edgecourt in the Road they continued in Company steering S by E S E till the th when Capt Samson thinking the Course too far easterly ordered the Doddington to be kept South which again separeted her from the rest of the Fleet and after a fine Voyage of seveWeeks she made the Land of the Cape of Good Hope Having just doubled the Cape a new Departure was taken from de Agulhas on the th of July and the Vessel having steered Eastward about Hours between the Latitude of d m and d the Captain ordered her to be kept E N E  In this Course she continued till about a Quarter before One in the Morning of Thursday July when she struck The Officer from whose Journal this Account is taken was then asleep in his Cabin but being suddenly awaked from the Shock he started up in the utmost Consternation and made all the hast he could to get upon Deck here all the Terrors of his Situation rushed upon him at once he saw the Men dashed to and fro by the Violence of the Sea that rolled over them and the Ship breaking to Pieces at every Stroke of the Surge he crawled over with great Difficulty to the larboard Side of the Quarterdeck which lay the highest out of Water and there he found the Captain who said very little more than they must all perish in a few Minutes a Sea parted them and he saw him no more He made shift to get back to the Quarterdeck but he was very much bruised and the small Bone of his Left Arm was broken all the rest of the Ship was under Water and  shattered to Pieces In this dreadful Situation expecting every Moment to be swallowed up he heard somebody cry out Land Upon this he looked eagerly about him but tho he saw something which he supposed was taken for Land he believed it to be only the Range of the Sea on the other Side of the Breakers at the same Moment the Sea broke over him with great Violence and not only forced him from his Hold but stun  ed him by a violent Blow upon his Eye tho' from this Time he lay insensible 'till after Day light yet he continued upon the Wreck and when he recovered he found himself made fast to a Plank by a Nail that had been forced into his Shoulder besides the Pain that he felt from his Wounds and Bruises he was now so benumbed with Cold that he could scarce move either hand or foot he called out as loud as he could and was heard by the People on the Rocks▪ but they could give him no Assistance so that it was a considerable Time before he could disengage himself and crawl on Shore  This Shore was a barren uninhabitod Rock in the Lat of d m South and distant about Leagues East of the Cape of Good Hope Here were now met Mr Evan Jones Chief Mate Mr Jobn Collet d Mr William Webb d and Mr S Powel th Mate Richard Topping Carpenter Neal Bothwell and Nathaniel Chisholm Quarter Masters Daniel Ladova the Captain's Steward Henry Sharp the Surgeon's Servant Thomas Arnold a Black and John Mackdowal Servants to the Captain Robert Beaseley John King Gilbert Chain Terence Mole Jonas Rosenbury John GlassTaylor and Hendri  Scantz Seamen John Yets Midshipmen and John Lister Ralph Smith and Edward Dysoy Matrosses These Persons being in Number were all that remained of Souls that were on board when the Ship struck  Their first Care was to search among the Things which had been thrown upon the Rocks from the Ship for something to  cover them in which they succeeded beyond their Hopes The next Thing they felt the Want of was Fire and this was not so easily supplied some of them attempted to kindle two Piecee of Wood by rubbing them together but wirhout Success others went peeping about among the Rocks to pick up fomething that might serve for a Flint and Steel after long Search they sound a Box that contained two Gun Flints and a broken File this was a joyful Acquisition but still they had nothing that would kindle from a Spark and till something like Tinder could be procured the Flint and Steel were useless a farther Search was therefore undertaken with inexpressible Sollitude and Anxiety a Cask of Gunpowder was at last discovered but to their great Disappointment it proved to be wet however upon a a near Examination a small Quantity was sound at the Bottom of the Ca  k which had suffered no Damage some of this they bruised on a Linnen Rag which served them very well sor Tinder and a Fire was soon made the bruised and wounded gathered about it and the rest went in Search of other Necesseries without which the Rock could afford them but a short Respite from Destruction In the Afternoon a Box of Wax C  ndles and a Case of Brandy were brought in both were extremely welcome especially the Brandy of which every one thought it adviseable to take a Dram soon after some others of the Party returned with an Account that they had discovered a Cask full almost of fresh Water which was yet of more Consequence than the Brandy and Mr Jones brought in some Piece of Salt Po  k and soon after others arrived driving before them seven Hogs which had come on Shore alive some Casks of Beer Water and Flour were also seen at a Distance But it was not then possible to get them over the Rocks the Approach of Night made it necessary to provide some Shelter all Hands therefore were employ'd to make a Tent of some Canv  s that had been thrown on Shore which was at last effected though it was so small for want of more Sail Cloth that it would not hold them all The Island was much frequented by a kind of Waterf  ul  something larger than a Duck called a Gannet and the h  ghest Part of it was covered with their Durg upon this Part they were obliged to build their Tent for fear of being overflowed and they placed those who could not walk under the Tent and kindled a Fire near them but as they had passed the Day without Food they passed the Night without Rest besides that they were sunk a Foot in the Fowl's Dung the Night was so tempestious that the Wind blew away their Fire and before it could be scraped together again the Rain put it out  In the Morning which was Friday July the th those that were able went again about the Rock to see what could be saved from the Wreck but to their great Mortification they found all the Casks which they had seen the Night before except one of Beer and one of Flour staved to Pieces against the Rocks soon after these were secured the Tide flowed up and put a Stop to the Work of that Day The Company therefore was called together to eat their first Meal and some Rashers of Pork were broiled upon the Coals for Dinner  The sitting down thus desolare and forlorn to a Repast which they used to share in the convivial Charfulness which naturally arose from the consciousness of present Plenty and the Hope of future struck them them with such a Sense of their Condition that they burst into passionate Lamentations wringing their Hands and looking round then with all the Wildnss of Despair in such Tumult of Mind our Thoughts hurry from one Object to another to fix if possible upon something that may afford Comfort and one of the Company recollecting that as the Carpenter was among them they might build a Sloop if they could procure Materials and Tools mentioned this as a Subject of Hope to the rest every Man's Attention was immediately turned upon the Carpenter who declared that he had no doubt but he should be able to build a Sloop that would carry them all to some Port of Safety if Tools and Materials could be found at that Time  indeed they had no rational Prospect of procuring either any more than or being able to vic  al a Sloop if they had had one ready built yet they had no soorer placed their Deliverance oneremove beyond total Imp  ssibility than they seemed to think it neither Improbable nor Difficult they began to eat without farther repining and from that Moment the Boat engrossed their whole Conversation and they not only debated upon the Size and Manner of Rigging her but to what Port they should steer her whether the Cape or Delegoa  As soon as they had finished their Repair some went in search of Tools and others to mend the Tent no Tools however were found that Day  Saturday July  They secured four Butts of Water one Cask of Flower one Hogshead of Brandy and one of their little Boats which had been thrown up by the Tide in a shattered Condition but they found no Tools except a Scraper  Sunday July  They had the good Fortune to find a Hamper in which there were Files Sailneedles Gimblets and an Azimuth Compas Card They also found two Quadrants a CarPenter's Adze a Chissel and three Swordblades and a Chest of Treasurer This search was made very early in the Morning as there had been a prodigious Surf rolling in all the Day before by which it was reasonable to suppose something would be thrown up At Ten o'Clock they all assembled to Prayers and did not go out again till after Dinner when they found most of the Packets of Letters belonging to the King and the Company these they carefully dried and laid by  The same Day as they were searching about the Beach they found the Boly of a Gentlewoman which they knew to be that of Mrs Collet the Wife of their second Ma  e who was then of a little  from the Spot The mutual Affection of this  Couple was remara  bly tender and Mr Jones the first Mare immediately stepped aside to Mr Collet and found means to take him to the other side of the Rock while the other two Mates the Carpenter and some others dug a Grave in the Bird's Dung in which they deposited the Body reading over it the Burial Service from a French Prayer Book which had driven ashore with her from the Wreck Having thus paid the Deb  of Humanity to the Dead and concealed from Mr Collet a Sight which would most sensibly if not fatally have affected him they found means after some Days to disclose to him by degrees what they had done and to give him the Weddingring which they had taken from her Finger He received it with great Emotion and afterwards spent many Days in raising a Monument over the Grave by piling up the squarest S  ones he could find on the  op of which he fixed an E  m  lank and inscribed it with her Name her Age the Time of her Death and some Account as the fatal Accident by which it was occasioned  On Monday July they secured some more Water and Pork and found some Timber Plank Cordage and Canvas These they secured with great joy for the Boat though as yet they were in want of many Implements without which it was impossible for the Carpenter to work He had just finished a Saw but he had neither Hammer nor Nails It happened however that one of the Seamen Hendrick Scantz a Sweed having picked up an old Pair of Bellows brought them to his Companions and told them that he had been by Profession a Smith and that with these Bellows and a Forge which he hoped they would be able by his Direction to build he could furnish the Carpenter with all the  ools he would want Nails included as plenty of Iron might be obtained by burning the Timber which had come on Shore from the Wreck This Acc  unt was received with a Transport of Joy the Smith immediately applied himself to mend the Bellows and the three following Days  were spent in building a Te  t and a Forge in bringing together the Timber and Plank for the Carpenter's use who was also busy in getting ready the few Tools he had that he might Begin the Boat as soon as possible  Thursday  July  The Carpenter assisted by Chesho  m the QuarterMaster began to work upon the Keel of the Boat▪ which they had determined should be a Sloop Feet long and is wide This Day also the Smith finished his Forge and laid in a Quan  ty of Fir for F  wel From this Time the Carpenter and Smith contineed to work with indefatigable Illigence except when they were prevented by the Weather the Smith having furtunately found the Ring and not of a Power Anchor which served him for an Anvil supply'd Chessels Axes Hammers Nails as they wanted and the Carpenter  fed them with great Dexterity and Dispatch till the  when he fell sick  As the Lives of the whole Company depended upon the Carpen  ▪ they wa  ched his Recovery with the utmost Impatience and Anxiety and to their unspeakable Joy he was so far recovered on the d of August as to return to his Work  In the mean Time the Stores which they had saved from the W  eck were so near exhau  ted that they came to an Allowance of two  of Brea  a Man per Day and had no sal  Pork except wh  t they were determined to keep to victual their  Water also fell short In this  they had recourse to several Expedients they dug a Well in hopes to and a Spring  but were disappointed they attempted to knock down some of the Games that  e  ed on the Top of the Rock and in the they had some Success but they found the Flesh very rank of a Fistly Taste and as black as a Shoe They also  a  or Floa  called a Ca  amara  on which  to go out a  with such Hooks and Line  an had come ashore They killed also some Seals but all those who eat of them were sick  When they were driven to great Distress they killed a  but they had generally Succeess in Fishing on a  they sometimes seet out two at a Time It happened  ever that Mr Colle  the second Mate and Mr  Midshipman were very near being driven out to Sea on one of these Floats where they would inevitably have  the th of August they had been Fishing all the  till about four o'Clock when they weighed and  to come in again but the Wind suddenly fresh  ning up to the Westward they found that instead of gaining ahed they drove out very fast The People on Shore perceived their Distress but knew not how to assist them at last however they sent out another Float with Killick  and Ropes which hoped would enable them to ride till the Wind became more moderate but the Surf was so great that it overfel her three Times and the Men were obliged to swim ba  k In the mean time they saw their Friends still driving out to Sea at a great Rate and were just giving them up to inevitable Destruction when the Carpenter sent them Word that he would make the little Boat so tight that she should not take in Water faster than one Man could lave it out This gave them fresh hope and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their Friends The Carpenter dispatched the Boat in about a Quarter of an Hour and she soon overtook the Float and took Collet and Yets on Board They soon found however that the Water gained very sast upon them notwithstanding their utmost Efforts and when she came in she was so full of Water that in a few Minutes she must have sunk  As they were now afraid of venturing any more on the Rest the Carpenter went again to wo  k on the little Boat and put her into compleat Repair Their  in fishing  was very uncertain sometimes they took great Quantities and sometimes they took none Nor was the Supplies they obtained on Shore less pr  carious the Gannets would sometimes settle in amazing Num  ers like a Cloud and sometimes they would totally disappear for several Days together This made them very desirous of finding some way to preserve the  ood they caught from Putrefactaion that they might lay by the Surplus of a fortunate Day to serve them when neither Gannets nor Fish were to be caught They made several Attempts to eure both their Fish and their Fowl by smoak  ng it but without Success They then attempted to make Salt but this had like to have been fatal to them all The Smith had mended a Copper Vessel for the Experiment and they immediately began to work without knowing that their Process in Salt making would dissolve the Surface of the Copper into Verdigreese and that this Solution or Rust of Copper was Poison Salt however was produced but the Quality that made it poisonous happened to abound in such a Degree as to make it intolerably offensive to the Taste it was therefore thrown away but those who had ventured to palate it were seized with violent Cholicks cold Sweats and Reachings which suffi  i  ntly convinced them of the Danger they had escaped  Wednesday Sept  They had now been  nhabitants of thi  desolate Rock ever since the th of July near seven Weeks and during this Time they had often seen a great Smoke on the main Land which made them very desirous to send the Boat to try what Assistance might be obtained from thence On this Day therefore Bothwell Rosenbury and Taylor set out on the Discovery and at Night the People on shore made a large Fire on the highest Part of the Rock as a Signal to them  While they were waiting the Return of the Boat they were  t  rown into the utmost Consternation by an Accident which happened to the Carpenter  who unfortunately cut his Leg  with an Adze in such a manner that he was in great Danger of Bleeding to Death they having no Surgeon among them nor any Thing proper to apply to the Wound At length however tho' with much Difficulty the Blood was staunched and the Wound healed without any bad Symptom supervening  Saturday Sept  The Weather having been fair for Hours they impatiently expected the Return of the Boat At Moon they became very uneasy at having seen nothing of her but just as they were sitting down to Dinner they were agreeably surprised by two of their People who came running over the Rocks crying  ut  the Boat the Boat  They all started up overjoyed at the Sound and ran to see her come in with great Hopes that she had succeded but they soon distingushed that she was rowed only by one Man who plied both Oars They concluded therefore that the other two were lost or detained but presently they saw another get up from the Boottom of the Boat where it was supposed he had lain down for some short Refreshment and then the Boat came forward somewhat faster though still at a slow Rate The Dinner was now entirely forgot and after they had waited an Hour on the Beach with the ut  ost Impatience the Boat came in The two Men were Rosenbury and Taylor who the Moment they stept on Shore threw themselves on their Knees and in a short but earnest Ejaculation returned Thanks to God for having once more set them safe upon this Place which barren and desolate as it was they now considered as an Asylum from a Situation of much greater Distress Having exerted their utmost Effort to bring the Boat in their Strength foreook them at once and they wer  not able to rise from the Ground without Assistance  As soon as they were g  t over to the Tent by the Assistance of the rest every Body was busy to procure them some Refreshment for they found that the Boat was quite bare of provisions  and Water They dressed them some Fish with as much haste as they could and perceiveing that they were quite exhausted with Watching and Labour they left them when they had eaten their Meat without asking any Questions and they immediately fell asleep The Behaviour of these honest Sailors to their Messmates was an uncommon Instance of hearty Kindness and generous Selfdenial the Impatience of their Curiosity must have been both encreased and justified in Proportion as they were interested in the Account that was to gratify it yet even this Curiosity in which Life itself was concerned they had the kindness and the Fortitude to repress rather than delay the Refreshment of others for its Gratification  The Account which was given by the two Adventurers when they awoke was to this Effect  About three o'Clock on the Day they set out they got round a Point about six Leagues East of the Rock  as they approached it had the App  arance of a double Point which encouraged them to hope that between the two Points they should find▪ Harbour but in this hope they were diasppointed for they  ound a large Surf all along the Coast However about Fiv  o'Clock having seen only one of the Natives they ventured  to pull in for Shore but the Moment they got into the Surf the Boat overset By this Accident  oo  Bothwell was drowned and the other two who reached the Shore in an exhausted and seeble Condition were left destitute of every kind of Provision except a small Keg of Brandy As soon as they had a little recovered their Strength they crawled along the Shore to seek for the Boat having no other hope of shelter from the wild Beasts which might be expected to come abroad in the Night After some Search they found her but they were too weak to get her up and Darkness coming on they were obliged to lie down upon the Sand with no other Covering than the Branches of a Tree and in this Condition they passed the Night As soon as the Morning dawned they went again to look for the Boat which the Surf had driven from where they left her As they walked along the Coast they saw a Man and advanced towards him upon which he ran away into the Woods that lay near the Beach and were very thick They went on and soon after discovered the Body of their Companion Bothwell which had been dragged up the sand a considerable distance from the Water and to  n to Pieces by some wild Beast This terified them exceedingly and having found the Beat the dread of passing another Night on Shore detirmined them immediately to return They were however prevented  in the Attempt by a Fresh Gale at West and before they could put back the Boat overset with them a Second time and drove with them along Shore After much struggleing and Swimming they got once more safe on the Land but as they had now been fasting ever since Three o'Clock the Day before they were fainting with Hunger and Fateigue It happened however that they met with a Fruit resembleing an Apple which they eagerly gathered and eat without knowing either its name or its Quality By good forune it did them no harm and being somewat refreshed by their antidiluvian Repast they made shift to haul the Boat on Shore and turning it upside down they crept under it to sleep being thus very well sheltered from the Sun and secured against the wild Beasts Those who know the irresistable Power of Sleep after long Watching and excessive Labour will not conclude that their first Slumber was short because their situation was incommodious or insecure they waked however before the next Morning and peeping under the Edge of the Boat they could discern the Feet of several Creatures which by their Claws they supposed to be Tygers pass by them to and again This was a sufficient Motive to remian in their resting Place till the Morning when they looked out again and saw the Feet of a Man Upon this Discovery they came from under the Boa  to the great Astonishment of the poor  Savage and two other Men and a Boy who were at some Distance When they had got all together and were a little recovered from their Surprize they made Signs to the Sailors to go away which they endeavoured to do though they were able to move but very slowley  Before they had gone far from the Boat a considerable Number of the Natives ran down upon them with their Lances It happened that Rosenbury had picked up the Mast of the Boat and a Pistol which had been washed on Shore as he went along being thus armed when the Indians came down upon him and being besides unable to run he imprudently turned about and exerting all his Strength advanced towards them in a threatening Manner supposing that they would have been seized with a Panic and retreated into the Woods  It happended however that he was mistaken for instead of running away they surrounded him and began to whet their Lances Taylor thought it was now Time to try what could be done by Supplication he therefore threw himself on his Knees and in a piteous Tone cried out for Mercy but Rosenberry took Refuge in the Water The Savages immediately came up to Taylor and began to strip him he suffered them quierly to take his Shoes and his Shirt but when they attacked his Trowsers he made some Resiststance  and by his Gestures intreated they would not leave him quite naked upon which they thought fit to desist They then made Sings for Rosenberry to come to them who was all this while swimming about in the Sea but he refused and made Signs that they would kill him They then pointed to Taylor intimating that they had not killed him Upon this he came forward and having first thrown them his Pistol and all his Cloaths but his Shirt he ventured to put himself into their Hands When he came up they offered him no Violence only held the Boat's Mast and the Pistol to him by Way of deriding the Folly of his Attempt to fright them They seemed to be very much pleased with the Cloathes which they divided among them as far as they would go They then began to rifle the Boat and having taken all the Rope they could find and the Hook by which the Rudder hung to the Sternpost they began to knock the stern to peices for the Iron which they saw was about it Next to knocking the poor Wretches on the Head this was the worst Thing they could do and rough as they were they burst into Tears at the  njury that was offered to their Boat and intreated the Savages to desist with such Agony of Distress that they suffered the Boat to remain as they found it Encouraged by this Appearance of Placability and Kindness and urged by Hunger they asked by Sings for something to eat  this Request was also granted and having given them some Roots they again made Signs for them to depart upon which they once more launched their Boat and go  into it but the Wind blowing strong from the West they could not put off The Natives perceiving that they were willing to comply with their Desires but not able covered them with the Boat to sleep under and left them as they had sound them The next Morning the Weather being fine and the Wind easterly they launched the Boat a third Time and returned back to the Rock  From this Time till  Sunday  the th of  September  the Carpenter and Smith continued to work upon the Boat and the People were busy in getting in from Time to Time what was thrown up from the Wreck particularly Cordage and Canvas to rig the Boat and some Casks of fresh Water which they were very solicitous to keep for Sea Stores as their Escape in the Boat scarce depended less upon fresh Water than upon the Sails themselves On this Day after they had been at Prayers a Duty which was regularly and publickly performed every Sunday the Officers discovered that the Chest of Treasure had been broke open and the greater Part of it taken away and concealed It may perhaps be thought strange that People whom Danger had made religious should at the same Time be guilty of Theft but upon this Occasion it should be remembred that as soon as a Ship is lost the Sailors  lose their Pay and the Captain his Command every Distinction and Subordination that subsifled on Shipboard is at an End and whatever is cast asho  e from the Wreck is by the Sailors considered as common Property The Men therefore who thought fit secretly to take what they deemed their Share of this Treasure were not in their own Opinion guilty of Dishonesty but intended only to secure what they feared the Officers would monopolize and by this Means prevent Disputes which in their Circumstances might produce fatal Effects The Officers however when they discovered what had been done and found that nodody would own they knew any Thing about it proposed to write the Form of an Oath and administer it separately to every Individual the Officers to take it first But to this the Majority immediately objected for tho' they might not suppose they had committed a Crime by taking the Treasure they knew it would be not only immoral but impious to swear they had not taken it As the Minority were not in a Condition to support their Motion the Affair was suffered to rest without farther Enquiry or Remonstrance  On the th of October they found a Fowlingpiece this was a joyful Acquisition and though the Barrel was much bent it was soon made serviceable by the Carpenter and used with great Success in shooting the Birds which before they had no way of taking but by knocking them down with a Stick  On Friday October  II  they perceived the Gannets which had of late forsaken them to hover again about the Rock in great Numbers and were in hopes they would settle to lay their Eggs in which to their great Joy they were not disappointed for after this Time they were constantly supplied with Eggs in great Plenty till the beginning of January when the Season of laying was past  On Sunday October Mr Collet Mr Web and two others ventured out once more on the Float but the Wind springing up very fresh the Float broke loose and drove with them to the other side of the Rocks The Wind still rising and the Sea running very high it was impossible for the Boat to put out they were therefore obliged to remain all Night among the Seals on the Rocks without any Shelter or Refreshment But in this Situation how dreadful they received great Comfort from reflecting how much more dreadful it would have been if instead of being driven to the Rocks their Float had been carried out to Sea It was Noon the next Day before the Wind abated and then the Boat ventured off but as the Waves still ran high it could bring in no more than two at a time leaving the Float behind them They had now some rainy Weather which proved very acceptable as they contrived to save some of the Water for Sea Stores but they were still in great want of Bread having lived  many Days on short Allowance As a last Resource they thought of building an Oven for they had some Burrels of Flower though they had no Bre  d In this Attempt they succeeded beyond their Expectations and were able to convert their Flower into tolerable Biscuit  This Biscuit however was at length so mar extended that they were obliged to live upon a few Ounces a Day without Brandy of which only a  amll Quantity remained and this they prese  ved inavailable for the Use of the Carpenter They were also so short of Water that of this they were allowed but Half a Pint a Day  In this Condition however they happily in a great Degree preserved their Health and Vigour and on the th of February they launched their Boat and called her the  Happy Deliverance  On the th they got their little Pittance of Stores on Board and on the th they set sail from the Rock on which they had lived just seven Months and to which at parting they gave the Name of  Birds Island  When they embarked in their boat the  Happy Deliverance  at  Berd Island  they were two and twenty in number and had on board two buts and four hogsheads of water two of the hogs that had come on shore from the ship alive one firkin of  butter about ponnd of biscuit and about ten ten days salt provisions at two ounces a man per day but this was quite rotten and decayed  The joy which they felt at putting off from this dreadful seat of samine and desolation was too great to be expressed but it was of very short continuance for as soon as they got to the mouth of the little channel which led to the rock the grapnails came home and they were instantly driven on the rocks where their boat which had cost seven months incessant labour and was the foundation of all their hopes struck so often and with such violence that they were thrown into the utmost consternation and expected every moment she would be broken to pieces It was a great aggravation of their distress that no efforts of their own could at all contribute to extricate or relive them so that they could only gaze at each other and wait helpless and inactive for the moment of Destruction In this condition however it pleased him whom the winds and waves obey to relieve them a swell of the sea took the boat so favourably that it lifted her from the rock on which she was beating and carrying over her the bar left her in four fath  m calm water Here they immedately anchored to repair their damage by securing the grapnails and this was not effectually done till noon the next day  On the th of February at about one in the  afternoon they weighed and stood to the eastward in order to make the river St Lucia on the coast of Africa about leagues to the northeast of the Cape their first port In this attempt they persisted till the second of March being no less than twelve days and nights without getting one mile on their course for the currents by which their ship had been driven out of her way and which not being allowed for had produced a fatal error in their reckoning now run so strong to the westward that a fair wind instead of carrying them forward scarce enabled them to keep their ground In the mean time their provisions was very near exhausted and being at once exposed both to shipwreck and famine they determined to deliver themselves up to the course of the current which they had endeavoured in vain to stem and so get back to the Cape  On the second of March therefore they bore away to the westward but the very next day the wind which till then had been easterly blew a strong gale from the west so that the wind now counteracted the force of the current and continuing to rise all that day and the following night the next morning Thursday March it it blew a strom They now endeavoured to lie too but they shipped such heavy seas that they were in perpetual danger of being dashed to pieces and were therefore compelled to send away under  their topsail only They were thus driven before the tempe  at a great rate till the next morning about three o'clock and then the weather became fine  This course they continued till Wednesday March the th when the wind shifting to the eastward they anchored in twelve fathom water at the distance of about half a mile from the shore In the evening many of the natives came down to the waterside hallowing and making signs that they should land which they many times attempted but found it impracticable In the morning the natives appeared again repeating their signals and driving down great numbers of cattle but the poor wretches on board were still tantalized by the sight of plenty which they could not reach for no place to land could yet be  ound  On Monday the th of March they determined at all events to make an attempt to get the sloop into river having waited therefore  it was high water they sent the little boat to sound ahead and following her at a proper distance they at length ventured over the bar and having happily received no damage they anchored in two fathom and a half of water  The natives had now come again to the shore and the people on board got together some brass  uttons  small bits of iron nails and copper hoops as the most likely commodities to exchange for mutton and beef The copper hoops they bent into bracelets to be worn on the legs and arms such as are worn by all the natives of this coast who have trafficked with Europeans and are called Bangles With these baubles which are prized by these poor savages prehaps with as much reason as gems and gold are prized by those who hold their simplicity in contempt the poor fa  ished adventurers hastened on shore and having soon made the natives understand what they wanted and what return they would make two nll  cks each weighing about    lb weight were driven down to the beach with great expedition and bartered for about one pound weight of copder hooks and four brass buttons Provisions of all kinds were procured in great plenty at the same rate particularly milk and a small grain that resembled Guinea wheat This grain they attempted to bake into into biscuit for sea stores but could not succeed however they found an excellent expedient by boiling it wich their meat which answered the same purpose as bread and made very good food  They continued on shore at this place near a fortnight and found the natives an honest open ha  mless and friendly people ready to do any kind office that in their power and always dividing what they brought from the chase tho' it was ever so little as far as it would go with looks and gestures that strongly expressed that  pleasure which no selfish gratification can produce Their manner of living and appearance were the same that have been so often described by those who have accounts of the people called Hottentots who inhabit the Cape of Good Hope except that as these had not been used to any commerce with Europeans they were more innocent benevolent and sincere It is however remarkable that among these people who are all black and woolly haired there was a youth of about or years who was quite white and had regular European features with fine light hair The people of the sloop observed that he was treated as a servant being sent on errands and sometimes not permitted to eat till the rest had done They also took notice that he disappeared a few days before they left the coast and therefore they suspected the natives were afraid they should carry him off with them nor was one of the natives themselves to be seen the morning they went away  On Monday March    having laid in great plenty of provisions they got safe over the bar and made sail for the river St Lucia where they arrived on Tuesday the th of April having found the current more favourable than before and no other occurrence having happened that was worth relating  Having got into the river and anchored in three  fathom water they went on shore but they found the people very different from those with whom they last traded When the brass buttons and bits of old iron were offered them they refused them and taking up some of the sand from the beach they poured it out of one hand into the other by which they might perhaps intend to intimate that they wanted strong lipuors tho' the sloop's people did not understand it and if they had thep had no strong liquors for them They made signs also that they wanted some brass rings big enough to serve as collars but in this too their visitants were equally unable to gratify them  Among other things howiver which they offered to barter was a brass handle of a chest and a peice of the  they had made eh  ir colours of These happened to be acceptable and were purchased with two large ballocks and six good fowls They also vouchsafed to purchase some of the brass bottons with pumpkins potatoes and other herbs and fruit  The natives of this part of the coast by their frepuent dealings with Europeans had learned to be cleanly in their persons and food dressing their hair up very neatly and laying aside the grease and garbage with which the others anointed and adorned themselves but at the same time they had learnt to be proud crafty deceitful  and dishonest However the adventures stayed with them till Sunday the th of April and then getting all on board they weighed and made sail  Hitherto they had been united by adversity in the bond of friendship but as they had now a near proshect of deliverance their minds were less tender and their different peculiarities of temper and opinion were indulged with less restraint As they were sailing down the river a dispute arose about the time and manner of crossing the bar which was then very near and it was carried so high that some of them hawled down the sails and lel go the grapnail close to the brake of a sand nine of them then hoisted out the little boat and went on shore swearing that they would sooner take their chance of getting to De la Goa by land than be drowned in attempting to get over the bar Those who remained in the sloop were by this accident reduced to very great distress for being prevented by the delay they had suffered from getting over the bar at high water and the wind and tide both setting out of the river at a great rate they were very soon forced on the breakers where there was then but    foot of water and the vessel drawing she must inevitably have been grounded and beaten to pieces before the river was half empty  It happened however contrary to all expectation and from some unknown cause that in less  than half an hour the surface of the water became smooth and by the vigorous efforts of those on board the vessel was brought safely out of the river  From St Luciaw hich by their reckoning is in latitude    south and longitude from London    they took a new departure and anchored in de la Goa road at    o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday the    of April having again narrowly escaped shipwr  ck on some breakers the night before  Here they found the Rose galley Captain Chandler trading for beef and ivory and most of them begged a passage with him to Bombay  After they had contunied here about three weeks three of the nine men who had deserted them at St Lucia were brought up the river in a small boat of the country and reported that the other six were waiting without any covering but a shirt and of drawers onthe other side of the bay of Delagoa waiting for a boat to bring them over  On board the sloop there was among other things the remainder of the chest of treasure belonging to the EastIndia company when had been b  oke open upon the rock and plundered of what the sailors thought their share of it upon a supposition that on the loss of the ship it was become  common proprity The officers who had secured the remainder for the company and who till now had no means of recovering the rest told Capt Chandler what had happened and having consulted with him what to do they enticed four or five of those who were on board the sloop on shore and two others on board the Rose galley they then took Captain Chandler's pinnace well manned and armed and went on board their sloop where they secured all the money plate and packets they could find without osserin  g any violence to the people on board or expressing the least resentment or menice concerning the emcezzlement The people however whom they left on board the sloop fearing that they might be taken into custopy weighed anchor and went away in the night  On the th of May the officers and the rest of the crew being on board the Rose galley she weighed anchor and proceeded not to Bombay as was intended but to Madagascar this voyage having become necessary to compleat her cargo beoause the natives of Delagoa having sold Capt Chandler    bead of cattle stole them all away again afterward and refusea to restore them without a newconsideratiou  The Rose galley soon after she was at sea made a sail which when they came up with proved to be the sloop which had taken in the  other six men that were lest behind at St Lucia they had been taken on board alive but three of them were  dead and two more died the next day having after their lives had been so often preserved almost to a m  r  cle  oolishly sacrified them to voluntary hardship and  igne in a fit  unreasonable per  ance and causeless disgust Two of the people onboard the sl  op being convinced that no harm was intended them came on board the Rose One of these was the corpenter to the honour of whose ingenuity be it recorded that the sloop which he built on a de  ol  te rock with the fragment of the ship  itted together with such tools as the peices of iron casually thrown on shore would supply he now fold to Capt Chandler for repees which is nearly equal to sterling money From this time the sloop pursued her voyage in company with the galley and both arrived at Madagascar after a pleasant voyago of two and twenty days  Soon after they had anchored at Madagascar they had the pleasure to see the Carnarvan Capt Hu  chinson arrived there in his voyage from London to China and as the treasure and packets which had been preserved from the Doddington were to be delivered at Madras the officers went with them on board the Carnarvan and delivered them with other private effects to the company's agents there on the st of August  FINIS
