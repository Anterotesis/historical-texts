 A TOUR IN SCOTLAND MDCCLXIX  TROS TYRIUSQUE  mihi nullo discrimine agetur  CHESTER PRINTED BY JOHN MONK MDCCLXXI  TO Sir ROGER MOSTYN Bart OF MOSTYN FLINTSHIRE  DEAR SIR  A Gentleman well known to the political world in the beginning of the present century made the tour of  Europe  and before he reached  Abbeville  discovered that in order to see a country to best advantage it was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night  I cannot help making this applicable to myself who after publishing three volumes of the  Zoology  of GREAT BRITAIN found out that to  be able to speak with more precision of the subjects I treated of it was far more prudent to visit the whole than part of my country struck therefore with the reflection of having never seen SCOTLAND I instantly ordered my baggage to be got ready and in a reasonable time found myself on the banks of the  Tweed  As soon as I communicated to you my resolution with your accustomed friendship you wished to hear from me I could give but a partial performance of my promise the attention of a traveller being so much taken up as to leave very little room for the discharge of epistolary duties and I flatter myself you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more satisfactory than the hasty accounts I could send you on my road but this is far from being the sole motive of this address  I have irresistable inducements of public and of a private nature to you I owe a most free enjoyment of the little territories Providence had bestowed on me for by a liberal and equal cession of fields and meads and woods you connected all the divided parts and gave a full scope to all my improvements Every view I take from my window reminds me of my debt and forbids my silence causing the pleasing glow of gratitude to diffuse itself over the whole frame instead of forcing up the imbittering sigh of  Oh si angulus ille  Now every scene I enjoy receives new charms for I mingle with the visible beauties the more pleasing idea of owing them to you the worthy neighbor and firm friend who are happy in the calm and domestic paths of life with abilities superior to oftentation and  goodness content with its own reward with a sound judgement and honest heart you worthily discharge the senatorial trust reposed in you whose unprejudiced vote aids to still the madness of the People or aims to check the presumption of the Minister My happiness in being from your earliest life your neighbor makes me confident in my observation your increasing and discerning band of friends discovers and confirms the justice of it may the reasons that attract and bind us to you ever remain is the most gratefull wish that can be thought of by  DEAR SIR  Your obliged and affectionate Friend  Thomas Pennant  DOWNING

CHESTER  CHESTER  a city without parallel for the singular structure of the four principal streets which are as if excavated out of the earth and sunk many feet beneath the surface the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens on a line with ranges of shops over which on each side of the streets passengers walk from end to end in covered galleries secure from wet or heat The back courts of all these houses are level with the ground but to go into any of these four streets it is necessary to descend a flight of several steps  The  Cathedral  is an antient structure very ragged on the outside from the nature of the red friable stone  Saxum arenarium friabile rubrum  Da Costa fossils  I  with which it is built the tabernacle work in the choir is very neat but the beauty and elegant simplicity of a very antique gothic chapterhouse is what merits a visit from every traveller  The  Hypocaust  near the  Feathers  Inn is one of the remains of the  Romans  This city was the  Deva  and  Devana  of  Antonine  and the station of the  Legia vicessima victrix  it being well known that this place was a principal station Among  many antiquities found here none is more singular than the rude sculpture of the  Dea Armigera Minerva  with her bird and her altar on the face of a rock in a small field near the  Welch  end of the bridge  The castle is a decaying pile The walk of the city the only complete specimens of antient fortifications are kept in excellent order being the principal walk of the inhabitants the views from the several parts are very fine the mountains of  Flintshire  the hills of  Broxton  and the insulated rock of  Beeston  form the ruder part of the scenery a rich flat forms the softer view and the prospect up the river towards  Boughton  recalls in some degree the idea of the  Thames  and  Richmond  hill  Passed thro'  Tarvin  a small village in the churchyard is an epitaph in memory of Mr  John Thomasen  an excellent penman but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the  Greek  character  Delamere  which  Leland  calls a faire and large forest with plenty of redde deer and falow is now a black and dreary waste it feeds a few rabbets and a few black  Terns  Br Zool  II  skim over the splashes that water some part of it  A few miles from this heath lies  Northwich  Salt Pi  s  a small town long famous for its rock salt and brine pits some years ago I visited one of the mines the stratum of salt lies about forty yards thick that which I saw was hollowed into the form of a temple I descended thro' a dome and found the roof supported by rows of pillars about two  yards thick and several in height the whole was illuminated with numbers of candles and made a most magnificent and glittering appearance Above the salt is a bed of whitish clay  Argilla caerulacinerea  Da Costa fossils  I  used in making the  Liverpool  earthenware and in the same place is also dug a good deal of the  Gypsum  or plaister stone The fossil salt is generally yellow and semipellucid sometimes debased with a dull greenish earth and is often found but in small quantities quite clear and colorless  The road from this place to  Macclesfield  is thro' a flat rich but unpleasant country That town is in a very flourishing state is possessed of a great manufacture of mohair and twist buttons has between twenty and thirty silk mills and a very considerable copper smelting house and brass work  After leaving this place the country almost instantly changes and becomes very mountanous and barren at left on the surface but the bowels compensate for the external sterility by yielding sufficient quantity of coal for the use of the neighboring parts of  Cheshire  and for the burning of lime vast quantity is made near  Buxton  and being carried to all parts for the purposes of agriculture is become a considerable article of commerce  The celebrated warm bath of BUXTON  The  Romans  who were remarkably fond of warm baths did not overlook these agreeable waters they had a bath inclosed with a brick wall adjacent to the present St  Anne  's well which Dr  Short  in his essay on mineral waters says was razed in  is seated in a bottom  BUXTON  amidst these hills in a most chearless spot and would be little frequented did not  Hygeia  often reside here and dispense to her  votaries the chief blessings of life ease and health with joy and gratitude I this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of the waters I recollect with rapture the return of spirits the flight of pain and reanimation of my long long crippled rheumatic limbs But how unfortunate is it that what Providence designed for the general good should be rendered only a partial one and denied to all except the opulent or I may say to the comparatively few that can get admittance into the house where these waters are imprisoned There are other springs  Cambden  says nine very near that in the  Hall  and in all probability of equal virtue I was informed that the late Duke of  Devonshire  not long before his death had ordered some of these to be inclosed and formed into baths It is to be hoped that his successor will not fail adopting so usefull and humane a plan that he will form it on the most enlarged system that they may open not solely to these whom misused wealth hath rendered invalids but to the poor cripple whom honest labor hath made a burden to himself and his country and to the soldier and sailor who by hard service have lost the use ot those very limbs which once were active in our defence The honor resulting from such a foundation would be as great as the satisfaction arising from a consciousness of so benevolent a work would be unspeakable the charms of dissipation would then lose their force and dull and tasteless would every human luxury appear to him who had it in his power thus to lay open these fountains of health and to be able to exult in such pathetic and comfortable strains as these  When the ear heard me  then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me  Because I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy  I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame  After leaving  Buxton  passed thro'  Middleton  dale a deep narrow chasm between two vast cliffs which extend on each side near a mile in length this road is very singular but the rocks in general are too naked to be beautifull At the end is the small village of  Stoney Middleton  here the prospect opens and at  Barsly Bridge  exhibits a pretty view of a small but fertile vale watered by the  Derwent  and terminated by  Chatsworth  and its plantations Arrived and lay at  Chesterfield  an ugly town There is here a great manufacture of worsted stockings and another of a brown earthenware much of which is sent into  Holland  the clay is found near the town over the bass or cherry  Or flinty  stratum above the coal The steeple of  Chesterfield  church is a spire covered with lead but by a violent wind strangely bent in which state it remains  In the road side about three miles from the town  JUNE  are several pits of iron stone about nine or ten feet deep The stratum lies above the coal and is two feet thick I was informed that the adventurers pay ten pounds per annum to the Lord of the Soil for liberty of raising it that the laborers  borers have six shillings per load for getting it each load is about twenty strikes or bushels which yields a tun of metal Coal in these parts is very cheap a tun and a half being sold for five shillings  Changed horses at  Worksop  and  Tuxford  crossed the  Trent  at  DunhamFerry  where it is broad but shallow the spring tides flow here and rise about two feet but the common tides never reach this place Pass along the  FossDyke  or the canal opened by  Henry  I  Dugdale  on embanking  to form a communication between the  Trent  and the  Witham  it was opened  I make use of this word as Doctor  Stukely  conjectures this canal to have been originally a  Roman  work and that another of the same kind called the  Cardike  communicated with it by means of the  Withan  which began a little below  Washenbro'  three miles from  Lincoln  and was continued thro' the fens as far as  Peterborough  The gentlemen who favored me with the account of the  Cardike  referred me to  Stukely  's  Cerausius  and his life of  Richard  of  Cirencester  books I have not at present before me  the year and extends from  Lincoln  to  Torkesey  its length is eleven miles three quarters the breadth between dike and dike at the top is about sixty feet at bottom twentytwo vessels from fifteen to thirtyfive tuns navigate this canal and by its means a considerable trade in coals timber corn and wool is carried on In former times the persons who had landed property on either side were obliged to scower it whenever it was choaked up and accordingly we find presentments were made by juries in several succeeding reigns for that purpose Reach  LINCON an antient but illbuilt city much fallen away from its former extent It lies partly on a plain partly on a very steep hill on whose summit are the cathedral and the ruins of the castle The first  is a vast pile of gothic architecture has nothing remarkable on the outside but within is of matchless beauty and magnificence the ornaments are excessively rich and in the finest gothic taste the pillars light the centre losty and of a surprising grandeur The windows at the N and S ends very antient but very elegant one represents a leaf with its fibres the other consists of a number of small circles There are two other antient windows on each side the great isle the others as I recollect are modern This church was till of late years much out of repair but has just been restored in a manner that does credit to the Chapter There is indeed a sort of arch near the W end that seems placed there for the same end as  Bayes  tells us he wrote one of his scenes meerly to set off the rest  The prospect from this eminence is very extensive but very barren of objects a vast flat as far as the eye can reach consisting of plains not the most fertile or of fens  The fens naked as they now appear were once well wooded oaks have been found buried in them which were sixteen yards long and five in circumference fir trees from thirty to thirtyfive yards long and a foot or eighteen inches square These trees had not the mark of the ax but appeared as if burnt down by fire applied to their lower parts Acorns and small nuts have also been found in great quantities in the same places  Dugdale  on embanking  and moors the last are far less extensive than they were many being drained and will soon become the best land in the country But still much remains to be done the fens near  RevesbyAbby  eight miles beyond  Horncastle  are of vast extent but serve for little other purpose than the rearing great numbers of geese which are the wealth of the fenmen  During the breeding season  Geese  these birds are lodged in the same houses with the inhabitants and even in their very bedchambers in every appartment are three rows of coarse wicker pens placed one above another each bird has its separate lodge divided from the other which it keeps possession of during the time of sitting A person called a  Gozzard  i e Gooseherd  attends the flock and twice a day drives the whole to water then brings them back to their habitations helping those that live in the upper stories to their nests without ever misplacing a single bird  The geese are plucked five times in the year the first plucking is at  LadyDay  for feathers and quils and the same is renewed for feathers only four times more between that and  Michaelmas  The old geese submit quietly to the operation but the young ones are very noisy and unruly I once saw this performed and observed that goslins of six weeks old were not spared for their tails were plucked as I was told to habituate them early to what they were to come to If the season proves cold numbers of geese die by this barbarous custom  It was also practised by the antients  Candidorum alterum vec  gal Velluntar quibusdam loc  his anno  Plinii lib x c    Vast numbers are drove annually to  London  to supply the markets among them all the superannuated geese and ganders called here  Cagmags  which serve to fatigue the jaws of the good Citizens who are so unfortunate as to meet with them  The fen called the  West Fen  Fen birds  is the place where the Ruffs and Reeves resort to in the greatest numbers  Br Zool  II  Suppl tab  xv  p    and many other sorts of water fowl which do not require the shelter of reeds or rushes migrate here to breed for this fen is very bare having been imperfectly drained by narrow canals which intersect it for great numbers of miles These the inhabitants navigate in most diminutive shallow boats they are in fact the roads of the country  The  East Fen  is quite in a state of nature and gives a specimen of the country before the introduction of drainage it is a vast tract of morass intermixed with numbers of lakes from half a mile to two or three miles in circuit communicating with each other by narrow reedy straits they are very shallow none are above four or five feet in depth but abound with fish such as Pike Pearch Ruff Bream Tench Rud Dace Roach Burbolt Sticklebacks and Eels The fen is covered with reeds the harvest of the neighboring inhabitants who mow them annually for they prove a much better thatch than straw and not only cottages but many very good houses are covered with them Stares which during winter resort in myriads to roost in the reeds are very destructive by breaking them down by the vast numbers that perch on them The people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive them away and are at great expence in powder to free themselves from these troublesome guests I have seen a stock of reeds harvested and stacked worth two or three  hundred pounds which was the property of a single farmer  The birds which inhabit the different fens are verv numerous I never met with a finer field for the Zoologist to range in Besides the common Wildduck of which an account is given in another place  Br Zool  II In general to avoid repetition the reader is  err'd to the four  Octavo  volumes of  British  Zoology for a more particular account of  mentioned in this Tour  wild Geese Garganies Pochards Shovelers and Teals breed here I have seen on the  East Fen  a small flock of the tusted Ducks but they seemed to make it only a baiting place The Pewit Gulls and black Terns abound the last in vast flocks almost deafen one with their clamors a few of the great Terns or Tickets are seen among them I saw several of the great crested Grebes on the  East Fen  called there  Gaunts  and met with one of their floating nests with eggs in it The lesser crested Grobe the black and dusky Grebe and the little Grebe are also inhabitants of the fens together with Coots Waterhens spotted Waterhens Waterrails Ruffs Redshanks Lapwings or Wipes Redbreasted Godwits and Whimbrels The Godwits breed near  Weshenbrough  the Whimbrels only appear for about a fortnight in  May  near  Spalding  and then quit the country Opposite to  Fossdyke Wash  during summer are great numbers of  Avosettas  called there  Yelpers  from their cry they hover over the sportsman's head like the Lapwing and fly with their necks and legs extended  Knots are taken in nets along the shores near  Foss  yke  in great numbers during winter but they disappear in the spring  The shorteared owl  Br Zool  I visits the neighborhood of  Washenbrough  along with the Woodcocks and probably performs its migrations with those birds for it is observed to quit the country at the same time I have also received specimens of them from the  Danish  dominions one of the retreats of the Woodcock This owl is not observed in this county to perch on trees but conceals itself in long old grass if disturbed takes a short flight lights again and keeps staring about during which time its horns are very visible The farmers are fond of the arrival of these birds as they clear the fields of mice and will even fly in search of prey during day provided the weather is cloudy and misty  But the greatest curiosity in these parts is the vast Herony at  CressiHall  Heronry  six miles from  Spalding  The Herons resort there in  February  to repair their nests settle there in the spring to breed and quit the place during winter They are numerous as Rooks and their nests so crouded together that myself and the company that was with me counted not fewer than eighty in one tree I here had opportunity of detecting my own mistake and that of other Ornithologists in making two species of Herons for I found that the crested Heron was only the male of the other it made a most beautifull appearance with its snowy neck and long crest streaming with the wind The family who owned this place was of the same name with these birds which seems to be the principal inducement for preserving them  In the time of  Michael Drayton Here stalk'd the stately crane at though he march'd in war  But at present this bird is quite unknown in our island but every other species enumerated by that observant Poet still are found in this fenny tract or its neighborhood  Visited  Spalding  JUNE  Spalding  a place very much resembling in form neatness and situation a  Dutch  town the river  Welland  passes through one of the streets a canal is cut through another and trees are planted on each side The church is a handsome structure the steeple a spire The churches in general throughout this low tract are very handsome all are built of stone which must have been brought from places very remote along temporary canals for in many instances the quarries lie at lest twenty miles distant But these aedifices were built in zealous ages when the benedictions or maledictions of the church made the people conquer every difficulty that might obstruct these pious foundations The abby of  Crowland  seated in the midst of a snaking fen is a curious monument of the insuperable zeal of the times it was erected in as the beautifull tower of  Boston  church visible from all parts is a magnificent specimen of a fine gothic taste  Passed near the site of  SwinesheadAbby  JUNE  SwinesheadAbby  of which there are not the lest remains In the walls of a farm house built out of the ruins you are shewen the figure of a Knight Templar and told it was the monk who poisoned King  John  a fact denied by our best historians  Returned thro'  Lincoln  went out of town under the  NewportGate  a curious  Roman  work passed over part of the heath changed horses at  Spittle  and at  GlanfordBridge  dined at the ferryhouse on the banks of the  Humber  and after a passage of about five miles with a brisk gale landed at  Hull  and reached that night  BurtonConstable  the seat of Mr  Constable  in that part of  Yorkshire  called  Holderness  a dull flat country but excellent for producing large cattle and a good breed of horses whose prices are near doubled since the  French  have grown so fond of the  English  kind  Made an excursion to  Hornsea  a small town on the coast remarkable only for its mere a piece of water about two miles long and one broad famous for its pike and eels it is divided from the sea by a very narrow bank so is in much danger of being sometime or other lost  The cliffs on the coast of  Holderness  are high and composed of clay which falls down in vast fragments Quantity of amber is washed out of it by the tides  Amber  which the country people pick up and fell it is found sometimes in large masses but I never saw any so pure and clear as that from the  Baltic  It is usually of a pale yellow color within and prettily clouded the outside covered with a thin coarse coat  After riding about twentytwo miles thro' a flat grazing country  JULY  reached  BurlingtonQuay  a small town close to the sea There is a design of building a pier for the protection of shipping at present there is only a large wooden quay which projects into the water from which the place takes its  name From hence is a fine view of the white cliffs of  Flamborough  Head which extends far to the East and forms one side of the  Gabrantuicorum sinus portuosus  of  Ptolomy  a name derived from the  British Gysr  on account of the number of goats found there according to the conjecture of  Cambden  A mile from hence is the town of  Burlington  The body of the church is large but the steeple by some accident has been destroyed near it is a large gateway with a noble gothic arch possibly the remains of a priory of black canons founded by  Walter de Gant  in the beginning of the reign of  Henry  I  This coast of the kingdom is very unfavourable to trees for except some woods in the neighborhood of  BurtonConstable  there is a vast nakedness from the  Humber  as far as the extremity of  Caithness  with a very few exceptions which shall be noted in their proper places  Went to  Flamborough  Head  JULY  FlamboroughHead  The town is on the North side consists of about one hundred and fifty small houses entirely inhabited by fishermen few of whom as is said die in their beds but meet their fate in the element they are so conversant in Put myself under the direction of  William Camidge  Ciceroni of the place who conducted me to a little creek at that time covered with fish a fleet of cobles having just put in Went in one of those little boats to view the  Head  coasting it for upwards of two miles The cliffs are of a tremendous height and amazing grandeur beneath are several vast caverns some closed at the end  others are pervious formed with a natural arch giving a romantic passage to the boat different from that we entered In some places the rocks are insulated are of a pyramidal figure and soar up to a vast height the bases of most are solid but in some pierced thro' and arched the color of all these rocks is white from the dung of the innumerable flocks of migratory birds  Its birds  which quite cover the face of them filling every little projection every little hole that will give them leave to rest multitudes were swimming about others swarmed in the air and almost stunned us with the variety of their croaks and screams I observed among them corvorants shags in small flocks guillemots a few black guillemots very shy and wild auks pussins kittiwakes  Called here  Petrels Br Zool Suppl tab  xxiii  p    and herring gulls Landed at the same place but before our return to  Flamborough  visited  Robin Leith  's hole a vast cavern to which there is a narrow passage from the land side it suddenly rises to a great height the roof is finely arched and the bottom is for a considerable way formed in broad steps resembling a great but easy ftaircase the mouth opens to the sea and gives light to the whole  Lay at  Hunmandby  a small village above  Filey Bay  round which are some plantations that thrive tolerably well and ought to be an encouragement to gentlemen to attempt covering these naked hills  Filey Brig  is a ledge of rocks running far into the sea and often fatal to shipping The bay is sandy and affords vast quantities of fine fish such  as Turbot Soles c which during summer approach the shore and are easily taken in a common sesne or draggingnet  Set out for  Scarborough  JULY  passed near the site of  Flixton  a hospital founded in the time of  Athelstan  to give shelter to travellers from the  wolves that they should not be devoured by them  Cambden Brit  II  so that in those days this bare tract must have been covered with wood for those ravenous animals ever inhabit large forests These  hospitia  are not unfrequent among the  Alps  are either appendages to religious houses or supported by voluntary subscriptions On the spot where  Flixton  stood is a farmhouse to this day called the  Spital  House Reach  SCARBOROUGH a large town built in form of a crescent on the sides of a deep hill at one extremity are the ruins of the castle seated on a cliff of a stupendous height from whence is a very good view of the town In the castleyard is a handsome barrack for one hundred and fifty men but at present untenanted by soldiery Beneath on the south side is a large stone pier another is now building which shelters the shipping belonging to the town It is a place absolutely without trade yet owns above sail of ships which are hired out for freight in the late war the Government had never less than of them in pay  The number of inhabitants belonging to this place are above but as great part are sailors nothing like that number are resident which makes one church sufficient for those who live on shore It is large and seated almost on  the top of the hill The range of buildings on the  Cliff  commands a fine view of the castle town and shore and of innumerable shipping that are perpetually passing backward and forward on their voyages The spaw  The waters are impregnated with a purgative salt  Glauber  's a small quantity of common salt and of steel There are two wells the ferthest from the town is more purgative and its taste more bitter the other is more chalybeate and ita taste more brisk and pungent D H  lies at the foot of one of the hills S of the town this and the great conveniency of seabathing occasion a vast resort of company during summer it is at that time a place of great gayety for with numbers health is the pretence but dissipation the end  The shore is a fine hard sand and during low water is the place where the company amuse themselves with riding This is also the fish market for every day the cobles or little fishing boats are drawn on shore here and lie in rows often quite loaden with variety of the best fish There was a fisherman on the th of  May  brought in at one time Cods Lings Skates Holibuts besides a vast quantity of lesser fish and sold the whole for l s It is superfluous to repeat what has been before mentioned of the methods of fishing being amply described  Vol  III p of the  British Zoology  yet it will be far from impertinent to point out the peculiar advantages of these seas and the additional benefit this town might  experience by the augmentation of its fisheries For this account and for numberless civilities I think myself much indebted to Mr  Travis  furgeon who communicated to me the following Remarks  Scarborough  is situated at the bottom of a bay formed by  Whitby  rock on the North and  Flamborough  head on the South the town is seated directly opposite to the centre of the W end of the  Dogger  bank which end according to  Hammond  's chart of the North Sea lies S and by W and N and by E but by a line drawn from  Tinmouth  castle would lead about N W and S E Tho' the  Dogger  bank is therefore but leagues from  Flamborough  head yet it is and a half from  Scarborough  from  Whitby  and from  Tinmouth  castle The N side of the bank stretches off E N E between and leagues untill it almost joins to the  LongBank  and  Jutt  's Riff  It is to be remarked that the fishermen seldom find any Cod Ling or other round fish upon the  Dogger  bank itself but on the sloping edges and hollows contiguous to it The top of the bank is covered with a barren shifting sand which affords them no subsistence and the water on it from its shallowness is continually so agitated and broken as to allow them no time to rest The flat fish do not suffer the same inconvenience there for when disturbed by the motion of the sea they shelter themselves in the sand and find variety of suitable food It is true the  Dutch  fish upon the  Dogger  bank but it is also true they take little except Soles Skates Thornbacks Plaise c It is in the hollows  between the  Dogger  and the  WellBank  that the Cod are taken which supply  London  market  The shore except at the entrance of  Scarborough  pier and some few other places is composed of covered rocks which abound with Lobsters and Crabs and many other shell fish no Oysters thence after a space covered with clean sand extending in different places from one to five or six miles The bottom all the way to the edge of the  Dogger  banks is a scar in some places very rugged rocky and cavernous in others smooth and overgrown with variety of submarine plants Mosses Corallines c  I met with on the shores near  Scarborough  small fragments of the true red coral  some parts again are spread with sand and shells others for many leagues in length with soft mud and ooze furnished by the discharge of the  Tees  and  Humber  Upon an attentive review of the whole it may be clearly inferred that the shore along the coast on the one hand with the edges of the  Dogger  bank on the other like the sides of a decoy give a direction towards our fishing grounds to the mighty shoals of Cod and other fish which are well known to come annually from the Northern ocean into our seas and secondly that the great variety of fishing grounds near  Scarborough  extending upwards of leagues from the shore afford secure retreats and plenty of proper food for all the various kinds of fish and also suitable places for each kind to deposit their spawn in  The fishery at  Scarbarough  only employs men and brings in about l per annum a  trifle to what it would produce was there a canal from thence to  Leeds  and  Manchester  it is probable it would then produce above ten times that sum employ some thousands of men give a comfortable and cheap subsistence to our manufacturers keep the markers moderately reasonable enable our manufacturing towns to underfell our rivals and prevent the hands as is too often the case raising insurrections in every year of scarcity natural or artificial  On discoursing with some very intelligent fishermen I was informed of a very singular phoenomenon they annually observe about the spawning of fish  Mr  Os  k  observed the same in  S Lat  in his return from  China  The seamen call it the flowering of the water  Vol  l  At the distance of or leagues from shore during the months of  July  and  August  it is remarked that at the depth of or fathom from the surface the water appears to be saturated with a thick jelly filled with the  Ova  of fish which reaches or fathoms deeper this is known by its adhering to the ropes the cobles anchor with when they are fishing for they find the first or fathom of rope free from spawn the next or covered with slimy matter the remainder again free to the bottom They suppose this gelatinous stuff to supply the newborn fry with food and that it is also a protection to the spawn as being disagreeable to the larger fish to swim in  There is great variety of fish brought on shore besides those described as  British  fish were two species of Rays the WhipRay has also been taken  here and another species of Weever but these are subjects more proper to be referred to a  Fauna  than an Itinerary for a minute description  Left  Scarborough  passed over large moors to  Robin Hood's Bay  JULY  On my round observed the vast mountains of alum stone  Alum Works  from which that salt is thus extracted It is first calcined in great heaps which continue burning by its own phlogiston after being well set on fire by coals for six ten or fourteen months according to the size of the heap some being equal to a small hill It is then thrown into pits and steeped in water to extract all the saline particles The liquor is then run into other pits where the vitriolic salts are precipitated by the addition of a solution of the  sal sode  prepared from kelp or by the volatile  alkali  of stale urine The superfluous water being then evaporated duely by boiling in large furnaces the liquor is set to cool and lastly is poured into large casks to crystallize  The alum works of this county are of some antiquity they were first discovered by Sir  Thomas Chaloner  in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  who observing the trees tinged with an unusual color made him suspicious of its being owing to some mineral in the neighborhood He found out that the strata abounded with an aluminous salt  At that time the  English  being strangers to the method of managing it there is a tradition that Sir  Thomas  was obliged to seduce some workmen from the  Pope  's alumworks near  Rome  then the greatest in  Europe  If one may judge from the curse which his Holiness thundered out against Sir  Thomas  and  the sugitives he certainly was not a little enraged for he cursed by the very form that  Ernulphus  Vide  Tristram Shandy  has left us and not varied a tittle from that most comprehensive of imprecations  The first pits were near  Gisborough  the seat of the  Chaloners  who still flourish there notwithstanding his Holiness's  anathema  The works were so valuable as to be deemed a royal mine Sir  Paul Pindar  who rented them payed annually to the King l to the Earl of  Mulgrave  l to Sir  William Pennyman  l kept workmen in pay and sold his alum at l per tun But this monopoly was destroyed on the death of  Charles  I and the right restored to the proprietors  In these alum rocks are frequently found  cornua ammonis  and other fossils  Jet  lodged in a stony nodule Jet is sometimes met with in thin flat pieces externally of the appearance of wood According to  Solinus Britain  was famous for this fossil  GAGATES  hic plurimus optimusque est lapis si decorem requiras nigro gemmeus si naturam aquâ ardet oleo restinguitur si potestatem attritu calefactus

seemed as if a great fish fair had been held there some were carrying off their bargains others busied in curing the fish and a little out at sea was a fleet of cobles and five men boats and others arriving to discharge the capture of the preceding  tides  From hence the fish are carried in machines to  Derby Lichfield Birmingham  and  Worcester  the towns whick lie beyond the last are supplied from the West of  England  There are of the first belonging to this little place The houses here make a grotesque appearance are scattered over the face of a steep cliff in a very strange manner and fill every projecting ledge one above another in the same manner as the peasants do in the rocky parts of  China Sand's End Runwick  and  Staitbes  three other fishingtowns on this coast are as I am told built in the same manner  The country through this day's journey was hilly the coast high Reach  WHITBY called by the  Saxons Streaneshalch  or bay of the lighthouse a large town oddly situated between two hills with a narrow channel running through the middle extending about a mile farther up the vale where it widens and forms a bay The two parts of the town are joined by a good drawbridge for the conveniency of letting the shipping pass From this bridge are often taken the viviparous Blenny whose backbone is as green as that of the Sea Needle The river that forms this harbor is the  Esk  but its waters are very inconsiderable when the tide is out Here is a pretty brisk trade in shipbuilding but except that a small manufacture of sailcloth and the hiring out of ships as at  Scarborough  like that town it has scarce any commerce It is computed there are about ships belonging to this place Of late an attempt has been made to have a share in the  Greenland  fishery four ships were sent out and had very good success There are very good dry  docks towards the end of the harbor and at the mouth a most beautifull pier At this place is the first salmonfishery on the coast  On the hill above the S side of the town is a fine ruin of St  Hilda  's church  St  Hilda  's church  The site was given to that saint by  Oswy  king of  Northumberland  about A D possibly in consequence of a vow he made to found half a dozen monasteries and make his daughter a nun should heaven favor his arms St  Hilda  founded a convent here for men and women dedicated it to St  Peter  and put it under the direction of an abbess This establishment was ruined by the excursions of the  Danes  but after the conquest it was rebuilt and filled with  Benedictines  by  Walter de Percy  In less enlightened times it was believed that not a wild goose dared to fly over this holy ground and if it ventured was sure to fall precipitate and perish in the attempt  Went about two miles along the shore then turned up into the country a black and barren moor observed on the right a vast artificial mount or  Tumulus  called  Freeburgh  Hill a monument in all probability the work of the  Danes  whose custom it was to fling up such  Tumuli  over the graves of their kings or leaders or in memory of the flain in general upon the spot where they had obtained any great victory It is possible that this mount owed its rise to the victory gained by  Ivar  a  Danish  prince over  Ella  king of  Bernicia  who was on his way from the North to succour  Osbert  for we are told that  Ivar  after defeating the last went from  York  to meet  Ella  and fought and flew him on his march  At the end of this moor about three miles from  Gisborough  is a beautifull view over the remaining part of  Yorkshire  towards  Durham Hartlepool  and the mouth of the  Tees  which maeanders through a very rich tract The country instantly assumes a new face the road lies between most delightfull hills finely wooded and the little vales between them very fertile on some of the hills are the marks of the first alum works which were discovered by Sir  Thomas Chaloner  GISBOROUGH a small town pleasantly situated in a vale  GISBOROUGH  surrounded at some distance by hills and open on the east to the sea which is about five miles distant It is certainly a delightfull spot but I cannot see the reason why  Cambden  compares it to  Puteoli  Here was once a priory of the canons of the order of St  Austin  founded by  Robert de Brus  after the dissolution granted by  Edward  VI to the  Chaloners  a very beautifull east window of the church is still remaining The town has at present a good manufacture of sail cloth  The country continues very fine quite to the banks of the  Tees  a considerable river which divides  Yorkshire  from the bishoprick of  Durham  After travelling miles in a strait line through the first enter  Durham  crossing the river on a very handsome bridge of arches the battlements neatly panneled with stone and reach  STOCKTON lying on the  Tees  in form of a crescent A handsome town the principal street is remarkably fine being feet broad and several lesser streets run into it at right angles In the middle of the great street are neat shambles a townhouse  and large assemblyroom There is besides a large square About a century ago according to  Anderson  it had scarce a house that was not made of clay and thatch but is now a flourishing place Its manufacture is sail cloth and great quantities of corn and lead from the mineral parts of the county are sent off from hence by commission As the river does not admit of large vessels so high as the town those commodities are sent down to be shipped  The salmon fishery here is neglected for none are taken beyond what is necessary to supply the country Smelts come up the river in the winter time On the west side of the town stood the castle what remained of it is at present converted into a barn The country from hence to  Durham  is flat very fertile and much inclosed Towards the west is a fine view of the highlands of the country those hills are part of that vast ridge which commence in the north and deeply divide this portion of the kingdom and on that account are called by  Cambden  the  Appennines  of  England  The approach to DURHAM is romantic  DURHAM  through a deep hollow cloathed on each side with wood The city is pretty large but the buildings old Part are on a plain part on the side of a hill The abby or cathedral and the castle where the Bishop lives when he resides here are on the summit of a cliff whose foot is washed on two sides by the river  Were  The walks on rhe opposite banks are very beautifull flagged in the middle and paved on the sides and are well kept They are cut through  the wood impend over the river and receive a venerable improvement from the castle and antient cathedral which soar above  The last is very old  Begun in by Bishop  William de Carilepho  plain without and supported within by massy pillars deeply engraved with lozengelike figures and zigzag furrows others are plain and each forms a cluster of pillars The skreen to the choir is wood covered with a coarse carving The choir neat but without ornament  The chapterhouse seems very antient and is in the form of a theatre The cloisters large and handsome All the monuments are defaced except that of Bishop  Hatfield  The Prebendal houses are very pleasantly situated and have a fine view backwards  There are two handsome bridges over the  Were  to the walks and a third covered with houses which join the two parts of the town This river produces Salmon Trout Roach Dace Minow Loche Bullhead Sticklebacks Lamprey the lesser Lamprey Eels Smelts and Samlet which are called here  Rackriders  because they appear in winter or bad weather  Rack  in the northern dialect signifying the driving of the clouds by tempests It is observed here that before they go off to spawn those fish are covered with a white slime  There is no inconsiderable manufacture at  Durham  of shalloons tammies stripes and callamancoes I had heard on my road many complaints of the ecclesiastical government this county is subject  to but from the general face of the country it seems to thrive wonderfully under them  Saw  Coker  JULY  the seat of Mr  Car  a most romantic situation layed out with great judgment the walks are very extensive principally along the sides or at the bottom of deep dells bounded with vast precipices finely wooded and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines which I was told bore well but late The river  Were  winds along the hollows and forms two very fine reaches at the place where you enter these walks Its waters are very clear and its bottom a solid rock The view towards the ruins of  Finchal  Abby is remarkably great and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent solemnity a fit retreat for its monastic inhabitants This was once called the Desert and was the rude scene of the austerities of St  Godric  who carried them to the most senseless extravagance  St  Godric  was born at  Walpole  in  Norfolk  and being an itinerant merchant got acquainted with St  Cuthbtert  at  Farn Island  He made three pilgrimages to  Jerusalem  at length was warned by a vision to settle in the desert of  Finchal  He lived a hermetical life there during years and practised unheard of austerities he wore an iron shirt next his skin day and night and wore out three he mingled ashes with the flower he made his bread of and least it should then be too good kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it In winter as well as summer he passed whole nights up to his chin in water at his devotions Like St  Antony  he was often haunted by fiends in various shapes sometimes in form of beautifull damsels so was visited with evil concupiscence which he cured by rolling naked among thorns and briars his body grew ulcerated but to encrease his pain he poured salt into the wounds Wrought many miracles and died  Britannia sacra  About ten years after his decease a  Benedictine  priory of thirteen monks was founded there in his honor by  Hugh Pudsey  Bishop of  Durham  A sober mind may even at present be affected with horror at the prospect from the summits of the cliffs into a darksome and stupendous chasm rendered still more  tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its distant bottom  Passed through  ChesterleStreet  a small town near which is  LumlyCastle  the seat of the Earl of  Scarborough  a place as I was told very well worth seeing but unfortunately it proved a public day and I lost sight of it The country from  Durham  to  Newcastle  was very beautifull the risings gentle and prettily wooded and the views agreeable that on the borders remarkably fine there being from an eminence not far from the capital of  Northumberland  an extensive view of a rich country watered by the coaly  Tyne  Reach  NEWCASTLE a large disagreeable and dirty town  NEWCASTLE  divided in two unequal parts by the river and both sides very steep The lower parts are inhabited by Keelmen and their families a mutinous race for which reason this town is always garrisoned  The great business of the place is the coal trade The collieries lie at different distances from five to eighteen miles from the river and the coal is brought down in waggons along rail roads and discharged from covered buildings at the edge of the water into the keels or boats that are to convey it on shipboard These boats are strong clumsy and round will carry about tuns each sometimes are navigated with a square sail but generally are pushed along with large poles No ships of large burthen can come up as high as  Newcastle  but are obliged to lie at  Shields  a few miles down the river where stage coaches go thrice every day for the conveniency of passengers This country is most  remarkably populous  Newcastle  alone contains near inhabitants and there are at lest sail of ships belonging to that town and its port The effect of the vast commerce of this place is very apparent for many miles round the country is finely cultivated and bears a most thriving and opulent aspect  JULY  Left  Newcastle  the country in general flat passed by a large stone column with three dials on the capital with several scripture texts on the sides called here  Pigg  's Folly from the founder  A few miles further is  Stannington  Bridge a pleasant village  Morpeth  a small town with a neat townhouse and a tower for the bell near it The castle was on a small eminence but the remains are now very inconsiderable Some attempt was made a few years ago to introduce the  Manchester  manufacture but without success There is a remarkable story of this place that the inhabitants reduced their own town to ashes on the approach of King  John  A D out of pure hatred to their monarch in order that he might not find any shelter there  This place gave birth to  William Turner  as Dr  Fuller  expresses it an excellent  Latinist Graecian Oratour  and  Poet  he might have added polemic divine champion and sufferer in the protestant cause physician and naturalist His botanic writings are among the first we had and certainly the best of them and his criticisms on the birds of  Aristotle  and  Pliny  are very judicious He was the first who flung any light on those subjects in our  island therefore clames from a naturalist this tribute to his memory  He was born in the reign of  Henry  VIII died in    Felton  a pleasant village on the  Coquet  which some few miles lower discharges itself into the sea opposite to a small isle of the same name remarkable for the multitudes of waterfowl which resort there to breed  At  Alnwick  Alnwick  Castle  a small town the traveller is disappointed with the situation and environs of the castle the residence of the  Percies  the antient Earls of  Northumberland  You look in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feudal age for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry for halls hung with helms and haberks or with the spoils of the chace for extensive forests and venerable oaks You look in vain for the  helmet  on the tower the antient signal of hospitality to the traveller or for the greyheaded porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment The numerous train whose countenances gave welcome to him on his way are now no more and instead of the disinterested usher of the old times he is attended by a  valet  eager to receive the fees of admittance  There is vast grandeur in the appearance of the outside of the castle the towers magnificent but injured by the numbers of rude statues crouded on the battlements The appartments are large and lately finished in the gothic style with a most incompatible elegance The gardens are equally inconsistent trim to the highest degree and more adapted  to a  villa  near  London  than the antient seat of a great Baron In a word nothing except the numbers of unindustrious poor that swarm at the gate excites any one idea of its former circumstances  A stage further is  Belford  the seat of  Abraham Dixon  Esq  a modern house the front has a most beautifull simplicity in it The grounds improved as far as the art of husbandry can reach the plantations large and flourishing a new and neat town instead of the former wretched cottages and an industrious race instead of an idle poor at present fill the estate  On an eminence on the sea coast  Bamborough  Castle  about four miles from  Belford  is the very antient castle of  Bamborough  built by  Ida  first king of the  Northumbrians  A D But according to the conjecture of an antiquarian I met with there on the site of a  Roman  fortress It was also his opinion that the square tower was actually the work of the  Romans  It had been of great strength the hill it is founded on excessively steep on all sides and accessible only by flights of steps on the south east The ruins are still considerable the remains of a great hall are very singular it had been warmed by two fireplaces of a vast size and from the top of every window ran a flue like that of a chimney which reached the summits of the battlements Many of the ruins are now filled with sand caught up by the winds that rage here with great impetuosity and carried to very distant places  This castle and the manour belonging to it was once the property of the  Forsters  but purchased  by Lord  Crew  Bishop of  Durham  Bishop  Crew  's Charity  and with other considerable estates left vested in Trustees to be applied to unconfined charitable uses Three of these Trustees are a majority one of them makes this place his residence and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's generous bequest He has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower the part reserved for himself and family is a large hall and a few smaller apartments but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of The upper part is an ample grainary from whence corn is dispenced to the poor without distinction even in the dearest time at the rate of four shillings a bushel and the distressed for many miles round often experience the conveniency of this benefaction  Other apartments are fitted up for the reception of shipwrecked sailors and bedding is provided for about thirty should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time A constant patrole is kept every stormy night along this tempestuous coast for above eight miles the length of the manour by which means numbers of lives have been preserved Many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility but by timely relief are soon brought to themselves  It often happens that ships strike in such a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief in case numbers of people could be suddenly assembled for that purpose a cannon  Once belonging to a  Dutch  frigate of guns which with all the crew was lost opposite to the castle about sixty years ago  is fixed on the top of  the tower which is fired once if the accident happens in such a quarter twice if in another and thrice if in such a place By these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to and by this means frequently preserve not only the crew but even the vessel for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perillous situation  In a word all the schemes of this worthy Trustee have a humane and useful tendency he seemed as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as  Spenser  tells us the first of his seven  Beadsmen  in the house of  holinesse  was  The first of them that eldest was and best  Of all the house had charge and governement  As guardian and steward of the rest  His office was to give entertainement  And lodging unto all that came and went  Not unto such as could him feast againe  And doubly quite for that he on them spent  But such as want of harbour did constraine  Those for GOD's sake his dewty was to entertaine  Opposite to  Bamborough  lie the  Farn  islands  Farn  Isles  which form two groupes of little isles and rocks to the number of seventeen but at low water the points of others appear above the surface they all are distinguished by particular names The nearest isle to the shore is that called the  House Island  which lies exactly one mile chains from the coast the most distant is about seven or eight miles They are rented for l  per annum  their produce is kelp some few feathers and a few seals which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins Some of them yeild a  Eider Drake and Duck  little grass and serve to feed a cow or two which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats  Visited these islands in a coble a safe but seemingly hazardous species of boat  JULY  long narrow and flatbottomed which is capable of going thro' a high sea dancing like a cork on the summits of the waves  Touched at the rock called the  Meg  whitened with the dung of corvorants which almost covered it their nests were large made of tang and most excessively faetid  Rowed next to the  Pinnacles  an island in the farthest groupe so called from some vast columnar rocks at the south end even at their sides and flat at their tops and entirely covered with guillemots and shags the fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board which they place from top to top forming a narrow bridge over such a horrid gap that the very fight of it strikes one with horror  Landed at a small island where we found the female  Eider  ducks  Vide  Br Zool  II I have been informed that they also breed on  InchColm  in the  Firth  of  Forth  at that time sitting  Eider Ducks  the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded in some were three in others five eggs of a large size and pale olive color as smooth and glossy as if varnished over The nests are built on the beach among the loose pebbles not far from the water The  Ducks sit very close nor will they rise till you almost tread on them The Drakes separate themselves from the females during the breeding season We robbed a few of their nests of the down and after carefully separating it from the tang found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat The people of this country call these St  Cuthbert  's ducks from the saint of the islands  Besides these birds I observed the following  Puffins called here  Tom Noddies  Auks here  Skouts  Guillemots  Black Guillemot  Little Auks  Shielducks  Shags  Corvorants  Black and white Gulls  Brown and white Gulls  Herring Gulls which I was told fed sometimes on eggs of other birds  Common Gull here  Annets  Kittiwakes or Tarrocks  Pewit Gulls  Great Terns  Sea Pies  Sea Larks here  Brokets  Jackdaws which breed in rabbetholes  Rock Pigeons  Rock Larks  The Terns were so numerous that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs  The last isle I visited was the  House island  the sequestered spot where St  Cuthbert  passed the two last years of his life Here was afterwards established a priory of  Benedictines  for six or eight Monks subordinate to  Durham  A square tower the remains of a church and some other buildings are to be seen there still and a stone coffin which it is pretended was that of St  Cuthbert  At the north end of the isle is a deep chasm from the top to the bottom of the rock communicating to the sea through which in tempestuous weather the water is forced with vast violence and noise and forms a fine  jet d'eau  of sixtysix feet high it is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast the  Churn  Reached shore through a most turbulent rippling occasioned by the fierce current of the tides between the islands and the coast  Pursued my journey northward Saw at a distance the  Cheviot  hills  JULY  on which I was informed the green Plovers breed and that during winter flocks innumerable of the great Bramblings or Snowflakes appear the most southern place of their migration in large companies  The country almost woodless there being but one wood of any consequence between  Belford  and  Berwick  Saw on the left an antient tower which shewed the character of the times when it was unhappily necessary on these borders for every house to be a fortress  On the right had a view of the sea and not remote from the land of  Lindesfarn  or  Holy  Island once an episcopal seat afterwards translated to  Durham  On it are the ruins of a castle and a church In some parts are abundance of  Entrochi  which are called by the country people St  Cuthbert  's beads  After a few miles riding have a full view of  Berwick  and the river  Tweed  winding westward for a considerable way up the country but its banks were without any particular charms  I was informed that the beautifull banks of the  Tweed  verify the old fong at the passage at  Colstream  being almost woodless The river is broad and has over it a bridge of sixteen very handsome arches eipecially two next the town  BERWICK is fortified in the modern way but is much contracted in its extent to what it was formerly the old castle and works now lying at some distance beyond the present ramparts The barracks are large consist of a center and two wings The church was built by  Cromwel  and according to the spirit of the builder without a steeple Even in  Northumberland  towards the borders the steeples grew less and less and as if it were forewarned the traveller that he was speedily to take leave of episcopacy The townhouse has a large and handsome modern tower to it the streets in general are narrow and bad except that in which the townhouse stands  Abundance of wool is exported from this town eggs in vast abundance collected through all the  country almost as far as  Carlisle  they are packed in boxes with the thick end downwards and are sent to  London  for the use of sugar refiners I was told that as many are exported as bring in annually the sum of fourteen thousand pounds  The salmon fisheries here are very considerable  Salmon fishery  and likewise bring in vast sums they lie on each side the river and are all private property except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of  Durham  which in rent and tythe of fish brings in l  per ann  for all the other fisheries are liable to tythe The common rents of those are l a year for which the tenants have as much shore as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore the limits of each are staked and I observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neighbor's limits One man goes off in a small flatbottomed boat square at one end and taking as large a circuit as his net admits brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary where others assist in landing it The best fishery is on the south side  For a fuller account of this fishery vide  British Zoology  III l to it may be also added that in the middle of the river not a mile west of the town is a large stone on which a man is placed to observe what is called the  reck  of the salmon coming up  very fine salmon trout are often taken here which come up to spawn from the sea and return in the same manner as the salmon do The chief import is timber from  Norway  and the  Baltic  Almost

raise the siege of that town A cruel action blasted the laurels of the conqueror  Seton  the governor stipulated to surrender in fifteen days if not relieved in that time and gave his son as hostage for performance The time elapsed  Seton  refused to execute the agreement and with a  Roman  unfeelingness beheld the unhappy youth hung before the walls  The entrance into  Scotland  has a very unpromising look for it wanted for some miles the cultivation of the parts more distant from  England  but the borders were necessarily neglected for till the accession of  James  VI and even long after the national enmity was kept up and the borderers of both countries discouraged from improvement by the barbarous inroads of each nation This inattention to agriculture continued till lately but on reaching the small village of  Eytown  the scene was greatly altered the wretched cottages or rather hovels of the country were vanishing good comfortable houses arise in their stead the lands are inclosing and yield very good barley oats and clover the banks are planting I speak in the present tense for there is still a mixture of the  old negligence left amidst the recent improvements which look like the works of a new colony in a wretched impoverished country  Soon after the country relapses no arable land is seen but for four or five miles succeeds the black joyless heathy moor of  Coldingham  happily  Coldingham  this is the whole specimen that remains of the many miles which not many years ago were in the same dreary unprofitable state Near this was the convent of that name immortalized by the heroism of its Nuns who to preserve themselves inviolate from the  Danes  cut off their lips and noses and thus rendering themselves objects of horror were with their abbess  Ebba  A D  burnt in the monastery by the disappointed savages  At the end of the moor came at once in sight of the  Firth  Bodotria  of  Tacitus  who describes the two Firths of  Clyde  and  Forth  and the intervening Isthmus with much propriety speaking of the fourth summer  Agricola  had passed in  Britain  and how conconvenient he found this narrow tract for shutting out the enemy by his fortresses says  Nam  Glota Firth of  Clyde    et  Bodotria  diversi maris astu per immensum revecti anguslo terrarum spatio dirimuntur  Vit Agr  of  Forth  a most extensive prospect of that great arm of the sea

Old Cambus  at a mean house in a poor village where I believe the Lord of the soil is often execrated by the weary traveller for not enabling the tenant to furnish more comfortable accommodations in so considerable a thoroughfare  The country becomes now extremely fine bounded at a distance on one side by hills on the other by the sea the intervening space is as rich a tract of corn land as I ever saw for  East Lothian  is the  Northamptonshire  of  North Britain  the land is in many places manured with sea tang but I was informed that the barley produced from it is much lighter than barley from other manure  On the side of the hills on the left is Sir  John Hall  's of  Dunglas  a fine situation with beautifull plantations Pass by  Broxmouth  a large house of the  Duke  of  Roxborough  in a low spot with great woods surrounding it Reach  DUNBAR  DUNBAR  the chief street broad and handsome the houses built of stone as is the case with most of the towns in  Scotland  There are some ships sent annually from this place to  Greenland  and the exports of corn are pretty considerable The harbour is safe but small its entrance narrow and bounded by two rocks Between the harbour and the castle is a very surprising stratum of stone  Columnar rocks  in some respects resembling that of  Giant's Causeway  in  Ireland  it consists of great columns of a red grit stone either triangular quadrangular pentangular or hexangular their diameter from one to two feet their length at low water thirty dipping or inclining a little to the south  They are jointed but not so regularly or so plainly as those that form the  Giant's Causeway  The surface of several that had been torn off appear as a pavement of numbers of convex ends probably answering to the concave bottoms of other joints once incumbent on them The space between the  columns was filled with thin septa of red and white fparry matter and veins of the same pervaded the columns transversely This range of columns faces the north with a point to the east and extends in front about two hundred yards The breadth is inconsiderable the rest of the rock degenerates into shapeless masses of the same fort of stone irregularly divided by thick septa This rock is called by the people of  Dunbar  the  Isle  Opposite are the ruins of the castle seated on a rock above the sea underneath one part is a vast cavern composed of a black and red stone which gives it a most infernal appearance a fit representation of the pit of  Acheron  and wanted only to be peopled with witches to make the scene complete it appears to have been the dungeon there being a formed passage from above where the poor prisoners might have been let down according to the barbarous custom of war in early days There are in some parts where the rock did not close the remains of walls for the openings are only natural fissures but the founders of the castle taking advantage of this cavity adding a little art to it rendered it a most complete and secure prison  On the other side are two natural arches through which the tide flowed under one was a fragment of wall where there seems to have been a portal for the admission of men or provisions from sea thro' which it is probable that  Alexander Ramsay  in a stormy night reinforced the garrison in spite of the fleet which lay before the place when closely besieged by the  English  in and galantly defended  for nineteen weeks by that heroine  black Agnes  Countess of  March  Buchanan lib  ix  c  The  English  were obliged to desist from their enterprize    Through one

height on the south side the top appears of a conic shape but the other overhangs the sea in a most tremendous manner The castle which was once the state prison of  Scotland  is now neglected it lies close to the edge of the precipice facing the little village of  Castleton  where I toke boat in order to visit this singular spot but the weather proved unfavorable the wind blew so fresh and the waves ran so high that it was impossible to attempt landing for even in calmer weather it cannot be done without hazard there being a steep rock to ascend and commonly a great swell which often

singular bird as it has been very fully treated of in the second volume of the  British Zoology  With much difficulty landed at  North Berwick  three miles distant from  Castleton  the place we intended to return to The first is a small town pleafantly seated near a high conic hill partly planted with trees it is seen at a great distance and is called the  Law  of  Berwick  a name given to several other high hills in this part of the island  Pass through  Abberladie  and  Preston Pans  Preston Pans  the last takes its name from its saltpans there being a considerable work of that article also another of vitriol Saw at a small distance the field of battle or rather of carnage known by the name of the battle of  Preston Pans  where the Rebels gave a lesson of severity which was more than retaliated the following spring at  Culloden  Observed in this day's ride I forget the spot the once princely seat of the Earl of  Wintoun  now a ruin judiciously left in that state as a proper remembrance of the sad fate of those who engage in rebellious politicks There are great marks of improvement on approaching the capital the roads good the country very populous numbers of manufactures carried on and the prospect embellished with gentlemen's seats Reach  EDINBURGH  EDINBURGH  A city that possesses a boldness and grandeur of situation beyond any that I had ever seen it is built on the edges and sides of a vast sloping rock of a great and precipitous height at the upper extremity and the sides declining very quick and steep into the plain The view of the houses at a distance strikes the traveller with wonder then own loftiness improved by their almost aerial situation gives them a look of magnificence not to be found in any other part of  Great Britain  All thefe conspicuous buildings form the upper part of the great street are of stone and make a handsome appearance they are generally six or seven stories high in front but by reafon of the declivity of the hill much higher backward one in particular  called  Babel  has about twelve or thirteen stories Every house has a common staircase and every story is the habitation of a separate family The inconvenience of this particular structure need not be mentioned notwithstanding the utmost attention in the article of cleanliness is in general observed The common complaint of the streets of  Edinburgh  is now taken away by the great vigilance of the magistrates  The streets are cleaned early every morning Once the City payed for the cleaning at present it is rented for or l per annum  and their severity against any that offend in any gross degree  In the closes or allies the inhabitants are very apt to fling out their filth c without regarding who passes but the sufferer may call everyinhabitant of the house it came from to account and make them prove the delinquent who is always punished with a heavy fine  It must be observed that this unfortunate species of architecture arose from the turbulence of the times in which it was in vogue every body was desirous of getting as near as possible to the protection of the castle the houses were crouded together and I may say piled one upon another meerly on the principle of security  The castle is antient but strong  Castle  placed on the summit of the hill at the edge of a very deep precipice Strangers are shewn a very small room in which  Mary  Queen of  Scots  was delivered of  James  VI  From this fortress is a full view of the city and its environs a strange prospect of rich country with vast rocks and mountains intermixed on the south and east are the meadows or the publick walks  Harriot  's hospital part of the town overshadowed  by the stupendous rocks of  Arthur  's seat and  Salusbury'  Craigs  the  Pentland  hills at a few miles distance and at a still greater those of  Muirfoot  whose sides are covered with verdant turf  To the north is a full view of the  Firth  of  Forth  from  Queen'sFerry  to its mouth with its southern banks covered with towns and villages On the whole the prospect is singular various and fine  Reservoir  The reservoir of water  It is conveyed in pipes from the  Pentland  hills five miles distant  for supplying the city lies in the Castlestreet and is well worth seeing the great cistern contains near two hundred and thirty tuns of water which is conveyed to the several conduits that are disposed at proper distances in the principal streets these are conveniences that few towns in  North Britain  are without  In a small square on the south side of  Highstreet  is the Parlement Close a small square in which is the ParlementHouse  Advocate's Library  where the courts of justice are held Below stairs is the Advocate's library founded by Sir  George Mackenzie  and now contains above thirty thousand volumes and several manuscripts among the more curious are the four Evangelists very legible notwithstanding it is said to be several hundred years old  St  Jerome  's Bible wrote about the year  A  Malabar  book wrote on leaves of plants  A  Turkish  manuscript illuminated in some parts like a missal  Elogium in sultan morad filium filii Soliman Turcici Script Constantinopoli Anno Hegirae    A Cartulary or records of the monasteries some very antient  A very large Bible bound in four volumes illustrated with scripture prints by the first engravers pasted in and collected at a vast expence There are besides great numbers of antiquities not commonly shewn except enquired after  The  Luckenbooth  row which contains the  Tolbooth  or city prison and the weighinghouse which brings in a revenue of l  per annum  stands in the middle of the Highstreet and with the guardhouse contributes to spoil as fine a street as most in  Europe  being in some parts eighty feet wide and finely built  The exchange is a handsome modern building in which is the customhouse the first is of no use in its proper character for the merchants always chuse standing in the open street exposed to all kinds of weather  The old cathedral is now called the New Church and is divided into four places of worship in one the Lords of the Sessions attend there is also a throne and a canopy for his Majesty should he visit this capital and another for the Lord Commissioner There is no music either in this or any other of the  Scotch  churches for  Peg  still faints at the found of an organ  The same church has a large tower oddly terminated with a sort of crown  On the front of a house in the  Nether Bow  are two fine profile heads of a man and woman  Roman  heads  of  Roman  sculpture supposed to be those of  Severus  and  Julia  but as appears from an inscription  In sudore vultus tui versceris pane  Anno These heads are well engraven in  Gordon  's Itinerary  tab  iii  made by the person who put them into the wall were mistaken for  Adam  and  Eve  Near the  Trone  church are the remains of the house once inhabited by  Mary Steuart  now a tavern  At the end of the  CannongateStreet  stands  HolyRood  palace  HolyRoad  House  originally an abby founded by  David  I in The towers on the N W side were erected by  James  V together with other buildings for a royal residence according to the editor of  Cambden  great part except the towers abovementioned were burnt by  Cromwell  but the other towers with the rest of this magnificent palace as it now stands were executed by Sir  William Bruce  by the directions of  Charles  II within is a beautifull square with piazzas on every side It contains great numbers of fine apartments some that are called the King's are in great disorder the rest are granted to several of the nobility  In the Earl of  Breadalbane  's are some excellent portraits particularly three full lengths remarkably fine by  Vandyck  of  Henry  Earl of  Holland  William  Duke of  Newcastle  Charles  Earl of  Warwick  I am informed that the portraits of the Earls of  Holland  and  Warwick  are now removed to  Taymouth    And by Sir  Peter Lely  the Duke and Dutchess of  Lauderdale  and  Edward  Earl of  Jersey  There  is besides a very good head of a boy by  Morrillio  and some views of the fine scenes near his Lordship's seat at  Taymouth  At Lord  Dunmore  's lodgings is a very large piece of  Charles  I and his Queen going to ride with the sky showering roses on them a Black holds a grey horse a boy a spaniel with several other dogs sporting round the Queen is painted with a lovelock and with browner hair and complection and younger than I ever saw her drawn It is a good piece and said to be done by  Vandyck  in the same place are two other good portraits of  Charles  II and  James  VII  The gallery of this palace takes up one side and is filled with colossal portraits of the Kings of  Scotland  In the old towers are showen the appartments where the murther of  David Rizzo  was committed  That beautifull piece of  gothic  architecture the church  Chapel  or chapel of  HolyRoodAbby  is now a ruin the roof having fell in by a most scandalous neglect notwithstanding money had been granted by Government to preserve it entire Beneath the ruins lie the bodies of  James  II and  James  V  Henry Darnly  and several persons of rank and the inscriptions on several of their tombs are preserved by  Maitland  A gentleman informed me that some years ago he had seen the remains of the bodies but in a very decayed state the beards remained on some and that the bones of  Henry Darnly  proved their owner by their great size for he was said to be seven feet high  Parks  Near this palace are the  Parks  first inclosed by  James  V within are the vast rocks  According to  Maitland  their perpendicular height is feet  known by the names of  Arthur  's Seat and  Salusbury's Craigs  their fronts exhibit a romantic and wild scene of broken rocks and vast precipices which from some points seem to overhang the lower parts of the city Great columns of stone from forty to fifty feet in length and about two feet in diameter regularly pentagonal or hexagonal hang down the face of some of these rocks almost perpendicularly or with a very slight dip and form a strange appearance Considerable quantities of stone from the quarries have been cut and sent to  London  for paving the streets its great hardness rendering it excellent for that purpose Beneath these hills are some of the most beautifull walks about  Edinburgh  commanding a fine prospect over several parts of the country  On one side of the  Park  are the ruins of St  Anthony  's chapel once the resort of numberless votaries  The south part of the city has several things worth visiting  Herriot  's Hospital  Herriot  's hospital is a fine old building much too magnificent for the end proposed that of educating poor children it was founded by  George Herriot  jeweller to  James  II who followed that monarch to  London  and made a large fortune There is a fine view of the castle and the sloping part of the city from the front the gardens were formerly the resort of the gay and there the  Scotch  Poets often laid in their comedies the scenes of intrigue  In the churchyard of the Grey Friers is the monument of Sir  George Mackensie  a rotunda with a multitude of other tombs this and another near the  Cannongate  being the only caemeteries to this populous city  The college is a mean building but no one resides in it except the Principal  College  whose house is supposed to be on the site of that in which  George Darnly  was murdered then belonging to the Provost of the  Kirk  of  Field  The students of the university are dispersed over the town and are about six hundred in number they wear no habit nor are they subject to any regulations but as they are for the most part volunteers for knowledge few of them desert her standards There are twentytwo professors of different sciences most of whom read lectures all the chairs are very ably filled those in particular which relate to the study of medicine as is evident from the number of ingenious physicians  eleves  of this university who prove the abilities of their masters The  Musaeum  had for many years been neglected but by the assiduity of the present Professor of natural history bids fair to become a most instructive repository of the  naturalia  of these kingdoms  The royal infirmary is a spatious and handsome aedifice  Infirmary  capable of containing two hundred patients The operationroom is particularly convenient the councilroom elegant with a good picture in it of Provost  Drummond  From the cupolo of this building is a fine prospect and a full view of the city  Not far from hence are twentyseven acres of ground designed for a square called  George Square  a small portion is at present built consisting of small but commodious houses in the  English  fashion Such is the spirit of emprovement that within these three years sixty thousand pounds have been expended in houses in the modern taste and twenty thousand in the old  Watson  's hospital should not be forgot a large good building behind the Grey Friers church an excellent institution for the educating and apprenticing the children of decayed merchants who after having served their time with credit receive fifty pounds to set up with  The  meadows  or public walks are well planted and are very extensive these are the mall of  Edinburgh  as  Comely Gardens  are its  Vauxhall  The  Cowgate  is a long street running parallel with the  High Street  beneath the steep southern declivity of the city and terminates in the  GrassMarket  a wide street where cattle are sold and criminals executed On several of the houses are small iron crosses which I was informed denoted that they once belonged to the Knights of St  John  On the north side of the city lies the new town which is planned with great judgement and will prove a magnificent addition to  Edinburgh  the houses in St  Andrew  's square cost from l to l each and one or two or l They are all built in the modern style and are free from the inconveniences attending the old city  These improvements are connected to the city by a very beautifull bridge whose highest arch is ninetyfive feet high  In the walk of this evening I passed by a deep and wide hollow beneath  Calton  Hill the place where those imaginary criminals witches and forcerers in less enlightened times were burnt and where at festive seasons the gay and galant held their tilts and tournaments at one of these it is said that the Earl of  Bothwell  made the first impression on the susceptible heart of  Mary Stuart  having galopped into the ring down the dangerous steeps of the adjacent hill he seemed to think that  Women born to be control'd  Stoop to the forward and the bold  These desperate feats were the humour of the times of chivalry  Brantome  relates that the  Ducde Nemours  galopped down the steps of the  Sainte Chappel  at  Paris  to the astonishment of the beholders The men cultivated every exercise that could preserve or improve their bodily strength the ladies every art that tended to improve their charms  Mary  is reported to have used a bath of white wine a custom strange but not without precedent  Jaques du Fouilloux  enraptured with a country girl enumerating the arts which she scorned to use to improve her person mentions this  Point ne portoit de ce linge semelle  Pour amoindrir son seing et sa mammelle  Vasquine nulle ou aucun pelicon  Elle ne portoit ce n'estoit sa façcon  Point ne  prenoit vin blanc pour se 'baigner  Ne drogue encore pour son corps alleger  L' Adolescence de Jaques du Fouilloux      At a small walk's distance from  Colton  Hill lies the new botanic garden  The old botanic garden lies to the east of the new bridge an account of it is to be seen in the  Museum Balfourianum  consisting of five acres of ground a greenhouse fifty feet long two temperate rooms each twelve feet and two stoves each twentyeight the ground rises to the north and defends the plants from the cold winds the soil a light sand with a black earth on the surface It is finely stocked with plants whose arrangement and cultivation do much credit to my worthy friend Dr  Hope  Professor of Botany who planned and executed the whole It was begun in being founded by the munificence of his present Majesty who granted fifteen hundred pounds for that purpose  During this week's stay at  Edinburgh  the prices of provisions were as follow  Beef from d to d  Mutton from d to d  Veal from d to d  Lamb d  Bacon d  Butter in summer d in winter s  Pigeons  per  dozen from d to s  Chickens  per  pair d to s  A fowl s d  Green goose s  Fat goose s d  Large turky s or s  Pig s  Coals d or d  per  hundred delivered  Many fine excursions may be made at a small distance from this city  Leith  a large town  LEITH  about two miles north lies on the  Firth  is a flourishing place and the port of  Edinburgh  The town is dirty and ill built and chiefly inhabited by sailors but the pier is very fine and is a muchfrequented walk The races were at this time on the sands near lowwater mark considering their vicinity to a great city and populous country the meeting was far from numerous a proof that dissipation has not generally infected the manners of the  North Britons  Craigmellar  castle is seated on a rocky eminence about two miles south of  Edinburgh  is square and has towers at each corner Some few apartments are yet inhabited but the rest of this great pile is in ruins  Newbottle  the seat of the Marquiss of  Lothian  is a pleasant ride of a few miles from the capital It was once a  Cistercian  abby founded by  David  I in but in was erected into a lordship in favor of Sir  Mark Ker  son of Sir  Walter Ker  of  Cessford  The house lies in a warm bottom and like most other of the houses of the  Scotch  nobility resembles a  French Chateau  by having a village or little paltry town adjacent The situation is very favorable to trees as appears by the vast size of those near the house and I was informed that fruit ripens here within ten days as early as at  Chelsea  The  Marquiss  possesses a most valuable collection of portraits many of them very fine and almost all very instructive a large halflength of  Henry Darnly  represents him tall aukward and gauky with a stupid insipid countenance most likely  drawn after he had lost by intemperance and debauchery those charms which captivated the heart of the amorous  Mary  A head of her mother  Marie de Guise  not less beautifull than her daughter  A head of  Madame Monpensier  and of several other illustrious persons who graced the court of  Louis  XIII  Prince  Rupert  and Prince  Maurice  in one piece Some small portraits studies of  Vandyk  among

 the residence of the celebrated poet  Drummond  Who is said to have composed his poems in one of these caves he flourished in the time of  James  VI  are as I was informed others of the same nature but of greater extent which Doctor  Stukeley  Vide  Itin Curiosum    tab    calls a  Pictish  castle These places in fact were excavated by the antient inhabitants of the country either as receptacles for their provisions or for retreats for themselves or families in time of war in the same manner as  Tacitus  relates was the custom of the  Germans  Solent et subterraneos specus aperire eosque

Buccleugh  originally the property of the  Douglases  and was when in form of a castle of great strength and during the time of the Regent  Morton  's retreat styled the  Lion's Den  The portraits at  Dalkeith  are numerous and some good among others the First Duke of  Richmond  and his Dutchess  The Dutchess of  Cleveland  Countess of  Buccleugh  mother to the Dutchess of  Monmouth  and Lady  Egglinton  her sister  The Dutchess and her two sons the Dutchess of  York  her hand remarkably fine the Dutchess of  Lenox  Mrs  Susanna Waters  mother of the Duke of  Monmouth  with his picture in

occasion of the marriage of  Monmouth  with the heiress of the house  Since this I have been informed that not far from  Dalkeith  at  Rosstyn  is a most beautifull and entire chapel of gothic architecture well worth a visit from a curious Traveller    At  Smeton  another seat of the Duke of  Buccleugh  a mile distant from the first is a fine halflength of General  Monk  looking over his

walls for hedges are not yet become universal in this part of the kingdom it is not a century since they were known here Reach the  SouthFerry  a small village on the banks of the  Firth  which suddenly is contracted to the breadth of two miles by the jutting out of the land on both shores but almost instantly widens towards the west into a fine and extensive bay The prospect on each side is very beautifull a rich country frequently diversified with towns villages castles and gentlemen's seats  Such as  Seith  castle  Dumferline  town Lord  Morris  's Lord  Hopetoun  's Captain  Dundass  's  There is beside a vast view up and down the  Firth  from its extremity not remote from  Sterling  to its mouth near  Mey  isle in all about sixty miles  This Ferry is also called  Queen'sFerry  being the passage much used  Or as others say because she her brother and sister first landed there after their escape from  William  the Conqueror  by  Margaret  queen to  Malcom  III and sister to  Edgar Etheling  her residence being at  Dumferline  Cross over in an excellent passageboat observe midway the little isle called  InchGarvey  with the ruin of a small castle An  arctic  gull flew near the boat pursued by other gulls as birds of prey are this is the species that persecutes and pursues the lesser kinds till they mute through fear when it catches up their excrements e'er they reach the water the boatmen on that account styled it the dirty  Aulin  Landed in the shire of  Fife  Part of the antient  Caledonia  at  North Ferry  Granite quarry  near which are the great granite quarries which help to supply the streets of  London  with paving stones many ships then waiting near in order to take in their lading The granite lies in great perpendicular stacks above which a reddish earth  filled with friable micaceous nodules The granite itself is very hard and is all blasted with gunpowder the cutting into shape for paving costs two shillings and eightpence per tun and the freight to  London  seven shillings  The country as far as  Kinross  is very fine consisting of gentle risings much corn especially  Bear  but few trees except about a gentleman's seat called  Blair  where there are great and flourishing plantations Near the road are the last collieries in  Scotland  except the inconsiderable works in the county of  Sutherland  Kinross  is a small town seated in a large plain bounded by mountains the houses and trees are so intermixed as to give it an agreeable appearance It has some manufactures of linnen and cutlery ware At this time was a meeting of justices on a singular occasion a vagrant had been not long before ordered to be whipped but such was the point of honor among the common people that no one could be persuaded to go to  Perth  for the executioner who lived there to press I may say two men for that service was the cause of the meeting so Mr  Boswell  Hist Corsica  may rejoice to find the notion of honor prevale in as exalted a degree among his own countrymen as among the virtuous  Corsicans  Not far from the town is the house of  Kinross  built by the famous architect Sir  William Bruce  for his own residence and was the first good house in  North Britain  it is a large elegant but plain building the hall is fiftytwo feet long the grounds about it well planted the fine lake adjacent so  that it is capable of being made as delightfull a place as any in  North Britain  LoughLeven  a magnificent piece of water very broad but irregularly indented is about twelve miles in circumference and its greatest depth about twentyfour fathoms is finely bounded by mountains on one side on the other by the plain of  Kinross  and prettily embellished with several groves most fortunately disposed Some islands are dispersed in this great expanse of water one of which is large enough to feed several head of cattle but the most remarkable is that distinguished by the captivity of  Mary Stuart  Lochleven  castle  which stands almost in the middle of the lake The castle still remains consists of a square tower a small yard with two round towers a chapel and the ruins of a building where it is said the unfortunate Princess was lodged In the square tower is a dungeon with a vaulted room above over which had been three other stories Some trees are yet remaining on this little spot probably coeval with  Mary  under whose shade she may have sat expecting her escape at length effected by the enamoured  Douglas  Historians differ in respect to the cause that influenced him to assist in his sovereign's escape some attribute it to his avarice and think he was bribed with jewels reserved by  Mary  others that he was touched by a more generous passion the last opinion is the most natural considering the charms of the Queen and the youth of her deliverer  This castle had before been a royal residence but not for captive monarchs having been granted from the crown by  Robert  III to  Douglas  Laird of  LochLeven  but had been originally a seat of the  Culdees  The fish of this lake are Pike small Perch fine Eels  Fish birds  and most excellent Trouts the best and the reddest I ever saw the largest about six pounds in weight The fishermen gave me an account of a species they called the  Gally  Trout which are only caught from  October  to  January  are split salted and dried for winter provision by the description they certainly were our Char only of a larger size than any we have in  England  or  Wales  some being two feet and a half long The birds that breed on the isles are Herring Gulls Pewit Gulls and great Terns called here  Pictarnes  Lay at a good inn a single house about half a mile North of  Kinross  Made an excursion about seven miles west  JULY Rumbling Brig  to see the  rumbling brig  at  Glendevon  a bridge of one arch slung over a chasm worn by the river  Devon  about eighty feet deep very narrow and horrible to look down the bottom in many parts is covered with fragments of rocks in others the waters are visible gushing between the stones with great violence the sides in many places project and almost lock in each other trees shoot out in various spots and contribute to encrease the gloom of the glen while the ear is filled with the cawing of daws the cooing of woodpigeons and the impetuous noise of the waters  A mile lower down is the  Cawdron Glen  here the river  Cawdron Glen  after a short fall drops on rocks hollowed in a strange manner into large and deep cylindric cavities open on one side or formed into great circular cavities like cauldrons  In  Sweden  and the North of  Germany  such holes as these are called  Giant  's Pots  Kalm's Voy  I and  Ph Trans abridg  V  from whence  the name of the place one in particular has the appearance of a vast brewing vessel and the water by its great agitation has acquired a yellow scum exactly resembling the yesty working of malt liquor Just beneath this the water darts down about thirty feet in form of a great white sheet the rocks below widen considerably and their clifty sides are fringed with wood Beyond is a view of a fine meadowy vale and the distant mountains near  Sterling  Two miles north is  Castle Campbell  Castle  Campbell  seated on a steep peninsulated rock between vast mountains having to the south a boundless view through a deep glen shagged with brush wood for the forests that once covered the country are now entirely destroyed Formerly from its darksome situation this pile was called the castle of  Gloom  and all the names of the adjacent places were suitable it was seated in the parish of  Dolor  was bounded by the glens of care and washed by the birns of  sorrow  This castle with the whole territory belonging to the family of  Argyle  underwent all the calamities of civil war in for its rival the Marquis of  Montrose  carried fire and sword through the whole estate The castle was ruined and its magnificent reliques exist as a monument of the horror of the times No wonder then that the  Marquis  experienced so woeful and ignominious a fate when he fell into the power of so exasperated a chieftain  Returned to my inn along the foot of the  Ochil  hills whose sides were covered with a fine verdure and fed great numbers of cattle and sheep The country below full of oats and in a very improving state the houses of the common people decent but  mostly covered with sods some were covered both with straw and sod The inhabitants extremely civil and never failed offering brandy or whey when I stopt to make enquiries at any of their houses  In the afternoon crossed a branch of the same hills which yielded plenty of oats descended into  Straithearn  a beautifull vale about thirty miles in length  Straithearn  full of rich meadows and corn fields divided by the river  Earn  which serpentines finely through the middle falling into the  Tay  of which there is a fight at the east end of the vale It is prettily diversified with groves of trees and gentlemen's houses among which towards the west end is  Castle Drummond  the forfeited seat of the Earl of  Perth  Castle Duplin  Near this place was the battle of  Duplin  between the  English  under the command of  Baliol  and the  Scots  The last were defeated and such a number of the name of  Hay  slain that the family would have been extinct had not several of their wives been left at home pregnant  the residence of the Earl of  Kinnouly  seated on the north side of the vale on the edge of a steep glen Only a single tower remains of the old castle the rest being modernized The front commands a pleasing view of the vale behind are plantations extending several miles in length all flourish greatly except those of ash I remarked in the woods some very large chesnuts horsechesnuts spruce and silver firs cedar and arbor vitae Broadleaved  laburnum  thrives in this country greatly grows to a great size and the wood is used in sineering  Fruits succeed here very indifferently  Fruit  even nonpareils require a wall to ripen grapes figs and late  peaches will not ripen the winters begin early and end late and are attended with very high winds I was informed that labor is dear here  Labor  notwithstanding it is only eightpence a day the common people not being yet got into a method of working so do very little for their wages Notwithstanding this improvements are carried on in these parts with great spirit both in planting and in agriculture Lord  Kinnoul  planted last year not sewer than eighty thousand trees besides  Scotch  firs so provides

Straithern  embellished with the seats of Lord  Kinnoul  Lord Rollo and of several other gentlemen the  Carse  or rich plain of  Gowrie Stormont  hills and the hill of  Kinnoul  whose vast cliff is remarkable for its beautifull pebbles The maeanders of the  Ern  which winds more than any river I at this time had seen are most enlivening additions to the scene The last turn it takes forms a fine peninsula prettily planted and just beyond it joins the  Tay  whose aestuary lies full in view the sea closing the prospect on this side  To the north lies the town of  Perth  with a view of part of its magnificent bridge which with the fine woods called  Perth  Parks the vast plain of  StraithTay  the winding of that noble river its islands and the grand boundary formed by the distant highlands finish this matchless scene The inhabitants of  Perth  are far from being blind to the beauties of their river for with singular pleasure they relate the tradition of the  Roman  army when it came in fight of the  Tay  Taus  Taciti vit Agr  bursting into the exclamation of  Ecce Tiberim  On approaching the town are some pretty walks handsomely planted and at a small distance the remains of some works of  Cromwel  called  Oliver  's Mount  PERTH is large and in general well built  PERTH  two of the streets are remarkably fine in some of the  lesser are yet a few wooden houses in the old style but as they decay the magistrates prohibit the rebuilding them in the old way There is but one parish which has two churches besides meetings for separatists who are very numerous One church which belonged to a monastery is very antient not a vestige of the last is now to be seen for the disciples of that rough apostle  Knox  made a general desolation of every aedifice that had given shelter to the worshippers of the church of  Rome  it being one of his maxims to pull down the nests and the rooks would fly away  The flourishing state of  Perth  is owing to two accidents the first that of numbers of  Cromwel  's wounded officers and soldiers chusing to reside here after he left the kingdom who introduced a spirit of industry among the people the other cause was the long continuance of the Earl of  Mar  's army here in which occasioned vast sums of money being spent in the place but this town as well as all  Scotland  dates its prosperity from the year the government of this part of  Great Britain  having never been settled till a little after that time The rebellion was a disorder violent in its operation but salutary in its effects  The trade of  Perth  is considerable  Trade  it exports annually one hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of linnen ten thousand of wheat and barley and about the same in cured salmon That fish is taken there in vast abundance three thousand have been caught in one morning weighing one with another sixteen pounds the whole capture fortyeight thousand pounds The fishery begins at St  Andrew  's Day and ends  August  th old style The rents of the fisheries amount to three thousand pounds  per annum  I was informed that smelts come up this river in  May  and  June  There has been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl got out of the freshwater muscles From the year to  Pearl  l worth were sent to  London  and sold from s to l s  per  ounce I was told that a pearl has been taken there that weighed grains but this fishery is at present exhausted from the avarice of the undertakers it once extended as far as  LoughTay  Gowrie  House is shewn to all strangers formerly the property and residence of the Earl of  Gowrie  whose tragical end and mysterious conspiracy if conspiracy there was are still fresh in the minds of the people of  Perth  At present the house is occupied by some companies of artillery I was shewn the staircase where the unhappy nobleman was killed  Gowrie  conspiracy  the window the frighted monarch  James  roared out of and that he escaped through when he was saved from the fury of the populace by Baily Roy a friend of  Gowrie  's who was extremely beloved in the town  From the little traditions preserved in the palace it seems as if  Gowrie  had not the left intent of murthering the King on the day his Majesty came to  Perth  the Earl was engaged to a weddingdinner with the Dean of Guild when the account of the king's design reached him he changed color on being taken so unprovided but the Dean forced him to accept the nuptial feast which was sent over to the Earl's house  When the king fled he passed by the seat of Sir  William Moncrief  near  Ernbridge  who happening to be walking out at that time heard from the mouth of his intrepid Majesty the whole relation but the Knight found it so marvellous and so disjointed as plainly to tell the King  that if it was a true story it was a very strange one  Gowrie  was a most accomplished gentleman after he had finished his studies he held the Professor of Philosophy's chair for two years in one of the  Italian  universities  Cross the  Tay  on a temporary bridge the stone bridge which is to consist of nine arches being at this time unfinished the largest arch is seventysix feet wide when complete it promises to be a most magnificent structure The river here is very violent and admits of scarce any navigation above but ships of eighty or ninety tuns come as far as the town  Scone  lies about a mile and half higher up  Scone  on the east bank of the river There was once here an abby of great antiquity  Founded by  Alexander  I for canons regular of St  Augustine  which was burnt by the reforming zealots of  Dundee  The present palace was begun by Earl  Gowrie  but on his death being granted by  James  VI to his favorite Sir  David Murray  of  Gospatrie  was completed by him who in gratitude to the king has in several parts of the house put up the royal arms The house is built round two courts the diningroom is large and handsome has an antient but magnificent chimneypiece the king's arms with this motto  Nobis haec invicta miserunt centum sex Proavi  Beneath are the  Murray  arms In the drawingroom is some good old tapestry with an excellent figure of  Mercury  In a small bedchamber is a medly scripturepiece in needlework with a border of animals pretty well done the work of  Mary Stuart  during her confinement in  Lochleven  castle but the house in general is in a manner unfurnished  The gallery is about a hundred and fiftyfive feet long the top arched divided into compartments filled with paintings in water colors of different sorts of huntings and that  Nimrod James  VI and his train appear in every piece  Till the destruction of the abby the kings of  Scotland  were crowned here sitting in the famous wooden chair which  Edward  I transported to  WestminsterAbby  much to the mortification of the  Scots  who esteemed it as their palladium  Charles  II before the battle of  Worcester  was crowned in the present chapel The old Pretender resided at  Scone  for a considerable time in and his son made it a visit in  Repassed the  Tay  at  Bullion  's Boat visited the field of  Loncarty  celebrated for the great victory  In the time of  Kenneth  who began his reign in  obtained by the  Scots  over the  Danes  Loncarty  by means of the gallant peasant  Hay  and his two sons who with no otherweapons than the yokes which they snatched from their oxen then at plough first put a stop to the flight of their countrymen and afterwards led them on to conquest The noble family of  Hay  are descended from this rustic hero and in memory of their action bear for their arms the instrument  of their victory with the allusive motto of  Sub jugo  There are on the spot several  tumuli  in which are frequently found bones deposited in loose stones disposed in form of a coffin Not remote is a spot which supplied me with far more agreeable ideas a tract of ground which in was a meer bog but now converted into good meadows and about fifty acres covered with linnen several other parts with buildings and all the apparatus of the linnen manufacture extremely curious and worth seeing carried on by the industrious family of the  Sandimans  who annually make four hundred thousand yards of linnen  The country is good full of barley oats and flax in abundance but after a few miles travelling is succeeded by a black heath ride through a beautifull plantation of pines and after descending an easy slope the plain beneath suddenly contracts itself into a narrow glen the prospect before me strongly marked the entrance into the  Highlands  the hills that bounded it on each side being lofty and rude  Birnam  Wood  On the left was  Birnam  Wood  Dunsinane  which seems never to have recovered the march its ancestors made to  Dunsinane  I was shewn at a great distance a high ridge of hills where some remains of that famous fortress *  Macbeth  's castle are said yet to exist  The pass into the  Highlands  is awefully magnificent high craggy and often naked mountains present themselves to view approach very near each other and in many parts are fringed with wood overhanging and darkening the  Tay  that rolls with great rapidity beneath After some advance  Dunkeld Cathedral  vance in this hollow a most beautifull knowl covered with pines appears full in view and soon after the town of  Dunkeld  seated under and environed by crags  Dunkeld  partly naked partly wooded with summits of a vast height Lay at  Inver  a good inn on the west side of the river  Crossed it in a boat attended by a tame swan  JULY  which was perpetually solliciting our favours by putting its neck over the sides of the ferryboat Land in the Duke of  Athol  's gardens which are extremely pleasing washed by the river and commanding from different parts of the walks the most beautifull and picturesque views of wild and gloomy nature that can be conceived Trees of all kinds grow here extremely well and even so southern a shrub as  Portugal  laurel flourishes greatly In the gardens are the ruins of the cathedral once a magnificent aedifice as appears by the beautifull round pillars still standing but the choir is preserved and at present used as a church In the burialplace of the family is a large monument of the Marquis of  Athol  hung with the arms of the numerous connections of the family In another part is a tomb of an old bishop  On the other side the river is a pleasing walk along the banks of the water of  Bran  Rivers in  Scotland  are very frequently called  waters  a great and rapid torrent full of immense stones On a rock at the end of the walk is a neat building impending over a most horrible chasm into which the river precipitates itself with great noise and fury from a considerable height The windows of the pavillion are formed of painted glass some of the  panes are red which makes the water resemble a fiery cataract About a mile further is another  rumbling brig  like but inferior in grandeur to that near  Kinross  The town of  Dunkeld  is small and has a small linnen manufacture Much company resorts here in the summer months for the benefit of drinking goats milk and whey I was informed here that those animals will eat serpents as it is well known that stags do  After a ride of two miles along a narrow strait amidst trees and often in fight of the  Tay  was driven by rain into a fisherman's hut who entertained me with an account of his business said he paid ten pounds  per ann  for the liberty of two or three miles of the river sold the first fish of the season at threepence a pound after that got three shillings  per  fish The houses in these parts began to be covered with broom which lasts three or four years their insides mean and very scantily furnished but the owners civil sensible and of the quickest apprehensions  The strait now widens into a vale plentifull in oats barley and flax and well peopled on the right is the junction of the  Tay  and the  Tumel  the channels of these rivers are wide full of gravel the mark of their devastation during floods Due north is the road to  Blair  and  Fort Augustus  through the noted pass of  Killicrankie  turn to the left ride opposite to  Castle Menzies  reach  Taymouth  the seat of the Earl of  Breadalbane  Taymouth  Its name in old maps is  Balloch  i e the mouth of the loch  lies in a vale scarce a mile broad  JULY c  Taymouth  very fertile bounded on each side by high mountains finely planted Those on the south are covered with trees or with corn fields far up their sides The hills on the north are planted with pines and other trees and vastly steep and have a very  alpine  look but particularly resemble the great slope opposite the  grande Chartreuse  in  Dauphinè  His Lordship's policy  This word here signifies improvements or demesne when used by a merchant or tradesman signifies their warehouses shops and the like  surrounds the house which stands in the park and is one of the few in which sallow deer are seen  The ground is in remarkable fine order owing to his Lordship's assiduity in clearing it from stones with which it was once covered A  Blaster  was in constant employ to blast the great stones with gunpowder for by reason of their size there was no other method of removing them  The  Berceau  walk is very magnificent  Walks  composed of great trees forming a fine  gothic  arch and probably that species of architecture owed its origin to such vaulted shades The walk on the bank of the  Tay  is fifty feet wide and two and twenty hundred yards long but is to be continued as far as the junction of the  Tay  and the  Lion  which is about as far more The first runs on the sides of the walk with great rapidity is clear but not colorless for its pellucidness is like that of brown crystal as is the case with most of the rivers of  Scotland  which receive their tinge from the bogs  The  Tay  has here a wooden bridge two hundred feet long leading to a white feat on the side of the opposite hill commanding a fine view up and down  StraithTay  The rich meadows beneath the winding of the river the beginning of  LoughTay  the discharge of the river out of it the neat village and church of  Kenmor  form a most pleasing and magnificent prospect  The view from the temple of  Venus  is that of the lake  LoughTay  with a nearer sight of the church and village and the discharge of the river The lake is about a mile broad and about fifteen long bounded on each side by lofty mountains makes three great bends which adds to its beauty Those on the south are well planted and finely cultivated high up interspersed with the habitations of the  Highlanders  not singly but in small groupes as if they loved society or clanship they are very small mean and without windows or chimnies and are the disgrace of  North Britain  as its lakes and rivers are its glory  LoughTay  is in many places a hundred fathoms deep and within as many yards of the shore fiftyfour  Till the present year this lake was supposed to be as incapable of freezing as  LoughNess LoughEarn  and  LoughEach  tho'  LoughRaynac  and even  LoughFine  an arm of the sea often does But in  March  last so rigorous and uncommon was the cold that about the th of that month this vast body of water was frozen over in one part from side to side in the space of one night and so strong was the ice as greatly to damage a boat which was caught in it  LoughTay  abounds with Pike Perch Eels Salmon and Trout of the last some have been taken that weighed above thirty pounds Of these species the  Highlanders  abhor Eels and also Lampries fancying from the form that they are too nearly related to Serpents  I was informed that at the head of the lake are the remains of an old castle called  Finlarig  belonging to Lord  Breadalbane  and of a park finely wooded with old oaks chesnuts and other timber    The north side is less wooded but more cultivated The vast hill of  Laurs  with beds of snow on it through great part of the year rises above the rest and the still loftier mountain of  Benmor  closes the view far beyond the end of the lake All this country abounds with game such as Grous Ptarmigans  Br Zool illustr    tab  xiii  Stags and a peculiar species of Hare which is found only on the summits of the highest hills  White Hare  and never mixes with the common kind which is frequent enough in the vales  The same  p    tab  xlvii  This species is grey in summer white in winter is smaller than the brown Hare and more delicate meat  The  Ptarmigans  inhabit the very summits of the highest mountains  Ptarmigan  amidst the rocks perching among the grey stones and during summer are scarce to be distinguished from them by reason of their color They seldom take long flights but fly about like pigeons are silly birds and so tame as to suffer a stone to be slung at them without rising It is not necessary to have a dog to find them They taste so like a Grous as to be scarce  distinguishable During winter their plumage except a few feathers in the tail are of a pure white the color of the snow in which they bury themselves in heaps as a protection from the rigorous air  Royston  Crows  Birds  called here Hooded Crows and in the  Erse Feanagh  are very common and reside here the whole year They breed in the hills in all sorts of trees lay six eggs have a thriller note than the common sort are much more mischievous pick out the eyes of lambs and even of horses when engaged in bogs but for want of other food will eat cranberries and other mountain berries  Ring Ouzels breed among the hills and in autumn descend in flocks to seed on the berries of the wicken trees  Sea Eagles breed in ruined towers but quit the country in winter the black Eagles continue there the whole year  It is very difficult to leave the environs of this delightfull place and before I go within doors I must recall to mind the fine winding walks on the south side of the hills the great beech sixteen feet in girth the picturesque birch with its long streaming branches the hermitage the great cataracts adjacent and the darksome chasm beneath I must enjoy over again the view of the fine reach of the  Tay  and its union with the broad water of the  Lion  I must step down to view the druidical circles of stones called in the  Erse Tibberd  and lastly  Taybridge  I must visit  Taybridge  and as far as my pen can contribute extend the same of our military countrymen  Cascade near Taymouth  who among other works worthy of the  Romans  founded this bridge and left its history

his descendents and along the body of the tree are nine small heads in oval frames with the names on the margins all done with great neatness the second son was first of the house of  Breadalbane

binding the  black book  with some beautifull drawings in it on vellum of the  Breadalbane  family in watercolors In the first page is old Sir  Duncan  between two other figures then follow several chiefs of the family among whom is Sir  Colin  Knight of  Rhodes  who died aged At the end is a manuscript history of the family ending I think in  JULY  Went to divine service at  Kinmore  Or the

person among them There were two services one in  English  the other in  Erse  After the first numbers of people of both sexes went out of church and fearing themselves in the churchyard made in their motly habits a gay and picturesque appearance The devotion of the common people  Highland  congregation  on the usual days of worship is as much to be admired as their conduct at the sacrament is to be censured It is celebrated but once in a year when there are in some places three thousand communicants and as many idle spectators as can crowd each side of a long table and the elements are rudely shoven from one to another and in some places fighting and other indecencies ensue it is often made a season for debauchery so to this day  Jack  cannot be persuaded to eat his meat like a christian  Tale of a Tub  formerly the sacrament was administered but once in two years    Every Sunday a collection is made for the sick or necessitous for poor's rates are unknown in every country parish in  Scotland  Notwithstanding the common people are but just rouzed from their native indolence very few beggars are seen in  North Britain  either they are full masters of the lesson of being content with a very little or what is more probable they are possessed of a spirit that will  struggle hard with necessity before it will bend to the asking of alms  Visited a pretty little island tusted with trees in  LochTay  not far from the shore on it are the ruins of a priory or dependent on that at  Scoone  founded in by  Alexander  the First in which were deposited the remains of his Queen  Sybilla  natural daughter to  Henry  I it was founded by  Alexander  to have the prayers of the Monks for the repose of his soul and that of his royal confort  As appears from a grant made by that Monarch of the isle in  LochTay Ut Ecclesia  DEI  ibi pro me et pro Anima  SYRILLAE  Reginae ibi desuncta fabricetur  c  To this island the  Campbells  retreated during the successes of the Marquiss of  Montrose  where they defended themselves against that hero which was one cause of his violent resentment against the whole name  Rode to  Glenlion  JULY  went by the side of the river  This river freezes but the  Tay  which receives it never does  that gives name to it It has now lost its antient title of  Duie  or  Black  given it on account of a great battle between the  Mackays  and the  Macgregors  after which the conquerors are said to have stained the water with red by washing in it their bloody swords and spears On the right is a rocky hill called  Shiballen  or the Paps Enter  Glenlion  through a strait pass the vale is narrow but fertile the banks of the river steep rocky and wooded through which appear the rapid water of the  Lion  On the north is a round fortress on the top of the hill to which in old times the natives retreated on any invasion A little further on a plain is a small  Roman  camp  It possibly might have been made during the expedition of Severus who penetrated to the extremity of this island it was the most northern work of the  Romans  I had my intelligence of  called by the Highlanders  Fortingal  or the Fort of the Strangers themselves they style  Nafian  or descendents of  Fingal  In  Fortingal  church are the remains of a prodigious yewtree  Great yew  whose ruins measured fiftysix feet and a half in circumference  Saw at a gentleman's house in  Glenlion  a curious walkingstaff belonging to one of his ancestors it was iron cased in leather five feet long at the top a neat pair of extended wings like a  caduceus  but on being shook a poniard two feet nine inches long darted out  He also favoured me with the fight of a very antient brotche which the Highlanders use like the  fibula  of the  Romans  to fasten their vest it is made of silver is round with a bar cross the middle from whence are two tongues to fasten the solds of the garments one side is studded with pearl or coarse gems in a very rude manner on the other are certain letters I could not make out  Return south and come at once in fight of  LochTay  The day being very fine and calm the whole scene was most beautifully repeated in the water I must not omit that on the north side of this lake is a most excellent road which runs the whole length of it leading to  Teindrum  and  Inveraray  in  Argyleshire  and is the route which travellers must take who make what I call the  petit tour  Which comprehends the route I have described adding to it from  Taymouth  along the road on the side of the lake to  Killin  miles from thence to  Teindrum    Glenorchie    Inveraray    Luss  on the banks of  Lochlomond    Dunbarton    Glasgow    Sterling    Edinburgh  by  Hopetoun  House a tract unparalleled for the variety and frequency of fine and magnificent scenery  of  Scotland  This whole road was made at the  sole expence of the present Lord  Breadalbane  who to facilitate the travelling also erected thirtytwo stonebridges over the torrents that rush from the mountains into the lake They will find the whole country excell in roads  Roads  partly military partly done by statute labor and much by the munisicence of the great men  I was informed that Lord  Breadalbane  's estate was so extensive that he could ride a hundred miles an end on it even as far as the West Sea where he has also some islands These great properties are divided into districts called  Officiaries  a ground officer presides over each and has three four or five hundred men under his care he superintends the duties due from each to their Lord such as fetching peat bringing coal from  Perth  c which they do at their own expence on horses backs travelling in strings the tail of one horse being fastened by a cord which reaches to the head of the next the horses are little and generally white or grey and as the farms are very small it is common for four people to keep a plough between them each furnishing a horse and this is called a horse gang  The north side of  LochTay  is very populous for in sixteen square miles are seventeen hundred and eightysix souls on the other side about twelve hundred The country within these thirty years is grown very industrious and manufactures a great deal of thread They spin with rocks  Their Lord gives among them annually a great number of spinningwheels  which they do while they attend their cattle on the hills  and at the three or four fairs in the year held at  Taymouth  about sixteen hundred pounds worth of yarn is sold out of  Breadalbane  only  Much of this may be owing to the good sense and humanity of the chieftain but much again is owing to the abolition of the seudal tenures or vassalage for before that was effected which was done by the influence of a Chancellor  Earl of  Hardwick  whose memory  Scotland  gratefully adores for that service the Strong oppressed the Weak the Rich the Poor Courts indeed were held and juries called but juries of vassals too dependent and too timid to be relied on

the Northern banks appeared very barren part of the Southern finely covered with a forest of pine and birch the first natural woods I had seen of pines  Pine Forest  rode a good way into it but observed no trees of any size except a birch sixteen feet in circumference the ground beneath the trees is covered  with heath bilberies and dwarf arbutus whose glossy leaves make a pretty appearance this place gives shelter to black game and is at present the farthest Southern resort of roes for very few ever straggle lower down near these woods is a sawmill which brings in about l  per ann  the deal which is the red sort is fold in plank to different parts of the country carried on horses backs for the trees are now grown so scarce as not to admit of exportation  Some PotAsh is also made of the Birch Wood    The lake affords no other fish than trouts and bull trouts the last as I was informed are sometimes taken of the length of four feet and a half many water fowl breed in the birns or little streams that trickle into the lake among others different sort of grebes and divers I was told of one which the inhabitants call  Turuvachal  that makes a great noise before storms and by their description seems to be the  Fluder  of  Gesner  This country was once the property of  Robertson  The Poet  Struan  of  Struan  who had been in the rebellion of had his estate restored but in rebelling a second time the country was burnt and the estate annexed to the crown he returned a few years after and died as he lived a most abandoned sot notwithstanding which he had a genius for poetry and left behind him a volume of elegies and other pieces in some of which he elegantly laments the ravages of war among his vassals and the loss of his favourite scenes and in particular his fountain  Argentine  The country is perfectly highland and in spite of the intercourse this and the neighboring parts have of late years had with the rest of the world it still retains some of its antient customs and superstitions  Superstitions  they decline daily but least their memory should be lost I shall mention several that are still practised or but very lately difused in the tract I had passed over Such a record will have this advantage when the follies are quite extinct in teaching the unshackled and enlightened mind the difference between the pure ceremonies of religion and the wild and anile flights of superstition  The belief in spectres still exists  Spectres  of which I had a remarkable proof while I was in the county of  Breadalbane  a poor visionary who had been working in his cabbagegarden imagined that he was raised suddenly into the air and conveyed over a wall into an adjacent cornfield that he found himself surrounded by a crowd of men and women many of whom he knew to have been dead some years and who appeared to him skimming over the tops of the unbended corn and mingling together like bees going to hive that they spoke an unknown language and with a hollow found that they very roughly pushed him to and fro but on his uttering the name of GOD all vanished but a female sprite who seizing him by the shoulder obliged him to promise an assignation at that very hour that day sevenight that he then found that his hair was all tied in double knots and that he had almost lost the use of his speech that he kept his word with the spectre whom he soon saw come floating thro' the air towards him that he spoke to her but she  told him at that time she was in too much haste to attend to him but bid him go away and no harm should befall him and so the affair rested when I left the country But it is incredible the mischief these  AEgri Somnia  did in the neighborhood the friends and relation of the deceased whom the old Dreamer had named were in the utmost anxiety at finding them in such bad company in the other world the almost extinct belief of the old idle tales began again to gain ground and the good minister will have many a weary discourse and exhortation before he can eradicate the absurd ideas this idle story has revived  In this part of the country the notion of witchcraft is quite lost it was observed to cease almost immediately on the repeal of the witch act a proof what a dangerous instrument it was in the hands of the vindictive or of the credulous  Among the superstitious customs these are the most singular  Unlucky day  A Highlander never begins any thing of consequence on the day of the week on which the d of  May  falls which he styles  Lagh Sbeacbanna na bleanagh  or the dismal day  On the st of  May  Beltein  the herdsmen of every village hold their  Beltein  My account of this and every other ceremony mentioned in this Journal was communicated to me by gentlemen resident on the spot where they were performed  a rural sacrifice they cut a square trench on the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large caudle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whisky  for each of the company must contribute something The rites begin with spilling some or the caudle on the ground by way of libation on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulders says  This I give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep  and so on After that they life the same ceremony to the noxious animals  This I give to thee Fox spare thou my lambs this to thee O hooded Crow this to thee O Eagle  When the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle and after the feast is finished what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that purpose but on the next  Sunday  they reassemble and finish the reliques of the first entertainment  A custom favoring of the  Scotch Beltein  prevails in  Gloucestershire  particularly about  Newent  and the neighboring parishes on the twelfth day or on the  Epiphany  in the evening all the servants of every particular farmer assemble together in one or the fields that has been sown with wheat on the border of which in the most conspicuous or most elevated place they make twelve fires of straw in a row around one of which made larger than the rest they drink a chearful glass of cyder to their master's health success to the future harvest and then returning home they feast on cakes made of carraways c soak'd in cyder which they clame as a reward for their past labors in sowing the grain This seems to resemble a custom of the antient Danes who in their addresses to their rural deities emptied on every invocation a cup in honor of them NIORDI et FREJAE  memoria poculis recolebatur annua ut ipsis contingeret selicitas frugumque et reliqua annona uberrimus proventus

after the death of any person the relations and friends of the deceased meet at the house attended by bagpipe or fiddle the nearest of kin be it wife son or daughter opens a melancholy ball dancing and greeting  i e  crying violently at the same time and this continues till daylight but with such gambols and frolicks among the younger part of the company that the loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night If the corps remains unburied for two nights the same rites are renewed Thus  Scythian  like they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery  The  Coranich  Coranich  or singing at funerals is still in use in some places the songs are generally in praise of the deceased or a recital of the valiant deeds of him or ancestors I had not the fortune to be present at any in  North Britain  but formerly assisted at one in the south of  Ireland  where it was performed in the fullness of horror The cries are called by the  Irish  the  'Ulogobne  and  Hûllulu  two words extremely expressive of the found uttered on these occasions and being of  Celtic  stock Etymologists would swear to be the origin of the  of the  Greeks  and  Ululatus  of the  Latins Virgil  is very fond of using the last whenever any of his females are distressed as are others of the  Roman  Poets and generally on occasions similar to this  It was my fortune to arrive at a certain town in  Kerry  at the time that a person of some distinction departed this life my curiosity led me to the house where the funeral seemed conducted in the purest classical form  Quodcunque aspicerem luctus gemitusque sonabant Formaque non taciti funeris intùs erat  In short the  conclamatio  was set up by the friends in the fame manner as  Virgil  describes that consequential of  Dido  's death  Lamentis gemituque et faemines ululatu Tecta fremunt  Immediately after this followed another ceremony fully described by  Cambden  in his account of the manners of the antient  Irish  the earnest expostulations and reproaches given to the deceased for quitting this world where she enjoyed so many blessings so good a husband such fine children This custom is of great antiquity for  Euryalus  's mother makes the same pathetic address to her dead son  Tune ilia senectae Sera meae requies potuisti relinquere solam Crudelis  But when the time approached for carrying out the corps the cry was redoubled  Tremulis ululatibus aethera complent  A numerous band of females waiting in the outer court to attend the herse and to pay in chorus  the last tribute of their voices The habit of this sorrowing train and the neglect of their persons were admirably suited to the occasion their robes were black and flowing resembling the antient  Palla  their hair long and disheveled I might say  Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla  Canidiam  pedibus nudis passoque capillo Cum Sagana mojore ululantem  Among these mourners were dispersed the females who sung the praises of the deceased and were in the place of the  Mulieres Praeficae  of the  Romans  and like them were a mercenary tribe I could not but observe that they overdid their parts as  Horace  acquaints us the mourners of his days did  Ut qui conducti plorant in funera dicunt Et saciunt prope plura dolentibus ex animo  The corps was carried slowly along the verge of a most beautifull lake the  ululatus  was continued and the whole procession ended among the venerable ruins of an old abby But to return to  North Britain  Midwives give newborn babes a small spoonfull of

neat small houses inhabited by veteran soldiers who were settled here after the peace of had land and three pounds in money given and nine pounds lent to begin the world with In some few places this

which range at certain times of the year in herds of five hundred Some grow to a great size I have heard of one that weighed stone  Scots  or lb exclusive of head entrails and skin The hunting of these animals was formerly after the manner of an  Eastern  monarch Thousands of vassals surrounded a great tract of country  Great huntings  and drove the Deer to the spot where the Chieftains were stationed who shot them at their leisure The magnificent hunt made by an Earl of  Athol  near this place for the amusement of  James  V and the Queenmother is too remarkable to be omitted the relation is therefore given as described by Sir  David Lindsay  Hist Scotland    who in all probability assisted at it  The Earl of  Athole  hearing of the King's coming made great provision for him in all things pertaining to a prince that he was as well served and eased with all things necessary to his estate as he had been in his own palace of  Edinburgh  For I heard say this noble Earl gart make a curious palace to the King to his Mother and to the Embassador where they were so honourably eased and lodged as they had been in  England France Italy  or  Spain  concerning the time and equivalent for their hunting and pastime which was builded in the midst of a fair meadow a fair palace of green timber wind with green birks that were green both  under and above which was fashioned in four quarters and in every quarter and nuik thereof a great round as it had been a blockhouse which was lofted and gested the space of three house height the floors laid with green scarets spreats medwarts and flowers that no man knew whereon he zeid but as he had been in a garden Further there were two great rounds in ilk side of the gate and a great portculleis of tree falling down with the manner of a barrace with a drawbridge and a great stank of water of sixteen foot deep and thirty foot of breadth And also this palace within was hung with fine tapestry and arrasses of silk and lighted with fine glass windows in all airths that this palace was as pleasantly decored with all necessaries pertaining to a prince as it had been his own palaceroyal at home Further this Earl gart make such provision for the King and his Mother and the Embassador that they had all manner of meats drinks and delicates that were to be gotten at that time in all  Scotland  either in burgh or land that is to say all kind of drink as ale beer wine both white and claret  malvery muskadel Hippocras aquavitae  Further there was of meats wheatbread mainbread and gingebread with fleshes beef mutton lamb veal venison goose grice capon coney cran swan partridge plover duck drake brisselcock and pawnies blackcock and muirfowl cappercaillies and also the stanks that were round about the palace were full of all delicate fishes as salmonds trouts pearches  pikes eels and all other kind of delicate fishes that could be gotten in fresh waters and all ready for the banket Syne were there proper stewards cunning baxters excellent cooks and potingars with confections and drugs for their deserts and the halls and chambers were prepared with costly bedding vessel and napery according for a king so that he wanted none of his orders more than he had been at home in his own palace The King remained in this wilderness at the hunting the space of three days and three nights and his company as I have shewn I heard men say it cost the Earl of  Athole  every day in expences a thousand pounds  But hunting meetings among the great men were often the preludes to rebellion for under that pretence they collected great bodies of men without suspicion which at length occasioned an act of parlement prohibiting such dangerous assemblies  Set out for the county of  Aberdeen  ride eastward over a hill into  GlenTilt  AUG  GlenTilt  famous in old times for producing the most hardy warriors is a narrow glen several miles in length bounded on each side by mountains of an amazing height on the south is the great hill of  Ben y glo  whose base is thirtyfive miles in circumference and whose summit towers far above the others The sides of many of these mountains are covered with fine verdure and are excellent sheepwalks but entirely woodless The road is the most dangerous and the most horrible I ever travelled a narrow path so rugged that our horses often were obliged to cross their  legs in order to pick a secure place for their feet while at a considerable and precipitous depth beneath roared a black torrent rolling through a bed of rock solid in every part but where the  Tilt  had worn its antient way Salmon force their passage even as high as this dreary stream in spite of the distance from the sea and the difficulties they have to encounter  Ascend a steep hill on the top of which we refreshed ourselves with some goats whey  Sheelins  at a  Sheelin  or as it is sometimes called  Arrie  i e  a house made of turf  and  Bothay  a dairyhouse where the Highland shepherds or graziers live during summer with their herds and flocks and during that season make butter and cheese Their whole furniture consists of a few horn spoons their milking utensils a couch formed of sods to lie on and a rug to cover them Their food oatcakes butter or cheese and often the coagulated blood of their cattle spread on their bannocks Their drink milk whey and sometimes by way of indulgence whisky Such dairyhouses are common to most mountainous countries those in  Wales  are called  Vottys  or Summerhouses those on the  Swiss Alps Sennes  Dined on the side of  LochTilt  a small piece of water swarming with Trouts Continued our journey over a wild black moory melancholy tract Reached  Braemar  Brae  signifies the steep face of any hill  the country almost instantly changed and in lieu of dreary wastes a rich vale plenteous in corn and grass succeeded Cross the  Dee  near its head which from an insignificant  stream in the course of a very few miles increases to the size of a great river from the influx of numbers of other waters The rocks of  Braemar  on the east  Braemar  are exceedingly romantic finely wooded with pine The clifts are very lofty and their front most rugged and broken with vast pines growing out of their fissures  This tract abounding with game was in old times the annual resort of numbers of nobility who assembled here to pass a month or two in the amusements of the chace Their huntings resembled campaigns they lived in temporary cottages called  Lonquhards  were all dressed in an uniform habit conformable to that of the country and passed their time with jollity and good chear most admirably described by  John Taylor  the water poet who in made there his  Pennilesse Pilgrimage  p and describes the rural luxury with all the glee of a  Sancho

leave so important an affair to chance so sets off thus amply provided in his triumphal car  Le Seigneur says  Fouilloux  doit avoir fa petite charrette la ou il sera dedans avec la Fillette aagèe de

Mar  tenants and purveyors to victual our campe which consisted of fourteen or fifteen hundred men and horses The manner of the hunting is this five or six hundred men doe rise early in the morning and they doe disperse themselves divers wayes and seven eight or ten miles  compasse they doe bring or chase in the deer in many heards two three or four hundred in a heard to such or such a place as the noblemen shall appoint them then when day is come the lords and gentlemen of their companies doe ride or go to the said places sometimes wading up to the middles through bournes and rivers and then they being come to the place doe lye down on the ground till those foresaid scouts which are called the  Tinekhell  do bring down the deer but as the proverb says of a bad cooke so these  Tinckhell  men doe lick their own singers for besides their bowes and arrows which they carry with them wee can heare now and then a harguebuse or a musquet goe off which doe seldom discharge in vaine then after we had stayed three houres or there abouts we might perceive the deer appeare on the hills round about us their heads making a shew like a wood which being followed close by the  Tinckhell  are chased down into the valley where wee lay then all the valley on each side being waylaid with a hundred couple of strong Irish greyhounds they are let loose as occasion serves upon the heard of deere that with dogs gunnes arrowes durks and daggers in the space of two houres fourscore fat deere were slaine which after are disposed of some one way and some another twenty or thirty miles and more than enough left for us to make merry withall at our rendevouze Being come to our lodgings there was such baking boyling rosting and stewing as if Cook Russian had been there to have scalded the Devill in his feathers  But to proceed  Pass by the castle of  Braemar  a square tower built about a hundred and fifty years ago to curb the discontented chieftains but at present unnecessarily garrisoned by a company of foot being rented by the Government from Mr  Farquharson  of  Invercauld  whose house I reached in less than half an hour  Invercauld  is seated in the centre of the  Grampian  hills in a fertile vale washed by the  Dee  a large and rapid river nothing can be more beautifull than the different views from the several parts of it On the northern entrance immense ragged and broken crags bound one side of the prospect over whose grey sides and summits is scattered the melancholy green of the picturesque pine which grows out of the naked rock where one would think nature would have denied vegetation  A little lower down is the castle abovementioned formerly a necessary curb on the little kings of the country but at present serves scarce any real purpose but to adorn the landscape  The views from the skirts of the plain near  Invercauld  are very great the hills that immediately bound it are cloathed with trees particularly with birch whose long and pendent boughs waving a vast height above the head surpass the beauties of the weeping willow  The southern extremity is preeminently magnificent the mountains form there a vast theatre the bosom of which is covered with extensive forests of pines above the trees grow scarcer and scarcer and then seem only to sprinkle the surface after  Braemar Castle  which vegetation ceases and naked summits  The highest is called  Ben y bourd  under which is a small lough which I was told had ice the latter end of  July  of a surprising height succeed many of them topped with perpetual snow and as a fine contrast to the scene the great cataract of  Garvalbourn  which seems at a distance to divide the whole foams amidst the dark forest rashing from rock to rock to a vast distance  Some of these hills are supposed to be the highest part of  Great Britain  their height has not yet been taken but the conjecture is made from the great descent of the  Dee  which runs from  Braemar  The most distant from the sea of any place in  North Britain  to the sea above seventy miles with a most rapid course  Rode to take a nearer view of the environs crossed the  Dee  on a good stonebridge built by the Government and entered on excellent roads into a magnificent forest of pines of many miles extent  Pine Forest  Some of the trees are of a vast size I measured several that were ten eleven and even twelve feet in circumference and near sixty feet high forming a most beautifull column with a fine verdant capital These trees are of a great age having as is supposed seen two centuries The value of these trees is considerable Mr  Farqubarson  informed me that by sawing and retailing them he has got for eight hundred trees fiveandtwenty shillings each they are sawed in an adjacent sawmill into plank ten feet long eleven inches broad and three thick and sold for two shillings apiece  Near this antient forest is another consisting of smaller trees almost as high but very slender one grows in a singular manner out of the top of a great stone and notwithstanding it seems to have no other nourishment than what it gets from the dews is above thirty feet high  The prospect above these forests is very extraordinary a distant view of hills over a surface of verdant pyramids of pines  This whole tract abounds with game  Stags  the Stags at this time were ranging in the mountains  Roes  but the little Roebucks  These animals are reared with great difficulty even when taken young eight out often generally die  were perpetually bounding before us and the black game often sprung under our feet  Birds  The tops of the hills swarmed with  Grous  and  Ptarmigans  Green Plovers Whimbrels and Snowflecks  Br Zeal illustr    tab  xi  breed here the last assemble in great flocks during winter and collect so closely in their eddying flight as to give the sportsman opportunity of killing numbers at a shot Eagles  The Ringtail Eagle called here the Black Eagle I suspect from the description that the Dotrel breeds here I heard also of a bird called here  Snatach na cuirn  but could not procure it  Peregrine Falcons and Goshawks breed here the Falcons in rocks the Goshawks in trees the last pursues its prey an end and dashes through every thing in pursuit but if it misses its quarry ceases after two or three hundred yards flight These birds are proscribed half a crown is given for an eagle a shilling for a hawk or hooded crow  Foxes are in these parts very ravenous feeding on roes sheep and even she goats  Rooks visit these vales in autumn to feed on the different sort of berries but neither winter nor breed here  I saw flying in the forests the greater Bulfinch of Mr  Edwards tab  the  Loxia enucleator  of  Linnaeus  whose food is the seed of pine cones a bird common to the north of  Europe  and  America  On our return passed under some high clifts with large woods of birch intermixed This tree is used for all sorts of implements of husbandry  Birch Woods  roofing of small houses wheels fuel the Highlanders also tan their own leather with the bark and a great deal of excellent wine is extracted from the live tree Observed among these rocks a sort of projecting shelf on which had been a hut accessible only by the help of some thongs fastened by some very expert climbers to which the family got in time of danger in former days with their most valuable moveables  The houses of the common people in these parts are shocking to humanity  Cottages  formed of loose stones and covered with clods which they call  devish  or with heath broom or branches of fir they look at a distance like so many black molehills The inhabitants live very poorly on oatmeal barleycakes and potatoes their drink whisky sweetened with honey The men are thin but strong idle and lazy except employed in the chace or any thing that looks like amusement are content with their hard fare and will not exert themselves farther than to get what they deem necessaries The women are more industrious spin their own husbands cloaths and get money by knitting stockings  the great trade of the county The common women are in general most remarkably plain and soon acquire an old look and by being much exposed to the weather without hats such a grin and contraction of the muscles as heightens greatly their natural hardness of features I never saw so much plainness among the lower rank of females but the  ne plus ultra  of hard features is not found till you arrive among the fishwomen of  Aberdeen  Tenants pay their rent generally in this country in money except what they pay in poultry which is done to promote the breed as the gentry are so remote from any market Those that rent a mill pay a hog or two an animal so detested by the Highlanders that very few can be prevaled on to taste it in any shape Labor is here very cheap the usual pay being fifty shillings a year and two pecks of oatmeal a week  Pursued my journey east  AUG  along a beautifull road by the river side in sight of the pine forests The vale now grows narrow and is filled with woods of birch and alder Saw on the roadside the seats of gentlemen high built and once defensible The peasants cultivate their little land with great care to the very edge of the stony hills All the way are vast masses of granite the same which is called in  Cornwall  Moorstone  The Glen contracts and the mountains approach each other Quit the  Highlands  passing between two great rocks  Pass of  Bellitir  called the Pass of  Bollitir  a very narrow strait whose bottom is covered with the tremendous ruins of the precipices that bound the road I was informed that here the wind rages  with great fury during winter and catching up the snow in eddies whirls it about with such impetuosity as makes it dangerous for man or beast to be out at that time Rain also pours down sometimes in deluges and carries with it stone and gravel from the hills in such quantity that I have seen these  spates  as they are called lie cross the roads as the  avelenches  or snowfalls do those of the  Alps  In many parts of the  Highlands  were  bospitia  for the reception of travellers called by the  Scotch Spittles  or hospitals the same were usual in  Wales  where they are styled  Yspitty  and in both places were maintained by the religious houses as similar  Asylums  are to this day supported in many parts of the  Alps  This pass is the eastern entrance into the Highlands The country now assumes a new face the hills grow less but the land more barren and is chiefly covered with heath and rock The edges of the  Dee  are cultivated but the rest only in patches among which is generally a groupe of small houses There is also a change of trees oak being the principal wood but not much of that Refreshed my horses at a hamlet called  Tulloch  and looking west saw the great mountain  Lagbin y gair  which is always covered with snow  Observed several vast plantations of pines planted by gentlemen near their seats such a laudable spirit prevails in this respect that in another halfcentury it never shall be said that to spy the nakedness of the land are you come  Dine at the little village of  Kincaird  Hereabouts the common people cultivate a great deal of  cabbage The oatfields are inclosed with rude low mounds of stone  Lay at a mean house at  Banchorie  The country from  Bollitir  to this place dull unless where varied with the windings of the river or with the plantations  The nearer to  Aberdeen  AUG  the lower the country grows and the greater quantity of corn in general oats and barley for there is very little wheat sown in these parts Reach  ABERDEEN  ABERDEEN  a fine city lying on a small bay formed by the  Dee  The bridge lies about two miles south of the town and consiste seven neat arches  deep enough for ships of two hundred tuns The town is about two miles in circumference and contains thirteen thousand souls and about three thousand in the suburbs It once enjoyed a good share of the tobacco trade but was at length forced to resign it to  Glasgow  which was so much more conveniently situated for it At present its imports are from the  Baltic  and a few merchants trade to the  WestIndies  and  North America  Stocking trade  Its exports are stockings thread salmon and oatmeal the first is a most important article as appears by the following state of it For this manufacture pounds worth of wool is annually imported and pounds worth of oil Of this wool is annually made dozen pairs of stockings worth at an average l s  per  dozen These are made by the country people in almost all parts of this great county who get s  per  dozen for spinning and s  per  dozen for knitting so that there is annually paid  them l s And besides there is about l value of stockings manufactured from the wool of the county which encourages the breed of sheep much for even as high as  Invercauld  the farmer sells his sheep at twelve shillings apiece and keeps them till they are four or five years old for the sake of the wool About combers are also employed constantly The thread manufacture is another considerable article tho' trifling in comparison of the woollen  The salmon fisheries on the  Dee  and the  Don  Salmon  are a good branch of trade about boats and men are employed on the first and in some years lb of fish have been sent pickled to  London  and about barrels of salted fish exported to  France Italy  c The fishery on the  Don  is far less considerable  The town of  Aberdeen  is in general well built with granite from the neighboring quarries The best street or rather  place  is the Castlestreet in the middle is an octogon building with neat bas relievos of the Kings of  Scotland  from  James  I to  James  VII The Townhouse makes a good

 from whom the spectator derives the word to  cant  but in all probability  Andrew  canted no  more than the rest of his brethren for he lived in a whining age  In  Charles  the First's time  the word

complete natural history with figures richly illuminated on squares of plated gold on vellum  A Paraphrase on the Revelation by  James  VI with notes in the King's own hand  A fine missal  There is also a very curious silver chain six feet long found in the ruins of the White Fryers at one end is a round flat plate on the other a pearshaped appendage    There are about a hundred and forty students belonging to this college  The grammarschool is a low but neat building  School Hospital  Gordon  's hospital is handsome in front is a good statue of the founder it maintains forty boys children of the inhabitants of  Aberdeen  who are apprenticed at proper ages  The infirmary is a large plain building and sends out between eight and nine hundred cured patients annually  On the side of the Great Bleachery which is common to the town are the publick walks Over a road between the Castlestreet and the river is a very handsome arch which must attract the attention of the traveller  On the east of the town is a work begun by  Cromwel  from whence is a fine view of the sea beneath is a small patch of ground noted for producing very early barley which was then reaping  Prices of

was preserved by the spirit of the Provost at the time of the reformation who armed his people and checked the blind zeal of the populace  The library is large The most remarkable things are  John Trevisa  's translation of  Higden's Polychronicon  in the manuscript excellently wrote and the language very good for that time A very neat  Dutch  missal with elegant paintings on the margin Another of the angels appearing to the shepherds wish one of the men playing on the bagpipes A manuscript catalogue of the old treasury of the college  Hector Boethius  was the first principal of the college and sent for from  Paris  for that purpose on an annual salary of forty marks  Scots  at thirteenpence each The square tower on the side of the college was built by  Cromwel  for the reception of students of which there are about a hundred belonging to the college who lie in it  In Bishop  Elphinston  's hall who was the founder is a picture of Bishop  Dunbar  who finished what the other left

clift above the sea The drawingroom a large and very elegant apartment hangs over it the waves run in wild eddies round the rocks beneath  and the sea fowl clamor above and below forming a strange prospect and singular chorus The place was once desensible there having been a ditch and drawbridge on the accessible side but now both are destroyed  Above five miles south is  Slains  the remains of the old family castle seated strongly on a peninsulated rock but demolished in by  James  VI on the rebellion of the Earl of  Huntly  Near this place are some vast caverns once filled with curious stalactical incrustations but now destroyed in order to be burnt into lime for there is none in this country that usefull commodity being imported from the Earl of  Elgin  's works on the  Firth  of  Forth  Here the shore begins to grow bold and rocky and indented in a strange manner with small and deep creeks or rather immense and horrible chasms The famous  Bullers  of  Buchan  lie about a mile north of  Bowness  Bullers  of  Buchan  are a vast hollow in a rock projecting into the sea open at top with a communication to the sea through a noble natural arch thro' which boats can pass and lie secure in this natural harbor There is a path round the top but in some parts too narrow to walk on with satisfaction as the depth is about thirty fathom with water on both sides being bounded on the north and south by small creeks  Near this is a great insulated rock divided by a narrow and very deep chasm from the land This rock is pierced through midway between the water and the top and in great storms the waves rush through it with vast noise and impetuosity On the  sides as well as those of the adjacent cliffs  Kittiwakes  breed multitudes of  Kittiwakes  Br Zool illustr    tab  xxiii

encouragement finds them a boat Besides these they have little yawls for catching bait at the foot of the rocks Muscles are also much used for bait and many boats loads are brought for that purpose from the mouth of the  Ythen  Of late years a very successfull salmon fishery has been set up in the sandy bays below  Slains  This is performed by long nets carried out to sea by boats a great compass taken and then hawled on shore It is remarked  marked these fish swim against the wind and are much better tasted than those taken in fresh waters  Most of the labor on shore is performed here by the women they will carry as much fish as two men can lift on their shoulders and when they have sold their cargo and emptied their basket will replace part of it with stones they go sixteen miles to sell or barter their fish are very fond of finery and will load their fingers with trumpery rings when they want both shoes and stockings The fleet was the last war supplied with great numbers of men from this and other parts of  Scotland  as well as the army I think near engaged in the general cause and assisted in carrying our glory through all parts of the globe of the former numbers

clay and working it up with water the laborers place on it a large stratum of straw which is trampled into it and made small by horses then more is added till it arrives at a proper consistency when it is used as a plaister and makes the houses very warm The roofs are  sarked i e  covered with inchandhalf deal sawed into three planks and then nailed to the joists on which the states are pinned  The land prospect is extremely unpleasant for no trees will grow here in spite of all the pains that have been taken not but in former times it must have been well wooded as is evident from the numbers of trees dug up in all the bogs The  fame nakedness prevales over great part of this coast even far beyond  Bamiss  except in a few warm bottoms  The corn of this tract is oats and barley of the last I have seen very good close to the edges of the cliffs Rents are paid here partly in cash partly in kind the last is commonly sold to a contractor The land here being poor is set cheap The

beans peas oats and barley were excellent the wheat very good but through the fault of the climate will not ripen till it is late the harvest in these parts being in  October  The plantations are very extensive and reach to the top of the hill of  Knock  but the farther they extend from the bottoms the worse they succeed  The town of  Cullen  is mean yet has about a hundred looms in it there being a flourishing manufacture of linnen and thread of which near fifty thousand pounds worth is annually made  Near this town the Duke of  Cumberland  after his march from  Bamss  joined the rest of his forces from  Straithbogie  and encamped at  Cullen  In a small sandy bay are three lofty spiring rocks formed of slinty masses cemented together very  differently from any stratum in the country These are called the three Kings of  Cullen  A little farther is another vast rock pierced quite through formed of pebbly concretions lodged in clay which had subsided in thick but regular layers  Passed

the powerfull Chieftains  The  Spey  is a dangerous neighbor to  CastleGordon  The  Spey  a large and furious river overflowing very frequently in a dreadfull manner as appears by its ravages far beyond its banks The bed of the river is wide and full of gravel and the channel very shifting  The Duke of  Cumberland  passed this water at  Beily  church near this place when the channel was so deep as to take an officer from whom I had the relation and who was six feet four inches high up to the breast The opposite banks are very high and steep so that had not the Rebels been providentially so insatuated as to neglect opposition  the passage must have been attended with considerable loss  The salmon fishery on this river is very great about seventeen hundred barrels full are caught in

taste The chapterhouse is an octagon the roof supported by a fine single column with neat carvings of coats of arms round the capital There is still a great tower on each side of this cathedral but that in the centre with the spire and whole roof are fallen in and form most awefull fragments mixed with the battered monuments of Knights and Prelates  Boethius  says that  Duncan  who was killed by  Macbeth  at  Inverness  lies buried here Numbers of modern tombstones also crowd the place a proof how difficult it is to eradicate the opinion of local fanctity even in a religion that affects to despise it  About a mile from hence is the castle of  Spinie  Spinie  a large square tower and a vast quantity of other ruined buildings still remain which shews its antient magnificence whilst the

roadside is a vast column three feet ten inches broad and one foot three inches thick the height above ground is twentythree feet below as is said twelve or fifteen On one  side are numbers of rude figures of animals and armed men with colors flying some of the men seemed bound like captives On the opposite side was a cross included in a circle and raised a little above the surface of the stone At the foot of the cross are two gigantic figures and on one of the sides is some elegant fretwork  This is called King  Sueno  's stone and seems to be as Mr  Gordon  Itin Septentr    conjectures

almost round with a narrow strait into it from the sea and a melancholy prospect of the parish of the same name  Inundation of sand  now nearly overwhelmed with sand This strange inundation is still in motion but mostly in the time of a west wind it moves along the surface with an even progression but is stopped by water after which it forms little hills its motion is so quick that a gentleman assured me he had seen an appletree so covered with it in one season as to leave only a few of the green leaves of the upper branches appear above the surface An estate of about l  per ann  has been thus overwhelmed and it is not long since the chimnies of the principal houses were to be seen it began about eighty years ago occasioned by the cutting down the trees and pulling up the bent or

illiterate and enthusiastic teachers of the old times and have taken up the mild method of persuasion instead of the cruel discipline of corporal punishments  Science almost universally flourishes among them and their discourse is not less improving than the table they entertain the stranger at is decent and hospitable Few very few of them permit the bewitchery of dissipation to lay hold of them notwithstanding they allow all the innocent pleasures of others which though not criminal in the layman they know must bring the taint of levity on the churchman They never sink their characters

kingdoms  The young adventurer lodged here the evening preceding the battle distracted with the dissensions among his officers evert when they were at the brink of destruction he seemed incapable of acting could be scarcely persuaded to mount his horse  Inverness  never came into the field of battle as might have been expected from a prince who had his last stake to play but fled ingloriously to the old traitor  Lovat  who I was told did execrate him on hearing that he approached as a fugitive  The Duke of  Cumberland  when he found that the barges of the fleet attended near the shore for the safety of his person in case of a defeat immediately ordered them away to convince his men of the resolution he had taken of either conquering or perishing with them  After descending from the Moor got into a well cultivated country and after riding some time under low but pleasant hills not far from the sea reach  INVERNESS finely seated on a plain  INVERNESS  between the Firth of the same name and the river  Ness  the first from the narrow strait of  Ardersier  instantly widens into a fine bay and again as suddenly contracts opposite  Inverness  at the ferry of  Kessock  the pass into  Rossshire  The town is large and well built and very populous being the last of any note in  North Britain  On the north is  Oliver  's Fort a pentagon but only the form remains to be traced by the ditches and banks Near it is a very considerable rope manufacture On an eminence south of the town is old  Fort George  which was taken and blown up by the Rebels it had been no more than a very antient castle the place where  Boethius  says that  Duncan  was murdered from thence is a most charming view of the  Firth  the passage of  Kessock  the river  Ness  the strange shaped hill of  Tommin heurich  and various groupes of distant mountains  That singular  Tommin  is of an oblong form broad at the base and sloping on all sides towards the top so that it looks like a great ship with its keel upwards Its sides and part of the neighboring plains are planted so it is both an agreeable walk and a fine object It is perfectly detached from any other hill and if it was not for its great size might pass  Its length at top about yards I neglected measuring the base or the height which are both considerable the breadth of the top only yards  for a work of art The view from it is such that no traveller will think his labor lost after gaining the summit  At  Inverness  and I believe at other towns in  Scotland  is an officer called  Dean  of the  Guild  who assisted by a council

absolutely dispose of the ground to the best bidder  Cross the  Ness  on a bridge of seven arches above which the tide flows for about a mile  Proceed north have a fine view of the Firth which now widens again from  Kessock  into a large bay some miles in length The hills slope down to the waterside and are finely cultivated but the distant prospect is of rugged mountains of a stupendous height as if created as guards to the rest of the island from the fury of the boisterous north  Ride close to the wateredge thro' woods of alder pass near several houses of the  Fraziers  and reach  Castle Dunie  Castle Dunie  the site of the house of their chieftain Lord  Lovat  The old house which was very mean was burnt down in but a neat box the residence of the hospitable factor is built in its stead on a high bank well wooded over the pretty river  Bewley  or  Beaulieu  The country for a certain circuit is fertile well cultivated and smiling The bulk of Lord  Lovat  's estate was in these parts the rest to the amount of l  per ann  in  Straitherick  He was a potent chieftain and could raise about men but I found his neighbors spoke as unfavorably of him as his enemies did in the most distant parts of the kingdom His property is one of the annexed estates  i e  settled unalienably on the crown as all the forfeited fortunes in the Highlands are  Forfeited estates  the whole value of which brought in at that time about l  per ann  and those in the Lowlands about the same sum so that the power and interest of a poor twelve thousand  per ann  terrified and nearly subverted the constitution of these powerfull kingdoms  The profits or these estates are lodged in the hands of Trustees who apply their revenue for the founding of schools for the instruction of children in spinning wheels are given away to poor families and flaxseed to farmers Some money is given in aid of the roads and towards building bridges over the torrents by which means a ready intercourse is made to parts before inaccessible to  strangers  The factors or agents of these estates are also allowed all the money they expend in planting  And in a large sum was spent on an  Utopian  project of establishing colonies on the forfeited estates of disbanded soldiers and sailors comfortable houses were built for them land and money given and some lent but the success by no means answered the

the shire of  Cromarty  now a country almost destitute of trees yet in the time of  James  V was covered with timber and overrun with wolves  These animals have been long extinct in  North Britain

between the Firths of  Cromartie  and  Dornoch  is  Ballinagouan  the seat of a gentleman who has most successfully converted his sword into a ploughshare who after a series of disinterested services to his country by clearing the seas of privateers the most unprofitable of captures has applied himself to arts not less deserving of its thanks He is the best farmer and the greatest planter in the

church On the doors and windowshutters were painted as is common in many parts of  North Britain  white tadpolelike figures on a black ground designed to express the tears of the country for the loss of any person of distinction These were occasioned by the affecting end of that amiable pair the young Earl and Countess of  Sutherland  who were lovely in their lives and in their deaths they were not divided for their happiness was interrupted by a very short separation  sanè ubi  idem et maximus et bonestissimus amor est aliquando proestat morte jungi quam vita distrabi  Ride on a plain not far from the sea pass by a small cross called the  Thane  's Cross and not far from thence the spot where an unhappy creature had been burnt if I mistake not in  June  for the imaginary crime of  witchcraft  This is the last instance of these frantic executions in the north of  Scotland  as that in the south was at  Paisly  in where among others a woman young and handsome suffered and with a reply to her enquiring friends worthy a  Roman  matron being asked why she did not make a better defence on her tryal answered  My persecutors have destroyed my honor and my life is not now worth the pains of defending  The last instance of national credulity on this head was the story of the witches of  Thurso  who tormenting for a long time an honest fellow under the usual form of cats at last provoked him so that one night he put them to flight with his broad sword and cut off the leg of one less nimble than the rest on his taking it up to his amazement he found it belonged to a female of his own species and next morning discovered the owner an old hag with only the companion leg to this The horrors of this tale were considerably abated in the place I heard it by an unlucky enquiry made by one in company  viz  In what part would the old woman have suffered had the man cut off the cat's tail But these relations of almost obsolete superstitions must never be thought a reflection on this country as long as any memory remains of the tragical end of the poor people at  Tring  who within a few miles of our capital in fell a sacrifice to the belief of the common people in witches

country abounding in cattle and sends out annually head which sold about this time from l s to l  Lean  per  head These are very frequently without horns and both they and the horses are very small Stags abound in the hills there being reckoned not less than on the  Sutherland  estate which in fact is the greatest part of the county Besides these are Roes Grous black game and Ptarmigans in plenty and during winter multitudes of waterfowl on the coast  Not far from  Dunrobin  is a very entire antiquity of the kind known in  Scotland  by the name of the  Pictish  Castles  Pictish  Castle  and called here  Cairn Lean  or a grey tower that I saw was about yards in circumference round and raised so high above the  ground as to form a considerable mount on the top was an extensive but shallow hollow within were three low concentric galleries at small distances from each other covered above with large stones and the sidewalls were about four or five feet thick rudely made There are generally three of these places near each other so that each may be seen from any one Whether these were the  suffugia hiemi  aut  receptacula frugibus  of the  Picts  as they were of the  Germans  or whether they might not have been used for religious purposes as such hollows have been in  Norway  Worm Monum lib  V  p    I will not pretend to decide if the last I would suppose some of the galleries to be for the priests the others for the victims who were chosen by lot and who might be brought to be sacrificed in the concave area above which was well adapted to retain their blood that was to be sprinkled on the spectators on the posts of their houses and on the sails of their ships†  Kept along the shore northward About a mile from the castle are some small cliffs of freestone  AUG  in one is  Straithleven  Cove an artificial cave with seats and several shallow circular hollows cut withinside At some distance and near the sea are small strata of coal three feet thick dipping to the east  Coal  and found at the depth of about to yards Sometimes it takes fire on the bank which has given it so ill a name that people are very fearfull of taking it aboard their ships I am

promontory on a good road winding up its steep sides and impending in many parts over the sea infinitely more high and horrible than our  Penmaen Mawr  Beneath were numbers of Seals floating on the waves with seafowl swimming among them with great security Observed projecting from one part of the  Ord  far below a small and verdant hill on which tradition says was fought a single combat between an Earl of  Cathness  and a son of the Earl of  Sutherland  while their two  armies looked on from above the first was killed on the spot the last died of his wounds  Beneath this cape are immense caves the resort of Seals  During spring great quantities of Lump fish resort here and are the prey of the Seals as appears from the numbers of their skins which at that season float ashore The Seals at certain times seem visited with a great mortality for at those times multitudes of them are seen dead in the water  and Seafowls the sides and top are chiefly covered with heath and morassy earth which gives it a black and melancholy look Ride over some boggy and dreary moors Pass thro'  Ausdale  a little highland village Descend into a deep bottom covered with alders willows birch and wicken trees to  Langwall  the seat of Mr  Sutherland  who gave me a very hospitable reception The country abounds with Stags and Roes and all sorts of feathered game while the adjacent river brings Salmon

called the Water Mole  Proceed on my journey  AUG  Pass near  Berridale  On a peninsula jutting into the sea is the ruin of the castle between it and the land is a deep chasm where there had been a drawbridge On this castle are stationed in the salmon season persons who are to observe the approach of the fish to the fresh waters  Near  Clathron  is a druidical stone set an end and of a most stupendous size  Saw  Dunbeth  the seat of Mr  Sinclair  Dunbeth  situated on a narrow neck of land on one side impending over the sea on the other over a deep chasm into which the tide flows a small narrow garden with billows beating on three sides fills the rest of the land between the house and the sea Numbers of old castles in this county have the same tremendous situation On the west side of this house are a few rows of tolerable trees the only trees that I saw from  Berridale  to the extremity of  Cathness  But vast quantity of subterraneous timber in all the moors Near  Dunbeth  is an entire  Picts  castle with the hollow in the top and is called the  Bourg  of  Dunbeth  On the right inland are the small remains of  Knackennan  castle built by an Earl of  Cathness  From these parts

morass now covered with sand finely turfed over so in this instance the land has been obliged by the instability of the sand The old castle of  Keiss  is seated on a rock with a good house of the same name near it  Near  Freswick  castle the cliffs are very lofty the strata that compose them lie quite horizontally in such thin and regular layers and so often intersected by fissures as to appear like masonry Beneath are great insulated columns called here  Stacks  composed of the same sort of natural masonry as the cliffs many of them are hollowed quite thro' so as to form most magnificent arches which the sea rushes thro' with vast noise and impetuosity affording a most august piece of scenery to such who are steady enough to survey it from the narrow and almost impending paths  Freswick  castle is seated on a narrow rock projecting into the sea  Freswick  castle  with just room enough for it to stand on the access to it while the drawbridge was in being was over a deep chasm cut thro' the little isthmus that connected it to the main land These dreadful situations are strongly expressive of the jealous and wretched condition of the tyrant owners  Freswick Castle  After riding near  Freswick  bay the second sandy bay in the county pass over a very bad morass and after a few miles travel arrive at  Dungsby  bay  John a Grout  's house is now known only by name The proper name of the bay is  Duncan  's  a low tract  Dungsby  bay  consisting of oatlands and grazing land the  ultima Thule  of Mr  Wallace  whose description it answers in this particular  Quam juxta

narrow little boats I saw lying on the shore  The points of this bay are  Dungsby  head and St  John  's head stretching out into the sea to the east and west forming a pair of horns from the resemblance to which it should seem that this country was antiently styled  Cornuna  From hence is a full view of several of the  Orkney  islands  Orkneys  such as  Flota Waes Ronaldsa Swanna  to the

appearing like a great tower  Passed near the seat of a gentleman not long deceased the last who was believed to be possessed of the  second sight  Second sight  Originally he made use of the pretence in order to render himself more respectable with his clan but at length in spite of fine abilities was made a dupe to his own artifices became possessed with a serious belief of the faculty and for a considerable number of years before his death was made truely unhappy by this strange opinion which originally arose from the following accident A boat of his was on a very tempestuous night at sea his mind filled with anxiety at the danger his people were in furnished him with every idea of the misfortune that really befell them he suddenly starting up pronounced that his men would be drowned for that he had seen them pass before him with wet garments and dropping locks The event was correspondent and be from that time grew confirmed in the reality of spectral predictions  There is another sort of divination called  Sleinanachd  or reading the  spealbone  or the bladebone of a shoulder of mutton well scraped When Lord  London  was obliged to retreat before the Rebels to the isle of

after revolving all that might happen Mr  Forbes  suddenly turning to a window said  All these things may fall out but depend on it all these disturbances will be terminated on this spot  Returned the

been in fear of each other there was between them a drawbridge the first too had an iron door which dropped from above through grooves still visible  Produce of  Cathness  Cathness  may be called an immense morass mixed with some fruitfull spots of oats and barley much coarse grass and here and there some fine almost all natural there being as yet very little artificial At this time was the hay harvest both here and about  Dunrobin  the hay on this rough land is cut with very short scythes and with a brisk and strong stroke The country produces and exports great quantities of  oatmeal  and much whisky is distilled from the barley the great thinness of inhabitants throughout  Cathness  enables them to send abroad much of its productions No wheat had been raised this year in the county and I was informed that this grain is sown here in the spring by reason of the wet and fury of the winters  The county is supposed to send out  Cattle  in some years head of cattle but in bad seasons the farmer kills and salts numbers for sale Great numbers of swine are reared here they are short highbacked longbristled sharp slender and longnosed have long erect ears and most savage looks and are

people are kept here in great servitude and most of their time is given to their Lairds an invincible impediment to the prosperity of this county  Of the ten parishes in  Cathness  only the four that lie S E speak  Erse  all the others speak  English  and that in greater purity than most part of  North Britain  Inoculation is much practised by an ingenious physician Dr  Mackenzie  of  Wick  in this county and also the  Orkneys  At this time a person was employed in the same business in the  Shetlaud  islands  with great success without any previous preparation The success was equally great at  Sanda  a poor isle where there was no sort of fuel but what was got from dried cowdung but in all these places the smallpox is very fatal in the natural way Other diseases in  Cathness  are colds coughs and very frequently palsies  Long days  I came here too late  Besides the missing so singular a phaenomenon I found that the bad weather which begins earlier in the north was setting in I would therefore recommend to any traveller who means to take this distant tour to set out from  Edinburgh  a month sooner than myself  to have any benefit from the great length of days but from  June  to the middle of  July  there is scarce any night for even at what  is called midnight the smallest print may be read so truely did  Juvenal  style these people  Minima contentos nocte  BRITANNOS  On my way between  Thrumster  and  Dunbeth  AUG Gannett  again saw numbers of flocks of  Gannets  keeping due north and the weather being very calm they flew high It has not been observed that they ever

of the two bridges over the waters of  Berridale  and  Langwall  Berridale  and their wooded glens and of the castle of  Berridale  A little up the land is the ruin of  Achcastle  over the sea where the Salmonfishers station themselves to observe the approach of those fish out of the ocean After a tedious ascent up the King's road of four miles gain the top of the  Ord  and lie at  Hemsdale  Revisit the same places till I pass  Dingwall  AUG to  Cross the  Conan  in a boat a very beautifull river not remote from  Castle Braan  Was in this neighborhood informed of other singular customs of the Highlanders  Singular customs  On Newyear's day they burn juniper before their cattle and on the first  Monday  in every quarter sprinkle them with urine  In some parts of the country is a  Beltein  A  Beltein  different from that beforementioned A cross is cut on some sticks which is dipped in pottage and the  Thursday  before  Easter  one of each placed over  the sheepcot the stable or the cowhouse On the st of  May  they are carried to the hill where the  Beltein  is celebrated all decked with wild flowers and after the feast is over replaced over the spots they were taken from These follies are now seldom practised and that with the utmost secrecy for the Clergy are indefatigable in discouraging every species of superstition  In certain places the death of people is supposed to be foretold by the cries and shrieks of  Benshi  or the Fairies wife uttered along the very path where the funeral is to pass and what in  Wales  are called  corps candles  are often imagined to appear and foretell mortality  Marriage customs  The courtship of the Highlander has these remarkable circumstances attending it after privately obtaining the consent of the Fair he formally demands her of the father The Lover and his friends assemble on a hill allotted for that purpose in every parish and one of them is dispatched to obtain permission to wait on the daughter if he is successfull he is again sent to invite the father and his friends to ascend the hill and partake of a whisky cask which is never forgot the Lover advances takes his future Fatherinlaw by the hand and then plights his troth and the Fairone is surrendered up to him During the marriage ceremony great care is taken that dogs do not pass between them and particular attention is payed to the leaving the Bridegroom's leftshoe without buckle or latchet to prevent witches  An old opinion  Gesner  says that the witches made use of toads as a charm  Ut vim coeundi ni sallor in viris tollerent  Gesner de quad ori p  from depriving  priving him on the nuptial nighty of the power of loosening the virgin zone As a test not many years ago a singular custom prevaled in the  western  Highlands the morning after a wedding a basket was fastened with a cord round the neck of the bridegroom by the female part of the company who immediately filled it with stones till the poor man was in great danger of being strangled if his bride did not take compassion on him and cut the cord with a knife given her to use at discretion But such was the tenderness of the  Caledonian  spouses that never was an instance of their neglecting an immediate relief of their good man  Pass near the abby  Founded about by Lord  Patrick Bisset  for the monks of  Vall' ombrosa  of  Beaulieu  a large ruin cross the ferry and again reach  Inverness  Make an excursion ten miles south of  Inverness  to  Moyhall  AUG  Moyhall  pleasantly seated at the head of a small but beautifull lake of the same name full of Trout and  Char  called in the  Erse Tartarkinich  and in the  Scotch  Red Weems This water is about two miles and a half long and half a mile broad adorned with two or three isles prettily wooded Each side is bounded by hills cloathed at the bottom with trees and in front at the distance of thirty miles is the great mountain of  Karn Goran  patched with snow  This place is called  Stasach na gail  or the threshold of the Highlands being a very natural and strongly marked entrance from the north This is the seat of the  Clan Chattan  or the  M  c  Intoshes  Clan Chaltan  once a powerfull people in the year fifteen  hundred toke the field but in scarcc half that number like another  Absalom  their fair mistress was in that year supposed to have stolen their hearts from her  Laird  their chieftain but the severest loyalist must admit some extenuation of their error in yielding to the insinuations of so charming a seducer  Boethius  relates that in his time  Inverness  was greatly frequented by merchants from  Germany  who purchased here the furs of several sorts of wild beasts  Ad  Nessae  lacús longi qvatuor it viginti passum millia lati duodecim latera propter wgenua

yielded a great deal of wheat and other corn and quantities of nuts and apples At present there is a trade in the skins of Deer Roes and other beasts which the Highlanders bring down to the fairs There happened to be one at this time the commodities were skins various necessaries brought in by the Pedlars coarse country cloths cheese butter and meal the last in goatskin bags the butter lapped in cawls or leaves of the broad  alga  or tang and great quantities of birch wood and hazel cut into lengths for carts c which had been floated down the river from  LoughNess  Highland  dress  The fair was a very agreeable circumstance and afforded a most singular groupe of Highlanders in all their motly dresses Their  brecban  or plaid consists of twelve or thirteen yards of a narrow  stuff wrapt round the middle and reaches to the knees is often fastened round the middle with a belt and is then called  brechanseal  but in cold weather is large enough to wrap round the whole body from head to feet and this often is their only cover not only within doors but on the open hills during the whole night It is frequently fastened on the shoulders with a pin often of silver and before with a brotche like the  fibula  of the  Romans  which is sometimes of silver and both large and expensive the old ones have very frequently mottos  The stockings are short and are tied below the knee The  cuoranen  is a sort of laced shoe made of a skin with the hairy side out but now seldom worn The  truish  were worn by the gentry and were breeches and stockings made of one piece  The  fillebeg  i e little plaid also called  kelt  is a sort of short petticoat reaching only to the knees and is a modern substitute for the lower part of the plaid being found to be less cumbersome especially in time of action when the Highlanders used to tuck their  brechan  into their girdle Almost all have a great pouch of badger and other skins with tassels dangling before In this they keep their tobacco and money  Their antient arms were the  Lochaber  ax  Arms  now used by none but the townguard of  Edinburgh  a tremendous weapon better to be expressed by a figure than words  The broadsword and target with the last they covered themselves with the first reached their enemy at a great distance These were their antient  weapons as appears by  Simul constantia simul arte  Britanni  ingentibus gladiis et brevibus  missilia nostrorum vitare vel extutere  Vita Agricolae c  Tacitus  but since the difarming act are scarcely to be met with partly owing to that partly to the spirit of industry now rising among them the Highlanders in a few years will scarce know the use of any weapon  Bows and arrows were used in war as late as the middle of the last century as I find in a manuscript life of Sir  Ewin Cameron  The  dirk  was a sort of dagger stuck in the belt I frequently saw this weapon in the shambles of  Inverness  converted into a batcher's knife being like  Hudibras  's dagger  A serviceable dudgeon Either for fighting or for drudging  The dirk was a weapon used by the antient  Caledonians  for  Dio Cassius  in his account of the expedition of  Severus  mentions it under the name of  Pugio  The  Mattucashlash  or armpit dagger was worn there ready to be used on coming to close quarters These with a pistol stuck in the girdle completely armed the Highlander  Major  who wrote about the year thus describes their arms  Arcum et sagittas latissimum ensim cum parvo balberto pugionem grossum ex solo uno latere scmlentem sed acutjssimum sub zonani semper ferunt Tempore belli loricam  x loris ferreis per totum corpus induunt  Lib I c viii    Piery cross  It will be fit to mention here the method the Chieftains toke formerly to assemble the clans for any military expedition In every clan there is a known place of rendezvous styled  Carn a whin  to which they must resort on this signal A person is sent out full speed with a pole burnt at one end and bloody at the other and with a cross at the top which is called  Croshtairie  the cross of shame or the fiery cross the first from the disgrace they would undergo if they declined appearing the second from the penalty of having fire and sword carried thro' their country in case of refusal The first bearer delivers it to the next person he meets he running full speed to the third and so on In the late rebellion it was sent by some unknown disaffectd hand thro' the county of  Breadalbane  and passed through a tract of thirtytwo miles in three hours but without effect  The women's dress is the  kirch  or a white piece of linnen  Women's dress  pinned over the foreheads of those that are married and round the hind part of the head falling behind over their necks The single women wear only a ribband round their head which they call a snood The  tanac  or plaid hangs over their shoulders and is fattened before with a brotche but in bad weather is drawn over their heads In the county of  Breadalbane  many wear when in high dress a great pleated stocking of an enormous length called  ossan  In other respects their dress resembles that of women of the same rank in  England  but their condition is very different being little better than slaves to our sex  The manners of the native Highlanders may justly be expressed in these words  Character of the Highlanders  indolent to a high degree unless rouzed to war or to any animating amusement or I  May  say from experience to lend any disinterested assistance to the distressed  traveller either in directing him on his way or affording their aid in passing the dangerous torrents of the Highlands hospitable to the highest degree and full of generosity are much affected with the civility of strangers and have in themselves a natural politeness and addrese which often flows from the meanest when left expected Thro' my whole tour I never met with a single instance of national reflection their forbearance proves them to be superior to the meanness of retaliation I fear they pity us but I hope not indiscriminately Are excessively inquisitive after your business your name and other particulars of little consequence to them most curious after the politicks of the world and when they can procure an old newspaper will listen to it with all the avidity of  Shakespear  's blacksmith Have much pride and consequently are impatient of affronts and revengefull of injuries Are decent in their general behaviour inclined to superstition yet attentive to the duties of religion and are capable of giving a most distinct account of the principles of their faith But in many parts of the Highlands their character begins to be more faintly marked they mix more with the world and become daily less attached to their chiefs the clans begin to disperse themselves through different parts of the country finding that their industry and good conduct afford them better protection since the due execution of the laws than any their chieftain can afford and the chieftain tafting the sweets of advanced rents and the benefits of industry damnisses from his table the crowds of retainers the  former instruments of his oppression and freakish tyranny  Most of the antient sports of the Highlanders  Highland  sports  such as archery hunting fowling and Billing are now difused those retained are throwing the  putting  stone or stone of  strength  Cloch neart  as they call it which occasions an emulation who can throw a weighty one the farthest Throwing the  penny  stone which answers to our coits The  shinty  or the striking a ball of wood or of hair this game is played between two parties in a large plain and furnished with clubs whichever side strikes it first to their own goal wins the match  The amusements by their firesides were the telling of tales the wildest and most extravagant imaginable musick was another in former times the harp was the favorite instrument covered with leather and strung with wire  Major  says  Pro musicis instrumentis et musico concentu Lyra sylvestres utuntur cujus chordas ex aere et non ex animaltum intestinis faciunt in qua dulcissine madulantur  but at present is quite lost Bagpipes are supposed to have been introduced by the  Danes  Bagpipes  the oldest are played with the mouth the loudest and most earpiercing of any wind musick the other played with the singers only are of  Irish  origin the first suited the genius of this warlike people rouzed their courage to battle alarmed them when secure and collected them when scattered This instrument is become scarce since the abolition of the power of the chieftains and the more industrious turn of the common people  Vocal musick was much in vogue amongst them and their songs were chiefly in praise of their antient heroes I was told that they still have fragments of the story of  Fingal  and others which they carrol as they go along these vocal traditions are the foundation of the works of  Ossian  Leave  Inverness  AUG  and continue my journey west for some time by the riverside have a fine view of the plain the  Tommin  the town and the distant hills After a ride of about six miles reached  LoughNess  This beautifull lake has a great resemblance to some parts of the lake of  Lucerne  especially towards the east end  and enjoyed along its banks a most romantic and beautifull scenery generally in woods of birch or hazel mixed with a few holly whitethorn aspin ash and oak but open enough in all parts to admit a sight of the water Sometimes the road was strait for a considerable distance and resembled a fine and regular avenue in others it wound about the sides of the hi  ls which overhung the lake the road was frequently cut thro' the rock which on one side formed a solid wall on the other a steep precipice In many parts we were immersed in woods in others they opened and gave a view of the sides and tops of the vast mountains soaring above some of these were naked but in general covered with wood except on the meer precipices or where the grey rocks denied vegetation or where the heath now glowing with purple blossoms covered the surface The form of these hills was very various and irregular either broken into frequent precipices or towering into rounded summits cloathed with trees but not so  Castle Urqhuart  close but to admit a sight of the sky between them Thus for many miles there was no possibility of cultivation yet this tract was occupied by diminutive cattle by Sheep or by Goats the last were pied and lived most luxuriously on the tender branches of the trees The wild animals that possessed this picturesque scene were Stags and Roes black game and Grous and on the summits white Hares and Ptarmigans Foxes are so numerous and voracious that the farmers are sometimes forced to house their Sheep as is done in  France  for fear of the Wolves  It is to me matter of surprize that no mention is made in the Poems of  Ossian  of our greater beasts of prey which must have abounded in his days for the Wolf was a pest to the country so late as the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  and the Bear existed there at lest till the year when a  Gordon  for killing a fierce Bear was directed by the King to carry three Bears heads in his banner Other native animals are often mentioned in several parts of the work and in the five little poems on night compositions of as many Bards every modern  British  beast of chace is enumerated the howling Dog and howling Fox described yet the howling Wolf omitted which would have made the Bards night much more hideous    The north side of  LoughNess  is far less beautifull than the south In general the hills are less high but very steep in a very few places covered with brushwood but in general very naked from the Hiding of the strata down their sloping sides About the middle is Castle  Urqhuart  Castle  Urqhuart  a fortress founded on a rock projecting into the lake and was said to have been the seat of the once powerfull  Cummins  Near it is the broadest part of the Lough occasioned by a bay near the castle  Above is  GlenMoriston  and east of that  StraithGlas  or the  Chisolm  's country in both of which  are forests of pines where that rare bird the Cock of the Wood is still to be met with At  GlenMoriston  is a manufacture of linnen where forty girls at a time are taught for three months to spin and then another forty taken in there are besides six looms and all supported out of the forseited lands  Above is the great mountain  Meal Fourvounich  the first land sailors make from the east sea on the top is a lake said to be fathoms deep  I was informed that in that neighborhood are glens and cascades of surprising beauty but my time did not permit me to visit them  Dined at a poor inn near the  General's Hut  or the place where General  Wade  resided when he inspected the great work of the roads and gave one rare example of making the soldiery usefull in time of peace Near is a fine glen covered at the bottom with wood through which runs a torrent rising southward The country also is prettily varied with woods and cornfields  Fall of  Fyers  About a mile farther is the fall of  Fyers  a vast cataract in a darksome glen of a stupendous depth the water darts far beneath the top thro' a narrow gap between two rocks then precipitates above forty feet lower into the bottom of the chasm and the foam like a great cloud of smoke rises and fills the air The sides of this glen are vast precipices mixed with trees overhanging the water through which after a short space the waters discharge themselves into the lake  About half a mile south of the first fall is another passing through a narrow chasm whose sides  Upper Fall of Tyers  it has undermined for a considerable way over the gap is a true  Alpine  bridge of the bodies of trees covered with sods from whole middle is an awefull view of the water roaring beneath  At the fall of  Fyers  the road quits the side of the lake and is carried for some space through a small vale on the side of the river  Fyers  where is a mixture of small plains of corn and rocky hills Then succeeds a long and dreary moor a tedious ascent up the mountain  Seewhinnin  or  Cummin  's Seat whose summit is of a great height and very craggy Descend a steep road leave on the right  LoughTaarf  a small irregular piece of water decked with little wooded isles and abounding with  Char  After a second steep descent reach  Fort Augustus  Its  Erse  name is  Kilwhinnin  or the burialplace of the  Cummins  It lies on the road to the Isle of  Skie  which is about miles off but on the whole way there is not a place sit for the reception of man or horse  a small fortress  Fort Augusius  seated on a plain at the head of  LoughNess  between the rivers  Taarf  and  Oich  the last is considerable and has over it a bridge of three arches The fort consists of four bastions within is the Governor's house and barracks for men it was taken by the Rebels in who immediately deserted it after demolishing as much as they could  LoughNess  is twentytwo miles in length  LoughNess  the breadth from one to two miles except near Castle  Urqbuart  where it swells out to three The depth is very great opposite the rock called the  Horseshoe  near the west end it has been found to be fathoms From an eminence near the fort is a full view of its whole extent for it is perfectly  strait running from east to west with a point to the south The boundary from the fall of  Fyers  is very steep and rocky which obliged General  Wade  to make that  detour  from its banks partly on account of the expence in cutting through so much solid rock partly through an apprehension that in case of a rebellion the troops might be destroyed in their march by the tumbling down of stones by the enemy from above besides this a prodigious arch must have been slung over the Glen of  Fyers  This lake  Never freezes  by reason of its great depth never freezes and during cold weather a violent steam rises from it as from a furnace Ice brought from other parts and put into  LoughNess  instantly thaws but no water freezes sooner than that of the lake when brought into a house Its water is esteemed very falubrious so that people come or send thirty miles for it old Lord  Lovat  in particular made constant use of it But it is certain whether it be owing to the water or to the air of that neighborhood that for seven years the garrison of Fort  Augustus  had not lost a single man  The fish of this lake are Salmon which are in season from  Christmas  to  Midsummer  Trouts of about lb weight Pikes and Eels During winter it is frequented by Swans and other wild fowls  The greatest rise of water in  LoughNess  is fourteen feet The lakes from whence it receives its supplies are  LoughOich LouchGarrie  and  LoughQuich  There is but very little navigation on it the only vessel is a gally belonging to the fort to bring the stores from the east end the river  Ness  being too shallow for navigation  It is violently agitated by the winds  Its agitations in  and at times the waves are quite mountainous  November  st at the same time as the earthquake at  Lisbon  these waters were affected in a very extraordinary manner they rose and flowed up the lake from east to west with vast impetuosity and were carried above yards up the river  Oich  breaking on its banks in a wave near three feet high then continued ebbing and flowing for the space of an hour but at eleven o'clock a wave greater than any of the rest came up the river broke on the north side and overflowed the bank for the extent of feet A boat near the  General's Hut  loaden with brushwood was thrice driven ashore and twice carried back again but the last time the rudder was broken the wood forced out and the boat filled with water and left on shore At the same time a little isle in a small lough in  Badenoch  was totally reversed and slung on the beach But at both these places no agitation was felt on land  Rode to the Castle of  Tordown  SEPT Castle of  Tordown  a rock two miles west of Fort  Augustus  on the summit is an antient fortress The face of this rock is a precipice on the accessible side is a strong dyke of loose stones above that a ditch and a little higher a terrass supported by stones on the top a small oval area hollow in the middle round this area for the depth of near twelve feet are a quantity of stones strangely cemented with almost vitrified matter and in some places quite turned into black  scoria  the stones were generally granite mixed with a few gritstones of a kind not found nearer the place than miles Whether this was the antient site of someforge  forge of whether the stones which form this fortress  I was informed that at  Arisaig  is an old castle formed of the same materials  had been collected from the strata of some  Vulcano  for the vestiges of such are said to have been found in the Highlands I submit to farther enquiry  From this rock is a view of  Benki  a vast craggy mountain above  GlenGarrie  's country Towards the south is the high mountain  Coryarich  the ascent from this side is nine miles but on the other into  Badenoch  is very rapid and not above one the road being for the ease of the traveller cut in a zigzag fashion People often perish on the summit of this hill which is frequently visited during winter with dreadfull storms of snow  After a short ride westward along the plain  SEPT  reach  LoughOich  a narrow lake the sides prettily indented and the water adorned with small wooded isles  GlenGarrie  On the shore is  GlenGarrie  the seat of Mr  M'Donald  almost surrounded with wood and not far distant is the ruin of the old castle This lake is about four miles long the road on the south side is excellent and often carried through very pleasant woods  After a small interval arrive on the banks of  LoughLochy  LoughLochy  a fine piece of water fourteen miles long and from one to two broad The distant mountains on the north were of an immense height those on the south had the appearance of fine sheepwalks The road is continued on the side of the lake about eight miles On the opposite shore was  Acbnacarrie  once the seat of  Cameron  of  Lochiel  but burnt in He was esteemed by all parties the honestest and most sensible man of any that embarked in the pernicious and absurd attempt of that and the preceding year By his influence he prevented the Rebels from committing several excesses and even saved the city of  Glasgow  from being plundered when their army returned out of  England  irritated with their disappointment and enraged at the loyalty that city had shewn The Pretender came to him as soon as ever he landed  Lochiel  seeing him arrive in so wild a manner and so unsupported entreated him to desist from an enterprize from which nothing but certain ruin could result to him and his partizans The Adventurer grew warm and reproached  Lochiel  with a breach of promise This affected him so deeply that he instantly went and took a tender and moving leave of his lady and family foreseeing he was on the point of parting with them for ever The income of his estate was at that time as I was told not above  per ann  yet he brought fourteen hundred men into the field  The waters of this lake form the river  Lochy  and discharge themselves into the western sea as those of  LoughOich  do through  LoughNess  into the eastern About the beginning of this lake enter  Lochaber  So called from a lake not far from Fort  William  near whose banks  Banque  was said to have been murthered  stop at  Lowbridge  a poor house  Lochaber  travel over a black moor for some miles see abundance of cattle but scarce any corn Cross  Highbridge  a fine bridge of three arches flung over the torrent  Spean  founded on rocks two of  the arches are feet high This bridge was built by General  Wade  in order to form a communication with the country These publick works were at first very disagreeable to the old Chieftains it lessened their influence greatly for by admitting strangers among them their clans were taught that the Lairds were not the first of men But they had another reason much more solid  Lochaber  had been a den of thieves and as long as they had their waters their torrents and their bogs in a state of nature they made their excursions could plunder and retreat with their booty in full security So weak were the laws in many parts of  North Britain  till after the late rebellion that no stop could be put to this infamous practice A contribution called the  black meal  was raised by several of these plundering chieftains over a vast extent of country whoever payed it had their cattle ensured but those who dared to refuse were sure to suffer Many of these freebooters were wont to insert an article by which they were to be released from their agreement in case of any civil commotion thus at the breaking out of the last rebellion a  M'Gregor  Who assumed the name of  Graham  who had with the strictest honor till that event preserved his friends cattle immediately sent them word that from that time they were out of his protection and must now take care of themselves  Barrisdale  was another of this class chief of a band of robbers who spread terror over the whole country but the Highlanders at that time esteemed the open theft of cattle or the making a  spreith  as  they called it by no means dishonorable and the young men considered it as a piece of gallantry by which they recommended themselves to their mistresses On the other side there was often as much bravery in the pursuers for frequent battles ensued and much blood has been spilt on those occasions They also shewed great dexterity in tracing the robbers not only through the boggy land but over the firmest ground and even over places where other cattle had passed knowing well how to distinguish the steps of those that were wandering about from those that were driven hastily away by the Freebooters  From the road had a distant view of the mountains of  Arisaig  beyond which were  Moydart Kinloch  c At the end of  Lough Shiel  the Pretender first set up his standard in the wildest place that imagination can frame The inhabitants of this country are mostly Papists and here the strength of the rebellion lay  Pass by the side of the river  Lochy  now considerable  Inverlochy  See  Inverlochy Castle  with four large round towers  The largest is called  Cummin  's tower These towers so greatly resemble those built by the same monarch in  North Wales  that I scarce hesitate to attribute this castle to him By several accounts it appears that there had been a castle on the same spot built many centuries prior to this ruin and it is also asserted that the league between  Charlemagne  and  Achaius  King of  Scotland  was signed by the latter in it  which by the mode of building seems to have been the work of the  English  in the time of  Edward  I who laid large fines on the  Scotch  Barons for the purpose of erecting new castles Reach  Fort William  built in King  William  's reign as was a small town near it called  Maryborough  in honor of his Queen but prior to that had been a small fortress erected by order of  Cromwel  with whose people the famous Sir  Ewen Cameron  Who is said to have killed last Wolf in  Scotland  about the year  had numerous contests The present fort is a triangle has two bastions and is capable of admitting a garrison of eight hundred men It was well defended against the Rebels in who raised the siege with much disgrace The fort lies on a narrow arm of the sea called  Lochyell  which extends some miles higher up the country making a bend to the north and extends likewise westward towards the isle of  Mull  near twentyfour  Scotch  miles  This fort on the west and  Fort Augustus  in the centre and  Fort George  on the east  The Chain  form what is called the  chain  from sea to sea This space is called  Glenmore  or the great Glen which including water and land is almost a level of seventy miles There is in fact but little land but what is divided by firth lough or river except the two miles which lie between  Lough Oich  and  Lough Lochy  By means of  Fort George  all entrance up the Firth towards  Inverness  is prevented  Fort Augustus  curbed the inhabitants midway and  Fort William  is a check to any attempts on the west Detahments are made from all these garrisons to  Inverness Bernera  barracks opposite to the Isle of  Skie  and Castle  Duart  in the Isle of  Mull  I was informed that coal has been lately discovered in this island What advantage may not this prove in establishments of manufacture in a country just rouzed from the lap of indolence  Other  small parries ate also scattered in huts throughout the country to prevent the stealing of castle  Fort William  is surrounded by vast mountains which occasion almost perpetual rain the loftiest are on the south side  Benevish  soars above the rest  Benevish  and ends as I was told in a point at this time concealed in mist whose height from the sea is said to be yards As an antient  Briton  I lament the disgrace of  Snowdon  once esteemed the highest hill in the island but now must yield the palm to a  Caledonian  mountain But I have my doubts whether this might not be rivaled or perhaps surpassed by others in the same country for example  Ben y bourd  a central hill from whence to the Tea there is a continued and rapid descent of seventy miles as may be seen by the violent course of the  Dee  to  Aberdeen  But their height has not yet been taken which to be done fairly must be from the sea  Benevish  as well as many others harbor snow throughtout the year  The bad weather which reigned during my stay in these parts prevented me from visiting the celebrated parallel roads in  GlenRoy  As I am unable to satify the curiosity of the Reader from my own observation I shall deliver in the Appendix  No  III  the informations I could collect relating to these amazing works  The great produce of  Lochaber  is cattle  Trade of  Lochabers  that district alone fends out annually head but if a portion of  Invernessshire  is included of which this properly is part the number is There are  also a few horses bred here and a very few sheep but of late several have been imported Scarce any arable land for the excessive wet which reigns here almost totally prevents the growth of corn and what little there is fit for tillage sets at ten shillings an acre The inhabitants of this district are therefore obliged for their support to import six thousand bolls of oatmeal annually which cost about l the rents are about l  per ann  the return for their cattle is about the horses may produce some trifle so that the tenants must content themselves with a very scanty subsistence without the prospect of saying the lest against unforeseen accidents The rage of raising rents has reached this distant country in  England  there may be reason for it in a certain degree where the value of lands is encreased by accession of commerce and by the rise of the price of provisions but here contrary to all policy the great men begin at the wrong end with squeezing the bag before they have helped the poor tenant to fill it by the introduction of manufactures In many of the isles this already shews its unhappy effect and begins to depopulate the country for numbers of families have been obliged to give up the strong attachment the  Scots  in general have for their country and to exchange it for the wilds of  America  The houses of the peasants in  Lochaber  are the most wretched that can be imagined framed of upright poles which are wattled the roof is formed of boughs like a  wigwam  and the whole is covered with sods so that in this moist climate  their cottages have a perpetual and much finer verdure than the rest of the country  Salmons are

a river bounded on both sides with vast mountains among whose winding bottoms the tide rolled in with solemn majesty The scenery begins to grow very romantic on the west side are some woods of birch

the little village of  KinlochLeven  on most excellent minced stag the only form I thought that animal good in  Near this village is a single farm fourteen miles long which sets for only  per ann  and from the nature of the soil perhaps not very cheap  Saw here a  Quern  A Quern  a sort of portable mill made of two stones about two feet broad thin at the edges and a little thicker in the middle In the centre of the upper stone is a hole to pour in the corn and a peg by way of handle The whole is placed on a cloth the grinder pours the corn into the hole with one hand and with the other turns round the upper stone with a very rapid motion while the meal runs out at the sides on the cloth This is rather preserved as a curiosity being much out of use at present Such are supposed to be the same with what are common among the  Moors  being the simple substitute of a mill  Immediately after leaving  KinlochLeven  the mountains soar to a far greater height than before the sides are covered with wood and the bottoms of the glens filled with torrents that roar amidst the loose stones After a ride of two miles begin to ascend the  black mountain  The  black mountain  in  Argyleshire  on a steep road which continues about three miles almost to the summit and is certainly the highest publick road in  Great Britain  On the other side  the descent is scarce a mile but is very rapid down a zigzag way Reach the  King  's house seated in a plain it was built for the accommodation of His Majesty's troops in their march through this desolate country but is in a manner unfurnished  Pass near  LoughTutta  a long narrow piece of water with a small pinewood on its side A few weatherbeaten pines and birch appear scattered up and down and in all the bogs great numbers of roots that evince the forest that covered the country within this half century These were the last pines which I saw growing spontaneously in  North Britain  The pineforests are become very rare I can enumerate only those on the banks of  LoughRaynach  at  Invercauld  and  Braemar  at  Coygach  and  DirryMonach  the first in  Straithnavern  the last in  Sutherland  Those about  LoughLoyn GlenMoriston  and  StraithGlas

Strom Sondmor    Most of this long day's journey from the  black mountain  was truly melancholy almost one continued scene of dusky moors without arable land trees houses or living creature for numbers of miles  The roads are excellent but from  Fort William  to  KinlochLeven  very injudiciously planned often carried far about and often so steep as to be scarce surmountable whereas had the engineer followed the track used by the inhabitants those inconveniences would have been avoided  These roads by rendering the highlands accessible contributed much to their present improvement and were owing to the industry of our soldiery they were begun in  Vide p    under the directions of Gen  Wade  who like another  Hannibal  forced his way through rocks supposed to have been unconquerable many of them hang over the mighty lakes of the country and formerly afforded no other road to the natives than the paths of sheep or goats where even the Highlander crawled with difficulty and kept himself from tumbling into the far subjacent water by clinging to the plants and bushes of the rock Many of these rocks were too hard to yield to the pickax and the miner was obliged to subdue their obstinacy with gunpowder and often in places where nature had denied him footing and where he was forced to begin his labors suspended from above by ropes on the face of the horrible  precipice The bogs and moors had likewise their difficulties to overcome but all wore it length constrained to yield to the perseverence of our troops  In some places I observed that after the manner of the  Romans  they left engraven on the rocks the names of the regiment each party belonged to who were employed in these works nor were they less worthy of being immortalized than the  Vexillatio  's of the  Roman  legions for civilization was the consequence of the labors of both  These roads begin at  Dunkeld  are carried on thro' the noted pass of  Killicrankie  by  Blair  to  Dalnacardoch Dalwhinie

Black Mountain  by the King's house to  Teindrum  and from thence by  Glenurqhie  to  Inveraray  and so along the beautifull boundaries of  LoughLomond  to its extremity  Another road begins near  Crief  passes by  Aberfeldy  crosses the  Tay  at  Taybridge  and unites with the other road at  Dalnacardoch  and from  Dalwhinie  a branch passes through  Badenoch  to  Inverness  These are the principal military roads but there may be many others I may have overlooked  Rode through some little vales by the side of a small river and from the appearance of fertility have some relief from the dreary scene of the rest of the day Reach  Tyendrum  a small village The inn is seated the highest of any house in  Scotland  Tyendrum  The  Tay  runs  east and a few hundred yards further is a little

of a narrow vale abounding with cattle yet destitute both of arable land and meadow but the beasts pick up a sustenance from the grass that springs up among the heath The country opens on approaching  GlenUrqhie  GlenUrqhie  a pretty vally well cultivated fertile in corn the sides adorned with numbers of pretty groves and the middle watered by the river  Urqhie  the church is seated on a knowl in a large isle formed by the river the  Manse  or minister's house is neat and his little demesn is decorated in the most advantageous places with seats of turf indicating the content and satisfaction of

representations of the chase on others elegant fretwork and on one said to be part of the coffin of a  M'Gregor  is a fine running pattern of follage and flowers and excepting the figures all in good

is the castle of  Kilchurn  Castle of  Kilchurn  which had been inhabited by the present Lord  Breadalbane  's grandfather The great tower was repaired by his Lordship and garrisoned by him in for the service of the government in order to prevent the Rebels from making use of that great pass cross the kingdom but is now a ruin having lately been struck by lightening  At a place called  Hamilton  's Pass in an instant burst on a view of the lake which makes a beautifull appearance  LoughAw  is about a mile broad and shews at lest ten miles of its length This water is prettily varied with isles some so small as meerly to peep above the surface yet even these are tufted with trees some are large enough to afford hay and pasturage and in one called  Inchhail  are the  remains of a convent  The country people are still fond of burying here Insula  interments are said to owe their origin to the fear people had of having their friends corpses devoured by woles on the main land  On  Fr  Elan

to  Clachan  is a common  Erse  phrase for going to church  Pass between hills finely planted with several sorts of trees such as  Weymouth  pines c and after a picturesque ride reach  Inveraray  Inveraray  the castle the principal seat of the Dukes of  Argyle  chief of the  Campbells  was built by Duke  Archibald  is quadrangular with a round tower at each corner and in the middle rises a square one glazed on every side to give light to the staircase and galleries and has from without a most disagreeable effect In the attic story are eighteen good bed chambers the groundfloor was at this time in a manner unfurnished but will have several good apartments The castle is built of a coarse  lapis  ll  ris  brought from the other side of  LoughFine  and is the same kind with that found in  Norway  of which the King of  Denmark  's palace at  Copenhagen  is built Near the new castle are some remains of the old  This place will in time be very magnificent but at present the space between the front and the water is disgraced with the old town composed of the most wretched hovels that can be imagined The founder of the castle designed to have built a new founder on the west side of the little bay the house stands on he finished a few houses a customhouse and an excellent inn his death interrupted the completion of the plan which when brought to perfection will give the place a very different appearance to what it now bears  From the top of the great rock  Duniquaich  is a fine view of the castle the lawn sprinkled with fine trees the hills covered with extensive plantations a country fertile in corn bordering the Lough  and the Lough itself covered with boats The trees on the lawn about the castle are said to have been planted by the Earl of  Argyle  they thrive greatly for I observed beech from nine to twelve feet and a half in girth pines nine and a lesser maple between seven and eight  But the busy scene of the herringfishery gave no small improvement to the magnificent environs of  Inveraray  Every evening  The finery is carried on in the night the herring being then in motion  some hundreds of boats in a manner covered the surface of  LoughFine  an arm of the sea which from its narrowness and from the winding of its shores has all the beauties of a freshwater lake on the weekdays the chearfull noise of the bagpipe and dance eechoes from on board on the sabbath each boat approaches the land and psalmody and devotion divide the day for the common people of the north are disposed to be religious having the example before them of a gentry untained by luxury and dissipation and being instrusted by a clergy who are active in their duty and who preserve respect amids all the disadvantages of a narrow income  The length of  LoughFine  LoughFine  from the eastern end to the point of  Lamond  is above thirty  Scotch  mises but its breadth scarce two measured the depth from sixty to seventy fathoms  Herrings  It is noted for the vast shoals of herrings that appear here in  July  and continue till  January  The highest season is from  September  to  Christmas  when near six hundred  boats with four men in each are employed A chain of nets is used for several are united of a hundred fathoms in length As the herrings swim at very uncertain depths so the nets are sunk to the depth the shoal is found to take the success therefore depends much on the judgement or good fortune of the fishers in taking their due depths for it often happens that one boat will take multitudes while the next does not catch a single fish which makes the boatmen perpetually enquire of each other about the depth of their nets These are kept up by buoys to a proper pitch the ropes that run through them are fastened with pegs and by drawing up or letting out the rope after taking out the pegs they adjust their situation and then replace them Sometimes the fish swim in twenty fathom water sometimes in fifty and oftentimes even at the bottom  It is computed that each boat gets about l in the season The fish are either salted and packed in barrels for exportation or sold fresh to the country people two or three hundred horses being brought every day to the waterside from very distant parts A barrel holds herrings if they are of the best kind at a medium but if more for sometimes a barrel will hold they are reckoned very poor The present price l s  per  barrel but there is a drawback of the duty on salt for those that are exported  The great rendezvous of vessels for the fishery off the western isles is at  Cambeltown  in  Cantyre  where they clear out on the th of  September  and sometimes three hundred busses are seen there at a time  they must return to their different ports by  January  th where they ought to receive the praemium of l s  per  tun of herrings but it is said to be very ill paid which is a great discouragement to the fishery  The herrings of  LoughFine  are as uncertain in their migration as they are on the coast of  Wales  They had for numbers of years quitted that water but appeared again there within these dozen years Such is the case with the loughs on all this western coast not but people despair too soon of finding them from one or two unsuccessfull tryals in the beginning of the season perhaps from not adjusting their nets to the depth the fish happen then to swim in but if each year a small vessel of two was sent to make a thorough tryal in every branch of the sea on this coast they would undoubtedly find shoals of fish in one or other  Tunnies  Tunnies  Br Zool illustr    called here  MackrelSture  are very frequently caught in the herring season which they follow to prey on They are taken with a strong iron hook fastened to a rope and baited with a herring as soon

arches upon the  Aray  in front of the castle and kept riding along the side of the Lough for about seven miles saw in one place a shoal of herrings close to the surface perfectly piled on one another with a flock of Gulls busied with this offered booty  After quitting the waterside the road is carried for a considerable way through the bottoms of naked deep and gloomy glens Ascend a very high pass with a little lough on the top Reach the end of  LoughLong  another narrow arm of the sea bounded by highhills and after a long course terminates in the  Firth  of  Clyde  Near this place see a house

well boast of its waters  Review of the Lakes  for so short a ride as thirty miles presents the traveller with the view of four most magnificent pieces  LoughAw LoughFine LoughLong  and  LoughLomond  Two indeed are of saltwater but by their narrowness give the idea of freshwater lakes It is an idle observation of travellers that seeing one is the same with seeing all of these superb waters for almost every one I visited has its proper characters  LoughLeven  is a broad expanse with isles and cultivated shores  LoughTay  makes three bold windings has steep but sloping shores cultivated in many parts and bounded by vast hills  LoughRaynach  is broad and strait has more wildness about it with a large natural pine wood on its southern banks  Lough Tumel  is narrow confined by the sloping sides of steep hills and has on its western limits a flat rich woody country and is watered by a most serpentine stream  The  Lough  of  Spinie  is almost on a flat and its sides much indented  LoughMoy  is small and has soft features on its banks amidst rude environs  LoughNess  is strait and narrow its shores abound with a wild magnificence lofty precipitous and wooded and has all the greatness of an  Alpine  lake  LoughOich  has lofty mountains at a small distance from its borders the shores indented and the water decorated with isles  LoughLochy  wants the isles its shores slope and several straiths terminate on its banks  LoughAw  is long and waving its little isles tusted with trees and just appearing above the water its two great seeds of water at each extremity and its singular lateral discharge near one of them sufficiently mark this great lake  LoughLomond  LoughLomond  the last the most beautifull of the  Caledonian  lakes The first view of it from  Tarbat  presents an extensive serpentine winding amidst lofty hills on the north barren black and rocky which darken with their shade that contracted part of the water Near this gloomy tract beneath  Craig Roston  M  c  Gregors  was the principal seat of the  M  c  Gregors  a murderous clan infamous for excesses of all kinds it length for a horrible massacre of the  Colquhuns  or  Cabouns  in were proscribed and hunted down like wild beasts their very name suppressed by act of council so that the remnant now dispersed like  Jews  dare not even sign it to any deed Their posterity are still said to be distinguished among the clans in which they have incorporated  themselves not only by the redness of their hair but by their still retaining the mischievous disposition of their ancestors  On the west side the mountains are cloathed hear the bottoms with woods of oak quite to the water edge their summits lofty naked and craggy  On the east side the mountains are equally high but the tops form a more even ridge parallel to the lake except where  BenLomond  Its height is feets  like  Saul  amidst his companions overtops the rest The upper parts were black and barren the lower had great marks of fertility or at left of industry for the yellow corn was finely contrasted with the verdure of the groves intermixed with it  This eastern boundary is part of the  Grampian  hills  Grampian  hills  which extend from hence through the counties of  Perth Angus Mearns  and  Aberdeen  They take their name from only a single hill the  Mons Grampius  of  Tacitus  where  Galgacus  waited the approach of  Agricola  and where the battle was fought so fatal to the brave  Caledonians  Antiquarians have not agreed upon the particular spot but the able Mr  Gordon  Itin Septent    places it near  Comerie  at the upper end of  Straithern  at a place to this day called  Galgachan Moor  But to return  The road runs sometimes through woods at others is exposed and naked in some so steep as to require the support of a wall the whole the work of the soldiery blessed exchange of instruments of destruction for those that give safety to the traveller and a polish to the once inaccessible native  A great headland covered with trees separates the first scene from one totally different On passing this cape an expanse of water bursts at once on your eye varied with all the softer beauties of nature Immediately beneath is a flat covered with wood and corn beyond the headlands stretch far into the water and consist of gentle risings many have their surfaces covered with wood others adorned with trees loosely scattered either over a fine verdure or the purple bloom of the heath Numbers of islands are dispersed over the lake of the same elevated form as the little capes and wooded in the same manner others just peep above the surface and are tusted with trees and numbers are so disposed as to form magnificent vistos between  Opposite  Luss  at a small distance from shore is a mountainous isle almost covered with wood is near half a mile long and has a most fine effect I could not count the number of islands but was told there are twentyeight the largest two miles long and stocked with Deer  The length of this charming lake is  Scotch  miles its greatest breadth eight its greatest depth a hundred and twenty fathoms Besides the fish common to the  Loughs  are  Guiniads  called here  Poans  The country from  Luss  A tolerable inn on the borders of the lake  to the southern extremity of the lake continually improves the mountains sink gradually into small hills the land is highly cultivated well planted and well inhabited  I was struck with rapture at a sight so long new to me it would have been without alloy had it not been dashed with the uncertainty whether the mountain virtue hospitality would flourish with equal vigor in the softer scenes I was on the point of entering on for in the  Highlands  every house gave welcome to the traveller  The vale between the end of the lake and  Dunbarton  is unspeakably beautifull very fertile and finely watered by the great and rapid river  Levin  the discharge of the lake which after a short course drops into the Firth of  Clyde  below  Dunbarton  there is scarcely a spot on its banks but what is cultivated with bleacheries plantations and  villas  Nothing can equal the contrast in this day's journey between the black barren dreary glens of the morning ride and the soft scenes of the evening islands worthy of the retreat of  Armida  and which  Rinaldo  himself would have quitted with a sigh  Before I take my last leave of the  Highlands  Entrances into the  Highlands  it would be proper to observe that every entrance into them is strongly marked by nature  On the south the narrow and wooded glen near  Dunkeld  instantly shews the change of country  On the east the craggy pass of Bollitir gives a contracted admission into the  Grampian  hills  On the north the mountains near  LoughMoy  appear very near and form what is properly styled the threshold of the country and on the West the narrow road impending over  LoughLomond  forms a most characteristic entrance to this mountainous tract  But the  Erse  language is not confined within these limits for it is spoken on all sides beyond these mountains On the eastern coast it begins at  Nairn  on the western extends over all the isles It ceases in the north of  Cathness  the  Orkneys  and the  Shetland  islands  In the  Shetland isles  are still some remains of the  Norse  or old  Norwegian  language  but near

small but good old town seated on a plain near the conflux of the  Levin  with the Firth of  Clyde  it consists principally of one large street in form of a crescent On one side is the  Tolbooth  and at the south end the church with a small spire steeple The waites of the town are bagpipes which go about at nine o'clock at night and five in the morning  Its ca  tle  The castle is seated a little south of the town on a twoheaded rock of a stupendous height rising in a strange manner out of the sands and totally detached from every thing else On one of the summits are the remains of an old lighthouse on the other the powder magazine in the hollow between is a large well of excellent water fourteen feet deep The sides of the rocks are immense precipices and often overhang except on the side where the governor's house stands which is defended by walls and a few cannon and garrisoned by a few invalids From its natural strength it was in former times deemed impregnable so that the

town of  Dunbarton  the river  Levin  the Firth of  Clyde  the  Glota  of  Tacitus  here about a mile broad and of the towns of  Greenock  and  Port Glasgow  on the opposite shore The business of this country is the spinning of thread which is very considerable There is also a great salmonfishery  Fish  but in this populous country so great is the demand for them that none can be spared for curing  Gilses  come up the river in  June  and continue in plenty about twenty days and many Salmon Trout are taken from  March  to  July Phinocs  called here Yellow Fins come in  July  and continue about the same space of time as the Gilses the fishermen call them the young of some great Sea Trout During  May Parrs  appear in such numbers in the  Levin  that the water seems quite animated with them There are besides in that river Perch and a few  Poans  At  Dunbarton  I was informed by persons ot credit that Swallows have often been taken in midwinter in a torpid state out of the steeple of the church and also out of a sandbank over the river  Endrick  near  LoughLomond    Pass by the ruins of  Dunglas  castle  SEPT  near the banks of the  Clyde  which meanders finely along a rich plain full of barley and oats and much inclosed with good hedges a rarity in  North Britain  At a distance are some gentle risings interspersed with woods and villas belonging to the citizens of  Glasgow  GLASGOW  The best built of any modern secondrate city I ever saw the houses of stone and in a good taste The principal street runs east and west and is near a mile and a half long but unfortunately is not strait The  Tolbooth  is large and handsome Next to that is the Exchange within is a spacious room with fulllength portraits of all our monarchs since  James  I and an excellent one by  Ramsay  of  Archibald  Duke of  Argyle  in a Judge's robe Before the Exchange is a large equestrian statue of King  William  This is the broadest and finest part of the street many of the houses are built over piazzas but too narrow to be of much service to walkers Numbers of other streets cross this at right angles and are in general well built  Market places  The marketplaces are great ornaments to this city the fronts being done in a very fine taste and the gates adorned with columns of one or other of the orders Some of these markets are for meal greens fish or flesh There are two for the last which have conduits out of several of the pillars so that they are constantly kept sweet and clean  Near the mealmarket is a publick grainary to be filled on any apprehension of scarceness  The guardhouse is in the great street which is kept by the inhabitants who regularly do duty An excellent police is observed here and proper officers attend the markets to prevent any abuses  The old bridge over the  Clyde  consists of eight arches and was built years ago by Bishop  Rea  two others are now building The tide flows three miles higher up the country but at low water is fordable There is a plan for deepening the channel for at present the tide brings up only very small vessels and the ports belonging to this city lie fourteen miles lower at  Port Glasgow  and  Greenock  on the west side of the  Firth  Near the bridge is a large almshouse a vast nailery a stoneware manufacture and a great porter brewery which supplies some part of unindustrious  Ireland  Within fight on the south side are collieries and much coal is exported into the lastmentioned island and into  America  The great imports of this city are tobacco and sugar of the former  Trade  above hogsheads have been annually imported and near again exported into  France  The manufactures here are linnens cambricks  The greatest cambrick manufacture is now at  Paisly  a few miles from this city  lawns tapes sustians and striped linnens so that it already begins to rival  Manchester  and has in point of the conveniency of its ports in respect to  America  a great advantage over it  The college is a large building with a handsome front to the street  College  resembling some of the old colleges in  Oxford Charles  I subscribed towards this work but was prevented by the troubles from paying it but  Cromwell  afterwards fulfilled the design of the royal donor It was founded in by  James  II Pope  Nicholas  I gave the bull but Bishop  Turnbull  supplied the money There are about students belonging to the college  who lodge in the town but the Professors have good houses in the college Young gentlemen of fortune have private tutors who have an eye to their conduct the rest live entirely at their own discretion  The library is a very handsome room with a gallery round it supported by pillars That beneficent nobleman the late Duke of  Chandos  when he visited the college gave l towards building this apartment  Messrs  Robert  and  Andrew Faulis  printers and booksellers to the university have instituted an academy for painting and engraving and like good citizens zealous to promote the welfare and honor of their native place have at vast expence formed a most numerous collection of paintings from abroad in order to form the taste of their  cleves  The printing is a very considerable branch of business and has long been celebrated for the beauty of the types and the correctness of the editions Here are preserved in cases numbers of monumental and other stones  Several have been engraven by the artists of the academy The Provost of the University did me the honor of presenting me with a set  taken out of the walls on the  Roman  stations in this part of the kingdom some are well cut and ornamented most of them were done to perpetuate the memory of the  vexillatio  or party who performed such or such works others in memory of officers who died in the country  The cathedral is a large pile  Churches  now divided into two churches beneath and deep under ground  is another in which is also divine service where the congregation may truely say  clamavi e profundis  the roof is fine made of stone and supported by pillars but the beauty much hurt by the crowding of the pews Near this is the ruin of the castle or Bishop's palace  The new church is a very handsome building with a large elegant porch but the outside is much dissigured by a slender square tower with a pepperbox top and in general the steeples of  Glasgow  are in a remarkable bad taste being in fact no favorite part of architecture with the church of  Scotland  The inside of that just spoken of is most neatly finished supported by pillars and very prettily stuccoed it is one of the very few exceptions to the slovenly and indecent manner in which Presbitery keeps the houses of GOD reformation in matters of religion seldom observes mediocrity here it was outrageous for a place of worship commonly neat was deemed to savor of popery but to avoid the imputation of that extreme they run into another for in many parts of  Scotland  our LORD seems still to be worshipped in a stable and

all parties  APPENDIX  NUMBER I Concerning the Constitution of the Church of  Scotland  PResbyterian government in  Scotland  took place after the reformation of popery as being the form of ecclesiastical government most agreeable to the genius and inclinations of the people of  Scotland  When  James  VI succeeded to the crown of  England  it is well known that during his reign and that of his successors of the family of  Stewart  designs were formed of altering the constitution of our civil government and rendering our kings more absolute The establishment of episcopacy in  Scotland  was thought to be one point proper in order to facilitate the execution of these designs Episcopacy was accordingly established at length and continued to be the government of the church till the revolution when such designs subsisting no longer presebyterian government was restored to  Scotland  It was established by act of parliament in and was afterwards secured by an express article in the treaty of union between the two kingdoms of  England  and  Scotland  Among the ministers of  Scotland  there subsists a perfect equality that is no minister considered as an individual has an authoratative jurisdiction over another Jurisdiction is competent for them only when they act in a collective body or as a court of judicature and then there is a subordination of  one court to another or inferiour and superiour courts  The courts established by law are the four following  viz  Church Sessions Presbyteries Provincial Synods and above all a National or General Assembly  A Church Session is composed of the Minister of the parish and certain discreet Laymen who are chosen and ordained for the exercise of discipline and are called Elders The number of these Elders varies according to the extent of the parish Two of them together with the Minister are necessary in order to their holding a legal meeting The Minister always presides in these meetings and is called Moderator but has no other authority but what belongs to the  Praeses  of any other court The  Church Session is appointed for inspecting the morals of the parishioners and managing the funds that are appropriated for the maintainance of the poor within their bounds When a person is convided of any instance of immoral conduct or of what is inconsistent with his christian profession the Church Session inflicts some ecclesiastical censure such as giving him an admonition or rebuke or if the crime be of a gross and publick nature they appoint him to profess his repentance in face of the whole congregation in order to make satisfaction for the publick offence The highest church censure is excommunication which is seldom inflicted but for contumacy or for some very atrocious crime obstinately persisted in In former times there were certain civil pains and penalties which followed upon a sentence of excommunication  but by a  British  statute these are happily abolished The church of  Scotland  addresses its censures only to the consciences of men and if they cannot by the methods of persuasion reclaim offenders they think it inconsistent with the spirit of true religion to have recourse to compulsive methods such as temporal pains and penalties  If the person thinks himself aggrieved by the Church Session it is competent for him to seek redress by entering an appeal to the Presbytery which is the next superiour court In like manner he may appeal from the Presbytery to the Provincial Synod and from the Synod to the Assembly whose sentence is final in all ecelesiastical matters  A Presbytery consists of the Ministers within a certain district and also of one ruling Elder from each Church Session within the district In settling the boundaries of a Presbytery a regard was paid to the situation of the country Where the country is populous and champaign there are instances of thirty Ministers and as many Elders being joined in one Presbytery In mountainous countries where travelling is more difficult there are only seven or eight Ministers in some places fewer in a Presbytery The number of Presbyteries is computed to he about seventy Presbyteries review the procedure of Church Sessions and judge in references and appeals that are brought before them They take trials of candidates for the ministry and if upon such trial they had them duly qualified they license  them to preach but not to dispense the sacraments Such licentiates are called Probationers It is not common for the church of  Scotland  to ordain or confer holy orders on such licentiates till they be presented to some vacant kirk and thereby acquire a right to a benefice  It is the privilege of Presbyteries to judge their own members at least in the first instance They may be judged for herefy that is for preaching or publishing doctrines that are contrary to the publick standard imposed by Act of Parliament and Assembly or for any instance of immoral conduct prosecutions for heresy were formerly more frequent than they are at present but happily a more liberal spirit has gained ground among the Clergy of  Scotland  They think more freely than they did of  old and consequently a spirit of inquiry and moderation seems to be on the growing hand so that prosecutions for herefy are become more rare and are generally looked upon as invidious Some sensible men among the clergy of  Scotland  look upon subscriptions to certain articles and creeds of human composition as a grievance from which they would willingly be delivered  Presbyteries are more severe in their censures upon their own members for any instance of immoral conduct If the person be convicted they suspend him from the exercise of his ministerial office for a limited time but if the crime be of a heinous nature they depose or deprive him of his clerical character so that he is no longer a minister of the church of  Scotland  but forfeits his title to his benefice  and other privileges of the established church However if the person thinks himself injured by the sentence of the Presbytery it is lawful for him to appeal to the Provincial Synod within whose bounds his Presbytery lies and from the Synod he may appeal to the National Assembly Presbyteries hold their meetings generally every month except in remote countries and have a power of adjourning themselves to whatever time or place within their district they shall think proper They chuse their own  Praeses  or Moderator who must be a Minister of their own Presbytery The ruling Elders who sit in Presbyteries must be changed every halfyear or else chosen again by their respective Church Sessions  Provincial Synods are the next superiour courts to Presbyteries and are  composed of the several Presbyteries within the province and of a ruling Elder from each Church Session The ancient dioceses of the Bishops are for the most part the boundaries of a Synod Most of the Synods in  Scotland  meet twice every year in the months of  April  and  October  and at every meeting they chuse their Praeses or Moderator who must be a clergyman of their own number They review the procedure of Presbyteries and judge in appeals references and complaints that are brought before them from the inferiour courts And if a Presbytery shall be found negligent in executing the ecclesiastical laws against any of their members or any other person within their jurisdiction the Synod can call them to account and censure them as they shall see cause  The General Assembly is the supreme court in ecclesiastical matters and from which there lies no appeal As they have a power of making Jaws and canons concerning the discipline and government of the church and the publick service of religion the King sends always a commissioner to represent his royal person that nothing may be enacted inconsistent with the laws of the state The person who represents the King is generally some  Scots  nobleman whom his Majesty nominates annually some time before the meeting of the assembly and is allowed a suitable salary for defraying the expence of this honourable office He is present at all the meetings of the assembly and at all their debates and deliberations After the assembly is constituted he presents his commission and delivers a speech  and when they have finished their business which they commonly do in twelve days he adjourns the assembly and appoints the time and place of their next annual meeting which is generally at  Edinburgh  in the month of  May  The Assembly is composed of Ministers and ruling Elders chosen annually from each Presbytery in  Scotland  As the number of Ministers and Elders in a Presbytery varies so the number of their representatives must hold a proportion to the number of Ministers and Elders that are in the Presbytery The proportion is fixed by laws and regulations for that purpose Each Royal Burgh and University in  Scotland  has likewise the privilege of chusing a ruling Elder to the Assembly All elections must at least be made forty days before the  meeting of the Assembly Their jurisdiction is either constitutive or judicial By the first they have authority to make laws in ecclesiastical matters by the other they judge in references and appeals brought before them from the subordinate courts and their sentences are decisive and final One point which greatly employs their attention is the settlement of vacant parishes The common people of  Scotland  are greatly prejudiced against the law of patronage Hence when a patron presents a candidate to a vacant parish the parishioners frequently make great opposition to the settlement of the presentee and appeal from the inferiour courts to the Assembly The Assembly nowadays are not disposed to indulge the parishioners in unreasonable opposition to presentees On the other hand they are unwilling to  settle the presentee in opposition to the whole people who refuse to submit to his ministry because in this case his ministrations among them must be useless and without effect The Assembly therefore for the most part delay giving sentence in such cases till once they have used their endeavours to reconcile the parishioners to the presentee But if their attempts this way prove unsuccessful they proceed to settle the presentee in obedience to the act of parliament concerning patronages Upon the whole it appears that in the indicatories of the church of  Scotland  there is an equal representation of the Laity as of the Clergy which is a great security to the Laity against the usurpations of the Clergy  The business of every Minister in a parish is to perform religious worship  and to preach in the language of the country to his congregation every  Sunday  and likewise on other extraordinary occasions appointed by the laws and regulations of the church The tendency of their preaching is to instruct their hearers in the essential doctrines of natural and revealed religion and improve these instructions in order to promote the practice of piety and social virtue Of old it was customary to preach upon controverted and mysterious points of divinity but it is now hoped that the generality of the Clergy confine the subject of their preaching to what has a tendency to promote virtue and good morals and to make the people peaceable and useful members of society  Ministers likewise examine their parishioners annually They go to  the different towns and  I must observe that Bishop  Burnet  by birth a  Scotchman  adopted in his diocese the zeal of the church of his native country and its attention to the morals and good conduct of the clergy and their flocks Not content with the usual triennial visitations he every summer during six weeks made a progre's through some district of his diocese preaching and confirming from church to church so that before the return of the triennial visitation he became well acquainted with the behaviour of every incumbent He preached every Sunday in some church of the city of  Salisbury  catechised and instrncted its youth for confirmation was most vigilant and strict in his examination of candidates for holy orders was an invincible enemy to pluralities and of course to nonresidents filled his office with worth and dignity and by his espiscopal merits it is to be hoped may have atoned for the acknowledged blemishes in his biographical character  villages of the parish and in an easy and familiar manner converse with them upon the essential doctrines of religion They make trial of their knowledge by putting questions to them on these heads The adult as well as children are catechised They likewise visit their parishes and inquire into the behaviour of their several parishioners and admonish them for whatever they find blameable in their conduct At  these visitations the Minister inculcates the practice of the relative and social duties and insists upon the necessity of the practice of them And if there happen to be any quarrels among neighbours the Minister endeavours by the power of persuasion to bring about a reconciliation But in this part of their conduct much depends upon the temper prudence and discretion of Ministers who are cloathed with the same passions prejudices and infirmities that other men are  To this sensible account of the Church of  North Britain  I beg leave to add another which may be considered as a sort of supplement and may serve to sling light on some points untouched in the preceding it is the extract from an answer to some queries I sent a worthy correspondent in  the Highlands to whom I am indebted for many sensible communications  To apprehend well the present state of  our  church patronage and mode of settlement we must briefly view this matter from the Reformation At  that  remarkable period the whole temporalities of the church were resumed by the Crown and Parliament and soon after a new maintenance was settled for Ministers in about parishes The patrons of the old splendid Popish livings still claimed a patronage in the newmodelled poor stipends for parish ministers The Lords or Gentlemen who got from the Crown grants of the superiorities and lands of old  abbies  claimed also the patronage of all the churches which were in the gift of those  abbies  during popery The  King  too claimed the old patronage of the  Crown  and those of any  ecclesiaslic corporations  not granted away  Laypatronages were reckoned always a great grievance by the Church of  Scotland  and accordingly from the beginning of the reformation the Church declared against laypatronage and presentations The ecclesiastic laws of acts of assembly confirmed at last by parliament required in order to the settlement of a Minister some concurrence of the congregation of the gentlemen who had property within the cure and of the elders of the parish  The Elders or  Kirk  Session are a number of persons who for their  wisdom piety and knowledge are elected from the body of the people in every parish and continue for life  sese bene gerentibus  to assist the parish Minister in suppressing immoralities and regulating the affairs of the parish Three of these men and a Minister make a quorum and form the lowest of our church courts  Thus matters continued to the year when by act of parliament patronages were  abolished  entirely and the election or nomination of Ministers was committed to the  Kirk  Session or Elders who in those days of universal sobriety and outward appearance at least of religion among the Presbyteriaris were generally the gentlemen of il best condition in the parish who were in communion with the  church After the  restoration  of King  Charles  II along with episcopacy patronages returned yet under the old laws and all debates were finally determinate by the  General Assembly  which even under episcopacy in  Scotland  was the supreme ecclesiastic court Thus they continued till the Revolution when the Presbyterian model was restored by act of parliament  The people chose their own ministers and matters continued in this form till the year when Queen  Anne  's ministry intending to defeat the  Hanover  successon took all methods to harass such as were firmly attached to it which the Presbyterian Gentry and Clergy ever were both from principle and interest An act therefore was obtained  and which is still in force restoring patrons to their power of electing ministers  By this act the King is now in possession of the patronage of above churches out of having not only the old rights of the crown but many patronages acquired at the reformation not yet alienated all the patronages of the  Scots  Bishops and all the patronages of the Lords and Gentlemen forseited in the years and Lords gentlemen and magistrates of burroughs are the patrons of the remaining churches A patron must present a qualified person to a charge within six months of the last incumbent's removal or death otherwise his right falls to the Presbytery  A Presbytery consists of several Ministers and Elders All parishes are annexed to some Presbytery The Presbytery is the second church court and they revise the the acts of the  Kirk  Session which is the lowest Above the Presbytery is the Synod which is a court consisting of several Presbyteries And from all these there lies an appeal to the General Assembly which is the supreme church court in  Scotland  This supreme court consists of the King represented by his Commissioner Ministers from the different Presbyteries and ruling Elders They meet annually at  Edinburgh  enact laws for the good of the church finally determine all controverted elections of Ministers They can prevent a clergyman's transportation from one  charge to another They can find a presentee qualified or unqualified and consequently oblige the patron to present another They can depose from the ministry and every intrant into holy orders becomes bound to submit to the decisions of this court which from the days our reformer  John Knox  has appropriated to itself the titles of The VERY VENERABLE and VERY REVEREND ASSEMBLY of the Church of  Scotland  All the clergymen of our communion are upon a par as to authority We can enjoy no pluralities Nonresidence is not known We are bound to a regular discharge of the several duties of our office The different cures are frequently visited by the Presbytery of the bounds and at these visitations strict enquiry  is made into the life doctrine and diligence of the incumbent And for default in any of these he may be suspended from preaching or if any gross immorality is proved against him he can be immediately deposed and rendered incapable of officiating as a Minister of the gospel Appeal indeed lies as I said before from the decision of the inferior to the supreme court  Great care is taken in preparing young men for the ministry After going through a course of philosophy in one of our four Universities they must attend at least for four years the DivinityHall where they hear the prelections of the professors and perform the different exercises prescribed them they must attend the Greek the  Hebrew and Rhetoric classes and before ever they are admitted to tryals for the ministry before a Presbytery they must lay testimonials from the different professors of their mortis their attendance their progress before them and if upon tryal they are found unqualified they are either set aside as unfit for the office or enjoined to apply to their studies a year or two more  Our livings are in general from to l sterling Some few livings are richer and a few poorer Every minister besides is entitled to a mansionhouse barn and stable to four acres of arable and three of pasturage land Our livings are exempted from all public duties as are also our persons from all public statuteworks As schools are erected in all our parishes and  that education is cheap our young generation is beginning to imbibe some degree of taste and liberal sentiment unknown to their illiterate rude forefathers The English language is cultivated even here amongst  these  bleak and dreary mountains  Your  Divines  your  Philosophers  your  Historians  your  Poets have found their way to our sequestred vales and are perused with pleasure even by our lowly swains and the names of  Tittotson  of  Atterbury  of  Clerk  of  Secker  of  Newton  of  Locke  of  Bacon  of  Lyttelton  of  Dryden  of  Pope  of  Gay  and of  Gray  are not unknown in our distant land  NUMBER II Account of the fading Woman of  Rosshire  Dunrobin  Aug    The Information of Mr  Rainy  MissionaryMinister in  Kincardine  anent  Katharine M'Leod  KAtharine M'Leod  daughter to  Donald M'Leod  farmer in  Croig  in the parish of  Kincardine Rosshire  an unmarried woman aged about thirtyfive years sixteen years ago contracted a fever after which she became blind Her father carried her to several physicians and surgeons to cure her blindness Their prescriptions proved of no effect He carried her also to a lady skilled in physic in the neighborhood  who doubtfull whether her blindness was occasioned by the weakness of her eyelids or a defect in her eyes found by the use of some medicines that the blindness was occasioned by a weakness in her eyelids which being strengthened she recovered her fight in some measure and discharged as usual every kind of work about her father's farm but tyed a garter tight round her forehead to keep up her eyelids In this condition she continued for four or five years enjoying a good state of health and working as usual She contracted another lingering fever of which she never recovered perfectly  Some time after her fever her jaws fell her eyelids closed and she lost her appetite Her parents declare that for the space of a year and threequarters they could not say that any meat or liquid went down her throat  throat Being interrogated on this point they own'd they very frequently put something into her mouth But they concluded that nothing went down her throat because she had no evacuation and when they forced open her jaws at one time and kept them open for some time by putting in a stick between her teeth and pulled forward her tongue and forced something down her throat me coughed and strained as if in danger to be choaked One thing during the time she eat and drank nothing is remarkable that her jaws were unlocked and she recovered her speech and retained it for several days without any apparent cause for the same she was quite sensible repeated several questions of the shorter catechisms told them that it was to no purpose to put any thing into her mouth for that nothing went down  her throat as also that sometimes she understood them when they spoke to her By degrees her jaws thereafter fell and she lost her speech  Some time before I few her she received some sustenance whey watergruel c but threw it up at least for the most part immediately When they put the stick between her teeth mentioned above two or three of her teeth were broken It was at this breach they put in any thing into her mouth I caused them to bring her out of bed and give her something to drink They gave her whey Her neck was contraded her chin fixed on her breast nor could by any force be pulled back she put her chin and mouth into the dish with the whey and I perceived she sucked it at the abovementioned breach as a child would suck the breast and immediately  threw it up again as her parents told me she used to do and she endeavoured with her hand to dry her mouth and chin Her forehead was contracted and wrinkled her cheeks full red and blooming Her parents told me that she slept a great deal and soundly perspired sometimes and now and then emitted pretty large quantities of blood at her mouth  For about two years past they have been wont to carry her to the door once every day and she would shew signs of uneasiness when they neglected it at the usual time Last sumsummer after giving her to drink of the water of the weil of  Strathconnen  she crawled to the door on her hands and feet without any help She is at present in a very languid way and still throws up what she drinks  NUMBER III Parallel Roads in  GlenRoy  ALL the description that can be given of the Parallel Roads or Terrasses is that the Glen of itself is extremely narrow and the hills on each side very high and generally not rocky In the face of these hills both sides of the glen there are three roads at small distances from each other and directly opposite on each side These roads have been measured in the compleatest parts of them and found to be paces of a man five feet ten inches high The two highest are pretty near each other about yards and the lowest double that distance from the nearest to it They are carried along the sides of the glen with the utmost regularity  nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compass  Where deep burns or gullies of water cross these roads they avoid both the descent and ascent in a very curious manner so that on the side where the road enters those hollows they rather ascend along the slope and descend the opposite side until they come to the level without the traveller being sensible of ascent or descent There are other smaller glens falling into this  GlenRoy  The parallel roads surround all these smaller ones but where  GlenRoy  ends in the open country there are not the smallest vestiges of them to be seen The length of these roads in  GlenRoy  are about seven miles There are other two glens in that neighbourhood where these roads are equally visible called  GlenGluy  and  GlenSpean  the former running northwest and the latter south from  GlenRoy  Both these roads are much about the same length as  GlenRoy  It is to be observed that these roads are not causeway but levelled out of the earth There are some small rocks though few in the course of these roads People have examined in what manner they made this passage through the rocks and find no vestige of roads in the rock but they begin on each side and keep the regular line as formerly So far I am indebted to Mr  Trapaud  Governor of  Fort Augustus  I cannot learn to what nation the inhabitants of the country attribute these roads I was informed that they were inaccessible at the east end open at the west or that nearest to the sea  and that there were no traces of buildings or  druidical  remains in any part that could lead us to suspect that they were designed for oeconomical or religious purposes The country people think they were designed for the chace and that these terrasses were made after the spots were cleared in lines from wood in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed in order that they might come within reach of the bowmen who might conceal themselves in the woods above and below Ridings for the sportsmen are still common in all great forests in  France  and other countries on the continent either that they might pursue the game without interruption of trees or shoot at it in its passage  Mr  Gordon  p of his Itinerary mentions such terrasses to the  number of seventeen or eighteen raised one above the other in the most regular manner for the space of a mile on the side of a hill in the county of  Tweedale  near a village called  Romana  and also near two small  Roman  camps They are from fifteen to twenty feet broad and appear at four or five miles distance not unlike a great amphitheatre The same gentleman also has observed similar terrasses near other camps of the same nation from whence he suspects them to be works of the  Romans  and to have been thrown up by their armies for itinerary encampments Such may have been their use in those places but what could have been the object of the contrivers of the terrasses of  GlenRoy  where it is more than probable those conquerors never came remains a mystery except the conjecture above given should prove satisfactory  NUMBER IV  GALIC  PROVERBS    LEAGHAIDH a Chòir am bèul an Anmbuinn  Justice itself melts away in the mouth of the feeble    'S làidir a thèid 's anmbunn a thig

ChurchYard  SINCE the printing of p I have been favored with two beautifull drawings of the pillars  The lesser pillar engraven with these is by tradition of the country thought to belong to these but Mr  Farish  thinks it is at too great a distance from them to admit of that supposition its height is six feet  in  Penrith  ChurchYard One was communicated to me by the Rev Mr  Farish  of  Carlisle  and represents them in their present state the other by the Rev Mr  Monkhouse  Fellow of  Queen's College Oxford  which is a view of them before they were mutilated The first is certainly a most authentic representation of them the last varies in many particulars from the form they now appear in in that  the columns are drawn entirely square from top to bottom whereas the lower part of the pillars now extant are rounded There is no fretwork on the old drawing of these columns but instead are two small rude figures of human heads The thin semicircular stones are deeply and regularly indented on their edges which appear of an equal thickness throughout whereas the others are very sharp or ridged at one extremity and dilate gradually till they arrive at a considerable thickness at the other The figures in the old sketch are of a boar and perhaps a bear The upper ends of these pillars seem faithfully to supply what has been destroyed a cross and a capital  How this great variation in the drawings of the same columns happened is not easy to say for it does  not appear that there ever were any others in the place Time has obliterated the figures of the animals but whether any workman had chizzled the whole shafts of the pillars to their present form is I think scarcely to be conjectured they bear all the appearance of antiquity The old drawings are done with much elegance and are copied from some collections in the custody of Mr  Monkhouse  formed by  Hugh Todd  D D Prebendary of  Carlisle  and Vicar of  Penrith  as materials for the antiquities of the diocese he belonged to Notwithstanding my doubts about the entire fidelity of the old drawing which was done about the year I cause it to be engraven as a companion to the other in hopes that some antiquarian of the country will oblige the Publick by clearing up the point  By Mr  Monkhouse  's permission I annex Doctor  Todd  's account of these antiquities  At the north door of the church are erected two large stone pillars of a pyramidical form cruciated towards the top each of them fifteen feet high and plac'd at the distance of seventeen feet from each other The space between them is surrounded with the rude figures of four boars or wild hogs What this monument denotes and for what reason it was first erected may be somewhat uncertain The common vulgar report is That one  Ewen  or  Owen Coesarius  a very extraordinary person famous in these parts for hunting and fighting about years ago whom no hand but the hand of Death could  overcome lyes buried in this place His stature as the story lays was prodigious beyond that of the  Patagons  in  South America  viz fifteen feet That the two pillars denote his height and the four ough unpolish'd stones betwixt represent so many wild boars which had the honour to be kill'd by this wonderful giant That there might be in remote times in these regions men of large gi gantick figures as there are now near the  Magellanic  Streights and that they might affect  Roman  sirnames and distinctions as the  Americans  about  Darieen  do  Spanish  needs not either be discussed or denied But those persons give the best account of the original nature and design of these stones who look upon them as of a much later date and for a very different intention That they were  erected long after the introduction of christianity at the north or Death's door of the church in the form of a cross in order to rest the bodies of the dead upon them and to pray for their souls as the manner was And that the four figures of Boars are the cognizance  The Bear and raggedstaff was but I do not recollect that the Boars had any thing to do with the Earls of  Warwick  But as Boars and Bears are represented on the stones it seems as if this Mr  Caesarius  was a knighterrant who cleared the country of monsters so in memorial of his exploits these figures were engraven The heads too might have been cut on the columns in memory of some petty tyrants of the neighborhood whom he had demolished for such bloody trophies were in former days very common witness among the  Welsh  the  Tripen Sais  or three Englishmen's heads borne in the arms of many of our families as a token of the prowess of their ancesters  of the Earls of  Warwick  some of whom held the seigniory of  Penrith  and lived in the castle and might be at the expence of

The variety of the black game mentioned by M  Brisson  under the name of  Coq de Bruyere piquetè  was a mixed breed between these two birds but I could not hear that any at present were to be found in  North Britain Linnaeus  has met with them in  Sweden  and describes them under the title of  Tetrao cauda bifurca subtus alho punctata  Ptarmigan  Another of the grous kind common on the summits of the highest highland hills  Vide  p and  Br Zool illustr  p If I mistake not I have heard that a few are still found on the  Cumberland  mountains  Bustard  Now extinct in  Scotland Boethius  says

PineBulfinch  Br Zool illustr  p Found during summer in the pineforests of  Aberdeenshire  and probably breeds there  Snowflake  I have had lately an opportunity of comparing this bird with the greater Brambling and find them to be different and not as I once thought varieties of the fame kind The size of this is less and the claw of the hind toe much shorter A few of these birds breed with the  Ptarmigans  on the summits of the highest mountains but the greatest numbers migrate from the most distant north even from  Greenland  and  Spitzbergen  Vide  Br Zoel illustr  p  WATER FOWL

some other birds which were supposed to have migrated out of  GreatBritain  He also discovered in the Isle of  Tirey  the  Tringa interpres  REPTILES  Snake  A new  British  Snake was discovered in  Aberdeenshire  by the late Doctor  David Skene  a gentleman whose loss will be deplored by every lover of natural history for to great knowlege was added the most liberal and communicative disposition The account he favored me with of this reptile was this Its length was fifteen inches it had no  scuta abdom  or  caudalia  but was entirely covered with small scales which on the upper  part of the held were larger than the rest the tongue was broad and forked the nostrils small and round and placed near the tip of the nose the eyes lodged in oblong fissures above the angle of the mouth the belly was of a bluish leadcolor with small white spots irregularly dispersed the rest of the body of a greyish brown with three longitudinal blackish brown lines one extending from the back of the head to the point of the tail the two others were broader and extended the whole length of the sides Doctor  Skene  informed me that it was the same with the  Anguis Eryx  of  Linnaeus  p  FISH  Basking Shark  This species frequents the Firth of  Clyde  and the seas of the western isles the Trustees for the forfeited estates encourage the fishery and furnish the adventurers with money to purchase the proper materials  Picked Dog  Swarms on the eastern coast of  Scotland  and is taken and cured for the use of the common people Mr  James Robertson  observed near the  Isle of  Skie  a species called there the  Blindhive  which is reckoned a great restorative  Greater Weever  Draco major seu araneus  Salvian This species was taken near  Scarborough  and communicated to me by Mr  Travis  Its length eleven inches greatest depth one inch and threequarters head flat eyes large edges of the jaws rough with minute teeth the lower jaw the longest and slopes less than that of the common species the head covered with minute tubercles cheeks and gills covered with small scales on the last is a sharp spine  First dorsal fin is black and consists of five spines the second reaches within a small distance of the tail the pectoral has thirteen branched rays the ventral six the anal extends as far as the second dorsal tail large triangular and even at the end  The scales run in oblique lines from the back to the belly with a division between each row  Codfish  One was taken at  Scarborough  in which measured five feet eight inches and its girth round the shoulders five feet its weight b and was sold for a shilling  Saury  Saurus  Rondel After a violent storm from the N E in  November  last a great number of these fish were flung on shore in the Firth of  Forth  on the sands of  Leith  An account and an accurate figure of one of them was communicated to me by Mr  George Paton  of  Edinburgh  a gentleman who is a zealous promoter of natural knowlege  Its length is eleven inches the nose slender the jaws produced like those of the Sea Needle but of equal lengths and the upper mandible slightly recurvated their length one inch eyes large body slender and anguilliform but towards the tail grows suddenly smaller and tapers to a very inconsiderable girth on the lower part of the back is a small fin with six spurious between that and the tail like those of the Mackrel correspondent to these are the anal  I Greater Weever  II Saury  and six spurious the pectoral and ventral fins very small the tail much forked the back when fresh was of a dark color
