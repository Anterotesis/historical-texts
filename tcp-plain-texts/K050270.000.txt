 A Brief STATE of the INLAND OR Home Trade OF ENGLAND And of the OPPRESSIONS it suffers and the DANGERS which threaten it from the INVASION of HAWKERS PEDLARS and CLANDESTINE TRADERS of all Sorts  Humbly Represented to the Present PARLIAMENT  LONDON Printed for THO WARNER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaternosterRow    INTRODUCTION  _THE King in his Most Gracious Speech at the Opening the present Sessions of Parliament has been pleas'd to express himself with such an Inimitable Goodness and Royal Tenderness in Behalf of all his People and in Regard to the Good and Prosperity of their Trade in particular that we cannot take our Rise from a better and more promising Foundation in the Important Case now before us  In one Part His Majesty tells us  That in the Peace now concluded with  Spain  it was his First Care to consult the Interest of his own Subjects preferable to any other Consideration  In another  How careful he was that his own Subjects might reap the earliest Fruits of the Peace  That  saving the Expence of his Subjects is a sensible Pleasure to him  That  he looks with Compassion on the Hardships of the Artificers and Manufacturers  That  the Interest of his Subjects has been the Rule of all his Actions and Object of his Wishes  In short The Whole Speech is full of the most Affectionate and Tender Expressions such as truly and perfectly describe a Prince fill'd with Thoughts of Goodness and Beneficence TO and a true Father OF his People and whose whole Study and Delight it is and will always be to make them HAPPY and EASY  The Uses I bring all these Observations to and the Reasons of beginning our Work in this Manner are these  We may with infinite Satisfaction promise our selves that any reasonable dutiful Application TO and any Proposal truly Calculated for the Good of our Country and for the Advantage of its Commerce if laid BEFORE his Majesty in a proper Place and Manner will always meet with a Royal Smile and be bless'd with his Favour and Concurrence  We may with the like Satisfaction hope That this open Declaration of his Majesty's Desire to propagate the Interest of his People and to encourage their Trade will inspire the Honourable House of Commons with the same Sentiments and move them to exert themselves on all Occasions for delivering the Trading Part of his Majesty's Subjects from the Grievances and Oppressions they labour under  In this View these Sheets are presented to the Publick being the humble Complaint of the chief Trading Part of the whole Kingdom against a Sort of People who however unhappily allow'd by the Publick for the present are in the Nature of their Business and especially by the Manner of their carrying it on become an heavy Oppression Ruinous and Destructive to the Prosperity of Trade in general and Injurious to every fair Trader in particular  All which they find themselves encourag'd as above to lay before his Majesty in Parliament where alone it can be redress'd  A BRIEF STATE OF THE Inland or Home Trade  c  CHAP I Of the Excellent Order and Method of carrying on our Home Trade in  England  from the first Principles or Materials of our Manufactures to the finishing of them  _PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION are the Beginning and End of all Trade  The Materials produc'd whether they are the Production of Nature or Art are the SUBJECT of Trade  The passing of those Productions thro' the several working Hands necessary for their  Improvement or to their several Markets for Sale is not improperly called the CIRCULATION of Trade  The admirable Order of this Circulation of Trade is a most agreeable Speculation  It is an Inquiry not unworthy the most Exalted Genius not below the most Superior Dignity  The Causes of it are found in the Nature of the Thing and the Consequences of it in the Wealth and Prosperity of the Whole Kingdom  How the meanest Trifles accumulate a Value as they pass from Hand to Hand How they become Important Rich Useful and Beautiful by the Addition of Time Labour and the Improvement of Art and how the meanest Labourer or Mechanick contributes by unwearied Application to finish in a mere Road of instructed Workmanship those Beauties in Nature which even he himself does not at all understand  As in a Piece of the finest ClockWork we find each Man working on his distinct Part to the greatest Perfection yet the Beauties are not seen till the whole Frame is form'd by another Agent which Agent also can no more perform the separate Parts than the separate Workmen can the Whole  But the Beauty of this Oeconomy in Trade is not all for Speculation is not our Business here But this Circulation is the essential vital  Part of the Prosperity of our Commerce and especially of our Home Trade in this Nation and as such it becomes the just Concern of every Lover of his Country  Every Head and Hand ought to be employ'd to Preserve Support Enlarge and Encrease it as the main Thing on which the Health of Trade depends and in the Decay Shortning or Contracting of which our Trade must necessarily Languish Droop and Die and this brings us down directly and without any Circumlocutions or Explanations to the Case before us  This Beautiful Scheme of Trade as descrihed in all its Circulating Meanders of which we shall speak in their Place has of a long Time suffered a Decay it has felt strange Shocks and Convulsions and met with great Obstructions among us and that of many Kinds and from many several Causes  Particularly it has been attack'd by open Enemies who have even endanger'd the Whole Oeconomy and do still threaten something fatal to us if timely Help and Assistance be not obtained and the Evils removed by some powerful Succour of Laws and Government and this is  in short  the Sum and Substance of the Case before us  The Circulation of Trade to go back to what has been laid down above takes in all the several Progressions which our Produce or Manufactures make in their ordinary  Course from the first Principles of Trade to the Retailer who hands them on to the Consumer  Almost every thing that is Sold whether it be the Product of Nature or Art passes thro' a great Variety of Hands and some Variety of Operations also before it becomes what we call fit for Sale  Even our very Provisions which may be said to make the least Stop and pass thro' the fewest Hands yet are trac'd thro' several before they come to the Consumer For Example  Our  FleshMeat  the Cattle are first Bred then Fed then Driven to one Fair or Market then to another then Sold to the Butcher and then to the Eater In every one of those Circulating Removes the Breeder Feeder Drover Butcher with their Cattle Horses Servants and Families are severally maintain'd by and get a small Share of Profits from the Creature Sold and which is at last charg'd upon and return'd from the Price of the Meat when kill'd and Bought by the Consumer  The  Corn  as suppose the Wheat here is first the Farmer who raises the Crop not to mention the LandedMan the Plough the Seed the Harvesting and the carrying it to Market is the Business of the Farmer but under him it passes all the Operations of the Horses the Servants the Carriages  and several other things included in that Part call'd Husbandry and for the Support of which several other Tradesmen are concern'd such as the Smith the Wheelwright the Collar and Harnessmaker the Tanner and many others all whose Families find their Subsistance out of the mere Husbandry so it is very properly called of the Corn But when all that is over it passes another whole Class of Operators before it comes to the end of its Circulating Race It is carry'd to the Mill to be Ground under that Head comes in the Millwright several Tradesmen furnishing the Timber the Ironwork and Brasswork for the Mill the Millstones out of  Derbyshire  or from  France  The Carriage of those heavy Articles and all the Etcetera's depending thereon  Then the Dressing the Grinding for Fine or Coarse then it passes one Sale at least to the Baker then 'tis bak'd into Bread its last Operation and passes many depending Hands upon that Account  The Second Branch of Corn is the  Barley  this is first Sold to the Malster then Malted then Sold again perhaps more than once then Brew'd pays Excise and is doubly Gauged in the Malt and in the Liquor then sold to the Victualler and Innholder and then to the Consumer in all which Motions necessary to their Sale the several Tradesmen thro' whose Hands they pass with their Servants  Horses and Families and many others depending upon them especially in the Brewing and Malting gain a Maintenance out of the increasing Value and live by the Profits of their Trade and the like of other Sorts of Provisions some of which come from the Growth to the Mouth with a shorter some with a larger Circulation  But setting these Kinds aside which  as we say  come thus under a shorter Operation because the Species differ exceedingly when we come to speak of the Productions of Art that is to say the Manufactures Here we find an innumerable Multitude of Families concerned in and maintained by them the several Kinds of their Manual Operation are numberless and the Operators are much more so the Produce of Nature is indeed the  Materia Fabricata  of all Manufactures but the Improvements of Art give a new Face to the very Species so that you know it no more either by its Form or by its Name  The Transmutation is performed by an infinite Number of People the Wooll which bears every where the same Denomination at first retains its Name but a very little while and its Form less after its first passing the  Co  or the  Comb  it comes to the Spinner and is then no more call'd Wooll but Yarn from thence to the Weaver and there it assumes as many Shapes as Names and is called Cloth Stuff Serge Drugget Bay  Say and a numberless Catalogue of Denominations as the Fancy of the several Clothiers and Manufacturers please to Coin for it  While it is in the Hands of the Weaver and continues rough and undrest it retains the Shape of the Yarn both in the Woof and the Warp which are visible in the Stuff let the Kind be what it will But when it has past the Fuller's Art and been hurried into a violent Motion in the  ThickingMill  it comes out with another Face and being then dress'd under the Sheets and the Press we see no more the Thread but a fine and beautiful Face set forth to all possible Advantage by the Cloathworkers Art  It is not possible to give the Detail in the narrow Compass of this Work of all the several Sorts of Workmen their Engines Mills Looms and other Tackle with the several Operations through which our Woollen Manufactures pass before they come to Market or before  as the Tradesmen call it  they are fit for Sale All which Workmen as well as the Makers of all the Engines Looms Mills  c  with their Families and Dependants are maintain'd fed cloath'd nay enrich'd by the said Manufactures and out of the advanc'd Value which they bear with them when they go to Market The Variety is such That some undertake to tell us there is not a BroadCloth that goes to  BlackwellHall  but that People have something to do by the Means of it and all get something out of it before it comes there  It is the same with the Silk Manufacture in its Degree with this Difference only that there are a numberless Multitude of People concerned in the Silk before it comes to us Several Trades are maintained by those particular Articles of Commerce which are necessarily run thro' before the Workmen can come at the first Principles of this Manufacture  I mean the Raw or ThrownSilk  it does not immediately come thither from the Worm that spins or makes it but passes many a Climate travels many a Desart employs many a Hand loads many a Camel and Freights many a Ship before it arrives here and where at last it comes in return for other Manufactures or in Exchange for our Money  Again even the Money as it is a Foreign Specie is it self also a Merchandize is a Return for other Trade and passes thro' many Thousands of Hands in the Mine in the Coin in the Navigation and all the other  Apparatus  of its Arrival in  England  before it reaches thus far and before it can purchase and pay for the Species which begins the Silk Manufacture  It is the like in all our  hard Ware  Manufactures whether in Iron Tin Copper Lead Gold Silver or what other Specie they may be some of the Metal is found in our own Mountains some in those of  Spain Africa Sweden Denmark India  and  America  To bring this all to the same Point With what admirable Skill and Dexterity do the proper Artists apply to the differing Shares or Tasks allotted to them by the Nature of their several Employments in forming all the beautiful Things which are produced from those differing Principles Thro' how many Hands does every Species pass What a Variety of Figures do they Form In how many Shapes do they appear From the Brass Cannon of to hundred Weight to half an Inch of Brass Wire called  a Pin  all equally useful in their Place and Proportions  On the other Hand how does even the least Pin contribute its nameless Proportion to the Maintenance Profit and Support of every Hand and every Family concerned in those Operations from the Copper Mine in  Africa  to the Retailer'sShop in the Country Village however remote And this brings us down to the Circulation of the Manufactures in that we call the buying and selling Part as well Wholesale as Retale which I refer to a Chapter by it self  CHAP II Of the Circulation of the Inland Trade after the finishing the several Manufactures in remote and different Places  THE Country is ordinarily the Seat of the Manufactures there they assume their first Being as a marketable Species  It is true the City has of late Years encroacht a little and we find a very great Stroke of the Manufacturing Trade carried on here especially in  Spittlefields  and Parts adjacent  But of that by it self  Let us now suppose every Manufacture form'd in its proper Place every Trade running in its right Channel  The fine  Spanish  Cloths and Druggets are made in  Wiltshire Somersetshire Barkshire  c  The Serges Duroys Perpets and LongElls in  Devonshire  and  Somersetshire  The Stuffs of many Sorts Camblets  c  at  Norwich  The Tammies and Callamancoes at  Coventry  The Stockings knit in Frames at  Leicester  and  Nottingham  The NarrowCloth Kersies and Shalloons in  Yorkshire  and so of all the other Kinds of Goods called Woollen Manufactures in their several particular Parts  Let us suppose these I say all finished and made ready for Sale in the several Places or Counties as above or any where else and resting in the Hands of the  MasterMaker  or Manufacturer ordinarily called a Clothier  That he may put them off and they may be sold to the proper Persons who are to use or wear them it is necessary to have them sent to Market This Market Occasions several very Extraordinary Removes which when particularly mentioned will naturally describe the Circulation spoken of above  Nature and the Course of Business has made  London  the Chief or Principal Market for all these things call'd Manufactures not those above specify'd only but all the rest And it is easy to show That there must be such a Chief or Principal Market And That it is also necessary that  London  should be the Place  It is necessary there should be such a Chief Market because as the Manufactures and Tradesmen in the Country have much to sell that is to say more than lesser and  meaner Towns can take off so they have by themselves and their Correspondents in the Country much to buy that is to say more than any less Capital Port and Market or a Place of less General Correspondence could supply nothing less than  London  could answer the Ends of a Wholesale Trade  This proves also that  London  must be the Place The Merchants of  London  carrying on a general Correspondence with all the World are able to vend the Quantity of Manufactures which the Clothiers send up be it never so great and this they do by the Bulk of their Exportation They are also able to supply the Carriers with BackCarriage from the Bulk of their Importations and thus they spread and circulate the Growth of Foreign Countries in return for our own  This no single Town City or SeaPort in  England  can do  London  and  Bristol  excepted nor can  Bristol  do it so universally as  London  for this Reason the Manufacturers every where in the Country will send their Goods to  London  because here their Carriers can have a BackCarriage without which they cannot travel Here they the Clothiers and the Shopkeepers their Neighbours can buy all the several Kinds of Foreign Importations from what Part of the World soever they come which can no where else be done at least not at first Hand  And which goes yet farther such is the Wealth and so great the Stocks of the  London  Dealers That here the Makers can have Money for their Manufactures and here they and the Shopkeepers also can have Credit and that to a Degree which no other Place can give they can always sell for Money and generally buy without take Credit and give none nor is it boasting in Behalf of the Citizens and Wholesale Men of  London  to say That the Shopkeepers in the Country generally speaking trade upon their Stocks  These are some of the Reasons which secure the gross of the Trade to  London  and will do so tho' the Grievances and Discouragements which we are now to complain of tend to lessen and impair it here the main Stream will run as to the Center as the Rivers to the Ocean and as the Blood to the Heart and it is certainly for the Health of the whole Body of Trade that it should be so and the Proof of that is as evident as the other  By this sending up the finished Manufactures in bulk to the City of  London  and the Country Shopkeepers buying their Goods from thence in Return the following Advantages follow to the general Body of the People of  England viz  All that innumerable Number of Carriages Horses and Servants with all the necessary Appendices of Land Carriage which such a Trade calls for are maintain'd It is not the Business of this Work to make Calculations of Numbers but it is our Business to give the Reader a clear View of the Benefit and Gain of the several Branches of our circulating Trade that he may have a like clear View of the injurious Consequence of those New Methods of Trade which would destroy it  As the Carriage is prodigious great as well by Land as Water for it is the first we are now speaking of so the Number of Inns and Publickhouses are incredible which are now to be seen not only in the Towns and Cities but every where on the Roads where those Carriers and Travellers pass All these are chiefly maintain'd by those Carriages and by the Men and Horses which travel continually for the carrying on the general Correspondence too and from  London  Their Number is really prodigious  The Increase of Trade among those Inns  c  and by their Means the Consumption of Fodder Hay Corn  c  with Provisions of all Sorts is unaccountably great and the Benefit of it to the landed Interest is a Speculation worth the Notice of all Gentlemen of Estates throughout  England  They feel most sensibly the Benefit of this Circulation they  are easily made sensible what the Benefit to Trade is that  London  is able to furnish a back Carriage by Shopkeepers Goods as they are called such as Grocery Oyl Wine Fruit and in a Word all Goods of Foreign Importation without this how would the  Sheffield  and  Birmingham  Carriers bring up their wrought Iron Things of a heavy Carriage How would the  Warwickshire  People bring up their Cheese The  Yorkshire  Men their coarse Cloths The Manufacturers of  Exeter Taunton Norwich Wilts Gloucester  and  Worcester  their fine Goods They must all come the dearer to Market  No more on the other Hand could the Citizens of  London  supply the Country Chapmen with Foreign Goods without a double Charge for Carriage which would make the Price so much the dearer to the Buyer so that this Circulation is an Alternative to Trade the Country is a Help to the City and the City is a Help to the Country as a  French  Proverb expresses it  One Hand washes t'other Hand and both Hands wash the Face  Unhappy Creatures must they be whose Station in Life by the Fate of their own ill Policy is placed in the midst of this Stream to intercept the Course of the Trade in its natural Channels and where it circulates so aptly for the Good of the Whole and who would cut short the Means of its doing good to the whole Community  The wretched  Pedlar  would at once blow up this happy Order of Things he cuts off the Carriage too and from the Center of Trade and pretends to carry things a nearer Way tho' quite out of their own Road And indeed 'tis but a Pretence for he does all the Mischief to Trade that its worst Enemy can do and fails in all the Pretences of Good as we shall make appear in its Place  CHAP III Of the Manner of carrying on the Retale Trade by the Assistance of the City of  London  in all the most distant Parts of this Kingdom  BY this admirable Oeconomy of Trade Business is extended into the remotest Parts of the Kingdom Shops are opened in every Parish nay in every Village and Hamlet These smaller Shops diffuse and spread not the Manufactures of the remotest Part of the Country only but the Product and imported Growth of Foreign Countries and Kingdoms into every Corner of the Island where they are all sold by Retale to  the particular Families and Inhabitants of their Neighbourhood  By this Means the Tea of  China  the Coffee of  Arabia  the Chocolate of  America  the Spices of the  Molucca's  the Sugars of the  Caribees  and the Fruit of the  Mediterranean  Islands are all to be found in the remotest Corners of  England Scotland Wales  and  Ireland  By this Method also all the several Manufactures of  England  tho' made in the most different and the remotest Counties are to be bought in every Place all being supplied from the great Center of the Nations Commerce the City of  London  The reason of mentioning this shall appear presently let us look a little first into the Consequences of it  Those little Retaling Shops are the Life of all our Trade by those the Bulk of the Business is carried on to the last Consumer and here all the Wholesale Trade as well of Home Manufactures as Foreign Importations is terminated and finished  The People that keep these Shops are suplied at the like Tradesmens Shops in the larger Towns or Cities according as Situation directs the Keepers of those Shops being supposed to have larger Stocks and so are able to give these lesser Dealers some Credit Again the Shopkeepers in those greater Towns are furnished by the Wholesale Men who are such as we call Country Dealers in  London  who likewise give Credit to those  Chapmen in the principal Towns in the Country  These Wholesale Men in  London  are indeed the support of the whole Trade they give Credit to the Country Tradesmen Chapmen and even to the Merchants themselves so that both Home Trade and Foreign Trade is in a great Measure carried on upon their Stocks  To these Men or to the Factors and Warehouse Men of whom these Dealers buy all the Manufactures of  England  in whatsoever Part of the Country they are made are sent up to  London  for Sale and from  London  circulated again as above into all the remotest Parts among the Shopkeepers and by them in Retale Trade to the Wearers and Consumers  It is on these Retalers that all the People of  England  depend for the Supply of common Necessaries whether for Food Cloths HousholdStuff Ornament or whatever else they think fit to lay their Money out in even the Clothier himself cannot Cloth himself or the Farmer feed himself or Family without them  The Farmer may have Corn sufficient and Cattle sufficient for the Supply of his Family But when he comes to kill them for Food he sends to the Shopkeeper for Salt or the Beef will spoil before he can use it he must send to the Shop for Fruit for Spice  for Sugar to supply his Wife in her Kitchen he must send to another Shop for Pewter and Brass for his KitchenUtensils to the Smith for Spits and Jack IronPots and the like of other things and all this tho' the Iron Tin Copper and the Salt are the Growth of his own Country for they do not grow at his own Door and the Mines are not in his Farm nor are the Manufacturers of HardWare the Smiths of  Sheffield  and  Birmingham  at his Door the Casters of Iron Tin or Lead do not live in his Town so he must send to the Shopkeepers for all those Things as he wants them The Shopkeeper for the same Reason must have them from  London  for if he would send to  Sheffield  or to  Birmingham  for them he could find no Carriers to bring them and if they did he had nothing to load them back with so that the Goods would cost him double Carriage Of this also we shall have Occasion to speak again  Come we next to the Clothiers they are most Importent Men in their Way speaking of them in general Terms we say they are able to cloth the whole World But it must be taken with a due Latitude for them and their Neighbours for there is not a Clothier in  England  that can Cloath himself nay he cannot make himself a Coat take him in what Country you will he can indeed make  the Outside and he can call for a Taylor who is every where at hand to make it up  But even the Taylor himself must send to the Shop for Silk and Thread to sew it together and for even Needles and a Thimble or he will make but poor Work he must send to another Shop for Sheers and Sissars to cut out with and the like  Then for the Clothier himself when he has made the Cloth he must buy Shalloon or perhaps some other Manufacture made Miles off for a Lining he must have Buttons out of  Cheshire  about  Macclesfield  Dimity to line the Wastcoat out of  Manchester  Linnen to line the Breeches out of  Ireland  and a Hundred little nameless things some out of one County some out of another before the Clothier can be clothed his Hat comes from one Place Stockings from another Gloves from a Third and so on all those he sends to the Shopkeeper for and the Shopkeeper to the  London  Wholesale Man and he to the several Counties where those several things are the proper Business of the Place and thus we see the City must of Necessity be the Center of the Trade for the  London  Dealer has every Sort of Goods brought up by the proper Carriers and he enables those Carriers to bring them up cheap because he or the Dealers in other Goods which the Shopkeepers in that Country call for can load them back and so get the Carrier a double Freight  We might enquire here into the probable Number of these Shopkeepers in the several Countries all over this Island thereby farther to illustrate this Argument and judge of the Importance of this Circulation of Trade  But the Thing is impracticable it is out of the reach of all Calculation it is enough to say they are in their Particulars innumerable and may only be talk'd off by Thousands and Hundreds of Thousands for taking them with their real Dependencies they include almost the whole Body of our People  This will serve to stop the Mouths of all those who having no other  Plea  to bring in Favour of the  Hawkers  and  private Traders  those Enemies to all fair Trade would move us to Pity and Compassion for them on Account of their great Numbers Whereas they do not reflect how infinitely more numerous the Families of the Shopkeepers Manufacturers and Wholesale Dealers are who they injure and may be said to starve and reduce and how numerous the Poor are who depend on those fair Traders for Employment and Subsistence and who all cry to them for their Bread Here Compassion ought to work these we should turn our Eyes to and not to the other who eat them up and devour them and who either for their Numbers of significance are not to be named with them  But we shall see the Importance of them very distinctly by looking into the Mischiefs which we already feel by the Breaches made in this  excellent Oeconomy and the Ruin which threatens us if it be not speedily prevented and this is the Subject of the next Chapter  CHAP IV That all this Home Trade is interrupted and distress'd by the Invasion of  Hawkers Pedlars  and other  Clandestine Traders  the Circulation stopt and the  Retaling Shopkeepers  who are the Life of the Whole Trade intercepted and supplanted  AVARICE mask'd with a Pretence of Frugality is the most fatal Snare of a Tradesman it leads him not into Mischiefs only which are Personal and which wound himself but it pushes him upon Measures ruinous to Trade in general and so he becomes an Enemy to his Country and envies the Prosperity of all about him  He sees Trade run on in a happy Round of Buying and Selling Importing and Exporting Carrying up and Carrying down and that all the Way as it passes tho' thro' a Multitude of Hands it leaves something of Gain every where behind it and yet lessens not the Value of what it carries on and looking on this Beautiful Order of the Trade  with an  evil Eye  he projects to cut off the Progress of Things from their Natural Course shorten the length of the Circulation which is indeed the Life of the Whole and thinking to put all the Gain of Five or Six Stages of the Trade into his own Pocket he contrives or at least pretends to carry the Goods a shorter Way to the last Consumer so bringing Things to an immediate Period making himself the Carrier Factor WholesaleDealer Chapman and Retailer all in one Hand putting the Gain of all those Trades into the single Purse of a Pedlar and this is the Man we are now to speak of  His Original as above is founded in Avarice and Envy and the Measures he pursues tells us that it is his Trade to be a Supplanter He acts like a Man that maliciously turns the Stream of a MillRiver to his own private Use perhaps trisling and mean valuing not the starving twenty Mills which lie on the same Stream and must get their Bread and the Subsistence of their Families by the fair Produce of their Labour  In this he acts like a Thief and Destroyer not only to the Trade in general an Invader and Pirate to the fair Trader in particular but at the same Time is a Cheat to the Buyers and Consumers of the Goods he sells and in the whole to himself for he defeats his own Expectations and generally dies a Beggar all which we doubt not to make appear to the meanest Understanding in the Process of these Sheets  At an unhappy Juncture of Time when FUNDS for raising Money to the Government were wretchedly wanting and at a Time when the Fair Traders stood in need of all possible Encouragement to enable them to pay the great Taxes which they then began to feel the Weight of at that very Time and we may say in  an Evil Hour  a Project to licence these Pernitious People was proposed and for a trifling Payment compar'd to the fatal Effects of it to Trade was closed with and the said Licences granted We call it a trifling Payment because it seems to be so not only by Comparison as above but by the small Sums it brings in to the Publick  Ever since that Time they have been like Moths in Trade and have eaten into the very Vitals of our Commerce in a fatal and most injurious Manner encroaching upon the  Fair Traders  almost in every Branch of Business where the Goods they sell are light and portable spreading themselves into all Parts of the Country as well as City insinuating into the Opinion of the Ignorant by notorious Falshoods and Suggestions particularly that they have their Goods from the Makers buy them at the best hand have the best of every thing in its Kind and to sum up all that they sell every thing at a cheaper Rate than they the Buyer can be supply'd at by the Shops all which in every Particular we take upon us to prove are downright Falshoods  calculated on Purpose to deceive and and impose upon the ignorant Buyer And in a Word That their whole Trade is a stated and premeditated Fraud that it is so in the very Nature and Method of it as well as in the Design  If then in the Process of this Work we show as we doubt not to do that they neither buy at the best Hand are furnished with the best Goods nor are able to sell the best cheap we hope there will be no Difficulty to convince the Honourable Persons to whom we address these Sheets that they are a People pernitious in themselves and that they ought to be supprest  It may look like making room for an Objection here to say that these Men do not buy and cannot sell cheaper than the fair trading Shopkeepers for then it may be said what hurt can they do to Trade  The Answer is very plain and direct  viz  That they pretend too and loudly affirm the contrary and so abuse the ignorant Buyers they intercept the Trade they turn the Stream from the Mill  as was observed above  they invert the due Order and Course of Business for instead of the Customers going to the Shop they carry the Shop to the Customers instead of the Country Inhabitants frequenting the Markets which are the proper Places of Trade they make the Markets walk about to the Inhabitants  calling upon them at their Doors where if the People get nothing else they are gratified by saving them the Trouble of going out of Doors to the Shops or to the Market Towns which in some Cases is to them a thing of Consequence as Distance and Situation of Places may be and if it were no more than this the Shopkeeper is supplanted and cut out of the Trade and all the Chapmen and Dealers between him and the  London  Wholesale Men are likewise cut out of their Business in their Proportion  We might enlarge here upon the fatal Consequences of thus cutting off the Country Shopkeepers from their Business intercepting Trade and obstructing its regular Course the Necessity of which for the publick Prosperity we have so largely insisted upon above how by that Means so many Thousands of Families are supplanted in their Trades open their Shops in vain and are left destitute But we leave that to its proper Place  It is needful first to take these People in their own Way and lay open a little the Fraud which they use in their ordinary Course of Business How the People in the Countries ay and in the City too are impos'd upon by them and when we have detected them in their known Cheats we shall have the clearer View of the fatal Consequences of those Cheats in Trade  FAIR DEALING is the Honour of Trade and the Credit of the Tradesman a Shopkeeper may perhaps run out sometimes in Words for the setting out his Goods and the Buyer in running him down and not believing Truth in the most solemn Manner exprest is really the principal Cause of all those Excursions of Words which the Shopkeeper is as it were under a Necessity of making But these People can speak no other Dialect Truth is out of their way their Business will not bear it their Trade is a Fraud in it self and must be supported by Falshood and if they should at any Time deviate into Sincerity they would be kick'd out of Doors they can Trade no longer than they can Lmdashe for the very Beginning and End of their Business is to deceive Let us look a little into the Particulars  That they buy their Goods at the best Hand This even in it self is false and known to be so for we see them every Day in the Shops and Warehouses of the Wholesale Dealers in all Places where the Country Chapmen deal and where they buy indeed what the others leave which leads of Course to the next Pretence  viz  That they buy the best Goods which is as false as the other for it is well known that they buy the worst and meanest Goods of the several Kinds they deal in and particularly that which the Country Chapmen  refuse nor indeed will the Wholesale Dealers where they are Men of Honesty and have the Sense of their own Interest as well as of Justice in Trade sell to such People as those the best of their Goods which are lay'd in to supply their constant Chapmen who buy large Quantities and Merit to be used well nor does the Pedlars bringing his ready Money weigh in this Case for the Country Chapman who as above deals largely and constantly and pays well Merits to be used as well and indeed better than a Hawking Clandestine Trader who brings his Money because he has no Credit and pays down because he cannot buy without it who runs about from Warehouse to Warehouse to pick out any thing for the sake of Cheapness and is fixt no where The Warehouse Men will never show these their best Goods They know also They are not for their Turn And They will not give a Price for them and in this Manner the Pedlars stock themselves with Goods  Let us View them next upon their Circuits in the Country for selling them off It is true they travel as we call it cheap that they feed their Horse upon the  Waste  and themselves upon the  Spoil  that they lodge at the meanest Houses and in the meanest Places where they live like themselves that is wretchedly and at little or no Expence and this indeed is one just Article against their being suffered  in Trade for at the same time that they supplant the establish'd settled Shopkeepers who as above are the Supports of the whole Body maintain both Church and State the Civil and Religious Government feed the Poor and cloth the Rich These People do nothing in Civil Government pay for nothing bear no Offices raise no Taxes and which is still more pay no Rent for they have no Houses nor legal Settlement They pay neither Scot or Lot Church or Poor but in short are compleat Vagrants and ought their late unhappy Advantage excepted to be treated as such  Yet notwithstanding take them with all these Advantages it is not true in Fact that they can carry their Goods cheaper in Bulk than the Shopkeeper can have them carried and the Reason is very plain because the Carriers by having constant Business backward shall deliver Goods one kind with another at a cheaper Rate than even the Pedlar himself can carry them and if we allow for Carriage by Water whether by Sea or River Navigation much cheaper  The same Argument is against him in his Selling for less Profit than the Shopkeeper which is also a Mistake because the Shopkeeper out does him in Quantity which makes up the Profit in the whole to him tho' in the Particulars he may not gain so much It is a Maxim in Trade that light  Gain makes a heavy Purse and the Meaning is that a small Profit on a large Return makes the Tradesman Rich now 'tis a Mistake to say the Pedlar or private Trader can live on less Profit than the Shopkeeper because where the one Returns one Hundred Pound the other Returns a Thousand perhaps much more and can by Consequence lay up more by an Advance of two or three  per Cent  on his Goods than the other can by an Advance of ten  per Cent  This makes the mischievous Consequence of the Pedlar more and more evident for if by intercepting the Shopkeeper's Trade as above he prevents the said Shopkeeper making so large a Return he by the same Rule prevents his selling his Goods at all to Profit and so the poor Retailer is ruined of Course  But to return it is plain from hence that the private Trader cannot sell cheaper than the fair Shopkeeper no nor so cheap his return being small and the others large It is the same thing between the Retale Chapman and the Wholesale Dealer of whom he buys The latter selling in Bulk and by large Parcels can afford to sell at a low Rate that is to say for a small Profit suppose by Commission from the Maker or otherwise in which Case he is content with and a half or perhaps  per Cent  Provision for Sales whereas the Shopkeeper retailing the same Goods by small Quantities requires  a large Gain yet even his small Quantity may be called large compared to the smaller Returns of the Hawker and for that Reason the Hawker or Clandestine Trader cannot under sell the Shopkeeper besides the Advantage on the Shopkeepers side of selling the best Goods as above  If then he neither buys the best Goods nor sells best cheap as is plain above what can be said for a set of Men who supplant the fair Seller and do the Buyer no good They must be taken as they really are for Pyrates in Trade Thieves to their Country for tho' they may not be said to rob and break open Houses tho' they stand pretty fair for a Charge of that Kind too sometimes yet they rob their Country in a most egregious Manner supplanting the Tradesmen and confounding the Course of Trade by which the whole Country is maintained and in this they are Enemies to the publick Prosperity they starve the Poor impoverish the dilligent industrious Tradesmen and by Consequence the Manufacturers also who depend upon the Trade as it is carried on in its due Course and would be brought to starve and sink in the sinking of the Shopkeepers and that in a most deplorable Manner  CHAP V That these Hawkers and Clandestine Traders are the great support of the Smugglers and are the Tools of those Enemies to all the fair Trade by whom so fatal a Correspondence is carried on  CLandestine Traders are the Agents and Support of Cladestine Trade were there no receivers there would be no Thieves The first Part of the Hawkers Business is a Pyracy upon the Home Trade So in this last and basest Part they are Pyrates upon the Laws of Trade in General and of their Country in Particular as in the first they merit to be supprest and prevented so in the second they merit to be punished in the first they deserve Resentment but in the second they deserve the Gallows For indeed the carrying on a Smuggling Trade and especially as those Men do it avowedly is not a Breach of the Law only but a Contempt and Defiance of that very common Justice which is the only Reason of Law And doubtless it is as real a Felony in the Essence of the Crime as robbing a House is in the Letter of it and therefore running Goods  used to be called and that with great Propriety  Stealing  the Customs  But we have not room here to enlarge upon the Nature of the  Sin of Smuggling  or of the fatal Consequences of it to Trade which would take up a Volume by it self our present Work is to prove these People guilty of it only we crave leave to lay it before our Superiors as what is well worth their Consideration  viz  That they will never be able entirely to suppress the Smugglers till they can first suppress these Clandestine Traders  As the Retailer is the Life of all Trade so the Pedlar is the Essence of all Clandestine Trade as the Receiver is the Support of all Thieving so the Hawker is the Life of all Smuggling he hands on the Goods to the Consumer as he comes at them in the Dark so he disperses them in the Dark into innumerable Hands and into small Parcels where it is not possible to the Officers to discover or detect them for when uncustomed Goods are divided into innumerable Parts like the Blood in the capillary Vessels it is impossible to come at them in the Form of a legal Prosecution  It may be said that this is not a direct Charge upon the Hawker  c  and that the Fact of Smuggling cannot be proved upon them But we say it is a direct Charge for all that For we do not say they are really the Smugglers or Runners of the Goods themselves  but that they are Venders and Sellers of uncustom'd run Goods and in that Capacity they are the Supporters and Encouragers of that wicked Trade This they are not asham'd to acknowledge and even to use it as an Argument why their Customers should believe them that the Goods they sell are cheap namely  That they get them immediately from on Board a Ship  or that they had them from  such and such Seamen or Officers  who get them on Shore  so  and  so  that is to say they are run and have paid no Duty  Now tho' even in this they may be sometimes and are often times like a certain famous Gentleman who was known to boast of more Sins than ever he could commit and that they pretend the Goods are Run  when they are not  that so the Buyers as above may believe them cheap  when they are not  yet it must be said that if in any thing they are able to undersell and offer their Goods cheaper than the fair Traders it must be in this where they are Goods smuggled and clandestinely got on Shore without paying the Custom which is too often the Case  Thieves they say sell good Pennyworths they must do so else no Body would buy what they buy in the Dark they must sell in the Dark and we will not dispute this Part with them since they boast of the Crime  they ought to blush for let them take their Lot with the  Devonshire  Man that called himself the Miller when he was not See  the History of  Edward VI  This we are sure of that there is not one Article in this Part but what argues strongly against them and adds to the reasonableness of the Tradesmens Petition indeed there needs nothing more to be said to this Part as they are the Promoters of that vile smuggling Trade which in spight of Laws and in spight of all the Application of the Government to put those Laws in Execution yet continues to be carried on among us in a most unaccountable Manner they ought to be fenc'd against as Enemies to their Country Destroyers of its Commerce and in a Word of all fair and honest Dealing  It may be another little Exception in the Way also that this Charge does not reach to all the Hawkers and Pedlars and all the clandestine Traders in the Kingdom that is to say not this particular Part of the Charge  This does not make the Complaint of the Tradesman less just nor do we alledge any such thing but we may without a Slander say since a great Number offend in this Part and all are destructive in some Parts and we may say we believe it is rather want of Opportunity than Will if they are not concerned in this also as some Ladies are said to be Virtuous because they have not been tempted  Many of the Hawkers have their Circuits out of the way in the Inland Counties remote from the Sea Coast where this black Business of smuggling is only to be carried on and they do not because they cannot meddle with it But setting them a Side as it would be hard to charge them with the Crime who cannot commit it so I would be as loth to affirm that any of them have declined it whose Station has been in the way of it and we have good Reason to say from their common Dialect in their Trade that they value themselves upon it whether they may believ'd against themselves or no is a Question by it self  But it is sufficient to the Purpose in Hand if they are generally guilty in the Places where it is practicable We do not Charge any body with running Goods on Shore where there is no Shore or stealing Custom where no Custom is paid The Inland Counties that have no Sea Ports cannot be concerned in that Part of the Crime But even those Inland Counties may be and are the Markets where the smuggled Goods are sold and where the Agents of those Thieves of Trade dispose of them and this Part is performed by the People we speak of Here they harangue their Customers with the long Journies which they make the Pains they are at and the Hazards they run to get those Goods at the Sea Side and out of the Ships that bring them over tho' in  Fact they never came there but have that Part done to their Hands By these fine Stories they delude the ignorant People and persuade them to believe the Goods Foreign when they are not and cheap when they are dear  We might observe from this particular Part of their Management how fond they are to be thought worse Knaves than they are and to make the Buyers believe those Goods are run which really are not at the same time being very rarely without others that are nor would it be an unprofitable thing to argue upon in representing these People to the Parliament since it would be well worth the Consideration of that Honourable House Whether a set of People should be any longer continued in Trade whose greatest Advantage it is to have their Customers believe them to be Knaves and Thieves and who are chiefly traded with upon that Foot a Set of Men who if they were really just and honest could not live by their Business and if their Customers did not think them Rogues that is Smugglers would have no Business at all Some People since the Application that has been made for the suppressing these Pedlars have been apt to ask a gross Question  viz  what harm do they do to Trade or where is the Hurt of permitting them  Such a Question can hardly be ask'd for want of Ignorance that's certain but since 'tis necessary the ignorant Inquirer should be informed also we think this very Chapter will go a great way to do it namely that they are the great Receivers and Dispersers of prohibited Goods the Propagators of contraband Trade and the Encouragers of those profest Enemies of fair Trading the Smugglers and in a Word in doing that they break the Laws and invade the Property of Fair Dealing and clean Tradesmen who they injure in the highest Degree  Nor would it be unworthy the Consideration of the Honourable House of Commons whether it will be practicable however severe the Laws against Smuggling may be to put a Stop to that wicked Trade while those People are permitted who thus support and encourage it  One clandestine Trade always upholds another the Smugglers to give them their due run Risk enough as the Laws now lye against them and the Difficulties they are under to dispose of their prohibited Goods are very great and if they had not these private Traders to take them off and no doubt but they sell Pennyworths to engage them to do so and to dispose them by Retale they would never be able to go on but if these private Venders of uncustom'd Goods  be but once taken off who are their last Resort they the Smugglers would be utterly at a Loss and not able to put off the Goods when they had them of which we shall say more in its Place  This is in it self a full Answer to the gross Question mentioned above of what harm they do to Trade and why they should not be permitted  The Mischief they do in other Cases as in supplanting the Shopkeepers cutting off their Trade and serving their Customers at their own Doors and so shortning the Circulation of Business in the several Counties where they travel lessening the Carriage and in many other Articles have been fully spoken off already  It should be observ'd here tho' we have but just room to name it That as the Smuggling Trade has of late surprisingly encreased and been carried up to a prodigious heighth which appears plainly by the severe Acts of Parliament lately made against them so the Numbers of these private and clandestine Traders of whom we shall say more in the next Chapter have also encreased which manifestly shews and for that End we mention it here the Correspondence that has been kept up between them and their plain Dependence upon one another  CHAP VI Of the various Species of Pedlars who are concerned in this clandestine unlawful and destructive Trade and how they are distinguish'd by their manner of Trading but all joyn in this Part  viz  The fatal Blow they give to the settled Trade of this Kingdom and to the fair Traders mentioned before  THE Complaint in General lies indeed against the licenc'd Hawker or Pedlar and in order to have those Licences taken away and it seems by that Part as if these were the only People against whom the Charge lies But we are to observe that there are of late a great Number of other People crept into the same Business who also may be called  Hawkers  and  Pedlars  as well as any of the rest and who merit as much to be supprest these have no Licences and yet taking the Hazard of the Penalty run up and down in all the great Towns and Cities in  Britain  but especially in  London  to private Houses with their Goods Here they get into  the Favour of the Ladies and especially of their Maids Servants pretending that having Goods immediately from on board a Ship or from particular Interests with other Persons that have them so they are able to sell cheaper than the Shops  These are a set of People who as we have observed before value themselves upon being guilty of more Sins than they can commit and pretend to have run and uncustomed Goods to sell when they have not as well as when they have  These have their Arts however to delude and impose upon the Buyers and particularly by selling some Goods to loss rather than not suit the Fancy of the Lady they are dealing with that so the Person may boast of the Pennyworth and recommend the private Trader in which case they forget not and seldom fail to make up their Loss with Advantage at the next Occasion  By thus insinuating themselves into the Opinion of the Buyers they have infinite Advantages to deceive and impose upon them nor need we argue here upon the Power of the Imagination which acts so much in their Favour or how easy it is to abuse the Judgment by possessing the Fancy it is too well known in many like Cases that where the Buyer is previously possess'd with a Belief that the Person  can  sell cheaper than others 'tis next to impossible to persuade them that  he  does not  and harder still to persuade them that they are cheated and abused  This Charge particularly relates to such private Traders as go from House to House but would not be called Hawkers or Pedlars nor do they take any Licences so that they defraud the Publick both ways These apparently carry no Goods for what they have to sell being in small Bulk they easily conceal it or if not they have Servants to carry for them at some Distance so as to be called on any Occasion  That they are really Hawkers in the Sense of the Act is out of Question and they ought by the Act to take Licences that they really do sell uncustom'd and prohibited Goods is equally certain and that they frequently abuse those they sell to by pretending their Goods are such is as certain and they have been frequently detected and made to confess the Fraud  For Example  These People frequently sell Silk Handkerchiefs and call them  India  Muslins and call them  run  from on board the  India  Ships when in truth the first are bought in  Spittlefields  and the latter at the ordinary Drapers Shops and upon their being challeng'd they have made no scruple to confess it as is said above  On the other Hand they likewise sell  India  Silks Chints painted Callicoes and other Things such as are not only prohibited being  sold but even the Use and Wearing also  By the first part of this Business they are Cheats in Trade abuse and impose upon the Buyer by Falshoods and foul Practices of several Sorts and on that Account ought to be supprest as Enemies of the Home Trade in General and by the latter Part they are Smugglers and Parties to the Smugglers dealing in felling and dispersing prohibited and uncustom'd Goods and are punishable by the several Laws they act against and in this last Case with Submission to our Superiors we humbly suggest that they merit to be supprest tho' the Injury which they do to the fair Traders and to the general Commerce of the whole Kingdom was not to be taken notice of The Reason I give for that is because it is the Wisdom of just Governments to endeavour to prevent the Subjects Offending rather than to desire to punish when Offences are committed  It is worth Consideration also whether some Laws more strictly forbidding this clandestine Commerce than any yet in being and more easily put in Execution are not absolutely necessary and if it be only with this View namely for the preventing the selling and dispersing prohibited and uncustom'd Goods seeing as is said above it is utterly impracticable to prevent the Smuggling Trade if the receiving selling and dispersing  the Goods when they are Run cannot be also prevented and this we believe to be utterly impossible but by putting a stop to the Hawkers Pedlars and private Traders as above  Besides these private and clandestine Traders there are another sort of Pedlars who carry on the Trade but evade the Force of the Act and these are such as Trade under the Protection of the several Provisoes in the Act reserv'd and stand it out if they are called upon insisting that they are not Hawkers or Pedlars within the Sense of the Law and that therefore they are not obliged to take out Licences  This and the backwardness of the Justices of Peace to put the Laws in Execution against them encourages such to carry on their Trade as it were in Defiance of the Act for Licensing Hawkers  c  These are such as travelling about the Country pretend to be the Makers and Manufacturers of the Goods they sell or the Agents or Servants of such Makers and Manufacturers and as such they pretend they are allow'd not only by the Act of Parliament for Licences but by several other Acts of Parliament formerly made against Hawkers and Pedlars to Trade and Travel as they do from Town to Town  Now as the Pretence is in it self a Fraud and the Practice is in it self as pernicious to Trade as any other of the Hawkers and Pedlars  Business except the last mentioned of Smuggling and encouraging the Smugglers Trade so it is needful to give a Brief Account of that Liberty which they pretend to how far it extends and how far not as also how it is abused by the Practises of those who pretend to it  It is true that in an Act  Annae Reginae  entitul'd an  Act for continuing Duties upon Low Wines and upon Coffee Tea Chocolate Spices  c  and upon Howkers Pedlars and Petty Chapmen  there is the following Proviso Pa of the said Act  'Provided nevertheless That whereas several Doubts have arisen touching Traders in the Woollen or Linnen Manufactures who Trade by Wholesale and set many Thousands of Poor to Work and yet for Want of the Convenience of WaterCarriage are obliged to send their Goods when Manufactured by Horses and otherwise to the Publick Markets Fairs and other Places Be it Enacted and Declared by the Authority aforesaid that all Persons Trading in the Woollen or Linnen Manufactures of this Kingdom and Selling the same by Wholesale shall not be deemed or taken to be Hawkers Pedlars and PettyChapmen within this or any other Act but that such Person or Persons and those that shall be immediately imployed under them to sell by Wholesale only may carry abroad Expose  and Sell the said Manufactures Any thing in this Act or any other Act or Acts to the contrary thereof notwithstanding  By this Proviso abundance of travelling People go about pretending to be the Makers and Manufacturers of the Goods they Sell or Agents and Servants of such but even in that Case they do not observe that the Law allows even such to sell by Wholesale only so that it is really nothing to the Purpose nor will it protect the People we speak of  There is likewise an Act made  Georgii  I passed in Favour of the Bonelace Makers in the following Terms  'And whereas several of the Makers and Traders in  English  Bonelace who Trade by Wholesale and employ many Thousands of Poor People in the said Manufacture of Bonelace have been lately informed against Prosecuted and Molested in the carrying on their Trades under pretence that they ought to take and have Licences according to the Directions and Provisoes of the Act before mentioned or of some other Acts touching Hawkers and Pedlars be it Enacted and Declared by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled and by the Authority of the same That no Person being a Maker or Wholesale Trader in  English  Bonelace  and Selling the same by Wholesale shall be adjudged deemed or taken to be a Hawker Pedlar or PettyChapman within the Intent and Meaning of the said Acts or of any or either of them and that all and every such Person or Persons his her or their Children Apprentices Servants or Agents Selling by Wholesale only shall and may go from House to House and from Shop to Shop to any of their Customers who Sell again by Wholesale or Retale without being subject or liable to any the Penalties or Forfeitures contained in any of the said Acts touching Hawkers Pedlars and PettyChapmen Any thing in the said Acts contained to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding  Under the Protection of this Clause abundance of unlawful Trade is carried on and other Goods besides Bonelace are sold in a private and a retale Manner all which are equally ruinous to Trade whereas it is to be observed that even the Liberty given to these Bonelace Men is even for their own Manufacture to sell by Wholesale only  Again in the Act of the th th  William  III for Licensing Hawkers  c  there is an Exemption of several Traders  'And on this Clause the Justices of the Peace's Clerks and Hawkers have form'd a formal Protection which was only at first in Writing occasionally but now in respect of  the Multiplicity of them and for giving it the greater Countenance they have Printed it on Parchment with the Queen's Arms on the Top as annexed by which Means the Commissioners conceive several Traders that ought to pay the Duty are permitted to go free  Sir  Edward Northey  Attorney General being consulted upon this Practice of the Justices Clerks gave it under his Hand that it was an illegal Practice his Opinion is as follows  'I conceive the Justices do ill to make such Certificates for that it is impossible for them to be certain that the Persons for whom they so Certify shall not Sell other Goods than what he or his Master makes and the making such Certificates may contribute to defraud the Crown of the Duty to be paid by Hawkers  c  However I think the Certificate ought not to be of any avail to the Person producing the same but he is to prove if insisted on before the Justice before whom he shall be brought that he is the Maker or Servant of the Maker of the Goods he Sells or ought to be convicted for Selling without a Licence contrary to the Act and I think it will be fit to advise the Justices not to make any more such Certificates for the future and to exhibit an Information against them if they shall make any such  Edward Northey  Another sort of Pedlars are such as travel from Town to Town  'There are a sort of People that travel from Town to Town and pretend to be WholesaleMen and take up some Rooms in some Inn or other of the said Towns where they generally Sell by whole Pieces and these People commonly send about Town to let them know that such Traders are come to Town and that they may be furnished with such Commodities as they Sell  There are many other Shifts and Turns made use of by the real Pedlars to evade the Act even for so small a Thing as the Licence only But we have not room here to give a List of them all it is enough to say that even in those Cases where any Liberties are allow'd by the Law they are always Transgressors of that Law and carry that Liberty farther than it was intended or farther than is allow'd by the true Intent and Meaning of the Law So industrious are these People to preserve a Liberty for carrying on a Business universally destructive to the Publick and so injurious to the fair Traders  Particularly it is to be observed here that even before the Acts for Licensing these People were past they were expresly forbidden as well by several Acts of Parliament as by the Privileges granted by Charter to several Cities  Towns and Corporations to open their Packs or expose their Goods to Sale in those Cities Towns or Corporations except on Publick Fairs and Market Days and in the open and publick Market Places respectively yet now under pretence of these Licences granted by Law they have taken upon them to traffick sell and carry about their Goods and open their Packs even in the City of  London  and the Suburbs thereof as if lawfully permitted to do so and especially the private Traders mentioned above do it continually without Regard to either the Laws called Acts of Parliament or the ByLaws of the said City and so in divers other Corporations also  So that it is evident the fair Traders are distress'd by them in all Places as well City as Country and this necessitates them to apply in this Manner for some new Law in a more summary and direct Manner to convict and suppress them and particularly to ascertain what kind of Traders and how Trading shall be adjudg'd Pedlars in the Sense of the Law as for the Methods to limit and restrain these People we will not pretend to lead That Part is entirely to be left to and adjusted in such a Manner as to the Honourable House of Parliament shall appear Reasonable and Just  CHAP VII Of the Necessity there is to suppress not the Licensed Hawkers only but all the private Traders of whatsoever Denomination and of the great Advantage it would be to the Publick to do so  IT comes now of Course to observe that tho' it is true that the Licensing these People is a manifest Grievance to Trade and by which they are encouraged to insult the Tradesmen even in those Towns and Cities where they have no legal Right no not by their Licences to Trade yet the bare taking off or repealing the Acts of Parliament for granting such Licences is not the only Subject of this humble Application  It is true that the Licenc'd Hawkers have been the Original of all or most Part of the Mischief suffered and that those Licences have in a great Measure taken off the Edge of the People's just Aversion to them believing that the Laws would not have allowed them if they had been really injurious to Trade in General or to the Shopkeepers in Particular  But this is not all from this Abatement of the People's disgust at the Pedlars and Hawkers Throngs of private Traders have broke  in upon even the Hawkers and Pedlars themselves who would not be called by the Name but do equal Mischief in plying as it were at People's Doors and that even in the greatest Cities and best governed Corporations carrying their Goods in small Parcels not to be discovered and selling them to the Ladies even in their BedChambers as effectually and fatally circumventing and anticipating the fair Traders as it is possible for any Pedlar or Hawker to do  So that tho' it is true that we complain of the Licensing and permitting the Hawkers and Pedlars as such and under the several Denominations and Descriptions given of them above and humbly hope for Relief against them by the Repeal of the several Laws granting those Licensing yet we must insist also that it is absolutely necessary to have some proper Clauses granted in such new Law as shall be made as may effectually suppress all those private clandestine Traders also otherwise the rest will be of no Effect  It is not the Men that we so earnestly move against as they are Men but as they are Injurious and Destructive by their foul Practice in Trade 'tis the Hawking and Peddling in all its various Forms and Shapes however disguised and concealed whether with or without a Licence and indeed of the two those without a Licence seem to be the most mischievous in great Towns and Cities those  with the Licence are so in Country Towns and Villages and especially at  lone Houses  as we call them Houses standing single and scatter'd about the Country  Those who Ply or Practice call it as you will in Cities and populous Towns and especially in  London  are supposed to be more in Number than those that are Licenc'd and consequently may do most Mischief besides they have the Chance to deal among the richer Sort of People and with those who have most Money to lay out so that they not only take more ready Money than the other but as they can sooner supply themselves with Quantities of the like Goods than they can who Travel farther off so they make quicker Returns and require less Stock  Every one of these Articles are Injurious to the fair Trader for all these Sums of ready Money if not thus intercepted would circulate in a regular Manner in the ordinary Way of Trade and give Life and Spirit to the Shopkeeper of whatever Trades the Buyer was formerly used to deal with and the Goods pass thro' all the circulating Meanders of Trade which are known so much to support the Body of our Tradesmen  This is a Reason well worthy the Consideration of the Legislature and which if duly Weigh'd would shew the Necessity of suppressing these People namely that by this they  will restore Trade to its ancient State such as it was when the Wealth and Oppulence of this Nation was first raised for we must insist that the Greatness of our Country has been chiefly if we may not say wholly raised by our Trade  The Increase of our People the raising the Value of Lands the infinite Improvements in Cultivation in Navigation in Arts in Manufactures and in a Word in every valuable Thing has been all under Providence owing to our Trade and of all Trade our Home Trade is the Life the Soul and the Support of all the rest  This Home Trade is wounded weaken'd we may almost say murther'd by these Pyrates and by their Depredations it languishes like Children without the Breast the Stream as is said above is turned away from the Mill the Buyers or Customers are turned away from the Shops the Money which was the Life of their Trade runs into other Hands If any Trade is left to the Shopkeeper it is the trusting Part where the Money comes slow and where Losses often falls heavy so that the Shopkeeper has the Gleanings of the Trade while the Pedlar and the Hawker have the Harvest the Shopkeeper has the Milk and the Pedlar the Cream  With these Disadvantages in the Trade the poor decaying Shopkeeper has a large Rent to pay and Family to Support he maintains  not his own Children only but all the poor Orphans and Widows in his Parish nay sometimes the Widows and Orphans of the very Pedlar or Hawker who has thus fatally laboured to starve him How often when they perish in their unjust Dealings are their Wives and Orphans past home to the Parishes for the injured opprest Tradesman to help maintain  Were these People remov'd Trade would soon return and revive when once Trade came to flow in its right Channel it would recover its former Magnitude and Glory and the Shopkeepers would thrive again as they formerly did  We have had abundance of Inquiries made into the Reason of the decay of our Trade and the declining of our Tradesmen why so many Commissions of Bankrupts are granted why the Goals are however frequently empty'd so soon fill'd again with demolish'd Tradesmen and broken Shopkeepers we must say we think they go round about in seeking for the Cause who look any farther than to this unhappy miserable Invasion of Trade by Vagrants and Thieves  These are the People who ruin both the Buying and the Selling the selling Pedlar robs the fair Trader of his ready Money Customers and the Smuggling Pedlar robs him of his buying to Advantage They buy of the Smugglers who by robbing the Government of the Customs  bring in Goods from the Foreigner and the Profit at least great Part of it goes away to Strangers they have the Market and we the Loss for it is evident much of the Smuggling Trade is managed by Foreigners They bring the Brandy the Salt the Tea the Coffee to our Coast and into our Ports we that is our Thieves go on Board and buy and tho' they may buy cheap compared to the Price which the fair Trader pays yet they pay dear compared to what the Foreigner can afford to sell for  We might enlarge upon the Proof of this by enquiring into the Trade for Brandy in small Casks carried on for some Years past by the  Jersey  and  Guernsey  Men by the Isle of Man Merchants and several others But 'tis enough to name them the rest is too well known to need any Explanations  Were these Hawkers private and clandestine Traders effectually suppress'd by Law all these Evils would be at once remov'd and as is said above Trade would be restored to its antient Channel and would of Course revive and enrich the whole Nation On this Account it is that we say it is a thing of Value sufficient to move the Consideration of the whole Legislature and with that Confidence we presume thus to lay it before them  CHAP VIII Of the Numbers of the People employ'd thus in clandestine Trade and whether it be just to throw so many Hands out of Business and perhaps out of the Kingdom since Numbers of Inhabitants are the Wealth and Strength of a Nation  NUmbers of People are without Question the Strength and Wealth of a Nation we most readily grant the General  But then it must be Numbers of legally settled Inhabitants not Numbers of Vagrants and wandering People Settled Inhabitants are Industrious Laborious and lend their helping Hands to all the Exigences of the whole Body whether Publick or Private They pay their just Proportions in all Rates Assessments and Taxes as well to the Government and to the Church as to the Maintenance of the Poor to the Repair of Highways Bridges publick Edifices and whatever the Community calls for  These are the Inhabitants whose Numbers are of Import in a Government and if we had two Millions or three Millions of such  more than we have the Kingdom would be still so much the Richer and Stronger These all live by honest Means carry on lawful Employments and support their Families by Industry and Application in their respective Callings and if they have not Estates before Hand oftentimes raise Estates by their own Genius and Inclination to Business  This very Argument therefore is on our Side with all imaginable Advantage for if these fair Traders are the People in whose Numbers and Encrease the publick Oppulence so really consists and such it is plain the Manufacturers Artifficers Shopkeepers and Retailers are as well in the Cities as in the Countries then it must certainly be the Wisdom of every Government to nourish and preserve them and by all just Assistance of Laws and Magistrates to keep them from being supplanted and opprest by unfair and clandestine Traders As for the Numbers on the other Side how many soever they may be said to be they are not to be nam'd in comparison to the Multitudes who are injured and oppress'd by them as we shall observe presently on the other Hand to the Question of what shall become of them the Answer is short and direct  Let them settle themselves fix their Habitations open Shops and Trade fairly as others do The Country is open and the Trade is open indeed the exclusive Privileges  of some Places may here and there shut them out but there is room enough for them to come into Business almost where they please and were they inclined to do so and become fair Tradesmen as others do deal in a regular Manner and carry on their Business as other Dealers do we doubt not but such Clauses might be obtain'd in their Favour as to take away all Excuses for Pedling and Smuggling from them But it is not in their very Nature as Pedlars as it is not in the Nature of Beggars to Work so after a Man has once commenc'd Pedlar he can no more fall into Trade in a fair and legal Way than a Fish can live out of Water  We know they pretend they are shut out of the great Trading Cities Towns and Corporations by the respective Charters and all other settled Privileges of those Places But we answer that tho' for want of legal Introduction they may not be able to set up in Cities Corporations  c  yet there are many Places of very great Trade where no Corporation Privileges would obstruct them of which presently  If any of them should be reduc'd and as some alledge be brought to the Parish to keep that is to say their Wives and Children the Manufacturers the Shopkeepers who confessedly make up the principal Numbers of those Corporations and are the chief Supporters of the Parishes will be much  more willing to maintain them than to be ruin'd by them  But to return to the great Objection about the Numbers of them we insist that it is all a Delusion Nor are the Numbers of those People so great as to be nam'd in Competition with the Numbers of the People who suffer by them They are numerous indeed when we speak of the Injury they do for a small Number may ruin a greater and a few are sufficient to do Mischief to a whole Community but we say they are so few compared to the very great Numbers of the Tradesmen and Manufacturers who are oppress'd by them that we are not affraid humbly to referr that Part to the just Consideration of the Parliament who cannot be at a Loss for good Reasons to dismiss them from the Destructive Trade which they now carry on and to find some other way to provide for their Numbers or to employ their Numbers such as may render them useful to their Country not Destroyers of it  That they are Destroyers as they are now station'd in Trade is out of all Doubt As Smuggling is to the fair Merchant so Pedling is to the fair Shopkeeper one cheats the Government of their Duties and the other cheats the Shopkeeper of his due Profits in Business the one turns the Channel of Trade from the Wholesale Man and from the Retailer to the Pedlar the other turns the  Merchants Trade from the Importer to the Smuggler But this is sufficiently explained already we mention it again here to inforce the present Argument that their Trade and Practice being in its own Nature unjust and ruinous to the Community the Numbers that may be concerned in it ought to be so far from a Plea for their Continuance that on the other Hand it is the strongest Plea imaginable for their being supprest  The greater the Evil is the more pressing is the Complaint and the more moving in Favour of the Complainer if their Number indeed was formidable if we could be so weak as to suppose that it would not be safe to attempt them we should talk in another Dialect of them and they might go on till the whole InlandTrade of  England  was dwindled into Pedling and Hawking as it is at this time in  Poland  and  Lithuania  and other Countries on that Side of the World  But the Case is just the Reverse in  England  they are a great Number indeed considering them  qua Pedlars  and they do an incredible Mischief to our Trade but they are a most contemptible few when we view them in the Hands of Justice and should the Parliament think fit to disarm them of their Licences or legal Claim to this walking Employ and add some needful Clauses to put a stop to the clandestine unlicenc'd Rabble which now break in upon us the fair Traders will  never want any Aid but that of the Civil Magistrate and his Peace Officers to crush the whole Body of them nor unless by any flagrant Crime they merit farther Justice will they that are refractory need any other Goal than the Cage or other Punishment than the Stocks or the WhippingPost  It is true the Mischief is much greater to Trade than otherwise it would be because of the unhappy Temper of those who deal with and encourage these private Traders we mean  the Buyers  who being sometimes gratified with the Advantage of buying a prohibited or clandestinely run Commodity in which they think they have what they call a Pennyworth not only admit them freely into their Houses but recommend them from one to another not regarding the publick Evil which they encourage or the Damage they do to Trade in General  It is wonderful to reflect how this Humour in Trade first crept insensibly upon us and still more wonderful to think to what a fatal Degree it is increased within a few Years past Till it has sapp'd the very Foundations of our Commerce and brought a great Part of that flourishing Business which we used to call Wholesale Trade and which made such a Figure in this Nation and in the City of  London  especially to dwindle almost wholly into Pedling and PackMarkets till our Shops are shut up in a frightful Manner  and Number and instead of the Consumer going to the proper Market to clothe and equip themselves the Trade is become vaguing and ambulatory and as we said above the Shop follows the Customers not the Customers the Shop  But our Business is not to sit still bemoaning the Decay of our Trade but to apply warmly and vigorously to the Remedy and to implore the Aid of our happy Representatives in whose Power it is and prevail with them to find out for us the proper and immediate Specifick for this chronical Disease  It is our Happiness that in this Application we can make it appear that we do not speak our own Sentiments alone or the Language of the Cityonly tho' that great Body consisting of the principal Merchants and Wholesale Dealers in  England  might be well supposed to understand the true Interest of Trade in General as well as of their own Trade in Particular  But the Complaint comes from all Parts of the Kingdom even the most remote and we have Letters from Places the most distant from one another and who have no Correspondence with one another yet all concurring in the same Complaint and praying the Aid of the Citizens of  London  and  Westminster  in pushing on their earnest Applications to the Parliament for Redress of this Grievance  Some of our Letters express in a most feeling and affectionate Manner the great Concern  they are under in the Country from the Apprehensions may we not call them just Apprehensions that their Trade will be entirely ruin'd and lost by the pushing on this destructive Method of Selling by Hawkers and Pedlars  Were the Numbers of People not to mention the Weight and Value of them as Tradesmen Manufacturers and Shopkeepers but to be suggested who have already sent and would upon the least Hint of the Occasion send up their earnest Complaints in this Case should we but suppose what a Porportion they bear to the whole Body we should no more speak of the Numbers of the Pedlars and Hawkers who would be distress'd by this Law The Question would be as gross as it would be to ask whether a Thousand People should suffer or a Hundred Thousand whether  in a Word  twenty Thousand or a Million the Numbers of the Shopkeepers Manufacturers and fair Traders bearing to that of the Pedlars as much difference in Proportion as that and much greater  If then the Numbers of the Pedlars or their Weight in the common Wealth can bear no Proportion to the Numbers of the Shopkeepers and Manufacturers who are thus injuried by their Means what have we to consider on their Account The only thing that remains seems to be to recommend it to them to seek Employments for themselves and to get  their Bread by some other and more honest Way of Business that may not expose them to the just Resentment of their Country and cause them to be treated as Enemies  Why may we not as well pity the brave Body of Soldiers and Seamen which upon the Conclusion of a War are usually reduc'd disbanded and sent Home oftentimes without Money or with but very little and who are left to seek their Bread where 'they can get it The Law does not spare them if they Rob and Plunder or commit any of the ordinary Excursions usual in the Armies and in the Field and tho' they may be said to have deserv'd well of their Country they are not supposed to be injured neither are they injur'd that they are left destitute of Business and have their Bread to seek  How much less then are these People used ill who are only disbanded from a really injurious and in its Nature unlawful Trade but are left at Liberty to turn honest Men and apply themselves to other Business for their Subsistence  Nor can they plead that they are Cripples and disabled from Labour or superannuated and past using other Means for they that are able to travel the Country loaden as they generally are with heavy Packs and Parcels of Goods carrying them from House to House and from Town to Town cannot be supposed to be weak Bodies and unfit for Labour on the contrary  most of them are lusty young strong and able for Labour and enur'd to Hardships and as for those that have and travel with Horses they are generally Men of some Substance and may be supposed able to take Shops as we have said settle in Towns and become honest Tradesmen among their Neighbours  If there are any poor among them who merit Regard the Method for them is plain and easy  viz  They may be pass'd Home to the respective Parishes to which they belong where even the Shopkeepers themselves tho' so much injur'd by them will be willing to assist to their Maintenance in a legal Manner  Thus either way the Oppression will be light if it may be called an Oppression the greatest Grievance to Trade that ever did or ever can befal it in this Nation would be redrest and the Pedlars becoming honest Shopkeepers would be so far from being the Pest and Grievance of the Towns and Parishes that they would set their Shoulders to the common Burthen and be the Support of that Commerce which before they destroy'd  All which is Most Humbly Sulmitted  c
