 A SERMON Preach'd at the PARISH CHURCH OF St PETER  's Cornhill  On the  SUNDAY  after the late Dreadful Fire in that Neighbourhood  By  THOMAS FRANCKLIN  M A  Fellow of  Trinity  College  Cambridge  Publish'd at the Request of the  VESTRY  of the said Parish  LONDON Printed for R FRANCKLIN in  Russelstreet CoventGarden  Price Six Pence  TO THE Worthy Inhabitants of the Parish of St  Peter  's  Cornhill  GENTLEMEN  IN Compliance with your Request I have publish'd the following Discourse That it was not design'd for the Press will perhaps appear but too plainly in the Perusal I am satisfied your kind Acceptance of it was more owing to the interesting Nature of the Subject and the Seasonableness of the Application than to any Merit in the Performance That it may answer the End proposed to  bring forth in us all the Fruit of Welldoing  is the sincere Wish of  GENTLEMEN  Your Obliged and Faithful Servant THOMAS FRANCKLIN  ECCLES VII  Fail not to be with them that weep and to mourn with them that mourn  _AS Charity or universal Benevolence is the distinguishing Mark of our holy Religion so amongst all the various Branches of this noble and extensive Duty there is not perhaps one more truly amiable or more highly requisite in every Station and Circumstance of Life than that which I shall make the Subject of my present Discourse which as it is expressive of a sympathetic Tenderness peculiar to our Natures is most emphatically stiled  Humanity  COMPASSION or a friendly Sense of Sorrow for the Misfortunes of our Fellow Creatures was originally implanted in our Minds by the great Author of them and design'd as the Alarms of a kind and impartial Father to engage us to relieve a distress'd Brother And hence it arises that our Hearts like musical Strings feel every Vibration which is made on those of our Friend or our Neighbour and do as it were insensibly and involuntarily beat to each others Pleasures and Pains  AMONGST our modern Pretenders to Reason and Philosophy there have not indeed been wanting Men of low and contracted Minds of sullen and unfeeling Dispositions who by specious Arguments and artful Refinements have endeavour'd to degrade the Dignity of our Nature and rob us of every social Virtue Goodnature and Beneficence have been term'd Selfinterest and Dissimulation Humanity branded with the Name of Weakness and Compassion derided as a Folly  WHETHER it be owing to the false Philosophy of such Writers who so industriously blend the Colours of Virtue and Vice as to render it almost impossible to separate and distinguish them or to the natural Depravity of Mankind heighten'd and inflam'd by the ill Examples of a licentious Age or both together  is hard to be determined but certain it is that we are at present so lost in the idle Amusements or swallow'd up in the Debaucheries of the World that almost all the Ties of Nature are broken through or neglected and social Love and Affection banish'd from the Breasts of Men Alliances are made and Friendships contracted without that mutual Love and Sincerity which alone can render them lasting or agreeable We are willing enough to  rejoice with them that rejoice  to partake of the Happiness and good Success of others but will not  weep with them when they weep or mourn with them that mourn  Men in short are but too well acquainted with the Follies the Vices and the Faults of their Neighbours and only Strangers to their Misfortunes  THERE are Ills enough says the selfish Man cruel and unavoidable Ills which fall to my own Share why then must I increase the Burthen by bearing the Weight of others  Sufficient for my Day is the Evil thereof  Thus trifling and insignificant are the Arguments of these Men who would shelter their Pride and Inhumanity under the Mask of Prudence and dress up the low and sordid Vice of Selfishness in the Habit of Virtue Such have little Title to the Benefits of that Nature they partake of but are to be look'd on as Limbs cut off from the Body of Society as wither'd and sapless Branches which  yield neither Shade nor Fruit  fit only to be hewed down and cast into the Fire  TRUE  Religion and undefiled before  GOD says our SAVIOUR  is this to visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction  A Religion which as he taught he practised also He was himself a  Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief  Surely he hath born our Sorrows and suffer'd for our Iniquities and shall we not shew that Compassion to our Fellowcreatures which he so tenderly bestow'd on us or dare we flatter ourselves that if we neglect this impartial Duty the same allseeing GOD who condemns our Inhumanity will not also punish our Ingratitude  WEEP  with them  says the wise Man that is with all them  that weep  He does not say with our Parents our Relations or our Children but embraces the whole Range of Nature and takes in all Mankind Even our Enemies are to be pitied and relieved If the Man who hath injured us falls into Affliction we are no longer to consider him as an Adversary whom we hate but as a Fellowcreature we must assist We may remember he is not our Friend but we must not forget he is our Neighbour  BUT if the Motives of Reason and Religion are not sufficient to persuade us SelfInterest which  reigns in every Breast will exert her Powers to excite us to it The Tear we refuse to shed over the miseries of others GOD and GOD only knows how soon we may stand in need of  Great Travail is created for every Man and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of Adam from him that sitteth upon a Throne of Glory to him that is humbled in Earth and Ashes  How often does an unexpected Stroke of Fortune put an End to the most extensive Views of Happiness and change the chearful Scene of Joy and Comfort into a melancholy State of Misery and Despair If therefore we do not pity those who are in Affliction when we fall into it ourselves who will pity and relieve us Then shall we remember the Afflictions of  Joseph  and say as his Brethren did when they came into Trouble  We are very guilty concerning our Brother in that we saw the Anguish of his Soul when he besought us and would not hear therefore is this Distress come upon us  What black and obdurate Hearts must those Men have who can look with Indifference and Unconcern on the Misfortunes of others Can such Men be honour'd esteem'd or trusted in any of the Affairs of Life Shall we not be always apprehensive that Villany and Perfidiousness must be the Companions of Pride and Inhumanity Surely to be insensible of the Miseries of others is the next Step to rejoicing in them and the Man who neglects us when unhappy would not scruple to make us so  THAT the Duty I am recommending is an important and a necessary one every impartial Man is I believe sufficiently convinced That it is also easy and delightful is a Truth scarce less selfevident It is equally attainable by every Man in every Station and Profession A Science which requires no Superiority of Wealth Parts or Knowledge to make us Masters of We have not all of us Riches to bestow on the Indigent we cannot impart Health to the Sick or restore Youth to the Aged but we have all of us Eyes to look upon Hearts to feel for and sympathize with Tongues to speak to and comfort the Afflicted  HOW great an Aversion soever the gay and unthinking Part of Mankind may have to all that is grave and melancholy it may with the greatest Truth be asserted that he who is a Stranger to Sorrow is a Stranger to the best Emotions the noblest Feelings the human Heart is capable of receiving In the Cup of Affliction there is always a Cordial thrown in by Providence to make the Draught less bitter and the very Tears of Virtue administer a more solid Satisfaction to a right Mind than Vice and Folly have Power to bestow There is in some Men a remarkable Tenderness of Disposition and a Delicacy of Sensation which those whom we falsely term the Brave and Resolute are too often Strangers to a Disposition which however we  may sometimes ridicule and despise is what will in the End most intimately unite and endear them to us Those Things which in Health and Prosperity may raise our Laughter and Contempt in Sickness and Adversity meet with our Esteem and Approbation and we seldom know the true Merit of Compassion till we feel the Want of it  AS big with Ills as human Life is yet by the Observance of this short and important Precept of my Text half the Miseries of Mankind might be softened or removed for there is scarce a Misfortune we are liable to here to which the Society the Sympathy and Condolement of a sincere Friend cannot administer some Relief  IN Poverty In Affliction in Sickness and in old Age  IN regard to Poverty it must indeed be confess'd that the best Method of shewing our Compassion to those who labour under it is to supply their Necessities the happy Lot of the Fortunate whom GOD hath blessed with Abundance But this is not the only Means by which the Poor may be relieved We may  weep with them when they weep and mourn when they mourn  and the tender Tear shed by the good Man over the destitute and unhappy may perhaps give him as  much Consolation as that Alms which the Proud and Unfeeling bestows on him from Ostentation  IN Regard to Afflictions it may be observ'd that amongst those which daily surrounds us there are some of so oppressive and violent a Nature as to sink the Soul into a State of the deepest Melancholy and Despair This is for the most Part the Time when the Mind too sore to admit of Consolation will yet find some Relief in the Condolement of a Friend Tho' we cannot heal the Wound we may yet pour a Balm into it to mitigate the Pain and here the Text points out the exact Method and Measure of our Duty We must  not fail to weep with them that weep  At such a Time Wit would be odious and Mirth unseasonable We are to behave in a Manner suitable to the Situation of those we visit to make use of all the Arts which Friendship can suggest to soften their Sorrows to calm the Tempest of their Grief and sooth them if possible into Rest Resignation and Forgetfulness  IF the Sympathy and Society of a Friend can afford Comfort in Poverty and Affliction no less is its Efficacy in the unavoidable Ills of Sickness and old Age and I appeal to the Hearts of all who have languish'd under any of those Distempers our weak Frames are subject to if ever the Sight of their Friends was so pleasing  to their Eyes or the Voice of those they lov'd so sweet to their Ear as when they came in that melancholy Hour of Distress to visit and relieve them  BUT if we even escape those cruel Disorders that are the common Portion of Humanity which how few do Experience will testify there is after all the Disease of old Age to be encounter'd with and in that Train of Ills which attend there is not perhaps a greater than that Solitude which generally accompanies it The old Man has seldom any Amusements but his own Reflections any constant Companions but his Infirmities Even the Bonds of natural Affection and the Ties of Kindred are found too weak to hold the Impatience of Youth by the Side of Age and Imbecillity Here then above all should we exercise the Duties of Humanity and Compassion to support the Steps of the Feeble to raise the drooping Head and chear the afflicted Heart Such humane and tender Offices we shall all if we live expect ourselves They make the Burthen of Years more tolerarable smooth the Bed of Death and teach us to resign Life with Calmness and Tranquillity into the Hands of HIM that gave it  IF ever there was a Time for the Subject of my present Discourse to demand your most serious Attention if ever the Virtues of Humanity and Compassion had room to exert all their  Power and shine with distinguish'd Lustre it is at this remarkable and melancholy Season The very late dreadful and unforeseen Calamity which has so alarm'd and terrify'd us and from which we are ourselves by the Blessing of GOD so miraculously deliver'd call upon me to point out to you but too many most deserving most unhappy Objects of your Commiseration The innumerable the almost irretrievable Miseries which Scenes of this Kind are productive of cannot be conceived much less express'd I need not I believe exhort you to condole with to relieve and support by all the Means in your Power the unfortunate Sufferers Terror and Affright have hitherto been the only Sensations they were capable of receiving They have not yet been sufficiently at Leisure to feel themselves unhappy or found Time to count their Misfortunes When those Hours come I trust we shall not want Tears to  weep with  or unfeigned Sorrow to  mourn with them  and in the mean Time it highly concerns us to look narrowly into ourselves That we are now here that we possess our Lives and Properties in Safety whilst almost every Thing round us lies buried in Ruin and Desolation is a signal Instance of the Divine Mercy in our Behalf  ALL the Parts of this great Metropolis which have escaped the Fury of this cruel Disaster ought doubtless with Hearts full of Gratitude sincerely to acknowledge the Hand of Providence  in their Preservation But it hath pleased GOD that the small the fortunate Number of those to whom I now address myself are by a Peculiarity of Circumstances those who of all Men have the most Reason to return Thanks to Almighty GOD for his late Mercies vouchsafed unto them What Praise and Thanksgiving what Wonder and Adoration is not due to that gracious Being which hath thus preserved us who when the devouring Flame had spread Misery and Destruction on our Right Hand and on our Left when there was nothing but Tears and  complaining in our Streets  and we expected every Moment to be swallowed up in the general Ruin thus stopt it just at our Doors and said to the destructive Element  Hitherto shalt thou go and no further  LET us then  sin no more lest a like or perhaps a worse Thing happen unto us  Let the Storm which hath blown over us and the Danger we have escaped teach us the Things which belong to our Peace Let them stir us up to the important Duties of our Religion Let us apply ourselves more earnestly to Prayer and Thanksgiving I am sure we shall be of all Men the most undeserving and ungrateful if we do not now frequent this House of GOD when it is to his gracious Mercy alone we are so visibly indebted for the Preservation of it A Blessing our unfortunate Neighbours are deprived of who have  not a  St  Michael  's Church was so much damaged by the Fire as to make it impossible to perform Divine Service there till repaired  Place of public Worship left wherein to send up their sad Prayers to GOD for Succour under their Afflictions  To him therefore who saved us when we had well nigh perished let us give as we are most bounden continual Thanks beseeching Him to grant that this his Tenderness towards us may fill us with the most lively Sense of his Goodness and the sincerest Acknowledgment of it that we may lead a new Life following his Commandments and walking henceforth in his Holy Ways  THAT as thou O GOD hast in the Midst of Judgment remember'd Mercy as thou hast saved  our Souls from Death our Eyes from Tears and our Feet from falling  we may laud and magnify thy Holy Name praise bless and glorify thee and finally that as thy Goodness hath interposed to save us in this World thy Mercy may preserve us in that which is to come through JESUS CHRIST our LORD  FINIS
