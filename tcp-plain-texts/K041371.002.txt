SOUL AND BODY  HITHERTO we have examined the different functions and me∣chanism of the body we have consider∣ed the soul in its faculties we have fol∣lowed these faculties in their unfolding and exercise in a word we have endea∣voured to discover the nature of the soul and body by their effects  Although this does not convey the full science of Man it is yet its proper ground work and without it we should in vain attempt to explain the arcana of human nature so that the greatest philosophers without this guide may be said to wander amidst thick darkness A philosophic en∣quirer will indeed at times perceive some feeble glimmerings of light but will ne∣ver acquire a perfect knowledge of the subject he will only collect some scatter∣ed ideas and unconnected truths without  any relation the one to the other Having therefore considered Man in the differ∣ent substances of which he is composed let us now consider Man properly so called try to discover the reciprocal influence of these two substances and endeavour to in∣vestigate the causes of their wonderful re∣lations But before we attempt to reason on the causes we must first ascertain the effects We shall therefore confine our∣selves to a precise and simple exposition and reduce our observations to those facts which are clear and well supported  All the parts of nature are connected air water earth plants minerals ani∣mated and inanimate substances are all linked together by some correspondence between causes and effects every being in the universe is related to some other and even the great Author of nature him∣self But in no possible union of beings have any two been joined of more opposite na∣tures or whose connexion is more intimate than the soul and body neither have any two beings a greater or more extraordinary reciprocal influence  All beings act one upon the other not by a blind and fortuitous energy but by  constant and immutable laws of this na∣ture is the action of the soul on the bo∣dy and of the body on the soul in all animals  How plainly soever this influence may appear it has not been examined with sufficient care and attention although on such an enquiry depends the knowledge of the principles and laws of this mysteri∣ous influence I shall therefore apply myself to a cateful examination of these relations and as neither the soul nor the body is a simple being as each of these substances is in itself compound  I say compound and desire the reader not to be alarmed The soul is undoubtedly a compound being although metaphysicians maintain it to be a simple one but not compound in the same sense with the body its component parts are the different faculties moreover observe that the term compound does not imply ma∣teriality nor any way contradict the spirituality of the soul  and as their constituent parts do not all act to∣gether that I may not proceed without a plan I shall distinguish their particular influence and treat them as distinct ob∣jects In the prodigious multitude of ob∣servations which may be made on this  subject I shall range in the same class all those which have one common object connect particular observations with those which are general and collecting them into one whole endeavour to give a con∣cise yet complete history of the reciprocal influence of these two very different sub∣stances  SECTION I  Of the Power of the  BODY  on the  SOUL  Man has two modes of existence viz sleeping and waking  Sleep is properly only a mode of the existence of the body in which every function of its organs is suspended except that of the organs of life in waking every spring of the machine is or may be in action In both these states the soul perceives thinks recollects and all its faculties are in exercise but their exercise is performed differently in each of these states Let us therefore examine the re∣lations of the soul to the body and of the body to the soul both when sleeping and waking  Of  SLEEPING  Observation I As sleep approaches the vivacity of our motions decays the weary limbs relax and yield to their own weight the head gradually declines on the shoul∣der a sentiment of pleasure steals on eve∣ty organ and we seem to feel the gentle motion of the blood as it flows through the veins The senses are now inactive but no part is yet asleep sensibility gra∣dually leaves the organs at length the eyes yield to the pleasing influence of the God and a refreshing calm reigns through∣out the body The soul likewise partakes in this enchanting stillness forgets every thing even itself and imperceptibly sinks into insensibility But in this universal repose the mind is not inactive its ope∣rations are only less sensible the sensa∣tions are weak so likewise are the senti∣ments and ideas and the more so in pro∣portion as the sleep is deep  Freed from the power of the senses the soul now enjoys its liberty it thinks but its thoughts are irregular incoherent un∣connected and from their assemblage are formed those phantastic images those  whimsical representations those phan∣toms and flitting shades which constitute our nocturnal illusions  II In sleep thought freely rambles over all kinds of objects and imagination appears to be the only acting power Al∣though the soul at that time appears to be entirely freed from all subjection to the body the disposition of the corporeal organs always determine the nature of the dream If the sensation then felt by the body be agreeable there is a continual series of pleasing illusions and flattering images On the contrary if the sensa∣tion be painful a succession of frightful ideas and hideous objects haunt us during sleep monstrous phantoms scenes of blood and death appear ghosts goblins and horrible spectres terrify us  The influence of the body is not con∣fined to the nature of the objects of our dreams it likewise regulates their conti∣nuance If the body is afflicted with any languishing disorder these spectres and these phantoms seldom disappear and seem to haunt us continually On the contra∣ry if the body is affected by any acute disorder the illusions are transient the  phantoms assume many different forms and succeed each other very rapidly  There is something yet more wonder∣ful in the analogy between the dream and the then present sensation  If we at any time experience during sleep those pleasing titillations which the semen when redundant produces on the organs of pleasure we fancy we see agreea∣ble objects that we hold converse with beautiful fair ones in inchanted groves they that expose all their virgin charms to our fight and withhold nothing from our desires In painful sensations appear phenomena equally surprising whereof every one doubtless has had expe∣rience against his will  When we lie in an uneasy posture where∣by respiration is oppressed and the circu∣lation of the fluids obstructed we dream of being pursued by enemies spectres sor∣cerers devils whilst we have not the power to fly  In the heat of a fever we dream that we are perishing with thirst that we tra∣verse immense regions in search of foun∣tains without finding any and that when we have found one we apply our  parched lips to it but the water flies back and all our efforts to allay our thirst are in vain so that like  Tantalus  we perish through want amidst the greatest abun∣dance  III In dreams we think much feel more and reflect little the sensations and images succeed each other with rapi∣dity but the soul neither compares nor remembers them  IV Although in general the soul re∣flects but very little during sleep the de∣gree of reflection is not the same in every individual The ideas which strongly affect us whilst awake are retraced in the mind during sleep and we continue to combine them Thus geometricians form and combine figures poets make verses and philosophers reason  Of  WAKING  V When the body has been refreshed by rest the organs of sense insensibly re∣sume their functions the pulse gradually quickens the face regains its colour and by degrees all those vain images enchant∣ed regions and ideal objects disappear  in fine Man opens his eyes and is con∣scious where he is  I have said that the exercise of the fa∣culties of the soul is not performed dur∣ing sleep as when we are awake and even when we are awake it is not al∣ways performed invariably in the same manner  VI The soul grows weary just as the body does When fatigued with too in∣tense or too long application it loses in some degree the faculty of applying itself to one subject the ideas become weak and languid there are no more sallies of wit no more flights of genius In this state should we force attention immedi∣ately every thing in the mind is effaced we no longer think we fall into a kind of le∣thargy and a kind of insensibility  When the body is fatigued its motions no longer retain their vigor all its func∣tions are weakly performed external ob∣jects produce only weak impressions on its organs and the sensations have neither force nor vivacity  VII The mind not only becomes fatigued like the body but what is most singular they become both fatigued at the same time  The fatigue of the body is always accom∣panied by the fatigue of the soul and the fatigue of the soul by that of the body the one is never unattended by the other and what is no less strange the weariness of these two substances is equal in its ex∣treme degree only  Is the body fatigued to excess the mind cannot give attention to any object its perceptions are weak and as if passive to the objects which are presented it no longer thinks nor reflects it recollects no∣thing and frequently remembers not the impression received but the moment be∣fore the desires of the soul are weak it wills nothing strongly and seems not to retain the power of determining itself in short the soul is in a kind of drow∣siness and as it were in a reverie which wears outwardly the appear∣ance of meditation Is the mind fatigued to excess external objects produce only weak impressions on the senses and these impressions produce only weak sensations on the soul motion is painful and all the organs are in a stupor  VIII In diseases of the body we fre∣quently observe reason lost and a delirium  overtakes the soul this is evident in the hysteric affection that terrible dis∣order which afflicts the fair sex and is so singular in its symptoms  Often when the soul is engrossed by pleasure their gaiety gradually disappears and a profound sadness succeeds the sight grows dim involuntary tears flow the mouth is half open every part of the face is convulsed the limbs lose their flexibili∣ty are violently distended and the body is strongly contorted when these violent agitations which are of no long conti∣nuance cease an extreme stupor en∣sues and the countenance wears the livid hue of death when the complexion has recovered its colour insensibly the other extreme succeeds and the countenance appears inflamed the pulsation of the temporal arteries is very great respi∣ration is no longer oppressed the unhappy patient fetches deep sighs opens her eyes and stares wildly round her She at last recovers her voice and the disagreeable scene sometimes concludes in immoderate fits of laughter often in shedding tears and in shrieks and always with incoherent talk  IX Another proof of the disorder of the mind in diseases of the body is seen in a case which at present offers itself to my observation  The gay the agreeable D blessed with the gifts of fortune the beloved husband of a most amiable woman was suddenly affected with extreme sadness the consequence of immoderate venery Disgusted at every thing as if by enchant∣ment his soul receives no pleasure from the most agreeable objects nothing can engage his attention what he formerly eagerly sought after he now as eagerly avoids he shuns company and betakes him∣self to solitude shutting himself up alone in his chamber sometimes from a pensive silence he starts with terror at others he mutters some extravagant discourse to him∣self lastly when sleep has closed his eyes wearied with watching he enjoys no rest then hideous spectres appear he cries out for help and awakes in extreme terror  For ever either quite silent or raving his complexion at times is of a very lively colour his eyes protuberant as if ready to start from their sockets his looks wild his limbs violently agitated he vents his  rage on himself and is ready to tear him∣self in pieces his eyes afterwards appear sad his head reclines on his breast his arms hang down his whole body is af∣fected with a stupor again he falls into a sullen silence and melancholy bursts into involuntary tears and fetches deep sighs  But how many instances have we of this sad truth in those evils to which na∣ture has subjected us How slight a cause is sufficient to deprive man of reason  X A simple wound shall sometimes render the soul delirious  The unhappy person who has been run through the body with a sword feels an acute pain in the wounded part the pain increases and is insensibly ex∣tended to every part The body is at first slightly convulsed by degrees res∣piration is oppressed the countenance is inflamed the eyes are swoln he stares wildly round him and his limbs are vio∣lently convulsed This disorder of the corporeal organs is instantly communica∣ted to the soul every idea is disturbed in this unversal confusion the unfortu∣nate sufferer knows neither the voice of his friends nor the features of his parents  who stand round his bed attempting to awaken sentiment and recall life  In these disorders a foreign power pres∣ses on the soul and subdues it the limbs are in an involuntary agitation nor can the soul keep down its unruly emotions or restrain its transports  XI To behold the manner in which the soul partakes of the affections of the body we should almost be induced to be∣lieve it material  In our recovery after a long and high fever which has consumed the principle of strength the soul is as weak as the body the sensations have no vivacity sentiment is dull desire languid and we receive no pleasure from the most a∣greeable objects recollection is likewise decayed and we scarcely remember an action done the moment before the under∣standing is principally affected with this languor with difficulty we compare the most simple objects we cannot reflect all the faculties of the soul are in a stupor The more this disorder of the body pre∣vails the weaker is the soul as the or∣gans regain their force conception gra∣dually  returns and is not in its vigour till the body is perfectly recovered  XII Acute diseases are always attended with weak conception weak remem∣brance and weak recollection chronical diseases are accompanied with the same symptoms but this decay of recollection conception and remembrance is more sensible in that affection of the  ductus me∣dullae spinalis  called the  spina bifida  when the tumor is opened and yet more in le∣thargies  A considerable loss of the spermatic fluid produces the same phenomena Hard drinkers commonly become stupid in length of time and lose all sentiment remembrance and recollection  The unhappy persons who have been obliged to undergo the operation of the trepan apoplectics and those who have been restored to life after hanging remain for a long time stupid without remem∣brance without conception and some∣times continue for ever after of a dull un∣derstanding and unfaithful memory not even remembring the pain they felt when they suffered  XIII The same effects which are pro∣duced by diseases on the soul are some∣times produced by violent passions and sometimes by extreme application How many are rendered insensible by fear How many by too great attention to some par∣ticular object  Tasso  the celebrated Italian poet be∣came insane by extreme application to study in some measure surviving himself forgetting both his name and his works  Gallus Vibius  the famous mimic men∣tioned by Seneca  Lib Controv  lost his reason by too earnestly applying himself to the imitation of folly  XIV Finally by a kind of prodigy we observe some persons to lose one part of the powers of the soul and retain the other some lose the faculties of medita∣tion and reflection without losing the judgment others lose the recollection yet retain the remembrance as if these different powers of the mind depended on particular organs of the body  XV The  Microcephali  have less me∣mory less brilliancy of wit less penetra∣tion  than common persons whilst  Ma∣crocephali  possess these qualities in a very eminent degree as if the soul were too much confined in the heads of the former and that the spiritual faculties were ever proportionate to the volume of the organs in which they reside  XVI It is frequently observed on the relations between the body and the soul that very corpulent persons have commonly no imagination no sagacity no delicacy of wit they have only good sense When the degree of corpulency is prodigious dul∣ness nearly approaches stupidity the soul then appears to be oppressed by the redun∣dancy of matter  XVII The following singular relations between the soul and body have been con∣stantly verified by experience  A quick and penetrating mind is ever united to a  Let it be remembered that when I term a body  sensible  I mean a body endued with an high degree of sensibility  sensible and vigorous body and  vice versa  A profound and sublime mind is united to a body vigorous and strong  I speak not here of the extent of our knowledge or of the number of ideas I speak of their cha∣racters only  There will certainly appear some signs of a vi∣gorous mind in a man whose body is sen∣sible and vigorous none but those per∣sons only who together with vigour en∣joy strength of constitution know how to deliver their ideas with energy and con∣tinued force Only such could compose the Pharsalia of Lucan the Dramas of Shakespear and the energetic writings of the author of Emilius  XVIII If delicate and feeble persons have no vivacity either of body or mind and if this vivacity of mind ever accom∣pany vigour of body it is likewise cer∣tain that a body extremely delicate and sensible is ever united to an erroneous and inconsistent mind whilst we see that on the contrary a body which is robust and less sensible ever contains a mind that is proportionably the reverse  The body influences the soul several ways we not only observe striking rela∣tions  between it and our solids we ob∣serve very singular ones between the mind and the circulation of our fluids'  XIX Whilist the blood circulates with great velocity man is agitated with a kind of phrenzy raves loses his remembrance and reason his ideas are confounded and in the universal disorder which prevails in his soul he forgets his friends wife chil∣dren and even his name  In proportion as the circulation is less quick so much the weaker are the mo∣tions of the soul a gentle calm succeeds these furious transports it recovers recol∣lection and reason and the thoughts fall again into their natural order  XX Whenever the operations of the soul are well performed and the soul acts with entire liberty the blood flows with moderate velocity on the contrary it circulates with great rapidity in frenzies in strong agitations of the mind and when the lamp of wisdom is extinct  XXI When the body is violently agi∣tated it drives rest from the soul per∣sons in fevers continue sleepless many days in vain they seek for repose their firm∣ness  is exhausted and their souls soon yield to a mortal languor  The relations observed between the state of the body and the character of the mind are likewise observed between the state of the body and the character of the pas∣sions  XXII A body sensible and strong is united to a soul susceptible of violent and most durable passions  A body robust and but little sensible is united to a soul susceptible of moderate yet durable passions  A body delicate and sensible is joined to a soul subject to passions strong but of short duration  A person delicate and of strong sensa∣tions is easily kindled into rage but this is of very short continuance A vigorous and robust person is not easily inflamed but his passion when excited is of long duration the rage of the first is a fire which blazes and is soon extinguished that of the other is like the waters of the ocean which at first oppose great resist∣ance to the fury of the winds but retain their motion a considerable time when once excited  Finally a body feeble and but of weak sensations is united to a peaceful soul en∣tirely exempt from ardor which experi∣ences only the weak impulses of an inde∣termined will and knows no more of the passions than their name and  vice versa  XXIII An impetuous soul is ever united to a sensible and vigorous body a peace∣ful soul to a body robust or endued with little sensibility  But there are observed yet other rela∣tions between the state of the body and the character of the soul  XXIV In chronic disorders and dur∣ing a state of convalescence after acute  I mean those acute diseases which disorder all the functions of the animal oeconomy not those that affect a part only  diseases the soul is languid like the body nor can any thing give it pleasure ob∣jects which delighted before no longer excite any emotion the mind is melan∣choly thoughtful and sullen whilst Man in vigorous health is gay lively and fickle Excessive loss of semen in the male likewise affects the soul with sadness and languor  You can hardly know under that de∣jected that pensive and melancholy air effects of immoderate venery the man who before was so sprightly and so gay  The fire which sparkled in his eyes is extinguished the liveliness of his com∣plexion is gone and his countenance de∣monstrates the languor of his soul the days pass unperceived nothing engages his attention his drooping soul finks into that forlorn state which is the type of death Whence does this metamorphosis proceed From the loss of a small quan∣tity of the nervous fluid  XXV Diseases not only render man thoughtful and sad they sometimes steel the heart and beget inhumanity for you frequently see persons who are by nature amiable and gay rendered by some distemper restless suspicious dis∣trustful ill natured and peevish they grieve for the most trifling cause and are displeased with every thing said or done  XXVI The gay seek after agreeable diverting and comic amusements the sad those which are mournful and of a tragic nature to these joy is displeasing they would have every thing wear a face of  mourning  This observation takes place when the soul is a prey to grief and before it receives any motive of consolation but it is never more conspicuous than in men of a melancholy temper  about them they tell and hear told with a kind of pleasure tragic ad∣ventures they shun the company of the gay and retire to forests woods caves rocks deserts and to savage nature like those reptiles which feed on herbs which are poison to others  XXVII Whilst all the functions of our organs are well performed whilst the fluids circulate within us easily and with a moderate velocity the body is in health in this state the soul enjoys all the vigour it is capable of Are the func∣tions of the body changed Is the circu∣lation of our fluids languid or difficult The body is diseased man is then subject to great weakness his powers are inactive his soul is incapable of any great under∣taking he fears every thing and attempts nothing  Man in health is intrepid without it he is pusillanimous  XXVIII Immoderate coition is at∣tended with the same effects with disease  we moreover observe that males who have been deprived of the parts charac∣teristic of the sex before they were perfectly developed ever retain an effeminate dis∣position are less vivacious less brave and less fierce than those who have not been mutilated in this manner  They who have one testicle only are less lively less intrepid than those who have two they who have three are pro∣portionably more lively  XXIX But the manner in which the affections of the soul follow the state of the body is yet more surprising When a soldier in the heat of an engagement re∣ceives a mortal wound he becomes the more impetuous at the sight of his blood he is inspired with a violent passion and with new force but he soon perceives his strength to fail a freezing cold shoots through his veins all his powers decay a mortal languor succeeds his courage fails and his rage declines as the blood slows from his wound  There are other relations between the constitution of the organs and the mental character  XXX Boldness and openness of tem∣per ever accompany strength and vigour of body To obtain their desires the weak use stratagem the strong open force This may be observed even among brute animals the weak practice cun∣ning whilst the lion goes straight to his prey and attacks it openly  But between firmness and constitution we observe relations opposite to those ob∣served between constitution and boldness A delicate yet vigorous body never con∣tains a soul endued with fortitude Those fine gentlemen who are so brave at the head of their company have no firmness when they suffer any acute pain Wo∣men are more courageous but less firm than men How many heroes have con∣fronted all the dangers of undaunted war and yet have shed tears through extreme pain  XXXI A very apparent relation be∣tween the constitution and mental character is that weakness of mind always accom∣panies weakness of body  Age infancy and disease are credu∣lous women more than men they be∣lieve in witchcraft reading of dreams  palmestry old wives tales spirits phan∣toms in a word all the extravagancies of human reason  XXXII To an attentive examiner there appears a constant relation between the organization of the body and the affec∣tions of the soul  The soul united to gross organs delights in very lively amusements and noisy plea∣sures united to delicate organs it loves calm refined amusements Lively co∣lours are most agreeable to robust men such delight in warlike musick pungent odours and strong liquors delicate per∣sons on the contrary love light colours soft musick the gentle persumes of the rose and jasmin The same observation may be made with regard to the pleasures of the mind delicate persons are averse to the noisy amusements of the robust they are fond of the softer pleasures the sweet overflowings of the soul têtes à têtes and all the enjoyments which arise from the tender emotions of the heart  XXXIII If a great loss of semen in∣volve the soul in sadness and sometimes in a kind of stupid insensibility the loss of a small quantity of the nervous fluid wea∣kens  the motions of the soul and turns sentiment into tenderness After the first enjoyments the lover is without any live∣ly emotion though in the full possession of that felicity with which he was inebri∣ated a few moments before To his for∣mer violent transports succeeds a pleasing stillness his love for his mistress conti∣nues but his passion has lost its ardour he still presses her to his bosom but no longer devours her charms his caresses are more tender more affectionate and his mind being entirely engaged by pleasure views with delight those beauties which had so violently enchanted his senses  XXXIV If the body strongly influence the soul the aliments affect it in a man∣ner no less surprizing  What a power has wine over this im∣material substance By this beneficent li∣quor a calm is restored to our troubled minds it drives away pain fear suspi∣cion and introduces hope and joy in their stead By wine misfortune for∣gets its evils and consuming cares give place to pleasing illusions and agreable ideas By wine joy presides at banquets  gets possession of the hearts of the guests and breaks out in songs and merriment  XXXV The power of wine is not con∣fined to the inspiring hope and joy it likewise inspires love and renders the mind bold and free The soldier whom water could not have kept from flight having drank wine boldly meets death and bravely fights By wine are begot∣ten witty sallies and happy turns of ex∣pression spontaneously come from the lips thus wine has been esteemed the  pegasus  of poets and fable has combined Bacchus with the Paphian queen regarding wine as a principal support of love's empire  XXXVI But if this beneficent liquor when drank with moderation relieves our inquietudes inspires bravery gaiety and candour what terrible effects are pro∣duced by its excess Convulsive motions palpitation of the heart contortion of the whole body violent agitations of the soul fury alienation of mind loss of senti∣ment of remembrance and wisdom these are its too common effects  XXXVII What power have other ali∣ments likewise on the soul Let the Man who burns for amorous embraces and  whose imagination is busied with the charms of the fair sex be fed for twenty days only with aliments impregnated with acid or nitrous particles and you will observe his passion to decay with his strength Give him afterwards gelati∣nous and spirituous aliments immediate∣ly his imagination is revived and his passion renewed with its former force  XXXVIII Aliments affect not the soul by their quality only but by their quan∣tity likewise  On rising from a plentiful table Man is not the same as when he first sat down thereto  After eating the pulse becomes quick∣er we feel a pressure at the region of the stomach the body is dull and listless the mind becomes sad and heavy it is no longer adapted for meditation or sallies of wit we yawn and at last fall fast a∣sleep  XXXIX The effect produced on the soul by excess of wine is occasioned like∣wise by a small quantity of the  solanum verum  Scarce is it dissolved in the stomach when the members become convulsed the  gestures wild and the looks full of fury the  Risus Sardonicus  succeeds and tears begin to flow in the mean time the wretched sufferer stammers out many extravagant expressions is furious and endeavours to bite or tear any object that happens to be near him  The  semina hyosciami aturae indicae  deprive the person that eats them of the use of his senses he sees not even though his eyes are open he hears not is stu∣pid without ideas without sentiment he is not even sensible of his own ex∣istence  Were I to recount the different virtues of other plants and flowers which pro∣duce similar effects in the soul and which render the wisest furious and the most in∣genious stupid I should never have done  The prospect of nature produces on the soul impressions very different accord∣ing to the objects which offer themselves to the sight  XL Who can be insensible to the pleas∣ing sentiments which arise in the soul from the prospect of a beautiful landscape from the view of a fine country enlightened with the parting rays of the sun in the evening  of a serene day We feel a sudden joy a satisfaction which cannot be expressed The rich foliage of the trees the enamel and persumes of the flowers the harmoni∣ous chant of birds and the coolness of the evening breeze insensibly beget gaiety in the heart we feel a sweet serenity steal upon the mind we undergo a kind of enchantment which it is impossible to resist  I know we are not at all times in an equal dispo∣sition to receive this joy to feel these pleasing emo∣tions there are moments in which we tenaciously re∣tain in the heart some perplexing sentiment of sadness which we continually carry about with us    XLI As the prospect of a fine country of a pleasing rural recess is adapted to inspire us with joy so the prospect of a dismal desert is adapted to inspire us with sadness  Plains without flowers without her∣bage covered with arid sand trees blasted or obscured with gloomy foliage enor∣mous masses of rocks divested of verdure and grown black with age the noise of torrents rushing from the summit of moun∣tains together with the croaking of ra∣vens and mournful cries of eagles are hi∣deous  objects which convey sadness to the heart though all the senses  XLII As the prospect of nature so the air affects the soul in different manners according to its different temperature  Is the atmosphere thick and heavy We feel a sadness at the heart which vanishes as soon as the air is restored to its wonted serenity In the most delightful retire∣ment we are obnoxious to the influence of the atmosphere and are gay or sad according as the heavens are cloudy or se∣rene The air even affects our sensibility and understanding in cold and dry wea∣ther the mind is much more active more penetrating than when it is hot or humid  Milton's genius was sublime during the first and last months of the year only at other times his ima∣gination was oppressed he was then not superior to other men    Thus seeing that the soul is subject to physical laws and is under the influence of the heavens and earth we might be indu∣ced to believe that Man is wholly material Feeble sport of the air and seasons The sun and clouds heat and cold dry and humid these regulate his character the complexion  of his mind and his genius and he is gay or sad sagacious or stupid according to the influence of the winds and meteors  XLIII Agreeable sensations not only generate a sentiment of love or of joy in our hearts they likewise produce a pleas∣ing calm  If fatigued during the heat of summer we repose ourselves beneath the branches of a tree which by its thick foliage defends us from the rays of the sun em∣ployed in viewing the enamel of the mea∣dows and a variety of delightful objects which then present themselves to our sight the gentle zephyrs with their cooling breezes refresh us the murmur of brooks the sweet perfume of flowers the amo∣rous chant of birds delight the ear and the whose soul is drowned in pleasure engrossed by sweet sensations the mind gradually ceases to contemplate the ob∣jects of its delights already thought has abandoned it the other faculties are sus∣pended and by an unknown charm we sink into a voluptuous repose the bo∣dy partakes in this enchanting calm and as if it were incapable of watching one moment without its companion the head  reclines the eyes close and sleep creeps on all the senses  Let this examination of the influence of the body on the soul suffice I shall now proceed to examine the influence of the soul on the body  SECTION II  Power of the  SOUL  over the  BODY  If the power of the body over the soul be very great the power of the soul over the body is very great likewise By a simple act of volition the soul moves the limbs either separately or all together In passions it affects the body in a thousand different manners at one time it con∣tracts either every part at once or some particular parts only at another it relaxes them and deprives them of their tone and sometimes it so far agitates our organs disturbing and varying their oeconomy as wholly to destroy it  The power of the soul over the body is as immediate as that of the body over the soul but not as complete It has indeed a direct power on the organs of voluntary motion but not on those of  life if at any time it affect these it is only indirectly by their connexion with the organs subject to the will or by the correspondence of the nervous system  Neither is the power of the soul over the body as continual as that of the body over the soul the influence of the body on the soul is permanent the influence of the soul on the body only momentary and what is surprising the body is never subordinate to the whole soul but only to some one of its faculties exclusively  I shall therefore examine the influence of the soul on our organs in its different points of view neglecting that of the will of which I have already treated when discoursing of the mechanism of the human body  The passions cannot continue confined within the heart they manifest themselves outwardly in the sound of the voice in the rapidity of the speech in the gesture in the posture of the body in the state of its functions and always differently according to the nature of the motions agitating the soul  XLIV Love whose empire extends over universal nature that violent and  tender sentiment so celebrated by the poets so well known to lovers produces strong emotions in the organs of pleasure excites a gentle heat in the region of the diaphragm  In those vascular and nervous parts termed by anatomists  plexus cardiacus  tender looks quick pulsa∣tion adds lustre to the eyes envilens the complexion embellishes the countenance animates the features and communicates a grace to all our motions  XLV In friendship the soul affects the body in the same manner the symp∣toms of the organs of pleasure excepted  We must not confound friendship with love Till the time when the organs of sex are perfectly deve∣loped Man knows only the first of these sentiments he may indeed love a female but his affection is only such as he has for his friends it being only by the se∣cret emotions of the organs of pleasure that he has the knowledge of this sweet attraction of the sexes to seek each other's company and to unite in procreative plea∣sures  nor is it strange it should friendship and love being the same affection of the soul and differing only in their object  XLVI Joy produces nearly the same effects with happy love Whilst the soul  is under the influence of this agreeable sentiment the countenance wears a graci∣ous smile the complexion is lively the eyes shine with redoubled lustre respira∣tion is more free the body receives new vigour sensibility is increased and we feel a voluptuous emotion about the heart Joy in the same manner with love em∣bellishes the countenance animates its features gives expression to its graces and vivacity to all our actions it appears like∣wise in our motions the legs the arms the head are diversely agitated as if the body and soul were not sufficiently capaci∣ous to contain its transports  Such are the effects of moderate joy when the passion is extreme they are ter∣rible an excess of pleasure affects us with languor stupifies the senses disorders the motion of our organs and nearly deprives us of all sentiment for Man faints through excess of joy as he does through extreme pain  XLVII How different are the effects of moderate joy from those of sadness Is the soul overwhelmed with sadness The countenance is pallid the eyes lose their vivacity the muscles of the face relax  we feel a tension in the region of the heart a weight on the diaphragm the circulation is impeded and becomes lan∣guid our strength fails us and all the bo∣dy is affected with a stupor  XLVIII The effects of fear on the bo∣dy are analogous to those of sadness In fear the limbs are affected with a vio∣lent tremor the blood congeals in its vessels our strength fails us the use of the senses is suspended the voice dies away on the lips languor arrests our motions our organs are in a stupor and all their oeconomy is disordered  When fear is extreme it gives youth the marks of decrepitude  The hair of some persons has been observed to turn grey instantaneously through extreme fear  it extinguishes the lamp of life In some this passion has anticipated the executioner and the ene∣my The Man who has had his irons knocked off after condemnation to receive a pardon has been found dead through excess of fear Another falls lifeless at the sight of an enemy whom he is going to encounter  XLIX If when the body is extremely agitated the soul enjoys no repose so  neither does the body enjoy any when the soul is strongly affected  When night has wrapped all things in her sable mantle Man is not always sure of rest Whilst all other creatures enjoy the blessings of repose or seek the gratifi∣cation of present wants Man is the only one to whom care denies sleep The black despair and heartcorroding remorse which agitate his soul during the day ac∣company him amidst the obscurity of the night will not suffer him to close his eyes and harrass his body continually  When the soul is strongly affected want of sleep exhausts the last remains of bo∣dily strength Thus the tender mother when her only son languishes on the bed of sickness passes whole nights and days watching her beloved child and will ad∣mit of no consolation A prey to grief she enjoys no repose her body is exhaus∣ted by fatigue and a mortal languor succeeds  If every passion makes different im∣pressions on the body the soul at once agitated by different emotions produces likewise on our organs particular impres∣sions as may be remarked in terror fear  hopeless love and in the other compound passions  L The tender virgin who sees her lover struck dead at her feet at once seiz∣ed by fear and sadness continues immove∣able a cold sweat flows down her face her discoloured lips are affected with an involuntary tremor her cheeks lose their colour her arms are extended her tear∣less eyes are immoveably fixed on the life∣less body she stands speechless astonish∣ed immoveable as if contemplating the greatness of her misery To see her mournful looks and to view her in this extremity of grief who would not imagine her insensible Soon her organs become less tense her pulse concentrated gradually becomes more free her breast heaves with frequent sighs she flings her∣self on the dead corps bedews it with her tears kisses those eyes which are now closed in the sleep of death clasps within her arms his cold remains and fills the air with her lamentation  There are cases wherein the effects of this passion on the body are yet more strong  In the war which Ferdinand made on the queen of Hungary a young warrior who had greatly distinguished himself in an engagement near Buda was carried dead from the field Rasciac an officer in the same army on viewing the body per∣ceives it to be his own son grows pale and expires  See the Essays of Montaigne    LI In attention that is in curiosity mixed with hope or fear we are agitated we hear we observe every circumstance At the least noise the heart beats the eyes are sometimes fixed and sometimes wandering Should the object appear we are seized with a palpitation of heart yet more violent respiration is obstructed the voice faulters and the functions of the senses are interrupted  LII Anger that singular affection wherein grief hatred and desire of revenge are confounded produces very different effects on the organs according to the sen∣timents then affecting the soul At one time it spreads a deathlike paleness over the countenance and agitates the body with convulsive motions and involuntary  tremors At others it gives elastici∣ty to our muscles lends us new force and for some moments raises us above our∣selves These impetuous motions of the soul are most strongly expressed in the countenance the looks are wild and fu∣rious the mouth foams the voice is in∣terrupted and hoarse the brow severe the whole face is inflamed and wears a me∣nacing air  In rage or excessive anger Man becomes frantic his motions impetuous his limbs lose their flexibility and his body is violently contorted the soul at that time raises a ferment in the blood just as im∣petuous winds rouse the waves of the sea  LIII Terror that painful emotion ex∣cited in the soul by fearful exclamations the cries of fury or the sight of imminent danger and always compounded of dread of the object terrifying us and an uncon∣querable desire to avoid it produces like∣wise very different effects on the soul At times we feel an universal tremor an ex∣treme weakness a general stupor which disable the body from obeying the soul and suspend the use of our sensations the voice faulters and dies on the lips we  make many ineffectual efforts to fly lan∣guor prevents us from moving and this stupor of the organs sometimes though but seldom destroys their mechanism At other times instead of being thus dis∣ordered this passion gives us vigor ren∣ders us more alert and endues us with a more than common force  LIV And here let us observe that every violent passion which begins by increasing the strength of the body in the end affects it with languor rage at first makes a surprizing addition to our strength but this force soon fails us we experience a weakness which deprives us both of the will and of the power of making new efforts at that time being incapable of any vigorous act we become languid and dejected  LV How different is happy and un∣happy love The hapless fair one at once possessed with love and filled with despair consumed with eager desires and de∣prived of him who alone can make her happy abandoned to her melancholy thoughts condemned to spend her life in bewailing her hopeless passion and in  feeding on her own afflictions at first perceives a tension about the diaphragm a violent heat in the region of the heart and a fever is kindled up in her veins When the heat of her passion subsides her soul succumbs under its misery a con∣suming fire rages within and deprives her of the sweets of repose her strength fails her grief preys upon her bloom and im∣pairs her health The fire which once sparkled in her eyes is now extinguished grown heavy and dim the light seems o∣dious and painful her limbs tremble and sink under her weight and she can hardly support herself the roses and lillies leave her wan cheeks her forehead is covered with wrinkles and her face wears the marks of age Some∣times her whole countenance is flustered with a glowing red involuntary tears trickle down her cheeks and so excessive is her misery that she is wholly engrossed by the sense of her sufferings and is in∣sensible to every thing besides  LVI The violent passions not only af∣fect the oeconomy of our organs they appear outwardly in involuntary motions and mechanical impressions The arms  legs head and even the whole body take different positions according to the dif∣ferent motions which actuate us In shame the head inclines forward in sadness on one side in pride it is erect it is drawn back in astonishment and in hatred and indignation it moves from side to side in different ways In anger as in joy the whole body is agitated with various precipitate motions  LVII The passions do not always act in concert they sometimes act in op∣position to each other accordingly in these conflicts they affect the body in different ways  Observe that man under some affliction of mind which he would fain smother within his own breast In this state the violence of the motions which actuate him and the efforts he makes to conceal his trouble occasion a burning heat a sen∣sation of heaviness in the head and a kind of ebriety which makes hi scarcely know himself His eyes sparkle with rage his countenance is inflamed he feels an op∣pression at his breast which obstructs res∣piration Should he during this inward struggle meet with any thing which ag∣gravates  his trouble unable to resist the emotions of his soul his limbs are va∣riously agitated he gives way to his fury and utters terrible cries with a broken and faultering voice This frenzy is frequently succeeded by more violent symptoms whilst the paroxysm lasts he reels falls remains motionless becomes insensible and has not even any sense of what he suffers  LVIII Although in these different pas∣sions the soul affects differently every part of the body yet in none are they more visi∣ble than in the countenance in none they display themselves with greater energy  When the soul is calm all the parts of the countenance are in a state of rest their union then produces a pleasing har∣mony which corresponds with the calm within But when the soul is agitated the face becomes a living table whereon every passion is delineated in the different features with equal exactness and ex∣pression  In joy the eyes acquire new lustre the complexion brightens the brows become more arched the nostrils expand the corners of the mouth somewhat recede  from each other the cheeks are gently contracted and the lips formed into a gra∣cious smile  In sadness the eyes become dead and fixed the pupil is half raised and half hid by the eyelid which is a little de∣pressed the cheeks are pale the corners of the mouth fall the lower lip is pro∣truded upwards the other muscles of the face are relaxed the visage is lengthen∣ed the eyes are swoln and dimmed by a copious moisture which is afterwards discharged in tears  In shame and in modesty the muscles of the face are contracted the eyes are turned downwards and covered with the eyelids the mouth is somewhat open and the complexion of a deeper red  If every passion is expressed on the countenance by different lineaments the concourse of these different lineaments is properly adapted to express the mixed passions  In terror and affright the forehead becomes wrinkled the eyebrows are ele∣vated in the parts towards the temples and are depressed at the other extremity the eyelids are wide open leaving the  pupil and half the white bare the lips are drawn back at their extremities the mouth is open and all the muscles of the face appear contracted and strongly mark∣ed In contempt and derision the upper lip is drawn somewhat on one side so that the teeth appear in the other is observed a small motion faintly resembling a smile the nose is drawn to the same side with the upper lip the eye on that side is half shut whilst the other continues unchanged the pupil of both being depressed as when we look downwards  Of all the parts of the face the eye is the most expressive This is the only organ wherein Man cannot conceal the passion in his breast The different pas∣sions are expressed by a sudden alteration in the eyes in these appear complacency envy rage fury contempt trouble an∣xiety despair in all their various grada∣tions  This expression of the eye is owing in great part to the different movements of the  Palpebrae  and the adjacent parts  In these too we may read vexa∣tion and discouragement in a word every affection of the soul is reflected by these admirable organs as the images of ob∣jects  by a well polished mirror even the most secret emotions of the heart are ma∣nifested by them  Every one must have observed the re∣straint of two lovers on the intrusion of a third person When they cannot freely indulge the mutual emotion of their hearts what expression What eloquence in the eye at that time the sole interpre∣ter of their sentiments How instanta∣neously does the soul display itself in the motions of these organs Their passions their designs their hopes their fears are expressed in a single glance  But it is time to leave the consideration of the influence of the sensibility of the soul on the body and to examine that of the understanding thereon  LIX Reflection fatigues the mind in∣comparably more and much sooner than musing or revery The exercise of reason is to the soul what voluntary motion is to the body a state of contention and con∣straint  LX When the soul is concentrated within itself and wrapped in profound thought we perceive a tension in the  plexus cordiacus  in the membranes of the  brain but especially in the parts surround∣ing the eyes This tension is accompa∣panied with a sensation of heat which may be removed by the action of the cold air the pulse is quicker than common the countenance becomes more florid and the breast heaves with strong respira∣tion as may be remarked in studious per∣sons or in men of strong sensations when under any violent affection of the mind and when they are obliged to retire with∣in themselves to enjoy some secret plea∣sure or to feast upon their sorrow  In a more continual application the mind is affected with a stupor or a kind of ebriety the power of the soul on the or∣gans of voluntary motion is diminished and the will loses its empire over the body  LXI How great is the power likewise which the imagination has over the body How singular the relation between this fa∣culty of the soul and our organs  It is by this that a good mimic affects the susceptible spectator and makes him follow his motions his gestures his actions mechanically just as if his body were subject to be moved by the motions of the other  It is by this the idea of delicate meats sets the organs of taste in motion and as it is commonly expressed makes the mouth water It is by this we experience that in∣supportable sensation which we feel when we are touched even on those parts which are the least sensible with design to excite titillation It is the imagination which in∣flamed by voluptuous ideas and images or by the sight of beauty quickens the pulse increases the lustre of the eye excites strong emotions in the organs of pleasure  The erection of the  penis  in man and of the  Clytoris  in woman are not voluntary motions This mechanism of the parts absolutely depends on the ima∣gination how many men are languid and impotent in the company of a woman for whom they have no af∣fection notwithstanding every effort of the will and sometimes every aid of art  and causes palpitation of the heart  It is this which in love kindles our de∣sires produces on the lips of lovers that sensation of a lambent flame which ac∣companies their kisses and renders their touch similar to that of fire  It is this which causes that tremor the lover experiences at the approaching en∣joyment of his mistress  It is this which in the ardour of youth  gratisies the voluptuousness of desire in our dreams  But the power of the imagination is not confined to any particular organ it is extended over the whole body There have been convulsionists who by the help of a warm imagination have raised themselves by degrees to fury their eyes were in∣flamed the face disfigured by a violent contraction of its muscles the mouth foam∣ing and all their members convulsed  However great this power which ima∣gination has over the body may be phi∣losophers have fancied it much greater than it really is Not content with the prodigies of nature they have attributed to it others which are merely ideal  Led aside on one hand by appearances on the other by the love of the marvel∣lous like the stupid vulgar they have adopted ridiculous prejudices and em∣ployed their pens in defending them  We are told of a pregnant woman in Germany who being struck with the sight of a picture of John Baptist which hung in her bedchamber was afterwards delivered of an infant with its whole body hairy and some physiologists treating  this absurdity as an assured fact con∣cluded that the imagination could change the form of the solids the features of the countenance and the colour of the skin  This opinion was implicitly believed and is at present universally received From thence it is pretended that whatever af∣fects the mother affects the foetus like∣wise that the affections of the soul of the one act on the body of the other to this energy are atributed the resem∣blance of children to their parents those blemishes on the skin and all those mon∣strous productions wherein nature appears to have forgotten the wisdom of her own laws They even carry their love of the marvellous so far as to assert that the foetus bears the real marks and representation of the longings of the mother as of fruits and the like which she may have eager∣ly desired But if we attentively examine these marks and blemishes these pretended signs of the mother's distempered imagi∣nation we shall perceive them to be only sanguinestains and yellow or reddish spots  These marks are always yellow or of a red or vio∣let colour tints which the blood naturally gives to the skin when it enters in too great quantity into its vascular texture and when it is more or less fluid thick or bilious and likewise according to its mixture with the nervous fluid or some other of the liquors of the body    more or less strongly expressed produced by some change in the texture of the skin  These spots have assuredly some figure because every spot must have one and this figure must necessarily bear a re∣semblance to something but they have neither the form of any fruit nor that of any object which the mo∣ther could desire  I have seen many such pretended representations of the mo∣ther's longings but could never observe in them any thing more  By investigating the causes of these pre∣judices we shall find as I have already remarked that erroneous observations only could have given birth thereto Not only the facts are false but even supposing they were true they cannot be produced by the causes to which they have been attri∣buted  I will not say to prove this that as our sensations resemble not their objects it is impossible that desire can produce physical  representations of those objects I have more convincing proofs to adduce  The soul affects the body undoubtedly in every passion and always differently according to the diversity of its emotions but it has been evidently demonstrated that the soul has no influence on the body but by the nervous fluid that this power over the body is reduced to the dilating or contracting our solids to the accelerating or retarding the oscillatory motion of the organs of circulation in different degrees sometimes even so as to destroy the motion of the whole machine and that it has no other power over the fluid of the nerves but to alter its quality and deprave it that is to render it caustic or destroy its ener∣gy Now the empire of the soul over the body which it inhabits being thus li∣mited can it be more extensive over a body to which it is not so closely united For it is well known that the  foetus  has no direct or immediate communication with the mother whilst it is in the womb it is inclosed within membranes which ad∣here not to the  uterus  in the first months of pregnancy nor is their adhesion very great when pregnancy is farther advanced  The placenta being connected to the uterus by papillae on the external part of the membranes inserted into the small fora∣mina of this organ and joined by a mucila∣ginous matter which possesses so small a de∣gree of adhesion that it scarcely  appends  to the matrix the  foetus  therefore in some respects is intirely independent of the mo∣ther  It has been for a long time believed that the blood of the mother passes into the body of the  foetus  by means of the  placenta  and  funis umbilicalis  it has been supposed likewise that the blood vessels of the uterus open into these foramina and the vessels of the placenta into these papillae and that their vessels communi∣cate with each other But experience has convinced us of the error of this opinion for by injecting the arteries of the  funis umbilicalis  the liquor injected wholly re∣turns by the veins nor does the least part of it escape into those parts with which they are supposed to communicate Be∣sides we may easily detract these papillae from their foramina without producing any efflux of blood either from the ute∣rus or the placenta there being discharg∣ed  from one to the other a lacteal fluid only which serves for nourishment to the foetus  The foetus therefore has nothing in common with the mother but this nu∣tritive lymph They have distinct and separate organs and functions nor has the mother any influence over the foetus but by means of this liquor Every alteration of this nutritive received from the mo∣ther is therefore communicated to the foetus if it be corrupt the solids and flu∣ids of the foetus are so likewise but the fluids of the mother cannot otherwise af∣fect it It is not therefore to the imagi∣nation of the mother that we must attri∣bute those resemblances those mutilations those duplicities of part those cutaneous blemishes which infants bring with them into the world and which have been com∣monly regarded as true representations of the depraved appetites of women during pregnancy  LXII Let us conclude with one im∣portant observation If we compare the power of the different faculties of the soul over the body we shall be convinced that this power is not equal in every one  that of sensibility is much greater than that of the understanding and this much greater than that of the will If the powers of these faculties be not equally great so neither are they equally exten∣sive Those of sensibility and understand∣ing are universal they extend not only to the nervous fibres but also to the fibrillae of which they are composed that is to the organs of sense and those of motion the empire of the will on the contrary is confined to this latter since those two faculties can augment or extinguish our vigour whilst the will can only extend our organs and contract our muscles  Such is in general the influence of the soul on the body and of the body on the soul such the reciprocal relations of those two substances  Although these relations are very evi∣dent many of them have escaped obser∣vation and of those who have observed any the greater number have been content with only observing them Some philosophers have attempted in vain to account for these phenomena others disgusted at the ill success of the former have regarded them as impenetrable mys∣teries  so that every one is satisfied at pre∣sent with simply observing and admiring this influence they cry it up as prodigy as if we were prohibited to pass beyond the line which those sages have drawn they likewise attribute their ill success to the nature of the discovery rather than to the erroneous methods which they have employed in pursuit of it  After the vain efforts of so many great geniuses notwithstanding so great a com∣bination of prejudices and the ridicule in∣separable from such an undertaking I will venture to attempt the explanation of these mysteries enter this dark laby∣rinth sound this immense abyss and car∣ry light into those regions of darkness I shall assign the reasons of this prodigious influence of the soul on the body and of the body on the soul display the unknown principles of their relations and deter∣mine the laws of these phenomena in a word reduce to fixed principles a science wherein every thing is yet hypothetic ob∣scure and mysterious  BOOK IV WHEREIN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL ON THE BODY AND OF THE BODY ON THE SOUL IS ACCOUNTED FOR  THE union of the soul with the bo∣dy is subject of much admira∣tion for in what manner can two sub∣stances so different from each other be united How can matter act upon the mind or the mind upon matter This is a mystery impenetrable to human under∣standing Who is so presumptuous as to undertake the explanation Human rea∣son can never conceive the first principles of this intimate union of this primitive correspondence of the soul with the body let us not seek to know after what man∣ner two beings so different in their nature and properties can act on each other we must admit the fact simply since it is unquestionable but the cause is whol∣ly unknown  Yet these different substances have sin∣gular reciprocal relations and these rela∣tions themselves must needs have causes and principles These principles hither∣to unknown I endeavour to discover and demonstrate those relations hitherto ob∣scure and incomprehensible I attempt to account for  This subject appears at first sight incom∣parably more difficult than those we have treated of already in these we arrive at truth by a direct and short way in the other on the contrary concerning which we have hitherto only vague and absurd conjectures and where demonstration ap∣pears to be impossible we may pass from hypothesis to hypothesis and blindly pursue truth in the ocean of opinions with∣out ever attaining it Yet this is not so difficult a task as it appears The influ∣ence of the soul on the body and of the body on the soul being invariably the same in the same circumstances in every individual and the relations of these two substances being similar they are there∣fore the effects of causes which operate in a fixed and invariable manner As the phenomena are subordinate to certain  laws to discover those laws we must as∣cend from the effects to the cause follow∣ing the chain of the principal phenomena collecting similar facts comparing and examining them selecting the properties they possess in common from those pecu∣liar to each Only by this method we can arrive at those causes without it the mind wanders in darkness perpetually fluctuating between prejudice and probabi∣lity ignorant of the principles of things and ever confounding the opinions of men with the laws of nature Such is the method I shall pursue in the investigation of the causes of the reciprocal influence of the soul and body I shall therefore collect the chief phenomena compare them select those which are similar and endeavour to present to the mind a cer∣tain number of analogous facts in a single point of view I shall likewise attempt to discover their identity and the cause of their analogy and finally draw from the assemblage of these different combinations light sufficient to investigate the causes and laws of the admirable harmony sub∣sisting betwixt the soul and the body  so as to conduct us to the important know∣ledge of Man  These topics being so complicated and so different in their nature I shall be un∣der a kind of necessity to pay my princi∣pal attention to the great and leading ob∣jects reducing the phenomena to some general heads avoiding to descend into mi∣nute particulars a labour as troublesome to a writer as it is unprofitable to his rea∣ders who are thus continually put to the trouble of collecting them whilst after all they receive only confused and imper∣fect ideas of the subject Besides the mind fatigued with a multitude of objects loses itself in the perplexity of its own thoughts and throws a darkness on that which it endeavours to elucidate I shall therefore confine myself to the solution of the phe∣nomena collecting them into one gene∣ral point of view disregarding those mi∣nutiae or particular questions which might cause me to lose sight of the main scope interrupt the thread of the subject and rob demonstration of its evidence  I shall likewise endeavour to present my ideas in an order equally easy to compre∣hend and interesting to pursue  I am sensible how much my system would be improved by an abler pen but if notwithstanding the mediocrity of my talents I can render it acceptable to the reader by the mere force of that evidence which attends it I shall both think the opinion I have endeavoured to establish better grounded and my satisfaction will be the more complete  SECTION I  Influence of the  SOUL  on the  BODY  WHEN the soul is affected by any sentiment it instantly affects the body always in the same manner in every individual and ever differently according to the nature of its emotions  The soul has no direct power over our corporeal organs the soul and body are distinct beings without any necessary con∣nexion and are united by the nervous fluid only  See the article on the structure of the nerves Book I  Thus in whatsoever man∣ner these substances reciprocally affect each other the soul never acts on the bo∣dy nor the body on the soul without the  intervention of this fluid and never with∣out some impulse being communicated by one to the other  See the Art on the action of the soul on the fluid of the nerves Book I  On the impulse com∣municated to this fluid on its different degrees of force combined with the elas∣ticity of the fibres and the different or∣gans affected depend the different pheno∣mena observed in the influence of the soul on the body Let us apply this princi∣ple to the effects of the passions on our organs  In joy the countenance acquires a more lively colour the eyes sparkle with an un∣usual lustre and the face wears a perpetual smile a gentle emotion is felt in the re∣gions of the heart and  plexus nervosi  re∣spiration is more free circulation more easy and quick we receive fresh vigour all the functions are more perfectly per∣formed and the whole body is full of life  As the joy is more violent these ef∣fects are more strong the arms legs head every member is strongly agitated the body can scarcely contain itself  The vivacity of the complexion the lustre of the eyes the liberty and force of  the circulation the freedom of respira∣tion and the vigour of the whole body clearly evince that in joy the soul forcibly impels a large quantity of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion This impulse of the fluid of the nerves into these organs occasioning a small intumescence of the muscular fibres  These fibres are the particular organs of motion as we have already explained when treating of the me∣chanism of the human body under the Art on the structure of the muscles Book I  and slightly com∣pressing the fluid which is contained in the fibrillae whereof they are composed gives them the whole of their organic elasticity yet causes not the least degree of rigidity Hence the muscular motion is ample and strong the heart and the arteries forcibly impel the blood into the smallest capillaries and thus communicate to the skin that slight intumescence which then so greatly conduces to beauty and to that clear and lively colour which is so greatly orna∣mental The humours of the eye receive a fresh supply of spirits and their tunics are more fully distended whereby they reflect a greater quantity of rays and ac∣quire greater lustre In the muscles of  the cheeks this impulse is principally to be seen being them supplied with a larger quantity of the nervous fluid they gently contract and with the help of the lips express an agreeable smile  But if the fluid of the nerves instead of causing a slight intumescence of the muscular fibres should violently precipitate itself in great quantity as it happens in extreme joy the fibres being then too greatly distended cannot react but they oppose a too great resistance to the elasti∣city of the fluid contained in their fibrillae These fibrillae are therefore in a state of rigidity their fluid is inactive and the entire organ without organic elasticity  Hence the reason why excess of plea∣sure stupifies the senses affects the body with languor and even destroys the ac∣tion of our organs when this state of ri∣gidity is extreme  But in moderate joy although the soul is not affected with sufficient force to oc∣casion a rigidity of the fibres these emo∣tions of the soul produce no durable im∣pressions on the body this singular vigour this flourishing state of the machine is of no long continuance and languor imme∣diately  succeeds This is easy to be con∣ceived however strange these phenomena may appear for the vigour we experi∣ence whilst affected with joy springs only from the strong influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion this fluid ceases to be determined thereto when the soul ceases to experience these agreeable emotions the fibres thus distended de∣crease and collapse when the fluid with which they were distended is dissipated and our muscles are without either tone or elasticity  It is by a similar mechanism that the handling of the breasts of females deprives them of their globular swell it excites a voluptuous emotion in the soul and in∣flames the imagination which determines the spirits thither in great abundance dis∣tends their fibres increases their volume and gives them greater firmness but as this determination of spirits is not conti∣nual if the handling be repeated when this supply has ceased the breasts presently collapse and lose their solidity  When the soul is overwhelmed with sadness the complexion becomes wan and pallid the eyes dull a tension is felt  about the diaphragm the head inclines for∣wards the arms hang down unable to support their own weight the whole body is affected with languor we sigh the eyes are suffused with tears sighs are repeated and tears flow in abundance  The greater the affliction the more evident are these its effects there is a point to which this passion is capable of arriving and where its violence sometimes extinguishes the lamp of life  If in joy the soul gives a greater elas∣ticity to the muscles by determining thereto the fluid of the nerves with im∣petuosity and in abundance on the con∣trary in sadness it appears to relax the same organs causing them to collapse by withdrawing the energetic fluid  But this is nothing but appearance on∣ly all effects of the soul on the body in this passion as in all the others are pro∣duced by the influx of the nervous fluid determined into different ducts In joy the fluid is impelled from the brain into the cavities of the muscular fibres In sad∣ness it is impelled into the fibrillae of which these fibres are formed and which we have shewn to be the proper organs of  sense In this case the nervous fluid dis∣tends the fibrillae increases their diameter compresses that of the fibres and destroys the equilibrium causing it to incline to the fibrillae hence only a small quantity flows at that time into the organs of mo∣tion and even that can have but little action  Hence proceeds the weakness of the muscles the languid action of the or∣gans the paleness of the countenance the diminished vivacity of the eyes and the stupor then affecting the whole body  These are however only the effects of a moderate impulse when this impulse is violent it occasions an extreme rigidity of the muscular fibres  This rigidity may likewise be produced by the irritating quality of the nervous fluid contracted dur∣ing this passion But it is evident that nature does not take this method for in sadness relaxation immedi∣etely sollows this rigidity whereas the irritating qua∣lity of the nervous fluid would have produced a perma∣nent rigidity  this rigidity in∣stantly produces a total cessation of the functions of the body and consequently death  But to conceive the effects of sadness properly we must distinguish those which  accompany the impulse of the nervous fluid into our organs from those which succeed it  The rigidity of the muscular fibres is the immediate effect of this impulse but to this rigidity immediately succeeds an equal degree of relaxation The universal tre∣mor affecting us upon hearing of any mis∣fortune the paleness of countenance the difficulty of respiration the oppression of the diaphragm concentrated circulation and the general stupor of the whole body are evidently the effects of a slight rigidity of the fibres The feebleness of the mo∣tions the decayed lustre of the eyes the relaxation of the muscles the lax state of the skin and the languor of all the func∣tions of the body are the consequences of that inelasticity which necessary succeeds this rigidity Hence it appears that ri∣gidity and relaxation are the causes of all the phenomena produced by the influence of the soul on the body in sadness  Hence Man in violent affliction is sub∣ject to extreme weakness hence silence and consternation are the language of the soul when strongly affected as are cries and tears when moderately worked upon  Curae leves loquuntur ingentes stupent  Hence extreme pain deprives us of sense of motion and of life itself  Although the soul affect the whole body in different passions yet it affects not all its organs equally at one time it acts most upon these at another upon those but the soul principally exercises its pow∣er on the  plexus cardiaci  These plexus are united to the most considerable blood vessels such as the trunks of the vessels of the stomach liver spleen heart and mesentery which they line with their ramifications They have likewise a direct connexion with the brain and organs of sense  In sadness when these plexus are vio∣lently contracted they forcibly compress the trunks of the blood vessels which they surround causing the blood to be collect∣ed in them and even occasioning a total stoppage of the circulation  Hence that compression of the heart that pressure about the diaphragm those syncopes accompanying the paroxysms of extreme sadness and hence even death which sometimes ensues  But when these ramifications of the nervous plexus are only slightly contrac∣ted as in moderate joy they slightly com∣press the vessels round which they are wound but principally the veins whose coats oppose the least resistance hereby the blood in circulation is somewhat re∣strained particularly in its return to the heart  Hence the emotions we experience in joy in the region of the diaphragm and that liveliness of complexion which always accompanies it  When the emotions produced on the  plexus nervosi  have a certain degree of force they communicate to the diaphragm to which these plexus are united by the diaphragmatic nerve a transient convulsive motion which produces bursts of laughter for laughter which is a sound suddenly interrupted and frequently resumed is al∣ways produced by a tremor of the dia∣phragm This motion of the diaphragm affects the lungs which it precipitately elevates and depresses every time the lungs are depressed the air is expelled through the mouth with a certain noise  this is that sound of the voice which is so often repeated in laughter  That sudden starting likewise and in∣ternal constriction which we experience when we first begin to think of some evil affecting us is produced by the contrac∣tion of the diaphragm which participates of the nature of the spasm affecting the  plexus nervosi  This constriction of the diaphragm raises the lungs and occasions that strong expiration called a  sigh  Whilst the soul continues to think upon any sorrowful subject it communicates different motions to the plexus and sighs are frequently repeated But when new impulses succeed immediately one after the other the air rushes suddenly and by intervals into the lungs produces fre∣quent expirations and every expiration occasions a sound stronger than sighing this sound frequently repeated is what is commonly termed  sobbing  When the spasms begin gradually to diminish the air is not expelled so rea∣dily from the lungs expiration is repeated at greater intervals and produces a louder sound called  groaning  for a groan is only a continued sob Finally when relax∣ation  succeeds to these spasms tears begin to flow  Tears are lymph distilled from the la∣chrymal glands situated in the orbit above the lesser canthus of the eye  Each gland has six or seven ducts which pass between the membranes of the eye∣lids and open into one common orifice near the  cilia  From this orifice distills a saline lymph which is absorbed by the  puncta lachrymalia  and discharged by its proper duct into the nose But these glands express not this liquor till they be∣gin to relax after contraction hence is the reason why moderate grief causes tears to flow and why excessive grief sus∣pends them  We commonly regard tears as a sign of sadness but without reason They are the effects of every passion which con∣tracts our fibres fear anger and even joy excite them as well as sadness and pity  In fear as in sadness there is an uni∣versal tremor a constriction of the heart pallor of the countenance sinking of the muscles relaxation of the skin imbe∣cility  and stupor These similar effects are produced by the same mechanism  Hence lovers overpowered by their good fortune remain inactive during the night of their marriage and recover not their vigour till their astonishment is dis∣sipated  Hence extreme fear suspends tears and moderate grief abundantly excites them  Hence fear chills us stupifies our or∣gans and arrests our motion  When fear is extreme the nervous fluid being violently precipitated into the fibrillae which form the muscular fi∣bres destroys the equilibrium between the resistance of these fibres and its action interrupts the regularity of the or∣gans of motion and even at times disor∣ders all their functions  Hence that tremor and numbness which deprives us of the use of our limbs hence the reason why a ropedancer can∣not perform those feats at the heighth of thirty yards which he performs with ease at the heighth of fifteen feet why some persons walk without danger over the roofs of houses whilst asleep whereas they  would have fallen had they been awake and sensible of their danger  Hence the bird which with its warb∣ling chears the night in the spring season when it perceives the viper beneath at∣tentively watching to devour it an ex∣treme tremor seizes its feeble organs a languor deprives them of motion till at length it can no longer support itself but falls as if by enchantment into the open jaws of that deadly reptile  I have said that the effects of sadness on the body are similar to those of fear there is however this difference between them In fear we almost always perceive a palpitation of heart which is not per∣ceived in sadness This difference is wholly to be attributed to the greater or less interval which passes in these pas∣sions between the different impulses of the nervous fluid into our organs and to the greater or less impetuosity of these impulses  When fear is moderate the soul is suc∣cessively affected by the same sentiment at very short intervals and at every repro∣duction of this sentiment it impels into the nerves particularly into the plexus ner∣vosi  a fresh supply of fluid which pro∣duces a slight spasm the blood vessels are likewise successively obstructed by the ra∣mifications of the plexus which surround them and the circulation is at intervals interrupted When the spasm ceases the blood is violently impelled into the heart which then becomes overcharged where∣by the circulation is rendered irregular and the pulse feeble and intermitting Hence proceeds the cause of this tension at the region of the diaphragm and of this palpitation of the heart  In love the eyes glister the complexion is more lively we feel strong agitations in the organs of pleasure a heat in the region of the heart and an increase of vigour in the whole body  From the analogy between the effects of love and those of joy it is evident that in love the soul abundantly supplies the organs of motion and principally the  plexus ner∣vosi  with the nervous fluid and more es∣pecially the plexus with which the ar∣teries are interwoven for the heat which we then experience about the heart is produced by the arterial blood collected in this part by the slight contraction of the  ramifications of the plexus which invelope these vessels  The soul very singularly affects the or∣gans of pleasure in love it even appears that these organs are the principal scene of the effects of this passion  These parts have it is well known an intimate corre spondence with the  semilu∣nar plexus  one of the  plexus cardiaci  by means of the spermatic vessels the ner∣vous fluid is abundantly supplied thereto animates the  musculi erectores penis  pro∣duces strong agitations in these parts and gives the whole organ that tension that turgidness so necessary to the design of nature and to the pleasures of love  In friendship the soul affects the body in the same manner as in love the organs of pleasure however experience no parti∣cular emotion except this the state of the body is equal and its mechanism is the same  Hatred produces effects contrary to those of love When that passion is extreme at the sight of the object of our aversion we feel a sudden tremor of the whole body a weight on the diaphragm a stu∣por of all our organs and a tension of  the muscles of the face paleness covers the countenance and the eyes wander  These effects are analogous to those of fear and are produced by the same causes  Hence ugliness renders us impotent whilst beauty on the contrary inspires new vigour in the combats of love  In the compound passions the influence of the soul on the body is the same as in the simple This may also be affirmed of its mechanism Hence the effect of these passions is the sum of the particular effects of the different sentiments which unite and are confounded therein  But these passions must produce differ∣ent effects according to the relative force of these different sentiments  Hence in terror when fear predomi∣nates we experience all the effects of this passion that numbness which de∣prives us of the use of our senses that languor which brings us back to the state of infancy that stupor which disorders the action of our organs and sometimes prevails so far as to destroy it When it is moderate its impressions on the body are very slight nor can we distinguish them from those of the desire of selfpre∣servation  the soul at that time impels the fluid of the nerves into the organs of mo∣tion as in joy increases their vigour and augments their elasticity  Hence that force which is produced by the sight of danger the last efforts of a sensible and intelligent being who en∣deavours to defend life or assure his own happiness  Rage produces likewise different effects on the body according to the nature of the sentiment then reigning in the soul  In sentiments of hatred and sadness which are the most early in their effects on the body the soul forcibly impels the nervous fluid into the fibrillae of the mus∣cular fibres extremely dilates their tube contracts that of the fibres and renders them somewhat rigid Hence the dia∣meter of the vessels is diminished and the circulation so imperfect that the blood is not impelled to the arterial capillaries hence the pallor of countenance and stu∣por of the limbs The  plexus nervosi  are likewise violently contracted and parti∣cularly the diaphragmatic nerve hence that pressure at the region of the heart that weight which then so grievously af∣fects  the stomach and nearly destroys res∣piration  But these effects are not of a long con∣tinuance to the sentiments of sadness and of hatred presently succeeds a strong de∣sire of revenge which afterwards reigns singly in the soul the nervous fluid is then forcibly impelled into the muscu∣lar fibres whereby their diameter is greatly enlarged this influx likewise compresses the fluid of the fibrillae aug∣ments their elasticity and envigorates the muscles  By the same principle the nervous fluid produces in the vascular system an aptitude to the most powerful oscillation the blood is thereby impelled to the extremities of the cutaneous capillaries and into the or∣gans of motion which it renders suscep∣tible of vigorous action hence the im∣petuous motions of rage and the prodi∣gious force of phrenetics Such is the manner in which nature who has esta∣blished between individuals different de∣grees of power sometimes renders weak∣ness equal to strength by means of despair  This influx of the fluid of the nerves into the fibres produces in the  plexus nervosi especially in the ramifica∣tions wound round the trunks of the veins a small degree of rigidity these vessels are thereby somewhat obstructed and the return of the blood to the heart is attended with difficulty whilst it is carried from the centre to the circumfe∣rence with its usual freedom the vessels are thereby greatly distended at the sur∣face of the body whence springs that redness of countenance that fire of the eyes which ever accompany rage  As this influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion is instantaneous these organs are not affected with a de∣gree of tension equally violent or equally durable the ease and perfection of their motion is thereby necessarily destroyed hence the tremor of the whole body the hoarse loud and interrupted speech ever observed in anger  The passions which are founded on ha∣tred add force to the natural strength of Man but this additional vigour is only momentary and rage as the other violent passion having elevated Man for a few moments above himself reduces him to an equal degree in the opposite extreme  On one part weakening the fibres by vio∣lent distension and contraction it dimi∣nishes their primitive elasticity on the other exhausting by reiterated efforts that fluid which is the principle of vigour it affects the body with extreme weakness which destroys both the power and the will to make any future effort  I leave to the curious the examination of the effects of the soul on the body in the other passions the explanation is sim∣ple and easy by pursuing the principles here established  The passions produce very singular ef∣fects on the body and display themselves by some outward mark or other to the at∣tentive observer but they are no where so apparent as in the countenance In the passions the face is the living tablet where∣on every emotion of the soul is repre∣sented with equal energy and force  By removing the teguments of the face we observe it to be composed of a great number of small muscles which adjoin to and unite every part by their tendons These muscles form all the expressions of physiognomy and display every affection of the soul The repose of all the mus∣cles  expresses serenity of mind and their different motions its different passions  In the same passion the same muscles are always contracted and that in the same manner in every individual When the soul passes rapidly from one sentiment to another the features they form by their contraction are successively effaced but when the soul is habitually resigned to any one passion the features are constant and become the characteristics of the physiog∣nomy  Every part of the face contributes to the beauty of the whole but every part contributes not to its expression Beauty consists in harmony and regularity of parts physiognomy in their motion The nose though the most protuberant feature of the face contributes the least to physiog∣nomy it having very little motion For the same reason the ears the chin and the temples contribute less to physiognomy than to beauty On the contrary the lips the mouth the cheeks the eyelids and the eye brows conduce much to ex∣pression by the different appearances they assume But no part is more expressive than the eyes in these admirable organs  the soul principally appears in these it expresses the most tumultuous emotions and the most agreeable sentiments in these it expresses them in all their force in all their purity and displays by the most energetic lineaments the image of its secret agitations The cause of this phenomenon may without difficulty be discovered  As the eye is formed of many nerves or rather as it is only a large nerve ex∣panded and as it abounds with nervous fluid to this organ therefore the impres∣sions of the soul must be principally de∣termined It being likewise very conti∣guous to the brain and moreover dia∣phanous the power of the soul must be there less weak and more apparent hence it is evident that the passions will be re∣presented in this organ with the greatest energy  The power of the understanding over the body is exercised by the same mecha∣nism as that of sensibility that is ever by an impulse communicated to the ner∣vous fluid By determining a greater quantity of this fluid to the nervous fi∣bres it produces a greater degree of ten∣sion  thus it happens to all our muscles to the  plexus cardiaci  and especially to the  meninges  during meditation This increase of the organic elasticity of the fibres strengthens the oscillatory motion of the vessels and renders the circulation more rapid When meditation is deep in the extreme this tension of the fibres is ex∣treme likewise and the circulation be∣comes vehement the contraction of the nervous plexus enveloping the blood ves∣sels at that time arrests the arterial and venous blood whence arises that heat and those anxieties which ever accompany profound application  By impelling a greater quantity of fluid into the nervous fibres the soul renders them more sensible and prepares our or∣gans to contract at the slightest impression Such is the method imagination uses to strengthen our sensations  Hence arises that intolerable sensation which is produced by the touch of others with a view to excite titillation Hence is the cause of that tension of the organs of pleasure which arises from the sight or idea of lascivious objects and of those emissions which are experienced when the  influx of the nervous fluid into the  mus∣culi erectores penis  and the  vesiculoe seminales  is very rapid  This fluid when determined to the or∣gans of digestion and salival glands by contracting them excites the secretion of saliva and gastric lymph Such is the me∣thod by which the imagination from the sight of delicate meats occasions the same motion in the organ of digestion as when they are supplied with the aliments themselves  But if at any time the imagination im∣pel this fluid into the muscular fibres it at other times determines it to their fibrillae produces there a degree of rigidity which destroys the action of the muscles and dis∣orders the whole body  Hence those shiverings that imbecili∣ty which sometimes render us unable to consummate the work of love  The passions not only display themselves in the countenance not only dilate and contract the fibres but the arms the legs the head nay the whole body as∣sume different postures according to the different sentiments affecting us By ex∣citing the same sentiments actors and mi∣mics  communicate to us their port their gesture and their action  The influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres of the nerves and muscles or into their fibrilloe a small degree of tension rigidity or relaxation of these fibres or of these fibrilloe are therefore the true and sole causes of all the phenomena of the influence of the soul on the body  But for what reason does the soul im∣pel the nervous fluid into the muscular fi∣bres rather than into their fibrillae Why into one organ or muscle rather than into another Why in shame does the head incline forwards in sadness and in languor on either side Why in love do the organs of pleasure experience strong emotions exclusively of others Why does imagination excited by the ideas of exquisite meats affect the organs of di∣gestion rather than those of love By what means does the soul in the different passi∣ons impel the nervous fluid into any par∣ticular nerve any particular muscle or any particular organ exclusively whilst every part of the body partakes of nerves which are common to all whose fibres are ever exposed to the influence of this  fluid which incessantly pervades them These singular relations between particu∣lar faculties of the soul and certain organs of the body this surprising correspon∣dence  Another phenomenon equally surprising which has not been more attended to than those already men∣tioned is the faculty which the soul possesses unin∣structed by experience of discerning whence it receives its sensations  which has been so little attended to is to me an enigma an incomprehen∣sible mystery which I relinquish entirely to any one who is willing to undertake the solution of it if it can be accomplished by the human mind  Let us here conclude with some impor∣tant observations on the influence of the soul on the body  Every different emotion of the soul af∣fects the  plexus nervosi  which appear to be the principal organ wherein the passi∣ons exercise their power There we feel that inexpressible anguish which pity ex∣cites in the heart when we hear the groans of the unfortunate or the cries of the op∣pressed there fear and terror intrude their terrible anxieties there joy introduces its  sweet transports and there the soul leaves its most durable impressions  The nervous fluid impelled by the soul is preci∣pitated in great quantity into their narrow and delicate tubes distends them and sometimes ruptures their coats which are too weak to surmount its resistance    All the passions domineer in the soul but the body particularly the  plexus ner∣vosi  is the wretched theatre of their conflict  Sentiment is only a transient emotion of the soul which endures only whilst the understanding is fixed on the object by which it was produced sentiment when produced is sometimes so early extinguish∣ed that it escapes attention  The soul possesses the power of fixing our sentiments at pleasure it sometimes pre∣serves them in opposition to the will When a passion is agreeable to us we en∣tertain its object exclusively and the soul is delighted in its contemplation let us then be ever so willing to attend to other objects pleasure constantly attaches us to this only the love of happiness ever pre∣sent to the mind always determines it to that which administers delight  Thus the unhappy lover separated from his mistress looks languishingly around him and incessantly engrossed by the be∣loved object takes no interest in others sweetly melancholy he seeks silence and solitude where without interruption and free from importunate cares he indulges his delightful revery and resigns himself wholly to the contemplation of the object he loves  The will and the love of pleasure can fix any particular sentiment in the soul but when they fix none therein when the mind chooses to lose sight of importunate objects and begins to neglect them it is the physical cause which detains us with that upon which we are then engaged It is the sense of the impression produced on our organs and principally on the plexus nervosi which recalls us thereto It is this which amidst sports and entertain∣ments calls back the unfortunate to their grief and tears  It is therefore only by aid of the im∣pressions produced on these  plexus  that th  transient emotions of the soul become permanent that they acquire any duration in our hearts after their causes have ceased  that they consume us and continually prey on the mind even in despite of ourselves  It is likewise by aid of the different impressions of sentiments on the body that contrary passions appear to be coex∣istent in the soul  Let us however observe that as these impressions are produced in contrary pas∣sions by opposite causes they are common∣ly destroyed one by another when of the series of different sentiments to which the soul is resigned the last becomes the most powerful but how strong or how feeble soever these impressions may be they mutually weaken each other Hence we never observe at one time on the phy∣siognomy the violent transports of joy and the destructive languor of despair al∣though we frequently discover sadness veil∣ed with a gentle smile  SECTION II  Influence of the  BODY  on the  SOUL  SEnsibility desires passions remem∣brance recollection wit talents of every kind even the most inferior qualities of the soul are different in every individual  Are souls then in their nature different Are there as many species of souls as there are of moss  Pope's Essay on Man  or are they the same and unvaried in all men This mysterious truth is equally unknown to the learned and un∣learned It is a secret impenetrable to Man and known only to the great Author of Nature But as we are able to account for the diversity of souls by the difference of bodies to which they are united and by the different circumstances of individuals the possibility even the facility of a phy∣sical explanation of the diversity of cha∣racters passions minds induces us to believe that souls are not essentially dif∣ferent from each other But were souls different in their nature their diversity would be of no effect so long as they con∣tinue united to the body when once en∣tered therein they instantly become sub∣ject to physical laws and receive their character from organization  Character is to the soul what physiognomy is to the countenance it is what distinguishes one soul from another  Let us examine in what manner the body cha∣racterises the soul and to what the varie∣ties  observed between men are to be im∣puted  Authors who have hitherto treated this subject not considering the dignity of their undertaking have instead of investi∣gating the laws of the influence of the body on the soul employed their imagi∣nation in the invention of new ones in∣stead of labouring to discover the causes of phenomena by their effects have con∣founded the whole by attributing to the body the properties of the soul they have made the faculties of the thinking substance so many corporeal faculties which they have distributed to particular organs viz  the nervous fluid  and  the fibres of the brain  by the motion of these fibres by the mo∣dification of these organs and of this fluid they have accounted for ideas  See Bonnet's Palingenesie Haller's Physiology c  prejudi∣ces desires passions † intrepidity cou∣rage memory and thought  By attributing to the brain functions so sublime by regarding this viscus as the organ allotted for the production of ideas as formed to represent the series of intel∣lectual  See Le Cat's Treatise in the Sensations Buffon's Natural History c  operations by a serics of particular fibres and sibrillae differently modified these sages have supposed in opposition to facts  Although we cannot perceive the cavity of the fibres which form the substance of the brain its struc∣ture and its use are however very well known It is undoubtedly a compound of many extremely small ves∣sels whose direction is visible allotted for the secretion of the nervous fluid from the blood This supposed marvellous structure of the brain can serve no pur∣pose if we restore to the soul those qualities which are without reason attributed to that organ  a particular construction which it has not an admirable structure su∣perior to all we can conceive or imagine where the Deity can read as in a book the different thoughts of Man Some have even strained the marvellous or rather the ridiculous † to measure the volume of the medullary substance and to determine the number of ideas which a grain of the me∣dulla contains Having made the desires passions memory imagination c mere∣ly corporeal faculties having given to each of these organic fibres a marvellous structure they have tortured their minds to apply them to the different phenomena  Robert Hook in the Philosophical Transactions  but finding themselves unable to make any just application they have made one which is absurd and unintelligible by these forced and puerile explanations by oc∣cult causes not in the least satisfactory they have involved in darkness that which they desired to explain rendering themselves ridiculous in the opinion of men of ge∣nius and unintelligible to inferior capa∣cities  Every one hitherto has fallen into these errors and as if it were impossible to arrive at truth has neglected that which alone could conduct him thither But if amidst so many successless enquirers a few at∣tained to the discovery of some truths they knew not how to improve them they only guessed not demonstrated  Thus ignorant of every true princi∣ple they undertook to explain these phe∣nomena but not being able to complete their design abandoned it imputing their inability to the intricate nature of the subject So that hitherto no advan∣tage has been obtained from any obser∣vations made on the influence of the body on the soul towards forming a fixed and regular system Every thing as yet writ∣ten  on this subject is vague and absurd I shall therefore endeavour to dispel this darkness or rather attempt to reduce this science to its principles  CHAP I  Influence of  ORGANIZATION  on the  AF∣FECTIONS  EVERY mind is endued with the same faculties in this respect all are similar but these faculties are more or less exten∣sive more or less susceptible of improve∣ment and some have their peculiar propen∣sities but in these all minds vary This diversity is wholly produced by the body  The Sensibility of the  SOUL  ever Propor∣tionate to that of the  ORGANS  There is a constant relation between the sensibility of the soul and that of the body a determinate invariable relation  Is the body endued with great sensibili∣ty The soul is so likewise does it pos∣sess but little of it The soul ever pos∣sesses it in the same degree  The cause of this phenomenon is very simple  However sensible the soul may be in it∣self the measure of that sensibility is un∣discoverable by us and is in fact wholly obliterated even supposing the mind to have been preexistent to the body and that all its faculties were active before its union with matter for the soul being once united to corporeal organs there re∣mains not the least vestige of its former state every thing is forgotten When united  See Book II Art of the unfolding of the facul∣ties of the soul  the soul receives no sensations but by the body like a sheet of white paper whereon objects are represented after hav∣ing passed through different intervening mediums the soul receives its sensations by the organs of sense its sensations there∣fore are founded on impressions made on the body But as the sensibility of the soul is a purely passive faculty the different degrees of which are not known to us by any immediate method and as the sensa∣tions of the soul are all founded on those of the body the vivacity of the sensations of the soul therefore depends on that of the sensations of the body The sensibi∣lity of these two substances must be equal  Thus the degree of the sensibility of the soul depends on purely physical causes  See Book I Art the organs of sense considered with regard to their different degrees of sensibility    Why the Sensibility of the  SOUL  appears more powerful than the Sensibility of the  BODY  The sensibility of the soul is ever pro∣portionate to that of the body and the sensations are ever more strong at the in∣stant they are received from the object than when remitted from the memory  See Book II Art on the exercise of the memory  Hence it appears that the most powerful artificial pleasures the most lively paint∣ings of the imagination must necessarily be weaker than the impressions of the senses However when we compare the representations of fancy with those of na∣ture the brilliant paintings of love in the  Adonis  of  Marini  with the merely physi∣cal pleasures of that passion we are much more strongly affected by the former than by the latter  Whence arises this phenomenon It is not that the sensibility of the soul is more strong than that of our organs as might be inferred from these examples but that  the senses in their enjoyment being ever confined to their objects can neither add to nor take from them whilst the ima∣gination being free in the choice of its colours and its lineaments incessantly passes from object to object selecting that which is most brilliant and most en∣gaging and from thence forms its images as the bee its honey from the most delicious parts of flowers The lineaments which are dispersed in sensual enjoyments are col∣lected or rather concentrated in our ima∣ginary pleasures and acquire force from this concentration as the rays of light collected in the focus of a mirror  The paintings of imagination must therefore appear more powerful than the pleasures of the senses although they re∣ceive their whole force from the sensations of the body  Why  MAN  is more sensible to Pain than Pleasure  Painful sensations affect us incompara∣bly more strongly than the agreeable for violent pain destroys all sensations of plea∣sure but the most powerful sensation of pleasure cannot silence a strong sensation of pain  However surprising this phenomenon may appear it is not difficult to assign the cause of it  Notwithstanding we are ignorant of the mechanism of the sensations it is however certain that their force is ever propor∣tionate to the affection of the nervous fi∣bres of which their organs are formed In the agreeable sensations these fibres are slightly affected it may be said that objects of pleasure pass only gently over them whilst in painful sensations the same fibres are violently compressed are ever rendered extremely tense and often broken  Hence Man is less sensible to pleasure than pain hence more strongly affected by the representation of Tartarus than by that of Elysium hence the attraction of pleasure the pleasingness of hope always yield to the fear of torment and to the hor∣ror of despair  Why the Character of the  SOUL  is ever con∣gruous to the State of the  BODY  There is a constant relation between the disposition or humour of Man and the constitution of the corporeal organs  Is the body affected with disease The soul is sad Is the body in health The soul is gay Is the former in vigour The latter is vivacious Is that Ianguid This is so too  Sadness gaiety vivacity languor these dispositions these sentiments are experi∣enced by the soul often when it is ignorant of their subject ignorant even of their source Like two harmonic machines the soul constantly corresponds to the state of the body the same phenomenon is ob∣served at all times and in all places the light does not more regularly follow the revolutions of the sun than the soul the revolutions of the body  Let us explain this phenomenon  Although the sensations be not the cause of the passions and although no mecha∣nism whatever can produce in the heart a sentiment of sadness or of joy it is ne∣vertheless a law of nature that when some particular sensation is received some particular sentiment should arise in the soul that  See Book II Art origin of our sentiments  pleasure should excite joy and pain sadness  Pleasure and pain spring from three different sources  From external objects by the senses  From ideas by thought  From the internal parts of the body by the general organs of feeling  The agreeable and painful sensations which arise from the two first of these sources are momentary because the senses are not always affected nor is the under∣standing constantly in exercise but the soul constantly receives sensations from the third source if it be only that of the state of the body  Joy and sadness sentiments which have an immediate relation to agreeable and painful sensations must therefore prevail in the soul in proportion as the one or the other of these sensations results from the dispo∣sition of our organs  The impressions of pleasure and pain which we receive from the two first sources are the cause of those transient fits of ex∣ultation and sadness which we so fre∣quently experience whose subject is ever known those we receive from the last are the cause of that gaiety and sadness with which we are at all times more or less  affected frequently imperceptibly to our∣selves but much oftener without our knowing their principle these form the basis of the humour of Man  Whilst the body is in health whilst all the functions are perfectly performed and the fluids circulate with freedom and ease this motion of the fluids produces on the  plexus nervosi  which envelope the vessels an agreeable sensation a slight and vague emotion more easily selt than described this sensation passes into the soul by the nerves hence joy which springs from pleasure and incessantly accompanies it must necessary arise therein together with this agreeable sensation Thus gaiety and good humour are necessary attendants on health  On the contrary are the functions of the animal machine disordered Are our fluids too dense too acrid in too large or too small a quantity Is their circulation violent or difficult The disorder within produces in the soul a disagreeable sensa∣tion ever accompanied with sadness  When all the functions of the animal machine are easily performed Man is gay  when with difficulty he is melancholy and sad  When an easy or irregular performance of the functions is the natural state of the body we are gay or sad by constitution But as easy circulation results from the equilibrium between our fluids and solids as this equilibrium may be easily destroy∣ed in a machine so complex and so feeble as the human body incessantly exposed to shocks from external objects from the impulse of fluids penetrating it in every part often so pernicious in their nature and almost always with so little proportion to its delicacy it may be easily conceived that the state which produces gaiety must seldom exist but that which produces sadness very often  That voluptuous sensation which arises from the easy motion of the organs is likewise much more restrained than the disagreeable ensation which springs from a defect in their harmony The former va∣ries very little because one cause only pro∣duces it the latter on the contrary  When this equilibrium is destroyed and the fluids prevail the blood circulates with difficulty we then feel a kind of stupor and indeterminate pain like that which men of pleasure experience when exhausted by enjoyment When it is destroyed and the solids pre∣vail it forms that sense of agitation we call inquietude add to this every kind of pain accompanying the dis∣cases and infirmities attached to nature  is  of different kinds and each kind is dif∣ferently diversified Thus the gay cha∣racter is ever uniform whilst the melan∣choly humour has as many gradations as are found between the slightest and deep∣est melancholy  Although the voluptuous sensation pro∣duced by the perfect state of the functions of the body be single in its kind it has however its gradations As this equili∣brium between the solids and fluids is more or less perfect the agreeable sensa∣tion which results from it is more or less powerful and the gaiety of temper more or less apparent  The sensations therefore of pleasure or pain have their different degrees but these degrees approximate insensibly there is a point where these sensations are so greatly weakened that they are no lon∣ger distinct but become confounded one with the other This point depends on  that disposition of the body which con∣stitutes uniformity or rather serenity of temper an indecisive character and so much the more indecisive as these sensa∣tions are the more confounded  Finally as the mechanism of the body to which these sensations of pleasure or of pain which are the source of a me∣lancholy temper are to be imputed is changeable so the temper varies likewise Observe however that the agreeable sensa∣tion which depends on the perfect state of the machine can be easily destroyed whilst the disagreeable sensation which results from the primitive constitution of the solids is in the other extreme Thus it is not unfrequent that gaiety yields to sadness but a melancholy temper seldom gives way to mirth  Hitherto we have discoursed of the temper only let us examine that vivacity and that languor of the soul which ever accompany the vigor or languor of the body one of which wears so strong an appearance of gaiety and the other of sadness  We must consider the languor of the soul less as a weak degree of sadness al∣though  it has all the appearance of it than as a state of indetermination where∣in Man possesses not sufficient power to determine himself Objects ever remain the same they likewise act on our senses by the same mechanism but whilst the body is affected with a languor their im∣pression on our organs  See Book I Art the organs of sense considered with regard to their different degrees of sensibility  is much weaken∣ed by the deficiency of the organic elasticity of the fibres Thus weakened the sen∣sations communicate an impression too feeble  I shall hereafter demonstrate that the sensations and sentiments when reproduced are not more powerful  to excite any strong emotion in the soul  There is a surprising relation in Man as in every other animal between sensa∣tion sentiment and action External ob∣jects act upon the senses the senses mo∣dify their impression convey it to the soul and the soul consequently reacts on the body Thus in the animal oeconomy the action of external objects on the senses is ever succeeded by the reaction of the soul on our organs The one is the cause the other the effect this cause and this  effect are ever proportionate The ges∣ture of the body the tone of the voice the rapidity of the speech and every mecha∣nical motion by which the soul externally displays its emotions have necessarily a force proportionate to the vivacity of these emotions  In voluntary motion the same relation is observed  Man cannot see his own good without making some efforts to obtain it nor be exposed to any evil without attempting to avoid it and that ever with an ardor proportionate to the greatness of the good he seeks and of the evil he would avoid Thus when the vigor of the body decays the sentiments are destitute of vivacity  The first cause of the languor and vi∣vacity of the soul is in the organs which receive the impression of external objects the second in the soul which experiences this impression and reacts upon the or∣gans In the former case these impressi∣ons on the body have but little effect on the soul in the latter the emotions of the soul have but little effect on the body  The force of the sensations of the body and of the emotions of the soul is ever  absolutely necessary to the vivacity of the temper and character but these causes alone are not sufficient for the soul and the body are without any immediate com∣munication Thus however powerful the sensations of the body and the emo∣tions of the soul may be they are inef∣fectual when not propagated reciprocally from one of these substances to the other The nervous fluid being the medium of communication between these two sub∣stances it follows that the impulses transmitted by either are very much mo∣dified by the action of this fluid and their force is ever in proportion to the vi∣vacity of this action  Whilst the body is languid this action is feeble for the same causes which pro∣duce the vivacity of the impressions of objects continue it whilst it is propagated and the same causes which are neces∣sary to transmit to the soul the vivacity of the sensations of the body are so like∣wise to transmit to the body the vivacity of the emotions of the soul  Hence  Macrocephali  are more viva∣cious than others and  Microcephali  less so  Hence likewise extreme fatigue seems to extinguish in our hearts all sentiments and desires Hence after a considerable haemorrhage the emotions of the soul are  See Book I pag Art of the necessity of arterial blood to motion  without vivacity and when our strength is dissipated we feel only the gentle emo∣tions of an indecisive will hence rage and courage decrease with the blood When enquiring into the causes of vigour of body and of the force of sensations I proved that three causes contribute thereto  See Book I Art the organ of sense considered in regard to their different degrees of sensibility  the primitive elasticity of the fibres the large diameter of their cavity and a sufficient quantity of the nervous fluid These concur to produce that vi∣vacity of our desires and actions which forms the sprightly character whilst the lax texture of our fibres their small di∣ameter and a deficiency of the nervous fluid form the effeminate and indolent  Such are the causes of that analogy of that harmony which is ever observed be∣tween  the temper of the soul and the or∣ganization of the body or so to express myself between the state of the body and the state of the soul  Hitherto we have seen in what manner the body characterises the soul but the influence of the corporeal on the imma∣terial part in Man ends not  In what Manner the Disposition of the  BODY  varies the Prospect of  NATURE  The soul is ever in a disposition analo∣gous to that of our organs this I have already proved it has likewise been shewn  See Book II Art Some singular phenomena ex∣plained concerning the effect of the passions on the understanding  that there is a constant analogy between the impression of external objects and the internal disposition that those objects are pleasing and agreeable when the soul is affected with joy much less so when it is affected with grief conse∣quently the mechanism of the body chan∣ges the prospect of nature the reason of which has been already assigned  Organization renders the Temper constant  Although the temper be variable it ne∣vertheless is not equally subject to change in every individual We have seen how the state of the body forms its character but the heart has other fources of joy and sadness than these  If the soul experiences agreeable or painful sensations which arise from the state of the body it likewise experiences others which are independent of it these must change its natural state when they are contrary to those which are transmitted from the general organ of feeling and with so much the more force as they have greater vi∣vacity The soul united to a sensible and vigorous body must therefore be of a tem∣per the most inconsistent but more es∣pecially if it be not determined by the constitution of the body for at that time the sensations affecting it preserve all their energy and as if it had no character its temper varies with the impressions it receives  On the contrary vexations change not the temper of the gay such feel them  only as slight pains which ceasing the soul readmits the sweet impressions of pleasure  See Observations and Book III  and instantly reassumes its wonted gaiety  On the other hand pleasure makes very slight impressions on the sad constantly concentrated within themselves  Ibidem  they are sensible only to grief and never admit any strong impulse of joy  Thus by diffusing their colours over objects our sentiments acquire longer du∣ration joy contributes to perpetuate joy in the heart and sadness to perpetuate sadness  The mechanism of the body therefore in characterising the temper contributes likewise to fix it  Organization renders  MAN  volatile or thoughtful talkative or silent  If we observe the influence of the pas∣sions on the body we shall perceive that joy shews itself externally by precipitate  motions  See Book III Observat and  on the contrary sadness ren∣ders the limbs motionless and appears immoveably  Ibidem  fixed in the heart This latter recalls Man's thoughts within him∣self whilst the former continues to act outwardly thus organization by fixing the temper of the soul renders the gay volatile and unsettled the sad reserved and thoughtful  Organization renders  MAN  morose cruel communicative or benign  Sadness incessantly centers the mind within itself  He whose thoughts are wholly on himself and who separates his interest from that of others knows neither pity nor generosity  Thus that organization* which renders Man sad ren∣ders him likewise obdurate and cruel that which renders Man gay on the contrary  It is not my design to exclude the influence of moral causes on the character of men What I un∣dertake in this work is only to show how organization characterises the soul  renders him communicative benevolent and compassionate The disposition of the organs likewise produces these effects by another principle for to the sad ever centered within themselves by the senti∣ment of their own misfortunes nature ap∣pears covered with a gloom all their ideas are mournful and melancholy if they speak of happiness it is to complain of the want of it they seem never to have enjoyed any of the pleasures of life  The sight of the happy causes the me∣lancholy sufferer to feel the full weight of his miseries it increases his sufferings by irritating his sensibility and wounding his selflove Thus he is grieved at the sight of those pleasures he cannot enjoy and is envious of that felicity which flies from him and is possessed by others he would willingly see all beings groaning around and tormented with him as if the num∣ber of his sufferings were diminished by those which he inflicts upon others  This is a kind of consolation by which selflove beguiles our grief  he  takes delight in disturbing their pleasures poisoning their happiness and becomes cruel and malevolent  This is the cause why affliction hardens the heart and why misfortune generates cruelty    How different the joyful Man The soul ever engrossed by agreeable senti∣ments pleasing images flattering ideas is but seldom afflicted sadness has but little power over a mind so disposed ever ready to take all things in good part its afflic∣tion must be very severe if it be obliged to grieve Thus that disposition of the organs which produces gaiety gives at the same time an amiable character to the soul and likewise generates benevolence  The Man of a gay disposition being contented with his lot is unenvious of others and so far from desiring to render their lives unhappy he endeavours to pre∣vent their being so not from pity to them but from love to himself his heart over∣flowing with joy reluctantly supports whatever would afflict it and hastens to remove every painful impression which either prevents its amusements or inter∣rupts its natural gaiety  Organization renders  MAN  suspicious and mistrustful  I cannot quit a subject so extensive the simple disposition of the machine which characterises the temper charac∣terises the human heart in so many other respects that it seems to be inexhaustible  The sad are suspicious and mistrustful they imagine every person that approaches them ready to deceive in proportion as their grief is more acute their suspi∣ons are increased and nature is covered with a darker veil  Whence does this proceed We are not as is commonly done to account for it by saying that mistrust is natural to a deceitful mind and that no one can be suscipious who is incapable of deceiving This maxim is true with regard to men absolutely ignorant but not with regard to those who have been instructed by ex∣perience besides we have no proof that the sad are less just than the joyful on the contrary if we observe misanthropes souls gloomy by constitution we shall  find that plain dealing is one of their cha∣racteristic qualities we know with what liberty they indulge themselves in offen∣sive expressions and how little trouble it gives them to speak the most disagreeable truths  It is not in that so often repeated max∣im but in the state of the body that we must look for the cause of this phenomenon External objects ever take their colour∣ings from the sentiments which the soul at that time experiences and it has been demonstrated that the prospect of nature is in the mind only now that particular organic disposition which produces a me∣lancholy temper occasions likewise loss of vigor Weakness and pain generate sadness and timidity and from these two dispositions of the soul united naturally result mistrust and suspicion for the fee∣ble being more obnoxious to danger than the strong more assiduously seek to avoid it are more provident and better prepar∣ed against snares obstacles and every kind of evil On the other hand the sad collect in their minds every difficulty exaggerate subjects of fear easily despair  and believe every thing to be gloomy a∣round them  Besides the pensive character of the sad and the natural succession of their ideas incessantly exciting in the mind thoughts analogous to the sentiment of sadness then present creates obstacles objections sub∣jects of fear and terror  Organization characterises the  AFFEC∣TIONS  There is a constant determinate relation between the organization and the affections of the heart  In the languor of disease the prospect of Nature excites no emotion the amo∣rous chant of birds the cool refreshing breeze the enamel of flowers no longer transport the soul insusceptible of joy the image of pleasure charms it no more At that time therefore we are feebly de∣termined to action  See Book IV Art Why the character of the soul is ever congruous to the state of the body  and if roused there∣to  are unable to continue we sink under it and sigh for repose But when the fibres are sensible elastic and abundant∣ly supplied with the nervous fluid the smallest objects make strong impressions on the organs and forcibly affect the soul The soul at such time can react on the body with equal vivacity and the repres∣sion of its emotions is as ungrateful as action in the preceding  The soul when united to a sensible and vi∣gorous body is therefore inactive and less patiently endures inaction than exercise but when united to organs composed of lax fibres it is indolent and effeminate  The soul united to gross organs loves lively amusements and noisy pleasures to delicate organs refined pleasures and peace∣able amusements  Brilliant colours are pleasing to robust persons such are passionately fond of warlike music penetrating odours and spirituous liquors Persons of delicate texture and great sensibility on the con∣trary  love light colours soft music and sweet odours In the pleasure of the mind the same diversity appears the deli∣cate and the sensible fly those noisy a∣musements in which the robust and vigo∣rous so greatly delight they love refin∣ed enjoyments the sweet effusions of the mind têtes à têtes and every plea∣sure which arises from the tender union of hearts  The cause of this phenomenon is on one hand the relation observed between the sensibility of our organs and the force of the impression of objects on the other the organic disposition which characterises the temper  With the impressions we receive from objects constantly concur two analogous sentiments of the soul love with a∣greeable sensations and hatred with painful  All men seek pleasure and fly from pain in this they all accord but we never seek objects but from the relation which they have to ourselves that is from  the degree of pleasure they can commu∣nicate  The sentiments of love and hatred must therefore change with these rela∣tions  A weak sight or rather an eye ex∣tremely sensible delights not in glar∣ing colours such being prejudicial to it A delicate ear delights not in vio∣lent noises for the same reason what∣ever is injurious to the senses is pleasing to no one On the other part every be∣ing loves to be sensible of its own exist∣ence Thus whenever any one avoids too violent sensations he seeks those on∣ly which have a certain degree of vi∣vacity  Hence the soul which is united to gross organs being too weakly affected by gen∣tle and delicate sensations loves those which are violent and strong such as spirituous liquors glaring colours the sound of the horn trumpet drums and all kinds of noisy amusements whilst the soul which is united to a delicate and sensible consti∣tution  delights only in gentle sensations tender colours expressive music in a word in every kind of refined and deli∣cate pleasure  But in these relations between the affec∣tions of the soul and organization there is a more than simple proportion between the force of the impression of objects and the delicacy of the senses for many mode∣rate pleasures are devoid of tenderness and a great number of amusements which can∣not be classed with the noisy excite no gentle emotion  What then determines the soul which is united to delicate organs to tenderness It is the constitution of the body but con∣sidered in another point of view  I have demonstrated that the state of the body which renders the temper gay likewise renders Man a lover of dissipa∣tion whilst that which renders it me∣lancholy renders him pensive But that disposition in which the functions of the organs are easily performed and is the medium between vigour and imbecility  affects the soul with an agreeable languor which pleasingly allures it back within it∣self such is the state of the body after the moderate loss  See Observation Book III  of spirits such is the last stage of convalescence when it just borders on perfect health and such is the habitual disposition of bodies which are delicate and sensible The gentle lan∣guor we then experience and which is a disposition to tenderness conveys to the soul an agreeable sensation with which we desire to be affected and which we che∣rish in the heart Hence we delight in every thing which tends to preserve it as affecting music amorous discourses and every pleasure productive of tenderness and love  But the affections of the soul are deter∣mined by the organization in a manner yet more particular  The prevailing passion in those affec∣tions of the soul which have a physical ob∣ject is ever fixed by that sense which is  the best constituted and by the most sen∣sible organ He whose organs of pleasure possess sensibility superior to that of his other senses is libertine and lascivious He whose palate or rather whose tongue is the most delicate of his organs is a drunkard or a glutton He whose hear∣ing is exquisite is passionately fond of music  I have said that the reigning passion is ever determined by that organ which is the most sensible this is evident since Man seeks pleasure with an ardour propor∣tionate to its vivacity But if of these enjoyments which he attains one part ex∣clude another he ever prefers that which is the most engaging The more sensible the organs the greater the pleasure for we can at all times proportion objects to the senses when too delicate but we can never proportion the organ to objects when it is deficient in sensibility  The gay love joy and seek comic or mirthful amusements the sad on the contrary delight only in those which are  sad and mournful they delight to re∣late and hear related tragic adventures shun gay company fly to deserts woods caves gloomy forests and savage na∣ture  It is easy to conceive why the gay de∣light in joy this being of itself agreea∣ble but by what caprice do the sad de∣light in sadness in tragic and mournful amusements If we attentively consider it we shall find the cause of this surpris∣ing phenomenon in the disposition which the soul receives from the body combin∣ed with selflove I have said that we seek after those things only which have some relation to ourselves this is true in more than one respect The sad by constitution being incessantly affected by a disagreeable sensation vexed that he is only conscious of his existence by his sufferings envious and jealous of what he does not possess and what if he were pos∣sessed of he could not enjoy hates those who are less unhappy than himself and by a natural consequence shuns all so∣ciety  where there is the least appearance of gaiety The idea that himself is not the only miserable being alleviates his torments the thought that others partici∣pate his sufferings gives him ease thus he recounts tragic adventures and is pleased at the sight of another's misfortunes As the only pleasure he can enjoy is that of afflicting the happy and as the only mean he possesses of relieving his own misery is the indulging himself in reflecting on the sufferings of others he flies to solitude to savage and desert nature where he may without interruption indulge the gloomy reflections of his soul Thus the physical sways the moral part in Man and the constitution of the body generates the af∣fections of the mind  I shall now prove that the force and duration of these affections depend whol∣ly on mechanical causes  The relations which are observed be∣tween the sensibility of the body and that of the soul are likewise observed between the state of our organs and the character of our sentiments  The force the vivacity the duration the violence of the sentiments of the soul are all of them effects of organization  The sensations are undoubtedly not the cause of the passions but sensibility is the measure of their force for the desire of being happy which blindly leads us in quest of pleasure and prompts us to fly from pain ever carries us thither with an ardour proportioned to the greatness of the good we pursue or of the evils we avoid  As the degree of the good and of the evil is ever determined by that of sensibi∣lity the passions must draw their force from the organization the sensibility of the soul being ever determined by that of the body  There is a surprising relation in Man between sentiment and action He cannot perceive his good without making some effort to acquire it nor be exposed to evil without attempting to avoid it This I have already observed but there is a ne∣cessity of repeating it here If it be evi∣dent as undoubtedly it is that Man ever  yields to sentiment and that the degree of the good and the evil is determined in every individual by that of sensibility it is plain that the more sensible Man is the greater efforts he will make to enjoy that good or avoid that evil  But this relation between sentiment and action is not restrained to voluntary mo∣tion the action of external objects on the soul is ever followed by the reaction of the soul on the body Unable to restrain the emotions agitating it within the soul displays them externally by impressions purely mechanical and ever with a force proportioned to that of its sentiments Thus in the violent passions we are ever transported with strong and precipitate motions but when all is placid and quiet within all is calm and serene without  Yet the man who is ardent in his de∣sires is not ever impetuous in his actions Vivacity of motion supposes only great organic elasticity of the fibres impetuo∣sity requires not only great organic elas∣ticity of the fibres but force and solidity of the organs likewise  The duration of a passion is determin∣ed by its objects The sensual are ever momentaneous those which have some natural want for their cause continue not after this want is supplied the others are not more durable But those which are produced by the imagination are incom∣parably more constant they reign through∣out the day and disappear not at night they attend us when we retire to rest and reign in the mind when all the senses are locked in sleep This duration of the artificial passions so long when compared to that of the sensual depends on the or∣ganization combined with the nature of their different objects  It is the property of our pleasures mu∣tually to destroy each other on enjoyment and to have no continuance without the assistance of novelty The objects of sen∣sual pleasures are extremely confined compared to those which are imaginary for the first are determined by nature whilst imagination ever active can in∣cessantly modify its objects and present them under new appearances Moreover in  the sensual passions the sentiments which then engage the mind are felt only by means of external objects when these objects cease to act the sentiment imme∣diately becomes extinct Thus in sensual love the sweet emotions of the soul and the spirits are lost together but in the artificial passions the heated imagina∣tion exaggerates objects adorns and em∣bellishes them the soul seized with an enthusiastic ardor affects the body with strong emotions and thereby retains its tender sentiments even when pleasure is extinct  Nature cannot long support the violence of an extremely active passion the sentiments forming this passion vanish and instantly reappear The cause of this phenome∣non is physical In every passion whilst the soul is fixed on its objects the  See Observation Book III  or∣gans are tense this is observed even du∣ring sleep when the commerce of the soul with the body appears to be interrup∣ted In the agitation of a troublesome  dream the pulse becomes quicker the complexion more lively the body is va∣riously agitated Man awakes and finds himself in his bed exhausted by fatigue and wet with sweat and with his tears In the passions tension of the body ever ac∣companies tension of the soul This ten∣sion of the sentient substance is not only determined by that of the organs of the body but wholly depends on it for when the body is affected with languor the soul receives no strong sensation it is insusceptible of it  See a preceding Article Why the character of the soul is ever congruous to the state of the body Book IV    Let us then conclude that if the soul cannot long sustain very strong emotions it is because the fibres of the body cannot endure great tension for any length of time  The violent passions consist in a se∣ries of sentiments which are interrupted one instant and renewed the next the succession of these sentiments is perceived only at intervals  The duration of each particular senti∣ment and that of their total successions depend on the organization For if the soul always requires the mediation of the body to receive any strong sensation if it be unable to fix itself without the con∣currence of the other it plainly appears that the duration of every strong emotion of the mind and that of all these emo∣tions which are successively experienced depends on that faculty of the body whereby it continues tense a longer or shorter time a faculty dependent on the different degrees of organic elasticity and solidity of the fibres  Thus the soul which is united to strong and elastic organs is subject to violent and durable passions that which is united to delicate organs unable to endure long continued tension passes incessantly from one impression to another and never ex∣periences any which is lasting  In the violent passions the soul is truly passionate only when engaged with its objects when it ceases to be affected thereby the passion expires yet the same  internal disposition continues even when the soul is engaged with a new sentiment The cause of this phenomenon has been already shewn to be in that impression  See the conclusion of the st Section Book IV  which sensibility produces on the body and which in its turn from an effect be∣comes a cause preserving in the soul the sentiment which produced it and recalling it there if at any time its object dis∣appear  But this impression which the passions produce on our organs is not equally dura∣ble in every individual The more strong these emotions are so much the more ap∣parent is this effect for the more strong is the impulse communicated to the ner∣vous fluid by the soul and the more ex∣treme the tension of the fibres so much the more is their elasticity weakened the equilibrium between these two powers of the circulation destroyed and the circu∣lation itself obstructed At this time the nervous fluid produces especially in the plexus nervosi a very great constriction  proper to continue the emotions of the soul  The duration of this impression is at first therfore in a direct ratio of the de∣gree of sensibility afterwards in an inverse for the more elastic the fibres are so much the more they yield to the action of the nervous fluid the more forcible like∣wise is their reaction and the equilibrium much sooner reestablished In estimating these relations we find the duration of this impression to gain less by an excess of sensibility in the organs than it is preju∣diced by an excess of organic elasticity  In a body delicate and vigorous the soul must therefore be subject to passions the most violent and the least durable in a body indelicate and robust to those which are the most constant  Hence the reason why men of great sen∣sibility are easily provoked to anger whilst the indelicate and robust are with diffi∣culty inflamed Hence the reason why the anger of the former is like a fire of stubble which blazes and is soon extin∣guished while that of the others is of  long continuance once excited to fury their souls cannot be appeased resentment remains after revenge is gone like the agitated ocean which subsides not to a calm till a considerable space after the storm But the duration of the passions is produced by many other causes Whilst Man is intent upon the object of his pas∣sion as he is ever surrounded with beings adapted to distract him he easily loses sight of it this very frequently happens During these moments of distraction if the sensation which occasioned it be not very interesting the passion must be re∣garded as a latent fire which instantly blazes forth on the least admission of air  If the soul be strongly affected by these new objects the passion revives not but yields to some other sentiment Thus the more sensible a man is the more he is exposed to the impression of external ob∣jects and the more easily will his passions be extinguished  This is the cause why the virtue of the sprightly is neither regular nor constant  it appears only at intervals by starts as if it had no source in the persons them∣selves they being obliged to be frequently recalled to the practice of it while the virtue of the sedate and robust has the ap∣pearance of constant habit  On the other hand while the passion is extremely violent and any sentiment ty∣rannizes in the soul other objects have not power to disengage the attention  The passions therefore if they are on one side less constant in proportion as Man is more sensible they are on the other more constant in proportion as he possesses greater sensibility  This is observed more especially in the passions which have a sentiment of love for their basis when the soul believes that its own happiness depends on the possession of some object nothing can disengage it from thence the powerful attractives of pleasure keep it intent on the be∣loved object and admits of no inter∣ruption  From these observations let us conclude that  A Man of extreme sensibility who has only slight affections must be the most fickle of human kind he is never so con∣stant as when violently excited by some passion  The force of the passions therefore depends on the sensibility of the fibres their violence on their extreme sensibility and their impe∣tuousity on their sensibility combined with their force the duration of the passions depends equally on the sensibility and elasticity of the fibres and on their force and solidity  It is thus the physical part in Man gives cha∣racter to our sentiments and passions  How Organization renders  MAN  openhearted or a Dissembler  To the preceding truths I add another which arises immediately from them  The same organic elasticity which causes the extreme force of the passions renders Man frank and openhearted for the soul cannot conceal its emotions they rush out precipitately and appear in his gesture speech and voice finally the repressing of these emotions is ever painful  and even impossible when the soul is strongly affected Reserve is peculiar to souls united to organs of lax or very gross fibres frankness to souls united to or∣gans of extreme organic elasticity  Men of great sensibility and liveliness always speak the language which springs from the heart the language of truth thus it is by warming the heart of him who is naturally cold that is by aug∣menting his sensibility by increasing the elasticity of his fibres that wine banishes reserve and lays open the heart  Thus no credit is to be given to persons of known dissimulation and habitual re∣serve unless in the paroxysms of passion Then only are their words without dis∣guise in these moments the violence of the emotions of the soul augments the tension of the fibres affects them with a slight rigidity frees them from the em∣pire of the will  See observations Book III  makes them drop the mask and appear without disguise  When you press the chaste mistress of your heart to lay open her mind to you  although she submits with regret to the lessons of her mother and to the severe laws of modesty she nevertheless divulges not her true sentiments she allows she has a friendship for you and nothing more But when wearied out with a long and painful resistance the dissembling fair permits her lover to triumph while love fires her veins while she embraces her beloved with transports clasps him in her arms presses him to her eager bosom and her humid lips attract and distil pleasure her voice is broken and faultering scarce∣ly can she articulate a few wordsex∣pressions of tenderness and love  Observations on the Manner in which Orga∣ganization renders  MAN  obdurate and cruel compassionate and humane  Let us again examine the effects of the primitive and organic elasticity of the fi∣bres for what a diversity in the moral character is produced by the different de∣grees of these corporeal faculties What surprising phenomena of which they are the cause Principles the most fertile  Principles whose extent when fully known demonstrate them to be almost inexhaustible  We do not compassionate the miserable but from an idea of his sufferings we have no idea of pain till we have experienced it ourselves if therefore to bemoan others we must have suffered ourselves sensibili∣ty is a disposition absolutely necessary to pity  If united to gross organs or to fibres too solid or too lax the soul becomes obdu∣rate and inflexible when united to or∣gans delicate elastic and vigorous it be∣comes compassionate and tender Hence pity although an artificial sentiment is nevertheless in every individual modified by the organization  The greater the sensibility of Man he may thence be the more humane and by a very singular consequence he may thence be the more cruel For if to bemaon others we must be sensible ourselves it is equally true that we discover only that sen∣sibility for others which we want not our∣selves The more sensible any one is the more assiduous is he to avoid pain the  more eager after pleasure the more en∣grossed by himself and the less concerned for others If in these cases sensibility be fixed on the sensual or artificial passions which have neither generosity clemency nor goodness for their object the voice of pleasure drowns that of pity the heart is contracted and shrunk within itself the soul full of the object of its desires denies its attention to every thing besides and is no long either clement or humane If the wellbeing of others be inconsistent with our own these affections become more extreme for if it be a consequence of the love of ourselves to love those things which are beneficial so likewise it must be to hate those which are prejudicial to us Thus they whom we now look upon with indifference become the object of our most extreme hatred when we regard them as enemies in the heat of passion we treat them with the greatest virulence relentlessly seek their ruin aggravate their misery and view their sufferings with an eye of satisfaction  The more sensible likewise Man is the more fearful he is of pain and the  more timid the fear of his enemy prompts him to complete his destruction when∣ever opportunity offers Let us therefore conclude that the more sensible a Man is the more he is obnoxious to hatred his cruelty is greater and the more atrocious his character  Another reason which modifies pity in our hearts is drawn from that disposition of the body which characterises the tem∣per of the mind  I have shewn that the melancholy hu∣mour by centering Man's thoughts in himself renders him unsociable obdurate and cruel  That which constitutes good humour is much more favourable to pity yet in some particular instances less so In the gay the sentiment of pleasure ever pre∣dominant in the soul nourishes therein ideas of joy and the sight of the unhap∣py generates those of sadness These therefore are weakened by the former and consequently make not their full im∣pression  The disposition of the body which constitutes serenity of temper is much  more favourable as it leaves Man the en∣tire liberty of his mental faculties and changes not the impression of objects  But of all dispositions of the body that is the most favourable which constitutes the tender character that disposition of the soul which determines it to compassion  The Man who is constitutionally sad may be just and sincere the gay may be equitable and meek and a Man of a se∣rene temper may possess the virtues of both But it is only to the Man of a delicate constitution of body that Nature has given a compassionate heart on him only has she bestowed that noble propensity to clemency that generosity of soul which takes pleasure in mingling tears with the afflicted in melting at another's woe and relieving the oppressed  Let us add that it is the same disposi∣tion of body which generates in our hearts that goodness which prevents the requests of others and that easy communicability of heart which in a moment contracts the most durable friendships produces that sensibility and tendency of mind  whose first emotions determine our lot and decide the destiny of our lives  Organization characterises the Manners  I constantly return to the sensibility of our organs so fertile is this principle so many and so marvellous are its pheno∣mena  The love of happiness is the great and only principle of all our actions but sen∣sibility is the source or rather the stan∣dard of our vices and of our virtues  Men of the greatest sensibility may be the most cruel the most vicious but to them likewise has Nature given souls of the greatest virtue of the noblest senti∣ments grandeur and magnanimity  Men of a little sensibility are beings without virtue lifeless carcasses wherein you can discover neither fire nor activity  Farther Observations on the Manner in which Organization renders  MAN  frank and hasty or timid and deceitful  The sensations which the soul receives from the general organ of feeling are not confined to agreeable and painful impres∣sions the soul likewise perceives the vi∣gour or languor of the body and this sense of vigour and languor greatly di∣versifies the moral character of Man  The sense of vigour  The causes which constitute the sensibility of our organs are the same with those which constitute vigour of body but besides these common causes sensibility has others which are peculiar to it as I shall hereafter demonstrate in treating of the influence of climates on the moral character it is this which ob∣liges me here to distinguish these two faculties  combined with sensibility renders Man ardent in his de∣sires precipitate in his designs and im∣petuous in his actions whilst that of lan∣guor renders him weak in his desires slow in his resolutions and indolent in his conduct  Those who are vigorous and of great sensibility are therefore furious vindic∣tive audacious and inconsiderate  Those who are weak and of little sensi∣bility are timid crafty indolent and pa∣tient  Organization determines the Force of the  SOUL  It has been already observed that a de∣licate body contains not a mind endued with force  In treating of the force of the soul I have destroyed the sophistry which has been used in the application of this term I have proved that properly speaking there are no minds endowed with force since every Man is irresistibly subject to sensibility and held in subjection by the passions I have shewn likewise that in every individual the force of the pas∣sions is ever in proportion to sensibility and that the sensibility of the soul is ever determined by that of the body Fi∣nally I have demonstrated that the force of the soul if we chuse to make use of  that expression is in an inverse ratio of the sentient faculty  The  soul therefore is  more in subjection in a body of delicate and great sensibility than in a body which is indelicate and robust  CHAP II  Influence of  ORGANIZATION  on the Mind  WHAT an astonishing variety of minds How different their cha∣racters  All men compare and combine their sensations to a certain degree but every one is not equally capable of comparing and generalizing them and of forming therefrom ideas and new combinations All have not the gift of invention nay not even that of perfecting what is alrea∣dy invented How few are able to think of themselves How many others yet more confined who cannot think at all but are ever chained down to imitation  never doing any thing but what they have seen done before nor saying any thing but what they have heard said as if endowed with instinct only and entirely destitute of judgment  In distinguishing the operations of the mind relatively to their objects we find that the greatest part of mankind are con∣sined to the combination of sensations and that but very few can attain to that of ideas but amongst the small number of those who think what diversity appears  There are some whose activity of soul is such that they can never seize any principle without tracing it to its most distant consequences There are others and of these the number is very great whose less active souls let every conse∣quence escape them which has not a cer∣tain degree of evidence at first sight and seize those only which present themselves  How different likewise their character In one judgment is the chief power of the mind in another imagination this is fertile in ideas that other has solidity of judgment this is more impetuous supe∣rior in argument that reasons more  closely and is more concise this excites admiration by his lively fallies that by the force and solidity of his eloquence silences guides and governs us  The cause of this diversity of minds has been ineffectually sought but if any one sufficiently attends he will discover this as well as the character of the heart to proceed from the disposition of the corporeal organs  The impetuous  Eschylus  the agreeable  Horace  the sublime  Milton  the judicious  Bacon  the profound  Newton  the saga∣cious  Montesquieu  in a word every man owes the turn and character of his mind to the constitution of his body  But not to rest content with merely as∣serting this truth I proceed to demon∣strate it to determine the dispositions of our organs which occasion the diversity of mind and develope the unknown laws of their mysterious influence In order to account for those phenomena I shall not follow the tract of those who have at∣tempted it before me nor will I have recourse to forced explanations which are neither convincing nor satisfactory while  the natural proofs arise spontaneously and lead us as it were by the hand to the scope of our pursuit Here shall be no enquiry concerning the complicated and wonderful structure of the brain nor the obscure and chimerical modifications of fibres and fibrillae which are exceed∣ingly magnified by some authors These phenomena are produced by the most ad∣mirable laws by causes so simple and so evident that it is really astonishing no one should have discovered them till now  Organization determines the Capacity of the  MIND  There are some men whose active souls receive few sensations without comparing them these are the most ingenious  There are others who compare only a certain kind of sensations these are less ingenious than the former and so much the less so as their souls have a less pro∣pensity to compare their sensations and to form ideas therefrom The souls of others again are so little active and so greatly averse to thinking that they neither com∣pare  nor combine any thing at first sight they require sensations which are both strong and many times repeated before they are brought to compare them and to form any idea such being more or less stupid differ not from the weak minds but in the small number of their ideas which they so laboriously produce  No man desires to know but because he desires to be happy he who is without desires and without fears will certainly not give himself the trouble of comparing his sensations of combining his ideas and reasoning therefrom  Passion therefore is the cause of this activity of soul this perpetual fermenta∣tion of reason  The curiosity of children and those decisive propensities which many suppose natural and which some philosophers pretend to deduce from in∣stinct have no other source This curiosity arises from their having been taught to look upon science as happiness and consequently that it was greatly their interest to acquire knowledge These propensities arise from the pleasure men find in particular employ∣ments  without it the mind unaffected unsupported falls into a lan∣guor and is immersed in sloth  The mind therefore  thinks  only when it has an  interest  in  thinking  this interest may be of many kinds one finds it in the pleasure which he receives from the knowledge of things another in the plea∣sure he takes in displaying his learning and attracting regard a third in the means of procuring the conveniences of life by his knowledge But whatever the object may be the passions ever ac∣tuate the mind by their activity its fa∣culties unfold and rise to perfection To arrive at excellence of any kind Man must be animated by some passion and the more violent his eagerness to succeed the more efficacious are his efforts for that purpose For only the violent passions produce illustrious heroic and great men he who is animated by no passion does nothing to render himself illustrious and is wholly insignificant  Men therefore are more or less ingenious as they possess greater or less sensibility  The human understanding is undoubt∣edly greatly indebted to the passions but if the passions are necessary to render the mind active they are not sufficient to pro∣duce  a creative imagination or a great genius they can indeed render Man eager after success but they supply not the qualities which are necessary to the ac∣quisition of it Some physical dispositions therefore are required together with the sensibility of our organs  Let us inquire into the nature of these dispositions  At our birth none of the mental facul∣ties is unfolded none in exercise  See Book II Art Of the unfolding of our men∣tal faculties  not even instinct But whether the soul ex∣isted before its union with the body or whether it had any peculiar method of acquiring knowledge or not it is most certain that when once it has become subject to the laws of this union it no longer retains aught of its former state not even the remembrance of it  Every man possesses the power of judg∣ing but even although we suppose that every man possessed it alike the minds of individuals would not be less different for the understanding can never proceed  alone but requires the concurrence of the sensitive faculty or rather that of the sensations  Examine the productions of the human mind the most singular works of imagi∣nation even those which have the least analogy to nature all have for their sub∣ject sensible objects or relations of these objects Almost all our thoughts are cor∣poreal images and of the most abstract ideas there is none which is not fixed by the senses there is not throughout all nature a work of the pure intellect If we desired for instance to form any idea of the Deity or his attributes we should consider him under human relations at one time as a beneficent father at ano∣ther as a glorious King now as a be∣nevolent master then as an offended Judge  He who would rise to the first of Be∣ings and contemplate him in his essence without the aid of corporeal images per∣ceiving no relation between God and him∣self knows not how to form any notion of him and is lost in the sublimity of the idea Thus all religions are supported by  a gross worship which interposes mate∣rial objects between the supreme Being and Man One contemplates the Deity in his works another worships him under an imaginary resemblance for the heart as well as the mind is ever fixed by the intervention of the senses  Thus likewise when we form to our∣selves a notion of the soul we ever repre∣sent it as a thin shade or subtil matter in short as a corporeal being if we form any image of it at all  Whatsoever object we chuse the case is the same for let us employ our utmost efforts to form ideas wholly intellectual or to conceive pure spirituality the only consequence of the attempt is to involve the mind in greater darkness and confu∣sion  Every idea therefore is formed from the true or false relations of sensible objects whence the understanding never operates without the concurrence of the sensations in proportion as they are removed from their objects the ideas we would convey become unintelligible without their assistance our ideas either escape us or they are ne∣ver formed at all  Let us conclude from the preceding that the sensations are the basis of all our knowledge  What a variety of minds therefore must be produced by the different structure of the organs of the senses the only means whereby we can have communication with the various beings which surround us  Our knowledge is neither increased nor perfected but by the comparing our sensations The greater the number of sensations to be compared so much the more numerous are our ideas the more distinct these sensations so much the more clear are our conceptions and the more exact these comparisons the more perfect our knowledge must be On the contrary the smaller the number of our sensations the more confined is the sphere of mental activity and the less numerous our ideas not only from the privation of those ideas which are founded on the sensa∣tions of the sense we are without but from the privation of many others for it is evident that as all the parts of ha∣ture are connected the sensations of one sense often serve to discover the relations of the sensations of another sense  The number of our ideas must there∣fore be relative to the number and struc∣ture of these organs whence  Man must be less intelligent less ingenious in proportion as he possesses a smaller number of senses and as his senses are less exquisite  Although there is an intimate relation between the number of sensations and that of ideas this relation is not equal with regard to every sense one sense may be confined whilst another is less so  From a calculation of the number of the objects of the senses the organ of smelling appears to be the most confined and that of seeing the least so The eye is of all the bodily organs the most com∣prehensive and takes in the greatest num∣ber of objects forms dimensions co∣lours are all within its district the va∣rieties it perceives in each of these modi∣fications of matter infinitely surpass all those within the cognizance of the taste smelling hearing and feeling that is of sounds  I consider not the car as the organ of sounds the conventional signs of our thoughts and I look upon the eye in the same light For if Man deaf from his birth receives no advantage from conversation so the Man that is blind receives none from reading and if it be possible to supply the defect of hearing by the sight so it is likewise that of seeing by the ear every thing is therefore in this respect equal the difference between the number of their sensations continuing the same  savours odours and sensa∣tions  from the touch This is evident during sleep for the many sensations which are retraced in the mind during rest are so many images of visible objects The sight therefore contributes more to know∣ledge than any of our other senses  With regard to the nature of our sensa∣tions it is very evident that from the different structure of the senses in different individuals there must be a great diversi∣ty in their respective impressions  Every object must naturally produce on Man an agreeable or painful impression for every Man is a sensible being and eve∣ry sensible being must be susceptible of either pleasure or pain but it does not therefore follow that the same object should produce in every individual the same sensation their respective senses not  being of similar organization In what∣ever manner material objects affect the senses it is certain that the same objects affect them not equally in every individu∣al and consequently produce not in the soul the same impressions The lilly is not beautiful to every eye neither is the anana pleasant to every palate nor the song of the nightingale to every ear I shall not speak here of these diversities in the sensations of individuals as their cause is utterly unknown but shall attend to those which are more evident and better understood  The chief differences between the sen∣sations of different individuals consist in their delicacy in the greatness of their image and in the number of the objects composing the picture the two last spe∣cies of these differences are peculiar to the organ of sight the other is common to all the senses  The more delicate an organ is the bet∣ter it perceives those minute objects which escape organs which are less so The de∣licacy of the senses is often necessary to the acquisition of many sorts of know∣ledge  we are indebted for the discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter and other ce∣lestial bodies of the animalcula in liquors and of the minutiae of anatomy to those instruments which have been contrived to supply the imperfection of our senses These supplements have advanced our knowledge in many respects beyond the point to which it had arrived a few ages ago and have in our times conduced to the discovery of many great and impor∣tant truths But as a delicate organ is more susceptible of irritation and less distinctly receives strong sensations than another that is less so it loses on one side what it gains on another and sometimes more To what use would the faculty of seeing in the dark serve if the light of day be painful to the sight it is very evi∣dent that a person so circumstanced would lose by the exchange With an eye like∣wise which comprehends only a small prospect we can discover particular beau∣ties more distinctly than with an eye which takes in an extensive circuit but we see not so well the harmony of the  whole  It is because attention is weakened by being ap∣plied to many objects  A too comprehensive organ sees detached parts imperfectly an organ not sufficiently so discerns not their relations  By entering into an examination of the sensations which are employed in the se∣veral sciences we might determine what particular structure of the senses is best a∣dapted for each but in general organs moderately delicate adapted to compre∣hend a moderate number of objects and pos∣sessed of every faculty if I may be al∣lowed the expression in a mean propor∣tional degree are the most advantage∣ously constructed In cases where pene∣tration depends on the number and dis∣tinctness of the sensations and on the comparing the sensations together he whose senses are best constructed must therefore have the greatest natural quali∣fications  But we perceive not says a celebra∣ted philosopher  Buffon's Natural History Vol mo edit  that persons whose senses are dull sight imperfect hear∣ing  thick and smelling greatly if not wholly decayed have slower capacities than others  The observation is just if understood of civilized nations for how is it possible to perceive the advantage of a superior orga∣nization of the senses in society where Man can easily find means to supply the imper∣fection of his senses What defect is there of the organs for which art affords not some remedy The shortsighted are fur∣nished with telescopes which bring near the most distant objects the weaksighted are supplied with microscopes angiscopes and other glasses which make them distin∣guish minute objects which would other∣wise escape them To persons of dull hearing are given acoustic instruments for those in whom the sense of smelling is decayed or taste imperfect are prepared concentrated odours savours juices and quintessences Supplied with these sub∣stitutes is it strange that men whose senses are imperfect should become in this respect equal to those who have re∣ceived from nature the most perfect organs Take your observations from persons des∣stitute  of these resources of art and then determine  Nevertheless he replies Man is not the more ingenious for having exercised his ears and eyes  I shall prove hereafter in opposition to the vulgar opinion that our senses are not rendered more perfect by use but sup∣posing it to be true what would our phi∣losopher infer from his vague assertion against the advantage of well organized senses Without doubt Man may have exercised his eyes and ears yet not be more ingenious than another who has not he may even possibly be less so for the mere exercise of our senses can never in∣crease our knowledge they must have been also exercised on subjects which are not only important but relative to some science  Were a man to spend his whole life in examining grains of sand he would not be less ignorant although he might know their different configuration than when he first began but if instead of this unpro∣fitable and barren occupation he had pas∣sed the same length of time in examining  plants animalcula and in forming such observations upon natural history as have rendered  Malpighi Lewenhoeck  and  Mus∣chenbroek  so famous do you suppose he would have profited nothing by this exer∣cise Do you imagine that his knowledge would neither have been increased nor his understanding improved The least reflection would have discovered the futi∣lity of these objections However it was necessary to employ some time in the re∣futation of them as the celebrity of the objector may be of great weight to the generality of readers Let us conclude  that the better constituted the senses are the more ingenious  Man  is  caeteris paribus  Organization characterises the  MIND  Men not only differ one from another in the number of their ideas but likewise in the nature of their knowledge The difference of minds therefore depends not wholly on the multitude of its judgments but on the manner in which they are formed  Does a man judge without much reflec∣tion does he form his ideas upon relations which are apparent only He is then  su∣perficial  Does he form his ideas upon true relations He is a Man of  sound under∣standing  Does he misimprove these re∣lations He is in this case of an  erroneous understanding  Does he forge chimerical relations which have neither reality nor probability He is a  fool  Does he too negligently compare his sensations He is  weak  Does he exercise his judgment on∣ly upon refined ideas He is a  wit  Wit is a habit of discerning those relations which are not obvious to every Man good sense a habit of discerning those which are true but obvious to all genius which appears to possess the middle station be∣tween reason and imagination is a habit of discerning relations which are latent and difficult to be discovered  Does he exercise it on ideas difficult to be ac∣quired He is  profound  He who has received from Nature the most exquisite has no advantage over him who has received an inferior organization unless he cultivate his mind But if ani∣mated with the same passion they both  apply themselves to study their efforts will be attended with very different success Whilst the former without difficulty sur∣mounts the greatest obstacles advances with a rapid flight in his progress towards truth and easily penetrates the secrets of Nature the attempts of the latter will be vain he meets obstructions every mo∣ment and proceeds with tardy steps in the vast career of science  I have already assigned some physical causes of the difference of minds but many others far more important remain yet to be discovered  Organization assistant or an Hindrance to the unfolding of the  MENTAL FACUL∣TIES  It is unknown whether the soul when disunited from the body can perceive think or remember its sensations and ideas or not but it is certain that when once it is united to the body the unfolding of its faculties depends entirely on the state of the body with which it is yoked Let us endeavour to discover the latent reasons of this important truth  Without sensations there can be no ideas as has been already demonstrated but if all our ideas are founded on the sensations they likewise depend on the understanding by which they are formed The mind cannot form them in the same manner in every individual nor can it form them always in the same manner in the same person  When the impressions of objects are made on the organ and the sensations are received by the soul all the functions of the senses are discharged but not all the functions of the body  To judge of the relations of objects we must distinguish these objects with care examine and compare them under their different appearances this requires attention  Attention is the parent of all know∣ledge attention by applying the mind to the consideration of beings discovers to us their different properties attention by fixing it upon the different phenomena of Nature investigates its unknown laws and its secret relations which otherwise escape us attention produces from the  various combinations of our observations those sublime discoveries those admirable inventions those prodigies of science those productions of genius which have been in so many various ways beneficial to man∣kind Without attention every pheno∣menon in nature is lost to us in vain is the soul endued with such noble faculties in vain does the universe offer its vast and wonderful volume to our sight  Attention is strengthened by being con∣centrated it then suspends all the other faculties of the mind and seems to have intire possession of the soul On the con∣trary it is weakened by being divid∣ed when it has got half way in a geo∣metrical demonstration if any singular object affect our organs the mind is in∣stantly distracted suffers itself to be en∣grossed by this object and after it has wan∣dered a while endeavours in vain to re∣sume the thread of its former thoughts Thus every sensation foreign to the object present in the mind diverts and destroys the attention  To examine objects to reflect to me∣ditate the mind must be perfectly calm  no sensation no foreign sentiment must then affect the soul  The first thing therefore necessary to the free exercise of thought and to the unfolding of the intellectual faculties is that the soul be united to a body whose vital functions  See Book IV Art How organization renders Man fickle thoughtful volatile or taciturn  are performed with ease modera∣tion and regularity  that is that the powers which cause circulation have a de∣gree of organic elasticity proportionate to the volume and consistence of the fluids  But it is not enough that the soul be united to a body in perfect health and ex∣empt from disease for that the body may not distract the soul from the objects on which it is intent the sensation which results from the action of our organs must be imperceptible Thus  the disposition most favourable to the reflection is that state of the machine which constitutes serenity of temper  that which causes gaiety allures the mind towards outward objects  See Book IV the same Art  that which causes sadness attracts it within the one prevents it from examining ob∣jects  the other from combining their impressions both distract it and interrupt the series of its thoughts Besides with that disposition which constitutes sereni∣ty we can contemplate Nature with the greatest advantage and discern what she really is  It is only in retirement and when the passions are at rest that the soul can re∣sign itself to profound meditation it is only in those tranquil moments when the soul retires within itself and is wrapt in silence that we can meditate to ad∣vantage  They who have great sensibility enjoy least of this liberty of mind being con∣tinually exposed to be acted on by objects and being strongly affected by their slight∣est impressions they are almost always engaged by externals This extreme sen∣sibility I allow may be in some measure remedied by shunning every kind of noise avoiding the light of day and retiring to silence and solitude of the country or by taking advantage of the stillness of the night But these precautions are practica∣ble in certain cases only yet though eve∣ry  precaution should be used the sensible will still be more obnoxious to distraction for the delicate and sensible are subject to more wants more indispositions and con∣sequently to more frequent distractions than those who are robust and of strong constitutions Thus almost incessantly influenced by their various wants and as constantly engaged in the gratification of them as if unavoidably attached to pre∣sent objects they easily lose the remem∣brance of the past together with the power of considering and meditating on those objects which present themselves to the mind or rather they never possess it For during the perpetual flux of tumul∣tous sensations which incessantly attract the attention outwardly they can neither ex∣amine nor meditate upon any subject what∣ever  It is therefore extremely difficult if not impossible for a soul united to very deli∣cate organs to employ itself in profound meditation and to enjoy that liberty which is so necessary to the study of Nature  Reflection is a state of the mind which requires a sufficient degree of sensibility to be strongly affected but not enough to  make it be irresistibly attracted by pre∣sent objects  Only the Man whose soul is united to organs of moderate sensibility can meditate at liberty and study with success  Organization renders the Understanding ei∣ther just extensive delicate profound or superficial confined erroneous and gross  Our intellectual faculties are neither developed nor improved but in propor∣tion as the mind compares its sensations The more it compares them the more it discovers their relations and the more numerous are our ideas the more care∣fully it examines them so much the more perfect is our knowledge  I have distinguished two powers of the understanding that of perceiving and con∣sidering objects and that of pronouncing on their relations The first is the basis of the second and necessarily precedes it What then is requisite to enable the mind to form a sound judgment of things An accurate perception of them It is therefore on the greater or less degree of attention we employ in examining  objects or rather on the different apti∣tude of the mind for attention combined with the time it is able to support it that the justness of our judgments and the character of our ideas depend  To acquire profound ideas we must for a long time and without distraction contemplate the same objects consider their relations their difference examine compare and combine them in many dif∣ferent shapes that we may afterwards consider them under unobserved appear∣ances and discover their hidden relations  I will not however say that every great discovery has been made by gradual series of combinations and complicated observa∣tions Sometimes the mind overlooks the intermediate space and perceives its ob∣ject at a distance amidst surrounding darkness but if in this manner it arrive at truth it must nevertheless return to observation to experience and to this gradual series of combinations to verify these new ideas and connect them to o∣thers which have been already acquired Thus having at once traversed an immense space it is afterwards obliged to pass over  every intermediate degree which separates the two extremes returning circularly to the point from whence it at first set out Such is the progress of the human mind in discoveries of every sort  Thus a person desirous to acquire new knowledge or verify that which he has already acquired can never accomplish his design but by a long and close exami∣nation of the phenomena of nature  It is therefore only to attention more or less strong more or less continued  This attention is not the same with that which is required in studying the languages in this latter every thing is unconnected in the former every thing is connected in the one the mind relieves itself by employing attention but at intervals when prompt∣ed by the will and by passing from one object to ano∣ther but in the other the same subject requires conti∣nued attention the soul cannot examine and repose it∣self alternately He who desires to divide his time be∣tween the examination of objects and repose is ever at a stand in his observations is constantly distracted in his thoughts is perpetually obliged to recommence the same labour and never profits by his pains  that we owe the superficiality or profundity of ideas  This different aptitude of the mind for attention and the space of time it is able to support it absolutely depend on organiza∣tion for the mind becomes fatigued just as the body does and both at the same time  It is unknown whether the soul is re∣ally fatigued for our knowledge of things is not sufficient to demonstrate whether an immaterial substance is or is not naturally susceptible of lassitude but without the least doubt the soul when once it is unit∣ed to the body and during the whole con∣tinuance of its union therewith experi∣ences a sense of fatigue as frequently as the body  Might I have leave to offer my opinion upon so delicate a subject as this is I would declare for the negative and would support it thus  Since the sense of lassitude is common to both soul and body when united it is evident that the soul must become fa∣tigued together with the body  The lassitude of the mind is partly the lassitude of the body itself  Lassitude of body is only an unpleasing sensation which arises from the too frequent and too continued tension of the fibres by which the nervous fluid which distends them is exhausted their organic elasticity de∣creased a languor seizes the senses and the whole bo∣dy is affected with stupor  which is  communicated to it by the general organ of feeling and probably it is no more than this for since the mind to be in∣tent requires the fibres to be tense and as the fibres are ever fatigued by their ten∣sion it is not to be wondered at that the soul should cease to be intent when the fibres cease to be tense or which is the same the mind ever appears fatigued when the body is tired and the body is tired at all times when the mind is fatigued Be∣sides we have no idea of the lassitude of the soul but by the weakness of its thoughts and emotions and by their short continu∣ance on the same subject When the bo∣dy is tired that is when the organs are affected with languor the functions of the soul must needs be languid the ideas scarcely distinct and the vivacity of the sentiments decayed  See Book IV Art the character of the soul ever congruous to the state of the body  This has been al∣ready explained  It is therefore evident to me that the lassitude of the soul is only lassitude of the body  If our fatigue be somewhat diminished by a change of objects it is not because the soul then acts upon others fibres as a modern writer has supposed but that the soul roused by this new object experiences a fresh pleasure which partly conceals the prior sense of fatigue and likewise because this new object of∣ten requires a less degree of attention which dimi∣nution administers some sort of relaxation and repose But if this new object require greater attention so far from relieving the fatigue of the soul it very sen∣sibly augments it This we experience when we change the study of history for that of geometry or the superficial perusal of a romance for some deep pro∣blem in mathematics  and that in this phenomenon as in many others the reality is concealed by the appearance  But whether it be so or not this is cer∣tain that the mind is fatigued together with the body This is an observation which universally prevails yet no one has hitherto thought proper to deduce the na∣tural consequences from it  When the body is fatigued admitting that the soul really fatigues the body by application let us be ever so desirous to continue our meditation and make what∣ever  efforts we please we cannot long keep the mind fixed on the same object nor fix it there for any time strongly  The soul therefore cannot continue its attention when the fibres have lost their tension  It is therefore erroneous to suppose as many philosophers have done that our aptitude for attention solely depends on the power of the passions It is true that the greater interest we take in applying ourselves to any particular study the longer we can support attention passion can then employ the whole strength of the body but nothing more hence let the passion be ever so violent  attention is always proportionate to the elasticity and force of the fibres  Besides forced attention is more preju∣dicial than favourable to our study In the first place it cannot be very strong from the painful sensation which ever ac∣companies it its duration likewise is very short for when the organs are once wea∣ried they act but with little force be∣sides the body is exhausted by those vio∣lent efforts and Man loses by its disordered state all the time which he endeavours to  gain by this prolongation of attention and sometimes even more  Such are the physical causes of many diversities of mind causes which have hitherto been unnoticed by philosophers although they so naturally arise on exami∣ning the phenomena I have now under∣taken to explain And here let us repeat our first principle in order to a combina∣tion of its effects and that we may de∣duce its proper consequences  Attention is ever proportionate to the or∣ganic elasticity and force of the fibres  To pro∣duce profoundideas the mind therefore must be united to organs composed of fibres which are both strong and elastic the mind if united to inelastic and weak organs is trifling and supercifial in its operations Thus a Man whose constitution is deli∣cate and sensible is not capable of pro∣found disquisitions too weak to sustain long meditation and too sensible to lead a contemplative life he beholds Na∣ture without attending to particular parts incessantly flies from object to object glances upon them and dips not beneath the surface  However I do not pretend to say that every man of strong and vigorous consti∣tution is thus profound for besides this physical disposition his talents must be cultivated all I would be understood to say is that only a man of such a consti∣tution of bodily organs can arrive at this state others may indeed have a great number of just and solid ideas but never those which are profound and well con∣nected That sublime knowledge which is derived from the constant study of Na∣ture is what they are unable to acquire of themselves on the contrary they must be initiated in it by others their minds may be congenial with the minds of Pope and Voltaire but will never rise to the dignity of Newton's or de Montesquieu's they may be called men of wit and learning but never men of depth  To be just our ideas must be distinct but these qualities are not always united To conceive distinctly it is sufficient that our sensations be well expressed and that the mind be exact in pronouncing on their apparent relations but to conceive justly there is required a perfect knowledge of  every relation necessary to form a solid judgment Thus ideas may be distinct yet not be just  We may therefore from this cause rea∣son justly upon one article and falsely upon another but in every case where to dis∣cover the true relations of beings it is re∣quisite that we attentively examine them in every case where the knowledge of things is the result of a great number of complicated combinations in every case where truth is difficultly obtained and where there is a necessity of seeing much if we desire to see well the justness of our judgments depends on the capacity of the mind and on its profoundness or rather justness and profoundness require the same degree of attention of the soul and the same organic disposition of the body With feeble and delicate organs therefore Man is incapable of this justness of judg∣ment too weak to consider objects under their various appearances successively and too feeble to pursue the connexion of things and to collect a multiplicity of ideas in the same point he suffers many things to escape from an inability to retain them  and examines hastily those which remain thus passing slightly over many objects and judging of the whole by his imper∣fect knowledge of a part he forms de∣ductions necessarily false and inconclusive  Ideas are particular or general relatively to their object The same disposition of organs which is necessary to the acquisi∣tion of profound ideas is likewise ne∣cessary to the acquisition of those which are universal for the universality of ideas results from the multitude of relations which the understanding perceives unites and collects into one and the same point of view The faculty of comprehending the system of Nature is therefore given only to those whose fibres are endued with force and great organic elasticity  Another effect of this organization of the body which we could never have sus∣pected and scarcely believe although it is demonstrated is that it is absolutely ne∣cessary to delicacy of sensations and ideas  It is an opinion universally received by philosophers that the senses are perfected by use and that they are improved by seeing feeling tasting c just as the mind is improved by reasoning  A painter says one sees at first sight the defects of a drawing and the dif∣ferent tints in a picture although invisi∣ble to other eyes  A shepherd accustomed to number his flock knows them from those of another by marks which none but himself can discover  A man of a nice palate in liquors distinguishes in the flavours of wines dif∣ferences which are unnoticed by others  The ear of the musician who leads the orchestra is sensible of the least dissonance  And the words of a foreign language appear to one unaccustomed thereto but a confusion of articulate sounds which become afterwards distinct by hearing them frequently repeated  If we maturely consider these pheno∣mena we shall find this pretended im∣provement of the senses  The errors which philosophers have been guilty of relating to the organs of our sensations are really surprising one pretends that our senses continually de∣ceive us another that they are perfected by exercise a third that they possess not the least degree of cer∣tainty and that each organ requires to be rectified by some other phenomena which have been hitherto attri∣buted to the organs though they wholly belong to the understanding and are mere mental illusions  which is at∣tributed  to exercise to be very erroneous for exercise neither changes the texture of our organs nor adds to their delicacy It is true that by exercising the senses a greater quantity of nervous fluid is de∣termined into their organs whereby their sensibility is increased but he who en∣deavours to view minute objects for the first time has the organ of sight equally tense with him who is accustomed to dis∣tinguish them at the first glance although he can neither see nor remark any thing It is not therefore to the organ but to the soul which receives the sensation that we are to attribute the cause of this phe∣nomenon  This pretended delicacy of the senses arises only from the attention which the mind gives to the smallest impressions of objects affecting it for whether we ex∣ercise our organs or not the delicacy of the senses continues the same But the  mind being attentive to the sensations it receives gradually becomes able to dis∣cern the smallest differences which are too weak to be perceived by a single effort of the attention Besides it is not in the organs of sense that the soul perceives but in itself there the prospect of nature ex∣ists We must therefore look on sensibi∣lity as a tablet upon which are represented the images of the objects which affect us and wherein the understanding perceives them As these representations have parts of astronger or weaker colouring more or less luminous more or less distinct so some of these  See Book II Art Exercise of the Understanding  more strongly engage the mind than others those which are weak∣ly coloured and are the representations of very minute objects are almost im∣perceptible such are not perceived at first sight but must be sought for with atten∣tion before they are found If a painter perceive at the first glance the defects of a painting if a shepherd easily distinguish his sheep this proceeds from no other cause than that both are accustomed to  turn their attention to these objects more frequently than to any other Thus a very great number of delicate sensations re∣ceived by a soul united to strong and e∣lastic organs are lost when united to or∣gans destitute both of strength and vigour  What I have said of the sensations is true in regard to ideas likewise for it is only by long continued attention that we can make those delicate observa∣tions and acquire those refined ideas which escape the generality of men  Thus the difference of the force and elasticity of our fibres is a new source of the diversity of minds  Hitherto we have seen in what manner the corporeal influences the spiritual part how the constitution of the body forms the character of the mind but we have not yet concluded let us make further re∣searches into this subject and endeavour to discover truths hitherto enveloped with extreme darkness  The more we study the soul the more we trace its progress in the exercise of its faculties and the more we examine its operations the more shall be forced  to acknowledge the powerful influence of the corporeal on the intellectual part in Man  Organization renders  MAN  rational or insane  The mind undoubtedly possesses the fa∣culty of thinking and although all men were equally endowed therewith organi∣zation would not the less regulate the ex∣ercise of this faculty for thinking when our thoughts are in regular succession re∣quires tension of the fibres the mind ne∣ver can proceed alone but requires the concurrence of the organs to form a sound judgment of things or to reflect Thus depending on the senses for its unfolding on the organic elasticity and force of the fibres for the character of its ideas it likewise depends on the same organic elas∣ticity of these organs for the order of its thoughts and the mode of their succces∣sion this last dependency of the soul on the body is the cause of the principal di∣versities in minds  Regular thought ever requires a certain aegree of tension of the fibres the mind can  never proceed alone but needs the concur∣rence of our organs to form a sound judg∣ment of things or to reflect  This principle the importance whereof all who think justly must needs feel now first presents itself besides it is so closely connected with the subject that it re∣quires to be fully explained and to be es∣tablished on the most demonstrative proofs I therefore proceed to consider Nature in a manner never attempted before  The mind is endued with the faculty of judging but judges not always in the same manner at one time its thoughts are connected with each other at another they are without either continuance or connection sometimes they succeed each other with rapidity and sometimes the reverse  Philosophers have attributed these phe∣nomena to the soul never supposing what now appears a certain truth that they wholly depend on the body The mind judges not in any particular manner but by means of some particular relations be∣tween it and the disposition of our organs this disposition determines the character of our thoughts  Although ideas arise without our con∣sent and sometimes in opposition thereto the mind always requires the assistance of the body to dispose them in succession and determine them to some particular end  When the body is exhausted with fa∣tigue when the head inclines forward on the breast when the eyes are heavy and yield to the pleasing power of sleep the blood steals through the veins with a gentle current the sensations grow weak∣er by degrees the senses lose their viva∣city and the mind traces out faint images only resembling the almost imperceptible contours drawn by a very light hand  In sleep all our faculties are in action although the imagination appears to be the only acting power but the sensations fol∣low and the thoughts succeed each other with rapidity and confusion and we nei∣ther compare nor are conscious of them the mind at that time in appearance disengaged from matter rambles after dif∣ferent objects and from their irregular assemblage forms those empty images which compose our nocturnal illusions  On the contrary in inflammatory fevers when the blood rapidly circulates in the vessels the sensations and ideas are strong∣ly marked nevertheless they succeed each other in confusion whilst the soul neither compares nor is conscious of them But with persons both healthy and awake the sensations have a moderate degree of force the ideas are distinct the soul com∣pares them and disposes them in a regu∣lar and orderly succession  If we maturely consider these phenome∣na we shall discover their cause to consist in the different tone of the fibres whilst asleep or awake in a healthy or diseased state of the body In sleep this tone is too feeble to promote the justness of our thoughts and the regularity of their suc∣cession in an inflammatory fever the tone is on the contrary too strong a regular succession of thoughts therefore always requires a certain degree of tension or rather a moderate degree of organic elasticity  As these ideas are too singular these principles too new to be received without farther confirmation I shall proceed to  give the clearest evidence of their truth Man has two modes of existence sleeping and waking in this latter every spring of the machine is in action in the former those only which are allotted for the con∣tinuation of the vital functions  Sleep is essential to Man it is the ne∣cessary consequence of his constitution and of the laws of the animal oeconomy by these laws he passes from a sleeping to a waking state by these laws likewise the time of waking necessarily succeeds that of repose and both are independant of every external cause For Man can subsist for a determinate space only in either of these states by continual watching the inces∣sant motion of the fibres would destroy their organic elasticity and prevent their future reparation so by continual sleep∣ing though the fibres are not fatigued the nervous fluid would be gradually ex∣hausted by the action of the organs of life and would never be repaired  The continuance of either of these two modes of existence would therefore ne∣cessarily be attended with a total cessation of vital motion  At the approach of sleep the muscles relax the neck seems unable to support the head the arms yield to their own weight the senses become inactive the whole body sinks into repose and the blood circulates with a slow and gentle pace By attending to the disposition of the organs of a man asleep and to the pheno∣mena accompanying it we discover that this state is produced by the defect of the organical elasticity of the fibres This relaxation is even sensible to the touch the skin of one asleep being more moist and the fibres softer than when awake But were this relaxation imperceptible by the senses the simple examination of the causes of sleep will be sufficient to confirm the truth of the principle here established  It is an incontestible fact that every thing which impairs the organic elasticity of the fibres occasions sleep and that every thing which increases this elasticity prevents it The loss of nervous fluid in coition is immediately followed by a slight drowsiness after the conflicts of love the vivacity of our motions is diminished our desires are extinct and we gradually sink into repose  The loss of the same fluid by labour produces the same effect  Though this loss of the nervous fluid be a principal cause of sleep it is not the only one let us repair it ever so much by fresh supplies of aliments sleep will not be the less necessary this may prevent it for a short time but afterwards suffers it to return with new force Thus the loss of nervous fluid is not alone produc∣tive of it since not being exhausted of this fluid Man sleeps not the less sleep therefore is occasioned by a disposition pe∣culiar to the solids and this disposition is no other than the lassitude of the or∣gans produced by the tension of the fibres when awake or by the reiterated extension and contraction of the muscles in motion  Sleep therefore is caused by the diminu∣tion of the organic elasticity of the solids and by the diminution of their primitive elasticity for it is certain that an elastic body loses its primitive elasticity by fre∣quent contraction The fibres after ex∣treme tension relax and their organic elasticity being impaired the circulation  is slowly performed the secretion of the nervous fluid is obstructed as likewise its influx into the organs of sense and mo∣tion whence result a diminution of sen∣sibility a weakness and a general languor of the sensations desires and ideas  See a preceding Art the disposition of the soul is ever congruous to that of the body    Although all communication between the soul and the body appears interrupted during sleep these two substances however have a constant relation one to the other The senses are ever open to the action of external objects and their slightest im∣pressions are conveyed to the soul but too weak to engage it they only glance there∣on without leaving any vestige behind strong sensations only can awaken and en∣gage it These are phenomena peculiar to sleep and proper to confirm what has been already said concerning its causes  These truths however are supported by other phenomena The fibres of persons greatly disposed to sleep are feeble and it is by sleep that our existence commences The infant whose fibres are endued but  with a very small degree of organic elas∣ticity sleeps continually children whose fibres are very weak sleep more than they wake in proportion as they advance in years that is in proportion as their fibres acquire strength and elasticity they en∣dure more easily the want of repose wo∣men less strong and less vigorous than men have likewise more occasion for sleep Phlegmatic men  It is remarked that geldings are less vigorous than horses and likewise sleep more  whose fibres have but a small degree of organic elasti∣city consume the half of life in that state and people when recovering from any disease sleep almost continually  Another cause is that every thing which impairs the force of the circulation by decreasing the elasticity of the fibres as heat emollient liquors and whatever be∣numbs the solids as sulphureous vapours spirituous liquors and opium ever pro∣duces sleep  In subjects which have died of a le∣thargy or of any sleepy disease we find the head disordered and the other parts sound  Bonet  See the Sepuleretum Anatomicum  who has collected a vast number of observations of this kind  found a great quantity of extravasated serosities in the brain of one who had died of a lethargy so that the  cortical substance  and the  meninges  were covered therewith In another subject that had never been attacked but once with any sleepy affection the internal part of the  cerebrum  was full of extravasated serosities In others he found scir∣ruses and tumours in the  cortical  part of this  viscus  Finally in some that had been affected with an habitual le∣thargy the substance of the brain was found dry and the vessels of the  pia mater  extremely distended with thick and grumous blood  These observations prove that this con∣tinual numbness is caused by the diminu∣tion or even by the total suppression of the influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion and sense a natural effect of its vicious secretion during the distension of the cortical substance of the  brain of the defect of the oscillatory motion of the distended  meninges  of the compression of the medullary substance by the extravasated serosities or the defect of this fluid as in a siccity of the brain Be∣sides it is well known that the simple pressure of this  viscus  after the removal of the  cranium  produces sleep by pre∣venting the influx of the nervous fluid in∣to the origin of the nerves and conse∣quently by weakening the organic elasti∣city of the fibres as the preceding causes  I have many times experienced this after the ope∣ration of the Trepan the slight pressure on the brain ever produced an obscurity of sight and a noise in the ears a pressure somewhat more strong was followed by drowsiness and afterwards by perfect sleep all these symptoms ceased upon discontinuing the pressure  But the most conclusive reason is that sleep cannot take place whilst the body is violently agitated either by a fever or by any violent passion equally capable of producing a tension of the fibres  If the relaxation of the fibres be the cause of sleep the reestablishment of their organic elasticity by repose must be the cause of waking This cause which  is necessarily deduced from the nature of things I shall demonstrate by its pheno∣mena  On the conclusion of undisturbed sleep the fibres insensibly become more tense the complexion more lively the circula∣tion more quick the impressions of ob∣jects on the senses more strong and the soul again communicates with external objects When we have once fallen into a deep sleep we are not awakened from it but by very lively sensations but when the usual space of time allotted for rest is nearly expired the least noise awakes us and ever more easily the nearer we are to the hour of awaking so that the first de∣gree of sleep is scarcely to be distinguish∣ed from waking and its last degree is confounded therewith Sleep therefore comes on and goes off by insensible de∣grees similar in this respect to the ob∣scurity of night which gradually increases till it arrives at midnight darkness and af∣terwards decreases by the same gradation Let us therefore conclude that the fibres possess a greater degree of organic elasti∣city in Man when awake than when a∣sleep  It is then obvious that whilst the fibres are relaxed there is no regular se∣ries of thoughts the mind passes without any regularity over the sensations it has received its thoughts succeed each other in confusion and if at any time they form a regular series it is only whilst the fibres are tense In the agitations of a painful dream the thoughts are some∣what regular but in the mean time Man is greatly disturbed and when he afterwards awakes finds himself oppressed with fatigue and wet with sweat and tears  Thus it is only by the relaxation of the organic elasticity of our fibres that sleep interrupts the succession of our ideas the order of our thoughts therefore depends on the state of the body  I imagine the proofs already offered in support of this will be found satisfacto∣rily conclusive but that no proof may be wanting and that the principle may be incontrovertibly established let us examine the state of the body relatively to the suc∣cession of the ideas in madmen those liv∣ing examples of the vagaries or if you will of the rovings of this distempered state of human reason  There are many species of madness in every one of which the mind forms wrong judgments of things In each spe∣cies of madness sensations and ideas of every kind are produced but have neither order nor connexion and in this incohe∣rent succession in this chaos of sensations and thoughts the will acts not but lets the images of things succeed each other in disorder Attention not being suffi∣ciently strong the soul is not conscious of its thoughts so that illusion is often admitted amongst and intimately con∣nected with them  This however may be observed with re∣spect to the several species of madness that state of the soul which is accidental in the one is natural and constant in the other sorts but all equally result from an ina∣bility to attend this inability I shall de∣monstrate to be wholly dependent on the constitution of the body  Physiologists have sought in dead ani∣mals the causes of this disordered state of the soul in living animals as if it proceeded from the unnatural confor∣mation of some organ which must ne∣cessarily  always exist never dreaming that it might be occasioned by some change in the organic elasticity of the solids the only principle by which these phenomena can be explained A striking example of the illsuccess of most physiological en∣quiries and a proof that our efforts to dis∣cover truth serve often to mislead us and to remove us to a great distance from it  By comparing the state of the body of one that died in perfect enjoyment of rea∣son with that of one who died in a state of madness we shall undoubtedly disco∣ver many considerable differences such as the distension of the vessels of the  me∣ninges  the inflammation of these mem∣branes the extravasation of lymph into the  sinuses  of the brain the siccity of this  viscus  and of the origin of the nerves appearances commonly seen in the bodies of the latter but never in those of the former This difference which is here supposed to be the cause is only the ef∣fect Considered as the effect it may conduct us to the knowledge of the true principle but in our enquiries we shall proceed with greater success by compar∣ing  the state of the solids of a man in perfect reason with that of the solids of one who has lost it  The different species of madness may be reduced to two which are to be dis∣tinguished not by those vagaries of reason which are common to both but by the character of the thoughts they are de∣signed under two general denominations furious madness when the thoughts are daring and the emotions of the soul vehe∣ment  insanity  or  idiotism  when the emo∣tions of the soul and the thoughts are weakly expressed  There is a rigidity of the nervous sys∣tem when the rovings of the soul are at∣tended with fury as in frenzy inflamma∣tory fevers drunkenness and the hysteric affection there is a debilitation thereof when the same rovings are indicated in a tranquil and languid manner as in insa∣nity dotage and in that melancholy madness which is occasioned by the use of narcotics Every one may be convinced of this by simply inspecting a body in these different states and by examining the phenomena  With regard to that affection of the mind which is produced by drunkenness it is obvious that spirituous liquors are peculiarly adapted to produce a rigidity in the fibres  The saline particles with which these liquors are impregnated and the spirits with which they abound when received into the stomach first irritate its mem∣branes and being conveyed into the in∣testines irritate their coats this irrita∣tion is immediately followed by a spasm of these organs propagated through∣out the body by the correspondence of the nervous system which affects every part but more especially the  meninges  This violent tension of the meninges is presently after produced in a more direct manner the salts and the spirits gradually pass into the fluids and being conveyed to the brain with the blood increase the tension of its membranes and the circula∣tion is rendered more impetuous This violent spasm at intervals compresses the cavity of the nerves and interrupts in whole or in part the perflux of their fluid  hence proceed those irregular and convul∣sive motions of the muscles that stagger∣ing and total loss of sense and motion observed in persons who have died in a state of inebriation By comparing the tone of the solids of a drunkard with that of the solids of a temperate person we find the fibres moderately tense in the latter and extremely so in the former In drunk∣enness the countenance appears inflamed the eyes red and fiery the vessels of the face distended the limbs at first are flexi∣ble afterwards they are stiff and con∣vulsed the regularity of muscular motion is destroyed the body is unstable the senses are dull the sight is troubled and the objects looked upon seem to waver Here if we may judge by the senses is an ex∣treme tension of the fibres which very nearly approaches to rigidity and this ri∣gidity is proved on the testimony of facts  If this spasm be so visible in the strong and gross organs what must it be in the fibres of the  meninges  which are incom∣parably more delicate and more sensible  The effects which are produced in the solids in drunkenness by the irritating  and caustic particles of the liquors which have been drunk are produced in fevers in a much higher degree  They who are acquainted with the constitution of the human body and the causes of diseases know that fevers are always produced by a spasm of the irri∣  ated nervous parts  In the hysteric passion the spasm of the nervous system is ever considerably greater than in fevers but this spasm arises not instantaneously at first a numbness is felt about the hips and loins the abdomen and stomach are distended a painful oppression is felt at the breast anxieties at the heart a gene∣ral numbness and shivering of the whole body violent pain is felt in the head a tension in the forehead and temples the sight is troubled involuntary tears flow respiration is difficult the navel is drawn inwards the heart palpitates the pulse is hard and unequal the extremities become cold the  oesophagus  is closed respiration interrupted the voice dies away the mouth is convulsed the arms and hands are violently contracted the body is con∣torted and every limb agitated with con∣vulsive motions  Finally if we carefully examine the body of a madman we shall find the fibres to be tense the pulse extremely hard and unequal the eyes fiery as in rage and the body affected with convul∣sive motions more or less strong accord∣ing to the force of the frenzy but less ap∣parent than in the diseases mentioned above nor is their fury so extreme This extraordinary vigour these impe∣tuous motions these terrible convulsions which accompany drunkenness the hys∣teric passion frenzy and inflammatory fevers are evidently the effects of the violent influx of the nervous fluid into the muscles occasioned by the violent and ir∣regular contraction of the irritated me∣ninges That there is a spasm a rigidity in every case of this kind is obvious from the attendant symptoms and from the state of the organs of subjects which have not survived this disorder  In the dissection of hysteric women we almost always find every part of the body unaffected the organs of generation  excepted  See Vesalius L c De humani corporio fabrica Riolanus Antropol Lib pag Bin∣ninganus cent Q cap Manezeta Miscellan Curios Natur dec obs Diembroeck Lib Cap    In some the  testes  have been found distended with a thick and yel∣lowish liquor of a very offensive smell in others the  testes  spermatic vessels and vessels of the  uterus  were distended with a whitish lymph viscous and of a very pungent smell in others were found polypous excrescences adjoining to the  uterus  the  uterus  itself has been observed nearly filled with a fluid in colour as if tinged with saffron and cor∣rupted sometimes the membranes have been inflamed and distended with grumous and thick blood  From the symptoms accompanying this disease it is evident that the spasm of the nervous system occasioning the dis∣order of the functions of the body begins at the uterus which is irritated by the corrupted liquor contained in the sper∣matic vessels and is afterwards gradually propagated by the nerves to the other parts  even to the membranes of the brain where it sometimes leaves visible marks of irri∣tation  In subjects which have died of in∣flammatory fevers or of madness many ramifications of the  meninges  have been found distended and these membranes themselves inflamed  See Miscellan Curios Nat dec pag Anno dec pag Anno  in others have been discovered many sanious serosities in the ventricles of the brain many vesicles or rather  varices  full of sanious lymph and the  plexus choroides  in∣flamed in others the vessels of the  me∣ninges  were livid and full of thick blood many serosities were found in the ventri∣cles of the brain and a livid polypous concretion in the  sinus falciformis  the other parts of the body were sound the brain alone being affected  This dilatation of the blood vessels these  va∣rices  these distensions these extravasa∣tions of sanious serosities and inflamma∣tions of the membranes of the brain are evidently the effects of violent irregular  and obstructed circulation occasioned by the spasm of the nervous system and of the solids in general For when a part is affected with a spasm the vessels of which it is composed are violently contracted and as the coats of the arteries are more strong than those of the veins so much the more they resist their contraction the blood continues to flow on to that part with ease but in its return is ob∣structed whereby it accumulates in these vessels and excessively distends them hence these inflammations distensions and  varices  When the distension is extreme the vessels permit their contained fluid to permeate their coats hence those extra∣vasations of the lymph blood and those polypous excrescences which proceed therefrom Finally if we observe that caustic acrids as the  hyosciamum solanum verum  and generally every thing that ir∣ritates the nerves and renders them rigid either taken internally or applied outward∣ly produce the most terrible delirium and madness whilst lenients and antispasmodic medicines restore reason we shall be con∣vinced that this perturbed state of the  mind is wholly produced by the spasm of the nervous system but more especially by that of the membranes of the brain Hence it is evident that furious madness proceeds from a rigidity of the fibres I shall now shew that insanity or idiotism is occasioned by their relaxation  Insanity often succeeds madness and that instantaneously this phenomenon is very natural as the violent tension of the fibres must be followed by their relaxation when this debilitation is considerable and the organic elasticity of the fibres is so greatly impaired that it requires some considerable time before it can be restored the mind recovers not the tone adapted for reason it only changes the species of its folly This is more particularly observed in inflammatory fevers where furious madness opens the disease and idiotism concludes it Whilst the nerves are con∣vulsed and the circulation is vehement Man acts with violence his ideas are con∣fused he loses all knowledge and utters with a furious aspect incoherent expres∣sions but when the morbid humours have taken another course when the black  poison which occasions his disease is dis∣charged from his vessels weakened by the violence his transports he remains a long time destitute of strength de∣prived of reason insensible either of the evil or danger of his condition and is reduced to a state of infancy which is of so much the longer duration andthe debi∣litation of the elasticity of his fibres is more extreme for in these cases the ef∣fect is ever equal to the cause  To the foregoing may be added the analogy between the disposition of the soul and body during sleep and the dis∣position of these two substances during in∣sanity For this state of the soul whilst Man is awake perfectly corresponds to that whilst Man is asleep the succession of sensations is the same the exercise of thinking and the action of the organs are the same likewise in both the fibres are relaxed and the circulation languid whence it appears that these two states have similar causes  This kind of insanity is oftentimes produced by excessive study by violent passions by a considerable loss of semen  and by every thing which debilitates the organic elasticity of the fibres This is confirmed by comparative anatomy for the state of dotage that is when the sensations and ideas are combined without order is precisely the same as when the body is feeble the strength is exhausted and the organs are inelastic It is there∣fore obvious that this alienation of mind is the effect of the extreme impairing of the organic elasticity of our solids  Furious madness proceeds from the rigidity of the fibres idiotism or insanity from their relaxation and the slate adapted for reason from their moderate elasticity  such are the secret causes of the order which obtains in our thoughts Hence it appears that a greater or less degree of tension of the fibres can make a man either rational or insane Reason and madness must therefore depend on the mechanism of the body and not in the least on the soul as philo∣sophers have falsely supposed  Having contemplated these rovings of the soul and discovered their causes in the different tones of the fibres let us proceed to assign the reason of these phe∣nomena  A regular series of thoughts ever re∣quires in order to its formation that the mind be intent on the object of its judgments this intenseness of the mind is ever accompanied by that of the body During meditation the pulse beats more strongly than when we do not meditate and so much the more strongly as the soul is the more deeply engaged in medita∣tion Thus in cataleptics whilst the soul is involved in the most profound re∣flections the blood circulates with greater freedom and force the complexion be∣comes more lively respiration more free and every function of the body is more perfectly performed During meditation the whole body is violently tense but par∣ticularly the  plexus nervosi  and the mem∣branes of the brain  Too great or too long application in∣creases this tension even so far as to ex∣cite a stupor in the head and kindle up a fever in the veins studious persons fre∣quently experience this I myself have many times  The soul during meditation not only af∣fects the body with a degree of tension but  without its concurrence cannot operate alone In chronic diseases during a state of convalescence and after a considerable loss of semen we can neither reflect nor meditate whatever efforts we make we think very little and our ideas are vague and unconnected Even immediately af∣ter profound meditation the mind being fatigued indulges itself in roving al∣though the will oppose we indeed con∣tinue to think but our thoughts are alto∣gether irregular we remain awake but experience the effects of sleep imagina∣tion traces the same airy semblances the same fugitive shades as during sleep  No regular series of thoughts can be formed without a tension of the fibres this tension has fixed bounds determined limits beyond which the succession of our ideas cannot proceed When the fibres are too tense as in drunkenness in fevers and in violent head aches let us ever so much attempt to reflect all our efforts are vain the soul is either in a  delirium  or in a  stupor  It has been proved that in regular thought the understanding  See Book II Art Exercise of the understanding  is sub∣ject  to the will that this exercise of rea∣son requires a certain tone of the solids and that the tone of the solids necessary to reason has a certain extent this tone therefore must be constantly existent in Man whilst his organs are obedient to the will but is not found either in a state of rigidity or relaxation two states of the fibres which have this in common that they both equally free the body from subjection to the will  If we notice the power which certain aliments fruits and liquors have on the body we shall be convinced that it is su∣perior or at least equal to that of the soul over the material substance to which it is united Again if we compare the empire of the different faculties of the soul over the body we shall be convin∣ced  See Book III Obs  that the power of sensibility is much greater than that of the will and incomparably more so than that of the un∣derstanding or imagination That of sen∣sibility and imagination is universal that is it influences both the muscular fibres and their  fibrillae  the organs of sense and  motion whilst that of the will is restrain∣ed to the latter of these only But none of these faculties has any power over the body but by the nervous fluid when this is deficient or when it has lost its energy or even when the elasticity of the fibres is impaired it is obvious that the power of the will is at an end Even when this fluid is violently impelled into the muscular fibres either by sensibilty or by some other cause with greater im∣petuosity than the will can impel it it is evident that the rigidity is not removed but confirmed thereby if it proceed from a violent influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres  Hence the reason why the violent passi∣ons as rage fear terror affect us with a kind of momentary madness why the efforts we make to reflect when fatigued by meditation only serve to increase our inability to think in a word why the rigidity and total relaxation of the solids deprive the soul of the free exercise of its faculties and are the causes of madness the degree and force whereof is proportioned to that of their principle  Let us therefore conclude that  as the mind cannot act alone it ever requires the concurrence of the corporeal organs to reflect and meditate and that the unfolding of its faculties entirely depends upon organzation  I have now only to offer a few observa∣tions on the subsequent phenomena to confirm what has been said on the same subject elsewhere  See Book II Art Some singular phenomena ex∣plained concerning the effects of the passions on the understanding  Certain hypochon∣driacs see visions at midday and with their eyes open some fancy they behold a continued series of phantoms and hide∣ous spectres rapidly succeeding each other others a series of agreeable objects flit∣ting shades female forms magnificent scenes which offer themselves in succes∣sion and are seen like objects really ex∣isting so that the deception of these vi∣sionary representations is so strong that they believe them to be realities  When speaking of the colourings which the sentiments of the soul communicate to objects and of the illusions of the passi∣ons  analogous to the facts related above I observed that physiologists had attributed these phenomena to the nervous fluid and that to account for it they had imagin∣ed  that this fluid which is naturally subject to the empire of the soul be∣comes its superior in these affections that in the organ of sight particularly it assumes every successive modification representative of objects which had before affected it  I demonstrated that physiologists improperly confound the operations of the senses with those of the mind I likewise proved this phenome∣non to be very simple and only mysterious from our misapprehension of it I ob∣serve now as I did then that these visions of hypochondriacs are only sensations re∣newed from the memory the empty phan∣toms of a soul violently agitated wholly engrossed and misled by its pleasures or its pains and unable to return within it∣self to examine objects  I have already proved that the soul when strongly affected by any object is blind to every other it being no longer able to attend thereto I shall now offer a physical reason of this phenomenon  It is only by attention that we can dis∣tinguish in the soul the real impressions of things from sensations reproduced Be∣sides the presence of mind necessary to reflection requires in the fibres a certain de∣gree of tension the  medium  between rigi∣dity and relaxation In inflammatory fe∣vers and in the hypochondriac disease there is the same rigidity as in the inflam∣mation of the stomach contracted by the use of some acrid aliment or by poison for the irritation of this  viscus  affects the whole nervous system and more especially the membranes of the brain In all these cases reason is extinct for the will has no longer any power over the organs as has been already shewn Thus aban∣doned to itself the mind employs itself in reviewing the objects which formerly af∣fected it but wanting the attention ne∣cessary to discern whether their image be reproduced or not it mistakenly imagines them present and really existing  When the spasm ceases the mind in∣stantly recovers its reason these imaginary objects disappear the deception ceases the patient finds himself in his chamber  surrounded by his disconsolate friends and relates to them the subject of his visions  The same effects which are produced by acrid humours on the body in severs and by irritating aliments in the inflammation of the stomach are likewise produced by an inflamed imagination and by violent passions examples which confirm this daily occur to our observation  When the soul is engrossed by any vio∣lent passion when the imagination forms a lively picture of the charms of a favou∣rite object represents it as the idol of the heart adorns it with every attractive grace and suffers it to make a deep impression on the mind by degrees the charms in which we have cloathed and decked it dazzle the sight and impose even on our∣selves then wholly engaged thereby we are insensible to every other object and misled fo these phantoms we take our visions for realities  Thus in the extreme anxieties of a soul tormented by remorse the guilty wretch continually revolves in his mind every crime he has committed and re∣mains a miserable victim to despair Should  sleep close his eyes his sleep is only a frightful  delirium  the consciousness of his crimes preys upon his heart and terrifies him with horrid visions He dreams he hears the groans of those he has de∣stroyed thinks he sees their ghosts rising from their tombs and imprecating the justice of heaven on him the darkness of hell covers the face of the earth the furies hiss in his ears shake their torches at him and pursue and haunt him wherever he goes devils fiends every moniter in fable beset his soul harrassed with these horrible visions the wretch awakes in affright vents loud cries starts back with horror at the ap∣proach of his friends whom now he knows not and clasps the next thing he finds in his arms and fancies he clings to the altar  Thus it is that the passions produce visi∣ons and trances thus it is that enthusiasm is changed into a delirium and thus it is that fanatic minds sometimes fancy them∣selves inspired  This discourse on the succession of our ideas and the order which obtains in our  thoughts recalls me to the point from whence I first set out I then proved that the depth the justness and sublimity of ideas required fibres strong and greatly elastic and that these characters of our ideas varied together with the organization but the different degrees of the strength and elasticity of these organs in different individuals which at first appeared of so little consequence produce other very surprising effects This principle simple as it is abounds in consequences it is this which enables us to discover truths hitherto concealed from the learned and involved in profound darkness Let us endeavour to draw from this hidden source some additional knowledge which may throw light on some very obscure subjects and scatter flowers over the thorny paths of philosophy  Organization renders Imagination the predo∣minant Character of the  MIND  The exercise of regular thought is to the mind what voluntary motion is to the body that is a state of constraint which  the soul commonly yields to with reluc∣tance and ever endures with pain  If we follow the mind in its operations we shall observe that when abandoned to its own activity it acts without rule and without method it never acts with order but when necessity  See Book II Art Regular thought considered re∣latively to the degree of attention which it requires  obliges it thereto and returns to its former state immediately when freed from restraint What renders the regular exercise of thought more fatiguing than the irregular is the attention which it requires the dif∣ficulty of fixing objects in the mind in order to consider them  Ibidem  without distrac∣tion and the efforts which are necessary to discern their different relations efforts so much the more painful as the objects happen to be naturally volatile and fall not within the cognizance of the senses But what renders these efforts painful is that tension of the fibres which this in∣tenseness of the mind requires for the tension of the fibres ever produces in the soul an unpleasing sentiment more or less  strong but ever proportionate to its force We must therefore constantly recur to phy∣sical causes to account for these phenomena of the mind  By following the mind in its operations it is easy to discover that when it ceases to consider objects attentively it no longer judges of their true relations in this case thought becomes imagination Thus of all the sciences geometry requires the least aid from imagination as it continually fixes the attention on one particular ob∣ject  It is not that he who discovers a demonstration has no occasion for invention but that the demonstra∣tion being once discovered others have only to pursue it only the inventor of a science has occasion to rea∣son those who succeed him have no more to do than to repeat his reasonings    I have demonstrated that regular thought fatigues the mind much more  See Book II Art Regular thought considered re∣latively to the degrees of attention which it requires  and much sooner than revery I have likewise shewn that when the mind is fatigued it no longer fixes upon any object and ceases to consider attentively  Book III Obs  I have shewn  that the attention of the mind is ever pro∣portionate  Book IV Art Organization renders the under∣standing extensive just superficial confined errone∣ous or gross c  to the strength and organic elasticity of the fibres Whence let us conclude that a  soul united to a delicate and feeble body must possess more imagination than judgment  The transition from reason to imagina∣tion is very easy If the mind during reflection be distracted by any sensation it loses sight of its objects is engaged by some analogous relation and wanders from one to another till it entirely loses its first engagement it at length perceives itself bewildered in the labyrinths of imagination even whilst it fancies it∣self attentively pursuing its former re∣flections The greater the sensibility the more difficult it is to prevent these wanderings  whence it follows that the Man whose organs are delicate and greatly sensible must possess more imagination than judgment  If the transition from reason to imagi∣nation be very easy it is likewise very  natural Whatever our thoughts may be' some secret attractive some hidden charm recalls the mind to its favourite subject The soul ever delighted with pleasing sentiments resigns itself wholly thereto and its natural love of happiness prompts it to perpetuate the pleasure it takes there∣in The mind thus relishing those pleasures wishes to increase them where∣fore it successively occupies itself in exa∣mining one after another all the agreea∣ble objects which are in any way connec∣ted with those which affect it with de∣light and thus thought becomes imagi∣nation Man therefore has perpetual need to be on his guard against these wanderings and the more so in proportion to his greater share of sensibility for in this case the at∣attraction of pleasure is most powerful In this respect therefore  the soul which is united to very sensible and elastic organs pos∣sesses more of imagination than of judgment  Organization characterises the  THOUGHTS  Organization not only determines our aptitude either for imagination or for  judgment but also often forms the cha∣racter of our thoughts  When the exercise of the understand∣ing is wholly imagination the nature of its images and ideas is ever determined  This is very evident in the  furor uterinus  a dis∣ease produced by the irritating quality of the semen depraved by a too long continuance in the secretory vessels and in the  incubus  or nightmare  by that of the sensation or sentiment then affecting the mind If this sentiment or sensation be agreeable there is a series of pleasing illusions and agreeable images if painful there is a succession of sad and hideous representations The same phe∣nomenon is also evident during sleep our dreams are pleasing or terrifying accord∣ing to the sensations we then experience  If we take a retrospective view of what we have said concerning the succession of our ideas when speaking of the exercise of our mental faculties we shall find this phenomenon very simple The mind if left to itself ever proceeds by analogies the thoughts therefore must be gay when the soul is affected with pleasure and sad when affected with pain  The impressions received by the organs of the body are conveyed to the soul fix there and serve as a point of departure from whence it sets out when it commen∣ces its future operations from this time forwards it is engaged by analogous images and analogous thoughts only  And as the soul ever perceives the dis∣position of the body during sleep although it appears to be then freed from its sub∣jection to the senses the same analogy must be observed in man asleep as when awake Hence the reason why the nature of dreams is ever analogous to the state of the body and to the sensation then af∣fecting the mind Hence too the reason why when the sensation is agreeable we enjoy during sleep a series of pleasing de∣ceptions and agreeable images but when it is painful are terrified with dismal thoughts and frightful illusions  What has been said above concerning the imagination is properly applicable to irregular thought only its regular pro∣ductions require the same physical dispo∣sition which reason does  The mind must compare and combine its sensations and its thoughts in many dif∣ferent  shapes to form new productions therefrom this requires attention and consequently force and elasticity in the fibres  Thus imagination is weakened by degrees together with the organic elasticity of the fibres in proportion as they become more lax or more rigid the mind cannot compare or combine its sensations and becomes inac∣tive even so far as to be no longer able ei∣ther to imagine or to invent  it then ceases to draw consequences from principles and only acts by the aid of the senses  Nevertheless if regular imagination re∣quires the elasticity of our organs it re∣quires it in a less degree than reason for its objects are neither necessarily depen∣dant on each other nor closely connected its productions are only detached parts where the mind has nothing to do but to weave them into one tissue Finally be∣cause their connection depends not on the combination of a great number of thoughts or ideas which are naturally profound and difficult to be investigated as those of reason commonly are a single stroke of the pencil shall frequently serve to con∣nect the parts of which the group is to be  composed And although regular imagi∣nation may be a state of constraint like reason it nevertheless fatigues the soul much less for imagination has ever the choice of its subjects and this choice is ever directed towards agreeable objects whilst reason ever tied down to follow nature must needs frequently find an irksomeness from painful researches and dry reflections and is ever busied in a disgustful employ∣ment Imagination therefore not only re∣quires less attention than reason but also possesses many pleasing attractives besides  Imagination requires less force of the or∣gans than reason but a greater share of organic elasticity of the fibres or rather a greater share of sensibility  For it is not always by a careful examination of ob∣jects nor by a series of many successive combinations that the imagination forms new productions the most happy strokes of fancy often present themselves to the mind spontaneously when we least think and are never the fruit of pains or plod∣ding It is therefore only by vaiously combining objects by leaving if I may be allowed the expression the mind to  rove at will and by employing no more attention than is necessary to collect the result of its thoughts and to se∣lect therefrom such as are for its pur∣pose The greater our sensibility the more liable we are to distraction the more affected by analogies the less at∣tached to material objects and the more capable of those happy but fortuitous combinations the true source of inge∣nious sallies and of the noblest produc∣tions of the human mind  Thus therefore men who have but lit∣tle sensibility and are of robust organs can possess but a small share of imagina∣tion men who are but little sensible and yet delicate must possess more They who are feeble and of great sensibility yet greater and they who are extremely vigorous and extremely sensible most of all Eager to rise above the sphere of the senses these can alone soar above this low world and with a bold wing traversing the boundless tracts of aether transport themselves to worlds unexplored before  I have proved that reason is not es∣sential to the soul and that the imagina∣tion  depends on the elasticity and force of the fibres I shall now demonstrate that remembrance and recollection are modes of the soul's existence and wholly depen∣dent on organization  Remembrance and Recollection dependent on Organization  Memory is almost always confounded with remembrance and recollection qua∣lities very different and which ought to be carefully distinguished  See Book II Art Of remembrance and recol∣lection  Memory or the faculty of retaining our sensations and ideas is peculiar to the soul and inde∣pendent of every physical cause but remem∣brance and recollection the one where∣of is the faculty of discerning our sensati∣ons and ideas when reproduced to be those which we have before received and the o∣ther that of reproducing them at will al∣though intellectual powers nevertheless wholly depend on organization  Acute diseases of a long continuance ever impair both remembrance and recol∣lection chronic diseases are ever accom∣panied with the same phenomenon but more especially the  hernia spinalis  when the tumor is opened and even still more than this those sleepy diseases which ensue from a considerable loss of semen  See Book III Observations and  Great drinkers apoplectics those unfortunate per∣sons who have undergone the operation of the trepan those who have been covered after hanging frequently pass the residue of life unable either to remember or to recollect  The microcephali whose brain is of smaller dimensions than common are ge∣nerally destitute of these faculties  Finally in the history of the academy of sciences of Paris Année pag we find the case of a child eight years of age that lost its  Even here remembrance and recollection are sig∣nified as I observed above although the term memory be made use of  memory by the ex∣cessive heats of summer and never reco∣vered it whilst the heats continued  Since the influence of the body on the soul has fixed and constant relations the de∣cay and loss of remembrance or recollection are therefore produced by causes common to every instance abovementioned By what these cases have in common it clearly ap∣pears that the cause of this decay and loss of these powers is only the diminu∣tion of the organic elasticity of the ner∣vous system but more especially of the membranes of the brain a diminution common to every subject here noticed but produced in different ways In the one by a defect of the nervous fluid as in  microcephali  and those who have been ex∣hausted by immoderate coition in others by a violent tension of the fibres as in apoplectics those who have been recalled to life after hanging and those who have under gone the operation of the trepan in others by these two causes united as in persons affected with acute or chronic diseases  We shall be fully convinced of this truth if we consider that every thing which im∣pairs the tone of the solids either by vi∣tiating the secretion of the nervous fluid in the brain or restraining its action pro∣duces  the same effect The immoderate use of cooling liquors spirits  opium hy∣osciamum  and other narcotics long and profound sadness fear terror and every other violent passion of the soul too long continued watching and too profound me∣ditation all which are adapted to destroy the elasticity of the fibres occasion the loss of remembrance and recollection Fi∣nally the decay and even the loss of these powers are often occasioned by ex∣cessive heat in this case it is visibly pro∣duced by the diminution of organic elasti∣city Every thing concurs to establish the loss of elasticity as the cause of this phe∣nomenon as I have observed in collect∣ing the different observations made upon this subject and reducing to fixed points their numerous variations  If more proofs were required I would here repeat what has been said elsewhere concerning the order of our thoughts On the approach of sleep and at the close of wearisome meditation when the fibres relax and the circulation is languid when the senses are inactive and every organ is at rest the soul appears to be then detached from the body and wanders without any  scope remembrance is lost we recollect nothing not even things which are the most familiar When sleep closes the eyes objects which affect us whilst awake are retraced in the mind but the mind remembers them not and this forgetful∣ness is so much the more extreme as the sleep is more profound that is as the fi∣bres are more relaxed the mind recovers not these powers till the elasticity of the fibres is reestablished by repose  But if the loss of remembrance and re∣collection be often produced by the relax∣ation of the fibres it is sometimes occasi∣oned by their rigidity In inflammatory fevers in drunkenness nothing is remem∣bered nothing recollected How fre∣quently are seen persons when affected with either of these that know not their friends children wives and even forget their own name How many have been reduced to the same miserable state from the irritation of the meninges by splinters of the  crani∣um  or by some extraneous body  Remembrance and recollection therefore require a moderate degree of tension of the fibres as does the regular exercise of thought  The reason of this phenomenon is easily comprehended Memory is a passive fa∣culty but remembrance and recollection are the  See Book II Art Of recollection and remem∣brance  results of our several intellectual faculties combined The one is the state of reflecting on the sensations and the ideas deposited in the memory the other is a state of intenseness by which the soul forces itself to recall these sensations and these ideas Remembrance and recollec∣tion therefore of necessity require atten∣tion and consequently a moderate degree of organic elasticity in the fibres It is therefore obvious that when the subjects of our observations have not the power of rendering the fibres tense the mind is de∣void of these powers  Hence we must conclude that remem∣brance and recollection are determined by the tone of the solids and even depend on organization  Hitherto I have shown how the differ∣ent degrees of the elasticity of the fibres contribute to the diversity of minds and  how this mechanism explains these phe∣nomena reconciles them to Nature if I may be allowed the expression and divests them of the marvellous this cause how∣ever simple it may appear produces ma∣ny other very surprising effects  Organization renders  MAN  intelligent or stupid  Penetration that noble faculty of the mind by which we discern truth amidst the darkness surrounding it by which we discover the most remote relations of things depends on the tone of the fibres and on the state of the body equally with remembrance and recollection for being wholly owing to the capacity of the mind  See Book II Art Penetration stupidity c  and to the number of ideas and sensations it consequently must depend on the number of the senses and on their good organization  Nevertheless the senses of an idiot appear sound and well con∣stituted he has likewise as other per∣sons have sensations of every kind  and he arranges them in the same order when he acts like others but he has but very few ideas and is deficient in judgment and penetration  Penetration depends on the number of the senses and their good organization  but de∣pends not wholly thereon To discover the relations of things it is not sufficient to have a great number of sensations there is also necessary the power of calling them to mind when occasion requires With∣out this faculty the sensations deposited in the memory would be useless without it the mind could compare its present sensa∣tions only all its judgments would be de∣termined by the senses and Man no longer act as Man but as the most stupid of beasts Besides the number of the senses and their good organization  penetration likewise requires the same elasticity and force in the fibres as recollection  But even this will not suffice To dis∣cover the relations of things the mind must compare them in their different as∣pects and variously combine them Ex∣cept this admitting every other qualifica∣tion the best organized senses the most  ardent desire of attaining perfection yet so long as Man continues unable to com∣bine his sensations it will be impossible for him to acquire knowledge  Penetra∣tion therefore requires the same organic elas∣ticity of the fibres as reflection  Every man has a certain number of sensations but all men have not equally the power of recalling comparing com∣bining and arranging them qualities in∣dispensibly necessary to the discovery of concealed relations These qualities idiots have not and this inability to recollect or reflect is to be wholly attributed to the state of their organs  If we compare the body of an idiot with the body of a rational person we shall find many considerable diversities between them The most conspicuous is the small dimensions of the  cerebrum Microcephali  See Book III Obs  are idiots by nature they have neither conception nor judgment on the contra∣ry  macrocephali  are very ingenious  Another difference is the bulk of the body in comparison of the size of the  head Extremely large and fat persons are commonly but a small remove from stupidity whilst small and lean persons are generally the reverse  But all idiots are not so by nature some gradually arrive at that state the most in∣genious equally with others Acute dis∣eases of long continuance  See Book III Obs  and likewise chronic diseases impair the penetration The considerable loss of nervous fluid ei∣ther by coition by its discharge from the tumor of the  hernia spinalis  or by exten∣sive exercise produces the same effects Great drinkers apoplectics they who have undergone the operation of the tre∣pan they who have been recovered after hanging remain very long without con∣ception and without judgment  Let us attend to the reason of these phe∣nomena  Microcephali  are idiots  macrocephali  ve∣ry sagacious But if penetration be ever proportionate to the dimensions of the brain it is not from any particular orga∣nization of this  viscus  as some have ima∣gined  The brain is only an organ of se∣cretion and is without relation to the soul except by its secreting a greater or less quantity of the nervous fluid and as its volume might more or less obstruct the ori∣gin of the nerves by compressing the mem∣branes which surround it it is only in these respects that the brain can influence penetration  It has been already shewn that the ex∣ercise of regular thought such as is ne∣cessary to penetration requires a tension of the fibres particularly of those of the  meninges  This tension this augmenta∣tion of the organic elasticity of the solids arises from the immediate influx of the nervous fluid impelled into these organs by the will The more this fluid so im∣mediately subject to the soul in voluntary motion  See Book I Art Of the different motions of the body  abounds the more strongly Man can apply his mind to reflection and the longer continue it for the power of the will on our organs never prevails so far as to render them rigid Hence it is  evident that  microcephali  who are not abundantly supplied therewith must ne∣cessarily be stupid and that  macrocephali  who possess it in great abundance must be perfectly the reverse Hence it is that large and very fat persons have in general but little sagacity for the bulk of the body continually increases and the size of the brain continues the same This enor∣mous bulk of body compared to the di∣mension of the brain places them in the same class with  microcephali  This inability in  microcephali  and in those who are extremely fat to increase the organic elasticity of their fibres often destroys the penetration of the most saga∣cious To this is owing that stupidity which affects those who have been reco∣vered after hanging apoplectics those who have suffered the operation of the trepan and hard drinkers It is this like∣wise which after acute and chronic dis∣eases deprives men of the faculty of con∣ception and reduces them to a state of infancy  Hence is the reason that when an in∣flammatory fever has consumed the ner∣vous  fluid and fatigued our organs by vio∣lent and precipitate motions the mind is affected with a stupor all its faculties are disordered and all knowledge lost this returns not but in proportion as the body acquires strength and arrives not to its former perfect state till the body has en∣tirely recovered its former vigour  Hence the reason why the violent passi∣ons profound sadness and narcotics pro∣duce a kind of momentary stupidity  Hence the reason why some persons have become stupid by imitating too affi∣diously the gestures of folly  It is therefore evident that the extreme impair of the organic elasticity of the fibres generates stupidity and that the penetration of every individual depends on his orga∣nization  Organization renders  MAN  sagacious or dull sedate or volatile and the Judgment clear or confused  Nature has greatly varied the degrees of the delicacy and vivacity of minds Sa∣gacity that quickness of understanding  in discerning the reason of things that admirable faculty of comprehending at once a multitude of objects or rather of re∣viewing them with rapidity and penetrat∣ing in an instant the most remote rela∣tions observes not the same gradation as penetration This increases and decays by insensible degrees the other has no progression but has its existence confined as it were to an indivisible point  Sagacity consists in readily discovering remote relations Thus besides the num∣ber and order of our sensations and ideas necessary to discover those relations it re∣quires quick apprehension hence not only the same physical disposition is ne∣cessary as in penetration that is force and organic elasticity of the fibres but al∣so the most perfect degree of this elastici∣ty or which is the same thing that degree which is best adapted to second the acti∣vity of the will for the exercise of the understanding in penetration is voluntary The regular exercise of thought requires a certain organic tone of the fibres but this tone is not limited to one particular point it has a certain extent contained  between the opposite extremes of relaxa∣tion and rigidity Madness and stupidity are produced by the extremes wisdom holds the middle station and its various degrees occupy the whole interval between them there are therefore different de∣grees in this intermediate space in every one of which the soul may possess pene∣tration It is in that degree of elasticity where the fibres have a greater aptitude to yield obedience to the will that the dis∣position to sagacity consists Thus  the abundance of nervous fluid  This is true even with respect to the instinct of animals where nature seems to prompt every ac∣tion for although they have particular inclinations although one may be more or less savage more or less cruel than another we shall nevertheless find them to be all stupid in proportion as they are in want of this fluid and that the sagacity of every one is according to the dimensions of the brain    the primitive elasticity of the fibres and that degree where the equilibrium between these two powers is most perfect must be the principle of saga∣city of invention of that divine enthusiasm which animates genius and distinguishes those who possess it from the herd of common wits  Sagacity therefore falls to the lot of those who are endued both with vigour and sen∣sibility These are the qualities which alone actuate those towering minds which soar to the first principles of science and rapidly rush to the goal whilst others lag far behind and advance with slow and tardy steps  In proportion as this  equilibrium  between these two powers is destroyed the mind necessarily loses its sagacity but in a diffe∣rent manner if the balance be in favour of the solids if the fibres be either too lax or too rigid the mind is less apt to recall the sensations and ideas deposited in the memory or to compare them and less readily discovers their remote relations The mind is therefore less active takes up longer time in its reflection and is slower in tracing any analogy or investigating any truth Man thus organized may pos∣sess judgment but not wit The farther he is from this perfect degree of organic elasticity the more his activity of mind is diminished he may even be at such a distance from it as to possess no powers of imagina∣tion at all In this state he can pronounce  on the relations of those objects only which immediately act on the senses and principles to such a person are without consequences Hence the reason why sal∣lies of wit happy flights of any kind never occur to us when the mind is fa∣tigued  But when this  equilibrium  between the fibres and nervous fluid which forms Man's disposition to sagacity is destroyed and the scale inclines to the latter vivacity of mind becomes volatility The soul being then strongly affected by the most minute  See Book I Art Of the organs of sense consi∣dered relatively to their different degrees of sensibility  objects reacts  See Book IV Art Why the character of the soul is ever congruous to the state of the body  on the body with a force proportionate thereto communicates to this fluid a very strong impulse which acting upon weak fibres renders them rigid and destroys sagacity together with the free exercise of the un∣derstanding  To this sensibility add the delicacy which is inseparable from it and which ren∣ders us incapable of sustaining for any long  time that laborious attention which is often necessary to the discovery of remote relations Thus too hasty in pronouncing on the relations of things the mind al∣ways falls short of the end which it de∣sires to attain forms forced reasonings and continues for ever ignorant  The ideas to be just must be distinct al∣though these qualities are not inseparable Thus in every case where justness of our ideas requires them to be numerous the mind if united to a body of very deli∣cate texture and extreme sensibility can scarce conceive any thing distinctly In a man so circumstanced the mind has not time to examine throughly any of the objects as they offer they shift so fast that he has hardly time to perceive them  Hence the mind can have only imper∣fect notions of things and all its know∣ledge is but a confused huddle of errors and absurdities  Organization contributes to render  MAN  either prudent or inconsiderate  The soul united to weak elastic and delicate organs being continually acted upon by strong sensations and sentiments displays them the moment it is affected by them  See Book IV How organization renders Man openhearted or a dissembler  Such a person therefore is inca∣pable of dissimulation Endued with too great sensibility to dissemble he is like∣wise too much so to reflect to secure his purposes to comply with and bend to cir∣cumstances or patiently pursue a scheme till he finds some clue which may serve to guide him Hence he is incapable of that circumspection which conceals hidden resources till it sees a fit occasion to make use of them he knows not what to con∣ceal but tells the whole of what he knows and thus betrays his own secrets Impru∣dent in discourse he is so likewise in his designs and actions his ardor ever carries him to lengths little suited to his strength and by the improper use he makes of it almost all his efforts prove ineffectual in  a word he is neither fit for executing nor for counsel  Prudence therefore depends on that state of the machine on that tone of the fibres which promotes the free exercise of thinking by moderating the vivacity of the sensitive fa∣culty  Only the Man whose organs are thus formed can be severe yet gentle tender though not weak and highspiri∣ted without being a  bravado  he alone can conceal his designs under the veil of silence and be at once communicative and discreet This calm this exter∣nal serenity proceeds therefore from a natural coolness of temper and it is to the want of sensibility in our organs that this boasted wisdom this prudence we va∣lue ourselves so much upon are owing  Why  MAN  appears to lose some of his mental Faculties without losing the others  Some men lose the power of meditat∣ing yet retain their other faculties Some lose remembrance imagination the power of reflection yet retain that of recollec∣tion and judgment some forget one kind  of ideas one sort of knowledge without prejudice to others in a word some seem to lose every mental power instinct ex∣cepted  The most celebrated philosophers to ac∣count for these phenomena have imagin∣ed a system plausible at first sight but in reality exceedingly absurd They have first supposed contrary to truth that each faculty of the soul has some particular or∣gan for its seat entirely disjoined from and without relation to the others They have afterwards laid it down as a maxim that when one of these organs is vitiated the faculty resident therein is depraved likewise Finally to make this system quadrate with facts they have concluded that in the general disarrangement of the machine every part of which is intimate∣ly connected these different organs seats of the different faculties  See the Physiology of Le Cat tome I page Paris edition  are not all af∣fected at the same time  To elucidate these phenomena I shall not undertake a mysterious explanation  which supposes us to be endowed with know∣ledge which we have not nor imitate the explanations of others which are equally repugnant to reason and experience All these phenomena which appear so whim∣sical and so impossible to account for ac∣cording to the system of these philoso∣phers are so very simple according to that which is here established that the only thing to be wondered at is their simplicity We have seen that reason imagination re∣membrance recollection penetration sa∣gacity c are powers of the mind de∣pendent on the different tones of the or∣ganic elasticity of the fibres It is there∣fore evident that these effects must dis∣appear with their causes I shall attempt farther to develope this principle and give it the clearest evidence of truth  These faculties of the soul viz sensi∣bility will memory and understanding have different functions as has been al∣ready proved but these faculties unite and combine in many different manners from these their combinations result thought and the different operations of the mind But unless they act conjunct∣ly  Man has neither sentiments nor ideas their separation destroys every operation of the mind and in appearance annihilates the faculties themselves  Although these different faculties mutu∣ally combine they however combine not all in the same act according as their combination varies so much the more different are their results Besides though our intellectual faculties are the sole prin∣ciples of the operations of the soul and although some are active of themselves their exercise is nevertheless entirely de∣pendent on the body The mind cannot proceed alone it ever requires a certain degree of organic elasticity in the fibres to think reflect meditate c From these different degrees of the organic elas∣ticity of the fibres results every diversity in the operations of the mind  Regular thought ever requires a tension of the fibres but to think on some parti∣cular subjects there is required a much greater degree of organic elasticity in the fibres than to think on some others as on metaphysical subjects than on those of elementary geometry there is likewise  required a much greater degree of organic elasticity to meditate than to reflect to imagine something new than to judge of simple facts Thus with one degree of organic elasticity Man can reflect with another meditate so with one he can imagine and with another weaker degree which leaves him unable to recall the ideas and sensations formerly deposited in the memory he can pronounce on his pre∣sent sensations only and seems to have lost every faculty but instinct with a degree yet weaker than this he is unable to com∣bine two single sensations and is destitute of every sentiment even that of his own existence  Thus Man may lose the power of me∣ditation and retain that of reflection he may lose imagination sagacity and pene∣tration and retain good sense lastly he may lose judgment and yet retain instinct  Both remembrance and recollection re∣quire the organic elasticity of the fibres but not in an equal degree Recollection requires the greater degree of tension of the two as any one may be convinced by the efforts which a mind exhausted by  study or during the state of convales∣cence or drowsiness vainly makes to re∣call the most familiar ideas such as when called to mind by being mentioned by others it remembers to have before receiv∣ed This is very natural for it requires more attention to fix on an absent ob∣ject than on one which is present to re∣call an analogy without the aid of the sen∣ses as in remembrance by the assistance of objects than to discover its identity Man therefore may lose recollection and yet retain remembrance  Finally a greater degree of organic e∣lasticity is required to recall extraordinary ideas than to recollect those which are fa∣miliar and abstract ideas than simple so likewise Man may forget one particular sort of ideas and yet retain another Thus the different degrees of organic elasticity of the fibres produce new combinations which interrupt the succession of our thoughts disorder the chain of our ideas and seem even to annihilate some of ous mental faculties while they leave us the free exercise of others This is the sim∣ple and manifest cause of these singular phenomena  The different degrees of organic elas∣ticity required in the different operations of the mind may be determined by com∣paring the course of the fluids the num∣ber of pulsations their different degrees of force and vivacity in one man during meditation in another during reflection and in another during revery and by comparing the course of the fluids the number of pulsations their different de∣grees of force and vivacity in the same man in all these different states  Thus having shewn the principles of these phenomena in the different tones of the fibres having discovered the truth of these laws in Nature we may easily proceed to estimate their effects notwith∣standing this subject may be extremely complicated and may appear to have but little connection with mathematics it is possible to determine their relations and to subject them to a precise evaluation the balance has been already pointed out it now remains only to take the amount  From what has preceded it is certain that the propensities the affections and cha∣racter of the soul folly wisdom stupidity  prudence reason imagination recollection remembrance penetration delicacy sublimity depth sagacity and genius are not qualities inherent in the mind but modes of the soul's existence depending on the state of the organs of the body  as for instance colours sounds heat cold c are not essential attributes of matter but qualities dependent on its texture and on the motion of its constitu∣ent corpuscles It is therefore evident that organization alone causes almost  Let it be once more noticed that I pretend not to subject the  whole  to physical laws I am well assured that the soul  partly  receives its character from moral causes  every difference which is observed between souls that they receive their principal cha∣racteristics from the corporeal organs and that supposing them really in their na∣ture different from each other this dif∣ference would be of no effect so long as they continue united to the body  Thus every thing in Nature is influenced by physical laws  Corporeal sensibility the regular or disor∣dered course of our fluids primitive or or∣ganic  elasticity the rigidity or relaxation of the fibres the force or volume of the organs are the causes of the surprising diversities in souls and the secret principles of that great influ∣ence of the soul on the body and of the body on the soul hitherto deemed an impenetrable mystery  Such are the secret causes of that sin∣gular harmony which philosophers have observed between the two substances which form our being but were unable to explain  Such in a word are the true founda∣tions the solid basis of a science where∣in every thing appeared arbitrary obscure and mysterious  I would here conclude my work were philosophers only to be my readers to such it might be sufficient to explain the principles on which I ground my doctrine and I might have spared myself the trou∣ble of entering into these particulars which are necessary to elucidate them But this were lost labour since for one reader who can develop the whole of a system by the mere outlines there are a thou∣sand who must see the whole chain of rea∣soning  in order to comprehend the prin∣ciples on which it is established  To these it is necessary to enter into a minute discussion it is not enough that they have given them a clue to guide them to the truth and have the path pointed out to them they must be as it were led by the hand through all the mazes of the labyrinth otherwise they must una∣voidably be bewildered in it  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME  ERRATA
