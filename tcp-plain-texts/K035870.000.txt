 THE Sincerity of the Dissenters VINDICATED From the Scandal of  Occasional Conformity  WITH Some Considerations on a late Book Entitul'd  Moderation a Vertue    LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCIII  THE INTRODUCTION  THE Defenders of  Occasional Conformity  are at last come to a Point They have given up the Cause so far as ever the first Opposer pusht it at them The Author of a Book call'd  Moderation a Virtue  has very ingenuously Acknowledg'd all that was desir'd  And indeed a Man of his Candor could do no less since he is of too penetrating a Judgment not to know and of too much Honesty of Principles not to own that 'tis impossible to be Defended  Wherefore I think it cannot give Offence either to him or to any Body else to Publish the Conclusion of the Argument in his own Words and to let all Men know  That 'tis Granted by the Dissenters  That to Conform to the Church of  England  and receive the Sacrament meerly to Qualify for a Civil Employment is a scandalous Practice a Reproach to Religion and Offensive to all good Christians    If therefore for the future any Dissenter shall be Guilty of this scandalous reproachful Practice let no Man reflect upon the Body of the Dissenters for an Error of a single Member he is to bear the Burthen himself for his Mistake is his own the Party disowns the Practice  But the Defenders of this Occasional License are like a resolute Garrison who being Beaten out of a Town retire to the Castle the open and scandalous Conformity of such People who too notoriously used it as a Qualification for Civil  Employments appearing too low a Step to bear a Defence they have politickly drawn in a great many honest wellmeaning Gentlemen to side with the thing on account of a General Charity and its being Lawful in its own Nature  The Meaning is that having brought People to be Reconcil'd to the thing in it self it may look the less odious in the other Circumstances of it  But for what yet appears this Shift will fail too and all that has been yet said does not seem to me to clear it up  God forbid that I should say Conforming to the Church of  England  abstractedly and singly consider'd is a Sin But I cannot see the least Argument to prove what I alledge to be untrue  viz  That 'tis a Sin in a Dissenter to Conform to the Church of  England  or else his Dissenting is a Sin and he ought to Repent of one or of the other  This I think will appear when all the Authorities for this Occasional Compliance are Examined and  as I trust they shall be  fairly Confuted  This is what none of our Opponents have yet replied to but continue to fetch a compass round it and Reply to Things which really are not of so much Consequence in the Case  THE  Sincerity of the Dissenters  VINDICATED  c  IN the Argument against  Occasional Conformity  'tis not improper to observe There are two Sorts of People blame the  Dissenters    Their Brethren Dissenters who cannot Satisfy themselves in the same Latitude of Principles  The Strict Conformist  To me it seems as necessary to Examine the Different Reasons of these Opponents as it is to Examine the Lawfulness of the Fact and as it is a part of the Dispute which has not yet been brought upon the Stage it may be very useful to bring Parties to a right Understanding  'Tis most certain That these two Parties do not Cavil at the  Occasional Conformity  of the Dissenters from the same Principle nor with the same End and Design  The Stricter  Dissenter  Argues against it from a Conscientious Dislike of the Practice the  Militant Churchman  from a Dislike of the Consequence the  Dissenter  is against the Communicating as a Religious  Error the  Churchman  as a Politick One the  Dissenter  Explodes it as a Sin against the Reputation and Interest of the  Dissenter  the  Churchman  as a Sin against the Interest of the  Church  the  Dissenter  as it weakens the  Dissenters  and prepares their Members to fall off and Posterity to Conform totally to what their Fathers Conform'd to  Occasionally  the  Churchman  dislikes it as it lets the  Whigs  into Places and State Employments and weakens the Party that are to carry on other Designs  As the difference of Design is manifest so the Arguments on both sides exceedingly differ  The  Dissenter  Charges the  OccasionalMan  with Breach of his relative Engagements to Church Societies deserting his first Principles Condemning his first Dissent and the like But the  Churchman  with Hypocrisy Tricking and Undermining the Government Defeating the Laws and the like  As to the last I cannot but blame the Heat of these Men who cry out upon the  Dissenters  as Cheats and Hypocrites tho' at the same time I cannot approve the practice of  Occasional Conformity  as such  As to the Trick put upon the State by the  Dissenters  it is either an unjust Charge or it is but a Return in kind since 'tis plain that the Test was it self a Trick being pretended to be not against them but the  Papists  and is by a strain of Words bent at the  Dissenters  to serve a Turn And allow it had been the Sence of the Law 'tis plain by the Consequence it was not made to bring the  Dissenters  to Church but to keep them out of the Government which since the  Dissenters  have prevented by complying they are angry the Trick is discovered  The Author of these Sheets freely owns himself an Opposer of  Occasional Conformity  but 'tis because he  would have the  Dissenters  preserve what he has often advanc'd in their Favour  viz That they are really  Dissenters  for Conscience Sake  and this he conceives cannot be reconcil'd to an Occasional complying with that from which they had before Dissented and on account whereof they could justify a Separation from the Establish'd Church  This being premis'd the Defenders of this Practice are manifestly in an Error in their manner of Justifying it since they seem to bend the strength of their Replies against the Friendly Opposer and not against the furious Assaults made upon their Integrity tho' the last will appear the much easier Enemy to be overcome  This seems to be observ'd in the late Author of a Book Entituled  Moderation a Virtue  and I cannot but let that Gentleman know that from his Title the World expected an Answer to those Hot Gentlemen who rally the  Dissenters  with Hypocrisy and State Tricks in this Case while the principal Part of his Argument lies only against the stricter  Dissenter  as such tho' pointed at the  Churchman  lessening the Difference between them and the Church in order to make  Conformity  seem a thing of less Moment than it is forgetting that the less the Difference is the less the Reasons for a Schismatical Separation will appear and the Grounds and Reasons by which their Dissenting is to be defended appear the less justifiable  Of seven Heads of his Arguments I am therefore ready to leave the last four for some body else to answer and only observe a little on the first Three what the Arguments amount to which Vindicate the  Occasional Communion of a Dissenter  as in its self Lawful  And first as to his Precedents he is pleas'd to prove that  this  Occasional Conformity  is no new thing but has the Warrants of uncontestable Precedents    Nor indeed is his Argument new any more than the  Communion  but what has been before started and lately very happily answer'd But as this Author is far from being unworthy an Answer so as he writes both strenuously and yet modestly he deserves an Answer of Respect  I have already noted a very honest Concession granted by this Author  that he does not justify such as Conform meerly for a Place but owns it as a scandalous Practice    This is granting all the real Ground of the Dispute For as strictly speaking it may be possible that a Man may really Conform Occasionally to the Church without offence to his Conscience yet to run it up to the Extreamest Nicety and avoid the real Offence taken at the Practice is waving the Argument and falling upon another never proposed  Before therefore we come to the Argument I must observe that a Man may do a thing without Offence to his Conscience which may be really Sinful and his Conscience not being duly inform'd does not make the thing Lawful in Practice what ever it may be to him  But as the first Occasion of this Dispute was chiefly bent at such who really Conform to qualify themselves for State Employments it remains to Examine whether these Gentlemen charg'd have really done so or no and since naming of Names is very improper and not absolutely necessary in this Case I shall only lay down one Case in which I think without Breach of Charity a Man may be allow'd to guess that a Conforming is meerly for the Qualification  When a Man who is a profest  Dissenter  join'd in Communion with a separate Congregation and either never or not for a long time did Communicate with the Church but upon some prospect of Preferment some Election Place Profit or Perquisit shall Conform to the Church of a sudden and so very remarkably as to time  viz the Eve of an Election or the like  that all Men must guess at the reason of doing it and after this the Person never to Conform again but upon like Occasion  Shall any Man be judg'd for believing such a Man Conforms for the Place shall this be call'd the  Moderate Conscientious Dissenter  who this Character will distinguish from others let them find out among his Neighbours who know him I shall go no farther  To justify this Conformity much time has been spent and labour lost for I must account it lost and this Author has granted me the Clause which is a Token of his Honesty for really it is not to be defended But here seems to lye an opportunity now to cover this scandalous Practice with the pretence of Conscience and 'tis but being a little wary as to Circumstances and we may all for the future be Conscientious  Occasional Conformists  and  Conscientious Dissenters  both together  And to make way for this Endeavours are us'd first to prove the general Practice Lawful I confess the particular practice above nam'd was always the principal Design but since it is come so far as that one must be defended or  at least conceal'd by the other  I shall endeavour to show this covering will be too short for the Bed and the Shame and Nakedness will appear and as the particular Conformity we are upon is fairly supprest I shall Enquire if the General will hold water by it self And first for Precedents I cannot but wonder at  those which our Author present us with  John  the  Baptist  and our Saviour  John  the  Baptist  says he was an Occasional Conformist to the  Jewish  Church he went to  Jerusalem  thrice a Year to Worship but held seperate Assemblies in the Wilderness and Taught and Baptiz'd  'Tis plain  John  the  Baptist  was no  Dissenter  at all he was  a Preacher of Righteousness  and the  Jews  approv'd him  for all Men held him for a Prophet  but held all the Parts of the Establish'd Worship entire he Preach'd in the Wilderness but what did he say  Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand  He neither Dissented from the  Jewish  Worship nor taught others to do so but as a Forerunner who went to prepare the way told them the Gospel the  Messiah  and Saviour was at hand the finishing of the old Worship was at the Door and the Son of God coming to Erect his Kingdom in the World What was all this to Dissenting He preach'd neither aagainst their Doctrine nor Ceremonies he Conform'd to them all himself only such as would receive his Baptism  which was only a Token of their Faith in the Blessed Tidings he brought them  receiv'd it but they were not taught in the least to Dissent from the  Establish'd Worship    With what reason can it be concluded from hence that Christianity had its Rise in  Occasional Conformity  the Conclusion of this Argument savours of more Levity than this Author any where else discovers and seems a little too much a Sophism for a Man of his Judgment to offer in reasoning upon a Subject so serious  Our Lord Jesus Christ  says he  the Author of our Holy Religion was also an  Occasional Conformist God forbid I should dare to write so Our Lord was a strict compleat  Conformist  to the Ceremonial Institution in every part of it that was Divine but abhor'd the Innovations  of the  Jews  And he continued Conforming even to the last Passover which he Eat with his Disciples and not only was so himself but he instructed his Disciples in the like  They sit in  Moses  Seat whatsoever therefore they bid ye do that do ye Think not I am come to Destroy the Law I am not come to Destroy the Law but to fulfil  'Tis true our blessed Lord did preach against the Innovations which the Traditions of the  Elders  and the several divided Sects had brought into their Religion he reproach'd them with making his holy House of Prayer a Den of Thieves with teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of Men and the like but this was no more Dissenting from the Legal Institution which was the Establish'd Worship than the Prophet  Elijah  's overturning the Altars of  Baal  and slaying their Priests was a Dissenting for if purging the Church from Idols be Dissenting such it was our Saviour taught but all his Teachings were full of Expositions of the Law and Comments upon the Prophets and quoting them where they led unto himself Nor did he omit the Worship of their Temple and Synagogues tho' he took all other Opportunities indeed to teach the People in all places but he submitted to Circumcision Eat the Passover at the Appointed time and his Mother perform'd her proper Offerings of Purification  At the Death of our Lord he pronounc'd the great Work of Redemption finish'd the Law was thence resolv'd into the Gospel the Veil of the Temple rent in twain and the  Levitical  Institution began to cease I do not say entirely ceased  Our blessed Lord having Offer'd up himself a Sacrifice Once for all the Apostles never were found seeking to any Propitiation but that of Faith in his Blood  But in the Interval between the Establishing Christianity and the entire Dissolution of the  Jewish  Rites as a Religion the Apostles as  Jews  born are found in a promiscuous Occasional Exercise of both but what is to be gather'd from it only this That it remains to Examine whether the Law expir'd at once or by Gradations If it Expir'd at once when that Time was if Gradually when it arriv'd to a total Demise  If the  Levitical  Institution expir'd at once and that point of Time was when our Lord said  It is Finished  then it is as Lawful to Conform to the  Jewish  Worship on Occasion now as it was then  If not at this Time but Gradually then the first Institution being all of Divine Original and  One  only a shadow of the  Other  the Gospel being the thing Typified and the Law the Type it was neither a Dissent nor a Conforming for the  Jews  to Exercise religious Worship in either because the Religion was but the same thing and the Ceremonies of the New were not yet Settl'd But I do not say so of the Christians who were  Gentiles    But our Author who has said all this comes off again with this Caution  I am not concern'd to prove the Case of our Dissenters to be Parallel with these but it appears that Occasional Communion may in some Cases be Lawful    But in my Opinion if our Case is not Parallel any one might be allow'd to Ask What's this to us If the Cases are not alike the Arguments are not alike  I cannot think 'tis just to infer That because  Occasional Conformity  may in some Cases be Lawful therefore 'tis Lawful in our Case unless our Case and those  some Cases  agree For if so then 'tis as Lawful for us Occasionally to Conform to the  Romish  Church or to  the  Jewish  Church For by our Author's Argument a Christian has nothing to do but to Examine whether he thinks it Lawful in his Case or no  But not one Man has yet attempted to Explain this Question  How the Dissenting can be Justified when we can so easily Conform  The making a Breach in the Establish'd Church a Schism in the General Union The Breaking off from a General Communion The Erecting private Churches a seperate Discipline and all this for Things which Occasionally we can Comply with  If any  Occasion  can justify a  Conformity  no  Occasion  can be of greater moment than Peace Union Charity Order Obedience to Princes Laws and the like If we have not thought these sufficient Occasions Let us see which are Greater  But after all pray let us Examine this Great Article of Conformity in the Apostles and I am of Opinion it shall come out fairly that really the Apostles were not Occasional Conformists at all  And first in General I Affirm none of the Apostles are ever found Conforming to any thing which they had declar'd their dissent from before but let us Examine wherein they did actually Conform and why  If any Man will but give himself leave to Distinguish a little in the Case he may arrive at the Truth of this Matter with a small difficulty He need only distinguish between the Practice of the Apostles as  Jews  born under the Obligation of the  Levitical  Law and continuing still under more Obligations than Christian Proselytes and observe that as Jews they found themselves under some Legal Duties which the Gentile Christians were absolutely Free from And therefore all that we call  Occasional Conformity  was only doing what they were bound in Conscience to do and had never Dissented from  The Circumcising of  Timothy  and the several Parts of the Law St  Paul  Conform'd to were nothing but what  as Jews  they were obliged to and their Faith in the Saviour did not at all take off the Obligation from those who were  Hebrews  born and were then alive they were still  Zealous of the Law Acts  and the Obligation  to be so  continued to them For this Reason the Circumcision of  Timothy  is justified because his Mother and Grandmother were  Hebrews  whereas it is expresly said St  Paul  refus'd to Circumcise  Titus  because his Father was a  Greek    By this it appears that Circumcision was Administred in  Timothy  not as an Occasional Conformity but as a Duty and a Thing which  Timothy  as a Son of  Jewish  Parents ought to do and it rather seems strange it was not done before  To Prove this see what is in the same Case said to the Christians who were  Gentiles  by Birth even the same Apostle says  If they were Circumcised Christ should profit them nothing    The Matter therefore rested upon such a Conformity as was requir'd of them as  Jews  and which the Death of Christ could not Dissolve the Obligation of to them who were then alive because the Force of them began in their being Born of the Stock of  Abraham    But if the Opponent in this Matter can show me one Instance in the whole Scripture of any Christian whether Apostle or Elder who being born a  Gentile  did by this Authority Conform to the  Jewish  Ceremonies even in the least Article then I'll throw up this Point and if not then I should be glad to meet with the same Candor either to have my Argument Answer'd or Granted  This Matter will further appear if any Man will but take the pains to Examine the Scriptures in the Case The History of the Apostles coming to  Jerusalem  seems to me to make it plain in the  st  of the  Acts v  the Brethren come to St  Paul  and tell him That the Multitude of Converted  Hebrews  had Entertain'd a Scandal at his Conversation from Reports rais'd upon him  That he taught the  Jews  to forsake  Moses's  Law    Now it appears that this was really a false Report by the care taken to Convince the  Jewish  Believers of it Verse the  Do therefore this that we say unto thee We have four Men which have a Vow on them them take and Purify thy self with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their Heads    It remains to Enquire what was all this for It was not as is pretended a Conforming on Occasion to prevent giving Offence but it was a Practising that which was still Lawful that the scandalous Report might be Confuted and the next Words make it out  viz That all may know that those Things whereof they are Informed concerning thee are nothing  that is that 'tis all false and scandalous and that those  Jews  who Believed were still to walk orderly and to keep the Law  That therefore the Christians who were Converted from the  Jews  were thus obliged to keep the Law is plain and 'tis clear the keeping the Law could be no Sin because of its Divine Original  But let us look to the  Gentiles  and let  them  show me one Act of Occasional Conformity among them Verse the th  as concerning the Gentiles who believe  we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing  and at the same time that the Apostle Circumcised  Timothy  because his Mother was a  Hebrew  as is Noted before he refus'd to Circumcise  Titus  because his Parents were  Greeks  having said of the  Gentiles That if they are Circumcised Christ shall be to them of no effect    Thus I think this mighty Difficulty is over the Occasional Conformity of the Apostles at an end and the Uniformity of the Christian Church in its first Institution Vindicated  Our Commentators say God indulg'd the  Jews  the liberty of Using or not Using the  Ceremoniale  of the Law as a thing wholly Indifferent and as what upon the general Revolution which Religion came under at the Death of our Lord was necessary to Reconcile the  Jews  to the Change  Others are of Opinion it was a Burthen on the  Jewish  Believers which the  Gentiles  were freed from but they oblig'd to  And this seems plain from  Acts    It seem'd good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater Burthen than this that ye abstain from meats offer'd to Idols and from Blood  This was to the  Gentiles  but the keeping of the Law  was a Burthen  yet lest on the  Jews  who were turn'd Christians and then in being  But be which of these Opinions  we will  in the Right both allow that it only respected the  Jews  and them no further than those then alive and that the  Gentile  Converts were not allow'd the least Shaddow of a Compliance or Occasional Conformity No not to the least and most Indifferent Ceremony And tho' the Connexion between  Circumcision  and  Baptism  was plain and they were equally Seals of the Covenant yet for a  Gentile  Christian to have accepted Circumcision had been to make the Death of Christ of no effect to him  And indeed as the Death of Christ had a positive Effect upon the Law to Abrogate and Disannul it the  Jews  then in being might be under Vows and Orders which their Embracing the Faith of Christ did not Destroy but if after the Death of Christ any Christian who was not a  Jew  born might on occasion Conform to the old Law of  Moses  it can never be Answer'd why it is less Lawful now  The Inference therefore drawn by the Author  p  that by this it appears Occasional Communion in some Case may be Lawful where Constant Communion would be a Sin cannot be true that is it cannot be true from those Premises because the Fact of those Premises does not appear to be true either that  John  the Baptist our Lord Jesus Christ or any of the Apostles were Occasional Conformists  As to the Sacrifices and Supplications offered up at the Temple for foreign Princes or Heathen Emperors and Powers first I am not Satisfied that it was not an Innovation or Tradition many of which crept into the  Jewish  Worship till they became of equal Authority to the Law it self  But if it were true it seems no more an Instance of Occasional Conformity than it would be in the Dissenters of  England  on a formal Request from the Emperor of  Germany  or the Pope to keep a solemn Fast to Pray for them this might be Occasional Conformity in the Emperor to us but not in us to him It was a publick Acknowledgment in the  Romans  and a Testimony to the Verity of the  Jews  Religion but it was no Conforming to the  Romans  in offering Sacrifices to  God for the Welfare of their Emperors and I cannot but admire for what use in this Argument this Case is brought being in my humble Opinion nothing at all to the Matter  From hence I must lay down That Occasional Conformity is not sufficiently prov'd by Precedents and Authorities of Scripture  Our Author's second Head is to prove  That the Principles of the conscientious Occasional Conformist are  Christian  and  Catholick  and will Justify him before God and Man    This Argument I think lies a little unfair for the Man is not rightly describ'd who is this conscientious Occasional Conformist  The Question before me seems to lye thus Whether a Thing that would otherwise be Unlawful is Justifiable because the Person acting it is not Reprov'd in it by his Conscience  The Man is brought in with Extraordinary Qualifications  "Not of a Mercenary Spirit or Sinister Intention to the Establish'd Church He believes it a True Church Owns her Ministry Acknowledges her Liturgy to be sound for Substance"  "But because he conceives the Dissenting Churches to be True Churches and their Ministers generally Men of real Piety he thinks himself oblig'd to hold Communion with them"  Now where shall we find this Man This is not the Dissenter we are upon  With Submission this Man never was a Dissenter he who in his Conscience believes all the abovesaid of the Church of  England  and has no more to say why he Dissents may very well justify Conforming to the Church but I am sure he can  never justify Dissenting from them Shall we make a Schism in the Establish'd Church only because we believe the Dissenting Churches to be True Churches and their Ministers good Men This will never Justify us  But our Author goes one  p  to Enumerate the Things for which the Dissenter quits the Church Communion as  A Defective Discipline  A Promiscuous Communion contrary to the Rules of the Gospel and the Primitive Practice of the Church  An Impos'd Liturgy to an entire Loss of the Gift of Prayer  Human Mixtures in the Ministration as the Cross Surplice  c  The Obligation on a Christian to seek the best Guides for his Soul  This is a Satyr upon the Church of  England  and the True and Real Grounds of a Dissenter's Separation and he that Dissents on these Grounds can never Conform upon Occasion if he does how he can at the same time Justify his Dissenting remains with me a Question yet unanswer'd  All the Instances brought from Dr  Bates  Mr  Baxter  Mr  Corbett  Mr  Tallents  have some particular Exceptions at first the great Dispute in their Cases is between Lay Conformity and Conformity as ClergyMen as Laymen they could Conform as Clergymen they could not and preach'd in seperate Churches only  because the Church having shut the Door against them they thought themselves oblig'd as they were Lawful ordain'd Ministers not to desist from the Work of their Office though Man had impos'd some Things on them which they could not comply with but that they were under an indispensible Necessity to preach the Gospel and to Exercise their Duty tho' they were silenc'd by the Law  I think the third Head is something of Kin to the second for this is to show that  the Difference between the Church of  England  and the  Dissenter  is but little    I solemnly Appeal to the Searcher of all Hearts that I am none of those who are for making the Difference greater than it really is  And with the same Sincerity I protest I wish it was not so great as it is and heartily wish I could Conform wholly to the Church  And I wish the Church to try the Sincerity of the  Dissenters  would come to a Temper abate us what without Prejudice to Doctrine or Discipline might be abated and condescend so far to the Tender Consciences of us their weaker Brethren that all the  Dissenters  of a Catholick Spirit might come in and join with them  But as I would not make the Difference wider so I cannot make it less I cannot bring my Dissenting Reasons to such Punctilio's and reduce them all to Trifles without reproaching my self with a needless and unchristian Separation For I cannot but say God forbid I should be found making or keeping up a Breach in the Christian Union and Charity of the Church for little Matters and divide in Communion for Trifles  Our Author says we Agree in all the Essentials of Christianity and differ only in Accidentals and  the great things in which we agree should be more powerful to unite us than the lesser in which we differ should be to divide    I cannot think I do the Author Injustice if I say if this be true no Man can justify Dissenting from the Church and if it be any thing but a strong Argument for a constant Conformity then I am at a loss to understand plain  English    We agree in all the great Things and differ only in Small the great Things in which we agree ought to be more powerful to make us Conform than the small Things should be to make us Dissent that is we ought to Conform  If this be true why do we not Conform How can we justify our Dissenting  They agree and none of them scruple a Moderate Episcopacy  says our Author  This I refer to the whole Church of  Scotland  who are all  Presbyterians  and have suffer'd as much for a Dissenting from Prelacy as ever the Church of  England  did for Dissenting from  Popery  If the  English Dissenters  do not scruple Episcopacy then I confess I am at a Loss to know why we dissent  But then we are led to this Argument by the word  Moderate Dissenter  and  Moderate Episcopacy  either this  Moderate Dissenter  is no  Dissenter  or this  Moderate Episcopacy  is no  Episcopacy  Indeed the Churchmen do look on Archbishop  Usher  's Model to be no  Episcopacy  at all  They agree in their Publick Worship their Prayers and Praises are for Substance the same  says this Author  Witness say I their Cathedral Worship their Choristers Musick Singing their Prayers their Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions Chapters Dignities Vestments Bowings to the Altar and at the Name of Jesus their Responses Anthems Exorcisms and a numberless variety of things the  Dissenter  has no concern about in his Worship  I wonder any Gentleman of so much Learning and Candor can say our Praises and Prayers are the same for Substance  Nay even this very Author employs very good Reasons for our not complying with the Liturgy nor thinking it Lawful to impose Forms upon the Ministry and tye them up to them  The Difference about Ordination of Ministers which this Author is pleas'd to say is inconsiderable is the next and I cannot agree that this is a small Difference and all he says on this Head seems to me to be a good Reason why the Church should agree to allow an Ordination by  Presbyters  but no reason to satisfy the  Dissenter  with Episcopal Ordination  I believe there are five Reasons to be given why the Church of  England  should allow and accept of an Ordination by  Presbyters  to one why the  Dissenter  should submit to Episcopal Ordination  And if it be only this One 'tis a great One which even our Author has Quoted  viz  that Ordination by  Presbyters  without the  Diocesan  is own'd by the Church of  England  to be  Orthodox  in that great Act of Parliament by which the Reformation was Establish'd in  England  in Queen  Elizabeth  's time  Eliz Cap    What has been since has been Impos'd by the Craft and for the private designs of  States Men  in the Church whose designs have been not to have the  Dissenters Conform  but to keep them rather the farther from  Conforming    As to the rest of this Book I leave the  ChurchMen  to Answer it if they can  As about the multitude of Broils Parties and Contentions the Church has within her self how Inconsistent with her own Canon and prescrib'd Rules many of her Members act these are most True and all the rest of his Heads I readily Grant as his fourth Head  That employing  Dissenters  is so far from weakening that it strengthens the Church    This he may more easily persuade me to believe than he will the Churchmen  of the high Party  who rail at it  Fifth  That  Occasional Conformity  is an Advantage to the Church and weakens the  Dissenters The latter I believe and therefore would not have the  Dissenter  be concern'd in it and wonder if the Author believes so how he that is a  Dissenter  can argue for the Practice  the  Dissenters  ought to thank him for it    I doubt not but this Occasional Conforming of the  Dissenters  in this Age is a Prologue to a total  Conformity  in the next and leads our Posterity to quit that Dissenting wholly which they saw their Fathers could quit as they found Occasion and I desire him in his next to tell us what Advantage it is any way to the  Dissenters    Sixth  That the late Bill against  Occasional Conformity  would have been highly Prejudicial to the Church    I believe so and to the  Dissenters  too and therefore the Lords dismist it as not proper by any means to pass into a Law  His last Argument that  Dissenters  from National Establish'd Churches have always been Employ'd by most Nations and Governments I grant and he has effectually made it appear  But all this leaves the matter where we found it  That Conforming to the Church of  England  as it has been lately Practis'd by the  Dissenters  for the qualifying themselves for Places and Employments in the Government is a Practice unwarrantable from the Scripture Pernicious to the  Dissenters  themselves and will be fatal both to their Reputation and Interest  And tho' really  Occasional Communion  does not seem Clear to me on any score whatever  Yet this is out of doubt and the Author I have been naming readily grants it me That tho'  Occasional Conformity  Abstracted might be justify'd yet this is no justifiable Occasion  Since then the Dispute will end as to this Occasion those who are willing to be concern'd in any further Debate of it would do well to lay down what Occasions are sufficient to justifie Conforming to the Church and what Circumstances are required to such an Occasion that the honest Conscientious  Occasional Conformist  if such a Man can be may be distinguish'd from the  Hypocrite  and the whole Party may not bear the Reproach  And because this Point has never been yielded before I cannot dismiss it without some Remarks  which I judge Natural from the Premises and Necessary to the Circumstance  As first 'tis apparent many of the Dissenters who have thus Conform'd have never in the whole Course of their Lives Conform'd before no not when Persecuted by the Church of  England  have suffer'd Imprisonment Confiscation of Goods and several other publick Oppressions and never would Conform But when Invited to Places of Honour or Profit have Complied thinking the Obtaining a good Place a sufficient Occasion to Invite them when neither the Laws nor the Persecution it self could be thought an Occasion to Compel  Now  if as is own'd  Moderation a Vertue  p  This be a Reproach to Religion and Offensive to all good Christians  then they ought to avoid the Practice or to Regulate it so as that it may not appear to be done meerly as a Qualification  Another Remark I cannot but make That if  Occasional Conformity  be Lawful then it cannot be True as too many have said That this Dispute will bring Persecution upon the Dissenters  For 'tis no Breach of Charity to say none of those Gentlemen who can Voluntarily Conform will ever suffer Persecution for not Conforming and this Confirms the ill Actings of those who did suffer before and Conform'd afterwards For 'tis plain by their Suffering their Consciences were against it before and 'tis as plain by their Complying that the Advantage smother'd the Scruple  A Man can by no possible Arguing justifie suffering persecution for that which he can with a satisfied Conscience comply with If thereforo a hot Persecution should come on the  Dissenters  which God forbid  Occasional Communion  secures all those who can comply For if to avoid Persecution be not a justifiable occasion I know very few occasions which can be justified  And 'tis for this Reason I would entreat those Gentlemen to let us know what are justifiable Occasions and what are not  Now as our Author has furnish'd us out of History with a great many excellent Precedents for the employing  Dissenters  both in the Governments and Armies of those Nations where they dwelt  I wish with all my Heart he had pleas'd to Examine History for all those glorious Instances of the Confessors and Martyrs of all Ages who have sacrificed their Lives even for the rejecting the most Minute Articles of Conformity upon the most pressing and extraordinary Occasions  I shall rather recommend my Reader to the Histories where such Instances are to be found than trouble him with a long Transcription of the Particulars  Let them who are curious in this Search Examine the Martyrologies of the Church from its first Institution and first let him but view the young  Maccabees  and their wonderful Mother and when the Tortures they endur'd are consider'd let them also consider what was the Occasion only refusing to eat a Bit of Swines Flesh nay they would have excus'd them if they would but have suffer'd them to put it into their Mouths by  force which they would not endure but as soon as it was attempted spit it out in the very Faces of their Tormentors and died rather than be guilty of  Occasional Conformity    Let such Men remember  Origen  who having been guilty of  Occasional Conformity  only in the most passive manner he possibly could as but suffering the Heathen Priest to put a little Frankincense into his Hand and dropping it into the Fire not so much as owning it to be a Sacrifice much less owning the Idol to be a God and see his Repentance how many Years was he left in the Agonies of Despair and how does he bemoan himself on that account calling himself Apostate from Christ and unworthy of Martyrdom  The Primitive History of the Church gives us innumerable Instances of the Constancy and Exactness of the Christians in this Point  And I only forbear to enumerate them because they are to be found in the first Vol of  Fox  's Acts and Monuments of the Church in  Eusebius  and in all the Historians of those Times  But it may be answer'd That this was a Conformity to what was absolutely unlawful Idolatrous and abominable which is not to be alledged here  To this I rejoin he that Dissents from the Church of  England  does it because he cannot in Conscience Comply or else he can have no justifiable Reason for Dissenting Now all things are unlawful to him which his Conscience is not satisfied about and tho' not equally abominable are so much so as that no Man can comply with them safely But to obviate the Objection  wholly we will come nearer to the present Case  The Church of  England  to her Glory be it spoken is founded in the numerous throng of blessed Martyrs and Confessors who have left their Memory and Example as a lasting Testimony against  Occasional Conformity  even in the small and some of them indifferent things  Blessed Bishop  Hooper  when he came to the Stake to seal with his Blood the Testimony of his Faith and when in the last Agonies of his Life the Queens Pardon was offer'd upon Terms very much short of a total Conformity only to set his Hand to an acknowledgement cried out before it was read  If you Love my Soul away with it    Let us now look abroad in Times more Modern and within our Memory and what are all the new Converts as they are call'd in  France  but  Occasional Conformist    The Fire of Persecution having burnt up the Protestant Church all those who could not stand the brunt not make their escape or such whose Religion had not force enough with them to make them suffer the loss of all what did they do they fly to this very refuge  Occasional Conformity  and if the Arguments are Examin'd they are much the same with Ours  The Protestants do not deny but 'tis possible to be sav'd in the  Roman  Church and they may upon occasion therefore Conform in some things while at the same time they reserve their Minds and Hearts entirely to the true Worship and  Naaman  the  Syrian  say they was such an  Occasional Conformist  to whom the Prophet gave a tacit Licence when upon the proposal he reply'd  Go in Peace    Here is the only Instance of  Occasional Conformity  which exactly reaches our Case that I remember and I see nothing can be said to justifie Ours which may not justify Theirs only that indeed the difference is not so great between  Protestant  and  Protestant  as between  Protestant  and  Roman Catholick    But if the difference here be great enough to justifie a Dissenting for Conscience sake the Argument is the same  The Case of kneeling in the Street when the  Roman  Processions come by is as parallel to our Impos'd Ceremonies as any thing in two different Religions can be and yet thus they Occasionally Conform and please themselves with fancying that they do not do it as an Act of Worship But our  Martyrs  in Queen  Mary's  time frequently Sacrific'd their Blood on more minute Circumstances than that as not suffering a Child to be Baptiz'd tho' by Force in the Case of Mr  Glover  Mrs  Lane John Field  throwing down the Rood of  Dover  Court and the like  Now let any Man Examine the  Occasional Conformity  of the  Hugonots  in  France  and tell me if the Consequence is not very probable to be this that one Age may make all their posterity  Roman Catholicks Vice Versa    And what is the Opinion their Brethren who are in Banishment have of them  Come les Persons qu on Avez Vendue leur Religion  as Persons that have sold their Religion People who have Tainted their Principles and testify'd that they cannot part with their Estates to preserve their Consciences  They are still Protestants on their Inclination and they please themselves that this  Conformity  is justify'd by the occasion of it and let them that like it follow their Example  I am not concern'd here to prove that the Church of  Rome  is no true Church that  Popery  is  Idolatry  and that the Cases therefore do not agree The Dissenting in both Cases is for Conscience sake and therein the Cases are Parallel We were once all of the  Roman  Church and had never remov'd from thence but from Scruples of Conscience and we are now Dissenters from the Church of  England  from scruple of Conscience We own the Church of  England  to be a true Church and we do not deny Salvation to the Members of the  Roman  there are things in the Church of  England  we cannot comply with and there are some things in the Church of  Rome  which we could comply with but there are things in both we Dissent from and  Occasional Conformity  to those very things can be justified from very few reasons on one side which will not hold good on the other  This in short then is the plain Conclusion of this Matter  Occasional Conformity  to a Church from which we have separated and in those things for which we seperated  viz  Communion does not appear to be lawful or justifiable in a  Dissenter  nor are there any Precedents for it in the Scripture  But  Occasional Conformity  being practis'd as a Qualification for Civil Employments is a Reproach to Religion and scandalous to the  Dissenters    The last is fairly acknowledg'd by the Author of  Moderation a Vertue  and I think the first is made plain in these Sheets  Of the whole Argument then this is the sum  Those  Dissenters  who are yet of the Opinion it is not unlawful in it self should take care to practise it so as that those Circumstances of Qualification may not be suspected  They should state what are sufficient Occasions to justifye our Conforming to what at other times we have Dissented from and give us Scripture Authorities to prove them  They ought to let us see how they can justifye Dissenting at all if they can defend Conforming again  They ought to prove that the Conformity or  Occasional Conformity  as they call it of Christ and the Apostles was to such things as were meerly of Mans' Appointment or purely to such as were Divine or whether they Conform'd to any thing they Dissented from before  But till some of these Points are settled I cannot but think the whole practice of it a Scandal to the  Dissenters  ruinous to their Interest and tends to the reducing them all or their Posterity at least to an absolute total Conformity or at best a general Indifferency in Matters of Religion  FINIS
