Reverend Mr  Edward Young  A GENERAL VIEW of the EPIC POEM And of the  ILIAD  and  ODYSSEY  Extracted from  BOSSU  SECT I  Of the Nature of Epic Poetry  _THE Fables of Poets were originally employ'd in representing the  Divine Nature  according to the notion then conceiv'd of it This sublime Subject occasion'd the first Poets to be call'd Divines and Poetry  the Language of the Gods  They divided the divine Attributes into so many Persons because the infirmity of a human Mind cannot sufficiently conceive or explain so much Power and Action in a Simplicity so great and indivisible as that of God And perhaps they were also jealous of the advantages they reap'd from such excellent and exalted learning and of which they thought the vulgar part of mankind was not worthy  They could not describe the Operations of this Almighty Cause without speaking at the same time of its Effects so that to Divinity they added  Physiology  and treated of both without quitting the umbrages of their Allegorical Expressions  But  Man  being the chief and the most noble of all that God produc'd and nothing being so proper or more useful to Poets than this Subject they added it to the former and treated of the doctrine of  Morality  after the same manner as they did that of Divinity and Philosophy And from Morality thus treated is form'd that kind of Poem and Fable which we call  Epic  The Poets did the same in Morality that the Divines had done in Divinity But that infinite variety of the actions and operations of the Divine Nature to which our understanding bears so small a proportion did as it were force them upon dividing the single Idea of the Only One God into several Persons under the different names of  Jupiter    Juno    Neptune  and the rest  And on the other hand the nature of Moral Philosophy being such as never to treat of things in particular but in general the Epic Poets were oblig'd to unite in one single Idea in one and the same Person and in an Action which appear'd singular all that look'd like it in different persons and in various actions which might be thus contain'd as so many  Species  under their  Genus  The Presence of the Deity and the Care such an august Cause is to be suppos'd to take about any action obliges the Poet to represent this action as great important and manag'd by  Res gestae regumque ducumque  Hor Art Poet  Kings and Princes It obliges him likewise to think and speak in an elevated way above the vulgar and in a style that may in some fort keep up the character of the Divine Persons he introduces  Cui mens divinior atque os Magna sonaturum des Nominis hujus honorem  Horat  To this end serve the poetical and figurative Expression and the Majesty of the Heroick Verse  But all this being divine and surprising may quite ruin all Probability Therefore the Poet should take a peculiar care as to that point since his chief aim is to instruct and without Probability any action is less likely to persuade  Lastly since Precepts ought to be  Quicquid praecipies esto brevis ut citò dicta Percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles  Hor Poet  concise to be the more easily conceiv'd and less oppress the memory and since nothing can be more effectual to this end than proposing one single Idea and collecting all things so well together as to be present to our minds all at once therefore the Poets have reduc'd all to one  Denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat unum  bid  single action under one and the same design and in a body whose members and parts should be homogeneous  What we have observ'd of the nature of the Epic Poem gives us a just Idea of it and we may define it thus  "The Epic Poem is a discourse invented by art to form the Manners by such instructions as are disguis'd under the allegories of some One important Action which is related in verse after a probable diverting and surprizing manner"  SECT II  The Fable of the  Iliad  IN every design which a man deliberately undertakes the end he proposes is the first thing in his mind and that by which he governs the whole work and all its parts Thus since the End of the Epic Poem is to regulate the Manners 'tis with this first view the Poet ought to begin  But there is a great difference between the Philosophical and the Poetical doctrine of Manners The Schoolmen content themselves with treating of Virtues and Vices in general the instructions they give are proper for all States People and for all Ages But the Poet has a nearer regard to his own Country and the necessities of his own nation With this design he makes choice of some piece of morality the most proper and just he can imagin And in order to press this home he makes less use of the force of Reasoning than of the power of Insinuation accommodating himself to the particular customs and inclinations of those who are to be the subject or the readers of his work  Let us now see how  Homer  has acquitted himself in all these respects  He saw the  Grecians  for whom he design'd his Poem were divided into as many States as they had capital Cities Each was  a Body Politick apart and had its form of government independent from all the rest And yet these distinct States were very often oblig'd to unite together in one body against their common Enemies These were two very different sorts of Government such as could not be comprehended in one maxim of morality and in one single Poem  The Poet therefore has made two distinct Fables of them The one is for  Greece  in general united into one body but compos'd of parts independent on each other and the other for each particular state consider'd as they were in time of peace without the former circumstances and the necessity of being united  As for the first sort of government in the Union or rather in the Confederacy of many independent States experience has always made it appear  "That nothing so much causes success as a due subordination and a right understanding among the chief commanders And on the other hand the inevitable ruin of such confederacies proceeds from the heats jealousies and ambition of the differerent leaders and the discontents of submitting to a single General"  All sorts of States and in particular the  Grecians  had dearly experienc'd this truth So that the most useful and necessary instruction that could be given them was to lay before their eyes the loss which both the People and the Princes must of necessity suffer by the ambition discord and obstinacy of the latter  Homer  then has taken for the foundation of his Fable this great Truth That a Misunderstanding between Princes is the Ruin of their own States  "I sing says he the Anger of  Achilles  so pernicious to the  Grecians  and the cause of so many Heroe's deaths occasion'd by the Discord and Separation of  Agamemnon  and that Prince"  But that this truth may be compleatly and fully known there is need of a second to support it 'Tis necessary in such a design not only to represent the Confederate States at first disagreeing among themselves and from thence unfortunate but to show the same States afterwards reconciled and united and of consequence victorious  Let us now see how he has joyn'd all these in one general action  "Several Princes independent on one another were united against a common enemy The person whom they had elected their General offers an affront to the most valiant of all the Confederates This offended Prince is so far provoked as to relinquish the Union and obstinately refuse to fight for the common cause This Misunderstanding gives the enemy such an advantage that the Allies are very near quitting their design with dishonour He himself who made the separation is not exempt from sharing the misfortune which he brought upon his party For having permitted his intimate friend to succour them in a great necessity this friend is kill'd by the enemy's General Thus the contending Princes being both made wiser at their own cost are reconcil'd and unite again Then this valiant Prince not only obtains the victory in the publick cause but revenges his private wrongs by killing with his own hands the author of the death of his friend"  This is the first Platform of the Poem and the Fiction which reduces into one important and universal Action all the particulars upon which it turns  In the next place it must be render'd Probable by the circumstances of times places and persons Some persons must be found out already known by History or otherwise whom we may with Probability make the actors and personages of this Fable  Homer  has made choice of the siege of  Troy  and feign'd that this action happen'd there To a Phantome of his brain whom he would paint valiant and cholerick he has given the name of  Achilles  that of  Agamemnon  to his General that of  Hector  to the Enemies Commander and so to the rest  Besides he was oblig'd to accommodate himself to the manners customs and genius of the  Greeks  his Auditors the better to make them attend to the instruction of his Poem and to gain their approbation by praising them So that they might the better forgive him the representation of their own faults in some of his  chief Personages He admirably discharges all these duties by making these brave Princes and those victorious people all  Grecians  and the fathers of those he had a mind to commend  But not being content in a work of such a length to propose only the principal point of the Moral and to fill up the rest with useless ornaments and foreign incidents he extends this Moral by all its necessary consequences As for instance in the subject before us 'tis not enough to know that a good understanding ought always to be maintain'd among Confederates 'Tis likewise of equal importance that if there happens any division care must be taken to keep it secret from the enemy that their ignorance of this advantage may prevent their making use of it And in the second place when their concord is but counterfeit and only in appearance one should never press the enemy too closely for this would discover the weakness which we ought to conceal from them  The Episode of  Patroclus  most admirably furnishes us with these two instructions For when he appear'd in the arms of  Achilles  the  Trojans  who took him for that Prince now reconciled and united to the Confederates immediately gave ground and quitted the advantages they had before over the  Greeks  But  Patroclus  who should have been contented with this success presses upon  Hector  too boldly and by obliging him to fight soon discovers that it was not the true  Achilles  who was clad in his armour but a Heroe of much inferior prowess So that  Hector  kills him and regains those advantages which the  Trojans  had lost on the opinion that  Achilles  was reconciled  SECT III  The Fable of the  Odyssey  THE  Odyssey  was not design'd like the  Iliad  for the instruction of all the States of  Greece  join'd in one body but for each State in particular As a State is compos'd of two parts the Head which commands and the Members which obey there are instructions requisite for both to teach the one to govern and the others to submit to Government  There are two Virtues necessary to one in authority Prudence to order and Care to see his orders put in execution The Prudence of a Politician is not acquir'd but by a long experience in all sorts of business and by an acquaintance with all the different forms of Governments and States The Care of the Administration suffers not him that has the Government to rely upon others but requires his own presence And Kings who are absent from their States are in danger of losing them and give occasion to great disorders and confusion  These two points may be easily united in one and the same man  * "A King forsakes his Kingdom to visit the courts of several Princes where he learns the manners and customs of different nations From hence there naturally arises a vast number of incidents of dangers and of adventures very useful for a Political Institution On the other side this Absence gives way to the disorders which happen in his own kingdom and which end not till his return whose presence only can reestablish all things"  Thus the Absence of a King has the same effects in this Fable as the Division of the Princes had in the former  The Subjects have scarce any need but of one general maxim which is To suffer themselves to be govern'd and to obey faithfully whatever reason they may imagine against the orders they receiv'd It is easy to join this instruction with the other by bestowing on this wise and industrious Prince such Subjects as in his absence would rather follow their own judgment than his commands and by demonstrating the misfortunes which this disobedience draws upon them the evil consequences which almost infallibly attend these particular notions which are entirely different from the general Idaea of him who ought to govern  But as it was necessary that the Princes in the  Iliad  shou'd be cholerick and quarrelsome so it is necessary in the Fable of the  Odyssey  that the chief person should be sage and prudent This raises a difficulty in the Fiction because this person ought to be absent for the two reasons aforemention'd which are essential to the Fable and which constitute the principal aim of it But  he cannot absent himself without offending against another maxim of equal importance  viz  That a King should upon no account leave his Country  It is true there are sometimes such necessities as sufficiently excuse the Prudence of a Politician in this point But such a necessity is a thing important enough of it self to supply matter for another Poem and this multiplication of the action would be vicious To prevent which in the first place this Necessity and the departure of the Hero must be disjoin'd from the Poem and in the second place the Hero having been oblig'd to absent himself for a reason antecedent to the action and plac'd distinct from the Fable he ought not so far to embrace this oppornity of instructing himself as to absent himself voluntarily from his own Government For at this rate his Absence would be meerly Voluntary and one might with reason lay to his charge all the disorders which might arrive  Thus in the constitution of the Fable he ought not to take for his action and for the foundation of his Poem the Departure of a Prince from his own country nor his voluntary stay in any other place but his Return and this return retarded against his will This is the first Idea  Homer  gives us of it  Odyss  His Hero appears at first in a desolate Island sitting upon the side of the Sea which with tears in his eyes he looks upon as the obstacle that had so long oppos'd his Return and detain'd him from revisiting his own dear Country  And lastly since this forc'd delay might more naturally and usually happen to such as make voyages by sea  Homer  has judiciously made choice of a Prince whose Kingdom was in an Island  Let us see then how he has feign'd all this Action making his Hero a person in years because Years are requisite to instruct a man in Prudence and Policy  "A Prince had been oblig'd to forsake his native Country and to head an Army of his Subjects in a foreign expedition Having gloriously perform'd this enterprise he was marching home again and conducting his Subjects to his own State  But spite of all the attempts with which his eagerness to return had inspir'd him he was stopp'd by the way by tempests for several years and cast upon several countries differing from each other in Manners and Government In these dangers his Companions not always following his orders perish'd through their own fault The Grandees of his country strangely abuse his absence and raise no small disorders at home They consume his estate conspire to destroy his son would constrain his Queen to accept of one of them for her Husband and indulge themselves in all violence so much the more because they were persuaded he would never return But at last he returns and discovering himself only to his son and some others who had continu'd firm to him he is an eyewitness of the insolence of his enemies punishes them according to their deserts and restores to his Island that tranquility and repose to which they had been strangers during his absence"  As the Truth which serves for foundation to this fiction is that the Absence of a person from his own home or his neglect of his own affairs is the cause of great disorders So the Principal point of the Action and the most Essential one is the Absence of the Heroe This fills almost all the Poem For not only this real absence lasted several years but even when the Heroe return'd he does not discover himself and this prudent disguise from whence he reap'd so much advantage has the same effect upon the Authors of the disorders and all others who knew him not as his real absence had before so that he is absent as to them 'till the very moment of their punishment  After the Poet had thus compos'd his Fable and join'd the Fiction to the Truth he then makes choice of  Ulysses  the King of the Isle of  Ithaca  to maintain the character of his chief Personage and bestow'd the rest upon  Telemachus    Penelope    Antinous  and others whom he calls by what names he pleases  I shall not here insist upon the many excellent advices which are so many parts and natural consequences of the fundamental  Truth and which the Poet very dextrously lays down in those fictions which are the Episodes and Members of the entire Action Such for instance are these advices Not to intrude one's self into the Mysteries of Government which the Prince keeps secret This is represented to us by the winds shut up in a bullhide which the miserable Companions of  Ulysses  would needs be so foolish as to pry into Not to suffer ones self to be led away by the seeming Charms of an idle and inactive life to which the  Sirens Songs  invited  Improba Siren desidia  Horat  Not to suffer ones self to be sensualiz'd by pleasures like those who were chang'd into brutes by  Circe  And a great many other points of Morality necessary for all sorts of people  This Poem is more useful to the People than the  Iliad  where the Subjects suffer rather by the ill conduct of their Princes than through their own miscarriages But in the  Odyssey  'tis not the fault of  Ulysses  that is the ruin of his Subjects This wise Prince leaves untry'd no method to make them partakers of the benefit of his return Thus the Poet in the  Iliad  says  "He sings the anger of  Achilles  which had caused the death of so many  Grecians  "  and on the contrary in the  Odyss  Odyssey  he tells his Readers  "That the Subjects perished through their own fault"  SECT IV  Of the Unity of the Fable  ARISTOTLE  bestows great Encomiums on  Homer  for the Simplicity of his design because he has included in one single part all that happen'd at the siege of  Troy  And to this he opposes the ignorance of some Poets who imagin'd that the Unity of the Fable or Action was sufficiently preserved by the Unity of the Heroe and who compos'd their  Theseids    Heracleids  and the like wherein they only heap'd up in one Poem every thing that happen'd to one Personage  He finds fault with those Poets who were for reducing the Unity of the  Fable  into the Unity of the  Heroe  because one man may have performed several adventures which 'tis impossible to  reduce under any one and simple head This reducing of all things to Unity and Simplicity is what  Horace  likewise makes his first Rule  Denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat unum  According to these Rules it will be allowable to make use of several Fables or to speak more correctly of several Incidents which may be divided into several Fables provided they are so ordered that the Unity of the Fable be not spoil'd This liberty is still greater in the Epic Poem because 'tis of a larger extent and ought to be entire and compleat  I will explain my self more distinctly by the Practice of  Homer  No doubt but one might make four distinct Fables out of these four following Instructions  Division between those of the same Party exposes them entirely to their enemies  Conceal your Weakness and you will be dreaded as much as if you had none of those imperfections of which they are ignorant  When your strength is only feign'd and founded only in the Opinion of others never venture so far as if your strength was real  The more you agree together the less hurt can your Enemies do you  'Tis plain I say that each of these particular Maxims might serve for the Groundwork of a Fiction and one might make four distinct Fables out of them May one not then put all these into one single  Epopea  Not unless one single Fable can be made out of all The Poet indeed may have so much skill as to unite all into one Body as Members and Parts each of which taken asunder would be imperfect and if he joins them so as that this Conjunction shall be no hindrance at all to the Unity and the regular Simplicity of the Fable This is what  Homer  has done with such success in the composition of the  Iliad    The Division between  Achilles  and his Allies tended to the ruin of their Designs  Patroclus  comes to their relief in the Armour of this Heroe and  Hector  retreats    But this young Man pushing the advantage which his disguize gave him too far ventures to engage with  Hector  himself but not being master of  Achilles  's strength whom he only represented in outward appearance he is killed and by  this means leaves the  Grecian  Affairs in the same disorder from which in that disguise he came to free them  Achilles  provok'd at the death of his Friend is reconciled and revenges his loss by the death of  Hector These various incidents being thus united do not make different Actions and Fables but are only the uncompleat and unfinish'd parts of one and the same Action and Fable which alone can be said to be compleat and entire And all these Maxims of the Moral are easily reduc'd into these two parts which in my opinion cannot be separated without enervating the force of both The two parts are these  Concordiâ resparvae crescunt discordiâ magnae dilabuntur  Salust de bello Jug  That a right Understanding is the preservation and Discord the destruction of States  Tho' then the Poet has made use of two parts in his Poems each of which might have serv'd for a Fable as we have observ'd Yet this Multiplication cannot be call'd a vicious and irregular  Polymythia  contrary to the necessary Unity and Simplicity of the Fable but it gives the Fable another qualification altogether necessary and regular namely its Perfection and finishing stroke  SECT V  Of the  Action  of the Epic Poem  THE Action of a Poem is the Subject which the Poet undertakes proposes and builds upon So that the Moral and the Instructions which are the End of the Epic Poem are not the Matter of it Those the Poets leave in their Allegorical and figurative obscurity They only give notice at the  Exordium  that they sing some  Action  The  Revenge of  Achilles the  Return of  Ulysses  c  Since then the Action is the Matter of a Fable it is evident that whatever incidents are essential to the Fable or constitute a part of it are necessary also to the Action and are parts of the Epic Matter none of which ought to be omitted Such for instance are the contention of  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  the slaughter  Hector  makes in the  Grecian  Army the Re union of the  Greek  Princes and lastly the Resettlement and Victory which was the consequence of that Reunion  There are four qualifications in the Epic Action the first is its  Unity  the second its  Integrity  the third its  Importance  the fourth its  Duration  The Unity of the Epic Action as well as the Unity of the Fable does not consist either in the Unity of the Heroe or in the Unity of Time Three things I suppose are necessary to it The first is to make use of no Episode but what arises from the very platform and foundation of the Action and is as it were a natural member of the body The second is exactly to Unite these Episodes and these Members with one another And the third is never to finish any Episode so as it may seem to be an entire Action but to let each Episode still appear in its own particular nature as the member of a body and as a part of it self not compleat  Of the Beginning Middle and End of the Action  Aristotle  not only says that the Epic Action should be One but adds that it should be entire perfect and compleat and for this purpose ought to have a  Beginning  a  Middle  and an  End  These three parts of a whole are too generally and universally denoted by the words Beginning Middle and End we may interpret them more precisely and say That the Causes and Designs of an Action are the Beginning That the Effects of these Causes and the Difficulties that are met with in the execution of these designs are the Middle and that the Unravelling and Resolution of these difficulties are the End  The Action of the  Iliad  Homer  's design in the  Iliad  is to relate the Anger and Revenge of  Achilles  The Beginning of this Action is the Change of  Achilles  from a calm to a passionate temper The Middle is the Effects of his Passion and all the illustrious Deaths it is the Cause of The End of this same Action is the Return of  Achilles  to his Calmness of temper again All was quiet in the  Grecian  Camp when  Agamemnon  their General provokes  Apollo  against them whom he was willing to appease afterwards at the cost and prejudice of  Achilles  who had no part in his fault This then is an exact Beginning It supposes nothing before and requires after it the Effects of this Anger  Achilles  revenges himself and that is an exact Middle it supposes before it the Anger of  Achilles  this Revenge is the Effect of it Then this  Middle requires after it the Effects of this Revenge which is the Satisfaction of  Achilles  for the Revenge had not been compleat unless  Achilles  had been satisfied By this means the Poet makes his Heroe after he was glutted by the Mischief he had done to  Agamemnon  by the death of  Hector  and the Honour he did his Friend by insulting o'er his Murderer he makes him I say to be moved by the Tears and Misfortunes of King  Priam  We see him as calm at the End of the Poem during the Funeral of  Hector  as he was at the Beginning of the Poem whilst the Plague raged among the  Grecians  This End is just since the Calmness of temper  Achilles  re enjoy'd is only an Effect of the Revenge which ought to have preceded And after this no Body expects any more of his Anger Thus has  Homer  been very exact in the Beginning Middle and End of the Action he made choice of for the Subject of his  Iliad  The Action of the  Odyssey  His Design in the  Odyssey  was to describe the Return of  Ulysses  from the Siege of  Troy  and his Arrival at  Ithaca  He opens this Poem with the complaints of  Minerva  against  Neptune  who opposed the Return of this Heroe and against  Calypso  who detain'd him in an Island from  Ithaca  Is this a Beginning No doubtless the Reader would know why  Neptune  is displeas'd with  Ulysses  and how this Prince came to be with  Calypso  He would know how he came from  Troy  thither The Poet answers his Demands out of the Mouth of  Ulysses  himself who relates these things and begins the Action by the Recital of his Travels from the City of  Troy  It signifies little whether the Beginning of the Action be the Beginning of the Poem The Beginning of this Action is that which happens to  Ulysses  when upon his leaving  Troy  he bends his Course for  Ithaca  The Middle comprehends all the Misfortunes he endured and all the Disorders of his own Government The End is the reinstating of this Hero in the peaceable possession of his Kingdom where he was acknowledg'd by his Son his Wife his Father and several others The Poet was sensible he should have ended ill had he gone no farther than the death of these Princes who were the Rivals and Enemies of  Ulysses  because the Reader might have look'd for some Revenge  which the Subjects of these Princes might have taken on him who had kill'd their Sovereigns But this Danger over and the People vanquished and quieted there was nothing more to be expected The Poem and the Action have all their Parts and no more  But the Order of the  Odyssey  differs from that of the  Iliad  in that the  Poem  does not begin with the Beginning of the  Action  Of the Causes and Beginning of the Action  The  Causes of the Action  are also what the Poet is oblig'd to give an Account of There are three sorts of Causes the Humours the Interests and the Designs of Men and these different Causes of an Action are likewise often the Causes of one another every Man taking up those Interests in which his Humour ingages him and forming those Designs to which his Humour and Interest incline him Of all these the Poet ought to inform his Readers and render them conspicuous in his principal Personages  Homer  has ingeniously begun his  Odyssey  with the Transactions at  Ithaca  during the absence of  Ulysses  If he had begun with the Travels of his Heroe he would scarce have spoken of any one else and a Man might have read a great deal of the Poem without conceiving the least Idea of  Telemachus    Penelope  or her Suitors who had so great a share in the Action but in the beginning he has pitch'd upon besides these Personages whom he discovers he represents  Ulysses  in his full Length and from the very first opening one sees the Interest which the Gods take in the Action  The Skill and Care of the same Poet may be seen likewise in inducing his Personages in the first Book of his  Iliad  where he discovers the Humours the Interests and the Designs of  Agamemnon    Achilles    Hector    Ulysses  and several others and even of the Deities And in his Second he makes a Review of the  Grecian  and  Trojan  Armies which is full Evidence that all we have here said is very necessary  Of the Middle or Intrigue of the Action  As these  Causes  are the  Beginning  of the Action the opposite Designs against that of the Hero are the  Middle  of it and form that Difficulty or  Intrigue  which makes up the greatest part of  the Poem the Solution or  Unravelling  commences when the Reader begins to see that difficulty remov'd and the doubts clear'd up  Homer  has divided each of his Poems into two Parts and has put a particular Intrigue and the Solution of it into each Part  The first Part of the  Iliad  is the Anger of  Achilles  who is for revenging himself upon  Agamemnon  by the means of  Hector  and the  Trojans  The  Intrigue  comprehends the three days Fight which happen'd in the Absence of  Achilles  and it consists on one side in the resistance of  Agamemnon  and the  Grecians  and on the other in the revengeful and inexorable Humour of  Achilles  which would not suffer him to be reconcil'd The Loss of the  Grecians  and the Despair of  Agamemnon  prepare for a solution by the satisfaction which the incens'd Heroe receiv'd from it The death of  Patroclus  join'd to the Offers of  Agamemnon  which of it self had prov'd ineffectual remove this Difficulty and make the untravelling of the first part  This death is likewise the Beginning of the second Part since it puts  Achilles  upon the design of revenging himself on  Hector  But the design of  Hector  is opposite to that of  Achilles  This  Trojan  is valiant and resolv'd to stand on his own defence This Valour and Resolution of  Hector  are on his part the cause of the Intrigue All the Endeavours  Achilles  us'd to meet with  Hector  and be the death of him and the contrary Endeavours of the  Trojan  to keep out of his Reach and defend himself are the intrigue which comprehends the battle of the last day The unravelling begins at the death of  Hector  and besides that it contains the insulting of  Achilles  over his Body the Honours he paid to  Patroclus  and the Intreaties of King  Priam  The regrets of this King and the other  Trojans  in the sorrowful Obsequies they paid to  Hector  's body end the unravelling they justifie the satisfaction of  Achilles  and demonstrate his Tranquillity  The first part of the  Odyssey  is the return of  Ulysses  into  Ithaca Neptune  opposes it by raising tempests and this makes the Intrigue The unravelling is the arrival of  Ulysses  upon his own  Island where  Neptune  could offer him no farther injury The second Part is the reinstating this Heroe in his own Government The Princes that are his Rivals oppose him and this is a fresh Intrigue The Solution of it begins at their deaths and is compleated as soon as the  Ithacans  were appeas'd  These two Parts in the  Odyssey  have not one common Intrigue The Anger of  Achilles  forms both the Intrigues in the  Iliad  and it is so far the Matter of this  Epopéa  that the very Beginning and End of this Poem depend on the Beginning and End of this Anger But let the Desire  Achilles  had to revenge himself and the Desire  Ulysses  had to return to his own Country be never so near ally'd yet we cannot place them under one and the same Notion For that Desire of  Ulysses  is not a Passion that Begins and Ends in the Poem with the Action 'tis a natural Habit nor does the Poet propose it for his Subject as he does the Anger of  Achilles  We have already observ'd what is meant by the  Intrigue  and the  Unravelling  thereof let us now say something of the Manner of forming both These two should arise naturally out of the very Essence and Subject of the Poem and are to be deduced from thence Their Conduct is so exact and natural that it seems as if their Action had presented them with whatever they inserted without putting themselves to the Trouble of a farther Inquiry  What is more usual and natural to Warriors than Anger Heat Passion and Impatience of bearing the least Affront or Disrespect This is what forms the Intrigue of the  Iliad  and every thing we read there is nothing else but the Effect of this Humour and these Passions  What more natural and usual Obstacle to those who take Voyages than the Sea the Winds and the Storms  Homer  makes this the Intrigue of the first Part of the  Odyssey  And for the second he makes use of almost the infallible effect of the long Absence of a Master whose return is quite despair'd of  viz  the Insolence of his Servants and Neighbours the Danger of his Son and Wife and the Sequestration of his Estate Besides an Absence of almost twenty Years and the insupportable Fatigues  joyn'd to the Age of which  Ulysses  then was might induce him to believe that he should not be own'd by those who thought him dead and whose Interest it was to have him really so Therefore if he had presently declar'd who he was and had call'd himself  Ulysses  they would easily have destroy'd him as an Impostor before he had an Opportunity to make himself known  There could be nothing more natural nor more necessary than this ingenious Disguise to which the advantages his Enemies had taken of his Absence had reduc'd him and to which his long Misfortunes had enur'd him This allow'd him an opportunity without hazarding any thing of taking the best measures he could against those persons who could not so much as mistrust any harm from him This way was afforded him by the very Nature of his Action to execute his Designs and overcome the Obstacles it cast before him And 'tis this contest between the Prudence and the Dissimulation of a single Man on one hand and the ungovernable Insolence of so many Rivals on the other which constitutes the Intrigue of the second Part of the  Odyssey  Of the End or Unravelling of the Action  If the  Plot  or  Intrigue  must be natural and such as springs from the very Subject as has been already urg'd Then the  Winding up  of the Plot by a more sure claim must have this Qualification and be a probable consequence of all that went before As this is what the Readers regard more than the rest so should the Poet be more exact in it This is the End of the Poem and the last Impression that is to be stamp'd upon them  We shall find this in the  Odyssey Ulysses  by a Tempest is cast upon the Island of the  Phaeacians  to whom he discovers himself and desires they would favor his Return to his own Country which was not very far distant One cannot see any reason why the King of this Island should refuse such a reasonable Request to a Heroe whom he seem'd to have in great esteem The  Phaeacians  indeed had heard him tell the Story of his Adventures and in this fabulous recital consisted all the advantage they could derive from his Presence for the Art of War which they admir'd in him his Undauntedness under Dangers his indefatigable Patience and other Virtues were such as these Islanders  were not used to All their Talent lay in singing and dancing and whatsoever was charming in a quiet life And here we see how dextrously  Homer  prepares the Incidents he makes use of These People could do no less for the Account with which  Ulysses  had so much entertain'd them than afford him a Ship and a safe Convoy which was of little expence or trouble to them  When he arriv'd his long Absence and the Travels which had disfigur'd him made him altogether unknown and the Danger he would have incurr'd had he discover'd himself too soon forced him to a Disguise Lastly this Disguise gave him an Opportunity of surprizing those young Suitors who for several years together had been accustomed to nothing but to sleep well and fare daintily  It was from these Examples that  Aristotle  drew this Rule  "that Whatever concludes the Poem should so spring from the very constitution of the Fable as if it were a  necessary  or at least a  probable  consequence"  SECT VI  The Time of the Action  THE  Time  of the Epic Action is not fix'd like that of the Dramatic Poem It is much longer for an uninterrupted Duration is much more necessary in an Action which one sees and is present at than in one which we only read or hear repeated Besides Tragedy is fuller of Passion and consequently of such a Violence as cannot admit of so long a Duration  The  Iliad  containing an Action of  Anger  and  Violence  the Poet allows it but a short time about  forty days  The Design of the  Odyssey  required another Conduct the Character of the Hero is  Prudence  and  Longsuffering  therefore the Time of its Duration is much longer above  eight Years  The Passions of the Epic Poem  The  Passions  of Tragedy are different from those of the Epic Poem In the former  Terror  and  Pity  have the chief place the Passion that seems most peculiar to Epic Poetry is  Admiration  Besides this  Admiration  which in general distinguishes the Epic Poem from the Dramatic each Epic Poem has likewise some  peculiar Passion  which distinguishes it in particular from other Epic Poems and constitutes a kind of singular and individual difference  between these Poems of the same Species These singular Passions correspond to the  Character  of the  Hero Anger  and  Terror  reign throughout the  Iliad  because  Achilles  is angry and the most Terrible of all Men The  Aeneid  has all  soft  and  tender Passions  because that is the Character of  Aeneas  The Prudence Wisdom and Constancy of  Ulysses  do not allow him either of these Extremes therefore the Poet does not permit one of them to be predominant in the  Odyssey  He confines himself to  Admiration  only which he carries to an higher pitch than in the  Iliad  And 'tis upon this account that he introduces a great many more Machines in the  Odyssey  into the Body of the Action than are to be seen in the Actions of the other two Poems  The Manners  The  Manners  of the Epic Poem ought to be  poetically good  but it is not necessary they be always  morally  so They are poetically good when one may discover the Virtue or Vice the good or ill Inclinations of every one who speaks or acts They are poetically bad when Persons are made to speak or act out of Character or inconsistently or unequally The Manners of  Aeneas  and of  Mezentius  are equally good consider'd poetically because they equally demonstrate the Piety of the one and the Impiety of the other  Character of the Heroe  'Tis requisite to make the same distinction between a Heroe in Morality and a Heroe in Poetry as between moral and poetical Goodness  Achilles  had as much right to the latter as  Aeneas Aristotle  says that the Heroe of a Poem should be neither good nor bad neither advanc'd above the rest of mankind by his Virtues or sunk beneath 'em by his Vices that he may be the properer and fuller Example to others both what to imitate and what to decline  The other Qualifications of the  Manners  are that they be  suitable  to the Causes which either raise or discover them in the Persons that they have an exact  Resemblance  to what History or Fable have delivered of those persons to whom they are ascrib'd and that there be an  Equality  in them so that no man is made to act or speak out of his character  Unity of the Character  But this Equality is not sufficient for the  Unity of the Character  'tis further necessary that the same Spirit appear in all sort of  Encounters Thus  Aeneas  acting with great  Piety  and  Mildness  in the first part of the  Aeneid  which requires no other Character and afterwards appearing illustrious in Heroic valour in the wars of the second part but there without any appearance either of a hard or a soft disposition would doubtless be far from offending against the  Equality  of the Manners But yet there would be no  Simplicity  or  Unity  in the Character So that besides the Qualities that claim their particular place upon different occasions there must be One appearing throughout which commands over all the rest And without this we may affirm 'tis no Character  One may indeed make a Heroe as valiant as  Achilles  as pious as  Aeneas  and as prudent as  Ulysses  But 'tis a meer Chimaera to imagine a Heroe that has the Valour of  Achilles  the Piety of  Aeneas  and the Prudence of  Ulysses  at one and the same time This Vision might happen to an Author who would suit the character of a Heroe to whatever each part of the Action might naturally require without regarding the Essence of the Fable or the Unity of the Character in the same person upon all sorts of occasions This Heroe would be the mildest bestnatur'd Prince in the world and also the most cholerick hardhearted and implacable creature imaginable he would be extreamly tender like  Aeneas  extreamly violent like  Achilles  and yet have the indifference of  Ulysses  that is incapable of the two extremes Would it not be in vain for the Poet to call this Person by the same name throughout  Let us reflect on the effects it would produce in several Poems whose Authors were of opinion that the chief character of a Heroe is that of an accomplish'd Man They would be all alike all valiant in Battle prudent in Council pious in the acts of Religion courteous civil magnificent and lastly endued with all the prodigious Virtues any Poet could invent All this would be independent from the Action and the Subject of the Poem and upon seeing each Heroe separated from the rest of the work we should not easily guess to what Action and to what Poem the Heroe belong'd So that we should see that none of those would have a Character since the Character is that which makes  a person discernable and which distinguishes him from all others  This commanding Quality in  Achilles  is his Anger in  Ulysses  the art of Dissimulation in  Aeneas  Meekness Each of these may be stil'd by way of eminence the Character in these Heroes  But these Characters cannot be alone 'Tis absolutely necessary that some other should give them a lustre and embellish them as far as they are capable Either by hiding the defects that are in each by some noble and shining Qualities as the Poet has done the Anger of  Achilles  by shading it with an extraordinary Valour Or by making them entirely of the nature of a true and solid Virtue as is to be observ'd in the two others The Dissimulation of  Ulysses  is a part of his Prudence and the Meekness of  Aeneas  is wholly employ'd in submitting his Will to the Gods For the making up this Union our Poets have joyn'd together such Qualities as are by nature the most compatible  Valour  with  Anger    Meekness  with  Piety  and  Prudence  with  Dissimulation  This last Union was necessary for the Goodness of  Ulysses  for without that his Dissimulation might have degenerated into Wickedness and Doubledealing  SECT VII  Of the Machinery  WE come now to the  Machines  of the Epic Poem The chief Passion which it aims to excite being  Admiration  nothing is so conducive to that as the  Marvellous  and the importance and dignity of the Action is by nothing so greatly elevated as by the  Care and Interposition of Heaven  These Machines are of three sorts Some are  Theological  and were invented to explain the nature of God Others are  Physical  and represent things of Nature The last are  Moral  and are the Images of Virtues and Vices  Homer  and the Ancients have given to their Deities the Manners Passions and Vices of Men Their Poems are wholly Allegorical and in this view it is easier to defend  Homer  than to blame him We cannot accuse him for making mention of many Gods for his bestowing Passions upon them or even introducing them fighting against men The Scripture uses the like figures and expressions  If it be allowable to speak thus of the Gods in  Theology  much more in the Fictions of  Natural Philosophy  where if a Poet describes the Deities he must give them such Manners Speeches and Actions as are conformable to the nature of the things they represent under those Divinities The case is the same in  Moral  Deities  Minerva  is wise because she represents Prudence  Venus  is both good or bad because the Passion of Love is capable of these contrary qualities  Since among the Gods of a Poem some are good some bad and some indifferently either and since of our Passions we make so many allegorical Deities one may attribute to the  Gods  all that is done in the Poem whether good or evil But these Deities do not act constantly in one and the same manner  Sometimes they act invisibly and by meer Inspiration which has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous being no more than what we say every day  "That some God has assisted us or some Daemon has instigated us"  At other times they appear visibly and manifest themselves to men in a manner altogether miraculous and praeternatural  The third way has something of both the others It is in truth a miracle but is not commonly so accounted This includes Dreams Oracles  c  All these ways must be  Probable  for so necessary as the Marvellous is to the Epic Action as nothing is so conducive to Admiration yet we can on the other hand admire nothing that we think impossible Tho' the Probability of these Machines be of a very large extent since 'tis founded upon Divine Power it is not without limitations There are numerous Instances of allowable and probable Machines in the Epic Poems where the Gods are no less Actors than the Men But the less credible sort such as  Metamorphoses  c are far more rare  This suggests a Reflection on the Method of rendring those Machines probable which in their own nature are hardly so Those which require only  Divine Probability  should be so disengag'd from the Action that one might substract them from it without destroying the Action But those which are essential and necessary should be grounded upon  Human Probability  and not  on the sole Power of God Thus the Episodes of  Circe  the  Syrens    Polyphemus  c are necessary to the Action of the  Odyssey  and yet not humanly probable Yet  Homer  has artificially reduc'd them to human Probability by the Simplicity and Ignorance of the  Phaeacians  before whom he causes those recitals to be made  The next Question is Where and on what occasions Machines may be used It is certain  Homer  and  Virgil  make use of them every where and scarce suffer any Action to be perform'd without them  Petronius  makes this a Precept  Per ambages deorumque ministeria  c The Gods are mention'd in the very  Proposition  of their Works the  Invocation  is addrest to them and the whole  Narration  is full of them The Gods are the  Causes  of the Action they form the  Intrigue  and bring about the  Solution  The precept of  Aristotle  and  Horace  that the unravelling of the Plot should not proceed from a Miracle or the appearance of a God has place only in Dramatic Poetry not in the Epic For it is plain that both in the Solution of the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  the Gods are concern'd In the former the Deities meet to appease the Anger of  Achilles    Iris  and  Mercury  are sent to that purpose and  Minerva  eminently assists  Achilles  in the decisive combate with  Hector  In the  Odyssey  the same Goddess fights close by  Ulysses  against the Suitors and concludes that Peace betwixt him and the  Ithacensians  which compleats the Poem  We may therefore determine that a Machine is not an Invention to extricate the Poet out of any difficulty which embarrasses him But that the Presence of a Divinity and some Action surprizing and extraordinary are inserted into almost all the parts of his work in order to render it more Majestic and more Admirable But this mixture ought to be so made that the Machines might be retrench'd without taking any thing from the Action At the same time it gives the Readers a lesson of Piety and Virtue and

had now remain'd seven years in the island of  Calypso  when the Gods assembled in council proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country For this purpose it is concluded to send  Mercury  to  Calypso  and  Pallas  immediately descends to  Ithaca  She holds a conference with  Telemachus  in the shape of  Mentes  King of the  Taphians  in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his Father  Ulysses  to  Pylos  and  Sparta  where  Nestor  and  Menelaus  yet reign'd then after having visibly display'd her divinity disappears The suitors of  Penelope  make great entertainments and riot in her palace till night  Phemius  sings to them the return of the  Grecians  till  Penelope  puts a stop to the song Some words arise between the suitors and  Telemachus  who summons the council to meet the day following  WK  PFsc  THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  _THE Man for Wisdom's various arts renown'd  Long exercis'd in woes oh Muse resound  Who

same method thro' the course of these Annotations upon the  Odyssey  as in those upon the  Iliad  considering  Homer  chiefly as a Poet endeavouring to make his beauties  understood  and not to praise without a reason given It is equally an extreme on the one hand to think  Homer  has no human defects and on the other to dwell so much upon those defects as to depreciate his beauties The greater part of Criticks form a general character from the observation of particular errors taken in their own oblique or imperfect views which is as unjust as to make a judgment of the beauty of a man's body from the shadow it happens to cast in such or such a position To convince the Reader of this intended impartiality we readily allow the  Odyssey  to be inferior to the  Iliad  in many respects It has not that sublimity of spirit or that enthusiasm of poetry but then it must be allow'd if it be less noble it is more instructive The other abounds with more Heroism this with more Morality The  Iliad  gives us a draught of Gods and Heroes of discord of contentions and  scenes of slaughter the  Odyssey  sets before us a scene more amiable the landschapes of nature the pleasures of private life the duties of every station the hospitality of ancient times a less busy but more agreeable portrait The  Iliad  concludes with the ruin the  Odyssey  with the happiness of a nation  Horace  was of the same opinion as is evident from the epistle to  Lollius  Seditione dolis scelere libidine ira  Iliacos  intra muros peccatur extra  Rursus quid virtus quid sapientia possit  Utile proposuit nobis exemplar  Ulyssem  I  VERSE  The Man for Wisdom  c  Homer  opens his Poem with the utmost simplicity and modesty he continually grows upon the reader  Non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem  Cogitat ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat  Cicero  lays this down as a rule for the Orator  principia verecunda non elatis intensa verbis  and  Horace  for the Poet  Nec sic incipies c  He proposes the beginning of the  Odyssey  as a pattern for all future poems and has translated them in his Art of poetry  Dic mihi Musa virum captae post tempora Trojae  Qui mores hominum multorum vidit urbes  May I be forgiven the arrogance if I should offer a criticism upon this translation The  sufferings  of  Ulysses  are the subject of the whole  Odyssey  and yet  Horace  has omitted the mention of those sufferings  There is another word also which seems essential that is  this is likewise omitted For the sufferings of  Ulysses  and the wisdom by which he extricated himself from them enter into the very  design of the Poem But indeed in another place he has plainly had regard to all these circumstances  Qui  domitor Trojae  multorum  providus  urbes  Et mores hominum inspexit latumque per aequor  Dum  sibi  dum  sociis  reditum parat  aspera multa  Pertulit  Epist ad Loll  I must also refute a criticism of  Rapin  who will have it that the word  includes a character of craft and low cunning unworthy of a brave spirit But  Eustathius  admirably vindicates the Poet in this respect he shews us that  no where in  Homer  signifies  or Morals and that it implies a man who could accommodate himself to every condition of life one who in the worst estate had still a reserve to free himself from it it therefore says he signifies a man that thro' experience has learn'd wisdom I have likewise the authority of  Horace  for this sense in the abovecited passage  Qui domitor Trojae multorum  providus  urbes  I take  providus  in this place to signify not only a man who noted the manners of various nations with care but also one who in calamity could foresee methods to extricate himself from it And surely nothing can be more unjust than what  Rapin  objects against  Ulysses  in employing his wisdom only in his own preservation while all his companions were lost  Homer  himself sufficiently refutes this objection and directly tells us that he employed his wisdom in the care of their safety but that they thro' their folly defeated his wisdom The words of  Homer  says  Eustathius  shew that a wise man neglects not his friends in adversity But says  Rapin  what could oblige  Homer  to begin with so dishonourable an action and place the greatest weakness of his Heroe in the very frontispiece of his Poem and invoke his Muse to sing the man who with difficulty saved himself and suffer'd his companions to be destroy'd There had been some weight in this  objection if  Ulysses  had saved his own with the loss of their lives but I cannot see any dishonour in his preserving himself by wisdom when they destroy'd themselves by folly It was chiefly by storms that they perish'd it can be no imputation to his character not to be able to restrain the effects of a tempest he did all that a wise man cou'd do he gave them such admonitions upon every emergency that if they had pursued them they had been preserved as well as  Ulysses  II  VERSE I  For Wisdom's various arts renown'd    Bossu  's observation in relation to this Epithet  given to  Ulysses  is worth transcribing The Fable of the  Odyssey  says he is wholly for the conduct and policy of a State Therefore the quality it requires is  Wisdom  but this virtue is of too large an extent for the simplicity which a just and precise  character  requires it is therefore requisite it should be limited The great art of Kings is the mystery of  Dissimulation  'Tis well known that  Lewis  the eleventh for the instruction of his Son reduc'd all the  Latin language  to these words only  viz Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare  'Twas likewise by this practice that  Saul  began his reign when he was first elected and as yet full of the spirit of God The first thing we read of him in holy Writ is  Ille vero dissimulabat se audire  Reg lib  that he made as if he did not hear the words which seditious people spoke against him  This then is the  character  which the  Greek  Poet gives his  Ulysses  in the Proposition of his Poem he calls him  to denote this prudent dissimulation which disguised him so many ways and put him upon taking so many shapes  Without mentioning any thing of  Circe  who detain'd him with her a whole year and who was famous for the transformations she made of all sorts of persons the reader finds him at first with  Calypso  the daughter of wise  Atlas  who bore up the vast pillars that reach'd from Earth to Heaven and whose knowledge penetrated into the depths of the unfathomable Ocean that  is to say who was ignorant of nothing in Heaven Earth or Sea And as the first product and principal part of so high so solid and so profound a knowledge was to know how to conceal ones self this wise man call'd his daughter by a name that signified a  secret  The Poet makes his Heroe whom he designed for a Politician to stay seven whole years with this Nymph She taught him so well that afterwards he lost no opportunity of putting her lessons in practice for he does nothing without a disguise At his parting from  Ogygia  he is cast upon the Isle of  Phaeaca  as kind as his reception was yet he stays 'till the night before he went off ere he wou'd discover himself From thence he goes to  Ithaca  the first adventure that happen'd to him there was with  Minerva  the most prudent among the Deities as  Ulysses  was the most prudent among men She says so expressly in that very passage Nor did they fail to disguise themselves  Minerva  takes upon her the shape of a shepherd and  Ulysses  tells her he was oblig'd to fly from  Crete  because he had murder'd the son of King  Idomeneus  The Goddess discovers her self first and commends him particularly because these artifices were so easie and natural to him that they seem'd to be born with him Afterwards the Heroe under the form of a beggar deceives first of all  Eumeus  then his son and last of all his wife and every body else till he found an opportunity of punishing his Enemies to whom he discover'd not himself 'till he kill'd them namely on the last night After his discovering himself in the Palace he goes the next day to deceive his father appearing at first under a borrow'd name before he wou'd give him joy of his return Thus he takes upon him all manner of shapes and dissembles to the very last But the Poet joins to this character a valour and a constancy which render him invincible in the most daring and desperate adventures  III  VERSE  Who when his arms had wrought the destin'd fall  Of sacred  Troy  Whence is it that  Ulysses  is said to have overthrown  Troy  and not  Achilles  who was of more remarkable courage than  Ulysses Eustathius  tells us that the destruction of  Troy  ought to be ascribed chiefly to  Ulysses  as he not only took away the  Palladium  but was the inventor of the stratagem of the wooden horse by which that city was conquer'd  Virgil  in his second book of the  Aeneis  gives a noble description of its destruction by which we find that  Ulysses  was not only the contriver of its ruin but bore a great share in the actions of the night in which that City was overturn'd  IV  VERSE  Vain toils their impious folly  c  By this single trait  Homer  marks an essential difference between the  Iliad  and the  Odyssey  namely that in the former Poem the people perish'd by the folly of their Kings  Quicquid delirunt reges plectuntur Achivi  In this the people perish by their own folly while their Prince omits nothing to procure their felicity A plain reason why the  Odyssey  is more calculated for the People than the  Iliad  Dacier  V  VERSE  Oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate    It may be ask'd why the Poet invokes the Muse to recount only Part of the sufferings of  Ulysses  and why those words  To Us also  are inserted To the first it may be answer'd that an heroic Poem dwells chiefly upon incidents of importance and passes over every thing that does not contribute to raise our idea of the Heroe or to the main design of the Poem To the other  Eustathius  answers several ways either says he the word  is to be taken as an expletive as it is in a thousand places in  Homer  or it means that this is a subject so considerable that it will be a theme to many  Poets or that being a true History it had spread over many nations of the world and that  Homer  himself received the story of the Poem from  Aegypt  and then the meaning will be  "Sing oh Muse to the  Greeks  as well as to other nations the sufferings of  Ulysses  "  I should prefer the first as being the most natural the rest seem forced and consequently improper for the opening of a Poem where the utmost plainness is necessary especially if we consider that  Ulysses  was a  Grecian  and it is not probable that the  Grecians  should be the least acquainted with the story or the latest to celebrate the actions of a  Grecian  VI  VERSE  Now at their native realms the  Greeks  arriv'd    It is necessary for the better understanding of the Poem to fix the period of Time from which it takes its beginning  Homer  as  Eustathius  observes does not begin with the wandrings of  Ulysses  he steps at once into the latter end of his actions and leaves the preceding story to be told by way of narration Thus in his  Iliad  he dates his Poem from the anger of  Achilles  which happen'd almost at the conclusion of the  Trojan  war From hence  Horace  drew his observation in his  Arte Poet  Semper ad eventum festinat in medias res  Non secus ac notas auditorem rapit  There are but forty eight days from the departure of  Ulysses  from  Calypso  to his discovery in  Ithaca  he had been one year with  Circe  and seven with  Calypso  when the Gods dispatched  Mercury  to that Goddess from which point of Time we are to date the  Odyssey  This observation gives a reason why the Poet invokes the Muse to recount the wandrings of this Heroe in part only for  Ulysses  as appears from the beginning of the ninth book after he left the shores of  Troy  was driven to  Ismarus  of the  Ciconians  An Historian must have begun from the fall of  Troy  and related his wandrings with truth and order for History is chiefly for instruction But a Poet takes another method and disposes every circumstance arbitrarily he chuses or rejects as suits best with his principal design and in such a manner as to give at once delight and instruction  VII  VERSE  Calypso  in her Cave constrain'd his stay    To the Remark before cited of  Bossu  upon the abode of  Ulysses  with  Calypso  may be added this of the Abbè  Fraguier  that his residing seven years in the caves of  Calypso  the Goddess of Secrecy may only be meant that he remain'd so long hid from the knowledge and enquiry of all men or that whatever befel him in all that time was lost to History or made no part in the Poem  VIII  VERSE  All but the ruthless Monarch of the Main    It may be ask'd why  Neptune  is thus enraged against  Ulysses Homer  himself tells us it was because that Heroe had put out the eye of his son  Cyclops  But if we take  Neptune  by way of Allegory for the Ocean the passage implies that the sufferings of  Ulysses  were chiefly by sea and therefore Poetry which adds a grandeur to the meanest circumstance introduces the God of it as his greatest enemy  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  In  Aethiopia  c    Strabo  in his first book delivers his opinion that  "the ancient  Grecians  included all those people who lived upon the southern Ocean from east to west in the general name of  Aethiopians  and that it was not confined to those only who lay south of  Aegypt  "  Ptolomy  says  that  "under the  Zodiac  from east to west inhabit the  Aethiopians  black of colour"  And elsewhere the same Geographer divides  Aethiopia  into the eastern and the western These eastern and western  Aethiopians  were separated by the  Arabian  or  Aegyptian  Gulf which tho' never mention'd by  Homer  as  Aristarchus  remark'd yet it is not probable says  Strabo  that he should be ignorant of it it being but a thousand stadia distant from the  Mediterranean  when he knew the  Aegyptian Thebes  which was four times as far off  Strab Plin Spondan  I will not repeat what was observ'd upon the Gods being gone to the  Aethiopians  in the first book of the  Iliad  'tis sufficient in general to observe that the  Aethiopians  were a people very religious towards the Gods and that they held a pompous feast twelve days annually to their honour and in particular that the Poet very judiciously makes use of this solemnity to remove  Neptune  out of the way who was the enemy of  Ulysses  that he may with the greater security bring off his Heroe from  Calypso  's Island  Eustathius  X  VERSE  Aegysthus    It is difficult to find a reason why in the original  Jupiter  shou'd give such an honourable appellation to  Aegysthus  as    unblameable  who had dishonoured the bed of  Agamemnon  and taken his life away especially in that very instant when he condemns the fact with so great solemnity  Eustathius  says that  Homer  an enemy to censure and invective introduces that God as having respect only to his good qualities and commending him for his general character and adds that it had been an indecency in the Poet to have given countenance to that base custom by the authority of  Jupiter Dacier  is not satisfy'd with this reason and tells us that  Homer  gives  Aegysthus  this title to vindicate  Jupiter  from the imputation of his crimes He gives us to understand that Heaven is not the cause of man's failings that he is by Creation able to act virtuously and that it is thro' his own misconduct that he deviates into evil and therefore the  meaning is this  "  Jupiter  calling to mind  Aegysthus  that  Aegysthus  whom he had created wise and virtuous and made capable to sustain that character"  And this agrees admirably with the beginning of the speech of  Jupiter  who there vindicates his own Divinity  But if this shou'd seem too refin'd it may be sufficient to take the word in that good sense which  Aegysthus  might have deserved for many good qualities Thus  Achilles  is call'd the  swift of foot  even while he stands or sleeps the first being his general character It may be further confirm'd by a passage something resembling it in the holy Scriptures The  Aegyptian  Midwives were guilty of a lye to  Pharaoh  and yet God pardons it and blesses them He blesses them not because they lyed but because they preserv'd the children of the  Israelites  XI  VERSE  Jupiter  's speech    The solemnity and sententiousness of this speech is taken notice of by  Eustathius  and surely Poetry must be highly valuable when it delivers such excellent instructions It contain'd the whole of religion amongst the antients and made Philosophy more agreeable This passage is an instance of it a passage worthy of a Christian it shews us that the Supreme Being is sovereignly good that he rewards the just and punishes the unjust and that the folly of man and not the decree of Heaven is the cause of human calamity  XII  VERSE  Hermes  I sent  c  It would be endless to observe every moral passage in the  Odyssey  the whole of it being but one lesson of Morality But surely it must be a pleasure to the Reader to learn what notions the antients had of a Deity from the oldest book extant except the book of  Moses  Jupiter  here declares that he never fails to warn mankind from evil and that he had sent by  Mercury  for this purpose to  Aegysthus  It may be ask'd what is this  Mercury  whom  Jupiter  sends It is the light of Nature which Heaven implants in the breast of every man and which as  Cicero  says is not only more ancient than the world but coeval with the Master of the world himself He writes to this effect  There was from the beginning such a thing as Reason a direct emanation from Nature it self which prompted to good and averted from evil A Reason which did not then become a law when it was first reduced to writing but was so even from the moment it existed and it existed from ever of an equal date with the divine Intelligence It is the true and primordial Law proper to command and to forbid it is the Reason of the great  Jupiter  That Reason of the supreme Being is here call'd  Mercury  that Reason flowing from God which is constantly dictating to the most corrupted hearts  this is good  or  this is evil  Hence arose an ancient Proverb recorded by  Simplicius    Reason is a  Mercury  to all men  Epictetus lib Arrian says Apollo  knew that  Laius  would not obey his Oracle  Apollo  nevertheless did not neglect to prophecy to  Laius  those evils that threaten'd him The goodness of the Divinity never fails to advertise mankind that source of truth is ever open and free but men are ever incredulous disobedient and rebellious  Dacier  XIII  VERSE  Minerva  's Speech    It may be ask'd what relation  Ulysses  has to  Aegysthus  that the mention of the one should immediately give occasion for the remembrance of the other and it may appear unnatural in the Poet to give rise to his Poem by so unexpected a transition from  Aegysthus  to  Ulysses Eustathius  vindicates  Homer  by shewing that it is not only beautiful but natural to take rise from what offers it self to our immediate observation What can be more natural when  Jupiter  is relating how he punishes the wicked than for Wisdom or  Minerva  to suggest that the good ought to be rewarded There is no forced introduction  no artful preparation but the whole arises from the occasion which is a great beauty  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Amidst an Isle  c  There was according to true History such an Island of  Calypso  of which  Strabo  writes that  Solon  gives an account of the Island  Atlantis  bordering upon  Aegypt  and that he went thither to make enquiry and learn'd that an Island was once there but by time was vanished  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  Atlas  her Sire to whose farpiercing eye  The wonders of the Deep expanded lie  Th' eternal Columns which on earth he rears  End in the starry vault and prop the Spheres    Atlas  is here said to understand all the depths of the Sea but the Epithet  apply'd to him has two different significations It implies either  one whose thoughts are full of terrible and dismal things  or  one who has infinite knowledge and unbounded views  and 'tis doubtful which of them  Homer  means To reconcile both may we not think our Author had heard something of the ancient tradition which makes  Atlas  the same person with  Enoch  and represents him as a great Astronomer who prophecy'd of the universal deluge and exhorted mankind to repentance Therefore he nam'd his son  Methuselah  to show that after his death the waters shou'd overspread the face of the earth His continual lamentations on this occasion caus'd him to be call'd the  Weeper  for the world is always an enemy to melancholy predictions Thus  Homer  upon the credit of this Tradition might very well call  Atlas    one whose thoughts ran upon dismal things  or  one whose views and cares were vastly extended  I insist no otherwise upon this but as a conjecture yet it is further strengthen'd by what follows in the next lines  That  Atlas  sustains those Columns which being fixed upon the earth support the Heavens  This is generally interpreted of his great skill in Astronomy and Geography But may not the reason be more particular Since  Atlas  or  Enoch  had prophecy'd of the Deluge and since that prediction was looked upon as the effect of his skill in Astronomy might it not be said he knew the abysses of the Sea and sustain'd the pillars of Heaven to express that he knew how the fountains of the deep and the waters above the Heavens shou'd unite to drown the earth  As to the image of the  pillars of Heaven  it is frequent in the sacred books and used to express the height of vast mountains  Pindar  calls  Aetna  the  and there might probably be something more particular that furnished  Homer  with this idea I mean the pillars of  Hercules  wellknown in his time and neighbouring to the mountain he describes  Dacier  See the description of this mountain in the th book of  Virgil  where the same image is preserv'd without any hint of allegory As indeed it is no more than a poetical manner of expressing the  great height  and  extensive prospect  of the mountain  XVI  VERSE  To see the smoke from his lov'd Palace rise    There is an agreeable tenderness in this Image and nothing can better paint the ardent desire a man naturally has to review his native country after a long absence This is still stronger than that which  Cicero  extols in several places of his works that  Ulysses  preferr'd the sight of  Ithaca  to the Immortality proffer'd him by  Calypso  He here desires to purchase at the price of his life the pleasure not of returning to his country but even of seeing at a distance the very smoke of it  Dacier  There are some things dispers'd in this speech of  Pallas  which I shall lay together as that  Minerva  makes it an aggravation to the calamity of  Ulysses  to be detain'd by a Goddess that loves him that he is enclosed in an Island and she adds round which the Seas flow as if that was not common to all Islands but these  expressions are used to shew the impossibility of the escape of  Ulysses  without the interposition of  Jupiter  In the conclusion she observes that  Ulysses  never neglected to sacrifice before  Troy  this is said to shew the great piety of  Ulysses  who not only paid his sacrifices in  Ithaca  where he abounded in riches but amongst strangers in an enemy's country where there might be a scarcity of offerings  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  Daughter what words  c  This verse is frequently repeated both in the  Iliad  and the  Odyssey  it has here a particular energy  Jupiter  reproves  Minerva  for supposing he could ever be unmindful of an Heroe so pious as  Ulysses  It is spoken with vehemence an instance says  Eustathius  that it is not only equitable but an attribute of Divinity for rulers to remember those who serve them faithfully  XVIII  VERSE  T'avenge his Giantson    It is artful in the Poet to tell the Reader the occasion of the sufferings of  Ulysses  in the opening of the Poem 'tis a justice due to his character to shew that his misfortunes are not the consequence of his crimes but the effect of  Neptune  's anger  It is observable that  Homer  does not stop to explain how  Ulysses  put out the eye of the  Cyclops  he hastens forward into the middle of his Poem and leaves that for the future narration of  Ulysses  XIX  VERSE  Mean time  Telemachus  demands my care  c  Rapin  has rais'd several objections against this piece of conduct in  Homer  He tells us that the action of the  Odyssey  is imperfect that it begins with the voyages of  Telemachus  and ends with those  of  Ulysses  That the four first books are all concerning  Telemachus  That his voyage bears no proportion to that of  Ulysses  that it contributes nothing to his return which is brought about by  Jupiter  and the assistance of the  Phaeacians  that this gave occasion to  Beni  in his  academical discourses  to assert that the Fable of the  Odyssey  is double that the four first books of it are neither Episode nor part of an action nor have any connexion with the rest of the work  I am of opinion that these objections are made with too great severity The destruction of the Suitors is the chief hinge upon which the Poem turns as it contributes chiefly to the reestablishment of  Ulysses  in his country and regality and whatever contributes to this end contributes to the principal action and is of a piece with the rest of the Poem and that this voyage does so is evident in that it gives a defeat to the Suitors and controuls their insolence it preserves  Ulysses  's throne and bed inviolate in that it gives  Telemachus  courage to resist their attempts It sets his character in a fair point of light who is the second personage of the Poem and is to have a great share in the future actions of it  Eustathius  judiciously observes that  Homer  here prepares the way for the defeat of the Suitors the chief design of his Poem and lays the groundwork of probability on which he intends to build his Poem and reconcile it to the rules of credibility  If it be ask'd for what end this voyage of  Telemachus  is made the answer is to enquire after  Ulysses  So that whatever Episodes are interwoven  Ulysses  is still in view and whatever  Telemachus  acts is undertaken solely upon his account and consequently whatever is acted contributes to the principal design the restoration of  Ulysses  So that the Fable is entire and the Action not double  'Tis to be remember'd also that the sufferings of  Ulysses  are the subject of the Poem his personal calamities are not only intended but his domestic misfortunes and by this conduct  Homer  shews us the extent of his misfortunes His Queen is attempted his Throne threaten'd and his Wealth consumed in riot  Ulysses  suffers in  Telemachus  and in every circumstance of life is unhappy  XX  VERSE  To distant  Sparta  and the spacious waste Of sandy  Pyle  Rapin  is very severe upon this conduct When  Telemachus  says he is to search for his father in the Courts of  Greece  he cannot make the least progress without  Minerva  'tis she who inspires his thoughts and assists in the execution Could not honour duty or nature have moved his heart toward an absent father The Machine adds he has not the least appearance of probability inasmuch as the Goddess conducts him to every place except only where  Ulysses  resides of which she ought by no means to be ignorant upon the account of her Divinity  But surely nothing can be be more natural than for a son in order to gain intelligence of an absent father to enquire in those places and of those persons where and from whom he is most likely to have information Such is the conduct of  Telemachus  And Poetry which delights in the Wonderful because this conduct agrees with wisdom ascribes it to  Minerva  the Goddess of it No doubt but  Minerva  knew where  Ulysses  resided but men must act as men such an immediate interposition as  Rapin  requires had stopp'd at once the fountain of the Poet's invention If what a Poet invents be natural it is justifiable and he may give the rein to his imagination if he restrain it from running into extravagance and wildness  XXI  VERSE  'Tis mine to form his green unpractis'd years  c  In this the Poet draws the outlines of what he is to fill up in the four subsequent books and nothing can give us a greater idea of his unbounded invention than his building upon so plain a foundation such a noble superstructure He entertains us with variety of Episodes historical relations and manners of those  ancient times It must be confess'd that the Characters in the  Odyssey  and the number of the chief Actors are but few and yet the Poet never tires he varies and diversifies the story so happily that he is continually opening new scenes to engage our attention He resembles his own  Proteus  he is capable of all shapes yet in all shapes the same Deity  XXII  VERSE  Mentes  the Monarch of the  Taphian  land    We are told by tradition that  Homer  was so sensible of friendship that to do honour to his particular friends he immortalized their names in his Poems In the  Iliad  he has shewn his gratitude to  Tychius  and in the  Odyssey  to  Mentes    Phemius  and  Mentor  This  Mentes  was a famous Merchant of the isle of  Leucade  who received  Homer  at  Smyrna  and made him his companion in all his voyages It is to this  Mentes  we owe the two Poems of  Homer  for the Poet in all probability had never wrote them without those lights and informations he receiv'd and the discoveries he was enabled to make by those travels  Homer  is not contented to give his name to the King of the  Taphians  but feigns also that the Goddess of Wisdom chose to appear in his shape preferably to that of all the Kings who were nearer neighbours to  Ithaca Eustathius  thinks there might have been a real King of  Taphos  of this name who was a friend to  Ulysses  This may possibly be but I would chuse to adhere rather to the old tradition as it does honour to friendship  Dacier  XXIII  VERSE  Enormous riot and misrule    This is the first appearance of the Suitors and the Poet has drawn their pictures in such colours as are agreeable to their characters thro' the whole Poem They are as  Horace  expresses it  Fruges consumere nati  Sponsi Penelopes Nebulones  The Poet gives a fine contrast between them and  Telemachus  he entertains himself with his own thoughts weighs the sum of things and beholds with a virtuous sorrow the disorders of the Suitors He appears like  Ulysses  among his transform'd companions in the tenth book a wife man among brutes  XXIV  VERSE  At Chess they vie to captivate the Queen  Divining of their loves  There are great disputes what this Game was at which the Suitors play'd  Athenaeus  relates it from  Apian  the Grammarian who had it from  Cteson  a native of  Ithaca  that the sport was in this manner The number of the Suitors being they equally divided their men or balls that is to say on each side these were placed on the board opposite to each other Between the two sides was a vacant space in the midst of which was the main mark or  Queen  the point which all were to aim at They took their turns by lot he who took or displac'd that mark got his own in its place and if by a second man he again took it without touching any of the others he won the game and it pass'd as an omen of obtaining his mistress This principal mark or  Queen  was called by whatever name the Gamesters pleas'd and the Suitors gave it the name of  Penelope  'Tis said this Game was invented by  Palamedes  during the siege of  Troy    Sophocles in Palam    Eustath Spondan Dacier  XXV  VERSE  Griev'd that a Visitant so long should wait    The Reader will lose much of the pleasure of this Poem if he reads it without the reflection that he peruses one of the most  ancient books in the world it sets before him persons places and actions that existed three thousand years ago Here we have an instance of the humanity of those early ages  Telemachus  pays a reverence to this stranger only because he is a stranger He attends him in person and welcomes him with all the openness of ancient hospitality  XXVI  VERSE c  The Feast describ'd    There is nothing that has drawn more ridicule upon  Homer  than the frequent descriptions of his entertainments It has been judged that he was more than ordinarily delighted with them since he omits no opportunity to describe them nay his temperance has not been unsuspected according to that verse of  Horace    Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus  But we must not condemn without stronger evidence a man may commend a sumptuous entertainment or good wines without being either a drunkard or a glutton But since there are so many entertainments describ'd in the Poem it may not be improper to give this some explanation  They wash before the feast perhaps says  Eustathius  because they always at the feast made libations to the Gods The Ewer was of gold the vessel from whence the water was pour'd of silver and the cups out of which they drank were of gold  A damsel attends  Mentes  but heralds wait upon the Suitors  Eustathius  observes a decency in this conduct the Suitors were lewd debauchees and consequently a woman of modesty would have been an improper attendant upon such a company Beautiful Youths attended the company in quality of cupbearers  A Matron who has charge of the houshold  brings in the bread and the cold meats for so  Eustathius  interprets  an Officer whose employ it was to portion out the victuals brings in the meats that furnish'd out the rest of the entertainment  and after the feast a Bard diverts them with vocal and instrumental music  Dacier  is in great pain about the cold victuals she is afraid lest the Reader should think them the leavings of a former day and tells us they might possibly be in the nature of our cold  Tongues    Jambons  c But I think such fears to be groundless We must have reference to the customs of those early ages and if it was customary for cold meats to be serv'd up neither is it necessary to suppose them the leavings of the former entertainment it can be no disgrace to the hospitality of  Telemachus  XXVII  VERSE  To  Phemius  was consign'd the chorded Lyre    In ancient times Princes entertain'd in their families certain learned and wise men who were both Poets and Philosophers and not only made it their business to amuse and delight but to promote wisdom and morality  Ulysses  at his departure for  Troy  left one of these with  Penelope  and it was usual to consign in this manner the care of their wives and families to the Poets of those days as appears from a signal passage in the third book verse of the original  c  To this man  Homer  gives the name of  Phemius  to celebrate one of his friends who was so call'd and who had been his Praeceptor says  Eustathius  I must add one remark that tho' he places his Master here in no very good company yet he guards his character from any imputation by telling us that he attended the Suitors by compulsion This is not only a great instance of his gratitude but also of his tenderness and delicacy  XXVIII  VERSE  All who deserv'd his choice    'Tis evident from this and many places in the  Iliad  that Hospitality was hereditary an happiness and honour peculiar to these heroic ages And surely nothing can set the character of  Ulysses  in a more  agreeable point of light than what  Telemachus  here delivers of it  "He was the friend of all mankind"  Eustathius  observes that  has a middle signification that it implies that  Ulysses  behav'd benevolently to all men or that all men behaved benevolently to  Ulysses  either sense makes  Ulysses  a very amiable person He must be a friend to all men to whom all men are friends  XXIX  VERSE  I steer my voyage to the  Brutian  strand    In the country of the  Brutians  in the lower part of  Italy  was a town call'd  Temese  That  Homer  here meant this city and not one of the same name in  Cyprus  appears not only because this was famous for works of brass but because as  Strabo  observes  Ithaca  lay in the direct way from  Taphos  to this city of the  Brutii  whereas it was considerably out of the way to pass by  Ithaca  to that of  Cyprus  The same Author says that the rooms for preparing of brass were remaining in his time tho' then out of use  Ovid Met    Hippotadaeque domos regis Temesesque metalla  And  Statius    Sylv  se totis Temese dedit hausta metallis  Bochart  is of opinion that the name of  Temese  was given to this town by the  Phenicians  from the brass it produced  Temes  in their language signifying Fusion of Metals an Art to which the  Phenicians  much apply'd themselves  Eustat Dacier  XXX  VERSE  Laertes  's Retirement    This most beautiful passage of  Laertes  has not escap'd the censure of the Critics they say  acts an unmanly part he forgets that he is a King and reduces himself unworthily into the condition of a servant  Eustathius  gives two reasons for his retirement which answer those objections the first is that he could not endure to see the outrage and insolence of the Suitors the second that his Grief for  Ulysses  makes him abandon society and prefer his vineyard to his Court This is undoubtedly the picture of human nature under affliction for sorrow loves solitude Thus it is as  Dacier  well observes that  Menedemus  in  Terence  laments his lost Son  Menedemus  is the Picture of  Laertes  Nor does it make any difference that the one is a King the other a person of private station Kings are but enobled humanity and are liable as other men to as great if not greater sensibility  The word    creeping  about his vineyard has also given offence as it carries an idea of meanness with it but  Eustathius  observes that it excellently expresses the melancholy of  Laertes  and denotes no meanness of spirit The same word is apply'd to the great  Achilles  in the  Iliad  when he laments at the Obsequies of  Patroclus  and  Horace  no doubt had it in his view  Tacitum sylvas interreptare salubreis  XXXI  VERSE  Among a savage race  c  It is the observation of  Eustathius  that what  Minerva  here delivers bears resemblance to the Oracles in which part is false part true That  Ulysses  is detain'd in an Island is a truth that he is detain'd by Barbarians a falshood This is done by the Goddess that she may be thought to be really a man as she appears to be she speaks with the dubiousness of a man not the certainty of a Goddess she raises his expectation by shewing she has an insight into futurity and to engage his belief she discovers in part the truth to  Telemachus  Neither was it necessary or convenient for  Telemachus  to know the whole truth for if he had known that  Ulysses  inhabited a desart detain'd by a Goddess he must of consequence  have known of his return for he that could certify the one could certify the other and so had never gone in search of him and it would hence have happen'd that  Homer  had been depriv'd of giving us those graces of Poetry which arise from the voyage of  Telemachus  Eustathius  XXXII  VERSE  To prove a genuine birth  c  There is an appearance of something very shocking in this speech of  Telemachus  It literally runs thus  My mother assures me that I am the son of  Ulysses  but I know it not  It seems to reflect upon his mother's chastity as if he had a doubt of his own legitimacy This seeming simplicity in  Telemachus  says  Eustathius  is the effect of a troubled spirit it is grief that makes him doubt if he can be the son of the great the generous  Ulysses  it is no reflection upon  Penelope  and consequently no fault in  Telemachus  It is an undoubted truth that the mother only knows the legitimacy of the child Thus  Euripides    that is The mother knows the child the father only believes it  Thus also  Menander    that is No man knows assuredly who begot him we only guess it and believe it  Aristotle  in his  Rhetoric  is also of this opinion  What I have here said is translated literally from  Eustathius  and if it edifies the Reader I am content But the meaning of the  passage is this  Mentes  asks  Telemachus  if he be the son of  Ulysses  he replies  "  So my mother assures me but nothing sure so wretched as I am could proceed from that great man  "  But however this may be reconciled to truth I believe few Ladies would take it as a compliment if their sons shou'd tell them there was some room to doubt of their legitimacy there may be abundance of truth in it and yet very little decency  XXXIII  VERSE  Now snatch'd by Harpies  c  The meaning of this expression is that  Ulysses  has not had the rites of sepulture This among the Ancients was esteem'd the greatest of calamities as it hinder'd the Shades of the deceased from entering into the state of the happy  XXXIV  VERSE  To tempt the spouseless Queenresort the Nobles    It is necessary to reconcile the conduct of the Suitors to probability since it has so great a share in the process of the  Odyssey  It may seem incredible that  Penelope  who is a Queen in whom the supreme power is lodg'd should not dismiss such unwelcome intruders especially since many of them were her own subjects Besides it seems an extraordinary way of courtship in them to ruin the person to whom they make their addresses  To solve this objection we must consider the nature of the  Grecian  governments The chief men of the land had great authority Tho' the government was monarchical it was not despotic  Laertes  was retir'd and disabled with age  Telemachus  was yet in his minority and the fear of any violence either against her own person or against her son might deter  Penelope  from using any endeavours to remove men of such insolence and such power  Dacier  XXXV  VERSE  To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart    It is necessary to explain this passage It seems at first view as if  Ulysses  had requested what a good man could not grant  Ilus  says  Mentes  deny'd the Poison because he fear'd the anger of the Gods and the poison it self is call'd by  Homer  as if it were design'd against mankind  Eustathius  defends  Ulysses  variously He intended says he to employ it against beasts only that infested his country or in hunting He assigns another reason and says that the Poet is preparing the way to give an air of probability to the destruction of the Suitors He poisons his arrows that every wound may be mortal on this account the poison may be call'd  for it is certain in the wars of  Troy  poison'd arrows were not in use for many persons who were wounded recover'd so that of necessity they must be reserv'd for domestic occasions From what has been said we may collect the reason why  Anchialus  granted the poison to  Ulysses  and  Ilus  deny'd it  Anchialus  was the friend of  Ulysses  and knew that he would not employ it to any ill purpose but  Ilus  who was a stranger to him was afraid lest he should abuse it  Eustathius  XXXVI  VERSE  Dismiss'd with honour let her hence repair    I will lay before the reader literally what  Eustathius  observes upon these words There is a Soloecism says he in these verses or words that cannot be reduc'd to the rules of construction It should be  not  How then comes the accusative case to be used instead of the nominative  Mentes  adds he may be suppos'd to have intended to have said  send thy Mother away but considering in the midst of the Sentence that such advice was not suitable to be given to  Telemachus  he checks himself and suppresses  and no other word immediately  occurring that requir'd an accusative case he falls into a Soloecism  But perhaps this is more ingenious than true tho'  Mentes  was in haste when he spoke it  Homer  was not when he compos'd it Might not an errour creep into the original by the negligence of a Transcriber who might write  for  This is the more probable because the one stands in the Verse in every respect as well as the other  What  Eustathius  adds is very absurd he says that  Telemachus  must observe both the interpretations either send thy Mother away or let thy Mother retire So that the advice was double send thy Mother away if thou dost not love her but if thou art unwilling to grieve her let her recess be voluntary  XXXVII  VERSE  Omen'd Voiceof  Jove  There is a difficulty in this Passage In any case of enquiry any Words that were heard by accident were call'd by the  Latins    Omens  by  Homer    the voice of Jupiter  and he stiles them so because it is thro' his providence that those words come to our knowledge  signifies  fame  or  rumour  and the Ancients refer'd all voices or sounds to  Jupiter  and still'd him  So that the  voice of Jove  implies any words that we hear by chance from whence we can draw any thing that gives light to our concerns or enquiries  Dacier Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  Hast thou not heard  c  It may seem that this example of  Orestes  does not come fully up to the purpose intended There is a wide difference in the circumstances  Orestes  slew an adulterer and a single person with an adulteress The designs of  Telemachus  are not against one but many enemies neither are they adulterers nor have they slain the father of  Telemachus  as is  the case of  Orestes  nor is  Penelope  an adulteress The intent therefore of the Goddess is only to shew what a glorious act it is to defend our parents  Orestes  says  Mentes  is every where celebrated for honouring his father and thou shalt obtain equal honour by defending thy mother  The sense that  here bears is remarkable it signifies not only a person who kills his own father but who kills the father of any other person  Eustathius  XXXIX  VERSE  With eaglespeed she cut the sky  Instant invisible    I pass over the several interpretations that have been given to the word  some say it implies she flew up the chimney  c  In reality it signifies a species of an eagle but it may also signifie the same as  invisible either of the latter senses are natural or both together  like an eagle she disappear'd  Eustathius  XL  VERSE  Hush'd in attention to the warbled song    There may be two reasons why this is inserted either the Suitors were pleas'd with the sweetness of the song or the subject of it they sate attentive to hear the death of  Ulysses  in the process of his story This gives us a reason why immediately  Penelope  descended to stop the song she fear'd lest he might touch upon the story of  Ulysses  and say that he dy'd in his return This would have reduc'd her to the utmost necessity and she could not have deferr'd to marry  Phemius  would have certainly found credit for Poets were believ'd to be inspir'd by the Gods they were look'd upon as Prophets and to have something of divinity in them as appears from  Demodocus  in the th book of the  Odyssey  Besides there was a further necessity to put a stop to the song If  Phemius  had declar'd him to be dead  Penelope  could not have avoided marriage if alive the Suitors might have desisted  or arm'd themselves against  Ulysses  and then their Deaths one of the principal incidents of the Poem could not have follow'd neither could  Telemachus  have gone in search of his father if he had foreknown his death or sudden return It is therefore artful in the Poet to cut the song short he reserves the story of  Ulysses  for future narration and brings all this about by a very probable method by the interposition of  Penelope  who requests that some other story may be chosen a story that she can hear without sorrow  It is very customary for women to be present at the entertainments of men as appears from the conduct of  Helen    Arete    Nausicaa  and  Penelope  in divers parts of the  Odyssey  She is here introduced with the greatest decency she enters not the room but stands with tears at the threshold and even at that distance appears with her face shaded by a veil  Eustathius  XLI  VERSE  Oft  Jove  's aetherial rays  c  Telemachus  here reproves his mother for commanding  Phemius  to desist or not to make  Ulysses  the subject of his song by saying that it was not in the Poet's own power to chuse his subject which was frequently dictated and inspired by the Gods This is a particular instance of the opinion the Ancients held as to the immediate inspiration of their Poets The words in the original evidently bear this sense  If the subject displease you 'tis not the Poet but  Jupiter  is to blame who inspires men of invention as he himself pleases  And Mad  Dacier  strangely mistakes this passage in rendring it  'tis not the Poet but  Jupiter  who is the cause of our misfortunes for 'tis he who dispenses to wretched mortals good or evil as he pleases  At the same time she acknowledges the word  which she here renders  laborious  or  wretched  to signify  persons of wit  in the beginning of  lib  and  persons of skill and ability in their art  in  lib    XLII  VERSE  Your widow'd hours apart with female toil  c  These verses are taken literally from the th book of the  Iliad  except that  is inserted instead of    Eustathius  explains the passage thus  Women are not forbid entirely to speak for women are talking animals  they have the faculty of talking and  indeed  are rational creatures  but they must  not give too much liberty to that unruly member in the company of men Sophocles  advises well  O woman silence is the ornament of thy sex  Madam  Dacier  tho' she plunders almost every thing has spared this observation  XLIII  VERSE  The speech of  Antinous  Antinous  and  Eurymachus  are  Ithacensians  and are call'd the chief of the Suitors It is therefore necessary to distinguish their characters  Antinous  is violent and determin'd against  Ulysses    Eurymachus  more gentle and subtle  Antinous  derides  Eurymachus  flatters  This speech of  Antinous  is a conceal'd raillery he tells  Telemachus  that  Jove  inspires his soul with wisdom but means that his education has been such that he had learn'd nothing from man he wishes out of a seemingly kind concern for him that he may never reign in  Ithaca  because the weight of a crown is a burthen and concludes with mentioning his hereditary title to it to insinuate that is his by descent only and not by merit  Telemachus  in his answer wisely dissembles the affront of  Antinous  he takes it in the better sense and seems to differ only in opinion about the Regality Think you says he that to be a King is to be miserable To be a King in my judgment is to  enjoy affluence and honour He asserts his claim to the succession of his father yet seems to decline it to lay the suspicions of the Suitors asleep that they may not prevent the measures he takes to obtain it  Eustathius  The speech of  Eurymachus  confirms the former observation that this Suitor is of a more soft and moderate behaviour than  Antinous  He cloaths ill designs with a seeming humanity and appears a friend while he carries on the part of an enemy  Telemachus  had said that if it was the will of  Jupiter  he would ascend the Throne of  Ithaca Eurymachus  answers that this was as the Gods shou'd determine an insinuation that they regarded not his claim from his father  Telemachus  said he would maintain himself in the possession of his present inheritance  Eurymachus  wishes that no one may arrive to dispossess him the latent meaning of which is  "we of your own country are sufficient for that design"  If these observations of  Eustathius  be true  Eurymachus  was not a less enemy than  Antinous  but a better dissembler  XLIV  VERSE  The sage  Euryclea  Euryclea  was a very aged person she was bought by  Laertes  to nurse  Ulysses  and in her old age attends  Telemachus  She cost  Laertes  twenty oxen that is a certain quantity of money  which would buy twenty oxen or perhaps the form of an ox was stamp'd upon the metal and from thence had its appellation  The simplicity of these Heroic times is remarkable an old woman is the only attendant upon the son of a King She lights him to his apartment takes care of his cloaths and hangs them up at the side of his bed Greatness then consisted not in shew but in the mind this conduct proceeded not from the meanness of poverty but from the simplicity of manners  Eustathius  Having now gone thro' the first book I shall only observe to the Reader that the whole of it does not take up the compass of an entire day When  Minerva  appears to  Telemachus  the Suitors were preparing to sit down to the banquet at noon and the  business of the first book concludes with the day It is true that the Gods hold a debate before the descent of  Minerva  and some small time must be allow'd for that transaction It is remarkable that there is not one Simile in this book except we allow those three words to be one  The same observation is true of the first book of the  Iliad  See the Notes on that place  THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  The ARGUMENT  The Council of  Ithaca  Telemachus  in the assembly of the Lords of  Ithaca  complains of the injustice done him by the Suitors and insists upon their departure from his Palace appealing to the Princes and exciting the people to declare against them The Suitors endeavour to justify their stay at least till he shall send the Queen to the Court of  Icarius  her father which he refuses There appears a prodigy of two Eagles in the sky which an Augur expounds to the ruin of the Suitors  Telemachus  then demands a vessel to carry him to  Pylos  and  Sparta  there to enquire of his father's fortunes  Pallas  in the shape of  Mentor  an ancient friend of  Ulysses  helps him to a ship assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage and embarks with him that night which concludes the  second  day from the Opening of the Poem  The SCENE continues in the Palace of  Ulysses  in  Ithaca  WK  PFourdrinier sc  THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  _NOW red'ning from the dawn the Morning ray  Glow'd in the front of Heav'n and gave the Day  The youthful Hero with returning light  Rose anxious from th'inquietudes of Night  A royal robe he wore with graceful pride  A twoedg'd faulchion threaten'd by his side  Embroider'd sandals glitter'd as he trod  And forth he mov'd majestic as a God  Then by his Heralds restless of delay  To council calls the Peers the Peers obey  Soon as in solemn form th' assembly sate  From his high dome himself descends in state  Bright in his hand a pond'rous javelin shin'd  Two Dogs a faithful guard attend behind  Pallas  with grace divine his form improves  And gazing crowds admire him as he moves  His Father's throne he fill'd while distant stood  The hoary Peers and Aged Wisdom bow'd  'Twas silence all at last  Aegyptius  spoke  Aegyptius  by his age and sorrows broke  A length of days his soul with prudence crown'd  A length of days had bent him to the ground  His eldest  Antiphus  hope in arms to  Ilion  came  By great  Ulysses  taught the path to fame  But hapless youth the hideous  Cyclops  tore  His quiv'ring limbs and quaff'd his spouting gore  Three sons remain'd To climb with haughty fires  The royal bed  Eurynomus  aspires  The rest with duteous love his griefs asswage  And ease the Sire of half the cares of age  Yet still his  Antiphus  he loves he mourns  And as he stood he spoke and wept by turns  Since great  Ulysses  sought the  Phrygian  plains  Within these walls inglorious silence reigns  Say then ye Peers by whose commands we meet  Why here once more in solemn council sit  Ye young ye old the weighty cause disclose  Arrives some message of invading foes  Or say does high necessity of state  Inspire some Patriot and demand debate  The present Synod speaks its author wise  Assist him  Jove  thou regent of the skies  He spoke  Telemachus  with transport glows  Embrac'd the omen and majestic rose  His royal hand th'imperial scepter sway'd  Then thus addressing to  Aegyptius  said  Rev'rend old man lo here confest he stands  By whom ye meet my grief your care demands  No story I unfold of public woes  Nor bear advices of impending foes  Peace the blest land and joys incessant crown  Of all this happy realm I grieve alone  For my lost Sire continual sorrows spring  The great the good your Father and your King  Yet more our house from its foundation bows  Our foes are pow'rful and your sons the foes  Hither unwelcome to the Queen they come  Why seek they not the rich  Icarian  dome  If she must wed from other hands require  The dowry Is  Telemachus  her Sire  Yet thro' my court the noise of Revel rings  And wastes the wise frugality of Kings  Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice  Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies  Safe in my youth in riot still they grow  Nor in the helpless Orphan dread a foe  But come it will the time when manhood grants  More pow'rful advocates than vain complaints  Approach that hour unsufferable wrong  Cries to the Gods and vengeance sleeps too long  Rise then ye Peers with virtuous anger rise  Your same revere but most th'avenging skies  By all the deathless pow'rs that reign above  By righteous  Themis  and by thund'ring  Jove      Themis  who gives to councils or denies  Success and humbles or confirms the wise  Rise in my aid suffice the tears that flow  For my lost Sire nor add new woe to woe  If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill  Or having pow'r to wrong betray'd the will  On me on me your kindled wrath asswage  And bid the voice of lawless riot rage  If ruin to our royal race ye doom  Be You the spoilers and our wealth consume  Then might we hope redress from juster laws  And raise all  Ithaca  to aid our cause  But while your Sons commit th' unpunish'd wrong  You make the Arm of Violence too strong  While thus he spoke with rage and grief he frown'd  And dash'd th'imperial sceptre to the ground  The big round tear hung trembling in his eye  The Synod griev'd and gave a pitying sigh  Then silent sateat length  Antinous  burns  With haughty rage and sternly thus returns  O insolence of youth whose tongue affords  Such railing eloquence and war of words  Studious thy country's worthies to defame  Thy erring voice displays thy Mother's shame  Elusive of the bridal day she gives  Fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives  Did not the sun thro' heav'n's wide azure roll'd  For three long years the royal fraud behold  While she laborious in delusion spread  The spacious loom and mix'd the various thread  Where as to life the wond'rous figures rise  Thus spoke th'inventive Queen with artful sighs  " Tho' cold in death  Ulysses  breathes no more  " Cease yet a while to urge the bridal hour  " Cease 'till to great  Laertes  I bequeath  " A task of grief his ornaments of death  " Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim  " The  Grecian  matrons taint my spotless fame  " When he whom living mighty realms obey'd  " Shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade  Thus she at once the gen'rous train complies  Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise  The work she ply'd but studious of delay  By night revers'd the labours of the day  While thrice the sun his annual journey made  The conscious lamp the midnight fraud survey'd  Unheard unseen three years her arts prevail  The fourth her maid unfolds th'amazing tale  We saw as unperceiv'd we took our stand  The backward labours of her faithless hand  Then urg'd she perfects her illustrious toils  A wond'rous monument of female wiles  But you oh Peers and thou oh Prince give ear  I speak aloud

Thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed  While yet he speaks  Telemachus  replies  Ev'n Nature starts and what ye ask denies  Thus shall I thus repay a mother's cares  Who gave me life and nurs'd my infant years  While sad on foreign shores  Ulysses  treads  Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades  How to  Icarius  in the bridal hour  Shall I by waste undone refund the dow'r  How from my father should I vengeance dread  How would my mother curse my hated head  And while in wrath to vengeful Fiends she cries  How from their hell would vengeful Fiends arise  Abhorr'd by all accurs'd my name would grow  The earth's disgrace and Humankind my foe  If this displease why urge ye here your stay  Haste from the court ye spoilers haste away  Waste in wild riot what your land allows  There ply the early feast and late carouse  But if to honour lost 'tis still decreed  For you my bowl shall flow my flocks shall bleed  Judge and assert my right impartial  Jove  By him and all th' immortal

eyes the rival train they threat  And shrieking loud denounce approaching fate  They cuff they tear their cheeks and necks they rend  And from their plumes huge drops of blood descend  Then failing o'er the domes and tow'rs they fly  Full tow'rd the east and mount into the sky  The wondring Rivals gaze with cares opprest  And chilling horrours freeze in every breast  'Till big with knowledge of approaching woes  The Prince of Augurs  Halitherses  rose  Prescient he view'd th' aerial tracts and drew  A sure presage from ev'ry wing that flew  Ye sons he cry'd of  Ithaca  give ear  Hear all but chiefly you oh Rivals hear  Destruction sure o'er all your heads impends  Ulysses  comes and death his steps attends  Nor to the Great alone is death decreed  We and our guilty  Ithaca  must bleed  Why cease we then the wrath of heav'n to stay  Be humbled all and lead ye Great the way  For lo my words no fancy'd woes relate  I speak from science and the voice is Fate  When great  Ulysses  sought

the Prince explores  The neighb'ring main and sorrowing treads the shores  There as the waters o'er his hands he shed  The royal suppliant to  Minerva  pray'd  O Goddess who descending from the skies  Vouchsaf'd thy presence to my wond'ring eyes  By whose commands the raging deeps I trace  And seek my sire thro' storms and rolling seas  Hear from thy heav'ns above oh warriormaid  Descend once more propitious to my aid  Without thy presence vain is thy command  Greece  and the rival train thy voice withstand  Indulgent to his pray'r the Goddess took  Sage  Mentor  's form and thus like  Mentor  spoke  O Prince in early youth divinely wise  Born the  Ulysses  of thy age to rise  If to the son the father's worth descends  O'er the wide waves success thy ways attends  To tread the walks of

The winged vessel studious I prepare  Thro' seas and realms companion of thy care  Thou to the court ascend and to the shores  When night advances bear the naval stores  Bread that decaying man with strength supplies  And gen'rous wine which thoughtful sorrow flies  Meanwhile the Mariners by my command  Shall speed aboard a valiant chosen band  Wide o'er the bay by vessel vessel rides  The best I chuse to waft thee o'er the tides  She spoke to his high dome the Prince returns  And as he moves with royal anguish mourns  'Twas riot all among the lawless train  Boar bled by boar and goat by goat lay slain  Arriv'd his hand the gay  Antinous  prest  And thus deriding with a smile addrest  Grieve not oh daring Prince that noble heart  Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part  Indulge the genial hour unbend thy soul  Leave thought to Age and drain the flowing bowl  Studious to ease thy grief our care provides  The bark to waft thee o'er the swelling tides  Is this returns the Prince

The wealth of Kings and made my youth a prey  But now the wise instructions of the sage  And manly thoughts inspir'd by manly age  Teach me to seek redress for all my woe  Here or in  Pyle  in  Pyle  or here your foe  Deny your vessels ye deny in vain  A private voyager I pass the main  Free breathe the winds and free the billows flow  And where on earth I live I live your foe  He spoke and frown'd nor longer deign'd to stay  Sternly his hand withdrew and strode away  Mean time o'er all the dome they quaff they feast  Derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest  And each in jovial mood his mate addrest  Tremble ye not oh friends and coward fly  Doom'd by the stern  Telemachus  to dye  To  Pyle  or  Sparta  to demand supplies  Big with revenge the mighty warrior flies  Or comes from  Ephyré  with poisons fraught  And kills us all in one tremendous draught  Or who can say his gamesome mate replies  But while the dangers of the deeps he tries  He like his sire may sink

thy lineage shar'd  And watch'd all night all day a faithful guard  To whom the Prince O thou whose guardian care  Nurs'd the most wretched King that breathes the air  Untouch'd and sacred may these

roaring seas divide  In foreign lands thy father's days decay'd  And foreign lands contain the mighty dead  The watry way illfated if thou try  All all must perish and by fraud you die  Then stay my child Storms beat and rolls the main  Oh beat those storms and roll the seas in vain  Far hence reply'd the Prince thy fears be driv'n  Heav'n calls me forth these counsels are of heav'n  But by the pow'rs that hate the perjur'd swear  To keep my voyage from the royal ear  Nor uncompell'd the dang'rous truth betray  'Till twice six times descends the lamp of day  Lest the sad tale a mother's life impair  And grief destroy what time a while would spare  Thus he The matron with uplifted eyes  Attests th' allseeing Sovereign of the skies  Then studious she prepares the choicest flour  The strength of wheat and wines an ample store  While to the rival train the Prince returns  The martial Goddess with impatience burns  Like thee  Telemachus  in voice and size  With speed divine from street to street she flies  She bids the Mariners prepar'd to stand  When Night descends embodyed on the strand  Then to  Noemon  swift she runs she flies  And asks a bark the chief a bark supplies  And now declining with his sloping wheels  Down sunk the Sun behind the western hills  The Goddess shov'd the vessel from the shores  And stow'd within its womb the naval stores  Full in the openings of the spacious main  It rides and now descends the sailor train  Next to the court impatient of delay  With rapid step the Goddess urg'd her way  There every eye with flumbrous chains she bound  And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground  Drowzy they rose with heavy fumes opprest  Reel'd from the palace and retir'd to rest  Then thus in  Mentor  's reverend form array'd  Spoke to  Telemachus  the martial Maid  Lo on the seas prepar'd the vessel stands  Th' impatient mariner thy speed demands  Swift as she spoke with rapid pace she leads  The footsteps of the Deity he treads  Swift to the shore they move Along the strand  The ready vessel rides the sailors ready stand  He bids them bring their stores th' attending train  Load the tall bark and launch into the main  The Prince and Goddess to the stern ascend  To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend  Full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow  The sable billows foam and roar below  The Chief his orders gives th'obedient band  With due observance wait the chief's command  With speed the mast they rear with speed unbind  The spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind  High o'er the roaring waves the spreading sails  Bow the tall mast and swell before the gales  The crooked keel the parting surge divides  And to the stern retreating roll the tides  And now they ship their oars and crown with wine  The holy Goblet to the pow'rs divine  Imploring all the Gods that reign above  But chief the blueey'd Progeny of  Jove  Thus all the night they stem the liquid way  And end their voyage with the morning ray  WK  PFsc  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND BOOK  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND BOOK  I  _THIS book opens with the first appearance of  Telemachus  upon the stage of action And  Bossu  observes the great judgment of the Poet in beginning with the transactions of  Ithaca  in the absence of  Ulysses  By this method he sets the conduct of  Telemachus    Penelope  and the Suitors in a strong point of light they all have a large share in the story of the Poem and consequently ought to have distinguishing characters It is as necessary in Epic Poetry as it is on the Theatre to let us immediately into the character of every person whom the Poet introduces This adds perspicuity to the story and we immediately grow acquainted with each personage and interest our selves in the good or ill fortune that attends them thro' the whole relation  Telemachus  is now about twenty years of age In the eleventh book the Poet tells us he was an infant in the arms of his mother when  Ulysses  sail'd to  Troy  that Heroe was absent near twenty  years and from hence we may gather the exact age of  Telemachus  He is every where describ'd as a person of piety to the Gods of duty to his parents and as a lover of his country he is prudent temperate and valiant and the Poet well sets off the importance of this young Heroe by giving him the Goddess of War and Wisdom for his constant attendant  II  VERSE  In his hand a pond'rous javelin shin'd    The Poet describes  Telemachus  as if he were marching against an enemy or going to a council of war rather than to an assembly of Peers in his own country Two reasons are assign'd for this conduct either this was the common usage of Princes in those times or  Telemachus  might look upon the Suitors as enemies and consequently go to council in arms as against enemies  Eustathius  III  VERSE  Two Dogs a faithful guard attend behind    This passage has not escap'd the raillery of the Critics they look upon it as a mean description of a Heroe and a Prince to give him a brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants But such was the simplicity of ancient Princes that except in war they had rarely any attendants or equipage And we may be confident  Homer  copies after the custom of the time unless we can be so absurd as to suppose he would feign low circumstances unnecessarily thro' a want of judgment  Virgil  judg'd otherwise and thought this circumstance worthy of his imitation  Quin etiam gemini custodes limine ab alto  Procedunt gressumque canes comitantur Herilem  Achiles  is describ'd in the  Iliad  with the same attendants  Nine large dogs domestic at his board  B  Poetry observes  Dacier  is like Painting which draws the greatest beauties from the simplest customs and even in history we receive a sensible pleasure from the least circumstance that denotes the customs of ancient times It may be added that the Poet as well as the Painter is obliged to follow the customs of the age of which he writes or paints a modern dress would ill become  Achilles  or  Ulysses  such a conduct would be condemned as an absurdity in painting and ought to be so in poetry  IV  VERSE  Yet still his  Antiphus  he loves he mourns    Homer  says  Eustathius  inserts these particularities concerning the family of  Aegyptius  to give an air of truth to his story It does not appear that  Aegyptius  knew the certainty of the death of  Antiphus  for it is the Poet who relates it and not the father whence as  Dacier  observes should he learn it he only laments him according to the prevailing opinion that all the companions of  Ulysses  were lost with  Ulysses  V  VERSE  Since great  Ulysses  c    We are here told that there never had been any council conven'd in  Ithaca  since the departure of  Ulysses  The general design and moral of the  Odyssey  is to inform us of the mischievous effects which the Absence of a King and Father of a family produces We deprive as  Bossu  observes the Poem of its very soul and spoil the Fable if we retrench from it the disorders which the Suitors create in the absence of  Ulysses  both in his family and dominions Nothing can give us a greater image of those disorders than what  is here related What must a kingdom suffer in twenty years without a Ruler without a Council to make Laws or punish enormities Such is the condition of  Ithaca Laertes  is superannuated  Penelope  oppress'd by the violence of the Suitors and  Telemachus  to this time in his minority  It is very artful in the Poet to open the assembly by  Aegyptius Telemachus  was the person who conven'd it and being the greatest personage present it might be expected that he should open the design of it But to give  Telemachus  courage who was young and inexperienc'd  Aegyptius  first rises and by praising the person who had summon'd them of whom he seems ignorant gives  Telemachus  to understand he has friends among the assembly This he could no other way so safely have done considering the power of the Suitors By this means  Telemachus  is encouraged to speak boldly and arraign the disorders of the Suitors with the utmost freedom  VI  VERSE  Your Father and your King    Telemachus  here sets the character of  Ulysses  as a King in the most agreeable point of light He rul'd his people with the same mildness as a father rules his children This must needs have a very happy effect upon the audience not only as it shews  Ulysses  to have been a good Governour but as it recalls the memory of the happiness they receiv'd from that mild government and obliquely condemns them of ingratitude who had forgot it By this method also the Poet interests us deeply in the sufferings of  Ulysses  we cannot see a good man and good King in distress without the most tender emotions  VII  VERSE  Yet moreour house  c  What  Telemachus  here says has given offence to the Critics they think it indecent for a son to say that he bears with more regret  the disorder of his family than the loss of his father yet this objection will vanish if we weigh  Penelope    Telemachus  and his whole posterity against the single person of  Ulysses  But what chiefly takes away this objection is that  Telemachus  was still in hopes of his father's return for  does not imply necessarily his death but absence and then both with justice and decency  Telemachus  may say that he grieves more for the destruction of his family than for the absence of  Ulysses  VIII  VERSE  Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice    This passage is ridicul'd by the Critics they set it in a wrong light and then grow very pleasant upon it  Telemachus  makes a sad outcry because the Suitors eat his sheep his beeves and fatted goats and at last falls into tears The truth is the riches of Kings and Princes in those early ages consisted chiefly in flocks and cattle thus  Aeneas  and  Paris  are describ'd as tending their flocks  c  and  Abraham  in the scriptures as abounding in this kind of wealth  These Critics would form a different idea of the state and condition of  Telemachus  if they consider'd that he had been capable to maintain no fewer than an hundred and eight persons in a manner very expensive for many years for so many with their attendants were the Suitors as appears from the th book and at the same time he kept up the dignity of his own court and liv'd with great hospitality  But it is a sufficient answer to the objections against this passage to observe that it is not the expence but manner of it that  Telemachus  laments This he expresly declares by the word  and surely a sober man may complain against luxury without being arraigned of meanness and against profusion without being condemned for parsimony  IX  VERSE  Themis  who gives to Councils or denies  Success    Eustathius  observes that there was a custom to carry the statue of  Themis  to the assemblies in former ages and carry it back again when those assemblies were dissolv'd and thus  Themis  may be said to form and dissolve an assembly  Dacier  dislikes this assertion as having no foundation in antiquity she thinks that the assertion of  Telemachus  is general that he intimates it is Justice alone that establishes the councils of mankind and that Injustice confounds and brings the wicked designs of men to confusion  I have follow'd this interpretation not only as it suits best with the usual morality of  Homer  but also as  Jupiter  is mention'd with  Themis  and no such custom is pretended concerning his statue He is expresly stil'd by the ancients  In  Sicily  there was an Altar of  or of  Jupiter who presides over Councils Eustathius  from  Herodotus  X  VERSE  Be You the spoilers and our wealth consume    To understand this passage we must remember as  Eustathius  remarks that  Telemachus  is pleading his cause before the  Ithacensians  them he constitutes the Judges of his cause He therefore prevents an answer which they might make  viz We are not the men that are guilty of these outrages    Telemachus  rejoins  "It were better for me to suffer from your hands for by your quiescence you make my affairs desperate"  an intimation that they should rise in his defence  XI  VERSE  The big round tear hung trembling in his eye    This passage is not one of those where the Poet can be blam'd for causing  a Heroe to weep If we consider the youth of  Telemachus  together with the tenderness agreeable to that time of life the subjects that demand his concern the apprehension of the loss of a father and the desolate state of his mother and kingdom All these make his readiness to burst into tears an argument not of any want of spirit in him but of true sense and goodness of nature and is a great propriety which shews the right judgment of the Poet  XII  VERSE  Oh insolence of youth  c  We find  Antinous  always setting himself in the strongest opposition to  Telemachus  and therefore he is the first that falls by the spear of  Ulysses  the Poet observes justice and as  Antinous  is the first in guilt he is the first in punishment What  Antinous  says in this speech concerning the treachery of the female servant of  Penelope  prepares the way for the punishment  Ulysses  inflicts on some of the maids in the conclusion of the Poem This is an act of Poetical justice and it is as necessary in Epic as in Tragic Poetry to reward the just and punish the guilty  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  Elusive of the bridal day she gives  Fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives  It will be necessary to vindicate the character of  Penelope  the Heroine of the Poem from the aspersions of  Antinous  It must be confest that she has a very hard game to play she neither dares consent nor deny if she consents she injures  Ulysses  whom she still expects to return if she denies she endangers the Throne and the life of  Telemachus  from the violence of the Suitors so that no other method is left but to elude their addresses  I must not conceal what  Eustathius  has mention'd from some Authors as  Lycophron    c  who say that  Penelope  was  in plain  English    an Harlot  and he quotes  Herodotus  as affirming that she  had a son named  Pan  by  Hermes  but the Bishop declares it is all a scandal and every body must conclude the same from her conduct as describ'd in  Homer  To vindicate her in this place we must consider who it is that speaks  Antinous  an unsuccessful Lover and what he blames as a crime is really her glory he blames her because she does not comply with their desires and it had been an act of guilt to have comply'd He himself sufficiently vindicates her in the conclusion of his speech where he extols her above all the race of womankind so that the seeming inconsistence of  Penelope  must be imputed to the necessity of her affairs she is artful but not criminal  The original says she deceiv'd the Suitors by her messages a plain intimation that she us'd no extraordinary familiarities with her Admirers and thro' the whole course of the Poem she seldom appears in their Assemblies  XIV  VERSE  Cease 'till to great  Laertes  I bequeath  A task of grief his ornaments of death  It was an ancient custom to dedicate the finest pieces of Weaving and Embroidery to honour the funerals of the dead and these were usually wrought by the nearest relations in their lifetime Thus in the d  Iliad    Andromache  laments that the body of  Hector  must be exposed to the air without those ornaments    And the mother of  Euryalus  in  Virgil  to her son  Nec te tua funera mater  Produxi pressive oculos aut vulnera lavi  Veste tegens tibi quam noctes festina diesque  Urgebam tela curas solabar aniles  XV  VERSE  She shines with fatal excellence to thee    Eustathius  observes that  Antinous  in the opening of his Speech throws the fault upon  Penelope  to engage the favour of the multitude But being conscious that he had said things which  Penelope  would resent he extols her in the conclusion of it He ascribes an obstinacy of virtue to her and by this double conduct endeavours to make both  Penelope  and the multitude his friends  XVI  VERSE  Telemachus  's reply    Telemachus  every where speaks with an openness and bravery of spirit this speech is a testimony of it as well as his former he answers chiefly to the dismission of  Penelope  says it would be an offence against Heaven and Earth and concludes with a vehemence of expression and tells  Antinous  that such a word  shall never fall from his tongue  The Critics have found fault with one part of the speech as betraying a spirit of avarice and meanness in  Telemachus  How to  Icarius  in the bridal hour  Shall I by waste undone refund the dow'r  They think it unworthy of  Telemachus  to make the Dower of  Penelope  an argument against her dismission and consequently ascribe his detention of her not to duty but to covetousness To take away this objection they point the verses in a different manner and place a stop after  and then the sense runs thus  "I cannot consent to dismiss her who bore me and nurs'd me in my infancy while her husband is absent or perhaps dead besides hard would be the Punishment I should suffer if I should voluntarily send away  Penelope  to  Icarius  "  Dacier  dislikes this solution and appeals to the customs of those Ages to justify her opinion If a son forc'd away his mother from his house he was obliged to restore her dower and all she brought in marriage to her husband But if she retir'd voluntarily to engage in a second marriage the dower remain'd with the son as lawful heir This opinion of  Dacier  may be confirm'd from  Demosthenes  in his orations    Afterwards upon the decease of her husband leaving his family and receiving back her portion  c The same Author adds that the reason why the Suitors are so urgent to send away  Penelope  is that she may chuse to marry some one of them rather than return to  Icarius  so that  Telemachus  only takes hold of their argument for her dismission in order to detain her They address'd  Penelope  more for the sake of her riches than her beauty for she must be about forty years old and he tells them that if he sends her away against her consent he must restore those riches which they covet more than the person of  Penelope  This I confess is very refin'd and perhaps it may be sufficient to take off the objection of covetousness in  Telemachus  to understand no more than what the words at the first view seem to imply  viz  an abhorrence of their riots describ'd by  Telemachus  to have risen to such a degree as to have almost ruin'd his kingdom and made their demands impossible I see nothing unnatural or mean in this interpretation especially if we remember that the prodigious disorders of his family enter into the essence of the Poem The greater the disorders are the greater are the sufferings of  Ulysses  XVII  VERSE  How from my father should I vengeance dread    There is an ambiguity in the word Father it may either signify  Icarius  or  Ulysses  as  Eustathius  observes but I think the context determines the person to be  Ulysses  for  Telemachus  believes him to be yet living and consequently might fear his vengeance if he offer'd any indignity to  Penelope  XVIII  VERSE  And while in wrath to vengeful Fiends she cries  How from their hell would vengeful Fiends arise    In the ninth  Iliad  we are told that the father of  Phaenix  imprecated the Furies against his son  My sire with curses loads my hated head  And cries  "  Ye Furies barren be his bed  Infernal  Jove  the vengeful Fiends below  And ruthless  Proserpine  confirm'd his vow  In the same book the Furies hear the curses of  Althea  upon her son  She beat the ground and call'd the Pow'rs beneath  On her own son to wreak her brother's death  Hell heard her curses from the realms profound  And the fell Fiends who walk the nightly round  These passages shew the opinion the Ancients had of the honour due from children to parents to be such that they believ'd there were Furies particularly commission'd to punish those who fail'd in that respect and to fullfil the imprecations made against 'em by their offended parents There is a greatness in this Idea and it must have had an effect upon the obedience of the youth We see  Telemachus  is full of the sense of it  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  c  The Prodigy of the two Eagles    This prodigy is usher'd in very magnificently and the verses are lofty and sonorous The Eagles are  Ulysses  and  Telemachus    By  Jove  's command  they fly  from a mountain's height  this denotes that the two Heroes are inspir'd by  Jupiter  and come from the country to the destruction of the Suitors The eagles fly  with wing to wing conjoyn'd  this shews that they act in concert and unity of councils At first they  float upon the wind  this implies the calmness and secresy of the approach of those Heroes At last they  clang their wings and hovering beat the skies  this shews the violence of the assault  With ardent eyes the rival train they threat  This as the Poet himself interprets it denotes the approaching fate of the Suitors  Then failing o'er the domes and tow'rs they fly Full toward the east  this signifies that the Suitors alone are not doom'd to destruction but that the men of  Ithaca  are involv'd in danger as  Halitherses  interprets it  Nor to the Great alone is death decreed  We and our guilty  Ithaca  must bleed  See here the natural explication of this prodigy which is very ingenious  Eustathius    verbatim  XX  VERSE  I see I cry'd his woes  I see his friends o'erwhelm'd  c  In three lines observes  Eustathius  the Poet gives us the whole  Odyssey  in Miniature And it is wonderful to think that so plain a subject should produce such variety in the process of it  Aristotle  observes the simplicity of  Homer  's platform which is no more than this A Prince is absent from his country  Neptune  destroys his companions in his absence his family is disorder'd by many Princes that address his wife and plot against the life of his only son but at last after many storms he returns punishes the Suitors and reestablishes his affairs This is all that is essential to the Poem the rest of it is made up of Episodes And yet with  what miracles of Poetry  speciosa miracula  as  Horace  stiles them has he furnish'd out his Poem  XXI  VERSE  The speech of  Eurymachus  It has been observ'd that  Homer  is the father of Oratory as well as Poetry and it must be confess'd that there is not any one branch of it that is not to be found in his Poetry The Invective Persuasive Ironical  c  may all be gather'd from it Nothing can be better adapted to the purpose than this speech of  Eurymachus  He is to decry the credit of the predictions of  Halitherses  he derides he threats and describes him as a venal Prophet He is speaking to the multitude and endeavours to bring  Halitherses  into contempt and in order to it he uses him contemptuously  XXII  VERSE  all the  Greeks  have heard my wrongs    It is necessary for the Reader to carry in his mind that this Assembly consists not only of the Peers but of the People of  Ithaca  For to the People  Telemachus  here appeals  It is evident that the place of the Assembly was at least open to the Air in the upper parts for otherways how should the Eagles be visible to the Suitors and so very plainly as to be discover'd to threat them with their eyes There was no doubt a place set apart for Council usually in the market For  Telemachus  is said to seat himself in his Father's throne in the beginning of this book But  Ulysses  had been absent twenty years and therefore it is evident that his throne had stood in the same place for the space of twenty years It is past contradiction that in  Athens  and other cities of  Greece  there were  public Halls for the consultation of affairs  XXIII  VERSE  Mentor  arose  Ulysses'  faithful friend    The name of  Mentor  is another instance of the gratitude of our Poet's temper it being the same which belong'd to a friend of his by whom he was entertain'd in  Ithaca  during a defluxion on his eyes which seiz'd him in his voyages and at whose house he is said to have laid the plan of this Poem This character of  Mentor  is well sustain'd by his speech and by the assistance he gratefully gives to young  Telemachus  on all occasions  XXIV  VERSE  Guard thou my Sire and his behests obey    The original says only  "  Obey the old man  Eustathius  rightly determines that the expression means  Laertes  The Poet loses no opportunity of giving  Ulysses  an excellent character this is as necessary as continually to repeat the disorders of the Suitors  Servetur ad imum  Qualis ab incoepto processerit sibi constet  This conduct contributes admirably to the design of the Poem and when the Poet in the unravelling of his Fable comes to reward and punish the chief actors we acknowledge his justice in the death of the Suitors and reestablishment of  Ulysses  XXV  VERSE  While the bowl circles and the banquet warms    The original is not without obscurity it says  or  in the time of the banquet Eustathius  interprets it    The Wine as it were fighting on their side  and this agrees with what follows  The design of this speech is to deter the people of  Ithaca  from rising in the cause of  Ulysses    Mentor  speaks justly  Leocritus  insolently  Mentor  sets before them the worth of  Ulysses    Leocritus  the power of the Suitors  Mentor  speaks like a brave man  Leocritus  observes  Eustathius  like a coward who wanting true courage flies to the assistance of wine to raise a false one  Perhaps it may be objected that there is not a sufficient distinction in the characters of the several Suitors they are all describ'd as insolent voluptuaries But tho' they agree in this general character yet there is something distinguishing in the particular persons Thus  Antinous  derides  Eurymachus  covers villany with mildness  Antinous  is ever the foremost in outrage  Eurymachus  generally his second A greater distinction is neither necessary nor possible to be represented What the Poet is to describe is the insolence of the Suitors and the disorders they create in his family and kingdom he is oblig'd to dwell upon these circumstances because they are essential to his design and consequently that general resemblance of their characters is not a fault in the Poet  XXVI  VERSE  Then with a rushing sound  c  The Assembly which was conven'd by  Telemachus  is broke up in a riotous manner by  Leocritus  who had no right to dissolve it This agrees with the lawless state of the country in the absence of its King and shews says  Eustathius  that the Suitors had usurp'd the chief Authority  There is a fine contraste between the behaviour of  Telemachus  and that of the Suitors They return to repeat their disorders and debauches  Telemachus  retires to supplicate the Goddess of Wisdom to assist him in his enterprizes Thus the Poet raises the character of  Telemachus  he has shew'd him to be a youth of a brave spirit a good Speaker and here represents him as a person of piety  XXVII  VERSE  The speech of  Minerva  This speech of  Minerva  is suited to encourage a young man to imitate the virtue of his father and not to suffer himself to be overcome by any appearance of difficulties She sets his father before his eyes and tells him there was never any danger which he durst not encounter if he should suffer himself to be discouraged he would prove himself an unworthy son of a brave Father  Dacier Eustathius  XXVIII  VERSE  Antinous  's speech    This speech must be understood ironically  is us'd as before and has relation to the preceding harangues of  Telemachus  to the people and his intended voyage by way of derision  Antinous  bids him not trouble his brave Spirit in contriving any more Orations or in any bold attempt to find out  Ulysses  or to act the Orator or Heroe's part  The Critics have almost generally condemn'd these pieces of gayety and raillery as unworthy of heroic Poetry if ever they are proper they must be so in the mouths of these Suitors persons of no serious or noble characters Mirth wine and feasting is their constant employment and consequently if they fall into absurdities they act suitably to their characters  Milton  the best and greatest imitator of  Homer  has followed him unworthily in this respect I mean has debased even this low raillery into greater lowness by playing upon words and syllables But in this place the raillery is not without its effect by shewing the utmost contempt of  Telemachus  and surely it is the lowest degree of calamity to be at once oppress'd and despis'd  XXIX  VERSE  To  Pyle  or  Sparta  to demand supplies    It is observable says  Eustathius  that the Poet had in his choice several  expedients to bring about the destruction of the Suitors but he rejects them and chuses the most difficult method out of reverence to truth being unwilling to falsify the Histories of  Sparta  and  Pylos  This has a double effect it furnishes the Poet with a series of noble incidents and also gives an air of probability to the story of  Ulysses  and  Telemachus  XXX  VERSE  The royal Palace to the Queen convey    The Suitors allot the Palace to  Penelope  it being says  Eustathius  the only thing that they cannot consume and adds that the expression of the Suitors concerning the labour they should undergo in dividing the substance of  Ulysses  shews the wealth and abundance of that Heroe  Dacier  has found out an allusion between  in the first speech and  in the second they differing only in one letter She calls this a beauty which she laments she cannot preserve in her translation She is the only Commentator that ever was quicksighted enough to make the discovery The words have no relation they stand at a sufficient distance and I believe  Homer  would have thought such trifling unworthy of his Poetry So that all the honour which accrues from that observation must be ascrib'd in this case as in many others to the Commentator and not the Author  XXXI  VERSE  Where lay the treasures of th'  Ithacian  race    Such passages as these have ever furnish'd Critics with matter of raillery They think such houshold cares unworthy of a King and that this conduct suits better with vulgar persons of less fortune I confess such descriptions now would be ridiculous in a Poet because unsuitable to our manners But if we look upon such passages as pictures and exact representations of the old world the Reader will find a sensible pleasure in them  It is a true observation that the  Iliad  is chiefly suitable to the condition of Kings and Heroes and consequently fill'd with circumstances in which the greatest part of mankind can have no concern or interest The  Odyssey  is of more general use the story of it is a series of calamities which concern every man as every man may feel them We can bring the sufferings of  Ulysses  in some degree home to our selves and make his condition our own but what private person can ever be in the circumstances of  Agamemnon  or  Achilles  What I would infer from this is that the Reader ought not to take offence at any such descriptions which are only mean as they differ from the fashions of the latter ages In the  Iliad    Achilles  when he acts in the common offices of life and not as an Heroe is liable to the same objection But if the manners of the antient ages be consider'd we shall be reconcil'd to the actions of the antient Heroes and consequently to  Homer  XXXII  VERSE  Oh thou whose guardian care  Nurs'd the most wretched King    Euryclea  was not properly the Nurse of  Telemachus  but of  Ulysses  so that she is call'd so not in a strict sense but as one concern'd in his education from his infancy and as a general appellation of honour  Telemachus  here reserves the best wines for  Ulysses  a lesson observes  Eustathius  that even in the smallest matters we ought to pay a deference to our parents These occasional and seeminglytrivial circumstances are not without their use if not as poetical ornaments yet as moral instructions  XXXIII  VERSE  'Till twice six times descends the lamp of day    It may be demanded how it was probable if possible that the departure of  Telemachus  could be conceal'd twelve days from the knowledge of so fond a mother as  Penelope  It must be allow'd  that this would not be possible except in a time of such great disorder as the Suitors created  Penelope  confin'd herself almost continually within her own apartment and very seldom appear'd publickly so that there is no improbability in this relation  Dacier  It may be added that tho'  Telemachus  enjoyn'd secrecy for twelve days yet he intended a very speedy return and we find that he actually return'd in a much shorter space than twelve days so that the strictness of the injunction proceeds solely from filial love and was only cautionary against accidents that might detain him longer  Eustathius  makes a criticism upon the words  and  the former is used negatively the latter affirmatively namely the former in swearing  not to perform  a thing the latter  to perform it  XXXIV  VERSE  She bids the Mariners  c  It is probable that this passage of  Minerva  preparing the Mariners  c  is thus to be understood The men of  Ithaca  retaining in memory the speech of  Telemachus  and believing that what he then said and now requests was agreeable to justice and having as it were his image graven upon their hearts voluntarily resolve to lend him assistance So that  Minerva  is to be taken allegorically to imply that it was every person's own Reason that induced him to assist  Telemachus  Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE  Noemon  the Bark supplies    It may be ask'd why this particularity is necessary and may it not be thought that such a little circumstance is insignificant The answer is that a great deal depends upon this particularity no less than the discovery of the voyage of  Telemachus  to the Suitors and consequently whatever the Suitors act in order to intercept him takes its rise from  this little incident the fountain is indeed small but a large stream of Poetry flows from it  XXXVI  VERSE  There every eye with flumbrous chains she bound    The words in the original are  and  which are not to be taken for being  asleep  but  drowzy  this is evident from the usage of  in the conclusion of the first book of the  Iliad  where the signification has been mistaken by most translators They make  Jupiter  there to be asleep tho' two lines afterwards in the second book  Homer  expresly says  Th' Immortals slumber'd on their thrones above  All but the everwaking eyes of  Jove  It may be ask'd how  Minerva  can be said to occasion this drowziness in the Suitors and make them retire sooner than usual  Eustathius  replies that the person who furnish'd the wine supply'd it in greater quantities than ordinary thro' which wine they contracted a drowziness In this sense  Minerva  or Wisdom may be said to assist the designs of  Telemachus  XXXVII  VERSE  She bids fresh breezes blow    This also is an allegory and implies that the sailors had the experience and art to guide the ship before the winds but Poetry that delights to raise every circumstance exalts it into the marvellous and ascribes it to the Goddess of Wisdom  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  With speed the mast they rear  c  It is observable that  Homer  never passes by an opportunity of describing  the sea or a ship under sail and in many other places as well as in this he dwells largely upon it I take the reason to be not only because it furnish'd him with variety of poetical images but because he himself having made frequent voyages had a full Idea of it and consequently was delighted with it This is evident from his conduct in the  Iliad  were variety of allusions and similitudes are drawn from the Sea and are not the smallest ornaments of his Poetry  XXXIX  VERSE  And crown with wine  The holy Goblet to the Pow'rs divine    This custom of libations was frequent upon all solemn occasions before meat before sleep voyages journies and in all religious rites sacrifices  c  They were always made with wine pure and unmix'd whence  is a word frequent in antient Authors Sometimes they used mixed wine in Sacrifices but  Eustathius  says that this mixture was of wine with wine and not of wine with water hence came the distinction of  and  the unlawful and lawful libation wine unmix'd was lawful the mix'd unlawful  Homer  in this place uses  or  Goblets crown'd with wine  that is fill'd 'till the wine stood above the brim of the Goblet they esteem'd it an irreverence to the Gods not to fill the cups full for then only they esteem'd the libation  whole  and  perfect    and then only worthy of the Gods  This Book takes up the space of one day and one night it opens with the morning the speeches in the Council with the preparations for the voyage of  Telemachus  are the subject of the day and the voyage is finish'd by the next morning By this last circumstance we may learn that  Ithaca  was distant from  Pylos  but one night's voyage nay something less there being some time spent after the setting of the Sun in carrying the provisions from the Palace to the vessel  The book consists chiefly in the speeches of  Telemachus  and his friends against those of the Suitors It shews the great judgment of the Poet in chusing this method hence we see the causes preceding the effects and know from what spring every action flow'd we are never at a loss for a reason for every incident the speeches are as it were the groundwork upon which he builds all that relates to the adventures of  Telemachus  In the  Iliad  after the dissolution of the Council in the first book and the dissension between  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  we immediately see upon what hinge the fable turns So in the  Odyssey  after the Poet has laid before us the warm debates between the Suitors and  Telemachus  we immediately expect them to act as enemies The war is declar'd and we become judges as well as spectators of the scenes of action Thus  Homer  adds the perspicuity of History to the ornaments of Poetry  THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  The ARGUMENT  The Interview of  Telemachus  and  Nestor  Telemachus  guided by  Pallas  in the shape of  Mentor  arrives in the morning at  Pylos  where  Nestor  and his sons are sacrificing on the seashore to  Neptune Telemachus  declares the occasion of his coming and  Nestor  relates what past in their return from  Troy  how their fleets were separated and he never since heard of  Ulysses  They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon the revenge of  Orestes  and the injuries of the Suitors  Nestor  advises him to go to  Sparta  and enquire further of  Menelaus  The sacrifice ending with the night  Minerva  vanishes from them in the form of an Eagle  Telemachus  is lodged in the Palace The next morning they sacrifice a Bullock to  Minerva  and  Telemachus  proceeds on his journey to  Sparta  attended by  Pisistratus  The Scene lies on the seashore of  Pylos  WK  PFsc  THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  _THE sacred Sun above the waters rais'd  Thro' Heav'ns eternal brazen portals blaz'd  And wide o'er earth diffus'd his chearing ray  To Gods and men to give the golden day  Now on the coast of  Pyle  the vessel falls  Before old  Neleus  ' venerable walls  There suppliant to the Monarch of the flood  At nine green Theatres the  Pylians  stood  Each held five hundred a deputed train  At each nine oxen on the sand lay slain  They taste the entrails and the altars load  With smoaking thighs an offering to the God  Full for the port the  Ithacensians  stand  And furl their sails and issue on the land  Telemachus  already prest the shore  Not first the Pow'r of Wisdom march'd before  And ere the sacrificing throng he join'd  Admonish'd thus his wellattending mind  Proceed my son this youthful shame expel  An honest business never blush to tell  To learn what fates thy wretched

For Wisdom never lies  Oh tell me  Mentor  tell me faithful guide  The youth with prudent modesty reply'd  How shall I meet or how accost the Sage  Unskill'd in speech nor yet mature of age  Awful

heav'nly pow'r  Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour  For nought unprosp'rous shall thy ways attend  Born with good omens and with heav'n thy friend  She spoke and led the way with swiftest speed  As swift the youth pursu'd the way she led  And join'd the band before the sacred fire  Where sate encompast with his sons the Sire  The youth of  Pylos  some on pointed wood  Transfix'd the fragments some prepar'd the food  In friendly throngs they gather to embrace  Their unknown guests and at the banquet place  Pisistratus  was first to grasp their hands  And spread soft hydes upon the yellow sands  Along the shore th'illustrious pair he led  Where  Nestor  sate with youthful  Thrasymed  To each a portion of the Feast he bore  And held the golden goblet foaming o'er  Then first approaching to the elder guest  The latent Goddess in these words addrest  Whoe'er thou art whom fortune brings to keep  These rites of  Neptune  monarch of the deep  Thee first it fits oh stranger to

coast we came  Oh grace and glory of the  Grecian  name  From where high  Ithaca  o'erlooks the floods  Brown with o'erarching shades and pendent woods  Us to these shores our filial duty draws  A private sorrow not a publick cause  My sire I seek wheree'er the voice of fame  Has told the glories of his noble name  The great  Ulysses  fam'd from shore to shore  For valour much for hardy suff'ring more  Long time with thee before proud  Ilion  's wall  In arms he fought with thee beheld her fall  Of all the Chiefs this Heroe's fate alone  Has  Jove  reserv'd unheard of and unknown  Whether in fields by hostile fury slain  Or sunk by tempests in the gulphy main  Of this to learn opprest with tender fears  Lo at thy knee his suppliant son appears  If or thy certain eye or curious

thy mind thro' backward time can see  Search all thy stores of faithful memory  'Tis sacred truth I ask and ask of thee  To him experienc'd  Nestor  thus rejoin'd  O friend what sorrows dost thou bring to mind  Shall I the long laborious scenes review  And open all the wounds of  Greece  anew  What toils by sea where dark in quest of prey  Dauntless we rov'd  Achilles  led the way  What toils by land where mixt in fatal fight  Such numbers fell such Heroes sunk to night  There  Ajax  great  Achilles  there the brave  There wise  Patroclus  fill an early grave  There too my sonah once my best delight  Once swift of foot and terrible in fight  In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd  A faultless body and a blameless mind  Antilochus  what more can I relate  How trace the tedious series of our fate  Not added years on years my task could close  The long historian of my country's woes  Back to thy native Islands might'st thou sail  And leave halfheard the melancholy tale  Nine painful years on that detested shore  What stratagems we form'd what toils we bore  Still lab'ring on 'till scarce at last we found  Great  Jove  propitious and our conquest crown'd  Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shin'd  In wit in prudence and in force of mind  Art thou the son of that illustrious sire  With joy I grasp thee and with love admire  So like your voices and your words so wise  Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes  Thy Sire and I were one nor vary'd aught  In publick sentence or in private thought  Alike to Council or th' Assembly came  With equal souls and sentiments the same  But when by wisdom won proud  Ilion  burn'd  And in their ships the conqu'ring  Greeks  return'd  'Twas God's high will the victors to divide  And turn th'event confounding human pride  Some he destroy'd some scatter'd as the dust  Not all were prudent and not all were just  Then  Discord  sent by  Pallas  from above  Stern daughter of the great Avenger  Jove    The BrotherKings inspir'd with fell debate  Who call'd to council all th'  Achaian  state  But call'd untimely not the sacred rite  Observ'd nor heedful of the setting light  Nor herald sworn the session to proclaim  Sour with debauch a reeling tribe they came  To these the cause of meeting they explain  And  Menelaus  moves to cross the main  Not so the King of Men he will'd to stay  The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay  And calm  Minerva  's wrath Oh blind to fate  The Gods not lightly change their love or hate  With irefull taunts each other they oppose  'Till in loud tumult all the  Greeks  arose  Now diff'rent counsels ev'ry breast divide  Each burns with rancour to the adverse side  Th' unquiet night strange projects entertain'd  So  Jove  that urg'd us to our fate ordain'd  We with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd  And brought our captives and our stores aboard  But half the people with respect obey'd  The King of Men and at his bidding stay'd  Now on the wings of winds our course we keep  For God had smooth'd the waters of the deep  For  Tenedos  we spread our eager oars  There land and pay due victims to the pow'rs  To bless our safe return we join in pray'r  But angry  Jove  dispers'd our vows in air  And rais'd new discord Then so Heav'n decreed  Ulysses  first and  Nestor  disagreed  Wise as he was by various Counsels sway'd  He there tho' late to please the Monarch stay'd  But I determin'd stem the foamy floods  Warn'd of the coming fury of the Gods  With us  Tydides  fear'd and urg'd his haste  And  Menelaus  came but came the last  He join'd our vessels in the  Lesbian  bay  While yet we doubted of our watry way  If to the right to urge the pilot's toil  The safer road beside the  Psyrian  isle  Or the strait course to rocky  Chios  plow  And anchor under  Mimas  ' shaggy brow  We sought direction of the pow'r divine  The God propitious gave the guiding sign  Thro' the mid seas he bids our navy steer  And in  Eubea  shun the woes we fear  The whistling winds already wak'd the sky  Before the whistling winds the vessels fly  With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way  And reach  Gerestus  at the point of day  There hecatombs of bulls to  Neptune  slain  Highflaming please the monarch of the main  The fourth day shone when all their labours o'er  Tydides  ' vessels touch'd the wish'dfor shore  But I to  Pylos  scud before the gales  The God still breathing on my swelling sails  Sep'rate from all I safely landed here  Their fates or fortunes never reach'd my ear  Yet what I learn'd attend as here I sate  And ask'd each voyager each Hero's fate  Curious to know and willing to relate  Safe reach'd the  Mirmydons  their native land  Beneath  Achilles  ' warlike son's command  Those whom the heir of great  Apollo  's art  Brave  Philoctetes  taught to wing the dart  And those whom  Idomen  from  Ilion  's plain  Had led securely crost the dreadful main  How  Agamemnon  touch'd his  Argive  coast  And how his life by fraud and force he lost  And how the Murd'rer pay'd his forfeit breath  What lands so distant from that scene of death  But trembling heard the Fame and heard admire  How well the son appeas'd his slaughter'd sire  Ev'n to th'unhappy that unjustly bleed  Heav'n gives Posterity t'avenge the deed  So fell  Aegysthus  and may'st thou my friend  On whom the virtues of thy sire descend  Make future times thy equal act adore  And be what brave  Orestes  was before  The prudent youth reply'd Oh thou the grace  And lasting glory of the  Grecian  race  Just was the vengeance and to latest days  Shall long posterity resound the praise  Some God this arm with equal prowess bless  And the proud Suitors shall its force confess  Injurious men who while my soul is sore  Of fresh affronts are meditating more  But heav'n denies this honour to my hand  Nor shall my father repossess the land  The father's fortune never to return  And the sad son's to suffer and to mourn  Thus he and  Nestor  took the word My son  Is it then true as distant rumours run  That crowds of rivals for thy mother's charms  Thy Palace fill with insults and alarms  Say is the fault thro' tame submission thine  Or leagu'd against thee do thy people join  Mov'd by some Oracle or voice divine  And yet who knows but ripening lies in fate  An hour of vengeance for th' afflicted state  When great  Ulysses  shall suppress these harms  Ulysses  singly or all  Greece  in arms  But if  Athena  War's triumphant maid  The happy son will as the father aid  Whose fame and safety was her constant care  In ev'ry danger and in ev'ry war  Never on man did heav'nly favour shine  With rays so strong distinguish'd and divine  As those with which  Minerva  mark'd thy sire  So might she love thee so thy soul inspire  Soon shou'd their hopes in humble dust be laid  And long oblivion of the bridal bed  Ah no such hope the Prince with sighs replies  Can touch my breast that blessing heav'n denies  Ev'n by celestial favour were it giv'n  Fortune or fate wou'd cross the will of heav'n  What words are these and what imprudence thine  Thus interpos'd the Martial maid divine  Forgetful youth but know the Pow'r above  With ease can save each object of his love  Wide as his will extends his boundless grace  Nor lost in time nor circumscrib'd by place  Happier his lot who many sorrows past  Longlab'ring gains his natal shore at last  Than who too speedy hastes to end his life  By some stern ruffian or adultrous wife  Death only is the lot which none can miss  And all is possible to heav'n but this  The best the dearest fav'rite of the sky  Must taste that cup for man is born to die  Thus check'd reply'd  Ulysses  ' prudent heir  Mentor  no morethe mournful thought forbear  For he no more must draw his country's breath  Already snatch'd by Fate and the black doom of death  Pass we to other subjects and engage  On themes remote the venerable Sage  Who thrice has seen the perishable kind  Of men decay and thro' three Ages shin'd  Like Gods majestic and like Gods in mind  For much he knows and just conclusions draws  From various precedents and various laws  O son of  Neleus  awful  Nestor  tell  How he the mighty  Agamemnon  fell  By what strange fraud  Aegysthus  wrought relate  By force he could not such a Heroe's fate  Liv'd  Menelaus  not in  Greece  or where  Was then the martial brother's pious care  Condemn'd perhaps some foreign shore to tread  Or sure  Aegysthus  had not dar'd the deed  To whom the Full of Days Illustrious youth  Attend tho' partly thou hast guest the truth  For had the martial  Menelaus  found  The ruffian breathing yet on  Argive  ground  Nor earth had hid his carcase from the skies  Nor  Grecian  virgins shriek'd his obsequies  But fowls obscene dismember'd his remains  And dogs had torn him on the naked plains  While us the works of bloody  Mars  employ'd  The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy'd  He stretch'd at ease in  Argos  ' calm recess  Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless  With flattery's insinuating art  Sooth'd the frail Queen and poyson'd all her heart  At first with worthy shame and decent pride  The royal dame his lawless suit deny'd  For Virtue's image yet possest her mind  Taught by a Master of the tuneful kind  Atrides  parting for the  Trojan  war  Consign'd the youthful Consort to his care  True to his charge the Bard preserv'd her long  In honour's limits such the pow'r of Song  But when the Gods these objects of their hate  Dragg'd to destruction by the links of fate  The bard they banish'd from his native soil  And left all helpless in a desart Isle  There he the sweetest of the sacred train  Sung dying to the rocks but sung in vain  Then Virtue was no more her guard away  She fell to lust a voluntary prey  Ev'n to the temple stalk'd th' adult'rous spouse  With impious thanks and mockery of vows  With images with garments and with gold  And od'rous fumes from loaded altars roll'd  Mean time from flaming  Troy  we cut the way  With  Menelaus  thro' the curling sea  But when to  Sunium  's sacred point we came  Crown'd with the temple of th'  Athenian  dame  Atrides  ' pilot  Phrontes  there expir'd    Phrontes  of all the sons of men admir'd  To steer the bounding bark with steddy toil  When the storm thickens and the billows boil  While yet he exercis'd the steerman's art  Apollo  touch'd him with his gentle dart  Ev'n with the rudder in his hand he fell  To pay whose honours to the Shades of hell  We check'd our haste by pious office bound  And laid our old companion in the ground  And now the rites discharg'd our course we keep  Far on the gloomy bosom of the deep  Soon as  Malaea  's misty tops arise  Sudden the Thund'rer blackens all the skies  And the winds whistle and the surges roll  Mountains on mountains and obscure the pole  The tempest scatters and divides our fleet  Part the storm urges on the coast of  Creet    Where winding round the rich  Cydonian  plain  The streams of  Jardan  issue to the main  There stands a rock high eminent and steep  Whose shaggy brow o'erhangs the shady deep  And views  Gortyna  on the western side  On this rough  Auster  drove th'impetuous tyde  With broken force the billows rowl'd away  And heav'd the fleet into the neighb'ring bay  Thus sav'd from death they gain'd the  Phaestan  shores  With shatter'd vessels and disabled oars  But five tall barks the winds and waters tost  Far from their fellows on th'  Aegyptian  coast  There wander'd  Menelaus  thro' foreign shores  Amassing gold and gath'ring naval stores  While curst  Aegysthus  the detested deed  By fraud fulfill'd and his great brother bled  Sev'n years the traytor rich  Mycenae  sway'd  And his stern rule the groaning land obey'd  The eighth from  Athens  to his realm restor'd  Orestes  brandish'd the revenging sword  Slew the dire pair and gave to fun'ral flame  The vile assassin and adult'rous dame  That day ere yet the bloody triumphs cease  Return'd  Atrides  to the coast of  Greece    And safe to  Argos  ' port his navy brought  With gifts of price and pond'rous treasure fraught  Hence warn'd my son beware nor idly stand  Too long a stranger to thy native land  Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away  While lawless feasters in thy palace sway  Perhaps may seize thy realm and share the spoil  And thou return with disappointed toil  From thy vain journey to a rifled Isle  Howe'er my friend indulge one labour more  And seek  Atrides  on the  Spartan  shore  He wand'ring long a wider circle made  And manylanguag'd nations has survey'd  And measur'd tracts unknown to other ships  Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps  A length of Ocean and unbounded sky  Which scarce the seafowl in a year o'erfly  Go then to  Sparta  take the watry way  Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay  Or if by land thou chuse thy course to bend  My steeds my chariots and my sons attend  Thee to  Atrides  they shall safe convey  Guides of thy road companions of thy way  Urge him with truth to frame his free replies  And sure he will for  Menelas  is wise  Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends  And twylight gray her evening shade extends  Then thus the blueey'd Maid O full of days  Wise are thy words and just are all thy ways  Now immolate the Tongues and mix the wine  Sacred to  Neptune  and the pow'rs divine  The lamp of day is quench'd beneath the deep  And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep  Nor fits it to prolong the heav'nly feast  Timeless indecent but retire to rest  So spake  Jove  's daughter the celestial maid  The sober train attended and obey'd  The sacred heralds on their hands around  Pour'd the full urns the youths the goblets crown'd  From bowl to bowl the holy bev'rage flows  While to the final sacrifice they rose  The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame  And pour above the consecrated stream  And now their thirst by copious draughts allay'd  The youthful Hero and th'  Athenian  maid  Propose departure from the finish'd rite  And in their hollow bark to pass the night  But this the hospitable Sage denied  Forbid it  Jove  and all the Gods he cried  Thus from my walls the muchlov'd son to send  Of such a heroe and of such a friend  Me as some needy peasant would ye leave  Whom heav'n denies the blessing to relieve  Me would ye leave who boast imperial sway  When beds of royal state invite your stay  Nolong as life this mortal shall inspire  Or as my children imitate their sire  Here shall the wand'ring stranger find his home  And hospitable rites adorn the dome  Well hast thou spoke the blueey'd maid replies  Belov'd old man benevolent as wise  Be the kind dictates of thy heart obey'd  And let thy words  Telemachus  persuade  He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue  I to the ship to give the orders due  Prescribe directions and confirm the crew  For I alone sustain their naval cares  Who boast experience from these silver hairs  All Youths the rest whom to this journey move  Like years like tempers and their Prince's love  There in the vessel shall I pass the night  And soon as morning paints the fields of light  I go to challenge from the  Caucons  bold  A debt contracted in the days of old  But this thy guest receiv'd with friendly care  Let thy strong coursers swift to  Sparta  bear  Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day  And be thy son companion of his way  Then turning with the word  Minerva  flies  And soars an Eagle thro' the liquid skies  Vision divine The throng'd spectators gaze  In holy wonder fixt and still amaze  But chief the rev'rend Sage admir'd he took  The hand of young  Telemachus  and spoke  Oh happy Youth and favour'd of the skies  Distinguish'd care of guardian deities  Whose early years for future worth engage  No vulgar manhood no ignoble age  For lo none other of the court above  Than she the daughter of almighty  Jove    Pallas  herself the Wartriumphant Maid  Confest is thine as once thy father's aid  So guide me Goddess so propitious shine  On me my consort and my royal line  A yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke  Untam'd unconscious of the galling yoke  With ample forehead and yet tender horns  Whose budding honours ductile gold adorns  Submissive thus the hoary Sire preferr'd  His holy vow the fav'ring Goddess heard  Then slowly rising o'er the sandy space  Precedes the father follow'd by his race  A long procession timely marching home  In comely order to the regal dome  There when arriv'd on thrones around him plac'd  His sons and grandsons the wide circle grac'd  To these the hospitable Sage in sign  Of social welcome mix'd the racy wine  Late from the mellowing cask restor'd to light  By ten long years refin'd and rosybright  To  Pallas  high the foaming bowl he crown'd  And sprinkled large Libation on the ground  Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares  And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs  Deep in a rich Alcove the Prince was laid  And slept beneath the pompous Colonnade  Fast by his side  Pisistratus  lay spread  In age his equal on a splendid bed  But in an inner court securely clos'd  The rev'rend  Nestor  with his Queen repos'd  When now  Aurora  daughter of the dawn  With rosie lustre purpled o'er the lawn  The old man early rose walk'd forth and sate  On polish'd stone before his Palace gate  With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone  Where antient  Neleus  sate a rustic throne  But he descending to th' infernal shade  Sage  Nestor  fill'd it and the sceptre sway'd  His sons around him mild obeysance pay  And duteous take the orders of the day  First  Echephron  and  Stratius  quit their bed  Then  Perseus    Aretus  and  Thrasymed    The last  Pisistratus  arose from rest  They came and near him plac'd the strangerguest  To these the Senior thus declar'd his will  My sons the dictates of your sire fulfil  To  Pallas  first of Gods prepare the feast  Who grac'd our rites a more than mortal guest  Let one dispatchful bid some swain to lead  A wellfed bullock from the grassy mead  One seek the harbour where the vessels moor  And bring thy friends  Telemachus  ashore  Leave only two the gally to attend  Another to  Laerceus  must we send  Artist divine whose skilful hands infold  The victim's horn with circumfusile gold  The rest may here the pious duty share  And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare  The seats to range the fragrant wood to bring  And limpid waters from the living spring  He said and busy each his care bestow'd  Already at the gates the bullock low'd  Already came the  Ithacensian  crew  The dextrous smith the tools already drew  His pond'rous hammer and his anvil sound  And the strong tongs to turn the metal round  Nor was  Minerva  absent from the rite  She view'd her honours and enjoy'd the sight  With rev'rent hand the King presents the gold  Which round th'intorted horns the gilder roll'd  So wrought as  Pallas  might with pride behold  Young  Aretus  from forth his bridal bow'r  Brought the full laver o'er their hands to pour  And canisters of consecrated flour  Stratius  and  Echephron  the victim led  The axe was held by warlike  Thrasymed    In act to strike Before him  Perseus  stood  The vase extending to receive the blood  The King himself initiates to the Pow'r  Scatters with quiv'ring hand the sacred flour  And the stream sprinkles From the curling brows  The hair collected in the fire he throws  Soon as due vows on ev'ry part were pay'd  And sacred wheat upon the victim lay'd  Strong  Thrasymed  discharg'd the speeding blow  Full on his neck and cut the nerves in two  Down sunk the heavy beast the females round  Maids wives and matrons mix a shrilling sound  Nor scorn'd the Queen the holy Choir to join  The firstborn she of old  Clymenus  ' line  In youth by  Nestor  lov'd of spotless fame  And lov'd in age  Eurydicé  her name  From earth they rear him struggling now with death  And  Nestor  's Youngest stops the vents of breath  The soul for ever flies on all sides round  Streams the black blood and smokes upon the ground  The beast they then divide and disunite  The ribs and limbs observant of the rite  On these in double cawls involv'd with art  The choicest morsels lay from ev'ry part  The sacred Sage before his altar stands  Turns the burntoff'ring with his holy hands  And pours the wine and bids the flames aspire  The youth with instruments surround the fire  The thighs now sacrific'd and entrails drest  Th'assistants part transfix and broil the rest  While these officious tend the rites divine  The last fair branch of the  Nestorean  line  Sweet  Polycaste  took the pleasing toil  To bathe the Prince and pour the fragrant oil  O'er his fair limbs a flow'ry vest he threw  And issu'd like a God to mortal view  His former feat beside the King he found  His people's Father with his Peers around  All plac'd at ease the holy banquet join  And in the dazling goblet laughs the wine  The rage of thirst and hunger now supprest  The Monarch turns him to his royal guest  And for the promis'd journey bids prepare  The smoothhair'd horses and the rapid car  Observant of his word The word scarce spoke  The sons obey and join them to the yoke  Then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings  And presents such as suit the state of Kings  The glitt'ring seat  Telemachus  ascends  His faithful guide  Pisistratus  attends  With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew  He lash'd the coursers and the coursers flew  Beneath the bounding yoke alike they held  Their equal pace and smoak'd along the held  The tow'rs of  Pylos  sink its views decay  Fields after fields fly back till close of day  Then sunk the Sun and darken'd all the way  To  Pherae  now  Diocleus  ' stately seat  Of  Alpheus  ' race the weary youths retreat  His house affords the hospitable rite  And pleas'd they sleep the blessing of the night  But when  Aurora  daughter of the dawn  With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn  Again they mount their journey to renew  And from the sounding portico they flew  Along the waving fields their way they hold  The fields receding as the chariot roll'd  Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light  And o'er the shaded landscape rush'd the night  WK  PFsc  OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD BOOK  OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD BOOK  I  _THE Scene is now remov'd from  Ithaca  to  Pylos  and with it a new vein of Poetry is opened Instead of the riots of the Suitors we are entertain'd with the wisdom and piety of  Nestor  This and the following book are a kind of Supplement to the  Iliad  the nature of Epic poetry requires that something should be left to the imagination of the Reader nor is the picture to be entirely drawn at full length  Homer  therefore to satisfie our curiosity gives an account of the fortunes of those great men who made so noble a figure at the siege of  Troy  This conduct also shews his art Variety gives life and delight and it is much more necessary in Epic than in Comic or Tragic Poetry sometimes to shift the Scenes to diversify and embellish the story But as on the stage the Poet ought not to step at once from one part of the world to a too remote country for this destroys credibility and the auditor cannot fancy himself this minute here and the next a thousand miles distant so in Epic Poetry every removal  must be within the degrees of probability We have here a very easy transition the Poet carries his Heroe no further than he really might sail in the compass of time he allots for his voyage If he had still dwelt upon the disorders of the Suitors without interruption he must grow tiresome but he artfully breaks the thread of their History with beautiful incidents and Episodes and reserves the further recital of their disorders for the end of his Poem By this method we sit down with fresh appetite to the entertainment and rise at last not cloy'd but satisfied  II  VERSE  Thro' Heav'ns eternal brazen portals    The original calls Heaven  or  brazen  the reason of it arises either from the Palaces of the Gods being built of brass by  Vulcan  or rather the word implies no more than the Stability of Heaven which for the same reason is in other places call'd  or  fram'd of iron  Eustathius  III  VERSE  At nine green Theatres    It may be ask'd why the Poet is so very particular as to mention that the  Pylians  were divided into nine assemblies and may it not seem a circumstance of no importance  Eustathius  answers from the Antients that there were nine cities subject to the power of  Nestor  five in  Pylos  the rest in  Boeotia  the Poet therefore allots one Bank or Theatre to every city which consisted of men the whole number amounting to These cities furnish'd the like complement of men to  Nestor  for the war at  Troy  He sail'd in ninety vessels and allowing fifty men to each vessel they amount to that number Hence it appears that this was a national sacrifice every city furnish'd nine bulls and by consequence the whole nation were partakers of it  IV  VERSE Ibid  The sacrifice of the  Pylians  This was a very solemn sacrifice of the  Pylians  How comes it then to pass that  Homer  passes it over in one line  Eustathius  answers that the occasion disallows a longer description and  Homer  knows when to speak and when to be silent He chuses to carry on the adventures of  Telemachus  rather than amuse himself in descriptions that contribute nothing to the story he finds a time of more leisure in the latter part of this book and there he describes it at length  They taste the entrails  that is every person eat a small portion of the sacrifice and by this method every person became partaker of it  There is nothing in  Homer  that shews where this sacrifice was offer'd whether in a Temple or in the open air But  Eustathius  tells us from  Strabo  that it was in the Temple of  Samian Neptune      V  VERSE  Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies  And sure he will For Wisdom never lies    This sentiment is truly noble and as nobly expressed the simplicity of the diction corresponds with that of the thought  Homer  in many places testifies the utmost abhorrence of a Lye This verse is twice repeated in the present book as well as in some others and nothing can be stronger in the same view than that of  Achilles  in the th  Iliad    Who dares think one thing and another tell  My heart detests him as the gates of hell  VI  VERSE  Born with good omens and with heav'n thy friend    There is some obscurity in the  Greek  expression and the antient  Critics have made it more obscure by their false interpretations they imagine that the Poet only meant to say that  Telemachus  was the legitimate son of  Penelope  and  Ulysses  Eustathius  Dacier  very justly condemns this explication as unworthy of  Homer  and gives us a more plain and natural interpretation  viz  "You were not born in despight of the Gods that is you are well made and of a good presence you have good inclinations and in a word your birth is happy"  She explains  after the same manner  "You were not educated in despight of the Gods"  that is  "the Gods have blessed your education"  This explication seems to be just and answers perfectly the design of  Minerva  which was to give a decent assurance to  Telemachus  You are a person says the Goddess of a good presence and happy education why then should you be ashamed to appear before  Nestor  VII  VERSE  And spread soft Hydes upon the yellow sands    It is with pleasure that I read such passages in an Author of so great antiquity as are pictures of the simplicity of those heroic ages It is the remark of  Eustathius  that  Pisistratus  the son of a King does not seat these strangers upon purple Tapestry or any other costly furniture but upon the Skins of beasts that had nothing to recommend them but their softness being spread upon the sand of the seashores  This whole passage pleases me extremely there is a spirit of true Devotion Morality and good Sense in it and the decency of behaviour between  Nestor  and  Telemachus  is describ'd very happily  Nestor  shews great benevolence to  Telemachus    Telemachus  great reverence to  Nestor  the modesty of the one and the humanity of the other are worthy of our observation We see the same picture of  Nestor  in the  Odyssey  that was drawn of him in the  Iliads  with this only difference that there he was a Counsellor of War here he is painted in softer colours ruling his people in peace and diffusing a spirit of piety thro' his whole territories  He had now surviv'd the war of  Troy  almost ten years and the Gods reward the old age of this wise and religious Prince with peace and happiness  VIII  VERSE  Last deign  Telemachus  and me to bless    Since  Minerva  here mentions the name of  Telemachus  in her prayer how comes it to pass that  Nestor  is at a loss to know  Telemachus Minerva  sate close by  Nestor  he must therefore be suppos'd to hear the prayer and yet in the following lines he enquires who these strangers are We can scarce imagine  Nestor  ignorant that the son of  Ulysses  was named  Telemachus  there being so strict a friendship between  Nestor  and  Ulysses  Perhaps therefore  Minerva  pray'd in secret mentally or perhaps  Nestor  might not take notice of what was not addrest immediately to him and consequently make enquiry about it for the greater certainty  IX  VERSE  Relate if business or the thirst of gain  c  If we form our images of persons and actions in antient times from the images of persons and actions in modern ages we shall fall into great mistakes Thus in the present passage if we annex the same idea of Piracy as it was practis'd three thousand years past to Piracy as it is practis'd in our ages what can be a greater affront than this enquiry of  Nestor  But says  Eustathius  Piracy was formerly not only accounted lawful but honourable I doubt not but  Thucydides  had this passage in view when he says that the antient Poets introduce men enquiring of those who frequent the sea if they be pirates as a thing no way ignominious  Thucydides  tells us in the same place that all those who liv'd on the seacoast or in the Islands maintain'd themselves by frequent inrodes upon unfortify'd towns and if such piracies were nobly perform'd they were accounted glorious  Herodotus  also writes that many of the antients especially about  Thrace  thought it ignominious to live by labouring the ground but to live by piracy and plunder was esteem'd a life of honour  Eustathius  XI  VERSE  The speech of  Nestor  Eustathius  observes the modesty of  Nestor Telemachus  had ascrib'd the fall of  Troy  in a great measure to  Nestor  but  Nestor  speaks not in particular of himself but is content with his share of glory in common with other warriors he speaks in the plural number and joyns all the  Greeks  as in the war so in the glory of it  Nestor  speaks of the sufferings of the  Greeks  by sea as well as by land during the siege of  Troy  To understand this it is necessary to remember that the  Greeks  made many expeditions against other places during the war both by sea and land as appears from many passages in the  Iliads  particularly from what  Achilles  says in the ninth book  XI  VERSE  There  Ajax  great  Achilles  there the brave    I have observ'd that the Poet inserts into the  Odyssey  several incidents that happen'd after the fall of  Troy  and by that method agreeably diversifies his Poetry and satisfies the curiosity of the Reader  Eustathius  remarks here that he gives a title of honour to all the Heroes he mentions but only to  Achilles Achilles  had been the occasion of the sufferings and death of many of the  Greeks  by his anger and obstinacy in refusing to obey  Agamemnon  therefore while  Nestor  is lamenting the calamities of the  Greeks  he passes over  Achilles  without any honourable mention who had so greatly added to their sufferings But I think this remark chimerical one may as well say  Achilles  needed no Epithet to distinguish him  It is with pleasure I see the old man dwell upon the praise of  Antilochus  The father enlarges upon the fame of the son he gives him four epithets of glory and while  Ajax  is only praised  as a warrior  Antilochus  is great and good excellent in the standing fight or swift to pursue an enemy  Longinus  has observ'd upon the beauty of this passage  XII  VERSE  Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shin'd    Nestor  speaks of  Ulysses  as an inseparable friend and it shews an excellent disposition in them both to be rivals and yet without envy But the art of  Nestor  is remarkable he first gives the character to  Ulysses  of being superior in wisdom to all the  Greeks  and yet at last he finds a way secretly to set himself on a level with him if not above him We ever says he thought the same thoughts and were ever of the same sentiments which tho' it may imply that they were of equal wisdom yet there is room left for it to signify that  Ulysses  always assented to the wisdom of  Nestor  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  The Council or the Assembly    There is a remarkable difference between  and  The former denotes a select number of men assembled in council the latter a public assembly where all the people were present  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Sent by  Pallas  Nestor  in modesty conceals the reason of the anger of the Goddess out of respect to  Ajax  the  Locrian  who was then dead The crime of  Ajax  was the violation of  Cassandra  even in the Temple of  Minerva  before her image But why should the Goddess be angry at others for the crime of  Ajax  this is because they omitted to punish the offender If  Ajax  was criminal in offending others are criminal for not punishing the offence  Eustathius  The crime of  Ajax  is mention'd in  Virgil Aen    Pallasnè exurere classem  Argivûm atque ipsos potuit submergere ponto  Unius ob noxam furias Ajacis Oilei  c  Could angry  Pallas  with revengeful spleen  The  Graecian  navy burn and drown the men  She for the fault of one offending foe  The bolts of  Jove  himself presum'd to throw  Dryden  Virgil  borrow'd the description of the punishment of  Ajax  from the th of the  Odyssey  XV  VERSE c  Who call'd to council  But call'd untimely  c  It may seem at first view that the Poet affirms the night to be an improper season to convene a Council This is not his meaning In the  Iliad  there are several councils by night nay  is used proverbially to express the bestconcerted councils What therefore  Nestor  here condemns is the calling not a select but public assembly of the soldiers in the night when they are in no danger of an enemy and when they are apt to fly into insolence thro' wine and the joy of victory The night is then undoubtedly an ill chosen season because the licence of the soldier cannot be so well restrain'd by night as by day  Eustathius  XVI  VERSE  Oh blind to fate    It may be ask'd why  Nestor  condemns so solemnly this Heroe calling him  when he describes him in so pious an action this is not because the Gods are implacable for as  Homer  himself writes  but because he vainly imagin'd that they would so soon  be appeas'd without any justice done upon the offender  are the words of  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  Wise as he was by various Counsels sway'd  He there tho' late to please the Monarch stay'd    It is with great address that  Nestor  relates the return of  Ulysses  to  Agamemnon  he ascribes it not directly to  Ulysses  but to his associates in the voyage he mollifies it in complaisance to  Telemachus  But  Nestor  according to  Dacier  conceals the true reason of his return it was not to please  Agamemnon  but out of fear of the Goddess  Minerva  whose statue he had taken by force from  Troy  to appease that Goddess he returns to joyn in sacrifice with  Agamemnon  Eustathius  XVIII  VERSE  Warn'd of the coming fury of the Gods    It may be ask'd how  Nestor  attain'd this knowledge of the evils which the Gods were preparing  Eustathius  ascribes it to his great Wisdom which gave him an insight into futurity  Dacier  with more reason tells us that  Nestor  knew that  Minerva  had been offended and might consequently apprehend a punishment was to be inflicted for the offence  XIX  VERSE  But I to  Pylos c  Eustathius  observes from the Antients that the Poet with great judgment suspends and breaks off this relation of  Nestor  by this method he has an opportunity to carry  Telemachus  to other countries and insert into his Poem the story of  Menelaus  and  Helen  This method likewise gives an air of probability to what he writes the Poet seems afraid to deceive and when he sends  Telemachus  to other parts for better intelligence he seems to consult truth and exactness  XX  VERSE  Achilles'  warlike son    The son of  Achilles  was nam'd  Neoptolemus  by others  Pyrrhus  his story is this When he had reach'd  Thessaly  with the  Myrmidons  of  Achilles  by the advice of  Thetis  he set fire to his vessels And being warn'd by  Helenus  from the Oracles to fix his habitation where he found a house whose foundations were iron whose walls were wood and whose roof was wool he took his journey on foot and coming to a certain lake of  Epirus  he found some persons fixing their spears with the points downwards into the earth and covering the tops of them with their cloaks and after this manner making their tents he look'd upon the Oracle as fulfill'd and dwelt there Afterwards having a son by  Andromache  the wife of  Hector  he nam'd him  Molossus  from whom the region took the name of  Molossia  From this country are the  Molossi canes  mention'd by  Virgil  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  So fell  Aegysthus  and may'st thou my friend  c  Nestor  introduces the mention of  Aegysthus  very artfully it is to raise an emulation in  Telemachus  to revenge  Ulysses  as  Orestes  had  Agamemnon  it has the intended effect and we find that  Telemachus  dwells upon his story with a virtuous envy yet at the same time with great modesty  Eustathius  gives us a different reading in    or    both the expressions are used in  Homer  the preference is therefore submitted to the Reader  XXII  VERSE  Mov'd by some Oracle or voice divine    The words in the original are  following the voice of some God  that is some Oracle  Homer  does not confine the expression either to a good or bad sense but the context plainly shews that they must be understood in a bad sense namely to imply that the people had recourse to pretended Oracles to justify their rebellion This is evident from what follows where  Nestor  encourages  Telemachus  to expect that  Ulysses  may punish them for their crimes  if there had been no crime there ought to be no punishment  XXIII  VERSE  Ulysses  singly or all  Greece  in arms    The Poet shews his great judgment in preparing the Reader for the destruction of the Suitors that great Catastrophe is manag'd by few hands and it might seem incredible that so few could destroy so many the Poet therefore to give an air of truth to his action frequently inculcates the assistance of  Pallas  which must at least shew that such a great exploit is not impossible to be executed by stratagems and valour It is by art not strength that  Ulysses  conquers  All  Greece  in arms  This is spoken in a general sense and comprehends not only the subjects of  Ulysses  or even the  Pylians  and  Spartans  but implies that all the  Greeks  would rise in the cause of  Ulysses  What the Suitors had spoken scoffingly in the preceding book  viz  that  Telemachus  was sailing to  Pyle  or  Sparta  for  supplies  appears in this not to be impracticable so that it was choice and not necessity that determin'd the Poet to make use of no such easy expedients for the destruction of the Suitors  Eustathius  It may be added that the very nature of Epic Poetry and of the  Odyssey  in particular requires such a conduct In the  Iliad Achilles  is the chief agent and performs almost all the great actions  Aeneas  is painted after the same manner by  Virgil  the one kills  Hector  the other  Turnus  both which are the decisive actions It was equally necessary to exalt the character of  Ulysses  by bringing him into difficulties from which he is personally to extricate himself This the Poet sufficiently brings about by refusing all the easy methods for his reestablishment because the more difficult ways are most conducive to the honour of his Heroe Thus as  Achilles  and  Aeneas  kill  Hector  and  Turnus  with their own hands so the Suitors fall chiefly by the hand of  Ulysses  It is necessary for the Heroe of the Poem to execute the decisive action for by this method the Poet compleats his character his own greatness surmounts all difficulties and he goes off the stage with the utmost advantage by leaving a noble character upon the mind of the spectators  XXIV  VERSE  Fortune or fate wou'd cross the will of Heav'n    It may be ask'd how an expression so near blasphemy as  Eustathius  observes could escape a person of such piety as  Telemachus  'Tis true the Poet makes  Minerva  herself correct it but yet the objection remains  viz  how could  Telemachus  speak it I think since the Poet himself condemns it we may give it up as an indecency in  Telemachus  it is natural for men in despair and that was the condition of  Telemachus  to use a vehemence of expression and this might transport  Telemachus  beyond the bounds of prudence The only possible way that occurs to me to take off the impiety is to have recourse to Destiny It was the opinion of the Antients that the Gods could not alter Destiny and then  Telemachus  may mean no more than that it was decreed by the Destinies that  Ulysses  shall return no more so the Gods themselves could not restore him  Thus in the th of the  Metamorphosis    Venus  in vain applies to the Gods to preserve  Julius Caesar  Superosque movet qui rumpere quanquam  Ferrea non possunt veterum decreta sororum  c  And a little lower  Jupiter  says to  Venus    Sola insuperabile fatum  Nata movere paras  XXV  VERSE  Happier his lot who  c  Nothing can be better imagin'd to encourage  Telemachus  than what the Poet here delivers She sets  Agamemnon  in opposition to  Ulysses Agamemnon  made a speedy voyage to his country and there fell by treachery  Ulysses  has long been absent but yet is happier than  Agamemnon  the Gods perhaps reserve him for better fortunes at least nothing can be concluded from his long absence and this is sufficient to teach  Telemachus  not to despair  Eustathius  XXVI  VERSE  And all is possible to heav'n but this    What  Minerva  here says justifies the remark I made that what  Telemachus  seem'd to have spoken rashly may be soften'd if not vindicated by having recourse to Destiny It is evident from this passage that Destiny was superior to the power of the Gods otherwise  Minerva  speaks as blasphemously as  Telemachus  For what difference is there between saying that the Gods cannot preserve even these they love from death and saying that the Gods could not save  Ulysses  Why therefore may not the words of  Telemachus  be thought to have respect to Destiny  I am of opinion that the Poet had something further in view by putting these words into the mouth of  Minerva  The words  of  Telemachus  if taken grosly might appear shocking to so pious a person as  Nestor  and make an ill impression upon him to the disadvantage of  Telemachus    Minerva  therefore artfully explains it and softens the horrour of it by reconciling it to the Theology of those ages  XXVII  VERSE  Pass we to other subjects    Telemachus  here puts several questions as it were in a breath to  Nestor  and  Plutarch  observes upon this passage that he who enquires any thing of an old man tho' the old man himself has no concern in the story wins his heart at once and incites a person who is upon all occasions very willing to discourse He introduces this as an instance of the art  Telemachus  uses in adapting himself by his questions to the temper of the person with whom he converses He puts together continues he several questions upon several subjects which is more judicious than to confine his answer to a single interrogatory and by that method deprive  Nestor  of one of the most pleasant enjoyments of old age I mean the pleasure of talking  Plutarch Symposiac  XXVIII  VERSE  Who thrice has seen the perishable kind  Of men decay    The Poet here tells us that  Nestor  was now in his fourth generation  Ovid  took the word  to signify an hundred years but then  Nestor  must have been above years old Others with more probability understand it to signify a generation or such a portion of time in which any race of men flourish together which is computed to be about thirty years I refer the Reader to the Note upon the d verse in the first book of the  Iliad  for the particular age of  Nestor  According to that computation he must now be about ninety five years of age  XXIX  VERSE  How he the mighty  Agamemnon  fell    Telemachus  does not ask this question out of curiosity but with great judgment he knows there were designs against his life as well as there had been against  Agamemnon  he therefore asks it that he may learn how to defeat them chiefly to instruct himself how best to assist his father upon his return by aiding him in escaping the snares of the Suitors  Dacier  XXX  VERSE  Taught by a Master of the tuneful kind    Homer  thro' the whole  Odyssey  speaks much in honour of the Art which he himself loved and in which he so eminently excell'd From these and other passages we may learn the state of Poetry in those ages  "Poets says  Eustathius  were rank'd in the class of Philosophers and the Ancients made use of them as Praeceptors in Music and Morality"  Strabo  quotes this very passage as an instance of the excellence of Poetry in forming the soul to worthy actions  Aegysthus  could not debauch  Clytemnestra  'till he banish'd the Poet who was her guide and instructor  Various are the conjectures of the Ancients about the name of the Bard here celebrated Some says  Eustathius  tell us it was  Chariades  some  Demodocus  some  Glaucus    c  but I pass them over because they are conjectures  There were many degrees of these  some were  others  But such Bards as are here mention'd were of an higher station and retain'd as instructors by Kings and Princes  I cannot omit one remark of  Eustathius  he tells us that some persons write that these  had their names from hence  exactly resembling the modern  Italian  singers Madam  Dacier  is not to be forgiven for passing over a remark of such importance if this be true it makes a great  difference between the antient and modern Poets and is the only advantage I know we have over them  XXXI  VERSE  Then Virtue was no more her guard away  She fell  c  There is a fine moral couch'd in the story of the Bard and  Clytemnestra  it admirably paints the advantage we draw from wise companions for the improvement of our Virtues  Clytemnestra  was chaste because her instructor was wise His wisdom was an insuperable guard to her modesty It was long before she yielded virtue and honour had a long contest but she no sooner yielded to adultery but she assisted in the murder of her husband from whence we may draw another moral that one vice betrays us into another and when once the fences of honour are thrown down we become a prey to every passion  Dacier  XXXII  VERSE  Ev'n to the temple stalk'd th' adult'rous spouse    Here is a surprizing mixture of religion and impiety  Aegysthus  upon the accomplishment of so great a crime as adultery returns thanks to the Gods by oblations as if they had assisted him in the execution of it  Nestor  dwells upon it at large to shew that  Aegysthus  greatly aggravated his guilt by such a piece of impious devotion  Dacier  XXXIII  VERSE  Apollo  touch'd him with his gentle dart    Homer  calls the darts of  Apollo  or gentle to signify that those who dye thus suddenly dye without pain  Eustathius  Dacier  complains that some Critics think  Homer  worthy of blame for enlarging upon so mean a person as a pilot and giving us his genealogy It is a sufficient answer to observe that arts were in  high esteem in those times and men that were eminent in them were in great honour Neither were arts then confin'd as in these ages to mean personages no less a person than  Ulysses  builds a vessel in the sequel of the  Odyssey  so that this is a false piece of delicacy If  Homer  be culpable so is  Virgil  he gives the genealogy of  Palinurus  as well as  Homer  of  Phrontis Virgil  's description is censur'd as too long  Homer  concludes his in seven lines and lastly  Virgil  's Episode has been judg'd by the Critics to be an unnecessary ornament and to contribute nothing to the Poem  Homer  relates the death of  Phrontis  to introduce the dispersion of the fleet of  Menelaus  the fleet might well be scatter'd when it wanted so excellent a pilot  XXXIV  VERSE  Part the storm urges on the coast of  Crete  Homer  does not amuse us by relating what became of these companions of  Menelaus  he omits this judiciously and follows the thread of his story  Menelaus  is the person whom the Poet has in view he therefore passes over the story of his companions to carry on the fable of the Poem by leading us directly to  Menelaus  XXXV  VERSE  On th'  Aegyptian  coast    In the original it is  The wind and water carry'd them to  Aegyptus  Homer  by  Aegyptus  means the river  Nile  and then it is always used in the masculine gender the region about it took its name from the river  Aegyptus  this is always used in the feminine gender but the country had not receiv'd that name in the days of  Homer  Eustathius  What  Dacier  adds to this observation may assist in determining the dispute concerning the priority of  Homer  and  Hesiod Hesiod  makes mention of the river  Nilus  if therefore it be true that  Aegyptus  had not been called by the name of  Nilus  in the times  of  Homer  it is a demonstration that  Hesiod  was posterior to  Homer  otherwise he could not have been acquainted with any other name but that of  Aegyptus  XXXVI  VERSE  From  Athens  to his realm    There is a different reading in this place instead of  some write  for  Orestes  was educated by  Strophius  King of  Phocis  and father of  Pylades  The Ancients reconcile the difference by saying that  Orestes  might be sent from  Phocis  to  Athens  for his education and returning thence to his own country might revenge the death of his father  Agamemnon  so that although he was first bred up in  Phocis  he was afterwards a sojourner in  Athens  Eustathius  XXXVII  VERSE  A length of Ocean and unbounded sky  Which scarce the seafowl in a year o'erfly    It must be confest that  Nestor  greatly exaggerates this description  Homer  himself tells us that a ship may sail in five days from  Crete  to  Aegypt  wherefore then this Hyperbole of  Nestor  It might perhaps be to deter  Telemachus  from a design of sailing to  Crete  and he through his inexperience might believe the description It may be added that what  Nestor  speaks concerning the flight of birds may be only said to shew the great distance of that sea Nay by a favourable interpretation it may be reconcil'd to truth the meaning then must be this Should a person observe that sea a whole year he would not see one bird flying over it both because of the vastness and dreadfulness of it and perhaps the whole of this might arise from the observation that this sea is not frequented by birds This is wholly and almost literally taken from  Eustathius  and if we add to this the ignorance of the sea and seaaffairs in those ages we shall the less wonder to hear so wise a man as  Nestor  describing it with so much  terror Navigation is now greatly improv'd and the Moderns sail further in a month than the Ancients could in a year their whole art consisting chiefly in coasting along the shores and consequently they made but little way  XXXVIII  VERSE  Now immolate the tongues    Various are the reasons which  Eustathius  reports concerning this oblation of the tongues at the conclusion of the sacrifice It was to purge themselves from any evil words they might have utter'd or because the tongue was reckon'd the best part of the sacrifice and so reserv'd for the completion of it or they offer'd the tongue to the Gods as witnesses to what they had spoken I omit the rest as superfluous They had a custom of offering the tongues to  Mercury  because they believ'd him the giver of Eloquence  Dacier  expatiates upon this custom The people says she might fear lest thro' wine and the joy of the festival they might have utter'd some words unbecoming the sanctity of the occasion by this sacrifice of the tongues they signify'd that they purged away whatever they had spoken amiss during the festival and ask'd in particular pardon of  Mercury  who presided over discourse to the end they might not carry home any uncleanness which might stop the blessings expected from the sacrifice  XXXIX  VERSE  Nor fits it to prolong the heav'nly feast  Timeless indecent  c  Eustathius  shews the difference between  festivals and  or sacrifices in the former it was customary to spend the whole night in wine and rejoicing In the latter this was reckon'd an unlawful custom thro' the fear of falling into any indecencies through wine He likewise gives another reason of this injunction by telling us that it was the custom to offer sacrifices  to the celestial Powers in the time of the day and even to finish them about the setting of the sun and that those who dealt in incantations perform'd their sacrifices to the infernal powers by night and finish'd them before sunrising Either of these reasons sufficiently explains the words of the Goddess and the former carries in it an excellent moral that particular care should be taken in our acts of devotion not to turn religion into impiety  XL  VERSE  When beds of royal state invite your stay    This passage gives us a full insight into the manners of these hospitable ages they not only kept a treasury for bowls or vases of gold or silver to give as  or gifts of hospitality but also a wardrobe of various habits and rich furniture to lodge and bestow upon strangers  Eustathius  relates that  Tellias  of  Agrigentum  was a person of so great hospitality that five hundred horsemen coming to his house in the winter season he entertain'd them and gave every man a cloak and a tunic This laudable custom prevailed and still prevails in the eastern countries it was the practice of  Abraham  of old and is at this day of the  Turks  as we may learn from their Caravansaries erected for the reception of travellers And yet  Dacier  observes that a  French  Critic has shew'd so ill a taste as to ridicule this passage  "  Telemachus  says that Author being entertain'd by  Nestor  intimates his intention of returning to lodge on shipboard with his companions but  Nestor  detains him by asking if he thought he had not quilts or coverlets to give him a night's lodging Upon this  Telemachus  goes to bed in a resounding gallery and  Nestor  in a bed which his wife made ready for him"  The noblest things are most liable to burlesque by perverting their meaning as some pictures by varying the position represent a man or a monster He is very severe upon the resounding gallery which in truth means no more than very lofty or elevated and by consequence very noble and magnificent  XLI  VERSE  I go to challenge from the  Caucons  The Poet makes a double use of these words of the Goddess she gives an air of probability to her excuse why she should not be press'd to stay and at the same time  Homer  avoids the absurdity of introducing that Goddess at  Sparta  where  Menelaus  and  Helen  are celebrating the nuptials of their son and daughter  Minerva  is a Virgin Deity and consequently an enemy to all nuptial ceremonies  Eustathius  But it may be necessary to observe who these  Caucons  are we find in the tenth book the  Caucons  mention'd as auxiliaries to  Troy  There  Dolon  says  The  Carians    Caucons  the  Pelasgian  host  And  Leleges  encamp along the coast  Are these  Caucons  the same with those here mention'd  Eustathius  informs us that there was a people of  Triphyly  between  Elis  and  Pylos  named  Caucons  But  Strabo  says that the whole race is now extinct and that these here mention'd are of  Dymaea  and take their name from the river  Caucon  whereas those in the  Iliads  are  Paphlagonians  they were a wandring nation and consequently might be the same people originally and retain the same name in different countries  XLII  VERSE  But chief the rev'rend Sage admir'd    It may be ask'd why  Nestor  is in such a surprize at the discovery of the Goddess It is evident from the  Iliad  that he had been no stranger to such intercourses of the Deities nay in this very book  Nestor  tells us that  Ulysses  enjoy'd almost the constant presence of  Minerva  insomuch that  Sophocles  the great imitator of  Homer  relates that he knew the Goddess by her voice without seeing  her  Eustathius  answers that the wonder of  Nestor  arose not from the discovery of that Deity but that she should accompany so young a person as  Telemachus  After her departure the old man stood amaz'd and look'd upon that Heroe as some very extraordinary person whom in such early years the Goddess of War and Wisdom had vouchsafed to attend This interpretation agrees perfectly with what  Nestor  speaks to  Telemachus  XLIII  VERSE  Distinguish'd care of guardian deities    I will take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made against all interposition of the Gods in assisting the Heroes of the  Odyssey  It has been thought by some Critics a disparagement to them to stand in continual need of such supernatural succour If two persons were engaged in combat and a third person should immediately step in to the assistance of one of the parties and kill the adversary would it not reflect upon the valour of his friend who was so weak as to want such assistance Why for instance should  Jupiter  help  Aeneas  to kill  Turnus  Was not he brave enough to fight and strong enough to conquer his enemy by his own prowess and would not  Turnus  have kill'd  Aeneas  with the same assistance It is therefore a disparagement to the actors thus continually to supply the defects of a Heroe by the power of a Deity  But this is a false way of arguing and from hence it might be infer'd that the love and favour of a Deity serves only to make those whom he assists and those who depend upon such assistance appear weak impotent cowardly and unworthy to be conquerors Can any doubt arise whether the love and favour of a God be a disparagement or honour to those whom he favours According to these Critics we should find the character of a perfect Heroe in an impious  Mezentius  who acknowledges no God but his own arm and his own sword 'Tis true the objection would be just if the Heroe himself perform'd nothing of the action or if when he were almost conquer'd by the superior valour of his enemy he ow'd his life and victory to Gods  and Miracles But the Heroe always behaves himself in all his actions as if he were to gain success without the assistance of the Deity and the presence of the Gods is so order'd that we may retrench every thing that is miraculous without making any alteration in the action or character of the human personages Thus in the instance of  Aeneas  and  Turnus  tho'  Jupiter  favours  Aeneas  yet  Aeneas  is painted in stronger colours of fortitude he appears superior as a man unassisted and able to conquer  Turnus  and consequently the favour of  Jupiter  makes no alteration in the action or character of  Aeneas  There is likewise a wide difference between the assistance of a Man and of a God The actions of men belong only to the performers of those actions but when a Deity assists us by inspiring us with strength and courage the actions we perform are really our own and the more he favours us the more glory he gives us so that the assistance of man eclipses but the assistance of a God exalts our glory Thus for instance when  Achilles  is pursuing  Hector  he charges the  Greeks  to keep off from  Hector  their assistance might lessen his glory but when  Pallas  offers her assistance he immediately embraces it as an honour and boasts of it as such to  Hector  I have been large upon this objection because the Reader ought to carry it in his memory thro' the whole Poem and apply it to every action in which any share is ascribed to any Deity See  Bossu  more at large concerning this objection  XLIV  VERSE  And sate On polish'd stone before his Palace gate    We have here an ancient custom recorded by the Poet a King places himself before the gate of his Palace upon a seat of marble worn smooth by long use says  Eustathius  or perhaps smooth'd exquisitely by the hand of the workman What I would chiefly observe is that they placed themselves thus in public for the dispatch of justice We read in the scripture of Judges  sitting in the gate  and that this procedure of  Nestor  was for that purpose is probable from the expression  He sate in the seat where  Neleus    or  Consiliarius    used to sit  which seems to express his wisdom in the discharge of justice  Nestor  is also describ'd as bearing his sceptre in his hand which was never used but upon some act of regality in the dispatch of justice or other solemn occasions Perhaps says  Dacier  these seats or thrones might be consecrated with oil to draw a reverence to the seats of Justice as by an act of religion but I rather judge adds she that no more is meant than to express the shining of these thrones they being undoubtedly made of marble  XLV  VERSE  Pisistratus    Would I indulge my fancy in a conjecture I might suppose that the famous tyrant  Pisistratus  was descended or borrow'd his name from this son of  Nestor Herodotus  informs us as  Eustathius  observes that all the  Pisistrati  were originally  Pylians  If this be true we have a very strong evidence that  Homer  is not all fiction but that he celebrates the great men of those ages with reality and only embellishes the true story with the ornaments of Poetry  XLVI  VERSE  Laerceus  Artist divine  c  The Author of the  Parallel  quotes this passage to prove that  Homer  was ignorant of the Mechanic arts We have here says he a Gilder with his anvil and hammer but what occasion has he for an anvil and hammer in the art of a Gilder  Boileau  has excellently vindicated  Homer  from this objection in his reflections upon  Longinus  this Gilder was a goldbeater  Nestor  we see furnish'd the gold and he beat it into leaves so that he had occasion to make use of his anvil and hammer the anvil was portable because the work was not laborious Our modern travellers assure us that it is at this day the practice in the eastern regions as in  Persia  c for the artists in metals to carry about with them the whole implements of trade to the house of the persons where they find employment  it is therefore a full vindication of  Homer  to observe that the gold this artist used in gilding was nothing but gold beat into fine leaves  XLVII  VERSE  Nor was  Minerva  absent    It may be ask'd in what sense  Minerva  can be said to come to the sacrifice  Eustathius  answers that the Ancients finding the inclinations of men to be bent incontinently upon pleasures to oblige them to use them moderately distinguish'd times ordain'd sacrifices and representing the Gods in the forms of men brought them to use those pleasures with discretion they taught them that the Gods came down to their libations and sacrifices to induce them to govern their conversation with reverence and modesty Thus  Jupiter  and the other Gods in the  Iliads  and  Neptune  in the  Odyssey  are said to feast with the  Aethiopians  If I might be pardon'd a conjecture I would suppose that  Minerva  may in another sense be said to come to the sacrifice I mean by her Image or statue and what may seem to confirm this opinion is what  Diodorus  relates in his third book concerning the abovemention'd  Aethiopians  they carry'd about the statues of  Jupiter  and the other Gods twelve days during which time the Gods were said to be gone to the  Aethiopians  and if the Gods may be said to come to the  Aethiopians  by their statues why may not the same be said of  Minerva  from the introduction of her statue among the  Pylians  So that the appearance of the Goddess may possibly mean the appearance of her statue  XLVIII  VERSE  Stratius  and  Echephron c  Nestor  here makes use only of the ministry of his sons the reason of it is because it was reckon'd honourable to serve in the performance of sacrifice this being in some sense an attending upon the Gods or because it was the practice of those ages for  great persons to do those offices with their own hands which in the latter have been perform'd by servants  Eustathius  reports a saying of  Antigonus  who observing his son behaving himself imperiously to his subjects  "Know'st thou not says he that Royalty it self is but illustrious servitude"  an intimation that he himself was but a servant of the public and therefore should use his servants with moderation  But the true reason of  Nestor  's assisting in the sacrifice is because Kings anciently had the inspection of religion and Priesthood was joyn'd to Royalty according to that of  Virgil    Rex Anius rex idem hominum Phoebique sacerdos  XLIX  VERSE  Maids wives and matrons mix a shrilling sound    I have kept the meaning of the word in the original which signifies prayers made with loud cries  says  Hesychius  is    the voice of women    which they make at sacrifices in their prayers  But there is still something in it more to the present purpose the Scholiast upon  Aeschylns  remarks that this word is not used properly but when apply'd to the prayers offer'd to  Minerva  for  Minerva  is the only Goddess to whom prayers are made with loud cries she being the Goddess of War to other Deities they offer prayer with thanksgiving    Thus also in the th book of the  Iliads  verse  They fill the dome with supplicating cries  And in the present passage in the  Odyssey      c  Dacier  L  VERSE  Sweet  Polycaste  took the pleasing toil  To bathe the Prince  c  It is very necessary to say something about this practice of women bathing and anointing men it frequently occurs thro' the whole  Odyssey  and is so contrary to the usage of the moderns as to give offence to modesty neither is this done by women of inferior quality but we have here a young Princess bathing anointing and cloathing the naked  Telemachus Eustathius  indeed tells us it was undoubtedly by her father's command but if it was a piece of immodesty it does not solve the objection whoever commanded it I confess it would be immodest in these ages of the world and the only excuse that occurs to me is to say that Custom establish'd it It is in manners in some degree as in dress if a fashion never so indecent prevails yet no person is ridiculous because it is fashionable so in manners if a practice prevails universally tho' not reconcilable to real modesty yet no person can be said to be immodest who comes into it because it is agreeable to the custom of the times and countries  VERSE c  The conclusion of the book    I shall lay together what I have further to observe on the conclusion of this book It is remarkable that the Poet does not amuse himself in describing the present he receiv'd from  Nestor  or the provisions for the journey or even the journey it self at large he dispatches the whole in a few lines very judiciously he carries his Heroe directly to  Menelaus  who is to furnish many incidents that contribute to the design of the Poem and passes over other matters as unnecessary  We have here likewise a piece of poetical Geography and learn that it is exactly two days journey from  Pyle  to  Lacedaemon  This book takes up three days the first is spent in the enquiries  Telemachus  makes of  Nestor  concerning  Ulysses  the two last in the morning sacrifice at  Pylos  and in the journey of  Telemachus  to  Lacedaemon  so that five days have now pass'd since the opening  of the Poem I have said nothing about the sacrifice tho' it be the most exact description of the sacrifices as practis'd by the Ancients perhaps extant in any Author I refer to the observations upon the first book of the  Iliad  I would here remark that the three first books are written with the utmost simplicity there has been no room for such exalted strokes of Poetry as are to be found in the  Iliad  or in the future parts of the  Odyssey  But this is not owing to the decay of genius in  Homer  as some Critics have affirm'd who look upon the  Odyssey  as bearing marks of his declining years but to the nature of the subject The characters of  Achilles  and  Ulysses  are both very great but very different The  Iliad  consists of battles and a continual commotion the  Odyssey  in Patience and Wisdom and consequently the style of the two Poems must be as different as the characters of the two Heroes A noble fountain of Poetry opens in the next book and flows with an uninterrupted course almost through the whole  Odyssey  THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  The ARGUMENT  Telemachus  with  Pisistratus  arriving at  Sparta  is hospitably receiv'd by  Menelaus  to whom he relates the cause of his coming and learns from him many particulars of what befel the  Greeks  since the destruction of  Troy  He dwells more at large upon the Prophecies of  Proteus  to him in his return from which he acquaints  Telemachus  that  Ulysses  is detain'd in the Island of  Calypso  In the meantime the Suitors consult to destroy  Telemachus  in his voyage home  Penelope  is appriz'd of this but comforted in a dream by  Pallas  in the shape of her sister  Ipthima  WK  PFsc  THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY  _AND now proud  Sparta  with their wheels resounds  Sparta  whose walls a range of hills surrounds  At the fair dome their rapid labour ends  Where sate  Atrides  'midst his

loudacclaiming  Greeks  the victor bless'd  Then soon th'invaders of his bed and throne  Their love presumptuous shall with life atone  With patient ear oh royal youth attend  The storied labours of thy father's friend  Fruitful of deeds the copious tale is long  But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue  Learn what I heard the seaborn Seer relate  Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate  Long on th'  Aegyptian  coast by calms confin'd  Heav'n to my fleet refus'd a prosp'rous wind  No vows had we prefer'd nor victim slain  For this the Gods each sav'ring gale restrain  Jealous to see their high behests obey'd  Severe if men th' eternal rights evade  High o'er a gulphy sea the  Pharian  Isle  Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing  Nile  Her distance from the shore the course begun  At dawn and ending with the setting sun  A gally measures when the stiffer gales  Rise on the poop and fully stretch the sails  There anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lye  Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply  And now the twentieth sun descending laves  His glowing axle in the western waves  Still with expanded sails we court in vain  Propitious winds to waft us o'er the main  And the pale mariner at once deplores  His drooping vigour and exhausted stores  When lo a bright caerulean form appears  The fair  Eidothea  to dispel my fears  Proteus  her sire divine With pity press'd  Me sole the daughter of the deep address'd  Whattime with hunger pin'd my absent mates  Roam the wild Isle in search of rural cates  Bait the barb'd steel and from the fishy flood  Appease th' afflictive fierce desire of food  Whoe'er thou art the azure Goddess cries  Thy conduct ill deserves the praise of wise  Is death thy choice or misery thy boast  That here inglorious on a barren coast  Thy brave associates droop a meagre train  With famine pale and ask thy care in vain  Struck with the kind reproach I strait reply  Whate'er thy title in thy native sky  A Goddess sure for more than mortal grace  Speaks thee descendent of etherial race  Deem not that here of choice my fleet remains  Some heav'nly pow'r averse my stay constrains  O piteous of my fate vouchsafe to shew  For what's sequester'd from celestial view  What pow'r becalms th'innavigable seas  What guilt provokes him and what vows appease  I ceas'd when affable the Goddess cry'd  Observe and in the truths I speak confide  Th'oraculous Seer frequents the  Pharian  coast  From whose high bed my birth divine I boast  Proteus  a name tremendous o'er the main  The delegate of  Neptune  's watry reign  Watch with insidious care his known abode  There fast in chains constrain the various God  Who bound obedient to superior force  Unerring will prescribe your destin'd course  If studious of your realms you then demand  Their state since last you left your natal land  Instant the God obsequious will disclose  Bright tracks of glory or a cloud of woes  She ceas'd and suppliant thus I made reply  O Goddess on thy aid my hopes rely  Dictate propitious to my duteous ear  What arts can captivate the changeful Seer  For perilous th' assay unheard the toil  T' elude the prescience of a God by guile  Thus to the Goddess mild my suit I end  Then she Obedient to my rule attend  When thro' the Zone of heav'n the mounted sun  Hath journey'd half and half remains to run  The Seer while Zephyrs curl the swelling deep  Basks on the breezy shore in grateful sleep  His oozy limbs Emerging from the wave  The  Phocae  swift surround his rocky cave  Frequent and full the consecrated train  Of  Amphitrite  her whose azure trident awes the main  There wallowing warm th'enormous herd exhales  An oily steam and taints the noontide gales  To that recess commodious for surprize  When purple light shall next suffuse the skies  With me repair and from thy warrior band  Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command  Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil  For strong the God and perfected in guile  Stretch'd on the shelly shore he first surveys  The flouncing herd ascending from the seas  Their number summ'd repos'd in sleep profound  The scaly charge their guardian God surround  So with his batt'ring flocks the careful swain  Abides pavilion'd on the grassy plain  With pow'rs united obstinately bold  Invade him couch'd amid the scaly fold  Instant he wears elusive of the rape  The mimic force of every savage shape  Or glides with liquid lapse a murm'ring stream  Or wrapt in flame he glows at every limb  Yet still retentive with redoubled might  Thro' each vain passive form constrain his flight  But when his native shape resum'd he stands  Patient of conquest and your cause demands  The cause that urg'd the bold attempt declare  And sooth the vanquish'd with a victor's pray'r  The bands relax'd implore the Seer to say  What godhead interdicts the wat'ry way  Who strait propitious in prophetic strain  Will teach you to repass th' unmeasur'd main  She ceas'd and bounding from the shelfy shore  Round the descending nymph the waves redounding roar  High rapt in wonder of the future deed  With joy impetuous to the port I speed  The wants of nature with repast suffice  'Till night with grateful shade involv'd the skies  And shed ambrosial dews Fast by the deep  Along the tented shore in balmy sleep  Our cares were lost When o'er the eastern lawn  In saffron robes the Daughter of the dawn  Advanc'd her rosy steps before the bay  Due ritual honours to the Gods I pay  Then seek the place the seaborn nymph assign'd  With three associates of undaunted mind  Arriv'd to form along th' appointed strand  For each a bed she scoops the hilly sand  Then from her azure car the finny spoils  Of four vast  Phocae  takes to veil her wiles  Beneath the finny spoils extended prone  Hard toil the prophet's piercing eye to shun  New from the corse the scaly frauds diffuse  Unsavoury stench of oil and brackish ooze  But the bright seamaid's gentle pow'r implor'd  With nectar'd drops the sick'ning sense restor'd  Thus 'till the sun had travel'd half the skies  Ambush'd we lie and wait the bold emprise  When thronging thick to bask in open air  The flocks of Ocean to the strand repair  Couch'd on the sunny sand the monsters sleep  Then  Proteus  mounting from the hoary deep  Surveys his charge unknowing of deceit  In order told we make the sum compleat  Pleas'd with the false review secure he lies  And leaden slumbers press his drooping eyes  Rushing impetuous forth we strait prepare  A furious onset with the sound of war  And shouting seize the God our force t'evade  His various arts he soon resumes in aid  A Lion now he curls a surgy mane  Sudden our bands a spotted Pard restrain  Then arm'd with tusks and lightning in his eyes  A Boar's obscener shape the God belies  On spiry volumes there a Dragon rides  Here from our strict embrace a Stream he glides  And last sublime his stately growth he rears  A Tree and welldissembled foliage wears  Vain efforts with superior

way  What vows repentant will the Pow'r appease  To speed a prosp'rous voyage o'er the seas  To  Jove  with stern regard the God replies  And all th' offended synod of the skies  Just hecatombs with due devotion slain  Thy guilt absolv'd a prosp'rous voyage gain  To the firm sanction of thy fate attend  An exile thou nor cheering face of friend  Nor sight of natal shore nor regal dome  Shalt yet enjoy but still art doom'd to roam  Once more the  Nile  who from the secret source  Of  Jove  's high seat descends with sweepy force  Must view his billows white beneath thy oar  And altars blaze

our host  Whom I with  Nestor  on the  Phrygian  coast  Embracing left Must I the warriors weep  Whelm'd in the bottom of the monstrous deep  Or did the kind domestic friend deplore  The breathless heroes on their native shore  Press not too far reply'd the God but cease  To know what known will violate thy peace  Too curious of their doom with friendly woe  Thy breast will heave and tears

ancient Critics reproached  Homer  for an indecency in making  Telemachus  take his abode with  Menelaus  and not with his own grandfather  Icarius  this Monsieur  Dacier  sufficiently answers by shewing that  Icarius  had settled himself in  Acarnania  and not in  Lacedaemon  II  VERSE  invoking  Hymen  's pow'r    Athenaeus  has been very severe upon this passage as  Eustathius  observes and  Dacier  from  Eustathius  Aristarchus  says  Athenaeus  misguides us the words  led him into an error whereas the marriage is compleated the wedded couples gone away from  Menelaus  and he and  Helen  are alone at  Lacedaemon  The five verses continues he  the fifteenth to the twentieth inclusively are taken from the th book of the  Iliads  and inserted very improperly in this place by  Aristarchus Athenaeus  gives several reasons for his opinion as that music and dancing were very contrary to the severe manners of the  Lacedaemonians  besides the dance was a  Cretan  dance how then could it be practis'd among the  Spartans  The Poet mentions neither the name of the Bard nor one word of the subject of the songs neither can the words  be apply'd at all to the Dancers but to the Musicians and lastly it is not to be imagin'd that  Telemachus  and  Pisistratus  should be so unpolite as not to be at all affected with the music had there been any and yet break out into such wonder at the sight of the beauty of the Palace of  Menelaus Aristarchus  adds he thought the description of the wedding of the son and daughter of a King was too meanly and concisely describ'd and therefore made this addition  But it is easy to refute  Athenaeus  and vindicate  Aristarchus Athenaeus  understood  and  in the wrong sense they are of the imperfect  he was sending  or  about to send  and not  had sent  c If the marriage had been absolutely finish'd why should  Minerva  absent her self from  Menelaus  when the celebration of the nuptials is the only reason of the absence of that Goddess and as for music and dancing being contrary to the severe manners of the  Lacedaemonians  this is all conjecture  Menelaus  lived more than three hundred years before  Lycurgus  and because such diversions were forbid in  Sparta  in the days of  Lycurgus  must it follow that they were not used in those of  Menelaus  And should it be granted that music and dancing were not used in his times might he not relax a little from the severity of his times upon such an occasion of joy as the marriage of a son and daughter I am sure these diversions are not more contrary to the severity of the  Spartans  than the magnificence of the Palace of  Menelaus  was to their simplicity  "But he does not name the Bard or the subject of his songs"  But is this a reason why the verses are spurious we should rather admire the judgment of the Poet who having so fair an opportunity to  describe these nuptials yet rejects the temptation dismisses the whole in a few lines and follows where his subject leads him The objection about the dance being  Cretan  is not more valid  Menelaus  as we learn from the preceding book had been in  Crete  and might bring it thence to  Lacedaemon  And as for the Criticism upon  it is but a fallacy  Casaubon  has shewn beyond contradiction that  is apply'd indifferently to all those who give example to others and consequently may be apply'd to Dancers as well as Musicians It may be further added that although it should be allow'd that the word  is only properly apply'd to music yet in this place the word would not be improperly apply'd to dancers for the dancers without usurping upon the province of the singer might  or chuse those songs to which they desired to dance as is the usage at this day  Diodorus  is of opinion that the whole twelve lines after the second to the fifteenth are not genuine but what has been said of  Athenaeus  may be apply'd to  Diodorus  III  VERSE  Menelaus  blames  Eteoneus  This is the first appearance of  Menelaus  and surely nothing can more reconcile him to the favour of the spectators than those amiable colours in which the Poet paints him There is an overflow of humanity and gratitude in his expressions like that of  Dido  in  Virgil    Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco  They contain a fine piece of morality and teach that those men are more tenderhearted and humane who have felt the reverse of fortune than those who have only liv'd in a condition of prosperity  IV  VERSE  Softwhisp'ring thus to  Nestor  's son    This may be thought a circumstance of no importance and very trivial in  Telemachus  but it shews his address and decency He whispers to avoid the appearance of a flatterer or to conceal his own inexperience in shewing too much surprize at the magnificence of the Palace of  Menelaus  Eustathius  V  VERSE  The Monarch took the word  c  The ancients says  Eustathius  observe the prudence of  Menelaus  in his reply to  Telemachus  and the prudence of  Telemachus  in his behaviour to  Menelaus Menelaus  denies not his riches and magnificence but to take off the envy which they might attract he throws the calamities he has undergone into the contrary scale and balances his felicity with his misfortunes And  Telemachus  coming into the Palace at the time of an entertainment chuses to satisfie his curiosity rather than his appetite  Plutarch  I confess condemns  Telemachus  of inexperience who when he saw the Palace of  Nestor  furnish'd only with things useful to life as beds tables  c  is seiz'd with no admiration but the superfluities of  Menelaus  his ivory amber and gold  c  carry him into transports whereas a  Socrates  or a  Diogenes  would have exclaim'd What heaps of vanities have I beheld 'Tis true such a judgment might become Philosophers but who as  Dacier  observes can think the character of a  Socrates  or a  Diogenes  suitable to young  Telemachus  What is decent in a Prince and a young man would ill become the gravity and wisdom of a Philosopher  VI  VERSE  Thro' regions fatten'd with the flows of  Nile  Next  Aethiopia  c    The words are in the original  others read  them  from their veracity in oracles for which they were very famous and indeed the word  is not necessary it being used in the very same sentence tho' it must be confess'd such repetitions are frequent in  Homer  There is also a different reading of the word  some have it  or  Blacks  others  but the common reading is thought the best The  Erembri  are the  Arabian  Troglodytes  Strabo  informs us that in former ages the bounds of the  Aethiopians  lay near to  Thebes  in  Aegypt  so that  Menelaus  travelling to  Thebes  might with ease visit the  Aethiopians  Others have without any foundation imagin'd that he pass'd the streights of  Gibraltar  and sail'd to the  Indies Sidon  is the capital of the  Phaenicians  Eustathius  VII  VERSE  Where each revolving year  The teeming Ewes  c  These sheep as describ'd by  Homer  may be thought the creation of the Poet and not the production of nature But  Herodotus  says  Eustathius  writes that in  Scythia  the oxen have no horns thro' the extremity of the cold He quotes this very verse rightly intimating adds  Herodotus  that in hot regions the horns of cattle shoot very speedily  Aristotle  directly asserts that in  Libya  the young ones of horned cattle have horns immediately after they are brought into the world So that  Aristotle  and  Herodotus  vindicate  Homer  The Poet adds that the sheep breed three times in the year these words may have a different interpretation and imply that they breed in three seasons of the year and not only in the spring as in other countries or that the sheep have at once three lambs but the first is the better interpretation  Athenaeus  upon this passage writes that there are things in other countries no less strange than what  Homer  relates of these sheep of  Libya  Thus in  Lusitania  a country of  Spain  now  Portugal  there is a wonderful fruitfulness in all cattle by reason of the excellent temper of the air the fruits there never rot and the roses violets  and asparagus never fail above three months in the year  Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  The best of brothers  a traitress wife  Menelaus  neither mentions  Agamemnon    Clytemnestra  nor  Aegysthus  by name a just indignation and resentment is the occasion of his suppressing the names of  Clytemnestra  and  Aegysthus  Thro' the whole  Iliad Menelaus  is describ'd as a very affectionate brother and the love he bears  Agamemnon  is the reason why he passes by his name in silence We see that he dispatches the whole in one verse and a half  Nestor  had told the story pretty largely in the preceding book and as he was a person less nearly concern'd might speak of it with more ease and better temper than  Menelaus  the Poet avoids a needless repetition and a repetition too of a story universally known to all the  Greeks  The death of  Agamemnon  is distributed into four places in the  Odyssey    Nestor    Menelaus    Proteus  and the shade of  Agamemnon  in the th book all relate it and every one very properly  Proteus  as a prophet more fully than  Nestor  or  Menelaus  and  Agamemnon  more fully than them all as being best acquainted with it  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  My wars the copious theme  c  In the original  Menelaus  says  I have destroy'd a house  c There is an ambiguity in the expression as  Eustathius  observes for it may either signify the  house of  Priam or his own in  Argos  if it be understood of his own then the meaning is  "I have indeed great wealth but have purchas'd it with the loss of my people I could be content with the third part of it if I could restore those to life who have perish'd before  Troy  "  If it be understood of the kingdom of  Priam  the regret he shews will still appear the  greater He is enumerating his domestic happiness and his forein conquest of  Troy  but he throws the destruction of so many brave men who fell before it in the contrary scale and it so far outweighs both his wealth and his glory that they both are joyless to him Either of these interpretations shew an excellent temper of humanity in  Menelaus  who thinks the effusion of blood too dear a price for glory At the same time the Poet gives an admirable picture of human nature which is restless in the pursuit of what it miscalls happiness and when in possession of it neglects it But the disquiet of  Menelaus  arises not from inconstancy of temper but wisdom it shews that all happiness is unsatisfactory  X  VERSE  But oh  Ulysses  c    It is with admirable address that the Poet falls into his subject it is art but yet it seems to be nature This conduct has a double effect it takes away all suspicion of flattery for  Menelaus  is ignorant that the person with whom he discourses is  Telemachus  this gives him a manifest evidence of the love he bears to  Ulysses  the young man could not but be pleased with the praise of his father and with the sincerity of it It is also observable that  Menelaus  builds his friendship for  Ulysses  upon a noble foundation I mean the sufferings which  Ulysses  underwent for his friend  Menelaus  ascribes not their affection to any familiarity or Intercourse of entertainments but to a more sincere cause to the hazards which brave men undertake for a friend In short the friendship of  Menelaus  and  Ulysses  is the friendship of Heroes  Eustathius  XI  VERSE  Bright  Helen  grac'd the room    Menelaus  conjectur'd that the person he had entertain'd was the son of  Ulysses  from the tears he shed at the name of his father and from the resemblance there was between  Ulysses  and  Telemachus  it  might therefore have been expected that  Menelaus  should immediately have acknowledg'd  Telemachus  and not delay'd a full discovery one moment out of regard to his absent friend but  Menelaus  defers it upon a twofold account to give some time to  Telemachus  to indulge his sorrow for his father and recover himself from it and also to avoid the repetition of a discovery upon the appearance of  Helen  who would be curious to know the condition of the strangers  It may be necessary to say something concerning  Helen  that fatal beauty that engag'd  Greece  and  Asia  in arms she is drawn in the same colours in the  Odyssey  as in the  Iliad  it is a vicious character but the colours are so admirably soften'd by the art of the Poet that we pardon her infidelity  Menelaus  is an uncommon instance of conjugal affection he forgives a wife who had been false to him and receives her into a full degree of favour But perhaps the Reader might have been shock'd at it and prejudiced against  Helen  as a person that ought to be forgot or have her name only mention'd to disgrace it The Poet therefore to reconcile her to his Reader brings her in as a penitent condemning her own infidelity in very strong expressions she shews true modesty when she calls herself impudent and by this conduct we are inclined like  Menelaus  to forgive her  XII  VERSE c  Adraste Alcippe Helen  's Maids    It has been observ'd that  Helen  has not the same attendants in the  Odessey  as she had in the  Iliad  they perhaps might be  Trojans  and consequently be left in their own country or rather it was an act of prudence in  Menelaus  not to suffer those servants about her who had been her attendants and confidents in her infidelity  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  The grace and air  Of young  Telemachus  It may seem strange that  Helen  should at first view recollect the features of  Ulysses  in  Telemachus  and that  Menelaus  who was better acquainted with him and his constant friend should not make the same observation But  Athenaeus  to reconcile this to probability says that women are curious and skilful observers of the likeness of children to parents for one particular reason that they may upon finding any dissimilitude have the pleasure of hinting at the Unchastity of others  XIV  VERSE  For his abode a Capital prepar'd    The Poet puts these words in the mouth of  Menelaus  to express the sincerity of his friendship to  Ulysses  he intended him all advantage and no detriment we must therefore conclude that  Ulysses  was still to retain his sovereignty over  Ithaca  and only remove to  Argos  to live with so sincere a friend as  Menelaus  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  A gust of grief began to rise  c  It has been observ'd thro' the  Iliad  and may be observ'd through the whole  Odyssey  that it was not a disgrace to the greatest Heroes to shed tears and indeed I cannot see why it should be an honour to any man to be able to divest himself of humane nature so far as to appear insensible upon the most affecting occasions No man is born a Stoic it is art not nature tears are only a shame when the cause from whence they flow is mean or vicious Here  Menelaus  laments a friend  Telemachus  a father  Pisistratus  a brother but from what cause arise the tears of  Helen  It is to be remember'd that  Helen  is drawn in the softest colours in the  Odyssey  the character of the adultress is lost in that of the penitent the name of  Ulysses  throws her into tears because she is the occasion of all the sufferings of that brave man the Poet makes her the first in sorrow as she is the cause of all their tears  XVI  VERSE  Let not your roof with echoing grief resound  Now for the feast the friendly howl is crown'd  It may be ask'd why sorrow for the dead should be more unseasonable in the evening than the morning  Eustathius  answers lest others should look upon our evening tears as the effect of wine and not of love to the dead  Intempestiores venit inter pocula fletus  Nee lacrymas dulci fas est miscere falerno  I fancy there may be a more rational account given of this expression The time of feasting was ever look'd upon as a time of joy and thanksgiving to the Gods it bore a religious veneration among the Ancients and consequently to shed tears when they should express their gratitude to the Gods with joy was esteem'd a prophanation  XVII  VERSE  Bright  Helen  mix'd a mirthinspiring bowl  c  The conjectures about this cordial of  Helen  have been almost infinite Some take  Nepenthes  allegorically to signify History Music or Philosophy  Plutarch  in the first of the  Symposiacs  affirms it to be discourse well suiting the present passions and conditions  of the hearers  Macrobius  is of the same opinion  Delinimentum illud quod Helena vino miscuit non herba fuit non ex Indiâ succus sed narrandi opportunitas quae hospitem maeroris oblitum flexit ad gaudium  What gave a foundation to this fiction of  Homer  as  Dacier  observes might be this  Diodorus  writes that in  Aegypt  and chiefly at  Heliopolis  the same with  Thebes  where  Menelaus  sojourn'd as has been already observ'd there lived women who boasted of certain potions which not only made the unfortunate forget all their calamities but drove away the most violent sallies of grief or anger  Eusebius  directly affirms that even in his time the women of  Diospolis  were able to calm the rage of grief or anger by certain potions Now whether this be truth or fiction it fully vindicates  Homer  since a Poet may make use of a prevailing tho' false opinion  Milton  mentions this  Nepenthes  in his excellent Masque of  Comus  Behold this cordial Julep here  That flames and dances in his chrystal bounds  Not that  Nepenthes  which the wife of  Thone  In  Aegypt  gave to  Jove  born  Helena  Is of such pow'r as this to stir up joy  To life so friendly or so cool to thirst  But that there may be something more than fiction in this is very probable since the  Aegyptians  were so notoriously skill'd in physick and particularly since this very  Thon  or  Thonis  or  Thoon  is reported by the ancients to have been the inventor of physic among the  Aegyptians  The description of this  Nepenthes  agrees admirably with what we know of the qualities and effects of  Opium  It is further said of  Thon  that he was King of  Canopus  and entertain'd  Menelaus  hospitably before he had seen  Helen  but afterwards falling in love with her and offering violence he was slain by  Menelaus  From his name the  Aegyptians  gave the name of  Thoth  to the first month of their year and also to a city the name of  Thonis Aelian  writes that  Menelaus  when he travell'd  to the  Aethiopians  committed  Helen  to the protection of  Thonis  that she fell in love with him that  Polydamna  growing jealous confin'd her to the Island  Pharos  but gave her an herb to preserve her from the poison of serpents there frequent which from  Helen  was call'd  Helenium Strabo  writes that at  Canopus  on the mouth of  Nile  there stands a city named  Thonies  from King  Thonis  who receiv'd  Helen  and  Menelaus Herodotus  relates that  Thonis  was Governor of  Canopus  that he represented the injury which  Paris  had done to  Menelaus  to  Proteus  who reign'd in  Memphis  Eustathius  This last remark from  Herodotus  is sufficient to shew that  Homer  is not so fictitious as is generally imagined that there really was a King named  Proteus  that the Poet builds his fables upon truth and that it was truth that originally determin'd  Homer  to introduce  Proteus  into his Poetry but I intend to explain this more largely in the story of  Proteus  XVIII  VERSE  My self  Will tell  Ulysses'  bold exploit    What is here related shews the necessity of the introduction of  Helen  and the use the Poet makes of it she is not brought in merely as a  muta Persona  to fill up the number of persons but she relates several incidents in which she her self was concern'd and which she could only know and consequently not only diversisies but carries on the design of the story  Eustathius  XIX  VERSE  Seam'd o'er with wounds  c  The Poet here shews his judgment in passing over many instances of the sufferings of  Ulysses  and relating this piece of conduct not mention'd by any other Author The art of  Ulysses  in extricating himself from difficulties is laid down as the groundwork of the Poem he is  and this is an excellent example of it This further  shews the necessity of the appearance of  Helen  no other person being acquainted with the story If this stratagem be not a reality yet it bears the resemblance of it and  Megabysus  the  Persian  as  Eustathius  observes practis'd it as we learn from history We may reasonably conjecture that  Ulysses  was committed to  Helen  in hopes that he would discover the affairs of the army more freely to her than any other person for what could be more agreeable to a  Greek  than to be committed to the care of a  Greek  as  Ulysses  was to  Helen  By the same conduct the Poet raises the character of  Helen  by making her shew her repentance by an act of generosity to her countryman The original says she gave an oath to  Ulysses  not to discover him before he was in Safety in the  Grecian  army Now this does not imply that she ever discover'd to the  Trojans  that  Ulysses  had enter'd  Troy  the contrary opinion is most probable for it cannot be imagin'd but all  Troy  must have been incens'd greatly against her had they known that she had conceal'd one of their mortal enemies and dismiss'd him in safety It was sufficient for  Ulysses  to take her oath that she would not discover him 'till he was in security he left her future conduct to her own discretion It is probable that she furnish'd  Ulysses  with a sword for in his return he slew many  Trojans  He came to  Troy  observes  Eustathius  in rags and like a slave and to have conceal'd a sword would have endanger'd his life upon a discovery of it and given strong suspicions of an impostor  XX  VERSE  Exploring then the secrets of the state    The word  is here used in a large sense it takes in all the observations  Ulysses  made during his continuance in  Troy  it takes in the designs and counsels of the enemy his measuring the gates the height of the walls the easiest plan for an assault or ambush the taking away the  Palladium  or whatever else a wise man may be suppos'd to observe or act in execution of such a stratagem  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  For then with dire remorse  c  The conclusion of this speech is very artful  Helen  ascribes her seduction to  Venus  and mentions nothing of  Paris  Instead of naming  Troy  she conceals it and only says she was carry'd thither leaving  Troy  to the imagination of  Menelaus  she suffers not herself to mention names so odious now to herself and ever to  Menelaus  as  Paris  and  Troy  She compliments  Menelaus  very handsomely and says that he wanted no accomplishment either in mind or body It being the nature of man not to resent the injuries of a wife so much upon the account of her being corrupted but of the preference she gives to another person he looks upon such a preference as the most affecting part of the injury  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE  Menelaus  's answer    The judgment of the Poet in continuing the story concerning  Ulysses  is not observ'd by any Commentator  Ulysses  is the chief Heroe of the Poem every thing should have a reference to him otherwise the narration stands still without any advance towards the conclusion of it The Poet therefore to keep  Ulysses  in our minds dwells upon his sufferings and adventures he supplies his not appearing in the present scene of Action by setting his character before us and continually forcing his prudence patience and valour upon our observation He uses the same art and judgment with relation to  Achilles  in the  Iliads  The Heroe of the Poem is absent from the chief scenes of action during much of the time which that Poem comprises but he is continually brought into the mind of the Reader by recounting his exploits and glory  XXIII  VERSE  Some Daemon anxious for the  Trojan  doom    It is the observation of  Eustathius  that these words are very artfully introduced to vindicate  Helen  They imply that what she acted was by compulsion and to evidence this more clearly  Deiphobus  is given her for an attendant as a spy upon her actions that she might not conceal any thing that should happen but act her part well by endeavouring to deceive the  Greeks  in favour of  Troy  It is the Daemon not  Helen  that is in fault this continues  Eustathius  answers many objections that lye against  Helen  for if she was a real penitent as she her self affirms how comes she to endeavour to deceive the  Greeks  by the disguise of her voice into more misery than had yet arisen from a ten years war Or indeed is it credible that any person could modulate her voice so artfully as to resemble so many voices And how could the  Greeks  enclosed in the wooden horse believe that their wives who were in  Greece  could be arriv'd in so short a space as they had been conceal'd there from the various regions of  Greece  and meet together in  Troy  Would the wives of these Heroes come into an enemy's country when the whole army except these latent Heroes were retir'd from it this is ridiculous and impossible I must confess there is great weight in these objections But  Eustathius  answers all by the interposition of the Daemon and by an idle tradition that  Helen  had the name of  Echo  from the faculty of mimicking sounds and that this gift was bestow'd upon her by  Venus  when she married  Menelaus  that she might be able to detect him if he should prove false to her bed by imitating the voice of the suspected person but  Menelaus  had more occasion for this faculty than  Helen  As for the excuse of the Daemon it equally excuses all crimes For instance was  Helen  false to  Menelaus  The Daemon occasion'd it Does she act an imposture to destroy all her  Grecian  friends and even  Menelaus  The Daemon compells her to it The Daemon compells her to go with  Deiphobus  to surround the horse thrice to sound the  sides of it to endeavour to surprize the latent  Greeks  by an imition of the voices of their wives and in short to act like a person that was very sincere in mischief  Dacier  takes another course and gives up  Helen  but remarks the great address of  Menelaus Helen  had said she long desired nothing so much as to return to  Lacedaemon  and her heart had long been wholly turn'd to  Menelaus Menelaus  is not at all convinc'd of this pretended sincerity but it would have been too gross after he had taken her again to his bed to convict her of falshood He therefore contents himself barely to reply that some Daemon an enemy to the  Greeks  had forc'd her to a conduct disagreeable to her sincerity This continues  Dacier  is an artful but severe Irony  As for the objection concerning the impossibility of the  Greeks  believing their wives could be in  Troy  she answers that the Authors of this objection have not sufficiently consider'd human nature The voice of a belov'd person might of a sudden and by surprize draw from any person a word involuntary before he has time to make reflection This undoubtedly is true where circumstances make an imposture probable but here is an impossibility it is utterly impossible to believe the wives of these Heroes could be in  Troy  Besides  Menelaus  himself tells us that even he had fallen into the snare but  Ulysses  prevented it this adds to the incredibility of the story for if this faculty of mimickry was given upon his marriage with  Helen  it was nothing new to him he must be suppos'd to be acquainted with it and consequently be the less liable to surprize Nay it is not impossible but the experiment might have been made upon him before  Helen  fled away with  Paris  In short I think this passage wants a further vindication the circumstances are low if not incredible  Virgil  the great imitator of  Homer  has given us a very different and more noble description of the destruction of  Troy  he has not thought fit to imitate him in this description  If we allow  Helen  to act by compulsion to have fear'd the  Trojans  and that  Deiphobus  was sent as a spy upon her actions yet this is no vindication of her conduct she still acts a mean part and thro' fear becomes an accomplice in endeavouring to betray and ruin the  Greeks  I shall just add that after the death of  Paris    Helen  married  Deiphobus  that the story of the wooden horse is probably founded upon the taking of  Troy  by an engine call'd a Horse as the like engine was call'd a Ram by the  Romans  XXIV  VERSE  Heav'ns would a soft inglorious dastard train    Menelaus  is fir'd with indignation at the injuries offer'd his friend by the Suitors he breaks out into an exclamation and in a just contempt vouchsafes not to mention them he thinks he fully distinguishes whom he intends by calling them  those cowards  The comparison which he introduces is very just they are the Fawns  Ulysses  is the Lion  This is the first Simile that  Homer  has inserted in the  Odyssey  but I cannot think it proceeded from a barrenness of invention or thro'phlegm in the declension of his years as some have imagin'd The nature of the Poem requires a difference of stile from the  Iliad  The  Iliad  rushes along like a torrent the  Odyssey  flows gently on like a deep stream with a smooth tranquility  Achilles  is all fire  Ulysses  all wisdom  The Simile in  Homer  is really beautiful but in  Hobbs  ridiculous  As when a stag and hind ent'ring the den  Of th' absent Lion lulls his whelps with tales  Of hills and dales the Lion comes agen  And tears them into pieces with his nails  Can any thing be more foreign to the sense of  Homer  or worse translated He construes  by telling stories of  hills and dales to the Lion's whelps instead of  Juga investigat  but such mistakes are so frequent in  Hobbs  that one would almost suspect his learning in  Greek  he has disgraced the best Poet and a very great Historian  Homer  and  Thucydides  XXV  VERSE  As when contending on the  Lesbian  shore    The Poet here gives an account of one of  Ulysses  's adventures  Philomelides  was King of  Lesbos  and  Eustathius  observes that there was a tradition that  Ulysses  and  Diomedes  slew him and turn'd a stately monument he had rais'd for himself into a public place for the reception of strangers  XXVI  VERSE  The  Pharian  Isle    This description of  Pharos  has given great trouble to the Critics and Geographers it is generally concluded that the distance of  Pharos  is about seven Stadia from  Alexandria    Ammianus Marcellinus  mentions this very passage thus  lib    Insula Pharos ubi Protea cum Phocarum gregibus diversatum Homerus fabulatur inflatius a civitatis littore mille passibus disparata  or  about a mile distant from the shores  How then comes  Homer  to affirm it to be distant a full day's sail  Dacier  answers that  Homer  might have heard that the  Nile  continually bringing down much earthy substance had enlarg'd the continent and knowing it not to be so distant in his time took the liberty of a Poet and describ'd it as still more distant in the days of  Menelaus  But  Dacier  never sees a mistake in  Homer  Had his Poetry been worse if he had describ'd the real distance of  Pharos  It is allowable in a Poet to disguise the truth to adorn his story but what ornament has he given his Poetry by this enlargement  Bochart  has fully prov'd that there is no accession to the Continent from any substance that the  Nile  brings down with it  the violent agitation of the seas prohibit it from lodging and forming it self into solidity  Eratosthenes  is of opinion that  Homer  was ignorant of the mouths of  Nile  but  Strabo  answers that his silence about them is not an argument of his ignorance for neither has he ever mention'd where he was born But  Strabo  does not enter fully into the meaning of  Eratosthenes    Eratosthenes  does not mean that  Homer  was ignorant of the mouths of  Nile  from his silence but because he places  Pharos  at the distance of a whole day's sail from the Continent The only way to unite this inconsistence is to suppose that the Poet intended to specify the  Pelusiac  mouth of  Nile  from which  Pharos  stands about a day's sail but this is submitted to the Critics  I can't tell whether one should venture to make use of the word  Nile  in the translation it is doubtless an Anachronism that name being unknown in the times of  Homer  and  Menelaus  when the  Nile  was call'd  Aegyptus Homer  in this very book    Yet on the other hand this name of  Aegyptus  is so little known that a common Reader would scarce distinguish the river from the country and indeed universal custom has obtain'd for using the  Latin  name instead of the  Grecian  in many other instances which are equally anachronisms Witness all the names of the Gods and Goddesses throughout  Homer Jupiter  for  Zeus    Juno  for  Erè    Neptune  for  Posidaon  c  XXVII  VERSE  Bait the barb'd steel and from the fishy flood    Menelaus  says hunger was so violent among his companions that they were compell'd to eat fish  Plutarch  in his  Symposiacs  observes that among the  Aegyptians    Syrians  and  Greeks  to abstain from fish was esteem'd a piece of sanctity that tho' the  Greeks  were encamp'd upon the  Hellespont  there is not the least intimation  that they eat fish or any seaprovision and that the companions of  Ulysses  in the th book of the  Odyssey  never fought for fish till all their other provisions were consum'd and that the same necessity compell'd them to eat the herds of the Sun which induced them to taste fish No fish is ever offer'd in sacrifice The  Pythagoreans  in particular command fish not to be eaten more strictly than any other animal Fish afford no excuse at all for their destruction they live as it were in another world disturb not our air consume not our fruits or injure the waters and therefore the  Pythagoreans  who were unwilling to offer violence to any animals fed very little or not at all on fishes I thought it necessary to insert this from  Plutarch  because it is an observation that explains other passages in the sequel of the  Odyssey  XXVIII  VERSE  Proteus  a name tremendous o'er the main    Eustathius  enumerates various opinions concerning  Proteus  some understand  Proteus  allegorically to signify the first matter which undergoes all changes others make him an emblem of true friendship which ought not to be settled till it has been try'd in all shapes others make  Proteus  a picture of a flatterer who takes up all shapes and suits himself to all forms in compliance to the temper of the person whom he courts The  Greeks  observes  Diodorus  imagin'd all these metamorphoses of  Proteus  to have been borrow'd from the practices of the  Aegyptian  Kings who were accustom'd to wear the figures of Lions Bulls or Dragons in their diadems as emblems of Royalty and sometimes that of Trees  c  not so much for ornament as terror Others took  Proteus  to be an enchanter and  Eustathius  recounts several that were eminent in this art as  Cratisthenes  the  Phliasian  which  Dacier  renders by mistake  Callisthenes  the  Physician  who when he pleased could appear all on fire and assume other appearances to the astonishment of the spectators such also was  Xenophon    Scymnus  of  Tarentum    Philippides  of  Syracuse    Heraclitus  of  Mitylene  and  Nymphodorus  all practisers of magical arts and  Eustathius  recites that the  Phocae  were made use of in their Incantations Some write that  Proteus  was an  Aegyptian  tumbler who could throw himself into variety of figures and postures others a Stageplayer others that he was a great General skill'd in all the arts and stratagems of war  Dacier  looks upon him to have been an enchanter or  'Tis certain from  Herodotus  that there was in the times of  Menelaus  a King named  Proteus  who reign'd in  Memphis  that  Aegypt  was always remarkable for those who excell'd in magical Arts thus  Jannes  and  Jambres  chang'd at least in appearance a rod into a Serpent and water into blood It is not therefore improbable but that  Menelaus  hearing of him while he was in  Aegypt  went to consult him as an Enchanter which kind of men always pretended to foreknow events This perhaps was the real foundation of the whole story concerning  Proteus  the rest is the fiction and embellishment of the Poet who ascribes to his  Proteus  whatever the credulity of men usually ascribes to Enchanters  XXIX  VERSE  But when his native shape resum'd  c  This is founded upon the practice of Enchanters who never give their answers till they have astonish'd the imagination of those who consult them with their juggling delusions  Dacier  XXX  VERSE  And shouting seize the God    Proteus  has thro' the whole story been describ'd as a God who knew all things it may then be ask'd how comes it that he did not foreknow the violence that was design'd against his own person and is it not a contradiction that he who knew  Menelaus  without information should not know that he lay in ambush to seize him The only answer that occurs to me is that these enchanters never  pretend to have an inherent foreknowledge of events but learn things by magical arts and by recourse to the secrets of their profession so that  Proteus  having no suspicion had not consulted his art and consequently might be surprized by  Menelaus  So far is agreeable to the pretensions of such deluders The Poet indeed has drawn him in colours stronger than life but Poetry adds or detracts at pleasure and is allow'd frequently to step out of the way to bring a foreign ornament into the story  XXXI  VERSE  To  Jove  just Hecatombs  c  Homer  continually inculcates morality and piety to the Gods he gives in this place a great instance of the necessity of it  Menelaus  cannot succeed in any of his actions till he pays due honours to the Gods the neglect of sacrifice is the occasion of all his calamity and the performance of it opens a way to all his future prosperity  XXXII  VERSE  Nile who from the secret source  Of  Jove  's high seat descends    Homer  it must be confess'd gives the epithet  generally to all rivers if he had used it here peculiarly there might have been room to have imagin'd that he had been acquainted with the true cause of the inundations of this famous river The word  implies it For it is now generally agreed that these prodigious inundations proceed from the vast rains and the melting of the snows on the mountains of the Moon in  Aethiopia  about the autumnal Aequinox when those rains begin to fall the river by degrees increases and as they abate it decreases the word  is therefore peculiarly proper when apply'd to the  Nile  for tho' all rivers depend upon the waters that fall from the air or  yet the  Nile  more especially for when the rain ceases the  Nile  consists only of seven empty channels  XXXIII  VERSE  And to th' abyss the boaster bore    It is in the original  He dy'd having drunk the salt water  This verse has been omitted in many editions of  Homer  and the Ancients says  Eustathius  blame  Aristarchus  for not marking it as a verse that ought to be rejected the simplicity of it consists in the sense more than in the terms and it is unworthy of  Proteus  to treat the death of  Ajax  with pleasantry as he seems to do by adding  having drunk salt water  But why may not  Proteus  be suppos'd to be serious and the terms  to imply no more than that he was drown'd in waves of the ocean I know only one reason that can give any colour to the objection  viz  it's being possibly become a vulgar expression and used commonly in a ludicrous sense then indeed it is to be avoided in Poetry but it does not follow because perhaps it might be used in this manner in the days of these Critics that therefore it was so used in the days of  Homer  What was poetical in the time of the Poet might be grown vulgar in the time of the Critics  XXXIV  VERSE  So whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall  c  Dacier  translates  by  taureau  a bull and misunderstands  Eustathius  who directly says that in the d  Iliad  the Poet compares  Agamemnon  to a bull in this place to an oxe  The one was undoubtedly design'd to describe the courage and majestic port of a warrior the other to give us an image of a Prince falling in full peace and plenty    XXXV  VERSE  Or in eternal shade if cold he lyes    Proteus  in the beginning of his relation had said that  one person was alive    and remain'd enclosed by the ocean  How then comes  Menelaus  here to say Give me an account of that other person who is alive or  dead  Perhaps the sorrow which  Menelaus  conceived for his friend  Ulysses  might make him fear the worst and  Proteus  adding  enclos'd by the ocean  might give a suspicion that he was dead the words being capable of ambiguity However this be it sets the friendship of  Menelaus  in a strong light where friendship is sincere a state of uncertainty is a state of fears we dread even possibilities and give them an imaginary certainty Upon this one of the finest compliments that a Poet ever made to a patron turns that of  Horace  to  Mecaenas  in the first of the  Epodes  It may not perhaps be disagreeable to the Reader to observe that  Virgil  has borrow'd this story of  Proteus  from  Homer  and translated it almost literally  Rapine  says that  Homer  's description is more ingenious and fuller of invention but  Virgil  's more judicious I wish that Critic had given his reasons for his opinion I believe in general the plan of the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  is allow'd by the best of Critics to be more perfect than that of the  Aeneis Homer  with respect to the unity of time has the advantage very manifestly  Rapine  confesses it and  Aristotle  proposes him as an example to all Epic Authors Where then is the superiority of judgment Is it that there are more fabulous I mean incredible stories in  Homer  than  Virgil  as that of the  Cyclops  the ships of  Alcinous    c Virgil  has imitated most of these bold fables and the story of the ships of  Alcinous  is not more incredible than the transformation of the ships of  Aeneas  But this is too large a subject to be discuss'd in the compass of these Annotations In particular passages I freely allow the preference to  Virgil  as in the descent of  Aeneas  into hell  c  but in this story of  Proteus  I cannot see any superiority of judgment  Virgil  is little more than a translator to shew the particulars would be too tedious I refer it to the Reader to compare the two Authors and shall only instance in one passage  c  Cum clamore ruit magno manicisque jacentem  Occupat ille suae contra non immemor artis  Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum  Ignemque horribilemque feram fluviumque liquentem  c  Homer  has a manifest advantage in the occasion of the story The loss of a few bees seems to be a cause too trivial for an undertaking so great as the surprize of a Deity whereas the whole happiness of  Menelaus  depends upon this consultation of  Proteus  This is a far more important cause and consequently in this respect something more is due to  Homer  than the sole honour of an inventor  XXXVI  VERSE  Elysium  shall be thine the blissful plains  Of utmost earth  c  This is the only place in which the  Elysian  field is mention'd in  Homer  The conjectures of the Ancients are very various about it  Plato  in his  Phaed  places it in  coelo stellato  or the region of the Stars but since  Homer  fixes it  or as  Milton  expresses it at the  earth's green end  I will pass over the conjectures of others especially since the  by which others express  Elysium  confines it to this world  Strabo  says  Eustathius  places it not far from  Maurusia  that lies near the Streights It is suppos'd by  Bochart  as  Dacier  observes that the fable is of  Phaenician  extraction that  Alizuth  in  Hebrew  signifies  joy  or  exultation  which word the  Greeks  adapting to their way of pronunciation call'd  Elysius  If this be true I should come into an opinion that has much prevail'd that the  Greeks  had heard of  Paradise  from the  Hebrews  and that the  Hebrews  describing  Paradise  as a place of  Alizuth  or  joy  gave occasion to all the fables of the  Grecian Elysium  XXXVII  VERSE  Three sprightly coursers    How comes it to pass that  Menelaus  proffers  three  horses to  Telemachus  This was a compleat set among the Ancients they used one Polehorse and two leaders  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  That gift our barren rocks will render vain    This passage where  Telemachus  refuses the horses has been much observ'd and turn'd to a moral sense  viz  as a lesson to men to desire nothing but what is suitable to their conditions  Horace  has introduced it into his Epistles  Haud male Telemachus proles patientis Ulyssei  Non est aptus equis Ithacae locus ut neque planis  Porrectus spatiis nec multae prodigus herbae  Atride magis apta tibi tua dona relinquam  This is the reason why  Ulysses  as  Eustathius  observes upon the th of the  Iliads  leaves the horses of  Rhesus  to the disposal of  Diomedes  so that the same spirit of Wisdom reign'd in  Telemachus  that was so remarkable in  Ulysses  This is the reason why  Menelaus  smil'd it was not at the frankness or simplicity of  Telemachus  but it was a smile of joy to see the young Prince inherit his father's wisdom  It is the remark of  Eustathius  that  Telemachus  is far from exalting the nature of his country he confesses it to be barren and more barren than the neighbouring Islands yet that natural and laudable affection which all worthy persons have for their country makes him prefer it to places of a more happy situation This appears to me a replication to what  Menelaus  had before  offer'd concerning the transplantation of  Ulysses  to  Sparta  this is contain'd in  and then the meaning is 'Tis true  Ithaca  is a barren region yet more desirable than this country of  Lacedaemon  this  It is the more probable from the offer of horses which  Menelaus  had then made and is also another reason for the smile of  Menelaus  Eustathius  remarks that  Menelaus  tho' he has expressed the greatest friendship for  Ulysses  yet makes no offer to restore the fortunes of his friend by any military assistance tho' he had a most fair opportunity given him to repay the past kindness of  Ulysses  to his wife  Penelope  and his son  Telemachus  and how comes  Telemachus  not to ask it either of  Nestor  or  Menelaus  He answers that this depended upon the uncertainty they were yet under concerning the life of  Ulysses  But the truer reason in my opinion is that the nature of Epic Poetry requires a contrary conduct The Heroe of the Poem is to be the chief agent and the reestablishment of his fortunes must be owing to his own wisdom and valour I have enlarg'd upon this already so that there is no occasion in this place to insist upon it  XXXIX  VERSE  For ambush'd close  c  We have here another use which the Poet makes of the voyage of  Telemachus Eustathius  remarks that these incidents not only diversify but enliven the Poem But it may be ask'd why the Poet makes not use of so fair an opportunity to insert a gallant action of  Telemachus  and draw him not as eluding but defeating his adversaries The answer is easy That the Suitors sail'd compleatly arm'd and  Telemachus  unprovided of any weapons and therefore  Homer  consults credibility and forbears to paint his young Heroe in the colours of a Knight in Romance who upon all disadvantages engages and defeats his opposers But then to what purpose is this ambush of the Suitors and what part of the design of the Poem is carry'd on by it The very chief aim of it To shew the sufferings of  Ulysses  He is unfortunate in all relations of life as a King  as an husband and here very eminently as a father these sufferings are laid down in the proposition of the  Odyssey  as essential to the Poem and consequently this ambush laid by the Suitors against the life of  Telemachus  is an essential ornament  XL  VERSE  The speech of  Penelope  Longinus  in particular commends this speech as a true picture of a person that feels various emotions of soul and is born by every gust of passion from sentiment to sentiment with sudden and unexpected transitions There is some obscurity in the  Greek  this arises from the warmth with which she speaks she has not leisure to explain her self fully a circumstance natural to a person in anger  Penelope  gives a very beautiful picture of  Ulysses  "The best of Princes are allow'd to have their favourites and give a greater share of affection than ordinary to particular persons But  Ulysses  was a father to all his people alike and loved them all as his children a father tho' he bears a more tender affection to one child than to another yet shews them all an equal treatment thus also a good King is not sway'd by inclination but justice towards all his subjects"  Dacier  One circumstance is very remarkable and gives us a full view of a person in anger at the very sight of  Medon Penelope  flies out into passion she gives him not time to speak one syllable but speaks her self as if all the Suitors were present and reproaches them in the person of  Medon  tho'  Medon  is just to her and  Ulysses  but anger is an undistinguishing passion What she says of ingratitude recalls to my memory what is to be found in  Laertius    Aristotle  being ask'd what thing upon earth soonest grew old reply'd  an Obligation    respondit      XLI  VERSE  Ride the wild waves    Were this passage to be render'd literally it would run thus  climb the swift ships which are horses to men on the seas Eustathius  observes the allusion is very just and that the only doubt is whether it be brought in opportunely by  Penelope  it may be doubted if the mind could find leisure to introduce such allusions  Dacier  answers that  Penelope  speaks thus thro' indignation The grief that she conceives at the hardiness of men in finding out a way to pass the seas as well as land furnished her with these figures very naturally for figures are agreeable to passion  XLII  VERSE  And Isles remote enlarge his old domain    Dacier  offers a Criticism upon these last words of  Euryclea  It cannot be imagin'd that these fertile fields can be spoken of  Ithaca    Plutarch  's description of it is entirely contradictory to this  "  Ithaca  says he is rough and mountainous fit only to breed goats upon cultivation it scarce yields any fruits and these so worthless as scarce to recompence the labour of gathering"  Homer  therefore by this expression intended the other dominions of  Ulysses  such as  Cephalenia    c  But I question not that the whole dominions of  Ulysses  are included  Ithaca  as well as  Cephalenia  for tho'  Ithaca  was mountainous yet the vallies were fruitful according to the description of it in the th of the  Odyssey  The rugged soil allows no level space  For flying chariots or the rapid race  Yet not ungrateful to the Peasant's pain  Suffices fulness to the swelling grain  The loaded trees their various fruits produce  And clustring grapes afford a gen'rous juice  c  As for her remark upon  it is of no validity the word stands in opposition to  and implies no more than  here  or at a distance in general  XLIII  VERSE  The Suitors heard and deem'd the mirthful voice  A signal of her hymenaeal choice    It may be ask'd whence this conjecture of the Suitors arises  Penelope  is describ'd as weeping grievously and fainting away and yet immediately the Suitors conclude she is preparing for the Nuptials  Eustathius  answers that undoubtedly the Suitors understood the Queen had purify'd her self with water and supplicated the Goddess  Minerva  tho' the Poet omits the relation of such little particularities But whence is it that the Poet gives a greater share of wisdom to  Euryclea  than to  Penelope Penelope  commands a servant to fly with the news of the absence of  Telemachus  to  Laertes  which could not at all advantage  Telemachus  and only grieve  Laertes Euryclea  immediately diverts her from that vain intention advises her to have recourse to heaven and not add misery to the already miserable  Laertes  This is Wisdom in  Euryclea  But it must be confess'd that the other is Nature in  Penelope Euryclea  is calm  Penelope  in a passion and  Homer  would have been a very bad painter of human Nature if he had drawn  Penelope  thus heated with passion in the mild temper of  Euryclea  grief and resentment give  Penelope  no time to deliberate whereas  Euryclea  is less concern'd and consequently capable of thinking with more tranquillity  XLIV  VERSE  With rebuke severe  Antinous  cry'd    Antinous  speaks thus in return to what had been before said by one of the Suitors concerning  Telemachus    viz  "the Queen little imagines that her son's death approaches"  he fears lest  Penelope  should know their intentions and hinder their measures by raising the subjects of  Ithaca  that still retain'd their fidelity  Dacier  XLV  VERSE  So when the woodman's toyl  c  The Poet to shew the majesty and high spirit of  Penelope  compares her to a Lioness He manages the allusion very artfully he describes the Lioness not as exerting any dreadful act of violence for such a comparison is only proper to be apply'd to a Heroe but inclosed by her enemies which at once shews both her danger and nobleness of spirit under it It is in the  Greek  which may signify either a circle of toils or nets or a circle of enemies The former is perhaps preferable as corresponding best with the condition of  Penelope  who was surrounded with the secret ambushes and snares of the Suitors  Eustathius  XLVI  VERSE  Minerva  lifelike on imbody'd air  Imprest the form  c  We have here an imaginary Being introduc'd by the Poet The whole is manag'd with great judgment It is short because it has not a direct and immediate relation to the progress of the Poem and because such imaginary entercourses have ever been looked upon as sudden in appearance and as sudden in vanishing away The use the Poet makes of it is to relieve  Penelope  from the extremity of despair that she may act her part in the future scenes with courage and constancy We see it is  Minerva  who sends this phantom to  Penelope  to comfort her Now this is an allegory to express that as soon as the violence of sorrow was over the mind of  Penelope  return'd to some degree of tranquillity  Minerva  is no more than the result of her own reflection and wisdom which banish'd from her breast those melancholy apprehensions The manner likewise of its introduction is not less judicious the mind is apt to dwell upon those objects in sleep which make a deep impression when awake This is the foundation of the Poet's fiction it is  no more than a dream which he here describes but he cloaths it with a body gives it a momentary existence and by this method exalts a low circumstance into dignity and Poetry  XLVII  VERSE  And with consummate woe  c  In the original  Penelope  says plainly she is more concern'd for her son than her husband I shall translate  Dacier  's observation upon this passage We ought not to reproach  Penelope  for this seemingly shocking declaration in preferring a son to an husband Her sentiment is natural and just she had all the reason in the world to believe that  Ulysses  was dead so that all her hopes all her affection was entirely placed upon  Telemachus  His loss therefore must unavoidably touch her with the highest degree of sensibility if he is lost she can have recourse to no second comfort But why may we not allow the reason which  Penelope  her self gives for this superiority of sorrow for  Telemachus  "  Telemachus  says she is unexperienc'd in the world and unable to contend with difficulties whereas  Ulysses  knew how to extricate himself upon all emergencies"  This is a sufficient reason why she should fear more for  Telemachus  than  Ulysses  Her affection might be greater for  Ulysses  than  Telemachus  yet her fears might be stronger for the son than the husband  Ulysses  being capable to surmount dangers by experience  Telemachus  being new to all difficulties  XLVIII  VERSE  Enquire not of his doom  c  It may be ask'd what is the reason of this conduct and why should the Phantom refuse to relate any thing concerning the condition of  Ulysses Eustathius  answers that if the Phantom had related the full truth of the story the Poem had been at an end the very constitution of it requires that  Ulysses  should arrive unknown to all but chiefly to his wife as will appear in the prosecution of  the story The question is very natural for an affectionate wife to make concerning an absent husband but this being an improper place for the discovery the Poet defers the solution of it 'till the unravelling of the whole in the conclusion of the Poem  The action of this book takes up the space of two nights and one day so that from the opening of the Poem to the introduction of  Ulysses  are six days compleated  But how long a time  Telemachus  afterwards stay'd with  Menelaus  is a question which has employ'd some modern  French  Critics one of which maintains that he stay'd no longer than these two nights at  Lacedaemon  But it is evident from the sequel of the  Odyssey  that  Telemachus  arriv'd again at  Ithaca  two days after  Ulysses  but  Ulysses  was twenty nine days in passing from  Ogygia  to  Ithaca  and consequently during that whole time  Telemachus  must have been absent from  Ithaca  The ground of that Critick's mistake was from the silence of  Homer  as to the exact time of his stay which was of no importance being distinguish'd by no action and only in an Episodical part The same thing led me into the like error in the d Note on the second book where it is said that  Telemachus  return'd to  Ithaca  in less than twelve days  The End of the First
