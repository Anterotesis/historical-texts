OLIVER SURFACE  JOSEPH SURFACE  CHARLES  ROWLEY  SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE  CRABTREE  MOSES  SNAKE  TRIP  SIR TOBY BUMPER  GENTLEMEN  SERVANT TO JOSEPH SURFACE  SERVANT TO LADY SNEERWELL  WOMEN  LADY TEAZLE  MARIA  LADY SNEER WELL  MRS CANDOUR  MAID TO LADY TEAZLE  THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL  ACT I  SCENE Lady SNEERWELL'S House  Lady  SNEERWELL  and  SNAKE  discovered at a teatable  Lady SNEERWELL  THE paragraphs you say Mr Snake were all inserted  Snake  They were Madam and as I copied them myself in a seigned hand there can be no suspicion from whence they came  L  Sneerwell  Did you circulate the report of Lady Brittle's intrigue with Captain Boastall  Snake  That's in as fine a train as your Ladyship could wish in the common course of things I think it must reach Mrs Clacket's ears within twentyfour hours and then the business you know is as good as done  L  Sneerwell  Why yes Mrs Clacket has talents and a great deal of industry  Snake  True Madam and has been tolerably successful in her day to my knowledge she has been the cause of six matches being broken off and three sons disinherited of four forced elopments as many close confinements nine separate maintenances and two divorces nay I have more than once traced her causing a  tete a tete  in the Town and Country Magazine  when the parties never saw one another before in the whole course of their lives  L  Sneerwell  Why yes she has genius but her manner is too gross  Snake  True Madam she has a fine tongue and a bold invention but then her colouring is too dark and the outlines rather too extravagant she wants that delicacy of hint and mellowness of sneer which distinguishes your Ladyship's scandal  L  Sneerwell  You are partial Snake  Snake  Not in the least every body will allow that Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or look than many others with the most laboured detail even though they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their side to support it  L  Sneerwell  Yes my dear Snake and I'll not deny the pleasure I feel at the success of my schemes    both rise    wounded myself in the early part of my life by the envenomed tongue of slander I confess nothing can give me greater satisfaction than reducing others to the level of my own injured reputation  Snake  True Madam but there is one affair in which you have lately employed me wherein I confess I am at a loss to guess at your motives  L  Sneerwell  I presume you mean with regard to my friend Sir Peter Teazle and his family  Snake  I do here are two young men to whom Sir Peter has acted as guardian since their father's death the eldest possessing the most amiable character and universally well spoken of the youngest the most dissipated wild extravagant young fellow in the world the former an avowed admirer of your Ladyship and apparently your favourite the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward and confessedly admired by her Now  on the face of these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable to me why you the widow of a city Knight with a large fortune should not immediately close with the passion of a man of such character and expectation as Mr Surface and more so why you are so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attachment subsisting between his brother Charles and Maria  L  Sneerwell  Then at once to unravel this mystery I must inform you that love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr Surface and me  Snake  No  L  Sneerwell  No his real views are to Maria or her fortune while in his brother he finds a favoured rival he is therefore obliged to mask his real intentions and profit by my assistance  Snake  Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself for his success  L  Sneerwell  Heavens how dull you are can't you surmise a weakness I have hitherto through shame concealed even from you Must I confess it that Charles that profligate that libertine that bankrupt in fortune and reputation that he it is for whom I am thus anxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice every thing  Snake  Now indeed your conduct appears consistent but pray how came you and Mr Surface so confidential  L  Sneerwell  For our mutual interest he pretends to and recommends sentiment and liberality but I know him to be artful close and malicious In short a sentimental knave while with Sir Peter and indeed with most of his acquaintances he passes for a youthful miracle of virtue good sense and benevolence  Snake  Yes I know Sir Peter vows he has not his fellow in England and has praised him as a man of character and sentiment  L  Sneerwell  Yes and with the appearance of being sentimental he has brought Sir Peter to favour his addresses to Maria while poor Charles has no friend in the house though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's heart against whom we must direct our schemes  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Mr Surface Madam  L Sneerwell  Shew him up    exit Servant    he generally calls about this hourI don't wonder at people's giving him to me for a lover  Enter  JOSEPH SURFACE  Joseph  Lady Sneerwell good morning to you Mr Snake your most obedient  L  Sneerwell  Snake has just been rallying me upon our attachment but I have told him our real views I need not tell you how useful he has been to us and believe me our confidence has not been ill placed  Joseph  Oh Madam 'tis impossible for me to suspect a man of Mr Snake's merit and accomplishments  L  Sneerwell  Oh no compliments but tell me when you saw Maria or what's more material to us your brother  Joseph  I have not seen either since I left you but I can tell you they never met some of your stories have had a good effect in that quarter  L  Sneerwell  The merit of this my dear Snake belongs to you but do your brother's distresses increase  Joseph  Every hour I am told he had another execution  in his house yesterdayin short his dissipation and extravagance exceeds any thing I ever heard  L  Sneerwell  Poor Charles  Joseph  Aye Poor Charles indeed notwithstanding his extravagance one cannot help pitying him I wish it was in my power to be of any essential service to him for the man who does not feel for the distresses of a brother even though merited by his own misconduct deserves to be  L  Sneerwell  Now you are going to be moral and forget you are among friends  Joseph  Gad so I was ha haI'll keep that sentiment till I see Sir Peter ha ha however it would certainly be a generous act in you to rescue Maria from such a libertine who if he is to be reclaimed at all can only be so by a person of your superior accomplishments and understanding  Snake  I believe Lady Sneerwell here's company coming I'll go and copy the letter I mentioned to your Ladyship Mr Surface your most obedient  Exit Snake  Joseph  Mr Snake your most obedient I wonder Lady Sneerwell you would put any confidence in that fellow  L  Sneerwell  Why so  Joseph  I have discovered he has of late had several conferences with old Rowley who was formerly my father's steward he has never you know been a friend of mine  L  Sneerwell  And do you think he would betray us  Joseph  Not unlikely and take my word for it Lady Sneerwell that fellow has not virtue enough to be faithful to his own villanies  Enter  MARIA  L  Sneerwell  Ah Maria my dear how do you do What's the matter  Maria  Nothing Madam only this odious lover of mine Sir Benjamin Backbite and his uncle Crabtree just called in at my guardian's but I took the first opportunity to slip out and run away to your Ladyship  L  Sneerwell  Is that all  Joseph  Had my brother Charles been of the party you would not have been so much alarmed  L  Sneerwell  Nay now you are too severe for I dare say the truth of the matter is Maria heard you was here and therefore came but pray Maria what particular objection have you to Sir Benjamin that you avoid him so  Maria  Oh Madam he has done nothing but his whole conversation is a perpetual libel upon all his acquaintance  Joseph  Yes and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing him for he would abuse a stranger as soon as his best friend and his uncle is as bad  Maria  For my part I own wit looses its respect with me when I see it in company with malice what think you Mr Surface  Joseph  To be sure Madamto smile at a jest that plants a thorn in the breast of another is to become a principal in the mischief  L  Sneerwell  Pashthere is no possibility of being witty without a little ill nature the malice in a good thing is the barb that makes it stickWhat is your  real  opinion Mr Surface  Joseph  Why my opinion is that where the spirit  of railery is suppressed the conversation must be naturally insipid  Maria  Well I will not answer how far slander may be allowed but in a man I am sure it is despicable We have pride envy rivalship and a thousand motives to depreciate each other but the male slanderer must have the cowardice of a woman before he can traduce one  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Mrs Candour Madam if you are at leisure will leave her carriage  L  Sneerwell  Desire her to walk up    Exit servant    Now Maria here's a character to your taste though Mrs Candour is a little talkative yet every body allows she is the best natured sort of woman in the world  Maria  Yeswith the very gross affectation of good nature she does more mischief than the direct malice of old Crabtree  Joseph  Faith it's very true and whenever I hear the current of abuse running hard against the characters of my best friends I never think them in such danger as when Candour undertakes their defence  L Sneerwell  Hush Hush here she is  Enter Mrs  CANDOUR  Mrs  Candour  Oh my dear Lady Sneerwell well how do you do Mr Surface your most obedientIs there any news abroad No nothing good I suppose No nothing but scandalnothing but scandal  Joseph  Just so indeed Madam  Mrs  Candour  Nothing but scandalAh Maria how do you do child what is every thing at an end between you and Charles What he is too extravagant Aye the town talks of nothing else  Maria  I am sorry Madam the town is so ill employed  Mrs  Candour  Aye so am I childbut what can one do we can't stop people's tonguesThey hint too that your guardian and his Lady don't live so agreeably together as they did  Maria  I am sure such reports are without foundation  Mrs  Candour  Aye so these things generally are It's like Mr Fashion's affair with Colonel Goterie though indeed that affair was never rightly cleared up and it was but yesterday Miss Prim assured me that Mr and Mrs Honeymoon were now become mere man and wife like the rest of their acquaintance She likewise hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her dropsy and recovered her shape in a most surprizing manner  Joseph  The licence of invention some people give themselves is astonishing  Mrs  Candour  'Tis sobut how will you stop people's tongues 'Twas but yesterday Mrs Clacket informed me that our old friend Miss Prudely was going to elope and that her guardian caught her just stepping into the York Diligence with her dancingmaster I was informed too that Lord Flimsey caught his wife at a house of no extraordinary fame and that Tom Saunter and Sir Harry Idle were to measure swords on a similar occasionBut I dare say there is no truth in the story and I would not circulate such a report for the world  Joseph  You reportNo no no  Mrs  Candour  No notalebearers are just as bad as the talemakers  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Sir Benjamin Backbite and Mr Crabtree  Exit servant  Enter Sir  BENJAMIN  and  CRABTREE  Crabtree  Lady Sneerwell your most obedient humble servant Mrs Candour I believe you don't know my nephew Sir Benjamin Backbite he has a very pretty taste for poetry and shall make a rebus or a cherard with any one  Sir  Benjamin  Oh fie uncle  Crabtree  In faith he will did you ever hear the lines he made at Lady Ponto's route on Miss Frizzle's feathers catching fire and the rebuseshis first is the name of a fish the next a great naval commander and  Sir  Benjamin  Uncle now prythee  L  Sneerwell  I wonder Sir Benjamin you never publish any thing  Sir  Benjamin  Why to say the truth 'tis very vulgar to printand as my little productions are chiefly satyrs and lampoons on particular persons I find they circulate better by giving copies in confidence to the friends of the partieshowever I have some love elegies which when favoured by this Lady's smiles    to Maria    I mean to give to the public  Crabtree  'Foregad Madam they'll immortalize you    to Maria    you will be handed down to posterity like Petrarch's Laura or Waller's Sacharissa  Sir  Benjamin  Yes Madam I think you'll like them    to Maria    when you shall see them on a beautiful quarto type where a neat rivulet of text shall murmur through a meadow of margin'foregad they'll be the most elegant things of their kind  Crabtree  But odso Ladies did you hear the news  Mrs  Candour  Whatdo you mean the report of  Crabtree  No Madam that's not itMiss Nicely going to be married to her footman  Mrs  Candour  Impossible  Sir  Benjamin  'Tis very true indeed Madam every thing is fixed and the wedding liveries bespoke  Crabtree  Yes and they do say there were very pressing reasons for it  Mrs  Candour  I heard something of this before  L  Sneerwell  Oh it cannot be and I wonder they'd report such a thing of so prudent a Lady  Sir  Benjamin  Oh but Madam that is the very reason that it was believed at once for she has always been so very cautious and reserved that every body was sure there was some reason for it at bottom  Mrs  Candour  It is true there is a sort of puny sickly reputation that would outlive the robuster character of an hundred prudes  Sir  Benjamin  True Madam there are Valetudinarians in reputation as well as constitution who being conscious of their weak part avoid the least breath of air and supply their want of stamina by care and circumspection  Mr  Candour  I believe this may be some mistake you know Sir Benjamin very trifling circumstances have often given rise to the most ingenious tales  Crabtree  Very truebut odso Ladies did you hear of Miss Letitia Piper's losing her lover and her character at ScarboroughSir Benjamin you remember it  Sir  Benjamin  Oh to be sure the most whimsical circumstance  L  Sneerwell  Pray let us hear it  Crabtree  Why one evening at Lady Spadille's assembly the conversation happened to turn upon the difficulty of breeding NovaScotia sheep in this country no says a lady present I have seen an instance of it for a cousin of mine Miss Letitia Piper had one that produced twins What what says old Lady Dundizzy whom we all know is as deaf as a post has Miss Letitia Piper had twinsThis you may easily imagine set the company in a loud laugh and the next morning it was every where reported and believed that Miss Letitia Piper had actually been brought to bed of a fine boy and girl  Omnes  Ha ha ha ha  Crabtree  'Tis true upon my honourOh Mr Surface how do you do I hear your uncle Sir Oliver is expected in town sad news upon his arrival to hear how your brother has gone on  Joseph  I hope no busy people have already prejudiced his uncle against himhe may reform  Sir  Benjamin  True he may for my part I never thought him so utterly void of principle as people sayand though he has lost all his friends I am told nobody is better spoken of amongst the Jews  Crabtree  'Foregad if the Old Jewry was a ward Charles would be an Alderman for he pays as many annuities as the  ish Tontine and when he is sick they have prayers for his recovery in all their Synagogues  Sir  Benjamin  Yet no man lives in greater splendor They tell me when he entertains his friends he can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his own securities have a score of tradesmen waiting in the antichamber and an officer behind every guest's chair  Joseph  This may be entertaining to you gentlemen  but you pay very little regard to the feelings of a brother  Maria  Their malice is intolerable    Aside    Lady Sneerwell I must wish you a good morning I'm not very well  Exit Maria  Mrs  Candour  She changes colour  L  Sneerwell  Do Mrs Candour follow her  Mrs  Candour  To be sure I willpoor dear girl who knows what her situation may he  Mrs Candour follows her  L  Sneerwell  'Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear Charles reflected on notwithstanding their difference  Sir  Benjamin  The young lady's penchant is obvious  Crabtree  Come don't let this dishearten you follow her and repeat some of your odes to her and I'll assist you  Sir  Benjamin  Mr Surface I did not come to hurt you but depend on't your brother is utterly undone  Crabtree  Oh undone as ever man wascan't raise a guinea  Sir  Benjamin  Every thing is sold I am told that was moveable  Crabtree  Not a moveable left except some old bottles and some pictures and they seem to be framed in the wainscot egad  Sir  Benjamin  I am sorry to hear also some bad stories of him  Crabtree  Oh He has done many mean things that's certain  Sir  Benjamin  But however he's your brother  Crabtree  Aye as he's your brotherwe'll tell you more another opportunity  Sir  Benjamin  Yes as he's your brotherwell tell you more another opportunity  Exeunt Crabtree and sir Benjamin  L  Sneerwell  'Tis very hard for them indeed to leave a subject they have not quite run down  Joseph  And I fancy their abuse was no more acceptable to your ladyship than to Maria  L  Sneerwell  I doubt her affections are further engaged than we imaginebut the family are to be here this afternoon so you may as well dine where you are we shall have an opportunity of observing her furtherin the mean time I'll go and and plot mischief and you shall study  Exeunt  SCENE Sir PETER TEAZLE'S House  Sir PETER  WHEN an old batchelor marries a young wise what is he to expect'Tis now about six months since my Lady Teazle made me the happiest of menand I have been the most miserable dog ever sinceWe tifted a little going to church and fairly quarrelled before the bells were done ringing I was more than once nearly choaked with gall during the honey moon and had lost every satisfaction in life before my friends had done wishing me joyAnd yet I chose with caution a girl bred wholly in the country who had never known luxury beyond one silk gown or dissipation beyond the annual gala of a race ball Yet now she plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies of the town with as good a grace is if she had never seen a bush or a grass plot out of GrosvenorSquare I am sneered at by all my acquaintance  paragraphed in the newspapersshe dissipates my fortune and contradicts all my humoursAnd yet the worst of it is I doubt I love her or I should never bear all thisbut I am determined never to be weak enough to let her know itNo no no  Enter  ROWLEY  Rowley  Sir Peter your servant how do you find yourself today  Sir  Peter  Very bad Master Rowley very bad indeed  Rowley  I'm sorry to hear thatwhat has happened to make you uneasy since yesterday  Sir  Peter  A pretty question truly to a married man  Rowley  Sure my Lady is not the cause  Sir  Peter  Why has any one told you she was dead  Rowley  Come come Sir Peter notwithstanding you sometimes dispute and disagree I am sure you love her  Sir  Peter  Aye Master Rowley but the worst of it is that in all our disputes and quarrels she is ever in the wrong and continues to thwart and vex me I am myself the sweetest tempered man in the world and so I tell her an hundred times a day  Rowley  Indeed Sir Peter  Sir  Peter  Yesand then there's Lady Sneerwell and the set she meets at her house encourage her to disobedience and Maria my ward she too presumes to have a will of her own and refuses the man I propose for her designing I suppose to bestow herself and fortune upon that profligate his brother  Rowley  You know Sir Peter I have often taken the liberty to differ in opinion with you in regard to these two young men for Charles my life on't will  retrieve all one day or otherTheir worthy father my once honoured master at his years was full as wild and extravagant as Charles now is but at his death he did not leave a more benevolent heart to lament his loss  Sir  Peter  You are wrong Mr Rowley you are very wrongby their father's will you know I became guardian to these young men which gave me an opportunity of knowing their different dispositions but their uncle's Eastern liberality soon took them out of my power by giving them an early independence But for Charles whatever good qualities he might have inherited they are long since squandered away with the rest of his fortuneJoseph indeed is a pattern for the young men of the agea youth of the noblest sentiments and acts up to the sentiments he professes  Rowley  Well well Sir Peter I shan't oppose your opinion at present though I am sorry you are prejudiced against Charles as this may probably be the most critical period of his life for his uncle Sir Oliver is arrived and now in town  Sir Peter  What my old friend Sir Oliver is he arrived I thought you had not expected him this month  Rowley  No more we did Sir but his passage has been remarkably quick  Sir  Peter  I shall be heartily glad to see him'tis sixteen years since old Noll and I metBut does he still enjoin us to keep his arrival a secret from his nephews  Rowley  He does Sir and is determined under a feigned character to make trial of their different dispositions  Sir  Peter  Ah there is no need of it for Joseph I am sure is the manBut hark'ye Rowley does Sir Oliver know that I am married  Rowley  He does Sir and intends shortly to wish you joy  Sir  Peter  What as we wish health to a friend in a consumptionBut I must have him at my house do you conduct him Rowley I'll go and give orders for his reception    going    We used to rail at matrimony togetherhe has stood firm to his textBut Rowley don't give him the least hint that my wife and I disagree for I would have him think  Heaven forgive me  that we are a happy couple  Rowley  Then you must be careful not to quarrel whilst he is here  Sir  Peter  And so we mustbut that will be impossible Zounds Rowley when an old batchelor marries a young wife he deservesaye he deserves nothe crime carries the punishment along with it  End of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE Sir PETER TEAZLE'S House  Sir PETER  LADY Teazle Lady Teazle I won't bear it  L Teazle  Very well sir Peter you may bear it or not just as you please but I know I ought to have my own way in every thing and what's more I will  Sir  Peter  What madam is there no respect due to the authority of a husband  L Teazle  Why don't I know that no woman of fashion does as she is bid after her marriageThough  I was bred in the country I'm no stranger to that if you wanted me to be obedient you should have adopted me and not married meI'm sure you were old enough  Sir  Peter  Aye there it isOons madam what right have you to run me into all this extravagance  L Teazle  I'm sure I am not more extravagant than a woman of quality ought to be  Sir  Peter  'Slife madam I'll have no more sums squandered away upon such unmeaning luxuries you have as many flowers in your dressing room as would turn the Pantheon into a greenhouse or make a Féte Champetre at a mas  L Teazle  Lord sir Peter am I to blame that flowers don't blow in cold weather you must blame the climate and not meI'm sure for my part I wish it was spring all the year round and that roses grew under our feet  Sir  Peter  Zounds madam I should not wonder at your extravagance if you had been bred to itHad you any of these things before you married me  L Teazle  Lord sir Peter how can you be angry at those little elegant expences  Sir  Peter  Had you any of those little elegant expences when you married me  L Teazle  For my part I think you ought to be pleased your wife should be thought a woman of taste  Sir  Peter  Zounds madam you had no taste when you married me  L Teazle  Very true indeed and after having married you I never should pretend to taste again  Sir  Peter  Very well very well madam you have entirely forgot what your situation was when I first saw you  L Teazle  No no I have not a very disagreeable situation it was or I'm sure I never should have married you  Sir  Peter  You forget the humble state I took you fromthe daughter of a poor country 'squirewhen I came to your father's I found you sitting at your tambour in a linen gown a bunch of keys to your side and your hair combed smoothly over a roll  L Teazle  Yes I remember very wellmy daily occupations were to overlook the dairy superintend the poultry make extracts from the family receipt book and combany aunt Deborah's lap dog  Sir  Peter  Oh I am glad to find you have so good a recollection  L Teazle  My evening employments were to draw patterns for ruffles which I had not materials to make up play at Pope Joan with the curate read a sermon to my aunt Deborah or perhaps be stuck up at an old spinnet to trum my father to sleep after a foxchace  Sir  Peter  Then you was glad to take a ride out behind the buttler upon the old dock'd coachhorse  L Teazle  No no I deny the butler and the coachhorse  Sir  Peter  I say you did This was your situation Now madam you must have your coach vizaviz and three powdered coachmen to walk before your chair and in summer two white cats to draw you to KensingtonGardens and instead of your living in that hole in the country I have brought you home here made a woman of fortune of you a woman of quality in short madam I have made you my wife  L Teazle  Well and there is but one thing more you can now do to add to the obligation and that is  Sir  Peter  To make you my widow I suppose  L Teazle  Hem  Sir  Peter  Very well madam very well I am much obliged to you for the hint  L Teazle  Why then will you force me to say shocking things to you But now we have finished our morning conversation I presume I may go to my engagements at Lady Sneerwell's  Sir  Peter  Lady Sneerwella precious acquaintance you have made with her too and the set that frequent her houseSuch a set mercy on usMany a wretch who has been drawn upon a hurdle has done less mischief than those barterers of forged lies coiners of scandal and clippers of reputation  L Teazle  How can you be so severe I'm sure they are all people of fashion and very tenacious of reputation  Sir  Peter  Yes so tenacious of it they'll not allow it to any but themselves  L Teazle  I vow sir Peter when I say an illnatured thing I mean no harm by it for I take it for granted they'd do the same by me  Sir  Peter  They've made you as bad as any of them  L Teazle  YesI think I bear my part with a tolerable grace  Sir  Peter  Grace indeed  L Teazle  Well but sir Peter you know you promised to come  Sir  Peter  Well I shall just call in to look after my own character  L Teazle  Then upon my word you must make haste after me or you'll be too late  Exit L Teazle  Sir  Peter  I have got much by my intended expostulation  What a charming air she haswhat a neck and how pleasingly she shews her contempt of my authority Well though I can't make her love me 'tis some pleasure to teaze her a little and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is doing every thing to vex and plague me  SCENE Lady SNEERWELL'S House  Enter Lady  SNEERWELL CRABTREE  Sir  BENJAMIN JOSEPH  Mrs  CANDOUR  and  MARIA  Lady SNEERWELL  NAY positively we'll have it  Joseph  Aye aye the epigram by all means  Sir  Benjamin  Oh Plague on it it's mere nonsense  Crabtree  Faith Ladies 'twas excellent for an extempore  Sir  Benjamin  But Ladies you should be acquainted with the circumstancesYou must know that one day last week as Lady Bab Curricle was taking the dust in Hyde Park in a sort of duodecimo phaeton she desires me to write some verses on her ponies upon which I took out my pocket book and in a moment produced the following  " Sure never were seen two such beautiful ponies  " Other horses are clowns and these macaronies  " To give them this title I'm sure can't be wrong  " Their legs are so slim and their tails are so long  Crabtree  There Ladiesdone in the crack of a whipand on horseback too  Joseph  Oh a very Phoebus mounted  Mrs  Candour  I must have a copy  Enter Lady  TEAZLE  L  Sneerwell  Lady Teazle how do you do  I hope we shall see sir Peter  L  Teazle  I believe he will wait on your Ladyship presently  L  Sneerwell  Maria my love you look grave come you shall sit down to picquet with Mr Surface  Maria  I take very little pleasure in cardsbut I'll do as your ladyship pleases  L  Teazle  I wonder he should sit down to cards with MariaI thought he would have taken an opportunity of speaking to me before sir Peter came  Aside  Mrs  Candour  Well now I'll forswear his society  Aside  L  Teazle  What's the matter Mrs Candour  Mrs  Candour  Why they are so censorious they won't allow our friend Miss Vermilion to be handsome  L  Sneerwell  Oh surely she's a pretty woman  Crabtree  I'm glad you think so  Mrs  Candour  She has a charming fresh colour  L  Teazle  Yes when it is fresh put on  Mrs  Candour  Well I'll swear it's natural for I've seen it come and go  L  Teazle  Yes it comes at night and goes again in the morning  Sir  Benjamin  True madam it not only goes and comes but what's more egad her maid can fetch and carry it  Mrs  Candour  Welland what do you think of her sister  Crabtree  What Mrs Evergreen'foregad she's six and fifty if she's a day  Mrs  Candour  Nay I'll swear two or three and sixty is the outsideI don't think she looks more  Sir  Benjamin  Oh there's no judging by her looks unless we could see her face  L  Sneerwell  Well if Mrs Evergreen does take some pains to repair the ravages of time she certainly effects it with great ingenuity and surely that's better than the careless manner in which the widow Oaker chalks her wrinkles  Sir  Benjamin  Nay now my Lady Sneerwell you are too severe upon the widowCome it is not that she paints so ill but when she has finished her face she joins it so badly to her neck that she looks like a mended statue in which the connisseur may see at once that the head is modern though the trunk's antique  Crabtree  What do you think of Miss Simper  Sir  Benjamin  Why she has pretty teeth  L  Teazle  Yes and upon that account never shuts her mouth but keeps it always ajar as it were thus    shews her teeth    Omnes  Ha ha ha  L  Teazle  And yet I vow that's better than the pains Mrs Prim takes to conceal her losses in front she draws her mouth till it resembles the apperture of a poor box and all her words appear to slide out edgeways as it were thus  "How do you do madamYes madam"  L  Sneerwell  Ha ha ha very well Lady Teazle I vow you appear to be a little severe  L  Teazle  In defence of a friend you know it is but justBut here comes Sir Peter to spoil our pleasantry  Enter Sir  PETER  Sir  Peter  Ladies your servantmercy upon  methe whole seta character dead at every sentence  Mrs  Candour  They won't allow good qualities to any onenot even good nature to our friend Mrs Pursey  Crabtree  What the old fat dowager that was at Mrs Quadrille's last night  Mrs  Candour  Her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her  L  Sneerwell  That's very true indeed  L  Teazle  YesI'm told she absolutely lives upon acids and small whey laces herself with pullies often in the hottest day in summer you shall see her on a little squat poney with her hair platted and turned up like a drummer and away she goes puffing round the ring in a full trot  Sir  Peter  Mercy on me this is her own relation a person they dine with twice a week  Aside  Mrs  Candour  I vow you shan't be so severe upon the dowager for let me tell you great allowances are to be made for a woman who strives to pass for a flirt at six and thirty  L  Sneerwell  Though surely she's handsome still and for the weakness in her eyes considering how much she reads by candlelight 'tis not to be wondered at  Mrs  Candour  Very true and for her manner I think it very graceful considering she never had any education for her mother you know was a Welch milliner and her father a sugarbaker at Bristol  Sir  Benjamin  Aye ye are both of ye too good natured  Mrs  Candour  Well I never will join in the ridicule of a friend so I tell my cousin Ogle and ye all know what pretensions she has  beauty  Crabtree  She has the oddest countenancea collection of features from all corners of the globe  Sir  Benjamin  She has indeed an Irish front  Crabtree  Caledonian locks  Sir  Benjamin  Dutch nose  Crabtree  Austrian lips  Sir  Benjamin  The complexion of a Spaniard  Crabtree  And teeth a la Chinoise  Sir  Benjamin  In short her face resembles a table drote at Spa where no two guests are of a nation  Crabtree  Or a Congress at the close of a general war where every member seems to have a different interest and the nose and chin are the only parties likely to join issue  Sir  Benjamin  Ha ha ha  L  Sneerwell  Ha haWell I vow you are a couple of provoking toads  Mrs  Candour  Well I vow you shan't carry the laugh solet me tell you that Mrs Ogle  Sir Peter  Madam madam 'tis impossible to stop those good gentlemens tongues but when I tell you Mrs Candour that the lady they are speaking of is a particular friend of mine I hope you will be so good as not to undertake her defence  L  Sneerwell  Well said Sir Peter but you are a cruel creature too phlegmatic yourself for a with and too peevish to allow it to others  Sir  Peter  True wit madam is more nearly allied to good nature than you are aware of  L  Teazle  True Sir Peter I believe they are so near akin that they can never be united  Sir  Benjamin  or rather madam suppose them to be man and wife one so seldom sees them together  L  Teazle  But Sir Peter is such an enemy to scandal I believe he would have it put down by Parliament  Sir  Peter  'Foregad Madam if they considered the sporting with reputations of as much consequence as poaching on manors and passed an act for the preservation of fame they would find many would thank them for the bill  L  Sneerwell  Oh ludSir Peter would deprive us of our  privileges  Sir  Peter  Yes madam and none should then have the liberty to kill characters and run down reputations but  privileged  old maids and  disappointed  widows  L  Sneerwell  Go you monster  Mrs  Candour  But surely you would not be so severe on those who only report what they hear  Sir  Peter  Yes madam I would have law for them too and wherever the drawer of the lie was not to be found the injured party should have a right to come on any of the endorsers  Crabtree  Well I verily believe there never was a scandalous story without some foundation  Sir  Peter  Nine out of ten are formed on some malicious invention or idle representation  L  Sneerwell  Come Ladies shall we sit down to cards in the next room  Enter a  SERVANT  who whispers Sir  PETER  Sir  Peter  I'll come directlyI'll steal away unperceived  Aside  L  Sneerwell  Sir Peter you're not leaving us  Sir  Peter  I beg pardon Ladies 'tis particular business and I mustbut I leave my character behind me  Exit Sir Peter  Sir  Benjamin  Well certainly Lady Teazle that  Lord of your's is a strange being I could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh heartily if he was not your husband  L  Teazle  Oh never mind thatThis way  They walk up and exeunt  Joseph  You take no pleasure in this society  Maria  How can I If to raise a malicious smile at the misfortunes and infirmities of those who are unhappy be a proof of wit and humour Heaven grant me a double portion of dulness  Joseph  And yet they have no malice in their hearts  Maria  Then it is the more inexcusable since nothing but an ungovernable depravity of heart could tempt them to such a practice  Joseph  And is it possible Maria that you can thus feel for others and yet be cruel to me alone Is hope to be denied the tenderest passion  Maria  Why will you persist to persecute me on a subject on which you have long since known my sentiments  Joseph  Oh Maria you would not be thus deaf to me but that Charles that libertine is still a favoured rival  Maria  Ungenerously urged but whatever my sentiments are with regard to that unfortunate young man be assured I shall not consider myself more bound to give him up because his misfortunes have lost him the regardseven of a brother  Going out  Joseph  Nay Maria you shall not leave me with a srown by all that's honest I swear    Kneels and sees  Lady Teazle  entering behind    Ah Lady Teazle ah you shall not stir    to Maria    I have the greatest regard in the world for Lady Teazle but if Sir Peter was once to suspect  Maria  Lady Teazle  L  Teazle  What is all this child You are wanting in the next room    Exit Maria    What is the meaning of all thisWhat did you take her for me  Joseph  Why you must knowMariaby some means suspectingthegreat regard I entertain for your Ladyshipwaswasthreateningif I did not desist to acquaint Sir Peterand IIwas just reasoning with her  L  Teazle  You seem to have adopted a very tender method of reasoningpray do you usually argue on your knees  Joseph  Why you know she's but a child and I thought a little bombast might be useful to keep her silentBut my dear Lady Teazle when will you come and give me your opinion of my library  L  Teazle  Why really I begin to think it not so proper and you know I admit you as a lover no farther than fashion dictates  Joseph  Oh no morea mere Platonic Cicisbeo that every Lady is entitled to  L  Teazle  No furtherand though Sir Peter's treatment may make me uneasy it shall never provoke me  Joseph  To the only revenge in your power  L  Teazle  Go you insinuating wretchbut we shall be missed let us join the company  Joseph  I'll follow your Ladyship  L  Teazle  Don't stay long for I promise you Maria shan't come to hear any more of your reasoning  Exit Lady Teazle  Joseph  A pretty situation I am inby gaining the wife I shall lose the heiressI at first intended to  make her Ladyship only the instrument in my designs on Maria butI don't know how it isI am become her serious admirer I begin now to wish I had not made a point of gaining so very good a character for it has brought me into so many confounded rogueries that I fear I shall be exposed at last  Exit Joseph  SCENE Sir PETER TEAZLE'S House  Enter Sir  OLIVER  and  ROWLEY  Sir  Oliver  Ha ha and so my old friend is married at last eh Rowleyand to a young wife out of the country ha ha ha That he should buff to old batchelors so long and sink into a husband at last  Rowley  But let me beg of you sir not to rally him upon the subject for he cannot bear it though he has been married these seven months  Sir  Oliver  Then he has been just half a year on the stool of repentance Poor Sir PeterBut you say he has entirely given up Charlesnever sees him eh  Rowley  His prejudice against him is astonishing and I believe is greatly aggravated by a suspicion of a connexion between Charles and Lady Teazle and such a report I know has been circulated and kept up by means of Lady Sneerwell and a scandalous party who associate at her house where as I am convinced if there is any partiality in the case that Joseph is the favourite  Sir  Oliver  Ay ay I know there are a set of mischievous prating gossips both male and female who murder characters to kill him and rob a young fellow of his good name before he has sense enough to know  the value of itbut I am not to be prejudic  against my nephew by any such I promise you No no if Charles has done nothing false or mean I shall compound for his extravagance  Rowley  I rejoice sir to hear you say so and am happy to find the son of my old master has one friend left however  Sir  Oliver  What shall I forget Mr Rowley when I was at his years myselfegad neither my brother or I were very prudent youths and yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your old master was  Rowley  'Tis that reflection I build my hopes on and my life on't Charles will prove deserving of your kindnessBut here comes Sir Peter  Enter Sir  PETER  Sir  Peter  Where is he where is Sir OliverAh my dear friend I rejoice to see youYou are welcome indeed you are welcomeyou are welcome to England a thousandand a thousand times  Sir  Oliver  Thank you thank Sir Peterand am glad to find you so well believe me  Sir  Peter  Ah Sir OliverIt's sixteen years since last we saw each othermany a bout we have had together in our time  Sir  Oliver  Aye I have had my shareBut what I find you are marriedhey old boyWell well it can't be helped and so I wish you joy with all my heart  Sir  Peter  Thank you thank youyes Sir Oliver I have entered into that happy statebut we won't talk of that now  Sir  Oliver  That's true Sir Peter old friends  should not begin upon grievances at their first meeting no no no  Rowley    Aside to Sir Oliver    Have a care Sir don't touch upon that subject  Sir  Oliver  Wellso one of my nephews I find is a wild young rogue  Sir  Peter  Oh my dear friend I grieve at your disappointment thereCharles is indeed a sad libertine but no matter Joseph will make you ample amends every body speaks well of him  Sir  Oliver  I am very sorry to hear it he has too good a character to be an honest fellowevery body speaks well of him'pshawthen he has bowed as low to knaves and fools as to the honest dignity of genius and virtue  Sir  Peter  What the plague are you angry with Joseph for not making enemies  Sir  Oliver  Why not if he has merit enough to deserve them  Sir  Peter  Well well see him and you'll be convinced how worthy he isHe's a pattern for all the young men of the ageHe's a man of the noblest sentiments  Sir  Oliver  Oh plague of his sentimentsIf he salutes me with a scrap of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directlybut don't however mistake me Sir Peter I don't mean to defend Charles's errors but before I form my judgment of either of them I intend to make a trial of their hearts and my friend Rowley and I have planned something for that purpose  Sir  Peter  My life on Joseph's honour  Sir  Oliver  Well well give us a bottle of good  wine and we'll drink your Lady's health and tell you all our schemes  Sir  Peter  Alonsdone  Sir  Oliver  And don't Sir Peter be too severe against your old friend's sonOdds my life I am not sorry he has run a little out of the coursefor my part I hate to see prudence clinging to the green suckers of youth 'tis like ivy round the saplin and spoils the growth of the tree  Exeunt omnes  End of the  SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE Sir PETER'S House  Enter Sir  PETER  Sir  OLIVER  and  ROWLEY  Sir  PETER  WELL well we'll see this man first and then have our wine afterwardsBut Rowley I don't see the jest of your scheme  Rowley  Why Sir this Mr Stanley was a near relation of their mother's and formerly an eminent merchant in Dublinhe failed in trade and is greatly reduced he has applied by letter to Mr Surface and Charles for assistancefrom the former of whom he has received nothing but fair promises while Charles in the midst of his own distresses is at present endeavouring to raise a sum of money part of which I know he intends for the use of Mr Stanley  Sir  Oliver  Ayehe's my brother's son  Rowley  Now Sir we propose that Sir Oliver shall visit them both in the character of Mr Stanley as I  have informed them he has obtained leave of his creditors to wait on his friends in personand in the younger believe me you'll find one who in the midst of dissipation and extravagance has still as our immortal Bard expresses it  A tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity  Sir  Peter  What signifies his open hand and purse if he has nothing to give But where is this person you were speaking of  Rowley  Below Sir waiting your commandsyou must know Sir Oliver this is a friendly Jew one who to do him justice has done every thing in his power to assist Charleswho waits    Enter a servant    desire Mr Moses to walk up  Exit servant  Sir  Peter  But how are you sure he'll speak truth  Rowley  Why Sir I have persuaded him there's no prospect of his being paid several sums of money he has advanced for Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver who he knows is in town therefore you may depend on his being faithful to his interestOh here comes the honest Israelite  Enter  MOSES  Sir Oliver this is Mr MosesMr Moses this is Sir Oliver  Sir  Oliver  I understand you have lately had great dealings with my nephew Charles  Moses  Yes Sir Oliver I have done all I could for himbut he was ruined before he came to me for assistance  Sir  Oliver  That was unlucky truly for you had no opportunity of shewing your talent  Moses  None at all I had not the pleasure of knowing his distresses 'till he was some thousands worse than nothing  Sir  Oliver  Unfortunate indeed But I suppose you have done all in your power for him  Moses  Yes he knows thatThis very evening I was to have brought him a gentleman from the city who does not know him and will advance him some monies  Sir  Peter  What a person that Charles has never borrowed money of before lend him any in his present circumstances  Moses  Yes  Sir  Oliver  What is the gentleman's name  Moses  Mr Premium of Crutched Friars formerly a broker  Sir  Peter  Does he know Mr Premium  Moses  Not at all  Sir  Peter  A thought strikes mesuppose Sir Oliver you was to visit him in that character 'twill be much better than the romantic one of an old relation you will then have an opportunity of s  ing Charles in all his glory  Sir  Oliver  Egad I like that idea better than the other and then I may visit Joseph afterwards as old Stanley  Rowley  Gentlemen this is taking Charles rather unawares but Moses you understand Sir Oliver and I dare say will be faithful  Moses  You may depend upon meThis is very near the time I was to have gone  Sir  Oliver  I'll accompany you as soon as you please Moses but holdI had forgot one thinghow the plague shall I be able to pass for a Jew  Moses  There is no needthe principal is a Christian  Sir  Oliver  Is he I am very sorry for itbut  then again am I not too smartly dressed to look like a moneylender  Sir  Peter  Not at allit would not be out of character if you went in your own chariot would it Moses  Moses  Not in the least  Sir  Oliver  Well but how must I talk There's certainly some cant of usury or mode of treating that I ought to know  Sir  Peter  As I take it Sir Oliver the great point is to be exorbitant in your demandsEh Moses  Moses  Yes dat is very great point  Sir  Oliver  I'll answer for't I'll not be wanting in that eight or ten  per cent  on the loan at least  Moses  Oh if you ask him no more as dat you'll be ciscovered immediately  Sir  Oliver  Hey what the plaguehow much then  Moses  that depends upon the circumstancesif he appears not very anxious for the supply you should require only forty or fifty  per cent  but if you find him in great distress and he wants money very badyou must ask double  Sir  Peter  Upon my word Sir OliverMr Premium I meanit's a very pretty trade you're learning  Sir  Oliver  Truly I think so and not unprofitable  Moses  Then you know you have not the money yourself but are forced to borrow it of a friend  Sir  Oliver  Oh I borrow it for him of a frienddo I  Moses  Yes and your friend's an unconscionable dogbut you can't help dat  Sir  Oliver  Oh my friend's an unconscionable dogis he  Moses  And then he himself has not the monies by him but is forced to sell stock at a great loss  Sir  Oliver  He's forced to sell stock at a great loss well really that's very kind of him  Sir  Peter  But hark'ye Moses if Sir Oliver was to rail a little at the annuity bill don't you think it would have a good effect  Moses  Very much  Rowley  And lament that a young man must now come to years of discretion before he has it in his power to ruin himself  Moses  Aye a great pity  Sir  Peter  Yes and abuse the public for allowing merit to a bill whose only object was to rescue youth and inexperience from the rapacious gripe of usury and to give the young heir an opportunity of enjoying his fortune without being ruined by coming into possession  Sir  Oliver  SosoMoses shall give me further instructions as we go together  Sir  Peter  You'll scarce have time to learn your trade for Charles lives but hard by  Sir  Oliver  Oh never fearmy tutor appears so able that tho Charles lived in the next street it must be my own fault if I am not a compleat rogue before I have turned the corner  Exeunt Sir Oliver and Moses  Sir  Peter  So Rowley you would have been partial and given Charles notice of our plot  Rowley  No indeed Sir Peter  Sir  Peter  Well I see Maria coming I want to have some talk with her  Exit Rowley  Enter  MARIA  So Maria what is Mr Surface come home with you  Maria  No Sir he was engaged  Sir  Peter  Maria I wish you were more sensible to his excellent qualitiesdoes not every time you are in his company convince you of the merit of that amiable young man  Maria  You know Sir Peter I have often told you that of all the men who have paid me a particular attention there is not one I would not sooner prefer than Mr Surface  Sir  Peter  Aye aye this blindness to his merit proceeds from your attachment to that profligate brother of his  Maria  This is unkind you know at your request I have forborn to see or correspond with him as I have long been convinced he is unworthy my regard but while my reason condemns his vices my heart suggests some pity for his misfortunes  Sir  Peter  Ah you had best resolve to think of him no more but give your heart and hand to a worthier object  Maria  Never to his brother  Sir  Peter  Have a care Maria I have not yet made you know what the authority of a guardian is don't force me to exert it  Maria  I know that for a short time I am to obey you as my fatherbut must cease to think you so when you would compell me to be miserable  Exit in tears  Sir  Peter  Sure never man was plagued as I am I had not been married above three weeks before her father a hale hearty man diedon purpose I believe to plague me with the care of his daughter but here comes my helpmate she seems in mighty good humour I wish I could teaze her into loving me a little  Enter  LADY TEAZLE  L  Teazle  What's the matter Sir Peter What have you done to Maria It is not fair to quarrel and I not by  Sir  Peter  Ah Lady Teazle it is in your power to put me into good humour at any time  L  Teazle  Is it I am glad of itfor I want you to be in a monstrous good humour now come do be good humoured and let me have two hundred pounds  Sir  Peter  What the plague can't I be in a good humour without paying for itbut look

Teazle  Do you You can't think Sir Peter how good humour becomes you now you look just as you did before I married you  Sir  Peter  Do I indeed  L  Teazle  Don't you remember when you used to walk with me under the elms and tell me stories of what a gallant you were in your youth and asked me if I could like an old fellow who could deny me nothing  Sir  Peter  Aye and you were so attentive and obliging to me then  L  Teazle  Aye to be sure I was and used to take your part against all my acquaintance and when my  cousin Sophy used to laugh at me for thinking of marrying a man old enough to be my father and call you an ugly stiff formal old batchelor I contradicted her and said I did not think you so ugly by any means and that I dar'd say you would make a good sort of a husband  Sir  Peter  That was very kind of youWell and you were not mistaken you have found it so have not youBut shall we always live thus happy  L  Teazle  With all my heartI'mI don't care how soon we leave off quarrellingprovided you will own you are tired first  Sir  Peter  With all my heart  L  Teazle  Then we shall be as happy as the day is long and never nevernever quarrel more  Sir  Peter  Neverneverneverand let our future contest be who shall be most obliging  L  Teazle  Aye  Sir  Peter  But my dear Lady Teazlemy love indeed you must keep a strict watch over your temper for you know my

Sophy told me  Sir  Peter  Your cousin Sophy is a forward saucy impertinent minx  L  Teazle  You are a very great bear I am sure to abuse my relations  Sir  Peter  But I am well enough served for marrying youa pert forward rural coquette who had refused half the honest 'squires in the country  L  Teazle  I am sure I was a great fool for marrying youa stiff crop dangling old batchelor who was unmarried at fifty because nobody would have him  Sir  Peter  You was very glad to have meyou never had such an offer before  L  Teazle  Oh yes I hadthere was Sir Tivey Terrier who every body said

sorry he has company at present and cannot see you  Sir  Oliver  If he knew who it is that wanted to see him perhaps he would not have sent such a message  Trip  Oh yes I told him who it wasI did not

are in the rightthe degeneracy of the age is astonishing there are many of our acquaintance who are men of wit genius and spirit but then they won't drink  Carless  True Charles they sink into the more substantial luxuries of the table and quite neglect the bottle  Charles  Rightbesides society suffers by it for instead of the mirth and humour that used to mantle over a bottle of Burgundy their conversation is become as insipid as the Spa water they drink which has all the pertness of Champaigne without its spirit or flavour  Sir  Toby  But what will you say to those who prefer play to the bottleThere's Harry Dick and Careless himself who are under a hazard regimen  Charles  'Psha no such thingWhat would you train a horse for the course by keeping him from corn Let me throw upon a bottle of Burgundy and I never lose at least I never feel my loss and that's the same thing  st Gent  True besides 'tis wine that determines if a man be really in love  Charles  So it isFill up a dozen bumpers to a dozen beauties and she that floats at the top is the girl that has bewitched you  Careless  But come Charles you have not given us your real favourite  Charles  Faith I have withheld her only in compassion to you for if I give her you must toast a round of her peers which is impossible    sighs    on earth  Careless  We'll toast some heathen deity or celestial goddess to

leave you upon businessCareless take the chair  Careless  What this is some wenchbut we won't lose you for her  Charles  No upon my honourIt is only a Jew and a broker that are come by appointment  Careless  A Jew and a broker we'll have 'em in  Charles  Then desire Mr Moses to walk in  Trip  And little Premium too Sir  Careless  Aye Moses and Premium    Exit Trip    Charles we'll give the rascals some generous Burgundy  Charles  No hang itwine but draws forth the natural qualities of a man's heart and to make them drink would only be to whet their knavery  Enter Sir  OLIVER  and  MOSES  Walk in Gentlemen walk in Trip give chairs sit down Mr Premium sit down Moses Glasses Trip come Moses I'll give you a sentiment "  Here's success to usury  " Moses fill the gentleman a bumper  Moses  "Here's success to usury"  Careless  True Charles usury is industry and deserves to succeed  Sir  Oliver  Then here's "All the success it deserves"  Careless  Oh dam'me sir that won't do you demur to the toast and shall drink it in a pint bumber at least  Moses  Oh sir consider Mr Premium is a gentleman  Carless  And therefore loves good wine and I'll see justice done to the bottleFill Moses a

annuity 'tis all the same to me  Exit with the rest  Moses  Mr Premium is a gentleman of the strictect honour and secrecy and always performs what he undertakes Mr Premium this is    formally    Charles  'Pshaw hold your tonguemy friend Moses sir is a very honest fellow but a little slow at expressionI shall cut the matter very short I'm an extravagant young fellow that wants to borrow  money and you as I take it are a prudent old fellow who has got money to lendI am such a fool as to give fifty per cent rather than go without it and you I suppose are rogue enough to take an hundred if you can get it And now we understand one another and may proceed to business without further ceremony  Sir  Oliver  Exceeding frank upon my word I see you are not a man of compliments  Charles  No Sir  Sir  Oliver  Sir I like you the better for itHowever you are mistaken in one thing I have no money to lend but I believe I could procure you some from a friend but then he's a damn'd unconscionable dog is he not Moses  Moses  Yes but you can't help that  Sir  Oliver  And then he has not the money by him▪ but must sell stock at a great loss must not he Moses  Moses  Yes indeedyou know I always speak the truth and scorn to tell a lye  Charles  Aye those who speak truth usually do And Sir I must pay the difference I supposeWhy look'ye Mr Premium I know that money is not to be had without paying for it  Sir  Oliver  Wellbut what security could you giveyou have not any land I suppose  Charles  Not a molehill nor a twig but what grows in bowpots out at the windows  Sir  Oliver  Nor any stock I presume  Charles  None but live stock and they are only a few pointers and poniesBut pray Sir are you acquainted with any of my connections  Sir  Oliver  To say the truth I am  Charles  Then you must have heard that I had a  rich old uncle in India Sir Oliver Surface from whom I have the greatest expectations  Sir  Oliver  That you have a wealthy uncle I have heard but how your expectations will turn out is more I believe than you can tell  Charles  Oh yes I'm told I am a monstrous favourite and that he intends leaving me every thing  Sir  Oliver  Indeed this is the first I have heard of it  Charles  Yes yes he intends making me his heir Does he not Moses  Moses  Oh yes I'll take my oath of that  Sir  Oliver  Egad they'll persuade me presently that I am in Bengal  Aside  Charles  Now what I propose Mr Premium is to give you a  post obiit  on my uncle's life Though indeed my uncle Noll has been very kind to me and upon my soul I shall be sincerely sorry to hear any thing has happened to him  Sir  Oliver  Not more than I should I assure you But the bond you mention happens to be the worst security you could offer me for I might live to be an hundred and never recover the principal  Charles  Oh yes you would for the moment he dies you come upon me for the money  Sir  Oliver  Then I believe I would be the most unwelcome dun you ever had in your life  Charles  What you are afraid my little Premium that my uncle is too good a life  Sir  Oliver  No indeed I am not though I have heard he's as hale and as hearty as any man of his years in Christendom  Charles  Oh there you are misinformed Nono poor uncle Oliver he breaks a pace The climate sir  has hurt his constitution and I'm told he's so much altered of late that his nearest relations don't know him  Sir  Oliver  No ha ha ha so much altered of late that his relations would not know him Ha ha ha that's droll egad  Charles  What you are pleased to hear he's on the decline my little Premium  Sir  Oliver  No I am notno no no  Charles  Yes you are for it mends your chance  Sir  Oliver  But I am told Sir Oliver is coming overnay some say he is actually arrived  Charles  Oh there you are misinformed again Nono such thinghe is this moment in Bengal What I must certainly know better than you  Sir  Oliver  Very true as you say you must know better than I though I have it from very good authority Have I

unconcern  Charles  Unconcern what I suppose you are surprized that I am not mere sorrowful at losing the company of so many worthy friends It is very distressing to be sure but you see they never

we shall have somebody call that has a better right to it  Rowley  Ah Sir I wish you would remember the proverb  Charles  "  be just before you are generous  " Why fool would if I could but justice is

so deep  Sir  Oliver  But he would not sell my picture Oh here comes Rowley  Enter  ROWLEY  Rowley  Well Sir I find you have made a purchase  Sir  Oliver  Yes our young rake has parted with his ancestors like tapestry  Rowley  And he has commissioned me to return you an hundred pounds of the purchase money but under your fictitious character of old Stanley I saw a taylor and two nosiers dancing attendance who I know will go unpaid and the two hundred pounds would just satisfy them  Sir  Oliver  Well well I'll pay his debts and his benevolence tooBut now I'm no more a broker and you shall introduce me to the elder brother as old Stanley  Enter  TRIP  Trip  Gentlemen I'm sorry I was not in the way to shew you out Hark'ye Moses  Exit with Moses  Sir  Oliver  There's a fellow

Mr Rowley in my time servants were  content with the follies of their masters when they were wore a little threadbare but now they have their vices like their birthday cloaths with their gloss on  Exeunt  SCENE the Apartments of JOSEPH SURFACE  Enter  JOSEPH and a SERVANT  JOSEPH  NO letter from Lady Teazle  Servant  No Sir  Joseph  I wonder she did not write if she could not comeI hope Sir Peter does not suspect mebut Charles's dissipation and extravagance are great points in my favour    knocking at the door    see if it is her  Servant  'Tis Lady Teazle sir but she always orders her chair to the milliner's in the next street  Joseph  Then draw that screenmy opposite neighbour is a maiden Lady of so curious a temperyou need not wait    Exit servant    My Lady Teazle I'm afraid begins to suspect my attachment to Maria but she must not be acquainted with that secret till I have her more in my power  Enter Lady  TEAZLE  L  Teazle  What sentiment in soliloquyHave you been very impatient now Nay you look so graveI assure you I came as soon as I could  Joseph  Oh madam punctuallity is a species of constancya very unfashionable custom among ladies  L Teazle  Nay now you wrong me I'm sure you'd pity me if you knew my situation    both sit    Sir Peter grows so peevish and so ill natured there's no enduring him and then to suspect me with Charles  Joseph  I'm glad my scandalous friends keep up that report  Aside  L  Teazle  For my part I wish Sir Peter to let Maria marry himWou'dn't you Mr Surface  Joseph    Aside    Indeed I would notOh to be sure and then my dear Lady Teazle would be convinced how groundless her suspicions were of my having any thoughts of the silly girl  L  Teazle  Then there's my friend Lady Sneerwell has propagated malicious stories about meand what's very provoking all too without the least foundation  Joseph  Ah there's the mischief for when a scandalous story is believed against me there's no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it  L  Teazle  And to be continually censured and suspected when I know the integrity of my own heartit would almost prompt me to give him some grounds for it  Joseph  Certainly for when a husband grows suspicious and withdraws his confidence from his wife it then becomes a part of her duty to endeavour to out wit himYou owe it to the natural privilege of your sex  L  Teazle  Indeed  Joseph  Oh yes for your husband should never be deceived in you and you ought to be frail in compliment to his discernment  L  Teazle  This is the newest doctrine  Joseph  Very wholesome believe me  L  Teazle  So the only way to prevent his suspicions is to give him cause for them  Joseph  Certainly  L  Teazle  But then the consciousness of my innocence  Joseph  Ah my dear lady Teazle 'tis that consciousness of your innocence that ruins youWhat is it that makes you imprudent in your conduct and careless of the censures of the world The consciousness of your innocenceWhat is it makes you regardless of forms and inattentive to your husband's peace Why the consciousness of your innocenceNow my dear Lady Teazel if you could only be prevailed upon to make a trifling  faux pas  you cant imagine how circumspect you would grow  L  Teazle  Do you think so  Joseph  Depend upon itYour case at present my dear Lady Teazle resembles that of a person in a plethorayou are absolutely dying of too much health  L  Teazle  Why indeed if my understanding could be convinced  Joseph  Your understandingOh yes your understanding  should  be convinced Heaven forbid that I should persuade you to any thing that is wrong No no I have too much honour for that  L  Teazle  Don't you think you may as well leave honour out of the question    both rise    Joseph  Ah I see Lady Teazle the effects of country education still remain  L  Teazle  They do indeed and I begin to find myself imprudent and if I should be brought to act wrong it would be sooner from Sir Peter's ill treatment of me than from your honourable logic I assure you  Joseph  Then by this hand which is unworthy    knowing a servant enters    What do you want you scoundrell  Servant  I beg pardon sirI thought you would not chuse Sir Peter should come up  Joseph  Sir Peter  L  Teazle  Sir Peter Oh I'm undoneWhat shall I do Hide me somewhere good Mr Logic  Joseph  Here here behind this screen    she runs behind the screen    and now reach me a book    Sits down and reads    Enter Sir  PETER  Sir  Peter  Aye there he is ever improving himself Mr Surface Mr Surface  Joseph    Affecting to gape    Oh Sir PeterI rejoice to see youI was got over a sleepy book here I am vastly glad to see youI thank you for this call I believe you have not been here since I finished my libraryBooks books you know are the only thing I am a coxcomb in  Sir  Peter  Very pretty indeedwhy even your screen is a source of knowledgehung round with maps I see  Joseph  Yes I find great use in that screen  Sir  Peter  Yes yes so you must when you want to find any thing in a hurry  Joseph  Yes or to hide any thing in a hurry  Aside  Sir  Peter  But my dear friend I want to have some private talk with you  Joseph  You need not wait  Exit servant  Sir  Peter  Pray sit down    both sit    My dear friend I want to impart to you some of my distresses In short Lady Teazle's behaviour of late has given me very great uneasiness She not only dissipates and destroys my fortune but I have strong reasons to believe she has formed an attachment elsewhere  Joseph  I am unhappy to hear it  Sir  Peter  Yes and between you and me I believe I have discovered the person  Joseph  You alarm me exceedingly  Sir  Peter  I know you would sympathize with me  Joseph  Believe me Sir Peter such a discovery would affect mejust as much as it does you  Sir  Peter  What a happiness to have a friend we can trust even with our family secretsCan't you guess who it is  Joseph  I hav'n't the most distant ideaIt can't be Sir Benjamin Backbite  Sir  Peter  No noWhat do you think of Charles  Joseph  My brother impossibleI can't think he would be guilty of such baseness and ingratitude  Sir  Peter  Ah the goodness of your own mind makes you slow to believe such villainy  Joseph  Very true Sir PeterThe man who is conscious of his own integrity of heart is very slow to credit another's baseness  Sir  Peter  And yet that the son of my old friend should practise against the honour of my family  Joseph  Aye there's the case Sir Peterwhen ingratitude barbs the dart of injury the wound feels double smart  Sir  Peter  What noble sentimentsHe never used a sentiment ungrateful boy that I acted as guardian to and who was brought up under my eye and I never in my life refused himmy advice  Joseph  I don't know Sir Peterhe may be such a manif it be so he is no longer a brother of mine I renounce him I disclaim himFor the man who can break through the laws of hospitality and seduce the wife or daughter of his friend deserves to be branded as a pest to society  Sir  Peter  And yet Joseph if I was to make it public I should only be sneered and laughed at  Joseph  Why that's very trueNo no you must not make it public people would talk  Sir  Peter  TalkThey'd say it was all my own fault an old doating batchelor to marry a young giddy girl They'd paragraph me in the newspapers and make ballads on me  Joseph  And yet Sir Peter I can't think that my Lady Teazle's honour  Sir  Peter  Ah my good friend what's her honour opposed against the flattery of a handsome young fellowBut Joseph she has been upbraiding me of late that I have not made her a settlement and I think in our last quarrel she told me she should not be very sorry if I was dead Now I have drafts of two deeds for your perusal and she shall find if I was to die that I have not been inattentive to her welfare while living By the one she will enjoy eight hundred pounds a year during my life and by the other the bulk of my fortune after my death  Joseph  This conduct is truly generousI wish it mayn't corrupt my pupil  Aside  Sir  Peter  But I would not have her as yet acquainted with the least mark of my affection  Joseph  Nor Iif you could help it  Sir  Peter  And now I have unburthened myself to you let us talk over your affair with Maria  Joseph  Not a syllable upon the subject now    alarmed    Some other time I am too much affected by your affairs to think of my own For the man who can think of his own happiness while his friend is in distress deserves to be hunted as a monster to society  Sir  Peter  I am sure of your affection for her  Joseph  Let me intreat you Sir Peter  Sir  Peter  And though you are so averse to Lady Teazle's knowing it I assure you she is not your enemy and I am sensibly chagrined you have made no furthur progress  Joseph  Sir Peter I must not hear youThe man who    enter servant    What do you want sirrah  Servant  Your brother sir is at the door talking to a Gentleman he says he knows you are at home that Sir Peter is with you and he must see you  Joseph  I'm not at home  Sir  Peter  Yes yes you shall be at home  Joseph    after some hesitation    Very well let him come up  Exit servant  Sir  Peter  Now Joseph I'll hide myself and do you tax him about the affair with my Lady Teazle and so draw the secret from him  Joseph  O fie Sir Peterwhat join in a plot to trepan my brother  Sir  Peter  Oh aye to serve your friendbesides if he is innocent as you say he is it will give him an opportunity to clear himself and make me very happy Hark I hear him comingWhere shall I go Behind this screenWhat the devil here has been one listner already for I'll swear I saw a petticoat  Joseph    Affecting to laugh    It's very ridiculous ha ha haa ridiculous affair indeedha ha ha Hark ye Sir Peter    pulling him aside    though I hold a man of intrigue to be a most despicable character yet you know it does not follow that one is to be an absolute Joseph either Hark ye 'tis a little French  milliner who calls upon me sometimes and hearing you were coming and having some character to loose she sliped behind the screen  Sir  Peter  A French milliner    smiling    cunning rogue Josephfly rogueBut zounds she has over heard every thing that has passed about my wife  Joseph  Oh never fearTake my word it will never go farther for her  Sir  Peter  Won't it  Joseph  No depend upon it  Sir  Peter  Well well if it will go no farther butwhere shall I hide myself  Joseph  Here here slip into this closet and you may over hear every word  L  Teazle  Can I steal away  Peeping  Joseph  Hush hush don't stir  Sir  Peter  Joseph tax him home  Peeping  Joseph  In my dear Sir Peter  L  Teazle  Can't you lock the closet door  Joseph  Not a wordYou'll be discovered  Sir  Peter  Joseph don't spare him  Joseph  For Heaven's sake lie closeA pretty situation I am in to part man and wife in this manner  Aside  Sir  Peter  You're sure the little French Milliner won't blab  Enter  CHARLES  Charles  Why how now brother your fellow denied you they said you were not at homeWhat have you had a Jew wench with you  Joseph  Neither brother neither  Charles  But where's Sir Peter I thought he was with you  Joseph  He was brother but hearing you was coming he left the house  Charles  What was the old fellow afraid I wanted to borrow money of him  Joseph  Borrow no brother but I'm sorry to hear you have given that worthy man cause for great uneasiness  Charles  Yes I am told I do that to a great many worthy menBut how do you mean brother  Joseph  Why he thinks you have endavoured to alienate the affections of Lady Teazle  Charles  Who I alienate the affections of Lady TeazleUpon my word he accuses me very unjustly What has the old gentleman found out that he has got a young wife or what is worse has the Lady found out that she has got an old husband  Joseph  For shame brother  Charles  'Tis true I did once suspect her Ladyship had a partiality for me but upon my soul I never gave her the least encouragement for you know my attachment was to Maria  Joseph  This will make Sir Peter extremely happy But if she had a partiality for you sure you would not have been base enough  Charles  Why look ye Joseph I hope I shall never deliberately do a dishonourable action but if a pretty woman should purposely throw herself in my way and as that pretty woman should happen to be married to a man old enough to be her father  Joseph  What then  Charles  Why then I believe I shouldhave occasion to borrow a little of your morality brother  Joseph  Oh fie brotherThe man who can jest  Charles  Oh that's very true as you were going to observeBut Joseph do you know that I am surprized at your suspecting me with Lady Teazle I thought you was always the favourite there  Joseph  Me  Charles  Why yes I have seen you exchange such significant glances  Joseph  'Pshaw  Charles  Yes I have and don't you remember when I came in here and caught her and you at  Joseph  I must stop him    Aside    Stops his mouth    Sir Peter has overheard every word that you have said  Charles  Sir Peter where is heWhat in the closet'Foregad I'll have him out  Joseph  No no    Stopping him    Charles  I

but you must not be angry at Joseph it was all my plot and I shall think of you as long I live for what I overheard  Charles  Then 'tis well you did not hear more Is it not Joseph  Sir  Peter  What you would have retorted on Joseph would you  Charles  And yet you might as well have suspected him as me Might not he Joseph  Enter  SERVANT  Servant    Whispering Joseph    Lady Sneerwell sir is just coming up and says she must see you  Joseph  Gentlemen I must beg your pardon I have company waiting for me give me leave to conduct you down stairs  Charles  No no speak to 'em in another room I have not seen Sir Peter a great while and I want to talk with him  Joseph  Well I'll send away the person and return immediately Sir Peter not a word of the little French Milliner  Exit  Sir  Peter  Ah Charles what a pity it is you don't associate more with your brother we might then have some hopes of your reformation he's a young man of such sentimentsAh there's nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment  Charles  Oh he's too moral by half and so apprehensive of his good name that I dare say he would as soon let a priest into his house as a wench  Sir  Peter  No no you accuse him wrongfully Though Joseph is not a rake he is no saint  Charles  Oh a perfect anchoritea young hermit  Sir  Peter  Hush hush don't abuse him or he may chance to hear of it again  Charles  Why you won't tell him will you  Sir  Peter  No no butI have a great mind to tell him    Aside      seems to hesitate    Hark'ye Charles have you a mind for a laugh at Joseph  Charles  I should like it of all thingslet's have it  Sir  Peter  Gad I'll tell himI'll be even with Joseph for discovering me in the closet    Aside    Hark'ye Charles he had a girl with him when I called  Charles  Who Joseph impossible  Sir  Peter  Yes a little French Milliner    takes him to the front    and the best of the joke is she is now in the room  Charles  The devil she isWhere  Sir  Peter  Hush hushbehind the screen  Charles  I'll have her out  Sir  Peter  No no no no  Charles  Yes  Sir Peter  No  Charles  By the Lord I willSo now for't  Both run up to the screenscreen falls at the same time  JOSEPH  enters  Charles  Lady Teazle by all that's wonderful  Sir  Peter  Lady Teazle by all that's horrible  Charles  Sir Peter this is the smartest French milliner I ever saw But pray what's the meaning of

Teazle    Advancing    For not one syllable Sir Peter  Sir  Peter  What the devil don't you think it worth your while to agree in the lie  L  Teazle  There's not one word of truth in what that Gentleman has been saying  Joseph  Zounds madam you won't ruin me  L  Teazle  Stand out of the way Mr Hypocrite I'll speak for myself  Sir  Peter  Aye ayelet her aloneshe'll make a better story of it than you did  L  Teazle  I came here with no intention of listening to his addresses to Maria and even ignorant of his pretensions but seduced by his insidious arts at least to listen to his addresses if not to sacrifice his honour as well as my own to his unwarrantable desires  Sir  Peter  Now I believe the truth is coming indeed  Joseph  What is the woman mad  L  Teazle  No sir she has recovered her senses Sir Peter I cannot expect you will credit me but the tenderness you expressed for me when I am certain you did not know I was within hearing has penetrated so deep into my soul that could I have escaped the mortification of this discovery my future life should have convinced you of my sincere repentance As for that smooth tongued hypocrite who  would have seduced the wife of his too credulous friend while he pretended an honourable passion for his ward I now view him in so despicable a light that I shall never again respect myself for having listened to his addresses  Exit  Joseph  Sir PeterNotwithstanding all this Heaven is my witness  Sir  Peter  That you are a villainand so I'll leave you to your meditations  Joseph  Nay Sir Peter you must not leave me The man who

a man of a most benevolent way of thinking  Rowley  Yes he has as much speculative benevolence as any man in the kingdom though he is not so sensual as to indulge himself in the exercise of it  Sir  Oliver  Yet he has a string of sentiments I suppose at his finger's ends  Rowley  And his favourite one is  that charity begins at home  Sir  Oliver  And his I presume is of that domestic sort which

pardon for keeping you a momentMr Stanley I presume  Sir  Oliver  At your service sir  Joseph  Pray be seated Mr Stanley I intreat you sir  Sir  Oliver  Dear sir there's no occasion Too ceremonious by half  Aside  Joseph  Though I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance I am very glad to see you look so well I think Mr Stanley you was nearly related to my mother  Sir  Oliver  I was sir so nearly that my present poverty I fear may do discredit to her wealthy children else I would not presume to trouble you now  Joseph  Ah sir don't mention thatFor the man who is in distress has ever a right to claim kindred with the wealthy I am sure I wish I was of that number or that it was in my power to afford you even a small relief  Sir  Oliver  If your uncle Sir Oliver was here I should have a friend  Joseph  I wish he was you should not want an advocate with him believe me  Sir  Oliver  I should not need one my distresses would recommend me But I imagined his bounty had enabled you to be the agent of his charities  Joseph  Ah sir you are mistaken avarice avarice Mr Stanley is the vice of age to be sure it has been spread abroad that he has been very bountiful to me but without the least foundation though I never chose to contradict the report  Sir  Oliver  And has he never remitted you bullion rupees or pagodas  Joseph  Oh dear sir no such thing I have indeed received some trifling presents from him such as shawls avadavats and Indian crackers nothing more sir  Sir  Oliver  There's gratitude for twelve thousand  pounds    Aside    Shawls avadavats and Indian crackers  Joseph  Then there's my brother Mr Stanley one would scarce believe what I have done for that unfortunate young man  Sir  Oliver  Not I for one    Aside    Joseph  Oh the sums I have lent himWell 'twas an amiable weaknessI must own I can't defend it though it appears more blameable at present as it prevents me from serving you Mr Stanley as my heart directs  Sir  Oliver  Dissembler    Aside    then you cannot assist me  Joseph  I am very unhappy to say it's not in my power at present but you may depend upon hearing from me when I can be of any service to you  Sir  Oliver  Sweet sir you are too good  Joseph  Not at all sir to pity without the power to relieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied Indeed Mr Stanley you have me deeply affected Sir your most devoted I wish you health and spirits  Sir  Oliver  Your ever grateful and perpetual    bowing low    humble servant  Joseph  I am extremely sorry sir for your misfortunes Here open the doorMr Stanley your most devoted  Sir  Oliver  Your most obliged servant Charles you are my heir  Aside and exit  Joseph  This is another of the evils that attend a man's having so good a characterIt subjects him to the importunity of the necessitousthe pure and sterling are of charity is a very expensive article in the  catalogue of a man's virtues whereas the sentimental French plate I use answers the purpose full as well and pays no tax    Going    Enter  ROWLEY  Rowley  Mr Surface your most obedient I wait on you from your uncle who is just arrived    Gives him a note    Joseph  How Sir Oliver arrivedHere Mr call back Mr Stanley  Rowley  It's too late sir I met him going out of the house  Joseph  Was ever any thing so unfortunate    Aside    I hope my uncle has enjoyed good health and spirits  Rowley  Oh very good sir he bid

Charles was the lover and Mr Surface to do him justice was the cause of the discovery he brought Sir Peter and  Sir  Benjamin  Oh my dear madam no such thing for I had it from one  Mrs  Candour  Yes and I had it from one that had it from one that knew  Sir  Benjamin  And I had it from one  Mrs  Candour  No such thingBut here comes my Lady Sneerwell and perhaps she may have heard the particulars  Enter Lady  SNEERWELL  L  Sneerwell  Oh dear Mrs Candour here is a sad affair about our friend Lady Teazle  Mrs  Candour  Why to be sure poor thing I am much concerned for her  L  Sneerwell  I protest

particulars    To Lady Sneerwell    Sir  Benjamin  Yet who could have suspected Mr Surface  Mrs  Candour  Charles you mean  Sir  Benjamin  No Mr Surface  Mrs  Candour  Oh 'twas Charles  L  Sneerwell

to his house and finding Lady Teazle there sir says Sir Peter you are a very ungrateful fellow  Mrs  Candour  Aye that was Charles  Sir  Benjamin  Mr SurfaceAnd old as I am says he I demand immediate satisfaction upon this they both drew their swords and to it they sell  Mrs  Candour  That must be Charles for it is very unlikely that Mr Surface should fight him in his own house  Sir  Benjamin  'Sdeath madam not at all Lady Teazle upon seeing Sir Peter in such danger ran out of the room in strong hysteries and was followed by Charles calling out for hartshorn and water They fought and Sir Peter received a wound in his right side by the thrust of a small sword  Enter  CRABTREE  Crabtree  Pistols Pistols Nephew  Mrs  Candour  Oh Mr Crabtree I am glad you are come now we shall have the whole affair  Sir  Benjamin  No no it was a small sword uncle  Crabtree  Zounds nephew I say it was a pistol  Sir  Benjamin  A thrust in second through the small guts  Crabtree  A bullet lodged in the thorax  Sir  Benjamin  But give me leave dear uncle it was a small sword  Crabtree  I tell you it was a pistolWon't you suffer any body to know any thing but yourself It was a pistol and Charles  Mrs  Candour  Aye I knew it was Charles  Sir  Benjamin  Mr Surface uncle  Crabtree  Why zounds I say it was Charles must no body speak but yourself I'll tell you how the whole affair was  L  Sneerwell  Mrs  Candour  Ah do do pray tell us  Sir Benjamin  I see my uncle knows nothing at all about the matter  Crabtree  Mr Surface you must know Ladies came late from Salthill where he had been the evening before with a particular friend of his who has a son at Eton his pistols were left on the bureau  and unfortunately loaded and on Sir Peter's taxing Charles  Sir  Benjamin  Mr Surface you mean  Crabtree  Do pray nephew hold your tongue and let me speak sometimesI say Ladies upon his taking Charles to account and taxing him with the basest ingratitude  Sir  Benjamin  Aye Ladies I told you Sir Peter taxed him with ingratitude  Crabtree  They agreed each to take a pistol They fired at the same instantCharles's ball took place and lodged in the thorax Sir Peter's missed and what is very extraordinary the ball grazed against a little bronze Shakespeare that stood over the chimney flew off through the window at right angles and wounded the post man who was just come to the door with a double letter from Northamptonshire  Sir  Benjamin  I heard nothing of all this I must own Ladies my uncle's account is more circumstantial though mine is the true one  L  Sneerwell  I am more interested in this affair than they imagine and must have better information  Aside and exit  Sir  Benjamin  Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for  Crabtree  Why yes they do saybut that's neither here nor there  Mrs  Candour  But pray where is Sir Peter now I hope his wound won't prove mortal  Crabtree  He was carried home immediately and has given positive orders to be denied to every body  Sir  Benjamin  And I believe Lady Teazle is attending him  Mrs  Candour  I do believe so too  Crabtree  CertainlyI met one of the faculty as I came in  Sir  Benjamin  Gad so and here he comes  Crabtree  Yes yes that's the Doctor  Mrs  Candour  That certainly must be the physician Now we shall get information  Enter Sir  OLIVER SURFACE  Dear Doctor how is your patient  Sir  Benjamin  I hope his wounds are not mortal  Crabtree  Is he in a fair way of recovery  Sir  Benjamin  Pray Doctor was he not wounded by a thrust of a sword through the small guts  Crabtree  Was it not by a bullet that lodged in the thorax  Sir  Benjamin  Nay pray answer me  Crabtree  Dear dear Doctor speak  All pulling him  Sir  Oliver  Hey hey good people are you all madWhy what the devil is the mattera sword through the small guts and a bullet lodged in the thorax What would you all be at  Sir  Benjamin  Then perhaps sir you are not a Doctor  Sir  Oliver  If I am sir I am to thank you for my degree  Crabtree  Only a particular friend I suppose  Sir  Oliver  Nothing more sir  Sir  Benjamin  Then I suppose as you are a friend you can be better able to give us some account of his wounds  Sir  Oliver  Wounds  Mrs  Candour  What havn't you heard he was woundedThe saddest accident  Sir  Benjamin  A thrust with a sword through the small guts  Crabtree  A bullet in the thorax  Sir  Oliver  Good people speak one at a time I beseech youYou both agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded  Crabtree  Sir  Benjamin  Ay ay we both agree in that  Sir  Oliver  Then I will be bold to say Sir Peter is one of the most imprudent men in the world for here he comes walking as if nothing had happened  Enter Sir  PETER  My good friend you are certainly mad to walk about in this condition you should go to bed you that have had a sword through your small guts and a bullet lodged in your thorax  Sir  Peter  A sword through my small guts and a bullet lodged in my thorax  Sir  Oliver  Yes these worthy people would have killed you without law or physic and wanted to dub me a Doctor in order to make me an accomplice  Sir  Peter  What is all this  Sir  Benjamin  Sir Peter we are all very glad to find the story of the duel is not true  Crabtree  And exceedingly sorry for your other misfortunes  Sir  Peter  So so all over the town already  Aside  Mrs  Candour  Though as Sir Peter was so good a husband I pity him sincerely  Sir  Peter  Plague of your pity  Crabtree  As you continued so long a batchelor you was certainly to blame to marry at all  Sir  Peter  Sir I desire you'll consider this is my own house  Sir  Benjamin  However you must not be offended at the jests you'll meet on this occasion  Crabtree  It is no uncommon case that's one thing  Sir  Peter  I insist upon being master here in plain terms I desire you'll leave my house immediately  Mrs  Candour  Well well sir we are going and you may depend upon it we shall make the best of the story  Exit  Sir  Benjamin  And tell how badly you have been treated  Sir  Peter  Leave my house directly  Exit Sir  Benjamin  Crabtree  And how patiently you bare it    Exit  Crabtree  Sir  Peter  Leave my house I sayFiends furies there is no bearing it  Enter  ROWLEY  Sir  Oliver  Well Sir Peter I have seen my Nephews  Rowley  And Sir Oliver is convinced your judgment is right after all  Sir  Oliver  Aye Joseph is the man  Rowley  Such sentiments  Sir  Oliver  And acts up to the sentiments he professes  Rowley  Oh 'tis edification to hear him talk  Sir  Oliver  He is a pattern for the young men of the ageBut how comes it Sir Peter that you don't join in his praises  Sir  Peter  Sir Oliver we live in a damned wicked world and the fewer we praise the better  Sir Oliver  Right right my old friendBut was you always so moderate in your judgement  Rowley  Do you say so Sir Peter You never was mistaken in your life  Sir  Peter  Oh plague of your jokesI suppose you are acquainted with the whole affair  Rowley  I am indeed sirI met Lady Teazle returning from Mr Surface's so humbled that she deigned to beg even me to become here advocate  Sir  Peter  What does Sir Oliver know it too  Sir  Oliver  Aye aye every circumstance  Sir  Peter  What about the closet and the screen  Sir  Oliver  Yes and the little French milliner too I never laughed more in my life  Sir  Peter  And a very pleasant jest it was  Sir  Oliver  This is your man of sentiment Sir Peter  Sir  Peter  Oh damn his sentiments  Sir  Oliver  You must have made a pretty appearance when Charles dragged you out of the closet  Sir  Peter  Yes yes that was very diverting  Sir  Oliver  And egad Sir Peter I should like to have seen your face when the screen was thrown down  Sir  Peter  My face when the screen was thrown down oh yesThere's no bearing this    Aside    Sir  Oliver  come come my old friend don't be vexed for I can't help laughing for the soul of me Ha ha ha  Sir  Peter  Oh laugh onI am not vexedno no it is the pleasantest thing in the world To be the standing jest of all one's acquaintance 'tis the happiest situation imaginable  Rowley  See sir yonder's my Lady Teazle coming this way and in tears let me beg of you to be reconciled  Sir  Oliver  Well well I'll leave Rowley to mediate between you and take my leave but you must make haste after me to Mr Surface's where I go if not to reclaim a libertine at least to expose hypocrisy  Exit  Sir  Peter  I'll be with you at the discovery I should like to see it though it is a vile unlucky place for discoveries Rowley    looking out    she is not coming this way  Rowley  No sir but she has left the room door open and writs your coming  Sir  Peter  Well certainly mortification is very becoming in a wifeDon't you think I had better let her pine a little longer  Rowley  Oh sir that's being too severe  Sir  Peter  I don't think so the letter I found from Charles was evidently intended for her  Rowley  Indeed Sir Peter you are much mistaken  Sir  Peter  If I was convinced of thatsee Master Rowley she looks this wayWhat a remarkable elegant turn of the head she hasI have a good mind to go to her  Rowley  Do dear sir  Sir  Peter  But when it is known that we are reconciled▪ I shall be laughed at more than ever  Rowley  Let them laugh on and retort their malice upon themselves by shewing them you can be happy in spite of their slander  Sir  Peter  Faith and so I will Master Rowley and my Lady Teazle and I may still be the happiest couple in the country  Rowley  Oh fie Sir Peter he that lays aside suspicion  Sir  Peter  My dear Rowley if you have any regard for me never let me hear you utter any thing like a sentiment again I have had enough of that to last me the remainder of my life  Exeunt  SCENE JOSEPH'S Library  Enter  JOSEPH  and Lady  SNEERWELL  L  Sneerwell  Impossible Will not Sir Peter be immediately reconciled to Charles and no longer oppose his union with Maria  Joseph  Can passion mend it  L  Sneerwell  No nor cunning neither I was a fool to league with such a blunderer  Joseph  Sure my Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest sufferer in this affair and yet you see I bear it with calmness  L  Sneerwell  Because the disappointment does not reach your heart your interest only was concerned Had you felt for Maria what I do for that unfortunate libertine your brother you would not be dissuaded from taking every revenge in your power  Joseph  Why will you rail at me for the disappointment  L  Sneerwell  Are you not the cause Had you not a sufficient field for your roguery in imposing upon Sir Peter and supplanting your brother but you must endeavour to seduce his wife I hate such an avarice of crimes 'tis an unfair monopoly and never prospers  Joseph  Well I own I am to blameI have deviated from the direct rule of wrong Yet I cannot think circumstances are so bad as your Ladyship apprehends  L  Sneerwell  No  Joseph  You tell me you have made another trial  of Snake that he still proves steady to our interest and that he is ready if occasion requires to swear to a contract having passed between Charles and your Ladyship  L  Sneerwell  And what then  Joseph  Why the letters which have been so carefully circulated will corroborate his evidence and prove the truth of the assertion But I expect my uncle every moment and must beg your Ladyship to retire into the next room  L  Sneerwell  But if he should find you out  Joseph  I have no fear of thatSir Peter won't tell for his own sake and I shall soon find out Sir Oliver's weak side  L  Sneerwell  Nay I have no doubt of your abilities▪ only be constant to one villainy at a time  Joseph  Well I will I will    Exit Lady Sneerwell    It is confounded hard though to be baited by one's confederate in wickedness    knocking  Who have we got here My uncle Oliver I supposeOh old Stanley again How came he here He must not stay  Enter Sir  OLIVER  I told you already Mr Stanley that it was not in my power to relieve you  Sir  Oliver  But I hear sir that Sir Oliver is arrived and perhaps he might  Joseph  Well sir you cannot stay now sir but any other time sir you shall certainly be relieved  Sir  Oliver  h Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted  Joseph  I  upon your going Indeed Mr  you can't stay  Sir  Olive    Positively I must see Sir Oliver  Joseph  Then positively you shan't stay  Pushing him out  Enter  CHARLES  Charles  Hey day what's the matter Why who the devil have we got here What my little Premium Oh brother you must not hurt my little broker But hark'ye Joseph what have you been borrowing money too  Joseph  Borrowing money no brotherWe expect my uncle Oliver here every minute and Mr Stanley insists upon seeing him  Charles  Stanley Why his name is Premium  Joseph  No no I tell you his name is Stanley  Charles  But I tell you again his name is Premium  Joseph  It don't signify what his name is  Charles  No more it don't as you say brother for I suppose he goes by half a hundred names besides A B at the Coffeehouses But old Noll must not come and catch my little broker here neither  Joseph  Mr Stanley I beg  Charles  And I beg Mr Premium  Joseph  You must go indeed Mr Stanley  Charles  Aye you must go Mr Premium  Both pushing him  Enter Sir  PETER  Lady  TEAZLE MARIA  and  ROWLEY  Sir  Peter  What my old friend Sir Oliver what's the matterIn the name of wonder were there ever two such ungracious nephews to assault their uncle at his first visit  L  Teazle  On my word sir it was well we came to your rescue  Joseph  Charles  Charles  Joseph  Joseph  Now our ruin is complete  Charles  Very  Sir  Peter  You find Sir Oliver your necessitous character of old Stanley could not protect you  Sir  Oliver  No nor Premium neither The necessities of the former could not extract a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman there and with the other I stood a worse chance than my ancestors and had like to have been knocked down without being bid for Sir Peter my friend and Rowley look upon that elder Nephew of mine▪ you both know what I have done for him and how gladly I would have looked upon half my fortune as held only in trust for him Judge then of my surprise and disappointment at finding him destitute of truth charity and gratitude  Sir  Peter  Sir Oliver I should be as much surprised as you if I did not already know him to be artful selfish and hypocritical  L  Teazle  And if he pleads not guilty to all this let him call upon me to finish his character  Sir  Peter  Then I believe we need not add more for if he knows himself it will be a sufficient punishment for him that he is known by the world  Charles▪  If they talk this way to honesty what will they say to me by and by  Aside  Sir  Oliver  As for that profligate there  pointing to Charles  Charles  Ay now comes my turn the damn'd family pictures will ruin me  Aside  Joseph  Sir Oliver will you honour me with a hearing  Charles  Now if Joseph would make one of his  long speeches I should have time to recollect myself  Aside  Sir  Peter  I suppose you would undertake to justify yourself entirely  Joseph  I trust I could Sir  Sir  Oliver  'Pshaw    turns away from him    and I suppose you could justify yourself too  To Charles  Charles  Not that I know of sir  Sir  Oliver  What my little Premium was let too much into the secret  Charles  Why yes sir but they were family secrets and should go no further  Rowley  Come come sir Oliver I am sure you cannot look upon Charles's follies with anger  Sir  Oliver  No nor with gravity neitherDo you know sir Peter the young rogue has been selling me his ancestors I have bought judges and staff officers by the foot and maiden aunts as cheap as old china    During this speech Charles laughs behind his hat    Charles  Why that I have made free with the family canvas is true my ancestors may rise in judgment against me there's no denying it but believe me when I tell you and upon my soul I would not say it if it was not so if I don't appear mortified at the exposure of my follies it is because I feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction at seeing you my liberal benefactor    embraces him    Sir  Oliver  Charles I forgive you give me your hand again the little illlooking fellow over the settee has made your peace for you  Charles  Then sir my gratitude to the original is still increased  L  Teazle  Sir Oliver here is another with whom I dare say Charles is no less anxious to be reconciled  Sir  Oliver  I have heard of that attachment before and with the Lady's leaveif I construe right that blush  Sir  Peter  Well child speak for yourself  Maria  I have little more to say than that I wish him happy and for any influence I might once have had over his affections I most willingly resign them to one who has a better claim to them  Sir  Peter  Hey what's the matter now While he was a rake and a profligate you would hear of nobody else and now that he is likely to reform you won't have him What's the meaning of all this  Maria  His own heart and Lady Sneerwell can best inform you  Charles  Lady Sneerwell  Joseph  I am very sorry brother I am obliged to speak to this point but justice demands it from me and Lady Sneerwell's wrongs can no longer be concealed  Enter Lady  SNEERWELL  Sir  Peter  Another French millinerI believe he has one in every room in the house  L  Sneerwell  Ungrateful Charles Well you may seem confounded and surprized at the indelicate situation to which your perfidy has reduced me  Charles  Pray uncle is this another of your plots for as I live this is the first I ever heard of it  Joseph  There is but one witness I believe necessary to the business  Sir Peter  And that witness is Mr Snakeyou were perfectly in the right in bringing him with you    Rowley  Desire Mr Snake to walk inIt is rather unlucky madam that he should be brought to confront and not support your Ladyship  Enter  SNAKE  L  Sneerwell  I am surprized what speak villain have you too conspired against me  Snake  I beg your Ladyship ten thousand pardons I must own you paid me very liberally for the lying questions but I have unfortunately been offered double for speaking the truth  Sir  Peter  Plot and counterplotI give your Ladyship much joy of your negociation  L  Sneerwell  May the torments of despair and disappointment light upon you all    going    L  Teazle  Hold Lady Sneerwell before you go give me leave to return you thanks  or the trouble you and this gentleman took in writing letters in my name to Charles and answering them yourself and at the same time I must beg you will present my compliments to the scandalous college of which you are president and inform them that Lady Teazle licentiate returns the diploma they granted her as she leaves off practice and kills characters no longer  L  Sneerwell  You too madam Provoking insolent may your husband live these fifty years  Exit  L  Teazle  Oh Lordwhat a malicious creature it is  Sir  Peter  Not for her last wish I hope  L  Teazle  Oh no no no  Sir  Peter  Well sirwhat have you to say for yourself    to Joseph    Joseph  Sir I am so confounded that Lady Sneerwell should impose upon us all by suborning Mr  Snake that I know not what to saybutlest her malice should prompt her to injure my brother I had better follow her  Exit  Sir  Peter  Moral to the last  Sir  Oliver  Marry her Joseph marry her if you canOil and Vinegaryou'll do very well together  Rowley  Mr Snake I believe we have no further occasion for you  Sir  Peter  Wellaverse to sentiments as I am yet I cannot help observing that when a knave succeeds in his designs upon credulity he can boast of nothing more than having been a while mistaken for an honest man but it would be better for the continuance and completion of his happiness were he to become for life and in reality what he has only seemed to be  FINIS
