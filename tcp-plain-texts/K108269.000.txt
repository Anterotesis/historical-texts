 THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION  THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION OR A SERIOUS WARNING TO GREAT BRITAIN AND HER COLONIES Founded on unquestionable EXAMPLES of GOD's TEMPORAL VENGEANCE AGAINST Tyrants Slaveholders and Oppressors  The Examples are selected from  Predictions  in the Old Testament of NATIONAL JUDGEMENTS which being compared with their actual Accomplishment demonstrate  "the sure Word of Prophecy"  as well as the  immediate Interposition of  DIVINE PROVIDENCE  to recompence impenitent  NATIONS  according to their Works  By GRANVILLE SHARP  The People of the Land have used  Oppression  and exercised  Robbery  and have  vexed the Poor and Needy  yea they have OPPRESS∣ED THE STRANGER WRONGFULLY  c  There∣fore have I poured out mine Indignation upon them  c  Their OWN WAY  have I recompensed upon their Heads  saith the Lord God  Ezek xxii  LONDON Printed by W RICHARDSON For B WHITE at Horace's Head in Fleet Street and E and C DILLY in the Poultry  MDCCLXXVI  If thou seest the Oppression of the Poor and violent perverting of Judgement and Justice in a Province marvel not at the matter  or will  FOR HE THAT IS HIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST REGARDETH  c Eccles v  The  Lord SAW it and it dis∣pleased him that there was NO JUDGEMENT and he SAW that  there was  NO MAN and wondered that  there was  NO INTERCESSOR  c  And he put on the Garments of VENGEANCE for cloth∣ing and was clad with zeal as a cloke ACCORD∣ING TO THEIR DEEDS ACCORDINGLY HE WILL REPAY fury to his Adversaries RECOMPENCE or  Retribution  TO HIS ENEMIES TO THE ISLAND'S HE WILL REPAY RECOMPENCE  c Isa lix  How long will ye judge unjustly and accept the Persons of the Wicked Defend the Poor and Fatherless do Justice to the Afflicted and Needy DELIVER THE POOR AND NEEDY RID THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE WICKED  Ps lxxxii  Remove Violence and Spoil and execute Judgement and Justice TAKE AWAY YOUR EX∣ACTIONS FROM MY PEOPLE SAITH THE LORD GOD  Ezek xlv  THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION  THE AFRICAN SLAVETRADE has been publicly supported and encouraged by  the Legislature of this King∣dom  for near a century last past so that the  monstrous destruction of the Human Species  which is  annually  occasioned thereby may certainly be esteemed a  National Crime  of the most aggravating kind which according to the usual course of God's Providence in the World will probably draw down some exemplary vengeance upon the unre∣penting Inhabitants of this Island And with respect to the  British Colonies  the  uncharitable practice of  Slaveholding  especially in the WestIndia Islands and the more Southern Colonies is grown up into a more enormous and destructive  Oppression  whether we view the prodi∣gious multitudes of the  Oppressed  or the unconscionable severity of the  Oppressors  than perhaps ever disgraced any other Nation at any one period of time  The several attempts that have lately been made to justify these two branches of abominable National Iniquity by the Holy Scriptures and especially by the permission therein granted to  the Israelites  to  purchase  and  retain Slaves  among them have induced me to collect from the History of  the Jews  in the several Books of Holy Scripture some plain examples of God's Vengeance upon that particular Nation expressly for this kind of  Op∣pression  which I hope will sufficiently prove that  Slavery  was ever detestable in  the sight of God and consequently that a speedy Reformation is absolutely ne∣cessary as well with respect to the  African Slavetrade  encouraged in this Kingdom as the  Toleration of Slavery  in the British American Dominions if we mean to entertain the least hope of escaping a severe  National Retribution  which if we may judge by our present Civil Dissentions and horrid  mutual  Slaughters of  National Brethren  seem ready to burst upon us  I am well aware indeed how very unfashionable it is nowadays to quote  Scripture  when matters of  Law Politics  or  Trade  are called in question yet I flat∣ter myself that the following examples drawn from thence are perfectly suitable to my present point and consequently must have weight to convince all persons who sincerely acknowledge the  Truth of the Scriptures  that we have the greatest  reason to apprehend the infliction of some heavy Judgement from Almighty God upon these Kingdoms on account of the monstrous load of Guilt which the British Subjects  on each side of the Atlan∣tic  have incurred by the  Oppressions  abovementioned  In some former Tracts I have already shewn that the Servitude which the Jews by the Mosaic Law were permitted to exact of  their Brethren  even when the latter were  sold  to them was very much  limited  that they were not to be treated as  Bond Servants  If thy  Brother  that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be  sold unto thee  thou shalt not compel him to serve as  a Bond Servant  but as an Hired Servant and as a Sojourner he shall be with thee  c  Levit xxv  but as  Hired Ser∣vants  that the  Servitude  could not law∣fully be extended beyond  seven years  If thou buy an Hebrew Servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing  Exod xxi  unless the Servant loved  his Master  and Condition and voluntarily demanded  And if the Servant shall  plainly  say  I love  my Master my Wife and my Children  I will not go out free  c  Exod xxi Thus it is evident that the Jews could not acquire  any right  to the perpe∣tual Service of their  Brethren  John or Thomas except by virtue of  a voluntary Contract  which is something similar to that Clause in the Habeas Corpus Act con∣cerning a Contract which I thought myself obliged to acknowledge in my former Tract as an exception to the idea of Universal  Freedom  in this Kingdom But in neither case can the  Contract  for Service be  im∣plied  for in the latter the Contract must be  in writing  and the signing be clearly proved to be  a voluntary act  without the least suspicion of  Duress  and in the for∣mer case it was necessary that the Servant should ac∣knowledge in  a Court of Record  that he was  willing  to enter into such a Contract for the Hebrew  Servant  could not be made a  Slave  unless he would  plainly say  I love my Master  c  I WILL NOT GO OUT FREE Then  says the Text  his Master shall bring him  unto the  JUDGES  which an∣swers to the public  Acknowledgement  necessary in the other case to be made in  a Court of Record  for with∣out this the Hebrew Master had no authority to bore the Servant's Ear in token of Bondage Exod xxi  of him to continued in his Service and that in every other case it was  absolutely unlawful to hold a Brother Hebrew in Slavery  I have likewise shewn that under the glorious Dispensation of the Gospel we are absolutely bound to consider our∣selves as  Citizens of the World  that every Man whatever without any  partial dis∣tinction  of Nation Distance or Com∣plexion must necessarily be esteemed  our Neighbour  and  our Brother  and that we are absolutely bound in Christian Duty to entertain  a Disposition  towards  all Mankind  as charitable and benevo∣lent  at least  as that which was required of the Jews under the Law towards their  national Brethren  and conse∣quently that it is absolutely unlawful for those  who call themselves Christians  to exact of  their Brethren  I mean  their Brethren of the Universe  a more burthen∣some Service than that to which the Jews were limited with respect to their  Brethren  of the House of Israel and the Slavery or involuntary Bondage of  a Brother Israelite  was absolutely forbid  These premises naturally lead us to consider the severe NATIONAL JUDGE∣MENTS which the Jews brought upon themselves principally  by exceeding these very limitations  which I have here speci∣fied and the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from these examples is that we are  absolutely  in danger of THE LIKE JUDGEMENTS if we do not immediately put a stop to all  similar Oppression  by  Na∣tional Authority  because an uncharitable extension of the  said limits  by those who call themselves Christians will certainly be at least  as heinous in the sight of God  as the OPPRESSION OF BRETHREN under the Law and probably much more so if we consider the purity and benevo∣lence which is required of all Men under the Gospel Dispensation and I have  clearly proved I trust that the permis∣sion to the Israelites to keep  Bondmen of the Heathen  or more properly the  Na∣tions  that were round about them  and of  the Children of  the Strangers  that dwelt among them  cannot be extended to  any other People  whatever except  the Israelites  themselves and that even to them it was only  temporary  during the Dispensation of the Mosaic Law whilst they possessed the Land of Canaan the former Inhabitants of which  viz  the seven abominable  Nations  of Palestine expressly mentioned by name in the seventh Chapter of Deuteronomy where the same Heb Noun  ren∣dered  Heathen  in the former Text is properly expressed by the English word  Nations  the Israelites were expressly directed to drive out kill and destroy  without pity  "Thine eye shall have  no pity  upon them" Deut vii  and to make  no Covenant  with them  Thou shalt make  no Covenant  with them nor  shew Mercy  unto them  c  Deut vii  and I hope I have also proved that  the remainder  of these parti∣cular wicked Nations thus expressly doomed to destruction were undoubtedly "the  Heathen  " or  Nations    that dwelt round about  the Israelites and  the Children of the Strangers  whom and  whom alone  it was lawful to hold  in perpetual Bondage  for otherwise that permission cannot be reconciled to God's positive Commands given in the same Law to  love  the  Stranger  The Lord your God is God of Gods and Lord of Lords a great God a mighty and a terrible  which regardeth not Persons  so that this was apparently a general Law or Rule of Conduct towards  all Persons  except the People of those  parti∣cular Nations  which were expressly  by name  condemned to destruction by the hands of the Israelites in other parts of  the Law for their abominable wicked∣ness  nor taketh Reward he doth ex∣ecute the Judgement of the Father∣less and Widow and  loveth the Stran∣ger  in giving him food and raiment LOVE YE THEREFORE  the Stranger  and the Almighty incul∣cates a sympathetic concern for the wel∣fare and happiness of  Strangers  by re∣minding the Israelites of their own un∣happy situation formerly in a  strange  country "for ye" says the Text  were  Strangers  in the Land of Egypt  Deut x to See also Levit xix  "Thou shalt love him"  that is  the Stranger    as thyself  for ye were  Strangers  in the Land of Egypt  National  Wickedness from the be∣ginning of the World has generally been visited with  National  Punishments and surely no  National  Wickedness can be more heinous in the sight of God  than a public toleration of  Slavery and Oppression  for Tyranny in whatsoever shape it appears must necessarily be esteemed a presumptuous breach of that Divine Command in which  all Law is fulfilled  Gal v  viz  Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself  Levit xix  The Histories of all Nations indeed afford tremendous examples of  God's Vengeance  against Tyrants but no His∣tory is so proper to illustrate this sub∣ject which now so nearly concerns us as that of the Jews for as the Know∣ledge of the  Divine Law  was revealed in a more particular manner to  that People  and to others  only through them  so the effect even of their Disobedience was an exemplary demonstration from time to time of  God's Vengeance  as well as of  his Mercy  for the instruction of all other Nations amongst whom they  are now dispersed as living monuments of the same to this very day and we have the authority of an Apostle  Cor x  to assert that  all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written  says he  for our ad∣monition upon whom the ends of the world are come  One of the first and most signal in∣stances of Mercy which the Almighty was pleased to shew that People after they  became a Nation  was the restoring them to their  Natural Freedom  from the deplorable  Slavery  in which they were detained by a tyrannical Egyptian Monarch    the Children of Israel sighed by reason of  the Bondage  and  they cried  and their cry came up unto God  by reason of the Bondage  and God  heard their groaning  c  Exod ii  And the Lord said I have  surely seen the Affliction of my People  which are in Egypt and have  heard their cry  by reason of their  Taskmasters  for I know their Sorrows and I am come down  to deli∣ver them  out of the hand of the Egyptians  Exod iii  and the tremendous  Judgements whereby this deliverance was effected  viz  the Plagues of Egypt are so many signal examples of  God's severe Vengeance against Slaveholders  which ought to be had in everlasting remembrance to warn all Nations of the World against the unnatural and baneful practice of  keeping Slaves  This deliverance from  Bondage  was frequently mentioned even in the words of God himself by his Prophets from time to time as I have before remarked "Thus saith the Lord"  i e  Jeho∣vah  God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth  out of the House of Bondage    more  literally  from the House  of Slaves"  and  I delivered you  out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of  all that oppressed you  c  Judges vi  I re∣moved his  Shoulder from the Burden  his  Hands were delivered from the Pats  In like manner there are multitudes of poor people retained in  a deplorable Bondage  even to this day in  the Potteries  of China  thou calledst in trouble and I delivered thee  Psal lxxxi  The Israelites themselves were also particularly directed  to remember  this signal exertion of Divine Mercy and Power in the cause of  Popular Freedom "Remember  that thou wast  a Servant" viz a Slave  in the Land of Egypt and that the Lord thy God  brought thee out  thence  through a mighty hand  and by a stretchedout arm  c  Deut v  It was surely for the moral purpose of stirring up in the Israelites a sympa∣thetic concern for the Sufferings of the  Oppressed  and more particularly of  Op∣pressed Strangers  that they were so fre∣quently reminded of their own former deplorable condition  in Slavery  and of their miraculous  Deliverance  from thence being expressly referred to their  own Feelings  and  Remembrance  of the cruel  foreign  Tyranny which they themselves had so lately experienced in Egypt  thou shalt not oppress  a Stranger  for  ye  KNOW THE HEART    properly THE SOUL  OF A STRANGER seeing ye were  Stran∣gers  in the Land of Egypt  Exod xxiii  God also gave the Israelites due warn∣ing of the Danger of  Oppression  by de∣claring that he would SURELY re∣venge the Cause of the injured  Stranger  Thou shalt neither  vex a Stranger  nor  oppress him  for ye were  Strangers  in the Land of Egypt Ye shall not afflict any Widow or fatherless Child If thou afflict them in any wise and  they cry at all unto me I will SURELY hear their cry  mark this ye African Traders  of this Island  and ye  WestIndia  and  British American  Slaveholders for ye are all guilty of the like abominable  Oppressions  and God will SURELY avenge the Cause of  the Oppressed    and my wrath shall wax hot and I will kill you with the sword and your Wives shall be Widows and your Children fatherless  Exod xxii to  And have not the careless Inhabitants of Great Britain and her Colonies too much reason also to apprehend that  the same God  who  professes  to  hear the cry  of oppressed  Strangers  if they  cry at  all  unto him will sooner or later visit these Kingdoms with some signal mark of his Displeasure for the notorious  Oppression  of an almost innumerable mul∣titude of poor  African Strangers  that are harrassed and continually wearing out with a most shameful involuntary Servitude in the  British Colonies  nay and that by a public Toleration under the sanction of Laws to which the Mo∣narchs of England from time to time by the advice of their Privy Counsellors have given  the Royal Assent  and thereby rendered themselves Parties in  the Op∣pression  and it is to be feared Par∣takers of the Guilt  Let us not forget before it is too late that the Almighty has not only declared himself ready to "HEAR THE CRY"  of the oppressed Stranger  but hath deigned to add to his glorious Name  Jehovah  a brief  Remembrance  of his merciful inter∣position  in behalf of an  enslaved Nation  "I am the Lord your God" or  Jehovah  your God said the Almighty to the Israelites  which  brought thee out of the Land of Egypt out of the House of Bondage  Exod xx Thus the Almighty Deliverer from  Slavery  vouch∣safed to set his own Divine Example before the eyes of his redeemed People to excite Benevolence and Thankful∣ness and the like Remembrance of that glorious Redemption from  Sla∣very  was very frequently repeated from time to time which the Scriptures sufficiently testify but alas the Isra∣elites profited so little by these whole∣some lessons that it became necessary no less frequently to remind them of  the dreadful Vengeance  which would in∣evitably overtake them for their noto∣rious  Oppressions of the Poor  for their unjust Exactions of  involuntary and un∣rewarded Service  and for exceeding the  limitations  of  Bondage  already recited which the Law expressly enjoined  For the  Oppression  of the Poor for the  Sighing  of the Needy now will I  arise  saith the Lord and will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him  or  that would ensnare him  Psal xii  The Princely Prophet Isaiah plainly declared to them that their public Fasts and outward Humiliations were not only vain but even offensive to God while  such notorious Oppressions  continued among them "Behold" said he  in the day of your Fast you find Pleasure and  exact all your Labours  Sunt inter quos Belgae qui hic intelligunt  Opera Servilia  quae a  Servis    Ancillis  hoc ipso di  rigide ex∣igebantur  ut aliis diebus  "  " Omnes Subjectos vobis affligitis  quae lectio says Vitringa absque emendatione facile sub∣sistit And a little afterwards he adds Prior inter∣pretatio  de Operibus Servorum  aut  molestis exactionibus Subditerum  magna se commendat specie estque mihi in eam pronior animus  lviii  And again  Is it such a Fast that I have chosen a day for a Man to af∣flict his Soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush  c  Is not this the Fast that I have chosen to loose  the Bands of Wickedness  to undo  the heavy Burthens  or rather  the Bundles of the Yoke  plainly referring to the severe and  unjust Bondage of the Poor    and TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE and that YE BREAK EVERY YOKE    Is it not to deal thy Bread to the Hungry and to bring the Poor that are  cast out  or rather to bring the Poor that are  reduced  or  depressed viz  as it were by Tyrants for so the word  seems more properly to signify in this place  "to thy House" c  Compare this  with Deut xxiii  Thou shalt not deliver unto his Master the Servant which is escaped from his Master  unto thee he shall  dwell with thee even  among you in that place which he shall choose  in one of thy gates  where it liketh him best thou shalt not  oppress him  Deut xxiii  And he warned them of the Divine Justice that would pursue them for their Oppression and tyrannical Treatment of the Poor  The Lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the People The Lord will enter into Judge∣ment with the Ancients or  Senators  of his People and  the Princes  thereof for ye have eaten up the Vineyard  the Spoil of the Poor is in your Houses  What mean ye that ye  beat my People to pieces  and grind the Faces of the Poor  saith the Lord of Hosts Isa iii to  The wicked practices whereby the Israelites reduced their poor  Brethren  to  Slavery  are described by the Prophet Amos  Hear this O ye that  swallow up the Needy  even to make  the Poor of the Land to fail  saying When will the New Moon be gone that we may sell Corn and the Sabbath that we may set forth Wheat making the Ephah small and the Shekel great and falsifying the Ballances by Deceit That  we may buy the Poor for Silver  Ideo ut ubi solvere non poterunt dent se nobis  in Servitutem  ut mos erat illarum Gentium  Grotius  in locum  and the Needy for a Pair of Shoes  that is comparatively speak∣ing at a most contemptible price whereby we may presume that  Slavemarkets  were not so notoriously estab∣lished at that time as at present and that the  Bidders  were  few  though the  Oppressed  were  many    yea and sell the Refuse of the Wheat The Lord hath sworn by the Excellency of Ja∣cob  surely I will never forget any of these works Shall not the Land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein  c  Amos viii to  Here is a solemn Appeal from God to the  Human Understanding  Shall not the Land tremble  for this  that is for this same  abominable Oppression  of the Poor  the buying them for Slaves  in which Great Britain and her Co∣lonies are infinitely more guilty than the People to whom this appeal was made and  "shall not the Land"  therefore  even our Land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein  c Surely  God will never forget any of these Works  my Countrymen  The Prophet Jeremiah manifestly alluded to the like deceitful practices  of the Jews whereby they reduced the Poor to  Slavery  when he made a so∣lemn protest against them in the Name of God"Your sins" said he  have withholden good things from you For among my People are found wicked men they lay wait as he  that setteth Snares  THEY SET A TRAP THEY CATCH MEN As a Cage or Coup is full of Birds so are their Houses full of Deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich They are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the Wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the Father∣less yet they prosper and the right of the Needy do they not judge Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord Shall not  my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this  c  Jer v to Here again the Al∣mighty plainly appeals to the Human  Understanding concerning the Propri∣ety or rather the Necessity of exert∣ing the Divine Vengeance against such an  Oppressive Nation  And yet how inconsiderable was the crime of the Jewish Nation in this re∣spect if compared with the  numerous Bondage  and with the unbounded Op∣pression of the poor Negroes in the Bri∣tish Colonies Have we not therefore just reason to fear that God will  visit for these things  Does not the Word of God which cannot change appeal to us my Countrymen as well as to the Jews  "Shall not my Soul"  saith the Lord  be avenged on such a Na∣tion as this  The same Prophet in the next chap∣ter declares  the Divine Vengeance  to be at hand  For thus hath the Lord of Hosts saidHew ye down Trees  and cast a Mount  against Jerusalem  This is the City to be visited she is  wholly Oppression  in the midst of her As a Fountain casteth out her Waters so she casteth out her Wick∣edness  Violence and Spoil  is heard in her before me continually is  Grief and Wounds  Be thou instructed O Jerusalem lest my Soul depart from thee lest I make thee desolate a Land not inhabited  Jer vi to  But in vain were the Warnings of the Prophet till  the Judgements  them∣selves began to appear  in all the horrors of a hopeless War  which began in the ninth year  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came he and all his host against Jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about  Kings xxv  In the ninth year of Zedekiah King of Judah in the tenth month came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem and they besieged it  c  Jer xxxix See also chap lii ver  of King Zedekiah's  reign notwithstanding that the Mo∣narch had previously rendered himself secure as he thought by his military preparations in sending for  Horses  and  Men  from Egypt to complete his stand∣ing Army and had also made Pharaoh another presumptuous military Tyrant his Ally which encouraged him to break his Oath and Covenant with the King of Babylon  But  when Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and  all his Army and all the Kingdoms of the Earth of his Do∣minion and all the People fought against Jerusalem and against all the Cities thereof  then God ordered his Prophet to remind Zedekiah of that dreadful Vengeance Defeat and Cap∣tivity  which had so often before been denounced as the necessary consequences of  Oppression and Injustice    Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel    viz  to Jeremiah  Go and speak to Zedekiah King of Judah and tell him Thus saith the Lord behold I will  give this City into the hand  of the King of Babylon and he shall burn it with fire And thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and  thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the King of Babylon  and he shall speak with thee  mouth to mouth  and thou shalt go to Babylon  c  Jer xxxiv to  The impending  Vengeance  being then become  visible  and consequently more tremendous by the near approach of the Babylonian Army that irresisti∣ble instrument in the hand of God by  which the Jews had so often been sub∣dued the King's stubborn heart began to relent and his  military confidence  to forsake him which had before encou∣raged his  Injustice  his firmness in  Worldly Politics  was shaken and yielded to a sense of Guilt It was upon this return of Conscience and right Reason that Zedekiah sent two Messengers Passur and Zephaniah to Jeremiah saying  Enquire I pray thee of the Lord for us for Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon maketh war against us if so be the Lord will  deal with us  according to  all his wondrous works  that he may go up from us  c  See chap xxi ver and But a very unwelcome answer was given to the Messengers to be returned to their Mo∣narch for the Prophet confirmed all the heavy Judgements  Then said Jeremiah unto them Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah Thus saith the Lord God of Israel Behold I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the King of Babylon and against the Chal∣deans which besiege you without the walls and I will bring them  into the midst  of this City And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched arm and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath And I will smite the Inhabitants of this City both Man and Beast they shall die of a great Pestilence And afterwards saith the Lord I will deliver  Zedekiah King of Ju∣dah  and  his Servants  and  the People  and such as are left in this City from the Pestilence from the Sword and from the Famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and into the hand of their Enemies and into the hand of those that seek their Life and he shall smite them with the Edge of the Sword he shall not spare them neither have Pity nor have Mercy  Jer xxi to  which had  before been denounced as well against the King expressly by name as against the City and its iniquitous Inhabitants whose notorious  Oppressions  were now  to be  RECOMPENSED  upon their own heads  MEASURE FOR MEASURE  Now is the end come upon thee and  I will send mine anger upon thee and will judge  thee according to thy ways  and will RECOMPENSE  upon thee all thine abo∣minations  c  Ezek vii See also the th th and th verses to the same effect And afterwards in the th verse one of the principal causes of GOD's  Vengeance  is mentioned  "Vio∣lence"  said the Prophet  is risen up into  a Rod of Wickedness  none of them shall remain nor of their mul∣titude nor of any of their's neither shall there be wailing for them The time is come the day draweth near  c  And again in the d verse  "Make a Chain"  said the Prophet  for the Land is full of  bloody Crimes  and the City is full of  Violence  Wherefore  I will bring the worst  of the Heathen and they shall possess their houses  c    Destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none Mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour  shall be upon rumour  c    The King shall mourn and the Prince shall be clothed with desolation and the Hands of the People of the Land shall be troubled  I will do unto them after their  own  way  and according to  their  deserts  or rather  their own judgements    will I judge them and they shall know that I am the Lord  Again in the th chapter the same reason is clearly assigned for the pouring out of God's Vengeance  Say unto the People of the Land Thus saith the Lord God of the Inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the Land of Israel They shall eat their Bread with Care∣fulness and drink their Water with Astonishment that her Land may be desolate from all that is therein  be∣cause of  THE VIOLENCE  of them that dwell therein  Ezek xii The nature of this baneful  Violence  which oc∣casioned their  destruction  is more parti∣cularly  described by the same Prophet in chap xxii ver  in the midst of thee  still speaking of Jerusalem  have they dealt by  Oppression  with  the Stranger  mark this ye British Slavedealers and Slaveholders  in thee have they vexed the Fatherless and the Widow Thou hast de∣spised mine holy things and hast pro∣faned my Sabbaths In thee are men that carry tales to shed Blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness  c    One hath com∣mitted abomination with his Neigh∣bour's Wife and another hath lewdly defiled his Daughterinlaw  c    In thee have they taken  gifts to shed Blood  thou hast taken Usury and Increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy Neighbours by Extor∣tion and hast forgotten me saith the Lord God Behold  therefore  I have  smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy Blood which hath been in the midst of thee  c  Ezek xxii  c  Oh that the Subjects of the British Empire would seriously compare these crimes with their own practices they would then surely be sensible of their danger and that they have reason to expect the like or rather much heavier Judgements than those denounced against the Jews For besides the no∣torious  Adulteries  and other acts of  Lewdness  which many amongst us from the frequency of such crimes commit even without shame or re∣morse we have far exceeded the guilt of the Jews I fear in many of the other points also which provoked the Vengeance of the Almighty against them What  "Violence"  amongst the Jews before their Captivity was ever  "risen up into"  so destructive  a Rod of Wickedness  as the AFRICAN SLAVETRADE now carried on chiefly by our  Liverpool  and  Bristol  Mer∣chants What  "bloody crime"  among the Jews was more notorious and more wickedly premeditated than the late  In∣vasion  and  Conquest  of the poor innocent CARRIBEES at ST VINCENT's And what Nation hath  dealt by Oppres∣sion with the Stranger  so generally so inhumanly and in so great a degree as our BRITISH AMERICAN SLAVEHOLDERSHave we not ample rea∣son to expect that the same tremendous decree will in God's Justice be ful∣filled upon these Kingdoms  De∣struction  cometh and they shall seek Peace and there shall be none Mis∣chief shall come upon mischief and rumour upon rumour  c c c    I will do unto them after  their  own  way  and according to  their  own  Judgements  will I judge them  c  Nevertheless God was pleased to offer the Jews a Choice in  their Fate  either to forsake their wicked King who had forfeited all right to govern by his neg∣lect of  Justice  and  Natural Right  and to fall away to the King's Enemies the Chaldeans or else to perish miserably in the City and partake of it's Destruc∣tion"And unto this People" said God to the Prophet Jeremiah  thou shalt say Thus saith the Lord Be∣hold I set before you the way of  Life  and the way of  Death  He that abideth in this City shall die by the Sword and by the Famine and by the Pestilence but he  that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his Life shall be unto him for a Prey  c  Jer xxi  The Prophet however was directed to add to his message a word of advice to the  King  and  Court  which shews that a seasonable repentance might even then have saved the State and turned away the impending  Vengeance  It was such advice too as every other Monarch who tolerates any  unnatural Bondage  or  Oppression  in his Dominions ought seriously to consider because the event proved it to be the best means of averting God's Anger if the King had but persevered in it  And touching  the House of the King of Judah  con∣tinued the Prophet  sayHear ye the Word of the Lord O House of Davidthus saith the Lord  Exe∣cute Judgement  in the morning and  deliver him that is spoiled  out of the hand of the  Oppressor  lest my Fury go out like Fire and burn that none can quench  it  because of the evil  of your doings  Jer xxi This is a manifest declaration that  the Neglect of  JUSTICE  and  RIGHT and  the Tolera∣tion of  OPPRESSION were the principal causes of God's heavy Vengeance against  that Royal House  The same advice was by God's Com∣mand repeated by the Prophet to  the King himself  IN HIS PALACE see the next chapter  Thus saith the Lord Go down to THE HOUSE of the King of Judah  and speak  THERE  this word  and say Hear the word of the Lord  O King of Judah  that fittest  upon the Throne of David  thou and thy Ser∣vants and thy People that enter in by these Gates" that is all Persons what∣ever that  enter in by  the Palacegates  plainly including  the whole Court  be∣fore whom the Prophet was to deliver his message  Thus saith the Lord  Execute  ye JUDGEMENT and RIGH∣TEOUSNESS  and  deliver the Spoiled out of the hand of  THE OPPRES∣SOR and do no wrong DO NO VIOLENCE TO THE STRAN∣GER  And what  "Wrong"  or  Violence to the Stran∣ger  can be more  oppressive  than that of detaining him in an  involuntary Servitude  WITHOUT WAGES in a miserable wretched  Bondage  worse than that of  brute Beasts    c    For if ye do this thing indeed  that is if ye will  execute Judgement and Righteousness deli∣ver the Oppressed c    then shall there enter in  by the Gates of this House  Kings sitting upon the Throne of David  or rather "that sit"  i e  reign "for David upon his Throne"  riding in Chariots and on Horses he and his Servants and his People  that is the Court should continue and prosper  But if ye will not hear THESE WORDS  I swear by my∣self saith the Lord    i e  Jehovah  "that THIS HOUSE"  i e  the Palace "shall become a desolation" Jer xxii to So that  the whole Court  were as much interested to promote a speedy Reformation as  the King himself  Thus it is plain that  the King and Court  had also a Choice given them of  Life  and  Death  as well as the People and con∣sequently that the Judgements de∣nounced were only  conditional  in case the warning was neglected for it is manifest that God mercifully tendered to them  even at the eve of their destruc∣tion  a continuance of the Monarchy  viz  Kings sitting upon the Throne of David    if they would but resolve to  execute  JUDGEMENT  and  RIGHTE∣OUSNESS  to  deliver the Spoiled out of the hand of the  OPPRESSOR  and to  do no Wrong  NO VIOLENCE  to  THE STRANGER  c  But the Prophet also added much more  advice  to  the King and his Court  though he was  not "  made of the King's Council  When a similar warning was given by a for∣mer Prophet to a wicked and inconsiderate Predecessor of  Zedekiah  concerning  God's impending Vengeance  for his misconduct the haughty Monarch puffed up with vain notions of his Royal Importance arrogantly im∣posed silence on the Prophet because he had under∣taken the office of  an Adviser  or  Counsellor  to the King without  the etiquette  or formality of a Court Appoint∣ment  "Art thou made of the King's Council"  said the Monarch  forbear why shouldest thou  be smit∣ten  Upon which the Prophet  forbore  indeed  to reason with him  but immediately pronounced upon him the severe sentence of God's Condemnation say∣ing  I know that God hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto  my Counsel  and it is remarkable that after  rejecting the Counsel  of God the  very next Counsel  which this imperious Monarch was pleased to adopt was attended with the most dangerous and humiliating consequences  both to King and Kingdom  that could possibly have happened nothing less than the delivery of both into the absolute power of their Enemies for after he had  silenced  the Prophet "then" says the Text  Amaziah King of Judah TOOK ADVICE and sent to Joash the Son of Jehoahaz the Son of Jehu King of Israel saying Come let us see one another in the face  The war was  unjust  and  unreasonable  and providentially the King and his  wicked Advisers  were punished by the effects of their own  unprincipled Counsel  See Chron xxv  " for he boldly warned the Monarch by the tremendous examples of God's Judgements upon three of his imme∣diate Predecessors in the Kingdom two of whom were  his own Brothers  the  Sons of King Josiah and the third  his own Nephew  whom he immediately succeeded They were all particularly mentioned by him in the proper order of their respective reigns as we find by the copy of his Message or Remon∣strance preserved in the Collection of his Prophecies and throughout the said Remonstrance frequent allusions are made to the principal causes of the failure and destruction of each of them which afford a most striking and inte∣resting Lesson to Kings and Governors  in general  but it must have been  more particularly  affecting to Zedekiah if we consider his critical situation at the  time the Message was delivered to him and that the Examples of  Vengeance  to which the Prophet referred him were  actually accomplished  in the Persons of his  nearest Relations  and  Predecessors  who were successively  deprived of their Royal Dignity  and carried away IN CHAINS into a  slavish Captivity  the very fate which the Prophet assured him was to be his own  But before I recite the remainder of God's Message to  the Court of Zedekiah  it will be necessary for me to give some general account of that Monarch and of his immediate Predecessors in order that the Remonstrance in which they are all distinctly mentioned may be more easily understood by the generality of Readers It will likewise be ne∣cessary for me to prove that the whole d Chapter of Jeremiah is included in that  Message  or  Remonstrance  which  the Prophet was then to deliver in the presence of the  whole Court  of Zede∣kiah And I propose to insert also some remarks as they occur concerning the Prophet himself and the order of time in which he delivered the several tre∣mendous predictions of GOD's  Vengeance  against these wicked Princes  Zedekiah was the Son of that excel∣lent Prince Josiah King of Judah on whose account expressly  the dreadful Vengeance  due to that wicked Nation was postponed for several years  viz  till after his death  The Scriptures mention four Sons of King Josiah  viz  the firstborn Jo∣hanan or John the second Je∣hoiakim the third Zedekiah and the fourth Shallum  Chron iii What became of the eldest Son  Johanan or John is not recorded  "this  Johanan  " says Bishop Patrick  is thought by many to be the same with  Jehoahaz  who succeeded  Josiah  in the Throne But he  mean∣ing  Jehoahaz    was not his firstborn being but twentythree years old when the People made him King and after three months time his Brother being put in his place is said to be twentyfive years old Kings xxiii Petavius  con∣tinues the Bishop  hath said a great deal about this in his Annotations upon Epiphanius ad Haeres Epicur p But after all  says the learned Bishop  I take the truth to be that  JOHANAN WAS HIS ELDEST SON  but died before his Father  and therefore is not mentioned in the Book of Kings as  continues he  Jehoahaz  is not men∣tioned here being made King by the People of the Land and presently dethroned  In the latter part of this remark however the worthy Bishop is appa∣rently mistaken for the same King who was some∣times called  Jehoahaz  is certainly  mentioned  in that very Text Chron iii on which the Bishop made this remark though mentioned indeed under a different name  viz Shallum  but all the others ascended the Throne of David and first of all the youngest Son  Shallum  whom on the death of King Josiah  the People of the Land took  and  as it seems without re∣gard  to seniority  made him King in his Father's stead in Jerusalem  Chron xxxvi  In this Text  Shallum  is called  Jehoahaz  which perhaps was his original or proper name and the other name  Shallum  only a surname signifying  Peace  given him probably by the People at his Corona∣tion and in remembrance of  the peace  and general tranquillity during the greatest part of his Father's reign but the great and learned Archbishop Usher just reversed this supposition for he was of opinion that  Shallum    Eum enim annos natum  senioribus Fratribus post∣habitis  Populus Regem Patris loco constituit Reg xxiii  Shallumi  nomine ut videtur melioris ominis causâ in aliud mutato quòd commune illud ei fuisset cum  Shallumo  Jabeshi filio qui unico tantùm mense regno potitus a Mana∣hemo est occisus  c  ad A M p  was the  proper  name and  Jehoahaz  only the surname  Nevertheless in defence of what I have ventured to mention as my own opinion I must remark that in the list of King  Josiah  's Sons where  Shallum  is men∣tioned with the rest of his Brothers  viz  Chron iii no less than  two  of his Brothers out of  three  are mentioned only by THE SURNAMES  which were given them when they began to reign  and the  third  Brother there mentioned or rather the  first  of them Johanan  never reigned  and therefore probably had no  surname  to distinguish him like the rest but the other two who actually ascended the Throne of Da∣vid were mentioned by their  surnames only viz  JE∣HOIAKIM  Jehovikim  signifying  Jeho∣vah will establish  and ZEDEKIAH  TsadokJehov  signifying  the Righteousness of Jehovah  for their  proper names  were  Eliakim  Kings xxiii and  Mattaniah  Kings xxiv and therefore it is very natural to conclude that the name of the  only remaining Brother who actually reigned  and is men∣tioned in the same Text  viz Shallum  signifying  Peace  is likewise  a surname  as well as the other two mentioned before him who received the names by which they are distinguished in that Text when they were first appointed to the Throne of Judah    The reign of  Shallum  alias  Jehoa∣haz  Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he  reigned three months in Jerusalem  And his Mother's name was Hamu∣tal the Daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah And he did  that which was evil in the sight of the Lord  ac∣cording to all that his Fathers had done  Kings xxiii  was only three months for he regarded not the  eternal Laws of God  and thereby drew down the  Di∣vine Vengeance  upon himself by the hand of PharaohNeco who deposed  him  at Jerusalem  And the King of Egypt  put him down at Jerusalem  and condemned the Land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold  Chron xxxvi  Chron xxxvi and afterwards  PUT HIM IN BANDS at  Riblah  RIBLAH was the fatal place where King  Ze∣dekiah  was afterwards  judged  and  condemned  by the King of Babylon and where  his Sons were slain before his eyes  Jer lii The Text also informs us that "he" the King of Babylon  slew also all the Princes of Judah in  RIBLAH  Jer lii There is some∣thing very remarkable in the meaning of these names  Riblah  and  Hamath  when compared with the  dreadful Vengeance  executed therein  Riblah    was capable of being interpreted though it likewise has a different meaning as follows  viz  "Rixa"  aut  jurgium  inveteratum vel conturbatum sive  jurgium  defluens  see the Interpretation of Scripture Names annexed to the London Polyglot Vol VI and HAMATH    "Ira  vel  indignatio  aut  calor" c ibid  that is the City of  Strife  or  severe Chiding  in the Land of  Wrath  or  fiery Indignation  Now it must appear very remarkable I say if we con∣sider the interpretation of which these names are ca∣pable that God should incline two foreign Conquerors who had no connection with each other but on the contrary were mortal Enemies to execute his  Ven∣geance  upon different Kings of Judah  exactly at the same place viz  the City of  Strife  in the Land of  Wrath  insomuch that one would suppose these names to be given afterwards in remembrance of God's  severe Vengeance  already executed therein And yet we find they were the ancient names of those places mentioned in Moses' account of the Israelitish boundary Numb xxxiv And though the names are really capable of bearing a different and more favourable interpreta∣tion yet to the Jews who were nice observers con∣cerning the real meaning of names the possibility of interpreting the names of these fatal places in the awful sense which I have mentioned must render the accomplishment of  God's Vengeance  therein much more striking and remarkable  in the Land of  Hamath  that he might not reign in  Jerusalem  Kings xxiii  And PharaohNechoh  put him in bands  at Riblah in the Land of Hamath  that he might not reign in Jerusalem  c  Kings xxiii  there being pro∣bably some reason to apprehend that he would attempt to supplant his elder brother  Eliakim  whom the Egyptian Conqueror had thought proper to set up in his stead upon  the Throne of Da∣vid  and therefore to secure the  newestablished Monarch he not only put  Shallum  IN BANDS but also carried him away with him into Captivity in Egypt  where he died  And PharaohNechoh made  Eliakim  the Son of Josiah King in the room of Josiah his Father and turned his name to  Jehoiakim  and took Jehoahaz away and he came to Egypt and he died there  Kings xxiii    Thus Eliakim through the Mercy of God to  "the House of David"  was raised to the Throne and Kingdom of his Ancestors even by  a foreign Enemy  who also changed his Name that the Providence of God might be more ap∣parent in the Revolution from  Eliakim    signifying  God will establish  to  Jehoiakim  signifying as I have be∣fore remarked  "Jehovah will establish"  whereby it is manifest that even a Hea∣then Monarch took pains to remind the new King of Judah of his dependence on  Jehovah  the God of Israel whose  Laws  and  Religion  of course we may presume were likewise  reestablished  in Judea by the same foreign Authority for it would have been absurd in the Egyptian Mo∣narch to have changed the Name of his Royal Vassal to another Name more par∣ticularly testifying a Belief in  Jehovah  the true God of Israel if he did not mean thereby to keep the Jewish King in con∣stant remembrance of the  National  Pro∣fession of  Law  and  Religion  by the sacred Name of the great Author of them  The same remarkable change in the Name of a future King of Judah was made also by another foreign and Hea∣then Conqueror afterwards  in honour of the eternal  JEHOVAH so that it was manifestly  the Providence of God  which inclined these two great Enemies of the Jewish State though they were also mortal Enemies to each other I mean Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar to pur∣sue  exactly  the same method  in restoring  "the Sceptre of Judah"  to  the House of David  and in declaring the Estab∣lishment of  the National Law  and  Re∣ligion  by putting a respectful memorial of the sacred Name of  Jehovah  upon the newraised Monarchs  In the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign though Judea and all Syria were then under the Egyptian Empire the Pro∣phet Jeremiah in his th chapter    In the beginning of the reign of  Jehoi∣akim  the Son of Josiah King of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying Thus saith the LORD or the LORD said to me make ye Bonds and Yokes and put them upon thy Neck and send them to the King of Edom  c  The learned Dr Lowth Prebendary of Winchester in in his Commentary on this place supposes that the Name of "Jehoiakim  has crept into the Text" c  instead of Zedekiah "This emendation" says he  is confirmed by comparing this verse with the d th and th verses of this chapter and with the beginning of the next  But these verses how∣ever  are far from confirming the proposed emenda∣tion all that can properly be said of them in this re∣spect is that they have occasioned in some Writers the supposition of an Error in the Text which has been very well answered by others But there is a better evidence in favour of the Doctor's supposition than what he has mentioned because the latter really contains no difficulty if the d and th verses be con∣sidered as  prophecies  "These things" says the learned  Lightfoot    are to be un∣derstood to be spoken  prophetically  concerning  Zedekiah  as well as concerning  Nebuchadnezzar  's Sonnes for the Lord by the Prophet foretells that  Nebuchadnezzar  should reigne and his Sonne and Grandchilde after him and therefore must the Prophet presently make Yokes and Bonds and put them of his own neck in token of Judah's subjection which indeed begun in the very next yeare And he foretells us withall that  Zedekiah  should reigne and that divers Kings should send Mes∣sengers to him and by them should  Jeremy  send those Yokes to those Kings  c  Harmony of the Old Testament p and  of the future reigns of  Zede∣kiah  and  Nebuchadnezzar  but the evidence which he has  not  mentioned leaves much more room for the supposition of a various reading in the Text for the  Syriac Version  has really the reading which that learned Gentleman supposes to be the true one  viz  in the beginning of the reign of  Tsedekia  instead of  in  the beginning of the reign of  Jehoiakim  This evidence certainly proves either that the Hebrew Copy from which the version was made had really the reading supposed by Dr Lowth or else that the Translator himself thought like Dr Lowth that the word  JEHOIAKIM  had crept into the Text instead of  ZEDEKIAH  and therefore was willing to correct the supposed error in his new version and as the lat∣ter is neither  impossible  nor  improbable  the evidence of the Syriac Version must by no means be admitted to invalidate the present Hebrew Reading especially as the latter is confirmed not only by all the ancient Hebrew Manuscripts that have hitherto been collated but also by the Targum of Jonathan who flourished years before the destruction of the second Temple as Bishop Walton relates  Floruit hic centum annis ante Templi secundi vastatio∣nem ut habetur in Talm Fract de Sabbato c  In Biblia Polyglotta Prolegom p  so that his Translation is  older  than  the oldest  Syriac Version which is suffi∣ciently proved in the Prolegomena to the Polyglott Bible by the same learned Bishop The  whole verse  is wanting in the  Greek Version  so that no evidence can be drawn from thence  foretold  the universal Empire of  Nebu∣chadnezzar King of Babylon  even  before that great Warrior was King of Babylon  Which was not till the latter end of the third year of Jehoiakim for part of the third and part of the fourth years of Jehoiakim were included in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar Compare Dan i with Jer xxv This was the earliest computation there being two of Nebuchadnezzar's reign for Dean  Prideaux  remarks that  Daniel  begins his computation from the time that  Nebuchadnezzar  was sent from Babylon by his Father on this expedition  for he is speaking of Nebuchadnezzar's success in recovering  Syria  and  Palestine  from PharaohNechoh "which" says he  was in the latter end of the third year of Jehoiakim  c  See Connections part I p  But according to the Babylonians his reign is not reckoned to begin till after his Father's death which happened two years afterwards and both computations being found in Scripture it is necessary to say so much here for the reconciling of them  Ibid  p  his Father  Nabopollasar  who was also called  Nebuchodonosor  The learned Archbishop  Usher  shews that  Nabuchadonosor  was a name given to  Saosduchinus  the Successor of Esarhaddon in the Assyrian and Babylo∣nian Empire and that he was the  Nabuchadonosor  mentioned in the Book of Judith See his Annals under the years of the world and That  Chynaladan  called also  Sarac  succeeded this  Nabu∣chadonosor  in the Empire A M that Nabopol∣lasar the Father of Nebuchadnezzar who was Com∣mander in Chief of his Forces rebelled against his Master  Sarac  and jointly with  Asstyages  called also  Assuerus  King of the Medes conquered Sarac and  took Nineveh  And it seems that Nabopollasar at that time had assumed the name of  Nabuchadonosor  the great Ancestor of his Master for according to Arch∣bishop  Usher  Nabopollasar is mentioned under that name in the Book of Tobit A M  viz  Nabopollasarus Babylonius à Saraco sive Chyna∣ladano Assyriorum Chaldaeorum Rege  praefectus exercitui  the example should warn Monarchs against the keeping of great Standing Armies  Astyages à Patre Cyaxare Mediae Satrapa constitu∣tus affinitatem ineuntes Amyiti Astyagis Filiâ Nebucadnesari Filio Nabopollasari desponsatâ junctis vitibus Niniven in eâ  Saracum

had enslaved and carried away his Countrymen the Isra∣elites from their an cient Inheritance  being still alive The Prophet was di∣rected  to make  Bonds  and  Yokes  and put them upon his own neck and to send  them afterwards to the Kings of several neighbouring Nations with a most aw∣ful message from God concerning the rising power of the Babylonian Monarch "And now" said the Prophet in the Name of the Lord or  Jehovah  of Hosts the God of Israel see ver  have I given all these Lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar  the King of Ba∣bylon my Servant  c    and all Nations  many of whom are ex∣pressly mentioned in the third verse  shall serve HIM and his SON and his SON'S SON until the very time of his Land come  for the Empire continued for  three lives  or  successions  until the Babylonian measure of iniquity and oppression was fulfilled in the reign of Belthazar  The several Histories cited by the learned Gro∣tius in the th Sect of his d Book  de Veritate Reli∣gionis Christianae  concerning the Chaldean Monarchs are by no means well chosen for the laudable purpose he intended and he refers the Reader also to Scaliger whose Hypothesis concerning those Monarchs is clogged with insurmountable difficulties See Uni∣versal History Vol IV p But Dean Prideaux has clearly proved that  Nabonadius the last King of Babylon  called Labynetus by Herodotus  was the same with him that in Scripture is called  Bel∣shazzar  and that he was the Son of  Evilmerodach  by Nitocris his Queen and so SON'S SON to Nebu∣chadnezzar and that whereas he is called the Son of Nebuchadnezzar in the th chapter of  Daniel  and  Nebuchadnezzar  is there called his Father this is to be understood in the large sense wherein any Ancestor upward is often called Father and any Descendant down ward Son according to the usual stile of Scripture  Connection of the Old and New Testaments Part I p See also DrLowth's Comment on Jeremiah  when the  Medes  and  Persians  were to RETALIATE upon them THE HARD SLAVERY of Israel  and then  continues the Prophet  many Nations and great Kings shall SERVE  themselves  OF HIM  c  Jer xxvii that is they shall ENSLAVE his People in the same manner that he and his two Successors  enslaved  and  op∣pressed  other Nations rendering  Slavery  for  Slavery  In the same chapter ZEDEKIAH is also mentioned by name as  King of Ju∣dah  In the beginning of the reign of JEHOIA∣KIM the Son of Josiah King of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying Thus saith the Lord to me make ye  Bonds and Yokes  and put them upon thy neck and send them to the King of Edom and to the King of Moab  c  by the hand of the Messengers which come to Jerusa∣lem unto ZEDEKIAH  King of Judah  c  Jer xxvii to The learned Archbishop of Armagh has taken notice of this chapter as a Prophecy  In principio etiam regni  Jehoiakimi  Jeremias prae∣dixisse dicitur SEDEKIAM Regem Judae futu∣rum  Nebucadnesarem  Regem Babyloniae eúmque Gentes finitimas dominatui suo subjecturum  for which he refers to this th chapter of Jeremiah from the st to the th verse A M  several years before he received the name of ZEDEKIAH so that nei∣ther he himself whose proper name was Mattaniah nor any other person could possibly know in the beginning of  Je∣hoiakim  's reign what particular person was then signified by the name of  Ze∣dekiah  for even  Nebuchadnezzar  him∣self who afterwards gave him that  name was not  King of Babylon  when the Prophecy was delivered as I have already remarked But after this  foreign Conqueror  had really appointed  a King of Judah  and given him the name of ZEDEKIAH  the very name foretold by the Prophet  such an extraordinary circum∣stance would add unquestionable autho∣rity to the truth of  Jeremiah  's mission and would render  Zedekiah  and his Cour∣tiers  inexcusable  as they really were for rejecting the earnest and repeated Re∣monstrances of that Prophet  If this probable confirmation of the word of Prophecy be duly considered it will add much to the weight of the Observations which I have made in a preceding Note concerning the Truth of the Hebrew Text in the st verse of this chapter    This timely Prediction therefore in the reign of Jehoiakim with the inter∣nal Proofs which it contained concern∣ing the necessity of  Zedekiah  's Submission  to the Babylonian Yoke seems to have been absolutely necessary to enable the Prophet to confute the many  false Pro∣phets Diviners Dreamers c  see th verse who were afterward in  Zede∣kiah  's reign publickly employed to ex∣cite the People to shake off  the Babylo∣nian Yoke  The Prophet was also forewarned in the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign as the same chapter testifies that the Kings of Edom Moab Ammon Tyre and Zidon would send Messengers to a  Ze∣dekiah  King of Judah  all which Kings as Grotius remarks  Omnes enim hi Reges subjugati a Nebuchado∣nosoro Vide infra xlviiixlix Comment on the d verse Annot ad Vet Test p  were subdued by Nebuchadnezzar and there∣fore it is not improbable that the said Messengers or Ambassadors were sent to  Zedekiah  for the purpose of forming  a league against the Babylonian  "Nempe ut eum sollicitarent" says Gro∣tius  ad defectionem à Chaldaeo De qua vide Paral xxxvi  Ibid  p  "Their business" says the learned Dr Lowth  was either to congratulate  Zedekiah  upon his acces∣sion to the Throne  or else to engage him  IN A LEAGUE  against the King of Babylon  Comment on Jerem p  Power the public declarations of the false Prophets abovementioned and the actual REBELLION soon afterwards of  Zedekiah  himself renders the said sup∣position about the business of the Mes∣sengers very probable so that if this singular state of affairs be considered the sending at such a seasonable time to the several neighbouring Kings by the return of their Ambassadors the Yokes which had been worn by Jeremiah to∣gether with GOD's awful Message that he would punish that Nation which will not  serve  Nebuchadnezzar and put their  Neck under his  Yoke  see ver  And it shall come to pass that the  Nation  and  Kingdom  which will not serve the same Nebu∣chadnezzar the King of Babylon and  that will not put their nick  UNDER THE YOKE  of the King of Ba∣bylon  that Nation will I punish saith the LORD with the Sword with the Famine and with the Pestilence until I have consumed them by his hand  Jer xxvii  must needs strike these Heathen Mo∣narchs if they were not entirely aban∣doned in their principles with Fear and Reverence especially as their Am∣bassadors would hear at  Jerusalem  that the Divine Message concerning the  Yokes then sent  had been revealed to the Prophet long before thirteen or fourteen years in the beginning of  Je∣hoiakim  's reign in token of which the Prophet had worn  Yokes  upon his own neck see chap xxviii ver and that no less than three circum∣stances of that extraordinary Revelation were now already fulfilled the Pro∣phet  having not only foretold the reign of Nebuchadnezzar and the reign of Zedekiah  a name  not applicable to  Ze∣dekiah  himself till the Babylonian Con∣queror thought proper to give it him so that no worldly prudence could fore∣see such an event but had also foretold the very circumstance in which they themselves were concerned  viz  that  Messengers  should be sent to this  Zedekiah  by such and such Kings  In what year these Messengers or Ambassadors really arrived at Jerusalem or returned from thence does not ap∣pear but as the  Yokes  were first of all  to be put upon the Prophet's own neck  be∣fore he was to send them to the Kings compare the d and d verses and as it appears that he really wore such a wooden  Yoke  as a sign against them in the Temple so late as the th year of Zedekiah when a false Prophet took it  from his neck and broke it and there∣by occasioned a further command re∣specting those Kings  viz  that the Prophet should  make for them  Yokes of Iron  "Thus saith the Lord Thou" Hananiah "hast broken  the Yokes of Wood  but thou" Jeremiah "shalt make for them Yokes of Iron" Jer xxviii    it seems most probable that  the wooden Yokes  first ordered had not  then  been sent to them and con∣sequently that the Messengers of those Kings had not as yet arrived at Jerusa∣lem for undoubtedly the Prophet would obey the Divine Command as soon as he had the proper opportunity of doing so and as  Zedekiah  went to Ba∣bylon  in the same year  see Jer li it is likely the Messengers did not  ar∣rive  nor he  rebel  till the year follow∣ing Nevertheless in that year the fourth of Zedekiah the Prophet de∣clared the Message to Zedekiah him∣self which he had before been charged  to send to the other Kings  I spake also  says he in ch xxvii ver  to  Zedekiah  King of Judah according to all these words  that is  accord∣ing to all these words  which precede in the same chapter respecting  the Yokes  and which had been revealed in the reign of  Jehoiakim    saying Bring your necks under THE YOKE of the King of Babylon and  serve  him and his people and LIVE Why will ye  die  thou and thy people by the Sword by the Famine and by the Pestilence as the Lord hath spoken  against the  NATION  that will not  SERVE  the King of Babylon  c  See ver and The Almighty had laid upon all the other Nations of Pa∣lestine and Syria THE SAME FATAL NECESSITY either  to submit to a foreign Yoke  or DIE So that we have here a very remarkable example of GOD's VENGEANCE AND RETRIBUTION upon  several  wicked  and  corrupt Nations  which regarded not  the eternal Laws  of God They must either  serve  the King of Babylon or  be destroyed  there was no alternative BE DESTROYED  by the Sword by the Famine and by the Pestilence  as the Lord hath spoken  compare the th verse with the th  until I have consumed them  BY HIS HAND  that is by the hand of  the Babylonian Conqueror  the appointed Instrument of God's temporal Ven∣geance and the GOD OF ARMIES  hath in all ages raised up some powerful  Scourges  of this kind to punish wicked and ungrateful Nations with  Fire and Sword  and to reduce them to  an unnatural Bondage  on ac∣count of  National Iniquities  Even the present state of Mankind affords some melancholy proofs of this How many Nations now subsisting in the world have forfeited their  natural Liberty  and  are now sitting under the IRON YOKES of  unnatural arbitrary Governments  sub∣jected to the WILL AND PLEASURE of their respective Sovereigns instead of LAW And if the particular History of any or perhaps all of these  Nations  be carefully examined it will not I be∣lieve be found that any of them were ever reduced to such a deplorable state of  national  Misery till by  national  Wick∣edness and  public  Contempt of GOD's  eternal Laws  they had rendered a  na∣tional  RETRIBUTION strictly necessary according to the unerring Rules of eter∣nal Justice All hopes therefore of REDRESS to  these enslaved Nations  must be vain without a sincere reformation of manners in each Nation respectively and without  public  and most earnest  na∣tional  or  general  endeavours to obtain  Reconciliation and Forgiveness from  THE KING OF KINGS as nothing but  a strict Obedience to  HIS LAWS  can render  any Nation truly  FREE Jeremiah made the same declaration also to the  Priests  and  People  that he had made to the  King  "Also I spake" says he  to  the Priests  and to  all the People  say∣ing Thus saith the LORD Hearken not to the words of your  Prophets  that prophesy unto you saying Be∣hold the Vessels of the Lord's House shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon for they  prophesy a Lye  These lying Prophets were probably bribed to favour the proposed  league  against Babylon as some other wicked  Prophets  had been on former occasions according to the testimony of the Prophet Micah "And the Prophets thereof" speaking of Jerusalem "  divine sor money"  Micah iii And  Nehemiah  also mentions a Prophet one  Shemaiah  who was  hired  to prophesy against him  for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him  Nehem vi to  unto you Hearken not unto them  serve  the King of Baby∣lon and  live  Wherefore should this City be laid waste  Jer xxvii  The wicked Prophets who thus mis∣led the People with Lyes presumed nevertheless to use the sacred Name of JEHOVAH    They prophesy a Lye unto you For I have not sent them saith the Lord  JEHOVAH "yet they prophesy  a Lye in my Name" c  Jer xxvii  as if they had really de∣clared the Will of GOD so that the true Prophet had need not only of all those unquestionable Proofs of his  Di∣vine Mission  which I have already men∣tioned but even of other Proofs also to enable him to oppose the lying Prophets who pretended to speak in the Name of JEHOVAH as well as himself for  in the same year  that is in the fourth of Zedekiah one of these wicked  Pro∣phets  Hananiah  the Son of Azur the Prophet which was of  Gibeon  Gibeon  was the place where the Tabernacle for∣merly stood for many years Chron xxi Kings iii and was therefore an ancient seat of the true Prophetssuch as  Azur  the Father of this  Hananiah  probably was so that as Hananiah and the other false Prophets also pretended to prophesy in the sacred Name of  Jehevah  they would be very liable to gain credit with the People especially as they told them such things as most flattered the national inclination of those times  viz  to be free from the Babylonian Yoke    took  the Yoke  from off the Prophet  Jeremiah  's neck and brake it And  Hananiah  spake  in the Temple  in the presence of all the People saying Thus saith the LORD Even so will I break the Yoke of Nebuchad∣nezzar King of Babylon from the neck of all Nations within the space of two full years  Jer xxviii Upon which it seems the Prophet  Jeremiah  was directed by God to reprove  Hana∣niah  with a severe sentence for he not only declared that  "Yokes of Iron"  should be substituted instead of the  Yokes of Wood  Then the Word of the Lord came unto  Je∣remiah the Prophet  after that  Hananiah  the Pro∣phet had broken the Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah saying Go and tell  Hananiah  saying Thus saith the Lord Thou hast  broken the Yokes of Wood  but thou shalt make for  them Yokes of Iron  Jer xxviii    which Hananiah had  broken as I before remarked but he also pointed out the lying Prophet him∣self to the public observation as a no∣table and undeniable token that the Prophecies of  Jeremiah  were of Divine Authority"Hear now  Hananiah  " said the true Prophet "the Lord"  i e Jehovah  hath not sent thee but  thou makest this People to trust in a Lye  Therefore thus saith the LordBehold  I will cast thee forth from the face of the earth This Year thou shalt  DIE because thou hast taught Rebellion against the Lord So  Hananiah the Prophet  DIED  the same year in the seventh month  Jer xxviii That is he died ex∣actly two months after the Prediction which was made in  the fifth month  of  the fourth year of Zedekiah Such Evidence added to the former clear Tokens of Authenticity which this Pro∣phecy of  the Yokes  carried with it must render  Zedekiah  and his Courtiers to∣tally inexcusable for neglecting the Di∣vine Warning and relying upon false Prophets  Thus the propriety of considering the former part of the th chapter as a Re∣velation in the time of  Jehoiakim  agree∣able to the testimony of the Hebrew Text is rendered apparent by the par∣ticular advantages which such a prior Revelation would afterwards give to the true Prophet when he had to oppose the pretended Prophecies delivered in the fourth year of  Zedekiah  and the remaining part of the th chapter from the th verse wherein the Pro∣phet mentions his personal Address to  Zedekiah  must necessarily be attributed  to a  future time  Alia est sectio says  Grotius  upon this verse    ad aliud tempus pertinens  sed argumento conjuncta cum superiori  Grot Annot ad Vet Test  which in the fol∣lowing chapter the th is expressly declared to have been  in the fourth year of Zedekiah  Chap xxviii  And it came to pass THE SAME YEAR  in the beginning of the reign of  ZEDE∣KIAH  King of Judah in the  FOURTH YEAR  and in the fifth month  that Hananiah  c    In the beginning also of Jehoiakim's reign the Prophet Jeremiah was seized by the Priests and the People in the Temple for denouncing  God's Vengeance  against  the Nation the Temple also  on account of the  national  Wickedness  and the City  In the beginning of the reign of  Jehoiakim  the Son of Josiah King of Judah came this word from the Lord saying Thus saith the Lord Stand  in the Court of the  LORD's  House  and speak unto  all the Cities of Judah which come to worship in  the Lord's House  all the words that I command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word If so be they will hearken and turn every man from HIS EVIL WAY that I may  repent me  OF THE EVIL  which I purpose to do unto them because of  THE EVIL  of their doings  This is God's  Law of Retribution Evil  for  Evil Measure  for  Measure  which nothing but Repentance and Conformity to God's Laws could avert  And thou shalt say unto them Thus faith the LORD  if ye will not hearken to me  TO WALK IN MY LAW which I have set  before you  to hearken to the words of my Servants the Prophets whom I sent unto you both rising up early and sending  them  but ye have not hearkened Then will I make THIS HOUSE like SHILOH  Shiloh was probably  desolate  from the time of Eli's death when the Ark was taken by the Philistines for  the old Taber∣nacle made by Moses  was afterwards pitched  on the High Place  at  Gibeon  Chron xxi and continued there till the time of Solomon when the Temple was built Chron i The removal was probably made by  Samuel  whose House was at  Rama  as also  the Altat  which he built Sam vii and  Rama  was in the neighbourhood of  Gibeon Gibeah  or  Geba  which if not the same place with  Rama  which also signifies  a high place  was at least adjoining to it as they are frequently men∣tioned together in Scripture See Sam xxii Ezra ii Nehem vii Isa x Hosea v  and will make THIS CITY  a curse to all the Nations of the  Earth  So the Priests and the Prophets and all the People heard Jeremiah speaking these words  in the House of the  LORD  Jer xxvi Thus it is manifest that the public exercise of the  National Re∣ligion  agreeable to the  National Law  was continued even in the beginning of  Jehoiakim  's reign though he was set up and ruled under the authority of a foreign Heathen Monarch PharaohNeco for the d verse testifies that the People out of all the Cities of Judah came to worship in the Lord's House  and was arraigned  and tryed for it as for a CAPITAL OF∣FENCE before  the Princes and all the  Congregation  Upon the Trial the Prophet persisted in his former declara∣tion but at the same time assured them of Mercy and Reconciliation in case they would but repent and reform so that it was absolutely in their own power through the Mercy of God to have averted  the impending Vengeance  "Therefore NOW" said the Prophet  amend your ways and your doings  and obey the Voice of the LORD your GOD  and then he adds the condi∣tional Assurance of Peace  and the LORD  said the Prophet  will re∣pent him of  THE EVIL  that he hath  pronounced against you  To this the Prophet added a short Remonstrance respecting his own case  As for me  says he  I am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you But know ye for certain  that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon your∣selves and upon this City and upon the Inhabitants thereof  for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears  Jer xxvi Whereupon he was acquitted and dismissed for some of the Elders cited clear precedents from the history of former times concerning the legality of declaring  God's Vengeance  against  National Wickedness  but though this prudent judgement of the Court of Justice saved  Jeremiah  for that time yet it did not prevent the wicked Monarch  Jehoiakim  from murdering the Prophet's Colleague  Urijah  who likewise pro∣phesied  against the City and against the Land according to all the words of Jeremiah  This would include all that  Jeremiah  had pro∣phesied in the reign of King  Josiah  as well as in the times above mentioned under  Shallum  and  Jehoiakim  The Prophecies delivered in the reign of  Josiah  ac∣cording to the learned  Lightfoot  are contained in  the twelve first chapters  but  the thirteenth chapter and all that follow to the one and twentieth  I conceive  says the same judicious Writer  to have been de∣livered in the time of  Jehoiakim  and not in the time of Josiah  c  See his Reasons at length Harmony of the Old Testament p    but his blood was severely avenged some years afterwards in the fatal catastrophe of the Tyrant  Thus it appears that  Jehoiakim  was as little mindful of  the Laws and Reli∣gion of  JEHOVAH notwithstanding the memorial of that  sacred Name  which  Pharaoh  had placed upon him as his Predecessor  Shallum  for we read also in the d book of Chronicles xxxvi that  he did that which was  evil in the  sight of the Lord    i e  Jehovah  his God  And the account of  God's Vengeance  immediately follows the de∣claration of the Monarch's Ingratitude for "Against him" continues the Text  came up Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and  bound him in fetters  to carry him to Babylon  In the book of Daniel we find that the siege of Jerusalem began in  the third year of Jehoiakim  In  THE THIRD YEAR  of the reign of Jehoia∣kim  King of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it  Dan i  but it seems the Babylonians did not immediately succeed in their enterprize for we read in the book of Jeremiah an account of several transactions in the  fourth year of Jehoi∣akim  vel ut noster Joseph observat says  L'Em∣pereur  in his Annotations on Joseph Ichiia's Para∣phrase on  Daniel    annum NEBUCADNEZARIS primum statuamus incidisse in annum Jehoiakimi  tertium desinentem  imprimis  quartum incipientem  ita ut NEBUCADNEZAR venisse dicatur JEHO∣JAKIMI  anno tertio

JEHOIAKIMI  primus  NEBUCADNEZ∣ARIS idem principium non haberent  c  p  and among the rest that  the Prophet  Jeremiah  in  that very year  denounced the Judgement of God upon Jerusalem and Judea by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar which proves that the City was not as yet taken by him for in the fourth year of  Jehoiakim  he acquainted all the Inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem that  from the thirteenth year of  Josiah  the Son of  Amon  King of Judah  even to this day  said the Prophet  that is the three and twen∣tieth year  the Word  of the Lord hath come unto me and I have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened  c    Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts  Jehovah of Hosts  Be∣cause ye have not heard my words behold I will send and take all the Families of the North saith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon my Servant and will bring them against this Land and against the Inhabitants thereof and against  all these Nations  round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an Astonishment and an Hissing and perpetual  The word  here construed  perpetual  does not  necessarily  bear that signification for it some∣times denotes a shorter period so that Buxtorf inter∣prets it in his Lexicon as follows  "Seculum"  says he  tempus homini absconditum tam  infinitum aeternum  quàm  finitum  ut Gen xvii Exod xxi Sam i and xiii Sam xii  c  So that the words  may rather sig∣nify some limited term of  DesolationsDesolations of  or for  an age  or  a certain period  as it is rendered in the interlineary version of the London Polyglot Bible  "In Solitudines Seculi"  Buxtorf in his Lexicon re∣marks that  Raschi  and  Aben Ezra  interpret the word  to signify a space of fifty years The  Deso∣lations  spoken of in the above Text certainly were not  perpetual  and though the particular duration of them is not there declared yet the several Histories which mention the return from Captivity sufficiently prove that they were  limited  to some such term of years as  Raschi  and  AbenEzra  have attributed to the word  for the  Servitude  to Babylon on which the  Desolations  depended were expressly  limited  to seventy years see ver and the total  Desolation  did not continue so long as the  Captivity  by about twenty years  De∣solations  Jer xxv And as  the Denunciations of  GOD's  Vengeance  were generally accompanied with Promises of future Reconciliation and Comfort in case of Amendment so  the Servitude to Babylon  was here expressly  limited  to the term of  serventy years    And these Nations shall SERVE the King of Babylon SEVENTY YEARS  Jer xxv  and as a further sign of God's Providence and Care of his People the Prophet at the same time denounced a heavy RETRI∣BUTION OF VENGEANCE against  the King of Babylon and that Nation  the  Instruments of God's Vengeance  And it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished  that  I will punish  the King of Babylon and that Nation  saith the LORD for their iniquity and the Land of the Chaldeans and will make it perpetual Desolations  c  For many Nations and great Kings shall SERVE THEMSELVES OF THEM ALSO and I will RECOMPENSE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS  mark this ye  Slaveholders  and  Tyrants  of the Earth  and ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF THEIR OWN HANDS  Jer xxv Here is a just  Retaliation  for  TyrannySlavery  for  Slavery  as also against many neighbouring  Na∣tions  who were made to drink of  the Winecup of this Fury    ie  the Sword and Captivity which remarkable cir∣cumstance as here foretold should teach ALL NATIONS to the end of the World the Necessity which God has laid on them to take warning by the several Examples of  his Vengeance and Retribu∣tion upon the Jewish  NATION because the Prophet was directed to assure the  other Nations  that if God spared not  his own  peculiar People  he  surely  would not spare them  "And it shall be" said God to the Prophet  if they refuse to take the Cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them Thus saith THE LORD OF HOSTS" Jehovah of Hosts  Ye shall certainly drink  For lo I begin to bring evil  on the City which is called by my Name and should ye be utterly unpunished  Ye shall not be unpunished FOR I WILL CALL FOR A SWORD UPON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH SAITH THE LORD OF HOSTS  Jer xxv This Declaration hath been fulfilled upon all Nations of the World at different times and  the Sword of God's Wrath is still as active as ever    The th chapter of Jeremiah from the beginning to the th verse is next in order of date because it relates to transactions of the same year  viz  the fourth year of Jehoiakim which must be during the Siege of Jerusalem by Ne∣buchadnezzar who came up in the third year of Jehoiakim The Prophet was then directed to write in the Roll of a Book all his former Prophecies  from  "the days of Josiah"  to that time  And it came to pass in the fourth year of  Jehoiakim  the Son of  Josiah  King of Judah that this word came unto  Jeremiah  from the LORD saying Take thee a Roll of a Book and write therein all the Words that I have spoken unto thee against  Israel  and against  Judah  and against  all the Na∣tions  from the day I spake unto thee from the days of Josiah  even unto this day  It may be that the House of Judah will hear  all the evil  which I pur∣pose to do unto them that they may return every man from his  evil  way  that I may forgive their ini∣quity and their sin  Jer xxxvi So that  Repentance  might still have prevented  "all the evil"  See Jer xxxvi The Book was wrote however by  Baruch  the Scribe from the mouth of  Jeremiah  who was then in prison Jer xxxvi  Then Jeremiah called  Baruch  the Son of  Neriah  and  Baruch  wrote from the mouth of  Jere∣miah  all the Words of the Lord which he had spoken unto him upon a Roll of a Book And  Jeremiah  commanded  Baruch  saying  I am shut up I cannot go into the House of the Lord  therefore go thou and read in the Roll which thou hast written from my mouth the Words of the LORD in the ears of the People in the LORD's House upon the  Fasting Day  c  Jer xxvii  This  Fasting Day  as Archbishop  Usher  remarks was that solemn Annual Fast ordained in the Law to be kept on the th day of the seventh month for ever five days before the Feast of Tabernacles  Solen∣nis videlicèt illius mensis septimi die decimo quotannis celebrati Levit xvi xxiii Num xxix quinque diebus ante Festum Taber∣naculorum in quo omnes mares ex omnibus civi∣tatibus Judae comparebant Hierosolymis  Ad A M p  and Je∣remiah  directed Baruch to read the Book to the People in the Temple upon a public Fastday See ver  The th chapter of Jeremiah seems to be the next in order of time and contains the Prophet's Rebuke    And seekest thou great things for thy∣self seek them not for behold  I will bring evil upon all Flesh  saith the Lord  He nevertheless added a promise of life to Baruch by way of comfort saying  but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest  Jer xlv  of Baruch for expressing his fears for him∣self  when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of  Jeremiah in the fourth year of  JEHOIAKIM  c  see ver which plainly refers us to the time and circumstances mentioned in the th chapter Archbishop Usher informs us that  perhaps  the th and st chapters of Jeremiah containing comfortable Promises of future Restau∣ration are to be referred to the time of delivering the th chapter  "Jer xlv Quò  fortasse  " says the Arch∣bishop  referenda fuerint capita illa duo consola∣toria Jer xxx xxxi Promissiones de instaurandâ Ecclesiâ continentia  ad A M but after∣wards he seems with more certainty to date them in the year See p The th chapter of Jeremiah was fulfilled about this time that is  in the fourth year of Jehoiakim  as the d verse declares and the Prophecies against Egypt therein contained were probably declared about the same time with those against  Jehoiakim  to shew that Monarch his folly in trusting to the armies of Pharaoh  Of the same date with the th chapter we may well suppose the th and th chapters to be also because the d verse of chap xlvi doth use a comprehensive expression The Word of the LORD  against the Gentiles  as con∣cluding all these Sermons and Prophecies against these several Nations under one date and head only chap xlvii and ver of chap xlix are of several specified dates  Lightfoot's Harmony p  but  he afterwards assigns them another date with more certainty And to the same year the fourth of Jehoiakim that learned Prelate also places the th chap∣ter concerning the  Rechabites  ingressi sunt Hierosolyma Jer xxxv Ubi quum de tempore praesente dicant  ita couside∣mus Hierosolymis  colligimus capitis hujus historiam de vino a  Rechabitis  recusato eo tempore fuisse ges∣tam quo Urbs à  Nebuchadnesare  fuit obsessa  Dan i  Ibid  ad A M p  for with good reason he supposes that the circumstances therein related con∣cerning their refusal to drink the Wine which the Prophet had set before them by God's command were transacted during the time of the Siege by  Nebu∣chadnezzar  for fear of whom the  Recha∣bites  had taken shelter in the City  In the ninth month  In manum Nebuchadnesaris tradidit Domi∣nus Jehoiakimum Regem Judae cum parte Instru∣mentorum Domûs Dei Dan i  mense videlicèt nono sive Cisleu  ut colligitur

had read  the Roll of Prophecy in the Temple which was in the seventh month Jeru∣salem was taken  Josephus  seems to have been desirous to conceal this fact from his  Gentile  Readers notwithstanding that the  Jews  held a solemn Fast in the  ninth month  in commemoration of this  National  Calamity in the fourth year of Jehoiakim for he mentions nothing of the Capture of Jerusalem but only informs us that in the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar and the eighth of Jehoiakim in which he makes a mistake of four years the Babylonian made war with great power demanding tribute of  Jehoiakim  or threatening to fight him and that the other fearing the threats of the Babylonian and purchasing peace with money paid him the tributes which he had demanded  for three years  Ant Jud Lib x c p But it plainly appears by the circumstances which attended that subjection of  Jehoiakim  to the  Babylonians  that Jerusalem  was then taken  for the Sacred Writings expressly testify that  Nebuchadnezzar  bound  JEHOI∣AKIM  in chains to carry him to Babylon  though he did not then carry him away and that he  carried of the Vessels    i e  part of the Vessels  of the House of the  LORD  to Babylon  compare Dan i with Chron xxxvi so that  the Temple  and consequently  the City  was certainly at that time in the Conqueror's power  And as a further token of  absolute conquest  the King of Babylon directed the Master of his Eunuchs to  bring of the Children of Israel  and OF THE KING'S SEED  and  OF THE PRINCES  Children in whom was no blemish but well favoured  Dan i whereby it is manifest that the Eunuch was to CHUSE  He  gave order to Ashpenaz the Master of his Eunuchs  that he should  MAKE CHOICE  out of the Children of the Royal Family  and of  the Nobility of the Land  Prideaux's Connect Part I p  out the most promising Children that could be found  of the Seed Royal  and  of the Nobility  amongst whom were  Daniel  and his Companions and send them to Babylon which could not have been done if  Jerusalem  had not then been  absolutely  in the hands of the Babylonian Conqueror  by Nebuchadnez∣zar  who bound  Jehoiakim  in setters to carry him to Babylon  Chron xxxvi  as I  before remarked but he did not then carry him away  Jehoiakimum catenis vincivit Nebuchadne∣sar ut abduceret eum Babyloniam Chron xxxvi sed pactis posteà conditionibus servitutis  domi eum reliquit

Nebuchadnezzar King of Baby∣lon came up and Jehoiakim  became his Servant  three years then he turned and rebelled against him  Kings xxiv  for the Babylonian Monarch contented himself with taking away the most promising Children of  the Royal Family  and of  the Nobility  from whence the first commencement of the seventy years Captivity is to be dated and also  some of the Instruments of the Temple  God having withheld him  from taking more  The reason of my speaking dubiously whether this was the fifth or sixth time that Jerusalem was taken since the promise to David is because I can∣not produce sufficient authorities to prove that it was taken when King  Manasseh was carried away captive by the King of Assyria  though it is very probable that the City was then also really taken because Manasseh after his restoration thought it necessary to build walls and add new fortifications to different parts of the City See Chron xxxiii  or rather per∣haps inclined him to leave the rest that the Service of the Temple might be still continued which it certainly was as well as the  National Laws and Customs  and also a  National  Prince  of the House of David  "upon  the Throne of David  " notwithstanding that the Government was then held under the authority of a  foreign Heathen Monarch  which was the fifth if not the sixth time  The reason of my speaking dubiously whether this was the fifth or sixth time that Jerusalem was taken since the promise to David is because I can∣not produce sufficient authorities to prove that it was taken when King  Manasseh was carried away

fortifications to different parts of the City See Chron xxxiii  that the like extraordinary circumstances were fulfilled since the promise was made to King David that his  House  and  Kingdom  should be  established  See Sam vii  In the  fifth  year of Jehoiakim tho' the  first  year of his Vassalage to Baby∣lon in the ninth month a Fast was proclaimed in remembrance of God's Judgements in the preceding year    in memoriam ut videtur  Urbis  eodem superioris anni mense  a caldaeis captae  Archbishop Usher ad A M Dean Prideaux says that the  Fast  was held on  the eighteenth day of the ninth month  and is still kept by the Jews He also supposed as well as Archbishop Usher that  the City was then taken by the Chaldaeans  but see his words at length  The great Fast of the Expiation wherein Baruch read the Roll as is above related was annually kept by the Jews on the tenth day of the month  Tizri  which answers to our  September  Immediately after that Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judaea and  having laid siege to Jerusalem made himself master of it in the ninth month  called  Cisleu  which answers to our  Novem∣ber on the eighteenth day of that month  for on that day is still kept by the Jews an annual Fast in com∣memoration of it even to this day and having then taken  Jehoiakim  prisoner he put him in chains to carry him to Babylon But he having humbled himself to King Nebuchadnezzar and submitted to become his Tributary and thereon sworn fealty to him he was again restored to his Kingdom  c  Connect Part I p  upon the Jewish Nation and on the  Fastday  Baruch read the Words of Je∣remiah  "in the ears of all the People"  who were assembled on this solemn occasion in the Temple and the Roll which contained the Prophecies being afterwards read also in the presence of King  Jehoiakim  was by his order cut to pieces and  burnt  after which  all the former words  that were in the first Roll  were again wrote by Baruch in another Roll with several tremen∣dous additions against the  Nation  The King of Babylon  shall  certainly  come and destroy this Land and shall cause to cease from thence Man and Beast  Jer xxxvi  as well as personally against the  King himself  Therefore thus saith the  LORD  of Jehoiakim King of Judah He shall have  NONE TO SIT UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID  and his  DEAD BODY  shall be  CAST OUT  in the Day to the Heat and in the Night to the Frost  Jer xxxvi The former part of this  Vengeance  was fulfilled in the Captivity of  Jehoiachin  the Son of  Jehoiakim  who with all his Fa∣mily was soon afterwards carried to Babylon and a younger Brother Zedekiah was set up instead of the Descendants of  Jehoiakim  and the latter part of this Prophecy concerning the DEAD BODY of  Jehoiakim  is to the same effect with that Prophecy repeated in the d  chapter  where it is said  He shall be buried  WITH THE BURIAL OF AN ASS  drawn and  CAST FORTH  beyond the Gates of Jerusalem  for this also it seems was literally fulfilled in due time which shall hereafter be shewn  The particulars of these  circumstances in the fifth of Jehoiakim are related in the th chapter of Jere∣miah from the th verse to the end  After Jehoiakim had served Nebu∣chadnezzar three years  then he turned and rebelled against him  Kings xxiv which must have been in the seventh year of his reign and from that time to the end of his reign the  Jewish Nation  was miserably harassed by Bands of Foreign Troops from seve∣ral  different Nations  And the Lord sent against him" Jehoiakim "Bands" or Troops  of the Chaldees and Bands of the Syrians and Bands of the Moabites and Bands of the Children of Ammon and sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the Word of the Lord which he spake by his Servants the Prophets Surely at the Commandment of the Lord came this upon  Judah  to remove them out of his sight for the sins of Manasseh according to all that he did and also for the innocent blood that he shed  c  Kings xxiv  then subject to the Dominion of  Nebuchadnezzar  which under the Providence of God were to execute  the Divine Vengeance  upon the Jewish Nation agreeable to the express terms of God's Covenant for having neglected  the Divine Law  the People being at that time notori∣ously  corrupt and wicked  but more particularly for having neglected those parts of  the Law  which are  eternal viz the eternal Laws of  JUDGEMENT or Justice  and  RIGHTEOUSNESS of which the Prophets were continually remind∣ing  themWe have no further infor∣mation from the sacred Text concerning the four remaining years of  Jehoiakim  's reign  For  "he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem"  Kings xxiii  only that he  slept with his Fathers  "It appears by this" says the learned Bishop Patrick  that  to sleep with one's Fathers  signifies no more than  to  DIE  as they did  For  Jehoiachim  was NOT  buried with them  NOR  died in his bed  but being taken by the  Chaldaeans  he died  as they led him out of  JERUSALEM and according to the Prophecy of Jeremiah xxii they cast him out of the Gates and he had burial of an Ass that is lay upon the ground unburied Abarbinel thinks  continues the Bishop  he  died in the way to Babylon  and his Body was left in the Highway without any care taken to inter it but it lay ex∣posed to the Sun by day and to the Frost by Night xxxvi Jerem  See on Kings xxiv  The worthy Prelate is certainly right concerning the expression  "to sleep with one's Fathers"  for that is always mentioned as a distinct thing from  the burial  of any one as for instance  AHAZ SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS  and they  BURIED  him in the City  even  in Jerusalem but they  BROUGHT HIM NOT  into the Sepulchres of  THE KINGS OF ISRAEL  c  Chron xxviii whereby the distinction above∣mentioned is rendered manifest It was the common method it seems of expressing the  death  not the  bu∣rial  of Princes among the Eastern Nations and even in  Morocco  where many Eastern Customs prevail it is necessary even to this day to use some circumlocu∣tion in expressing the  death  of any one as it would be esteemed a capital offence to say in the Emperor's pre∣sence  in direct terms  that any man was  dead  This I have been informed by a worthy friend of mine who has frequently conversed with the present Emperor of Morocco  But with respect to the  manner  of JEHOIAKIM'S  death  I must remark that neither the opinion of the learned Bishop  Patrick  quoted above nor what he has cited from  Abarbinel    viz  that  "he died in the way"  seem to agree with the most probable account of  God's Ven∣geance  upon that wicked Monarch  and that JEHOIA∣CHIN  his Son reigned in his stead  Kings xxiv But Josephus  In the eighth chapter of the tenth book of Jewish Antiquities speaking of  Jehoiakim  he says  P Orleans Edition  re∣lates  that Jehoiakim RECEIVED the King of the Babylonians who fought against him for being terrified by the predic∣tions of the Prophet he neither shut him out nor fought against him so that the Babylonian Conqueror entering the City slew all the flower of the Youth of Jerusalem together with King Je∣hoiakim whom he commanded  to be cast unburied without the walls    and that he also appointed  Jehoachim  his Son  i e  the Son of  Jehoiakim  King of the Country and of the City  This is certainly the most probable account of Jehoiakim's death for Dean Prideaux's account that  they took  him prisoner in some sally  Connections Part I p  be∣sides that it is  a mere supposition  does not afford so literal an accomplishment of Jeremiah's Prophecy as the account of Josephus because the words  drawn and cast forth beyond the Gates of Jeru∣salem  seem to imply that  Jehoiakim  's death should be  in Jerusalem  as Jose∣phus has represented it otherwise it could not well be said that he was  drawn and cast forth  BEYOND THE GATES  if he did not die WITHIN THE GATES  This second conquest of Jehoiakim by Nebuchadnezzar was the sixth if not the seventh time that  Jerusalem  was taken by  foreign Enemies  since the conditional promise was made to David concerning  the Establishment of his Throne  and the Exaltation of  Jehoiachin  by the  Authority of the Babylonian Conqueror was the  seventh Restoration  of  the House of David  to the  "Throne of David"  after being  as often  delivered into the hands of their Enemies for neglecting God's  Laws  whereby the immediate interposition of DIVINE PROVIDENCE in the direction of Human Affairs is unquestionably demonstrated But not∣withstanding these examples both of  God's Vengeance  and of his  Mercy  to∣wards  "the House of David"  the young King  Jehoiachin  is a name compounded of two words  Jehoiachin  or    signifying  Je∣hovah will prepare  or according to some  Domini Praeparatio  five  Domini Firmitas  See the Inter∣pretation of Names in the end of the sixth Volume of Bishop Walton's Polyglot Bible p A transposi∣tion of these two words placing the last first forms a name of the same import though of a very different sound    IchinJehov  or  JeXinJehov  and that such a transposition of the name was frequently used is apparent because from thence is derived  by abbreviation  another name of this Monarch by which he is sometimes mentioned  viz  Chron iii  "Jeconiah"  or  IconJah  having the same meaning with both the forementioned names though the learned Pasor in his Greek Lexicon of the New Testament renders it  "praeparatus a Domino"  which is more properly the meaning of  Coniah    or  ConJehov  the name by which the Prophet Jeremiah has distinguished the same Monarch in his d and th chapters as the characteristical letter of the future tense is omitted in the lastmentioned name  alias  Jeconiah  or  Coniah  very soon afterwards fell into all the wickedness of his Fathers and consequently was rejected by the GOD  of Israel  for the Monarch was speedily informed by the Prophet  Jeremiah  that God had determined to deliver him up into the hands of his Enemies and into the hands of  Bebuchadnezzar whose face he feared  As I live faith the Lord though Coniah the Son of  Jehoiakim  King of Judah were the Signet upon my Right Hand yet would I pluck thee thence and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand  of them whose face thou fearest  even into the hand of Nebuchad∣rezzar King of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans  c  Jer xxii This chap∣ter contains also several other Prophecies against the Sons and Successors of King Josiah in the exact order of their respective reigns just as the Prophet repeated them after they were fulfilled in his Remonstrance to King  Zedekiah  and his wicked Court though un∣doubtedly the Prophet had before declared them in due time whilst each of the said Monarchs remained upon  "the Throne of David"  but no other account remains of these particular Prophecies except in this d chapter which shall hereafter be proved I hope to be only an occasional  repetition  of them in the pre∣sence of  Zedekiah  though it seems  he  feared not  GOD for the Text informs us that  he did  EVIL  in the sight of the  LORD  according to all that his Father had done  Kings xxiv And then immediately follows the account of  God's Vengeance  against him  At that time  says the Text  the Servants of  Nebuchadnezzar  King of Babylon came up against  Jerusalem  and the City was besieged  The Siege here mentioned is erroneously cited by Dean Prideaux in his Connections Part I p as a transaction during the life of  Jehoiakim  whereas nothing can be more plain than the narrative of the Sacred Text wherein after the Historian has mentioned the commencement of  Jehoiachin  's alias  Coniah  's reign and his evil conduct he proceeds next in course to this account of the  Divine Vengeance  in the th verse which Dr Prideaux has applied to the reign of Jehoiakim and the Sacred Historian still continuing the account of that Siege in the following verses informs us in the th verse that JEHOIA∣CHIN expressly by name  King of Judah went out to the King of Babylon  he and his Mother  c  so that there is not the least ground for placing the Siege in the reign of Jehoiakim    Kings xxiv  This  Vengeance  must have followed very close upon the footsteps of this King's  Iniquity  for it seems  he reigned in Jerusalem  only  three months    "and ten days"  Compare Kings xxiv with Chron xxxvi  And when the year was expired King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon  Chron xxxvi That is Nebuchadnezzar first of all sent  his Servants viz  his Army against Jerusalem who besieged  the City as I have already related from  the second book of Kings    Dean Prideaux hoped to have solved the diffi∣culty occasioned by his  own error  mentioned in the preceding Note by asserting that the Siege in the reign of  Jehoiachin  was only  a continuation  of the former Siege in the reign of  Jehoiakim  for he says  After  Jehoiakim  's death the Servants of  Nebuchadnezzar  that is  says he  his Lieutenants and Gover∣nors of the Provinces that were under his subjection in those parts  still continued  says he  to block up  Jerusalem  c  Connect Part I p And he once more cites for his Authority  the very same Text  which he had before applied to the reign of  Jehoiakim  and though he adds also the verse which follows it as a further Authority  viz  Kings xxiv yet neither of these verses mention a word about  the supposed continuance of the Siege  from the reign of  Jehoi∣akim  to the end of  Jehoiachin  's reign neither can any  such continuance  be reasonably implied therein to autho∣rize such an assertion in short the whole error seems to have been occasioned by his adhering to his own  supposition  beforementioned  viz  that Jehoiakim was "  taken Prisoner in some Sally  IT MAY BE SUPPOSED" says he "  which he made upon them" c  Connect Part I p for which he has  not the least Authority  the  supposition  being on the contrary directly opposite to the testimony of  Josephus  before recited and con∣trary also to the necessary accomplishment of Jere∣miah's Prophecy against Jehoiakim which I hope has already been sufficiently demonstrated The Dean nevertheless persists in the same hypothesis also in page of the first part  but he  did not bring  Jehoiachin  to  Babylon  until he himself went also "against the City" see Kings xxiv and then the Text informs us  Jehoiachin the King of Judah went out to the King of Babylon he and his Mother and his Servants and his Princes and his Officers and the King of Baby∣lon took him in the eighth year of his reign  "That is" says Bishop Patrick  in the  eighth year  of Nebuchadnezzar's reign for he be∣gan to reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim  he should rather have said  in the latter end of the third year of Jehoiakim  though the first year of Nebuchadnezzar includes also the greatest part of the fourth year of Je∣hoiakim  who reigned seven more after that which was  or until  "the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar"  And he carried out thence all the Treasures of the House of the Lord and the Treasures of the King's House and cut in pieces all the Vessels of Gold which Solomon  King of Israel had made in the Tem∣ple of the Lord as the Lord had said And he carried away all  Jerasalem  and all the Princes and all the mighty Men of Valour even ten thousand Captives and all the Craftsmen and Smiths none remained save  the poorest sort  of  the People  of the Land  c  Kings xxiv  c  All these circum∣stances sufficiently prove that Nebu∣chadnezzar was now  a  THIRD  time Mas∣ter of Jerusalem  this being  the seventh  if not the eighth  time  that the City of  Jerusalem  fell into the hands of  foreign Enemies  since the conditional promise was made to King  David  of  an established Throne  but as JEHOIACHIN  forsook  the ways of GOD he was of course  forsaken  of GOD in his temporal Government and was given up to his Enemies with his  Mother  his  Wives  his  Officers  and  the Mighty of the Land  who were all carried away together  INTO CAPTI∣VITY  from Jerusalem to Babylon  Kings xxiv  c    and thereby afforded to all future  Admi∣nistrations  of  national Government  an awful example of the  Divine Vengeance  against  Kings  and  Rulers  that neglect  the eternal Laws of  GOD But though Nebuchad∣nezzar thought it necessary to depose  Jehoiachin  as well as his Father  Jehoi∣akim  before him yet he still persisted in maintaining "  the House of David  Ezek xvii  " upon  "the Throne of David"  and accord∣ingly  made  Mattaniah  his Father's Brother King in his stead and changed his name to  Zedekiah  Kings xxiv    This Monarch was the third of King  Josiah  's Sons  By  Hamutal the Daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah  Kings xxiv She was also the Mother of Jehoahaz or Shallum as he is called in Chron iii and in Jer xxii the immediate Successor of Josiah who was deposed and carried away by PharaohNechoh  Ibid  xxiii  that succeeded him upon  the  Throne of David  notwithstanding that the  Nation  had been  four times  conquered by foreign Enemies since Josiah's death But it is still more remarkable that both these foreign Conquerors Pha∣raohNeco and Nebuchadnezzar should not only persist in setting up the Princes of  "the House of David"  upon  the Throne of David  but should also remind them of their indispensible ob∣ligation to maintain the  Laws  and  Reli∣gion  of the GOD  of Israel  by putting upon them respectively a Memorial of the Sacred Name of JEHOVAH for I have already shewn that  PharaohNeco  gave the name of  Jehoiakim  signifying "JEHOVAH  will establish  " when he set up a Monarch over the peculiar People of JEHOVAH and now again Nebu∣chadnezzar not only obliged his new Vassal to "  swear by  GOD  Compare Chron xxxvi  viz    Ne∣buchadnezzar who had  made him swear  by God  with Ezek xvii  viz    and made a  Co∣venant with him  and hath  taken an Oath of him    that he  would observe the Covenant which was then made between them but he also put upon him a signal Memorial of the  Name  and peculiar  Principle  of the  only true  GOD JEHOVAH by giving him the Surname of  Zedekiah  Kings xxiv    TsadokJehov signifying  the Righte∣ousness of  JEHOVAH  or JEHOVAH  is "righteous"  whereby it is manifest as I have before remarked that the  Laws  and  Religion  of JEHOVAH were tolerated or continued among the Jews even by the Authority and avowed Con∣sent of the Heathen Conqueror himself which surely denotes that  he was guided in this matter by a very particu∣lar  PROVIDENCE for at the same time that he afforded the Jews an opportunity of retrieving their past conduct by ob∣serving more strictly  the Laws of God  and the forms of their own  National Re∣ligion  he set before them  in the Sur∣name of their new Monarch  the  Sum Essence  and  ultimate Purpose  of all true Religion  THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JEHOVAH  This was a Name therefore of such actual importance to the  Jewish State  though perhaps a common name even before that time among the  Jews  that it could not have occurred by the mere light of Nature to the  Babylonian Stranger  on the solemn occasion of  confirming and establishing a King of Judah  to which it was most particularly adapted for it was really the name as shall be more particularly shewn hereafter of that future "KING OF THE JEWS" in whom alone  the Throne of David  Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will raise  unto David a righteous Brauch  and a KING  shall reign and prosper  and  shall execute  JUDGE∣MENT AND JUSTICE  in the Earth  In his days Ju∣dah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and  this is his name  whereby he shall be called THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  Jer xxiii  i e  JehovahTsadecns  which is the same name only transposed with  Zedekiah  or  TsadekJehov  except that the former has the small addition of the possessive particle  sig∣nifying OUR  viz  JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS instead of THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JEHOVAH  could be  truly  and effectually "  established for ever  " This surely was far above the know∣ledge and comprehension of a  Heathen Stranger  unacquainted with the revealed Laws of God  It was also the name which of all others could best point out  to the Jews  the only certain method of  establishing the Throne of David  then newly restored and indeed of  establishing every other Throne  to the end of the World I mean a strict conformity to  the eternal Law of Righteousness    THE RIGH∣TEOUSNESS OF JEHOVAH  There was no other method of averting the  dreadful  Retribution  at that time fully due to the  Jewish Nation  that impend∣ing  Vengeance  and  Desolation  of which the Conqueror and present Restorer of the Kingdom was himself  the appointed Executioner  in case of  Disobedience  See how the  same means  of averting  God's Vengeance  has been since set before us even by THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HIMSELF as the  first principle  of sound policy  Seek ye  FIRST  the Kingdom of Gód and  HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS  and all these things  temporal necessaries "shall be added unto you" Mat vi But  Zedekiah  paid so little regard to  "the Righteousness of Jehovah"  and proved so notoriously unworthy to bear  that glorious name  that the Prophet  Je∣remiah  was very soon afterwards com∣manded to denounce  God's Vengeance  against him even in the beginning as it seems of his reign that is as the Text informs us  after that  NEBU∣CHADREZZAR  King of Babylon had carried away captive  JECONIAH  the Son of  JEHOIAKIM  King of Judah and  THE PRINCES  of Judah  c  The Revelation was made under the Type of a Basket of Evil Figs see the th chapter but as the Judgements therein contained are denounced not only against THE KING but also against  HIS PRINCES  and the Residue of Jeru∣salem  chap xxiv we may pre∣sume that this th chapter was not revealed till  Zedekiah  had so far settled himself in the Kingdom as to have  ap∣pointed  PRINCES  And as the  evil Figs  which cannot be eaten they are  so evil surely  thus saith the LORD So will I give  Zedekiah  the King of Judah and HIS PRINCES and the Residue of Jerusalem that re∣main in this Land and them that  dwell in the Land of Egypt  for many of the Jews had fled to Egypt for an Assylum  and I will deliver them to be re∣moved into all the Kingdoms of the Earth for  their  hurt  to be  a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither I shall drive them  c  Chap xxiv  and  other Officers  under him  because "ALL THE PRINCES" and  all Persons of any Distinction  "And he" Nebuchadnezzar  carried away  all Jerusalem  and ALL THE PRINCES and  all  the mighty Men of Valour even ten thousand Cap∣tives and  all  the Craftsmen and Smiths  none re∣mained  save the poorest sort of the People of the Land  King xxiv  in the former reign were carried into Captivity with their King  Jehoiachin  Kings xxiv and therefore though the severe sentence in the th chapter was denounced in the beginning of  Zedekiah  's reign yet undoubtedly he had already given sufficient proofs that his trust was  in Man  and not in GOD so that his condemnation was just About this time likewise the Prophecies contained in the th chap∣ter of  Jeremiah  were sent in a letter from the Prophet to the Captives at  Babylon  by the hands of the Ambassadors whom  Zedekiah  sent to the King of Babylon In the th verse of this chapter the  Prophet repeats a part of the th chap∣ter relating to the Type of  Evil Figs  which as well as the preamble of each proves that these two chapters were de∣livered about the same time The two next chapters  viz  xxx and xxxi seem also to follow very properly  I have before quoted the opinion of Archbishop  Usher  where he supposes these two chapters might  perhaps  be referred to the date of the th chapter but he afterwards with more certainty refers them to the time of the th chapter ad A M which is agreeable also to the opinion of Dr  Lightfoot  Harmony of the Old Test p    In the beginning  In principio regni Sedekiae Prophetia de Elamitis tùm subigendis tùm restaurandis à Jeremiâ prolata est Jer xlix  c  Ad A M p  also of Zede∣kiah's reign the Prophet  Jeremiah  de∣nounced God's  Vengeance  against  Elam  or Persia but promised at the same time a future Restoration See the th chapter of Jeremiah from the  th verse  The Word of the Lord that came to  Jere∣miah  the Prophet against ELAM  in the beginning of the reign of  ZEDEKIAH  King of Judah  saying Thus saith the LORD of Hosts  Jehovah of Armiss  "Behold I will break  the Bow of Elam" c  The Persians were always famous  Archers  as well as ex∣cellent Horsemen  Whether the  Judge∣ments  against Ammon Edom Damas∣cus  c  contained in the former part of this chapter were delivered also at the same time does not appear it is ra∣ther more probable that they were deli∣vered about the same time with the th and th chapters  viz  in the fourth year of Jehoiakim for which opinion I have already quoted the authority of the learned  Lightfoot  Some of these Nations were doomed to  temporal Ven∣geance  in the beginning of  Jehoiakim  's reign The Prophecy of this  Vengeance  contained in the th chapter of Jere∣miah was to be afterwards communi∣cated to them by their own Ambassa∣dors  in the reign of  Zedekiah  which could not be done till the latter end at least of his fourth year though the learned Archbishop of Armagh places that Revelation in the beginning of Zedekiah's reign See ad A M p  Regum Edomaeorum Moabitarum Ammo∣nitarum Tyri Sidonis Legatis Hierosolyma ad visitandum novum Regem Sedekiam venientibus DEUS Jeremiam Vincula Lora tradere  jubet  ad Dominos fuos perferenda  c  But the  Hebrew Text  declares that God gave  this charge  to  Jeremiah  in the beginning of  Jehoiakim  's reign which I hope I have already proved where I speak of that reign See also Dr Lightfoot on the th chapter of Jeremiah in his Harmony of the Old Testament p  The th and st chapters of Jere∣miah seem to come next in order of time They contain dreadful denunci∣ations of  God's Vengeance and Retribution  against  Babylon  the mighty Instrument of  God's Vengeance  of which I shall have occasion to say more hereafter  In the st chapter ver we read that  JEREMIAH  wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon  BABY∣LON  even all these words that are written against Babylon  which of course must include  both chapters  and we are enabled to ascertain the date of them by the preceding verse which together with the following verses in∣forms us that the Prince Seraiah was directed to read the said Prophecies at Babylon when he went there with ZE∣DEKIAH  in the fourth year of his reign  and was afterwards to cast the Book into the midst of the River  Euphrates  Jer li  There is no particular mention in Scripture of any transactions of  Zedekiah  between the fourth and ninth years of his reign only that  he rebelled against the King of Babylon in sending Ambas∣sadors into Egypt that they might give  him Horses and much People  so that he seems to have entertained a foolish and wicked desire to render himself  ab∣solute  and  independent  by means of a Standing Army of foreign Mercenaries for he not only endeavoured to procure Horses from Egypt but also  much People  Shall he prosper shall he escape that doth such  things  Ezek xvii    Ezek xvii And as he vainly put his whole trust in a  military Force  the  solemn Oath  which he had so lately taken was made to yield to his  poli∣tical views  though he had called GOD  to witness  So that the perjured Monarch's WILL AND PLEASURE was preferred to that RIGHTEOUSNESS in the execution of  Covenants  and  Laws  which  alone can establish the Thrones of Kings  Take away the  WICKED  from before the King and his Throne shall be  ESTABLISHED IN RIGHTE∣OUSNESS  Prov xxv  For the Throne is established by  RIGHTEOUSNESS  Chap xvi  "IN RIGHTEOUSNESS  shalt thou be  ESTABLISHED" Isaiah liv  And IN MERCY SHALL THE THRONE BE ESTAB∣LISHED  and he shall sit upon it  IN TRUTH  in the Tabernacle of David judging and seeking Judgement  or Justice "  and hasting  RIGHTEOUSNESS" Isaiah xvi The constant lesson of the Prophet Jeremiah to Zedekiah and the House of David was  Execute ye JUDGEMENT and RIGHTEOUSNESS  and deliver the Spoiled out of the hand of the OppressorDo  NO WRONG  do  NO VIOLENCE TO THE STRANGER  c  and  of which his new name Zedekiah or  Righteousness of Jehovah  was certainly intended to remind him This wicked policy was censured in the severest terms by the Prophet Ezekiel  Shall he prosper  said the Prophet  shall he escape that doth such things or shall he break the Covenant and be delivered As I live saith the LORD GOD surely in the place  where  the King  dwelleth  that made him King whose Oath he despised and whose Covenant he brake  even  with him in the midst of Babylon he  shall die Neither shall Pharaoh  For Pharaoh was also one of those mistaken Monarchs who placed his whole trust in Military Power and was censured also by the same Prophet for his folly and presumption  Thus saith the Lord God Be∣hold I  am  against thee Pharaoh King of Egypt the great Dragon that lieth in the midst of his Ri∣vers which hath said my River  is  mine own and I have made  it  for myself  But I will put my Hooks in thy Jaws  c  Ezek xxix  with  his  mighty Army and great Company make for him in the War by casting up Mounts and building Forts to cut off many persons See∣ing he despised THE OATH by  break∣ing the Covenant  when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these  things  he shall not escape Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD As I live surely mine Oath that he hath despised and my Covenant that he hath broken even it I will  recom∣pense  upon his own head And I will spread my Net upon him and he shall be taken in my Snare and I  will  bring him to Babylon  and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me And all  his Fugitives with all his Bands    viz  his Regiments or Mili∣tary Forces in which he trusted  shall fall by the Sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and  ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it  Ezek xvii Thus Zedekiah's Fate was appointed to be one of the many proofs which God vouchsafed to the Jews to demonstrate the Truth of his Revela∣tion by the Prophets  In the ninth year of Zedekiah the impending Vengeance became visible by the near approach of the Babylonian Army as I have before remarked in page for then began to be fulfilled what had been foretold not only in the fourth year of  Jehoiakim  but probably  also in the reign of Josiah Compare Jer i with xxv In the former God declares  I will call all the Fa∣milies of the Kingdoms of the North  c  and in the latter  Behold  I will send and take all the Families of the North  saith the Lord  thereby marking his absolute direction of them  and Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon MY SERVANT and will bring them  against this Land  c  And accordingly after Nebuchad∣nezzar had strengthened his Empire by reducing to his obedience all the King∣doms of the  Assyrian  as well as the  Syrian  Dominion which latter lay to  the North  of Judaea and extended quite up to  Armenia  the  Armenians  themselves being no other than  Syrians  for  Aram  is the proper name in Scripture for  Syria  he compelled the conquered Nations to assist him in reducing others to a like  servile subjection under his own arbitrary  Will  without perceiving that he and they  collectively  were but a mere in∣strument of  Vengeance  And thus was  NEBUCHADNEZZAR  raised up by God to be a  SCOURGE  compare this with what I have already remarked concerning that Monarch in pages and  TO ALL THE NATIONS ABOUT HIM  for the Punishment of their Sins  NE∣BUCHADNEZZAR had indeed OTHER THINGS IN HIS HEAD That which he designed was the gratifying his own Ambition and enlarging his Dominions but these were not the ends which God had to serve by him God made use of him as HIS INSTRUMENT as HIS SERVANT  for so he calls him for the rendering to the  NATIONS  that just  RE∣COMPENCE OF VENGEANCE  which their Sins called for I mention th  se things the rather because they are instances of God's dealing with Heathen Nations who were under no particular Covenant with God  Arch∣bishop Sharp's Sermons Vol I Serm intituled  Virtue and Religion the ONLY means to make a NATION prosperous  p th Edition  in the hands of  the Lord of Hosts  or  God of Armies  for we read in the th chapter of Je∣remiah that Nebuchadnezzar literally fulfilled the former Prophecies by com∣ing to fight against Jerusalem  with  all his Army and all the Kingdoms of the Earth of his Dominion  c  I have already related the Message which  Zedekiah  sent to the Prophet Jeremiah on this occasion with the Prophet's Answer which is the subject of the st chapter and that the Prophet was di∣rected also to repeat the Subject of that Answer in the presence of  Zedekiah  and  his whole Court  which leads me once more to the consideration of the d chapter the difficulty of which had obliged me to go back and investigate the Histories of the preceding Princes of Judah and of the Times when the se∣veral Prophecies against them by  Jere∣miah  were revealed and though this necessary digression has I fear been extended to a much greater length than is consistent with due order and method yet I trust my candid Readers will excuse this defect in mere matter of form if they should find any thing in  my digression that may tend to illus∣trate and render more familiar to the generality of Readers that excellent Book the Collection of  Jeremiah  's Pro∣phecies in which all Mankind are ma∣terially concerned and interested for the Certainty of  God's Vengeance  upon  wicked Nations  is unquestionably demon∣strated in the Prophecies of  Jeremiah  so that the Tenour of  that whole Book  indeed relates in some degree to my present subject though I had at first intended to confine myself in this Tract to the examination only of the st d and th chapters as being more particularly levelled against  Oppressors Tyrants  and  Slaveholders  Commentators have generally con∣ceived that the Divine Message re∣corded in the d chapter from the be∣ginning to the th verse at least was not delivered to  Zedekiah  but to  Jehoi∣akim  because a Prophecy against the latter is recorded in the th verse  viz  "Therefore" said the Prophet refer∣ring back to the Offences beforemen∣tioned  thus saith the Lord  CONCERN∣ING JEHOIAKIM  the Son of Josiah King of Judah They shall not lament for him saying Ah my Brother  c  He shall be buried with the burial of an Ass  c  But if we carefully examine the whole chapter with reference to the chapter which precedes as well as that which follows it will be found much more intelligible coherent and striking when the whole is considered as one conti∣nued Address to  Zedekiah  reminding him of the Judgements denounced and then indeed fulfilled against his im∣mediate Predecessors exactly according to the order of their reigns and ex∣pressly for the same Offences  viz  OP∣PRESSION  and  the Neglect of  JUSTICE  and  RIGHT for which he himself  by name  is condemned in the st chap∣ter The only difficulty which attends this construction is occasioned by the English Translators having used the  pre∣sent tense  in the th th and th verses where the  praeter tense  would certainly have been much more proper  viz  "Thus  saith  the Lord" instead of  Thus  said  the Lord to or concern∣ing  Jehoiakim  c  which latter is the literal construction of the original and is always so expressed in the inter∣lineary Latin Version of the London Polyglot  viz "Sic dixit Dominus"  for though in many other places it is indif∣ferent to the sense whether the  present  or  praeter tense  is used yet in these abovementioned it makes a very material dif∣ference because the Prophet is only re∣minding Zedekiah of the Prophecies which he had before denounced or at  least to the same effect against his dis∣obedient Predecessors as that for in∣stance against  Jehoiakim  was first deli∣vered by Baruch the Scribe though not exactly in the same words yet surely to the same purport in the presence of  Jehoiakim  himself after he had burnt the Roll of  Jeremiah  's Prophecies  viz  His dead Body shall be cast out in the Day to the Heat and in the Night to the Frost  Jer xxxvi which is the same thing in effect as to  be buried with the burial of an Ass drawn and cast forth  Jehoiakimus  à Chaldaeis captus abjectus fuit  insepultus  nempè  sepulturâ Asini sepultus  tractus projectus ultra portas Hierosolymorum juxta Prophetiam Jerem xxii xxxvi licèt ad communem Naturae Legem respectu habito dor∣mivisse dicatur ille cum Patribus suis Reg xxiv  Ad A M Though the learned Arch∣bishop in the above sentence supposes indeed that the quotation he there makes from  the d chapter  is really  a Prophecy  and not merely as I suppose the  Repetition of a Prophecy  yet it is plain that he esteemed it of the same import with the original Prophecy in the th chapter by his quoting them together in order to explain the one by the other    c  according to  the  repetition  of the Prophecy before Zedekiah as related in chap xxii  The Prophet in the beginning of the chapter is directed to  go down to the House of the King of Judah and speak  THERE  this Word and say Hear the Word of the Lord O King of Judah  THAT SITTEST UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID  c  Now the question is who was the Prince who then  sat upon the Throne of David  to whom the Divine Message was directed whether  Shallum Jehoiakim Jehoiachin  or  Ze∣dekiah  It could not be  Shallum  tho' he is the first mentioned therein be∣cause the Text describes him expressly as one  which  went sorth out of this place  being already carried into cap∣tivity  by  PharaohNecho  and the  Bur∣then  of the Prophecy against him was that "  he shall return no more" c  See the endings of all the three verses where∣in he is mentioned  viz  and which all  end with that Burthen  Again it is not likely that  Jehoiakim  who is mentioned next in order was  then the reigning Prince  because his Son and Successor  Jehoiachin  alias  Coniah  or  Jeconiah  is mentioned in the conti∣nuance of the fame Declaration in a much more conspicuous light than  Je∣hoiakim  himself being addressed in the second person as if present at the time of the Denunciation  viz  I will give  THEE  into the hand of them that seek  THY  Life  c  And I will cast  THEE  out  c  And though  Jehoiachin  probably was the reigning  Prince  upon the Throne when this severe Prophecy  against him was  first of all  denounced and also though he is expressly spoken of in the th verse as present  viz "This Man  CONIAH" yet he was not the Prince that  sat  upon the Throne of David  when Jeremiah repeated as I conceive  these several Prophecies  men∣tioned in the d chapter because the Prophet after a most solemn and alarm∣ing exclamation  O EARTH EARTH EARTH  hear the Word of the Lord  concludes his Message with a dreadful Sentence against a Prince whom he also calls  "this Man"  as if present  viz "Write ye  THIS MAN  childless  " which by no means agrees with the case either of  Jehoiakim  or  Coniah  The former cer∣tainly  was not childless  for besides his Son  Jehoiachin  or  Coniah  it is not im∣probable but that  Daniel and his fel∣lows  or at least some of them were also  the Children of  JEHOIAKIM for they were  OF THE KING'S SEED  AND OF THE PRINCES  Dan i that were carried to Babylon in the third year or rather the fourth year of  Jehoiakim  when that Monarch was twentyeight or twentynine years of age And it is as certain that  Coniah  or  Jehoiachin  was not  childless  because express mention is made of his  Seed  or Children in the th verse of this d chapter  viz  that  he and his  SEED  are cast into a Land that they know not  and no less than eight Sons of his are expressly mentioned in Chron iii  "  The Sons of  JECONIAH" the same with Co∣niah  Assir Salathiel his Son Malchiram  also and  Pedaiah  and  Shenazar Jecamiah Hoshama  and  Nedabiah  Chron iii  Neither did Coniah LOSE his Children during the Captivity as the learned Mr  Goadby  in hopes of re∣moving the difficulty has ventured to assert  "Write ye this Man childless"    That he had Children  says Mr  Goadby    appears from the th verse and therefore  this is a Prophecy  that he should  lose them during his Captivity  for he was so far from  LOSING his Children  during his Capti∣vity  that it is probable  they were most of them born during the Captivity  for he was but  eighteen years of age when he began to reign and he reigned in Jerusalem  ONLY  "three months"  Kings xxiv  "and ten days"  Chron xxxvi so that it is not easy to conceive that he could have so many as eight Children  before he was carried to Babylon  But the matter is put out of dispute by the Apostle MAT∣THEW who informs us  expressly  that  AFTER  they were brought to Babylon  JECHONIAS BEGAT  Salathiel and Salathiel begat Zorobabel  c  Mat i from whence a regular succession is continued for more than five hundred years down to  Joseph  the  Hushand  of the Blessed Virgin The Prophecy therefore of Jeremiah  Write ye this  Man childless  could not relate to  Coniah  nor to any other Prince of the House of David cotemporary with  Je∣remiah except  ZEDEKIAH ALONE and  in him  it was indeed  literally fulfilled  for  the King of Babylon slew the  SONS  of  ZEDEKIAH  in  RIBLAH  before his Eyes  Jer xxxix which clearly answers to the Prophecy  Write ye this Man  CHILDLESS  I have taken the more pains to explain this necessary application of the Prophecy because amongst the Commentators that have erroneously ap∣plied it to  Coniah  I have to oppose the weighty au∣thority of the very learned and worthy Archbishop of Armagh for whose testimony in general I have the highest esteem though here I am obliged to dis∣sent from him on account of the superior authority of the Text He says  "Contra hunc"  speaking of JEHOIACHIN  severissimum Dei Judicium denunciatum extat in fine capitis  xxii  Jeremiae sententiâ hac quasi in acta referendâ domum conclusum  SCRIBITE VI∣RUM HUNC LIBERIS CARENTEM VIRUM NON PROSPERATURUM IN DIEBUS SUIS NAM NON PROSPERABITUR DE SEMINE EJUS QUISQUAM SESSURUS IN SOLIO DAVIDIS ET DOMINATU∣RUS  AMPLIUS IN JUDA Jer xxii  Vide ad A M p This by no means agrees with the case of  Jehoiachin  but is perfectly answerable to that of  Zedeliah  who was not only rendered  childless  by the Sword but was also  "a man that" did  not prosper in his days  for he afterwards lingered out a miserable life BLIND and IN CHAINS  at Babylon  "Moreover"  says the Text  "be"  the King of Babylon  PUT OUT ZEDEKIAH'S EYES  and bound him with  CHAINS  to carry him to  BABYLON  Jer xxxix  whereas  Jehoiachin  who was carried into Captivity before him did after that time really  PROSPER IN HIS DAYS  for though he had done  evil in the sight of the Lord  for which he was removed as I have before remarked yet the great Searcher of Hearts perceived something in him worthy of the Divine Mercy as also in several others that were carried into Captivity at the same time which was declared very soon  after  the commencement of their punishment and a mitigation was then promised by the Prophet Jere∣miah under the type of  "a Basket of Good Figs"  see the th chapter whereas Zedekiah and those who remained with him were likened to  a Basket of Evil Figs  to which a heavy curse was annexed  perfectly  agreeable to the severe sentence in chap xxii which I have applied to  Zedekiah  and  as perfectly  un∣applicable to  Jehoiachin  The latter and those that  were carried away with him had an absolute promise of  Grace Peace  and  Prosperity  Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel  Like these GOOD FIGS so will I  acknowledge them that are carrted away Captive of Judah    viz Jeconiah  and the Princes of Judah with the Carpenters and Smiths that were carried with them see the first verse  whom I have sent out of this place into the Land of the Chaldaeans  FOR  their  GOOD  For I will set mine eyes upon them  FOR GOOD and I will bring them again to this Land and I will build them and not pull  them  down and I will plant them and not pluck  them  up  And I will  GIVE  them  AN HEART TO KNOW ME  that  I  am  THE LORD  and they shall be my People and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heart  Jer xxiv  that like the GOOD FIGS God would acknowledge them and set his eyes upon them FOR GOOD and would bring them again to their own Land that is some of them and their Descendants that he would build them and not pull them down  c  that he would  give them an heart to know him c  upon the whole that they were in the Land of the Chaldaeans FOR THEIR GOOD And accordingly the Scriptures hear a remarkable testimony concerning  THE GOOD  which God reserved for  Jehoiachin  IN THE LAND OF THE CHALDAEANS  So that he must necessarily be said to have  "prospered in his days"  for we read expressly that  EVILMERODACH  King of Babylon in the  first  year of his reign lifted up the head of  JEHOIACHIN  King of Judah and brought him out of prison and spake kindly unto him and  SET  HIS THRONE ABOVE THE THRONE OF THE KINGS THAT  were  WITH HIM IN BABYLON  so that of him who was thus set up as in the highest place of favour upon a Throne in the presence of the most powerful King at that time upon earth it could not he said that  "he did not prosper in his days"  espe∣cially as this extraordinary favour and  prosperity  lasted  all his days  for we read in the Text that  he did  CONTINUALLY  eat bread before him  the Baby∣lonian Monarch  ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE  And  for  his diet there was a  CONTINUAL DIET  given him of the King of Babylon every day a portion  UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE  Jer lii  Surely therefore it would be as improper to say of  this Man  JEHOIACHIN who had so great a share of PROSPERITY that  he did not prosper in his days  as to "  write him  CHILDLESS" who had so many CHILDREN and so long and compleat a succes∣sion of Descendants some of whom as  Salathiel  and  Zorobabel  were RULERS IN JUDAH though they  did not  "SIT UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID" The Prophecy therefore of these unhappy circumstances  the Deprivation of Children  and  Want of Prosperity  in the d chapter could not by any means relate to  Je∣hoiachin  or  his Descendants  and there was no other Monarch after him  "upon the Throne of David"  to whom it could be applied  except  ZEDEKIAH  alone    Now  as it is manifest that the last verse of the d chapter of Jeremiah was ad∣dressed  to  Zedekiah  it is equally mani∣fest that the beginning of it was also  to him  I have had the satisfaction to find since I wrote the above that the learned  Grotius  was also of the same opinion and that he also comfirms what I have suggested above concerning the  Repetition  of former Prophecies in the presence of King  Zedekiah  for in his Commentary on the beginning of the d chapter  "Haec dicit Dominus"  he thus expresses himself "  Haec  DIXIT" says he preferring the  praeter  to the  present  tense  JEREMIAS  enim Sedeciae loquens  SIMUL REPETIT QUAE REGIBUS ANTECE∣DETIBUS  fratriscilicet ipsius  SEDECUAEM  fratrisque filio  PRAEDIXERAT  ne quid haberent quod de tam gravi Dei ultione conquererentur  Annotata ad Vet Test Tom II p See also  Crituci Sacri  Tom IV P I find also that the Learned and Reverend Authors of the Commentary commonly called  As∣sembly's Annotation  have objected to this interpretation of  Grotius  for I suppose by their recital of  his Hypo∣thesis  that they mean him though they' have not mentioned his name but yet they have not ad∣vanced any sufficient arguments to confute his doc∣trine neither have they removed the obvious difficul∣ties which if I may judge of  Grotius  by myself oc∣casioned  that Hypothesis  and therefore I conclude that these difficulties cannot in any other way be so easily explained  for the first part of the Divine Message in the d  chapter is nearly a Repetition of the Answer which the Prophet had before returned by  Pashur  and  Zephaniah  the Messengers sent to him by King  Zede∣kiah  as mentioned in the preceding chapter which will clearly appear by the following collation  Part of the Answer of the Prophet Jeremiah sent to King  Zedekiah  by  Passur  and  Zephaniah  as recorded in the  st  chapter  And touching  THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH  say  HEAR YE THE WORD OF THE LORD O HOUSE OF DA∣VID  the Address to  the whole Gourt  inserted in the Remonstrance is here omitted because this was a Message only to  the House of David    thus saith the Lord EXE∣CUTE JUDGE∣MENT  in the Morning and  DELIVER  him that is  SPOILED OUT OF THE HAND OF THE OP∣PRESSOR  this ge∣neral term  the hand of  the Oppressor  necessa∣rily includes  Violence to the Stranger the Father∣less  c    lest my Fury go out like Fire and burn that none can quench  it because of the evil of your doings  Jer xxi  The first part of the Pro∣phet Jeremiah's perso∣nal Address to King  Zedekiah  recorded in the  d  chapter  HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O KING OF JUDAH THAT SITTEST UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID  thou and thy Servants and thy People that enter in by these gates Thus saith the Lord  EX∣ECUTE  ye  JUDGE∣MENT  and Righteous∣ness  AND DELIVER THE SPOILED OUT OF THE HAND OF THE OPPRESSOR  and do no Wrong do no Violence to the Stranger  the Fatherless and the Widow  c    But if ye will not hear these Words I swear by myself saith the  LORD  Jeho∣vah "that this House"  the Palace  shall become a Desolation  c  Jer xxii  The Prophet afterwards proceeds in the th th and th verses of his Remonstrance to the King and Court to declare the certainty of Desolation and  Vengeance  if they would not hear his words and in the th and th verses he assigns a general Reason  And many Nations shall pass by this City and they shall say every man to his neighbour Wherefore hath the  LORD  done thus unto this great City Then they shall answer Because they have forsaken the Cove∣nant of the  LORD  their  GOD  and worshipped other Gods and served them  Jer xxii Now probably  the British Slavedealer and British American Slaveholder  will be apt to argue from thence that the several examples of God's Vengeance upon the Jews which I have cited in this Tract have no rela∣tion  to the subject of difference between them and me We have not  "worshipped other Gods and served them"  perhaps they will say so that the account of  God's Vengeance  against  Jerusalem  which Granville Sharp has cited as a warning against  Slavedealing  and  Slaveholding  is not at all applicable to usBut let me as a Friend and Countryman warn all such persons that they have really  worshipped other Gods and served them  and have  broken the Christian Covenant  in as notorious and impious a manner as ever the an∣cient  Jews  did the Covenant of Sinai Respecting  the Breach of Covenant  I have wrote at large in another Tract now in the Press and shall therefore only offer at present a few hints respecting the horrid crime of  serving other Gods  Christ himself has taught us that  NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS  for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other  and then he immediately adds  "Ye cannot serve  GOD  and Mammon"  Mat vi and Luke xvi Here the  Service of Mammon  is placed in as direct opposition to the  Service of  GOD as ever was the Service of  Baal Moloch  or  Chemosh  though the first means not any particular  Idol  but only the baneful influence of  Riches  or the undue preva∣lence of  private interest  over all sense of Religion Jus∣tice and Virtue In like manner  Covetousness  which  includes all that I have said of  Mammon  is frequently mentioned in Scripture as downright  Idolatry  For this ye know  said the Apostle Paul to the Ephesians chap v  that no Whoremonger  nor  unclean per∣son  nor COVETOUS MAN WHO IS AN IDO∣LATER  hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God  And in the Epistle to the Co∣lossians the same Apostle warns us against some of the common Vices which draw down the Wrath of God  viz  Fornication Uncleanness inordinate Affection evil Concupiscence  and COVETOUSNESS  which is  IDOLATRY  Col iii  Neither is  Covetousness  the only Vice that is deemed  Idolatry  all the other Lusts and carnal Indulgences are equally ranked with  Idolatry  so that those in∣considerate persons who yield to any of them may as aptly be said to  "serve other Gods"  as those back∣sliding Professors of Christianity at  Philippi  whom the Apostle Paul expressly charged with this kind of  Idolatry viz "whose God is their Belly"    For many walk  says he  of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping  that they are  the  ENEMIES  of the Cross of  CHRIST  whose end  is  Destruction  WHOSE GOD is their BELLY  and  whose  Glory  is  in their Shame who mind earthly things  Philip iii And the  Service of  the Belly  Even the Schismatical Teachers of Novel Doctrines are rank∣ed with those  Idolaters  who  serve their own Belly  and serve not God    For they that are such  SERVE NOT  our Lord  JESUS CHRIST  but  THEIR OWN BELLY  and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple  Rom xvi  is placed in as direct opposition to  the Ser∣vice of Christ  as the  Service of the Pantheon  or  all the Heathen Deities  could be for it is as effectually  the Service of Devils  as the latter"  Whosoever commit∣eth  SIN  is the  SERVANT  of  SIN" John viii and if  "the Servant of Sin"  then also the  Servant of the Devil  for"  He that committeth  SIN said the same Apostle IS OF THE DEVIL" John iiiAnd though Men are not so lost to Common Sense in these more enlightened Days of  Christianity  as personally to worship at the Shrines of  Demons  or  Devils  yet they serve the  Devil  as  effectually as ever  to the Destruction of their own Souls by yielding to his temptations whether through  Mammon  or  Carnal Lust  For  Know ye not that the  UNRIGHTEOUS  shall  NOT IN∣HERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD  be not deceived neither Fornicators nor Idolaters nor Adulterers nor Effeminate nor Abusers of themselves with Mankind nor Thieves nor Covetous nor Drunkards nor Re∣vilers nor Extortioners shall  INHERIT THE KING∣DOM OF GOD  I Cor vi and  Thus it is clearly demonstrable I trust that Man∣kind may be guilty of  Idolatry  and of  serving Devils  without paying any personal Adoration to their  Idols  and on this I found my warning not only to  Slavedealers  and  Slaveholders  but also to my Countrymen  in general The dangerous prevalency of the  Devil  's Empire in these kingdoms through the  service  of  Mammon  and of  Carnal Lust  may be known by the following general Marks st By the shameful Spi∣rit of  Timeserving Venality  and  Private Interest  which is every where predominant to the destruction of  true Loyalty  and National Independence dly By the increased number of notorious  Gaming Houses  which are frequented by the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom for Days and Nights together dly By the multitudes of poor female  Prostitutes  which swarm in the publick Streets and also by the fre∣quency of Masquerades and Midnight Balls which apparently afford to the idle and vicious part of Man∣kind the most dangerous opportunities of triumphing over unwary virtue and of spreading the baneful taint of  Prostitution  amongst females of superior Rank where∣by many persons of Rank and figure in the gay World are become almost as notoriously  dedicated  as it were to  Venus  or the Assyrian Goddess  Mylitta  See Herodo∣tus Lib i p as ever the Heathens were of old But the greatest mark of  National Infamy  and of Satan's Empire amongst us and that indeed which at pre∣sent I am engaged more particularly to oppose is the shameful public encouragement given to the  African Slave Trade  wherein the Service of  Mammon  and of the  Devil  is rendered apparent by the  horrible destruc∣tion of the human Species  which it annually occasions A particular State of that Trade lies now before me whereby it appears that the  number of Negro Slaves  bartered for in one year  viz on the Coast of AFRICA  from Cape  BLANCO  to  RIO CONGO  a∣mounted to Souls whereof more than half viz were shipped on the account of British Merchants and on the account of British A∣mericans  By another State of this Trade in it appears that ships were sent from  Liverpool for    Bristol for    London for    Lancaster for       In all for  Souls  exclusive of those imported by British American and West Indian Traders  In some former years the Subjects of Great Britain seem to have had still a much greater proportion of this cursed Trade to answer for My worthy friend Mr Anthony Benezet in his  Histo∣rical Account of Guinea  c xiii p cites Anderson's History of Trade and Commerce to the following Effect viz  That Eng∣land supplies her American Colonies with Negro Slaves amount∣ing in Number to above  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVERY YEAR  which in that year were pro∣bably very considerable because in the following year several of the North American Provinces began to be alarmed for the  dangerous consequences  of tolerating such an  unchristian like practice  which Sen∣timent was fully expressed in some of their public Assemblies especially in those of  Virginia Pennsylva∣nia  and the  Jersies  which shall be shewn hereafter and I hope they have put a stop to this detestable practice time enough to avert  God's Vengeance  from  those Regions though they must take notice that their reformation is but half compleat and conse∣quently that they are still in danger whilst they per∣mit individuals to hold in perpetual  Bondage  See  the Vengeance of God  denounced by the Prophets  Isaiah  and  Jeremiah  against the mighty Babylonian Empire and it's Mo∣narch  "which opened not the House of his Prisoners"  Isa xiv but  oppressed  the Captives they had taken and  held them fast  THEY REFUSED TO LET THEM GO  Jer l  the poor African Captives already imported Now if we consider what  multitudes of men  must have been  killed  merely in the attempt to take so many wretch∣ed Captives for sale and again  what multitudes  out of so large a number would  die  as usual in their passage to the West Indies and America either of Grief and Despair or by being inhumanly stifled in the Holds of Ships besides the large proportion nearly one half that would  die  of the seasoning as it is called after their arrival in the planta∣tions and lastly that all the remainder of  this vast multitude of    miserable human beings  will probably be  worn out  by hard service and oppression in the space of about years or less according to the average rate of some calculations that have been published These considerations I say must needs inspire us with indignation and horror even though the evil at present is at a considerable dis∣tance from us  See the Appendix to my  Re∣presentation of the Injustice and Dangerous Ten∣dency of  Tolerating Slavery  c  Add to this Destruction the number of brave Sea∣men that are annually cut off either by the Rising of  the Negroes    A French Slaving Ship  having been surprized by an  insurrection of the Negroes  who MURDERED MOST PART OF THE CREW the Mate finding no possibility to escape the like fate had set fire to the Powderroom and blew up the Vessel with upwards of two hundred Slaves on board  Gazetteer April I have heard of many instances of the like disasters happening to Crews of  English Slaving Ships  and even one of my own Relations perished in the same unlawful Trade with the whole Ship's Crew  in the Slave Ships or by pestilential distempers caught from the poor Negroes confined in the holds of the said ships add also the number of free Negroes occasionally blown up    The Polly Captain Walsh a Ship belonging to Mr Adams struck on the Bar of Bonny this last year  the Book was printed in  and was soon after attacked by the Ne∣groes The Captain finding he could not save his Ship sent his Boat's Crew off shut himself up in his Cabin and when the King of Bonny and all his People were got on board to the amount of  fifteen hundred and upwards  set fire to the Pow∣der and Sampson like at his death punished the treachery of his Assailants  Treatise upon the Trade from Great Bri∣tain to Africa by an African Merchant Appendix F p A deplorable  Hardness of Heart  seems to have possessed this Afri∣can Merchant for it appears by his manner of relating the above Story that he approved of Captain Walsh's  diabolical  deed and esteemed it rather as an act of  Heroism  and otherwise murdered and destroyed by the inhuman Commanders of these  SlaveShips  as well as by the arbitrary Go∣vernors on the  SlaveCoasts  In the year Mr Grosile  burned the Town of An∣namaboe and killed three or four of the Townspeople  Ibid  p  and likewise the num∣ber of poor wretches annually sent out by the African  Company as  Soldiers  who miserably perish in their settlements    The POOR WRETCHES sent out by the Committee have nothing on earth to support or comfort them in sickness or health but a rasher of salt beef stinking NewEngland rum and Portuguese Tobacco by which means FORTY SOLDIERS have perished at Cape Coast out of FORTYEIGHT from March the st to the th of May all of whom came out in the Jamaica Storeship about the middle of last February  African Merchant Appendix p  and to compleat this list of  Diabolical  Admitting the  AFRICAN TRADE  to be ever so  DIABO∣LICAL  says a Writer under the Signature of  "A Planter"  quoted by the said  African Merchant  Appendix C p  or the means by which the Negro's Body was first obtained ever so  UNFAIR no blame can deservedly rest on the Planter who is  ignorant of the means  and  innocent  says he  of the Guilt  But now even supposing the Body of the Negro to have been obtained in whatever manner the Planter may esteem the  most fair  which the  Planter  will probably alledge to be that the Negro was  a convicted Criminal  in his native country yet this Criminal never offended the Planter nor the Laws of the Planter's Nation  nor the "King Lords and Commons"  who  "have shared"  as he says  "in the Profits"  of the Slave Trade so that neither the Planter nor any of his Abettors can have any just right to continue the punishment of an offence committed in another country especially as neither he nor they can possibly know whether or not the Negro was really guilty and therefore  admitting the African Trade to be ever so  DIABOLICAL  or the means by which the Negro's Body was first obtained ever so  UNFAIR  the Planter though he only buys and retains the Slave must share the heavy load of Guilt with the  diabolical Kid∣nnapper  because he has  encouraged  the Oppression by  his Purchase  and  continues it  by his  Slaveholding  Wickedness add the horrid carnage and bloodshed that has frequently been occasioned by the Insurrec∣tions  of Slaves and the more horrible punishments that have been inflicted on the poor wretched Slaves to deter them from such attempt  From the Wokingham Journal of the th of April  The following is an extract of a letter of the th of Novem∣ber from one of the Hon  Council Board of Tobago  A con∣spiracy of Coromantees has kept us in continual alarm these days past Thank God it is now quite over as most of them are either KILLED HANGED BURNT or TAKEN I had four out who lay down near Rockleybay CUT ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS and DIED MUTUALLY IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS  The following paragraph was also taken from one of the pub∣lic newspapers about the same time  Extract of a letter from Jamaica Jan  The only thing that has occurred liere worth writing to you since my last is a plot that has been for some time formed among the Negroes to poison every white person in the coun∣try this hellish plot was luckily discovered before put into execution and for which we ought to be thankful to God We are now daily taking up the principal negroes of the diffe∣rent gangs some of the are HANGED some BURNT and others BEHEADED after being first STRANGLED Their HEADS ARE FIXED ON POLES ALONG THE HIGH ROADS as a warning to the rest  A Friend of mine assured me that he was present some years ago at one of these horrid executions when a poor negro man was absolutely BURNT ALIVE The unfortunate man was fastened down to the ground with forked sticks drove into the earth and sire was placed at his feet and was gradually removed nearer to the vital parts as the limbs were consumed The poor fellow bore the exquisite Torture without the least complaint looking great part of the time on those who stood near him with a sullen contempt  In short if the  destruction of the Human Species which is annually occasioned by this Cursed Trade was to be fully and fairly estimated it would appear enormous and shock∣ing it would appear that many more unfortunate  human beings  are annually SACRIFICED to MAMMON in the consequences of that iniquitous trade than were ever offered up by the  Philistines  and other de∣luded votaries of  Baal Moloch Hercules  c So that the HUMAN SACRIFICES  offered up to  MAMMON  by the  BRITISH NATION are undoubtedly more grateful to SATAN than those of the ancient Heathens because they are more numerousmore banefully destructive to the Human Species How then if all these points be considered shall our wretched  Slavedealers  and  Slaveholders  persuade the world and themselves that  they have not broken the Covenant and served other Gods  for the promised Desolation of Jeru∣salem  In the th verse the Prophet begins to recite several Predictions with which  he had formerly been charged against  Zedekiah's Brothers and Predecessors  who had been successively deprived of  their  Royal Dignity  and were carried  away  in chains  before him into a slayish  Captivity as I have before remarked  But the hopeless SLAVERY of his  Brother SHALLUM  SHALLUM alias JEHOAHAZ See Chron xxxvi who was  deposed put in bonds and carried away Captive  by PHARAOH NECHO into Egypt Compare Kings xxiii c  in particular as well as the principal cause of it the Prophet represented to him in very striking terms  Weep ye not for the Dead  says he meaning JOSIAH  neither bemoan him  The Prophet here refers to the long mourning and lamentations which were continued for many years in remembrance of the death of the great and good King JOSIAH the Father of SHALLUM as well as of ZEDEKIAH himselfSee Chron xxxv  And all Judah and Jerusalem  MOURNED  for Josiah and Jeremiah  LAMENTED  for  JOSIAH  and all the singingmen and the singingwomen  the min∣strells of those ancient days  spake of  JOSIAH  in their  LAMENTATIONS TO THIS DAY  and made them  AN ORDINANCE IN ISRAEL  and behold they are written in the  LAMENTATIONS    but  weep sore for him that  GOETH AWAY  for  HE SHALL RETURN NO MORE NOR SEE HIS NATIVE COUN∣TRY  For thus saith the Lord touch∣ing  SHALLUM  the Son of  JOSIAH  King of Judah which reigned instead of  JOSIAH  his Father which went forth out of this place  HE SHALL NOT RETURN THITHER  any more but he shall  DIE  in the place whither they have  LED HIM CAPTIVE  and shall see this Land no more  And then the Pro∣phet immediately refers us to the prin∣cipal Causes of God's Severity against the Royal House  "Wo unto him"  says he  that buildeth his House by  UNRIGHTEOUSNESS  and his Cham∣bers by  WRONG that USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK  a clear description of the abominable wickedness of Slavery  that saith I will build me a wide House and large Chambers and cutteth him out Windows and  it is  cieled with Ce∣dar and painted with Vermilion  For the Monarch but  whether  SHALLUM or JEHOIAKIM  is not clearly declared  Commentators in general have supposed that the Oppression and Injustice of JEHOIAKIM is here referred to by the Prophet but as SHALLUM also  "did Evil in the fight of the Lord"  Kings xxiii it is not improbable that  both  these monarchs might have been guilty of  similar Oppression  and that the Crime of  Shallum  might have been thus repre∣sented to  Jehoiakim  as a warning to  himself  when this prophecy was  first of all  delivered soon after  Shal∣lum  was carried into captivity nevertheless it is only introduced in this d Chapter  as a reproach  made in the presence of  Zedekiah  which I hope I have al∣ready proved  was more careful it seems to display  all the Elegances and Ornaments of  Architecture and the other polite Arts  in sumptuous Buildings  c  than he was to maintain the Laws of Equity and  Natural Right  but the Prophet adds  SHALT THOU REIGN  because thou closest  thyself  in Cedar Did not thy Father eat and drink and  DO JUDGE∣MENT  and  JUSTICE and THEN it was  well with him  But  no longer  for as soon as  Josiah  had un∣dertaken an  unjust war  against Pharaoh Necho who previously warned him of the folly and injustice of it God gave  him and his people  who were wicked enough to concur with him in his unlawful enterprize into the hands of their enemies upon the very first encoun∣ter See the text at large  Necho King of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphra∣tes  then probably belonging to the Assyrian empire "and Josiah went out against him But he"  Necho  sent Ambassadors to him saying What have I  to do with thee  thou King of Judah  I come not against thee this day but against  the house where∣with I have war for God commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me  that he destroy thee not  Ne∣vertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo And the archers shot at King Josiah and the King said to his servants Have me away for I am sore wounded His servants there∣fore took him out of that chariot and put him into the second chariot that he had and they brought him to Jerusalem and  he died  and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers  Chron xxxv to See also Esdras i c This judgement against Josiah for  undertaking an unjust war  is the more remarkable because God had pro∣mised him by Huldah the Prophetess that he  should be gathered to his grave in peace  c Chron xxxiv but the promise was plainly conditional God does not deprive men of their  free will  Josiah had it absolutely in his own power to have availed himself of the promise by persisting  in Righteousness  God did not bring the evil upon him nothing but his own  Royal will and pleasure  in commencing an  unjust war  against which he was even expressly warn∣ed  The promise however through the mercy of God may nevertheless be said to have been fulfilled For when Josiah was worsted before Necho the con∣queror did not pursue his advantage over the wound∣ed monarch to prevent his escape from the field of battle as might  naturally  have been expected on such an occasion nor continued the war till more than three months afterwards which circumstance may certainly be esteemed providential so that Jo∣siah was carried to Jerusalem and may truly be said to have died in peace surrounded by his friends and was buried with the most solemn Royal Pomp in the sepulchre of his fathers    He judged the Cause of the Poor and Needy then  it was  well  with him was  not this to know me saith the Lord But thine Eyes and thine Heart are not  but for Covetousness and for to shed in∣nocent Blood and for  OPPRESSION  and for  VIOLENCE  to do  it  There∣fore  that is for all these aggra∣vating circumstances of Tyranny  thus  SAID  the  LORD  concerning Jehoiakim the Son of Josiah King of Judah  and not  thus saith  for the present tense is not proper in this place  they shall  NOT LAMENT  for him saying Ah my Brother or Ah Sister they shall not lament for him  saying  Ah Lord or Ah  HIS  Glory  according to the general Lamentations that had been  made for his Father JOSIAH but on the contrary  he shall be buried with the burial of an Ass drawn and cast forth beyond the Gates of Jerusa∣lem  Concerning the completion of this prophecy see pages    c  Next in order after a short personal Address to the Nation concerning the  Certainty of God's Ven∣geance  and the Destruction of her  Pas∣tors  and  Lovers  the Prophet repeats the Judgement that had before been denounced against CONIAH the Son of JEHOIAKIM and Nephew as well as  Predecessor  to ZEDEKIAH the reign∣ing Monarch when this Remonstrance was made"  As I live  SAID" and not  saith    the Lord though  CONIAH  the Son of  JEHOIAKIM  King of Ju∣dah were the Signet upon my Right Hand yet would I pluck thee thence and I will give thee into the hand of them that seck thy life and into the  hand  of them  whose face thou fearest even into the hand of  NEBUCHADREZ∣ZAR  King of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldaeans And I will cast thee out and thy Mother that bare thee into another Country where ye were not born and there shall ye die But the Land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return  The Prophet then probably appealed to ZEDEKIAH concerning the unhappy fate of the person whose Sentence of Condemnation he had just been repeat∣ing "  Is this Man  CONIAH" says he  a despised broken Idol  Is he  a Vessel wherein  is  no Pleasure  WHEREFORE ARE THEY CAST OUT HE  and  HIS SEED  and  ARE CAST  The Prophet speaks of CONIAH as already  "cast outwherefore are they cast out"  so that it is manifest he could not be upon  the Throne of Da∣vid  when this remonstrance was made and conse∣quently none but  Zedekiah  could then be the reign∣ing monarch  into a  Land which they know not  for he plainly speaks of their being  cast out  as  an event already past  wherefore are they cast out  c  And if we con∣sider the question as being put to ZEDE∣KIAH the then reigning Monarch it contains great severity for if ZEDE∣KIAH had consideration enough left to reflect  wherefore  CONIAH  and his Seed were cast out  he must necessarily be struck with the Justice of his own Condemnation which the Prophet was about to pronounce with a most awful and alarming introduction  O Earth Earth Earth Hear the Word of the Lord Thus saith the Lord  WRITE YE THIS MAN CHILD∣LESS  a Man  that  shall not prosper in his days for no Man of his Seed shall prosper  SITTING UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID  and ruling any more in  JUDAH  Had Zedekiah been much more aban∣doned than he really was yet these dreadful Judgements so solemnly pro∣nounced in his own House or  Palace  and even before the  whole Court  could not well have failed to affect him for the present The following chapter seems likewise to have been delivered at the same time in the presence of ZEDE∣KIAH  and his whole Court  and was probably a part of the  Remonstrance  Though the learned Archbishop Usher attri∣butes to the d Chapter a different date from that which I suppose to be the true one and applies the severe sentence at the latter end of it viz  Write ye this Man childish  to JEHOIACHIN which I hope I have already proved to be applicable to none but ZE∣DEKIAH yet he was convinced that the following Chapter was delivered at the same time with the d  Hoc  tempore sequentis quoque capitis xxiii JERE∣MIAE prophetia edita fuisse videtur Ad A M p  for after declaring "Wo" to the wicked "PASTORS  Wo  be unto the  PASTORS  that destroy and scatter the sheep of my Pasture saith the  LORD  There∣fore thus saith the  LORD GOD OF ISRAEL  against the Pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold I will  VISIT  upon you  THE EVIL OF YOUR DOINGS  saith the Lord  c Jer xxiii This should teach Princes the extreme danger of ar∣bitrary modes of Government and that when they presume to rule by the indirect means of  Bribery and Corruption  or by open  Military Force  and  Standing armies  instead of LAW and NATIONAL RIGHT or agreeable to the scripture phrase instead of JUDGE∣MENT and RIGHTEOUSNESS they may too truly be said to  destroy and scatter the sheep of God's pas∣ture  and consequently may expect the same con∣demnation viz that the LORD  will  VISIT  upon them  THE EVIL  of  THEIR DOINGS  " probably meaning  the WRETCHED KINGS  "PASTORS" says the learned Dr Lowth in his commentary on this text  comprehend both  CIVIL and ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNORS  Aut potius  says the learned Michaelis  set Sehm qui priorem hujus cap partem a  v  praecedenti vaticinio contra Reges

which indeed he attributes a different date to that which I suppose to be the true one he adds  Ei vero connexum est sequens  c xxiii  quippe quod itidem directum est contra malos pastores  SEU REGES V  contra quos  c xxii  before∣mentioned  of  the House of David  who had neglected to EXECUTE JUDGEMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS and to RELIEVE THE OPPRESSED Jeremiah takes occa∣sion prophetically to draw

like a  SHEPHERD" c Isaiah xl The Shepherd here mentioned is THE LORD GOD or the LORD JEHOVAH  spoken of in the preceding verse whose  re∣ward was with him and his work before him  that is when he came into the world in a  visible  form  whom God would afterwards raise up even from the same Stock  the House of Da∣vid  to  EXECUTE JUDGEMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS  in the Land  com∣pare Jer xxxiii with ch xxiii and this is expressed in such opposite terms to the character of the reigning Prince ZEDEKIAH then doomed to de∣struction that a contrasted allusion  seems very clearly to have been in∣tended  Behold the days come saith the  LORD  JEHOVAH  that I will raise unto David  A RIGHTEOUS BRANCH  whereas the Royal Branch that had just been condemned in the preceding chapter was most UNRIGHTEOUS  and a  KING  shall  REIGN  and  PRO∣SPER  whereas the former wretched  Kings  were pulled down from their Thrones and carried into Captivity for the Neglect of  Justice  and  Right  but the promised King  shall  EXE∣CUTE JUDGEMENT AND JUSTICE  in the Earth  which was the  constant  Lesson  The necessity of maintaining JUSTICE and RICHTEOUSNESS  in political Government  as well as in  private life  is so clearly laid down in the Holy Scriptures that one would think it impossible that so many people who profess to believe the revealed word of God should nevertheless suffer themselves to be deluded by the sophistical arguments of those unbe∣lievers who assert that  Vices  are  necessary to render a state great and flourishing  and that  political Govern∣ment cannot well be carried on without sometimes doing  EVIL  that  GOOD  may come  But these notions are so far from being true that the contrary is clearly de∣monstrable  "Name any nation"  says an accurate and careful observer of the several histories of man∣kind  that was ever remarkable for  JUSTICE  for  TEMPERANCE  and  SEVERITY  of  MANNERS  for  PIETY  and  RELIGION  though it was in a wrang way that did not always thrive and grow great in the world and that did not always enjoy a plentiful portion of all those things which are accounted to make a nation happy and flourishing And on the other side when that nation has declined from its former virtue and grown impious and dissolute in manners we appeal to experience whether it has not likewise  ALWAYS  proportionably sunk in its success and good for∣tunes  Archbishop Sharp's Sermons Vol th Serm intitled  Virtue and Religion the only Means to make a Nation prosperous  which was preached before the House of Commons May p th Ed  indeed to ZEDEKIAH  and his Brothers  c  and was as  con∣stantly  by them neglected  In his days"  continues the Prophet  Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely  whereas under Zedekiah their Desola∣tion was compleated  and this is his  Name whereby he shall be called The Lord our Righteousness  i e  Jehovah Tsadekn{ou}  which is the Name of  Zedekiah  or  TsadekJehov  transposed with the small addition of the Pronomi∣nal Termination  n{ou}  for OUR  viz Jeho∣vahTsadekn{ou}  instead of  TsadekJehov  the latter signifying  Jehovah is righ∣teous  for this name was put upon  Zedekiah  by the Babylonian Conqueror to remind him of the solemn Oath he had taken  in the Name of God  This manifest contrasted allusion to  Zedekiah  makes it seem very probable that the Prophecies of this d chapter were also pronounced in the presence of ZEDEKIAH  and his Court  at the same time that Jeremiah went  down to the House  of the King of Judah  to de∣clare the solemn  Message  or  Remon∣strance  contained in the d chap∣ter  The learned Grotius indeed conceived that the message may be extended  even to the th Chap∣ter  "Haec Omnia"  says he speaking of the Prophecies of Je∣remiah from the words VAE PASTORIBUS in the d Chapter to the th Chapter inclusive  USQUE AD CAPUT  commemo∣rationem continent ab Jeremia factam apud Sedeciam de sermonil us  ANTE SEDECIAE  tempora diversis locis ac temporibus a se ha∣bitis ac congruentibus cum iis qua nunc  SEDECIAE  dicere coepe∣ral ut Dei in decretis suis et  AEQUITAS  et Constantia magis apparent ut jam aliquoties diximus  Crit Sacr Tom p  but I am thoroughly convinced that it cannot with propriety be extended beyond this d Chapter because the prophecies in the following Chapter the th under the type of two Baskets of Figs were de∣livered as the Prophet himself informs us  AFTER  that  NEBUCHADREZZAR  King of Babylon had car∣ried away Captive  JECONIAH  the son of  JEHOIAKIM  King of Judah with the Carpenters  c  and had brought them to Babylon  that isSOON AFTER the said remarkable period or else the mentioning that public calamity as a chronological circumstance to mark the time for that is the apparent purpose of it would have been nugatory and consequently we may be assured that the prophecies in the th Chap∣ter were declared in the very  beginning  of ZEDE∣KIAH'S  Reign  whereas the st and d Chapters and probably the d also were not revealed 'till the siege was begun as I have already shewn that is not 'till the th year of that Monarch The dates likewise of the Prophecies in several of the following Chapters are also exactly noted in the text to be dif∣ferent from the time supposed by  Gratius  as for in∣stance A  prior date  is expressly assigned to the th Chapterit being intituled  The word that came to Jenemiah concerning all the people of Judah in the th  YEAR  of  JEHOIAKIM  the son of Josiah King of Ju∣dah that was  THE FIRST YEAR OF NEBUCHAD∣REZZAR  King of Babylon  And again the two next Chapters viz  the th and part of the th  though  posterior  with refpect to the order of the Book have exact dates assigned them which are  prior  even to the th and th Chapters for they are expressly declared to have been revealed  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim  c The remainder of the th Chapter from the th Verse which the Prophet addressed to  Zedekiah  is as clearly to be attributed to the  beginning of  ZEDEKIAH  's reign  because the cir∣cumstances related in the following Chapter the th are expressly said to have come  to pass  THE SAME YEAR  in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah  and the Letter of Jeremiah to the Captives at Baby∣lon contained  in the th Chapter  is as clearly declar∣ed to have been wrote  after that  JECONIAH  the King  c  were departed from Jerusalem  which was also "  the beginning of the reign of  ZEDEKIAH" for the Letters were sent by ZEDEKIAH's Messengers See the d Verse So that the last mentioned supposition of the learned Grotius cannot be true  It was probably on the first approach of the Babylonian Army    viz  in the ninth year of Zedekiah that the Monarch sent Messengers to  consult the Prophet and thereby occa∣sioned this public Remonstrance  The War was immediately carried on with Vigour it seems in every part of the Kingdom see the th chap∣ter  The word which came unto  JEREMIAH  from the  LORD  when  NEBUCHADNEZZAR  King of Ba∣bylon  and ALL  his army  and ALL  the Kingdoms of the Earth of his Dominion  and ALL  the people  FOUGHT  against Ferusalem  and  against  ALL  the Cities thereof  Jer xxiv iSo that a general Attack seems to have been made at once in every part  and after some considerable progress had been made in it ALL THE FENCED CITIES BEING TAKEN except THREE see the th verse the Prophet received a further Command from God relating to King ZEDEKIAH  saying Thus saith the LORD    i e  JEHO∣VAH  THE GOD OF ISRAEL  Go and speak to  ZEDEKIAH  King of Judah and tell him Thus saith the  LORD  Behold I will give this City into the  hand of the  KING OF BABYLON  and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt  SURELY BE TAKEN  and delivered into his hand and  THINE EYES SHALL BEHOLD THE EYES OF THE KING OF BABYLON  and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth  that is when the King of Babylon was to sit in Judge∣ment upon him  and thou shalt go to Babylon  c  The Prophet however added a few words of comfort    yet hear the word of the Lord O Zedekiah King of Judah Thus saith the Lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword  but  thou shalt die in peace  that is a natural death  and with the burnings of thy Fathers the former Kings which were be∣fore thee so shall they burn  odours  for thee and they will lament thee  i e the Jewish nation in Captivity will lament thee  saying Ah Lord for I have pronounced the word saith the  LORD  Then  JEREMIAH  the Prophet spake all these words unto  ZEDEKIAH  King of Judah in Ferusalem when the King of Babylon's Army fought against Jerusalem and against all the Cities of Judah that were left against Lachish and against Azokah for these de∣fenced Cities remained of the Cities of Judah  Verses to  These repeated Denunciations of Ven∣geance with the HORRORS of the grow∣ing dangers from the successful Enemy before their eyes every way round Jeru∣salem at length so far shook the firm∣ness of that stubborn Monarch that he began to shew some signs of Remorse and as I have already shewn that THE OPPRESSION OF THE POOR was one of the principal causes though there were many others also assigned by the AL∣MIGHTY for casting off his People and sending them into CAPTIVITY  punish∣ing  TYRANNY  with  SLAVERY so even this wicked Monarch ZEDEKIAH who never thought of LAW or JUSTICE  in his Prosperity  was now it seems be∣come sensible that a public act of JUS∣TICE and MERCY towards the oppressed Poor that were then detained by his opulent Subjects in a miserable INVO∣LUNTARY SERVITUDE would be the most grateful act of Reformation and  the most acceptable Sacrifice in the sight of a merciful God and consequently the most effectual means to avert the NATIONAL DESTRUCTION which was then advancing with dreadful strides And accordingly we find that he actu∣ally prevailed  The Text informs us  that the King  ZEDE∣KIAH  had made a covenant with all the People which were at Jerusalem to  PROCLAIM LIBERTY  unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an Hebrew or He∣brewess  GO FREE  that none should  SERVE  him∣self of them  to wit  "of a Jew his Brother"  And it is probable that this was the  King's own proposal  though perhaps at the suggestion of the PROPHET to  fulfil the Law  because in the following verse it is said that ALL THE PRINCES  and  ALL THE PEOPLE HEARD  that they should let their manservant c  GO FREE  they  OBEYEDand these terms  hearing and obeying  seem to imply that neither the  Princes nor the People  were the proposers of the equitable mensure  "Now"  says the Text  when  ALL  the Princes and  ALL  the People which had entered into the Covenant  HEARD  that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant  GO FREE  that none should serve themselves of them any more then  THEY OBEY∣ED  and  LET THEM GO  Chap xxxiv to  upon his Princes and People to PROCLAIM LIBERTY  to  their  POOR BRETHREN IN BONDAGE and this Proclamation of LIBERTY was a public Act of the State  "COMMUNI DECRETO" says Grotius upon the place  statuerat impleri quod lex jubebat sed Judaei non observaverant  Vide Exod xxi Deut xv  for not only the King but  all the Princes  and  all the People  bound themselves in a most solemn covenant to comply with the terms of the Proclamation  Viz  That every man should let his man∣servant and every man his maidservant being an Hebrew or Hebrewess  go free  c th verse  which was also agreeable to an ancient Ordinance of their Law  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and  PROCLAIM LIBERTY  throughout  all  the Land unto  ALL THE INHABITANTS  thereof it shall be a Jubilee unto you  c Levit xxv  Now to confirm all that I have hitherto as∣serted concerning the principal causes of God's Anger against the Jews my Readers are earnestly requested to re∣mark that this  material Reformation  was  ACCEPTED BY THE ALMIGHTY who even condescended to signify by his Prophet that the People  HAD DONE RIGHT IN HIS SIGHT IN PROCLAIM∣ING LIBERTY EVERY MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOUR  ver And had the Jewish Government at that time persevered in this NECESSARY ACT OF JUSTICE AND BROTHERLY LOVE they might probably as  Charity covers a multitude of Sins  have received Grace for a further Amendment and might have obtained a mitigation or at least a respite or postponing of those dreadful Judgements which had long been de∣nounced by the Prophets against that devoted Nation but alas the just Decrees were confirmed on account of the want of sincerity and the deplorable impenitence on their part for no sooner was  the appearance of God's ap∣proaching Vengeance  withdrawn by the sudden retreat of the  Chaldaeans  from  the Siege on the approach of Pharaoh's Army  Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard Tidings of them they departed from Jerusalem  Chap xxxvii See also th verse at which time says Grotius  the King and the Princes  repealed the Popular Decree concerning  Liber∣ty  mentioned in the th chapQuo tempore says he Rex et Principes resciderunt decretum de popu∣larium libertate ut habuimus c  When the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army  see chap xxxvii than the wretched tyrannical Masters who  could not repent  of their enormous  Op∣pressions  yet speedily  repented  of their temporary  Benevolence  and being them∣selves entangled in a much more dan∣gerous  Bondage  through their abomi∣nable Avarice under that old  Slaveholder  and hard  Taskmaster  the Devil they wickedly renewed their former iniquitous claims of  private Property  in the Persons of their poor Brethren and  caused the Servants and the Handmaids whom they had  LET GO FREE  to re∣turn  and brought them  INTO SUB∣JECTION  for Servants and for Hand∣maids  Jer xxxiv Perhaps they thought to excuse themselves like our  modern African Merchants  and  Ame∣rican Planters  by pleading THE NECES∣SITY of  tolerating Slavery  and the  ex∣action of involuntary Service viz  that the Profit arising therefrom was  necessary  for their support and that Husbandry and other laborious business could not be performed at so cheap a rate by free hired Servants as by Slaves but whe∣ther such reasons as these or others of greater weight were then alledged is not material it is sufficient for the pre∣sent argument to be certain that what∣ever were their Pretences or Excuses for enslaving their Brethren they did only  deceive themselves  and hasten the Vengeance of Almighty God upon their own heads for they were very soon afterwards delivered up into the hands  of their Enemies the Babylonian Ty∣rants under whom their Countrymen that had been carried away in the for∣mer Captivities  experienced  IN THEIR OWN PROPER PERSONS  the deplorable condition of  SLAVES being a most just punishment for that TYRANNY and  un∣reasonable  VASSALAGE with which they so unlawfully  oppressed their  POOR BRE∣THREN Such was their  Crime  I mean their  principal Crime  or at least one of those  Crimes  which was  most abominable  in the sight of a  merciful  GOD for they were indeed notoriously guilty of Idolatry and many other detestable Crimes besides this and such their  reta∣liated Punishment  which was inflicted expressly on that account"THERE∣FORE" says the Text so that  the reason  of God's interposition is manifest  the Word of the  LORD  came to Jeremiah from the  LORD  saying Thus saith the  LORD JEHOVAH  the  GOD  of Israel  I made a Covenant with your Fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the Land of Egypt  OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDMEN  a circum∣stance which they were frequently commanded  never to forget  as I have before remarked but sympathetically to learn MERCY thereby  But thou shalt remember that thou wast a  Bondman  in Egypt and the LORD thy GOD  redeem∣ed thee thence  THEREFORE I command thee to do this Thing  Deut xxiv also c xv and xvi c c    say∣ing At the end of seven years let ye go every man his Brother an Hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt  LET HIM GO FREE  from thee but your Fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear And ye were now turned and had  DONE RIGHT IN MY SIGHT IN PROCLAIMING LI∣BERTY EVERY MAN TO HIS NEIGH∣BOUR  Mark this ye sordid Tyrants of the Earth the ALMIGHTY LORD OF THE UNIVERSE hath con∣descended to inform you that the PROCLAIMING LIBERTY  every man to his neighbour  and  all Men  without distinction are at this day to be esteemed  your Neighbours and Brethren  IS RIGHT IN HIS SIGHT    and ye had made a Co∣venant before me in the House which is called by my Name But ye turned and polluted my Name and caused every man his Servant and every man his Handmaid whom he had  SET AT LIBERTY AT THEIR PLEASURE  or to their mind or will  to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for Servants and for Hand∣maids  THEREFORE  now mark the Punishment ye wretched Slaveholders and Advocates for  private Pro∣perty in the Persons of Men  thus saith the  LORD  JEHOVAH  Ye have not hearkened unto me  IN PROCLAIM∣ING LIBERTY  every one to his Brother and every man to his Neighbour be∣hold  I PROCLAIM A LIBERTY  for you saith the  LORD  significantly marking his detestation of  Slaveholding  by an ironical repetition of that opposite measure the  proclaiming  of LIBERTY which they had neglected and there∣fore God himself PROCLAIMED a dif∣ferent kind of LIBERTYLIBERTY  to the Sword to the Pestilence and to the Famine  here is a PROCLAMA∣TION OF LIBERTY  with a vengeance  But alas the hardened Jewish  Slaveholders  like  Englishmen  nowadays were  too wicked  to take warning  And I will make you  saith the Lord  to be removed into all the Kingdoms of the Earth  that is to be led away  into Captivity  by their Enemies SLA∣VERY being a very just as well as com∣mon punishment for TYRANTS  And I will give the men that have trans∣gressed my Covenant which have not performed the Words of the Covenant  which they had made before me when they cut the Calf in twain and passed between the Parts thereof  For in making the Covenant before God in the Temple to  proclaim Liberty  as mentioned in the th verse they divided the victim in two parts and passed between the parts in imitation of the solemn Covenant which God made with  Abraham  when a smoaking furnace and a lamp of fire passed between the pieces of the divided Heifer She Goat c as men∣tioned in Gen xv to signifying says Vatablus  that they wish to be put to death as this Calf was cut asunder if they break the Covenant  In federe pangendo dividebant vitulum et per medium transi∣bant significantes se optare emori ut ille vitulus erat caesus si fedus frangerent Crit Sac Tom "Nam significabat" says Munster  ritus ille ut si quis dolo malo discessisset a pollicitis illum quo∣que secaret Dominus et occideret horrendé  Crit Sac And Clarius gives a part of the words used on those occasions "Ordo orationis" says he  est  Dabo viros qui praevaricantur fedus meum sicut vitulum quem conciderunt  c In Templo enim im∣molarant ritu celeberrimo diviso vitulo per cujus partes utrinque oppositas incedebant simulque jurabant et se devovabant ut eveniret ipsis sicut vitulo si fedus rumperent Dicit ergoDabo vos sicut vitulum il∣lum c    the Princes of Judah and the Prince of Jerusalem the Eunuchs and the Priests  and all the People of the Land which passed between the parts of the Calf I will even  GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES  and into the hand of them that  SEEK THEIR LIFE  and their dead Bodies shall be for Meat unto the Fowls of the Heaven and to the Beasts of the Earth  Manifestly alluding to the heavy curse to which with their own consent they had rendered them∣selves liable by their breach of the Solemn Covenant viz that they should be slain as the Calf was when they made the Covenant and their dead bodies be left like the  divided parts of the Calf  to the  fowls of the air  c for in the description of that solemn rite in Genesis we read that"the Fowls came down upon the Carcases" and"Abram drove them away" Gen xv    And  ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH  and the  PRINCES  will I give into the hand of their Enemies and into the hand of them that seek their Life  Here is a distinct repetition of a part of  the same Judgment  against the  King  and  Princes  though it does not appear that the  King  himself was actually guilty of slaveholding however it seems he neglect∣ed to enforce the Laws of the Land in behalf of the injured poor and by suffering others with impunity to hold  their Brethren  in an  unnatural Bondage  he be∣come a party in the oppression and of course a sharer of the punishment O that modern Kings who in any degree consent to the toleration of slavery in their do∣minions would think of this tremendous example and exert every Royal Prerogative that they are le∣gally invested with in restraining their Princes and People from oppressing their  poor Brethren  in main∣taining the  natural Rights  of  Mankind  and in defend∣ing the Poor from the Rich the Weak from the Strong by ballancing the  Power  of the Nobles or rich Land∣holders by the Official  Power  of the Crown in behalf of the just Rights of the Common People These are the most essential purposes of Regal Government and Royal Prerogative which surely can never be exerted either so profitably or so  safely  on any other occasions whatsoever for it is by strict Justice or  Righteousness alone  that a King's Throne can be truly and  safely established  and not by refined sophistical Politicks Mercenary Armies or Parliamentary Corruption    and  into the hand  continued the Pro∣phet  of the King of Babylon's Army which are gone up from you  for the withdrawing of the Babylonian Army was a very  recent instance  of God's  Mercy  which rendered more notorious the in∣gratitude of those who so immediately  broke the solemn Covenant of PRO∣CLAIMING LIBERTY but GOD's VEN∣GEANCE kept pace with  the Oppression  of the unrepenting Tyrants  Be∣hold  I WILL COMMAND SAITH THE LORD  and  CAUSE THEM TO RETURN TO THIS CITY  a remark∣able instance of God's overruling Pro∣vidence in the World The haughty selfwilled Babylonian Monarch and his Men of War perceived not that they were mere instruments in the hands of God  and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and I  WILL MAKE  the Cities of Judah a Desolation without an Inhabitant  Jer xxxiv  There is no order of time preserved in the Collection of Jeremiah's Prophe∣cies as I have already remarked for the two next chapters  viz  the th and th contain Prophecies which  were delivered several years before in the reign of Jehoiakim but the th chapter relates to the same time exactly as the th chapter last quoted  viz  the times when  Pharaoh's Army was come forth out of Egypt  xxxvii which occasioned the departure for the present of the Chaldeans And it was probably in the interval between these two circumstances  viz after  Pharaoh was  come forth  from Egypt and was advancing but  before  the Chaldeans left the Siege on that account that Zedekiah sent two Mes∣sengers to the Prophet who was then at liberty as the th verse expressly de∣clares to desire  his Prayers  Pray now unto the Lord our God for us  but the Prophet's Answer on that occa∣sion was not returned till the Chaldeans  departed from  Jerusalem as mentioned in the th verse and probably also not till after the Covenant about  Liberty  was broken  Then came the Wor  of the Lord to Jeremiah saying Thus saith the  LORD  the  GOD OF ISRAEL  Thus shall ye say to the King of Judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me Behold  PHARAOH's  Army which is come forth to help you shall return to Egypt into their own Land And the  CHALDEANS SHALL COME AGAIN  and fight against this City and take it and burn it with fire Thus saith the Lord  DECEIVE NOT YOURSELVES  saying The Chaldeans shall surely de∣part from us for they shall not depart For though ye had smitten the whole Army of the Chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but  WOUNDED MEN  among them  now mark how impossible it is for Slaveholders to stand before their Enemies  "yet should they"  that is the wounded men  rise up every Man in his Tent and burn this City with Fire  Ch xxxvii to ver  It was also during this recess of the Babylonian Army that the Prophet was put into prison by the Princes for taking that opportunity to attempt his escape from Jerusalem See ch xxxvii  Afterwards  For he remained in Prison  many days  as we read in the th verse  Zedekiah the King sent and took him out and the King asked him secretly in his House and said Is there  any  Word from the Lord And Jere∣miah said There is for said he Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the King of Babylon  c  Ch xxxvii  The Prophet also took this opportu∣nity of remonstrating to the King con∣cerning his own case"  Moreover Je∣remiah said unto King Zedekiah  WHAT  HAVE I OFFENDED AGAINST THEE  or against thy Servants or against this  People that ye have put me in Pri∣son  This shews that  speaking Truth  be it ever so severe provided it is not spoken for the sake of mere abuse but for the purposes of warning and amendment ought not to be esteemed  an Offence  for surely no  truths  can ever be more harsh or severe than those uttered by Jeremiah against the Court of Zede∣kiah  Where  are  now your Pro∣phets which prophesied unto you say∣ing The King of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this Land  For these Evil Counsellors it seems like true implements of the Devil attempted by their false intelligence from time to time to make the King firm in his bad measures and wicked policy    Therefore hear now I pray thee O my Lord the King let my supplication I pray thee be ac∣cepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the House of Jonathan the Scribe lest I die there  And it appears that Zedekiah notwithstanding his general wickedness yet had no per∣sonal pique against the Prophet but was  well inclined to grant his Petition as also a daily allowance of Bread as long as any could be procured  "  Then  " says the Text  Zedekiah  the King commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into  the Court  of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the Bakers Street  until all the Bread in the City were spent    And when the Princes advised Zede∣kiah to put Jeremiah to death because he publicly exhorted  all the People  to go over to the Enemy  Which would have been  treason to the state  and a high crime had not the Kingdom been actually condemned by the word of God viz  Thus saith the Lord  He that remaineth in this City shall die by the Sword by the Famine and by the Pestilence but he that  goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live  for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live Thus saith the Lord This City shall  surely be given into  the hand of the King of Babylon's army which shall take it Therefore the Princes said unto the King We beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this City and the hands of  all the people  in speaking  such words  unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt  c Chap xxxviii to  it appears  that though the King thought he had not sufficient authority to oppose their Council yet he would not concern himself against the Prophet to condemn him but only left him in their hands  Then Zedekiah the King said Behold he  is  in your hand  for the King  is  not  he that  can do  any  thing against you  Chap xxxviii ver  and no sooner was the King in∣formed of the dangerous situation of Jeremiah from the malice and injustice of the Princes  My Lord the King these men have  done evil  in all that they have done to Jeremiah the Pro∣phet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for  there is  no more bread in the City  Chap xxxviii ver  than he gave ex∣press orders to the generous and con∣scientious  Ethiopian  who had represent∣ed the case to take a Guard of thirty Men and draw him up from the Dun∣geon and he was placed in the Court of the Prison  Chap xxxviii  The King after∣wards  sent for the Prophet and had a private conference with him he also bound himself under a solemn Oath that he would neither kill him nor give him up to his Enemies and as he kept his promise notwithstanding that Jere∣miah still persevered in denouncing the most tremendous Judgements against him and the whole Kingdom it is manifest that the king had no personal resent∣ment against the Prophet being sensi∣ble probably by that time of Jere∣miah's sincerity and innocence as well as of the truth of his Warnings tho' he had not grace and humility enough to submit himself to the only alterna∣tive from destruction which God was now pleased to offer him perhaps in consideration of his favour to Jeremiah and which the Prophet as affectionately pressed him to accept but in vain  These circumstances and several others will be found in the th chap∣ter    If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the King of Babylon's Princes then thy soul shall live and this City shall be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house But if thou wilt not go forth to the King of Babylon's Princes then shall this City be given into the hand of the Chal∣deans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand And Zedekiah the King said unto Jeremiah I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans left they de∣liver me into their hand and they mock me But Jeremiah said They shall not deliver thee  Obey I beseech thee the voice of the  LORD which I speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live  c  Chap xxxviii ver to The remainder of the chapter contains a further de∣scription of the judgements that were to take place in case ho refused to accept of the alternative above men∣tioned as also an account of Zedekiah's expedient for concealing what had passed between him and Je∣remiah from the Princes  but we must go back to the d chapter for the continuation of the History which we there find advanced to the  tenth  year of Zedekiah's reign the Siege being still carried on and Jeremiah still shut up in the Court of  the Prison In the d th and th verses we find a repetition of some cir∣cumstances of the dreadful Vengeance  before  denounced against Zedekiah but they are not mentioned in that place as being then repeated by the

Captivity in token of which the Pro∣phet's Kinsman Hanameel was pro∣videntially sent to tender to him the purchase of a Field in Anathoth to which he was next Heir From the th to the th verse of this chapter is containedthe Prophet's Prayer on that occasion wherein he most solemnly de∣scribes the  Mercy  as well as the  Ven∣geance  of GOD then dreadfully ap∣proaching  Ah Lord God Behold thou hast

remarkable  were God's severe Judgements against the great  Egyptian  SLAVEHOLDER and his  Kingdom  who refused to  PRO∣CLAIM LIBERTY  to his Bond Ser∣vants "  and in Israel  In  Israel also  even in  that very nation  which the Almighty by the abovementioned Signs and Wonders delivered from the HOUSE OF BON∣DAGE and restored to their  natural Rights  which nevertheless was since become  notorious  for the  same kind of oppression  that God had punished in  Egypt  for a Crime which of all others must be most intolerable in the Sight of the GREAT REDEEMER FROM SLA∣VERY it being not only a proof of the most shameful ingratitude but also a notorious breach of God's ex∣press Command viz to  remember  that they themselves had been BONDMEN IN EGYPT See Deut xv xvi xxiv and    and among  " other  Men  Amongst  other Nations  also GOD's VEN∣GEANCE against  Tyrants  and  Oppressors  hath been ma∣nifested some examples of which shall hereafter be inserted    and hast made thee a Name as at this

was laid desolate  and hast brought thy People Israel out of the Land of Egypt with Signs and with Wonders and with a strong Hand and with a stretchedout Arm and with great Terror  For that wonderful example of GOD's VEN∣GEANCE against TYRANNY and of his MERCY IN REDEEMING  a Nation from  SLAVERY was of all others the most eminent and confequently the of∣tenest repeated in Scripture as in this place 'till the accomplishment of the much more  glorious redemption  from SPIRITUAL SLAVERY the BONDAGE  of the De∣vil  Forasmuch then as the Children are Partakers of flesh and blood he  that is

time present before his eyes "BEHOLD THE MOUNTS" said he "  They are come unto the City to take it" c  And after reciting some other Causes of God's Anger against his Peo∣ple as  Disobedience Idolatry c  and declaring the certainty of the Desolation that would follow he once more promises a happy Return to their own Land which is also again repeated in the fol∣lowing chapter xxxiii with the additi∣onal Promise of the BRANCH OF RIGH∣TEOUSNESS  to grow up unto David that  should  execute  JUDGEMENT  and  RIGH∣TEOUSNESS  which Zedekiah had so notoriously neglected for  on these Terms alone

National Establishment  which God had given them no  foreign armaments  could have had power to DEPRIVE them of  God's Gift  had not their own  iniquities  deprived them of  God's protection  It was the NEGLECT OF JUSTICE and NATURAL RIGHT or according to  the scripture phrase of JUDGEMENT and RIGHTEOUSNESS which drew down GOD'S VENGEANCE upon them This was apparently THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE let  Britain  therefore tremble for her notorious national  corruption  and  oppressions  OF THAT HORRID MISERY WHICH REIGNED IN JERUSALEM DURING THE BABYLONIAN SIEGE    They that did feed delicately are

th year of Ze∣dekiah when as we read in the th chapter "  the City was broken up  And it came to pass that when  Zedekiah  the "King of Judah saw them" that is  Princes of Ba∣bylon  who sat in the Middle Gate after the CITY WAS BROKEN UP See ch xxxix  and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the King's Garden by the gate between the two walls and he went out the way of the plain But the Chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to  Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon  to RIBLAH in the Land of HAMATH where he gave Judgement upon him  Ch xxxix Compare this with the Note in page  and then was the DREADFUL VEN∣GEANCE so repeatedly denounced by the Prophet against  Zedekiah  ready to burst on the Head of that  wicked Prince  who in addition to all his other Crimes had so lately violated the solemn Cove∣nant of PROCLAIMING LIBERTY TO THE BOND SERVANTS by neglecting to enforce the Laws of God and of his Country in behalf of the poor OP∣PRESSED PEOPLE that had been com∣pelled by their petty Tyrants to return into BONDAGE  This was so notorious a contempt of JUSTICE and RIGHTEOUSNESS like the  Toleration of  SLAVERY  in the  BRI∣TISH EMPIRE that GOD'S VEN∣GEANCE before denounced was inevi∣tably confirmed and the KING was soon afterwards  delivered up  with ALL HIS NOBLES AND MEN OF WAR that remained into the hands of their en∣raged Enemies agreeable to the just decree of GOD before recited from the th chapter  his Sons were slain  BE∣FORE  HIS EYES  Then the  King of Babylon  flew the Sons of  Zedekiah  in RIBLAH  before his eyes  also the  King of Babylon slew  ALL THE NOBLES  of  JUDAH  Chap xxxix See also Chap lii    and  HIS EYES  beheld  THE EYES  of the stern Tyrant of Babylon  as the Prophet Jeremiah had very circumstantially foretold  Thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and THINE EYES shall behold the EYES of  the King of Babylon  and he shall speak  with thee  MOUTH  to  MOUTH and thou shalt go to Babylon  c Chap xxxiv  but he  never  SAW  more  for HIS EYES were PUT OUT by the order of the im∣placable CONQUEROR  Moreover he  put out Zedekiah's Eyes  and  bound him with Chains to carry him to Babylon  Chap xxxix And in the d chapter where these circumstances are repeated we find the follow∣ing addition  viz  that  the King of  BABYLON  car∣ried him to Babylon and put him in prison to the day of his death  Chap lii  who there∣by fulfilled another not less remarkable Prophecy of Ezekiel to the Captives at  Babylon telling them from God  I will  BRING HIM TO BABYLON  the Land of the Chaldeans yet shall he  NOT SEE IT  though be shall die there  Ezek xii Now to complete this tremendous Example of God's Judge∣ment against  the Toleration of Slavery  I must add that the King of Babylon SLEW ALL THE NOBLES OF JUDAH that is ALL that were taken at that time and having put out Zedekiah's Eyes as beforementioned he bound him  Slavelike  with Chains to carry him to Babylon where he and the remainder of the Jewish Captives the former SLAVEHOLDERS whose OP∣PRESSION he had unjustly tolerated became according to the phrase of our modern  Slaveholders  the PRIVATE PROPERTY of the Babylonian Tyrant and his Soldiers  They took the young Men to grind and the Children fell  under the Wood  Lam v In the same chapter the mise∣ries of a foreign Jurisdiction are strongly delineated  Our Inheritance is turned  TO STRANGERS  our Houses to Aliens We are Orphans and Fatherless our Mothers are as Widows We have drunken our Water for Money our Wood is sold unto us  OUR NECKS ARE UNDER PERSECUTION WE LABOUR AND HAVE NO REST  c A just recompence for SLAVE∣HOLDERS and again"SERVANTS" or Slaves  "have ruled over us"  cmdash  They ravished the Women in Sion and the Maids in the cities of Judah  PRINCES  are hanged by their hand the faces of Elders were not honoured  THEY TOOK THE YOUNG MEN TO GRIND AND THE CHILDREN FELL UNDER THE WOOD  c Such a  Retaliation  of  Tyranny  must every nation expect that promotes and tolerates  Slavery and Oppression  Nothing but severe Repen∣tance and Amendment can prevent it O that my countrymen would consider this  under the heavy burthens of their BABYLONIAN SLAVEHOLDERS But what is still more remarkable the  Poor of the People  who were probably the  Bondmen  and  Bondwomen  whose Cause God had avenged by these heavy Judgements were left at home to possess the Lands and Vineyards of their former  tyrannical Masters  for  NEBUZARADAN  the  Captain of the Guard lest of the  POOR OF THE PEOPLE WHICH HAD NO∣THING  in the Land of Judah and gave them Vineyards and Fields  AT THE SAME TIME  Jer xxxix  Now if  the African Traders West India Merchants  and  American Planters  could make it appear that their imagi∣nary PROPERTY in  Negro Slaves  for which they so strenuously contend is as justly acquired as the PROPERTY in  Hebrew Captives  which the Babylo∣nians acquired by their providential suc∣cess in the Jewish War yet this would not afford them any just excuse or comfort for their wounded Consciences if they should ever have grace to feel remorse because it appears that  this  VERY BONDAGE  of the  JEWS though apparently according to their deserts brought upon the CHALDEANS  in their turn  the same deplorable  slavish  con∣dition  which they like our modern  Slaveholders  thought they had an un∣doubted right to impose on their imagi∣nary  Property  the Jewish Captives  And yet Nebuehadnezzar did not  burn and depopulate  the Cities of  Judaea  merely for the sake of  procuring Slaves  like the black Accomplices of the  Royal African Company  His War was just and honourable he came to punish a rebellious and wicked tributary Nation which had  without any just reason and contrary to the express Commands of  GOD  by the Prophets  attempted to shake off their Allegiance to the Babylonian Em∣pire to which they had long been subject for the wicked Jewish King Manasseh the Son of King Hezekiah had long before been conquered and carried into Captivity to Babylon  And the Lord spake to  Mauasseh  and  to his people  but they would not hearken Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the Captains of the Host of the King of Assyria which took Manasseh among the Thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to Babylon  Chron xxxiii    by the King of Assyria  According to Bishop Usher this King of As∣syria was  Esarhaddon  who as he relates annexed the dominion of Judaea to the Imperial Crown of Assyria and carried King Manasseh to Babylon but upon his repentance mercifully restored him to his Royal Dignity though he was still to remain subject to the Imperial Jurisdiction of Assyria and afterwards when the whole Assyrian Power devolved to Nebu∣chadnezzar in the commencement of the Babylonian Empire Jehoiakim King of Judah became his ser∣vant three years and then turned and rebelled against him  Kings xxiv  but the kingdom being again conquered a few years after in the reign of his Son Jehoiachin the King of Babylon carried the latter into captivity and made Zedekiah King in his room who also rebelled both against God and the King of Babylon and thereby wilfully drew down those heavy judgements upon himself and the kingdom  and the Assyrian Power afterwards devolved to  Nebuchadnezzar  in the Commencement of the Babylonian Empire who had also himself thrice before this last  War conquered  Judea  and  Zedekiah  the last Monarch before the Captivity  reigned expressly by his  APPOINTMENT so that his wilful rebellion clearly justified the Babylonian Invasion and add to this that the Assyrians  O Assyria the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation I will send him against a hypocritical Nation and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets Howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but  it is  in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few  c Isaiah x  and Ba∣bylonians  And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon my servant cand ALL NATIONS shall SERVE him and his Son's Son until the very time of his Land come and then many nations and great kings shall SERVE THEMSELVES of him  c Jer xxvii Here is a manifest instance of  National Retri∣bution  in kind  were in a very extra∣ordinary manner preordained and au∣thorized by Almighty God to punish the crying wickedness of the Israelites and Jews which surely may be alledg∣ed as a further justification of the con∣quest  and subsequent  Right of Service  if it may be esteemed a  Right  which both  Assyrians  and  Babylonians  seemed to have acquired thereby  But notwithstanding all these re∣markable circumstances which render∣ed the claims of these  Eastern Nations  to the  Jewish Captives  infinitely more equitable than any claims that our  mo∣dern slaveholders  can produce in favour of their unnatural oppression of the poor wretched Captives of Africa yet both  Assyrians  and  Babylonians  as well as ALL the other  neighbouring nations  that were guilty of the like oppressions drew down upon themselves a severe  national  RETRIBUTION of Vengeance for pre∣sumptuously  enslaving  and  oppressing  each other for though they were  in∣struments in God's hand  for the mutual punishment of each other and acted expressly by his permission for that pur∣pose  yet  the Causes of Action  which they themselves were capable of perceiv∣ing and by which they were apparently moved were very different  Avarice Pride Lust of Power the unjust Dictates of Wicked and Corrupt Hearts  were the only  personal Motives  but the Almighty can turn even these  Evils  to his own Glory for the execution of his  eternal Justice  and in due time will excute VENGEANCE even on  the Instruments of his  VEN∣GEANCE  Wherefore it shall come to pass  says Isaiah in the th chapter  that when the Lord hath performed his whole Work upon Mount Zion and on Je∣rusalem I will punish the Fruit of the stout heart of the  KING OF ASSYRIA  and the Glory of his high looks For he saithBy the strength of  MY HAND I  have  DONE it  and by  MY WISDOM  for I am prudent and I have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their Treasures and have  PUT DOWN  or enslaved  THE INHABITANTS  like a valiant  man  And my hand hath found as a nest the  RICHES OF THE PEOPLE  and as one gathereth Eggs  that are  left have I gathered all the Earth and there was none that  MOVED THE WING  or opened the mouth or peepedShall the Ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith  or  shall the  SAW  magnify itself against him that shaketh it  Thus God asserts the actual guidance of his Providence in human Transactions by representing the haughty unbelieving Monarchs of  Assyria  as mere WORK TOOLS in his hands  as if the rod should shake  itself  against them that lift it up  or  as if the staff should lift up  itself as if it were  no wood Therefore shall the Lord the  LORD OF HOSTS  or ARMIES Jehovah Tsabaouth  send among his sat ones leanness and under his Glory  he shall kindle a burning like the burn∣ing of a fire  c Chap x  And after encouraging the remnant of Israel to  stay upon the Lord the Holy one of Israel in truth  by a pro∣mise  THAT THE CONSUMPTION DE∣CREED  That isDECREED on account of the  Na∣tional Injustice and Tyranny  described in the st verse of the same chapter viz  Wo unto them that  DE∣CREE UNRIGHTEOUS DECREES  i e make Laws that are contrary to  Natural Right and Justice    Laws like those whereby the AFRICAN SLAVETRADE is  promoted  and  encouraged  or like those whereby MARRIAGE is  restrained  like those also which  tolerate the Oppression  of the poor  Colliers Salters  and  Miners  in  Scotland  or like those  diabolical  DECREES of UNRIGHTEOUSNESS and GRIEVOUSNESS which some of our  American assemblies  have wickedly PRE∣SCRIBED against their poor  Negro Slaves  many of which I have particularly pointed out in my Representation against Sla∣very pages to  and THAT WRITE GRIEVOUSNESS WHICH THEY HAVE PRESCRIBED  to turn aside the needy from Judgement and to take away the right from the poor of my people that Widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless And what will ye do  IN THE DAY OF VISITATION AND IN THE DESOLATION which SHALL  come  FROM far  cwhich was manifestly  THE CONSUMPTION DECREED  c  shall  OVERFLOW  with  RIGHTEOUSNES  for the promises of blessings and forgiveness are generally blended with the denunciations of God's Judgements in order to encourage Re∣pentance and Reliance on God the Prophet comforts the Sufferers under the present Affliction with an assurance that it shall not be of long continuance  Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Hosts O my People that dwellest in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with a Rod and shall lift up his Staff against thee after the manner of Egypt  that is by holding them in A SEVERE BONDAGE as the  Egyptians had formerly done  In via  Aegypti  Hebra∣ismus pro more ritu Aegyptiorum Eo modo quo afflixerunt te Aegyptii sic te affligent Assyrii  Vatablus  Caedet ille

said the Prophet  and  THE INDIGNATION  shall cease and  MINE ANGER IN THEIR DESTRUCTION  And the Lord of Hosts shall stir up  A SCOURGE  for him    viz  the Assyrian  accord∣ing to the Slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb    viz  by the Militia of Israel under Gideon  and  as  his Rod  was  upon the Sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt  Sicut inquit olim aquis Rubri Maris Aegyptios prostravi sola baculi elevatione per Mosen c Clarius Crit Sac    And it shall come to pass in that day  that  his  BURDEN  shall be taken away  FROM OFF THY SHOULDER  and his  YOKE  from off thy Neck and the  YOKE  shall be  DESTROYED  because of the an∣ointing  c  Again in the th chapter a similar Prophecy is delivered against Assyria  I will break the  Assyrian in my Land and upon my Mountains tread him under foot  And then he immediately alludes to the cruel  Bondage  and  Oppression  which drew down the VENGEANCE OF GOD upon the As∣syrian  "Then"  said the Prophet  shall his  YOKE  depart from off them and his  BURTHEN  depart from off their Shoulders  This VENGEANCE came upon the  Assyrians  not all at once but at several different periods that they might have warning and opportunity to repent One remarkable instance of it is fully recorded in scripture I mean that supernatural destruction of the greatest part of their army in one night after  Senna∣cherib  had blasphemed God by his Captains and pre∣sumptuously proposed to  carry away  the Inhabitants of jerusalem INTO CAPTIVITY for that was ex∣pressly his purpose as signified by Rabshakah  MAKE AN AGREEMENT WITH ME BY A PRESENT  and come out to me and eat  c  until I come and  TAKE YOU AWAY  to a Land like your own Land  c at another time Pharaoh Necho was charged with the execution of GOD's VENGEANCE against them Compare Kings xxiii with Chron xxxv c After which time we hear no more of the ASSYRIAN OPPRESSOR that Monarchy being soon after swallowed up in the BABYLONIAN TYRANNY so that his YOKE of course  departed  FROM OFF  the Nations he had  ENSLAVED  and his  BURTHEN  from off their shoulders  agreeable to the prophesy a∣bove  This  is  the purpose  that is  purposed upon the whole Earth and this  is  the hand  that is  stretched out upon all the Nations  c  Chap xiv  This seems to be a declaration that GOD'S VENGEANCE against ASSYRIA for TYRANNY and OPPRESSION  We to thee that  spoilest  and thou wast not  spoiled  and dealest  treacherously  and they dealt not  treacherously  with thee when thou shalt cease to  spoil  thou shalt be  spoiled  and when thou shalt make an end to deal  treacherously  they shall deal  treacherously  with thee  Isaiah xxxiii Here the Law of  Retribution  is clearly laid down Commen∣tators have generally understood this to be denounced against Assyria  should be a standing Example and Pre∣cedent for the Judgement of all other Nations but more especially of  the Na∣tions bordering on Judea  because there  are several other Prophecies concerning the neighbouring Nations which suffi∣ciently correspond with this example of VENGEANCE against  Assyria  both as to the mode and principal cause suffi∣ciently I say to prove that a similar fate to that of  Assyria  was the  PUR∣POSE  that was  PURPOSED UPON THE WHOLE EARTH    "For behold"  says the Prophet Joel chap iii  in those days and in that time when I shall bring again  THE CAPTIVITY OF JU∣DAH AND JERUSALEM  I will also gather  ALL NATIONS  and will bring them down into the Valley of  JEHOSHA∣PHAT  signifying JEHOVAH IS JUDGE or HATH JUDGED  and will plead with them there for  MY PEOPLE  and  for MY HERITAGE ISRAEL  whom they have  SCATTERED AMONG THE NATIONS  and parted my Land  And now the Prophet proceeds to mark the Scandal of Trading in Slaves in  strong  ironical  terms  And they have  CAST LOTS  A poor Negroe whom I was so happy as to assist in procuring his freedom was won I am informed by his last master in Virginia at a Game of Cards or some other such mode of  casting  LOTS  says he  for my People and have given a  BOY  for a  HARLOT  and sold a  GIRL  for  WINE  that they might drink Yea and what have ye to do with me O  TYRE  and  ZIDON  the  Liverpool  and  Bristol  The  SlaveTrade  carried on at these two places so far exceeds that which is chargeable to the Great Metropolis I mean more especially  in propor∣tion to the immense general commerce of the latter  that the guilt of London in that particular at least is very inconsiderable when compared with the accumulated  iniguity  and  bloodshed  for which the inhabitants of the other two places must inevitably be accountable if they do not repent See the comparative state of the SlaveTrade in page  of Palestine that were then become infamous by harbouring the most eminent Merchants in the SLAVETRADE of those days"  Will ye render me a  RECOMPENCE" mark this ye opulent  African Merchants  What  RECOMPENCE can ye make for such an abominable affront to the Cre∣ator of Mankind as your detestable Traffic  in Slaves  Cannot you be con∣tent with a  lawful  and  fair  Trade in  Golddust Ivory Gums Wax c c  which the African Coast will afford in abundance but you must  traffic in the  BODIES  of the poor wretched Inhabitants  to support your Luxuries like those who gave a BOY for a HARLOT and a GIRL for WINE Are you a jot  more righteous  who barter MEN WOMEN and CHILDREN by hundreds together for SUGAR and RUM Is this your RE∣COMPENCE to God for all his Mercies Repent in time lest God should return your RECOMPENCE upon your own heads for he has declared in this same Text"  If ye  RECOMPENSE  me  " that is in such an  unmerciful  manner  swistly  and  speedily will I return  YOUR RECOMPENCE UPON YOUR OWN  HEAD  c  And in the next verse but one the Prophet marks the SLAVE∣TRADE of  Tyre  and  Zidon  as one of the principal causes of his VENGEANCE  The Children also of Judah and the Children of Jerusalem have  YE SOLD  unto the  GRECIANS  that ye might re∣move them  FAR FROM THEIR BOR∣DER  but how much  farther  do the ENGLISH REMOVE THE POOR AFRICANS FROM THEIR BORDER  Behold I will raise them out of the place wither ye have  SOLD THEM  and will  RETURN YOUR RECOM∣PENCE UPON YOUR OWN HEAD  Observe how clearly THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION is here laid down  and I  WILL SELL  your  SONS  and your  DAUGHTERS  into the hands of the chil∣dren of  JUDAH  and they shall sell them  This is not to be considered as a permission to the Jews to  deal in Slaves  but only as a  prophecy  of GOD'S  retaliation  upon  Tyre  and  Zidon  which Grotius says was fulfilled when  Gaza Sidon  and  Tyre  were after∣wards taken by Alexander  Nempe cum Gaza Si∣don et Tyrus captae ab Alexandro  Crit Sac Tom p z for the Jews were undoubtedly guilty of sin when they fulfilled the prophecy and probably added thereby to their succeeding  national  affictions under  Antiochus  and other succeeding Ty∣rants for the same may be said of the  Jews  in this Case that the learned  Ferrerius  observed on the case of the  Assyrians  who were preordained by God to punish the  Israelitos  and many other neighbouring  Nations  for their  Oppressions  and other wickedness For though the  Assyrians  executed GOD'S  wrath  ex∣pressly by GOD'S  permission  or even as it were by  the Divine Command  in prophecy yet the  Assyrians  them∣selves as also the Jews after them did not consider their actions in any such light for the only motives they were sensible of were the dictates of their own wicked hearts and the love of unlawful gain Ferre∣rius in speaking of Isaiah's prophecy concerning the  Assyrians  chap x remarks  Versus  says he  dixerat quod Assyrius percussurus sit Israelitas sicutAegyptius hic  viz in the th verse  autem quod Dominus parcussurus sit Assyrios sicut Aegyptum Justum cnim est ut inquit Paulus  QUOD REDDAT DOMINUS VICEM IMPIIS QUI FILIOS DEI DI∣VEXANT  sive Aegyptii sive Assyrii sint  ETIAMSI  MIT  ENTE VEL ETIAM

wherever the  Christian Faith  is spread there goes with it a SWORD and a GUN  and your pruning hooks  continues the Prophet  into spears let the  WEAK  say I am  STRONG  Here again is another  mark of GOD'S VENGEAVANCE against oppressive Nations viz THE INFATU∣ATION OF THEIR COUNCILS  As∣semble yourselves  says the Prophet  and come all ye  NATIONS  In the common Translation it is rendered  "Come all ye Heathens"  but the original word  more properly signifies  the Nations  than  the Heathens  and gather yourselves together round about thither cause  THY MIGHTY ONES  to come down O Lord

against  two of these  oppressive Nations  expressly by name  EGYPT  shall be a desolation and  EDOM  shall be a desolate wilder∣ness  and the principal reason of these judgments is also as expressly assigned  for their  VIOLENCE  And the Egyptians "  for their  VIOLENCE" received from God A RETRIBUTION IN KIND which is still more awfully expressed by the prophet Isaiah  So shall the King of Assyria lead away the  EGYP∣TIANS  Prisoners and the  ETHIOPIANS  Captives young and old naked and barefoot even with  their  buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt  Isaiah xx A lively description this of the extreme misery and contempt with which the poor wretched Ethiopian Captives even to this day are oppressed and vilifiedBut by whomNot now surely by their old ene∣mies the Assyrians for they long ago received a just recompence for their  Tyranny  and  uncharitableness  and are wiped off from the face of the earth and may we not expect that the Almighty will also visit the  modern Oppressors  of the Ethiopians whose  barba∣rous  and  unfeeling  behaviour towards the poor naked  Ethiopian Captives  is equally notoriousMay we not expect that the Assyrians or  men of Nineveh shall rise in Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it  Matt xii for they were previ∣ously engaged in a  just war  against the Egyptians and Ethiopians they were  proveked  to  revenge  by  real In∣juries  by the lawless incursions of those unhappy Sons of of Ham and therefore they may seen to have some excuse for their severities But the Europeans and more notoriously the British Nation are now guilty of the same  horrid barbarity  and  uncharitableness  towards  the Ethiopians  WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION WHATSOEVER  except the most detestable Lust for un∣lawful Gain and Power  Let my deluded country∣men receive from me AN UNDENIABLE TOKEN  of the apporaching  DESTRUCTION AND MISERY which must inevitably overtake them if they do not repent  The Token  alas is already upon themLet them compare our present  national  condition with the se∣veral alarming circumstances which preceded the hor∣rible debasement of the  Egyptioans  and  Ethiopians  above mentioned even the best Histories of those  nations  cannot furnish a more exact and lively description of those Symptoms of approaching  nations  destruction than that which was declared by Isaiah in the spirit of prophecy  "I"  the Lord or  Jehovah    will set  THE EGYPTIANS  against  THE EGYPTIANS  and they shall fight every one against his Brother and every one against his Neighbour City against City  and  Kingdom against Kingdom  And the Spirit of Egypty shall fail in the midst thereof and  I will de∣stroy  the council thereof  Isaiah xix  against the Children of  JUDAH  be∣cause they have  SHED INNOCENT BLOOD  in their Land But  JUDAH  shall dwell for ever and  JERUSALEM  from generation to generation for I will cleanse their Blood that I have not cleansed for the Lord dwelleth in Zion  Joel iii "  The  PURPOSE" beforementioned  that is  PURPOSED  upon the whole earth  was manifest∣ed also in the Judgements denounced against THE EDOMITES by the Prophet OBEDIAH  Thy mighty men O Te∣man shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of  ESAU  may be cut off by slaughter  and then the Prophet assigns the usual causes of such VENGEANCE  For  thy VIOLENCE  against thy Brother  JACOB  shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever In the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the stran∣gers  CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE  his forces and Foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem  EVEN THOU wast AS ONE OF THEM  that is one that assisted to ENSLAVE  them  But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy Brother in the Day that he became a Stran∣ger  viz in the day that their Brethren the Israelites were carried away Captives into a strange land for it seems that even to  be neuter  or merely  look on"  like idle spectators when the LIBERTY  of their Brethren was at stake  would have been crimi∣nal but the EDOMITES added to this Crime by REJOICING at the Calamity and joining the triumphant Tyrants  neither shouldest thou have  REJOICED OVER  the Children of  JUDAH  in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken  PROUDLY  in the day of distress Thou shouldest not have en∣tered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea thou shouldest not have  LOOKED ON  their  AFFLIC∣TION  in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the  day of calamity Neither shouldest thou have stood in the Crossway to cut off those of his that did escape neither shouldest thou have  DELIVERED UP  or rather SHUT UP  or CONFINED as in  Slavery  or Foreign  Captivity  which by the Restoration promised to the  Cap∣tives  in the th and st verses seems to have been the case  those of his that  DID REMAIN  in the day of distress For the Day of the  LORD  is near upon all the Heathen  that is  ALL THE NATIONS  and then follows  THE PURPOSE  of RETRIBUTION  that is  PURPOSED  upon the whole earth    As THOU HAST DONE  it shall be  DONE  unto thee thy  REWARD  shall return  UPON THINE OWN HEAD  c  The like PURPOSE of RETRIBUTION was denounced against several Nations by the Prophet AMOS and first against the SYRIANS  Thus saith  THE LORD  for three Transgressions of  DAMASCUS  and for four I will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  nevertheless their unmerciful Tyranny over the Inha∣bitants of GILEAD is the only Trans∣gression mentioned  "because"  said the Prophet  they have threshed  GI∣LEAD  with Threshing Instruments of Iron But I will send  FIRE  into the House of  HAZAEL  the King of Syria anointed by Elijah  which shall devour the Palaces of  BENHADAD  I will break also the Bar of Damascus  c And then at last he denounces the ordinary punishment for Tyrants and Oppressors  And the people of  SYRIA  shall  GO INTO CAPTIVITY  unto  KIR  saith the  LORD  Amos i to This Prophecy was punctually fulfilled when AHAZ  King of Judah  hired TIG∣LATHPILESER  King of Assyria  to help him against the SYRIANS for we read  in the Kings xvi That  the King of Assyria hearkened unto him  viz AHAZ  for the King of Assyria went up against  DAMASCUS  and took it and  CARRIED  the people of  it  CAPTIVE  to  KIR  and slew  RE∣ZIN  REZIN was that turbu∣bulent and oppressive King of SYRIA who in another prophecy is compared to  "a sinoaking Firebrand"  Isaiah vii The same "PURPOSE" of RETRI∣BUTION was also declared by AMOS against the PHILISTINES  For three Transgressions of  GAZA  and for four I will not turn away  the punish∣ment  "thereof"  and yet only  one  of the  four  Transgressions is mentioned which we may therefore reasonably conclude to be the  principal  Transgres∣sion viz  "because"  says the Text  they  CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE THE WHOLE CAPTIVITY  to diliver  them  up to  EDOM  Grotius thinks that this Transgression was committed when Sennacherib invaded Judaea and that many Jews upon his first approach fled to the neigh∣bouring Regions and that the Philistines instead of protecting the poor fugitives who had done them no injury SOLD THEM  to the  EDUMAEANS as if they had been taken in open war  Cum Sennacheribus Judaeam invasit multi ad primum ejus adventum in vieinas regiones se recepere ut apparuit Esa xvi Philistini hos Judaeos qui nihil ipfis no∣cuerant non ut supplices protexerunt sed quasi bello captos VENDIDERUNT Idumaeis  Crit Sac Tom p Many other commentators besides Grotius have supposed this  Transgression  to have been committed during the troubles occasioned by  Senna∣cherib  's Expediton but it is not probable  though indeed it is possible  that this was the time to which the prophecy referred because if it really was the Pro∣phecy  foretold  the Transgression  itself  as well as the punishment of it for we find that the Prophecy was delivered  "in the days of Uzziah"  whereas the Event to which they refer did not happen till many years afterwards in the reign of  Ahaz  there are some in∣stances indeed of God's vengeance being really de∣nounced against particular crimes even before the crimes themselves were committed which I shall shew when I come to speak of Babylon but in the case before us there is no necessity for supposing any such anticipation it being much more probable that the offence referred to by the Prophecy was previously committed by the Inhabitants of GAZA after the combined army of the Philistines and Arabians had by God's permission subdued and plundered the inha∣bitants of Judea in the reign of Jehoram as related in the d Chron xxi c to which it is re∣ferred in Clarke's Annotations The cruelty of de∣livering up the CAPTIVES  to  EDOM at the time above∣mentioned would be much aggravated in the circum∣stances of these times for then the  Edomites  were be∣come inveterate enemies to the Jews having lately revolted from Judah and during that very reign had been beaten and many of them slain in a pitched battle with the Jews which rendered them the more implacable and therefore the unnatural cruelty OF DELIVERING UP the Jewish Captives to  Edom  at such a time must necessarily be esteemed a most heinous of∣fence in the sight of a merciful God  or rather as the word  more properly  signifies  to cause  them  to be shut up  that is in Bondage  to Edom  in short it appears from thence that they carried on the SLAVETRADE with EDOM as our  Liverpool  and  Bristol  Merchants and some at  London  but few in propor∣tion to the size of the place do at pre∣sent with America But they were al∣lowed but a short space for the enjoy∣ment  of their  unlawful gains  The de∣nunciations of VENGEANCE follows closely upon the very mention of that UNNATURAL OPPRESSION  But I will send a  FIRE  said the AL∣MIGHTY  on the Wall of  GAZA  This Prophecy was probably fulfilled in the reign of  Hezekiah  for we read in the Kings xviii that  he smote the  PHILISTINES  even unto  GAZA  and the Borders thereof from the tower of the Watchmen to the fenced City  But the Philistines of  Ashdod  c if not Gaza also began to feel the weight of GOD's VENGEANCE much sooner even by the hands of the King in whose reign the Prophecy was deliveredfor  "as long as he"  viz UZZIAH  sought  THE LORD GOD  made him to prosper And he went forth and warred against the  PHILISTINES and BRAKE DOWN THE WALL OF GATH and  the wall  of JABNEH and  the wall of  ASHDOD  and built Cities about  ASHDOD  and among the  PHILISTINES  And  GOD  helped him against the  PHILISTINES  and against the  ARABIANS  that dwelt in  GURBAAL  and the  MEHURIMS  c Chron xxvi And ASHDOD was afterwards taken by the troops of SARGON King of Assyria Isaiah xx under TARTAN one of his Generals who is mentioned likewise in Kings xviii so that this was pro∣bably when the  Assyrians  went up against  Jerusalem  in the Reign of  Hezekiah  A very severe VENGEANCE against the PHILIPSTINES was afterwards executed by the  Chaldeans  and long after that again by the  Macedonians  under Alexander    which shall devour the Palaces thereof and I will cut off the Inhabitants from  ASHDOD  and him that holdeth the Sceptre from  ASHKELON  and I will turn mine hand against  EKRON  and the Remnant of the  PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH  saith the  LORD GOD  Amos i  The Prophet then proceeds with a Denunciation of the like "PURPOSE" of GOD'S VENGEANCE against the opu∣lent City of TYRE and expressly  for the same offence  for the  Tyrians  were probably Confederates with the  Phi∣listines  of  Gaza  and other Cities of the  Phoenician  Coast when they assisted the  Arabians  to OPPRESS and ENSLAVE the Inhabitants of JUDEA  Thus saith  the  LORD  for three Transgressions of  TYRUS  and for four I will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  now be pleased to remark that though the  Tyrians  were notorious  Idolaters  and very wicked in many other respects yet here again the OPPRESSION of EN∣SLAVING THEIR BRETHREN even of a different Nation was the only Crime that God was pleased more particularly to impute and point out to them as being most heinous in his sight  "be∣cause"  said the Prophet  they deli∣vered up the  WHOLE CAPTIVITY TO EDOM  for TYRE was the  Philistine  LIVERPOOL it seems which supplied  Edom  with SLAVES  and remembered not the  BROTHERLY COVENANT  Probably alluding to the league that was made between SOLOMON and HIRAM King of TYRE mentioned in the first book of Kings v  and there was  PEACE BETWEEN HIRAM  and  SOLO∣MON  and they two  MADE A LEAGUE  together    but I will send a  FIRE  on the Wall of  TYRUS  which shall devour the Palaces thereof  Amos i  By another cotemporary Prophet Isaiah a RETRIBUTION IN KIND was denounced against TYRE  Is this your joyous City whose antiquity was of antient days  HER OWN FEET SHALL CARRY HER AFAR OFF  to sojourn    Ire pedibus suis in Captivitatem  says Clarius Crit Sac Tom p that is just as the poor slaves are nowadays brought down on foot from the inland parts of Africa to the slave markets on the coasts  who hath taken  THIS COUNCIL  against  TYRE  the crowning  City  whose Merchants are Princes whose Traffickers are the Honourable of the Earth  THE LORD OF HOSTS HATH PURPOSED IT  plainly referring to the PURPOSE which he had before declared in the xiv chap to be  PURPOSED UPON THE WHOLE EARTH  which I have shewn to be for the most part a RETRIBUTION IN KIND  to strain  or pollute  the pride of all Glory and to bring into contempt all the Honourable of the Earth  Isai xxiii  The like  purpose  of God's Vengeance is next denounced against Edom on account of her notorious violations also of  Brotherly Love  for the Almighty Father of Man∣kind will not see his creature Man op∣pressed and vilified without revenging the affront  Thus saith the Lord for  three Transgressions of  EDOM  and for four I will not turn away  the pu∣nishment  thereof because he did pur∣sue his Brother with the Sword and did  CAST OFF ALL PITY  as our modern American Slaveholders CAST OFF ALL PITY towards their poor RUN∣AWAY SLAVES for I have seen re∣wards publicly offered for the  Heads  of those poor oppressed People  From the  Carolina  Gazette by Robert Wells dated Dec  A HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD  Run away upwards of twelve

those times  which shall devour the Palaces of Boz∣rah  Amos chap i II  The Prophet in the next verse de∣nounces GOD'S VENGEANCE against the  bloodyminded Ammonites for their horrid barbarity in  murdering the Wives and Children of their Enemies  MURDER being a crime still more heinous in the sight of GOD than SLAVERY because  the robbing a man of his Life  is a higher Act of  Oppression  and unnatural  Violence  than  Bondage  it being indeed the  last degree of Oppression  that a Tyrant has in his power  Thus saith the Lord for three Transgressions of the Children of  AMMON  and for four will I not turn away  the punishment  thereof because they have  RIPPED UP THE WOMEN WITH CHILD OF GILEAD  This example shews that God will severely avenge himself of all such abandoned soldiers as those who  kill Women and Children  for we may be assured that no pretended Rules of War can justify such de∣testable outrages in his sight unless they can produce an express Commission from the Almighty for that purpose like that which was given to the Israelites against the wicked Canaanites c  that they might enlarge their bor∣der  Probably the  Ammonites  like some of our  Settlers and Planters at St Vincents  coveted  that fine  CREAM PART  of the Country  about Gilead then in the possession of their neighbours and might perhaps stir up their public Financiers to  settle an ar∣rangement for the disposal of the said Lands  without the knowledge and  consent of the antient and lawful pos∣sessors  as if the  supposed  political necessity to  enlarge their border  could justify ROBBERY and MURDER by authority of GovernmentAgainst similar crimes in Israel the Prophet thus denounced God's vengeance  Wo to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practice it because it is in the power of their hand And they co∣vet Fields and take  them  by viclence and Houses and take  them  away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage Therefore thus saith the  LORD  JEHOVAH  Behold against this family  apparently meaning the  Family  or stock of that whole nation  do I devise  AN EVIL  from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily  FOR THIS TIME IS EVIL  Mic ii to  For your hands are defiled with  BLOOD and your  fingers with  INIQUITY  none calleth for  JUSTICE  nor  any  pleadeth for  TRUTH  they trust in vanity and speak lies  THEY CONCEIVE MISCHIEF and BRING FORTH INIQUITY  c    and the act of Violence  is  in their hands Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction  or  breaking  are  in their paths  THE WAY OF PEACE THEY KNOW NOT  and  there is NO JUDGEMENT  i e right or justice  in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace  THEREFORE IS JUDGEMENT  i e right or equity  far from us neither doth  JUSTICE  properly RIGHTEOUSNESS  "overtake us"  c "  According to  their  deeds  " or more properly  ac∣cording to  RECOMPENCES  i e God's eternal laws of RETRIBUTION  "accordingly he"  i e Jehovah  will  REPAY  fury to his Adversaries  RECOMPENCE  to his Enemies to the  ISLANDS  he will  REPAY RECOMPENCE  Isaiah lix to the th verse    but I will kindle a Fire in the wall of Rabbah and it shall devour the Palaces thereof with shouting in the  day of battle with a Tempest in the day of the Whirlwind and their King shall  GO INTO CAPTIVITY  mark the proper punishment of Tyrants  HE AND HIS PRINCES TOGETHER  saith the  LORD  Amos i  Next in order the Prophet declares God's  Purpose  of Vengeance against Moab see the following chapter  Thus saith the Lord for three trans∣gressions  of  MOAB  and for four I will not turn away  the punishment  thereof because he burned the bones of the King of  EDOM  into lime  the Chaldee Interpreter adds    and plastered them like Chalk  or lime  in the House  This seems to have been done in extreme contempt to vi∣lify the Edomites and does not agree with the account of the particular hu∣man Sacrifice made by the King of Moab upon the Wall mentioned in Kings iii to which the margin of our English Bibles commonly refers us for that seems to have been a Sacrifice by the King of Moab of  his own Son  "Suum" viz Filium "inquam" says Grotius  non Idumaeae Praefecti ut quidam colligunt ex Amoso ii ubi alia respicitur Historia  Crit Sac Tom p  rather than a burning of the bones of the  King of Edom  We may however learn from this example that  God is offended with any contemptuous vilifying of the  Human Body  even  when dead  and how much more then will he be offended with those who vi∣lify their  living Brethren  by contemp∣tously holding them in a despicable Bondage  But I will send a Fire upon Moab  MOAB was condemned also by another Pro∣phet Isaiah for her want of Charity to the poor fu∣gitives of  Israel and Judah  in a time that God had delivered them into the hands of their enemies  "Hide the Outcasts"  said Isaiah in his denunciation of Judgement against MOAB  bewray not him that wandereth Let mine  OUTCASTS  dwell with thee  MOAB  Be thou a Covert to them from the face of the  SPOILER  for the  EXTORTIONER  is at an end the  SPOILER  ceaseth the  OPPRESSORS  are consumed out of the Land  Isaiah xvi    and it shall devour the Palaces of Kirioth and Moab shall die with tumult with shouting  and  with the sound of the trumpet and I will cut off  THE JUDGE FROM THE MIDST THEREOF  and will slay  ALL THE PRINCES THEREOF WITH HIM  saith the  LORD  Amos ii  To these Judgements of the several Nations the Prophet now adds the Condemnation of  Judah  left the Jews should imagine that GOD'S VENGEANCE was only to be denounced against  the Heathen Nations    Thus saith the Lord for three Transgressions of Judah and for four I will not turn away  the pu∣nishment  thereof because they have  DESPISED THE LAW OF THE LORD  now the Apostle Paul informs us that  all the Law is fulfilled in one word  even  in this Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself  Galat v and consequently the OPPRESSION OF THE POOR of which the Jews were notoriously guilty as I have shewn was next to Idolatry one of the most heinous Transgressions of the Law which principally drew down God's Vengeance upon them though it is not particularly mentioned in this place  and have not kept his Commandments  and their lyes caused them to err after the which their Fathers have walked But I will send a fire upon Judah and it shall devour the Palaces of Jerusalem  Amos ii  And last of all is declared the PUR∣POSE of  Retribution  and  Vengeance  that was PURPOSED upon the People of  Israel  to whom the Prophet Amos was more particularly sent to warn them of their approaching CAPTIVITY on account of their notorious  oppressions  and for the SLAVETRADE in particular  Thus saith the Lord for three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not turn away  the punishment  thereof be∣cause they  SOLD THE RIGHTEOUS FOR SILVER  and the  POOR FOR A PAIR OF SHOES  Amos ii And in the next chapter the prophet is di∣rected to call upon their old enemies the Philistines and Egyptians to bear  witness to the cause of God's vengeance on his own people  Publish in the Palaces of  ASHDOD  and in the Pa∣laces of the Land of Egypt and say Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of  SAMARIA  and behold the great  TUMULTS  in the midst thereof and the  OPPRESSED IN THE MIDST THEREOF  For they  KNOW NOT TO DO RIGHT  The Prophet Amos charges them still fur∣ther with their shameful perversion of JUSTICE and NATURAL RIGHT in the th chapter and th verse  Ye who  TURN JUDGEMENT TO WORMWOOD and LEAVE OFF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE EARTH  And a little afterwards he charges them with notorious corruption  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they  AFFLICT THE JUST  they  TAKE A BRIBE  and they  TURN ASIDE THE POOR IN THE GATE  from their  RIGHT  Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time  He then warns them to make use of that  Natural Knowledge  of  Good and Evil  which all mankind inherit from our first parents  Seek  GOOD  and not  EVIL  says the Prophet  that ye may live and so the Lord the God of Hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken Hate the  EVIL  and love the  GOOD  and establish  JUDGEMENT  in the Gate it may that the Lord God of Hosts will be gracious unto the Remnant of Joseph  Thus the ISRAELITES might have saved themselves from God's Vengeance by a timely repentance but they were too corrupt and wicked it seems to take warning for the Judge∣ment is immediately after denounced on account of the said NATIONAL CORRUPTION AND INJUSTICE  Therefore the Lord the God of Hosts the Lord saith thus  WAILING  shall be in all thy streets and they shall say in all the highways  ALAS ALAS  and they shall call the Husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing And in all vineyards shall be wailing for  I WILL PASS THROUGH THEE SAITH THE LORD  Now let the inhabitants of Great Britain examine themselves and enquire whether there are not COR∣RUPTIONS and INJUSTICE among them also which may be equally liable to draw down  God's  VEN∣GEANCE Whether their Representatives in the great National Assembly or  "Congregation of the People"  do not annually encourage and promote the AFRI∣CAN SLAVETRADE which includes infinitely more OPPRESSION and INJUSTICE  than the Israelites  were ever guilty of and whether the poor  Miners Colliers  and  Saliers  of Scotland who lately applied to them for relief from the monstrous OPPRESSION and IN∣JUSTICE of the unreasonable Landholders an op∣pression  at least equal to if not far exceeding the Israelitish Bondage of the Poor have yet received  re∣dress  for the Injuries done them or whether on the contrary the  Injustice  which never had any other foundation but that of  unjust Force  and  Usurpation  is not now confirmed for a certain number of years lon∣ger by act of Parliament But O my countrymen let us call to mind before it is too late the dreadful consequences of turning  JUDGEMENT INTO WORMWOOD  and of  leaving off Righteousness in the Earth  Let us remember the heavy Judge∣ments that are denounced against the  Oppressions of the poor  and that there is ONE who will surely avenge their cause  THE LORD JEHOVAH  is  HIS NAME  that strengtheneth the  SPOILED  against the  STRONG  so that the  SPOILED  shall come  AGAINST THE FOR∣TRESS THEY HATE HIM THAT REBUKETH IN THE GATE AND THEY ABHOR HIM THAT SPEAKETH UPRIGHTLY  Forasmuch therefore  continues the Prophet  as your  TREADING IS UPON THE POOR  and ye take from him burthens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant Vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of them For I  KNOW YOUR MANIFOLD TRANSGRESSIONS  and your mighty sins they afflict the Just they  TAKE A BRIBE  and they turn aside  THE POOR  in the Gate from their right  c Amos v to  saith the Lord  who store up Violence and Robbery in their Palaces Therefore thus saith  the Lord God and Adversary  there shall be  even round about the Land  and he shall bring down they Strength from thee and thy Palaces shall be spoil∣ed  c  Amos iii  Thus it appears that God was not less severe against his own peculiar Peo∣ple when guilty of Oppression and In∣justice than he was against the neigh∣bouring Nations for the like Offences And I hope the many examples which I have given of  God's Vengeance  against these Crimes and more especially against the Crime of  enslaving and vilifying Man∣kind  will awaken the attention of my Countrymen in general that they may seriously consider whether we have not just reason to fear the effects of GOD'S VENGEANCE  also upon  GREAT BRI∣TAIN  and  HER COLONIES  for similar Offences  Long before the present unhappy CIVIL WAR broke out  between the Mo∣ther  Country and her Colonies  I thought it my duty to give fair warning to his Majesty's Ministers  Extract of a Letter from the Author to Lord dated the th of February    His Majesty has been pleased lately to recommend to Parliament the providing new Laws  for  supplying Defects or  REMEDYING ABUSES  in such instances where it shall be requisite  and I apprehend my Lord that there is no instance whatever which requires more  immediate  redress than the present  miserable and deplorable  SLAVERY  of Ne∣groes and Indians as well as of white English ser∣vants in our Colonies  I say  immediate  redress be∣cause to be  in power  and to  neglect  as life is very uncertain even a day in endeavouring to put a stop to such monstrous injustice and abandoned wicked∣ness must necessarily endanger a man's  eternal  wel∣fare be he ever so great in  temporal  dignity or of∣fice  c  that some heavy VENGEANCE must inevitably overtake us according to the usual course of GOD'S Providence if the ini∣quitous SLAVETRADE and the  Tole∣ration of involuntary Bondage  were con∣tinued and that such  monstrous  OP∣PRESSION  and NATIONAL WICKED∣NESS  Extract of a letter from the Author to Lord dated the th of December  If the seasonable warning against  the crying national wickedness of promoting the  AFRICAN SLAVETRADE and  tolerating  SLAVERY in Ameri∣ca which I seht about three years ago in a private letter to Lord had been duly regarded I sin∣cerely believe that the present misunderstanding c and the alarming consequences which now threaten us would not have happened  Great Britain and her Colonies  seem to be preparing themselves for MUTUAL  For all the Law is fulfilled in  ONE WORD even  in this Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself But if we bite and devour one another take heed that  YE BE NOT CONSUMED ONE OF ANOTHER  Gal v See my Tract on "The Law of Liberty  or  Royal Law"  DESTRUCTION which alas is too ap∣parently merited on both sides for such monstrous OPPRESSION and NATIONAL WICKEDNESS  cannot escape a  NATIONAL PUNISHMENT  according  to the usual course of God's providence in the World un∣less a hearty repentance and amendment should avert the impending vengeance  c  cannot escape a  NATIONAL PUNISHMENT  according to the usual course of  GOD's PROVIDENCE  in the World unless a hearty Repentance and Amendment should avert the impending Vengeance  This Doctrine is unquestionably de∣monstrated I trust by the several Ex∣tracts from the Holy Scriptures which I have inserted in the preceding pages and the proof of it I thank God af∣fords me a double recompence for my labours in collecting them for it not only vindicates my previous assertions to the Ministers of his present Majesty but it confirms the  similar assertions  of my own Grandfather declared  near a Century ago  to the great National Assembly of this Kingdom  "Wicked men" said he  may be happy and prosperous here and good men may suffer many afflictions and tribulations without any the least reflection on the justice or goodness of the great Governor of the World because there is a farther day reserved for the adjusting all men's rewards according to their works But now the consideration of PUBLIC SOCIETIES and NATIONS is QUITE DIFFERENT NATIONS  are not made to be  IMMORTAL  but end with the world  No SOCI∣ETY AS A SOCIETY SHALL BE CALLED TO A FUTURE ACCOUNT  but all the rewards and pu∣nishments  they are capable of  AS SOCIETIES MUST BE ADJUDGED AND DISTRIBUTED TO THEM IN THIS PRESENT LIFE And therefore if we sup∣pose GOD to be the Judge and Governor of the World and of all the Nations in it as well as he is the Judge and Governor of particular persons we must likewise suppose that he administers all affairs so that  righteous  and  religious  NATIONS  have  IN THIS WORLD  the reward of their virtue in the blessings of peace and plenty and all manner of tempo∣ral prosperity  and on the other side  impious and incorrigible  NATIONS  are likewise punished  IN THIS WORLD  for their wickedness either by severe  JUDGE∣MENTS OR BY A TOTAL DESTRUCTION  as  GOD  in his infinite wisdom sees cause    The word of God doth all along bear testimony to the truth of this    There is no Judgement threa∣tened to any nation in the Holy Scripture and abundance of nations are there threatened but it is upon the account of the  Sins  and  Wickedness  they were guilty of Which Sins if they repented of so repented as to forsake them they might find mer∣cy And accordingly we find in fact that GOD ALWAYS DEALT WITH PEOPLE AND NATIONS ACCORDING TO THESE MEASURES  cAnd after citing the examples of the Ninevites Canaanites and Babylonians and after referring us to the Greek Roman and even to the Turkish history for more examples he remarks concerning the  Jews in particular that  every degree of PUB∣LIC VICE and departure from GOD's  Laws  was always  punished  with PUBLIC  Judgement  And on the other side every degree of PUBLIC  Repentance  and  Reformation  was always rewarded with PUB∣LIC  Happiness  and prosperity so that any one that could make a right estimate of that  nation  and how it stood as to VIRTUE  and  VICE might constantly make a Judgement likewise  how it would fare with them  as to their  outward temporal affairs  I must confess  says he  that generally speaking there is little force in those arguments that are drawn from examples but in the case I am now upon I think there is great weight in them For though we can not angue from GOD's dealing with  one person  that he will just deal in the same manner with another yet  as to  NATIONS and KINGDOMS THE CASE IS OTHERWISE as I before said For GOD's  Dispensations and Providences to them seem all to proceed upon  ONE IMMUTABLE FOUNDATION  which will be  THE SAME IN ALL AGES AND COUNTRIES namely the expression and vindication of  his justice and goodness  in this world  Archb Sharp's Sermons vol serm intitled  Virtue and Religion the only Means to make a Nation pros∣perous  The whole sermon is indeed a compleat and unanswerable argument against those sophists who contend for the necessity of Political Evil and of permitting and encouraging Vice in certain de∣grees as they shall think fit for state occasions    Can we claim a  better  RIGHT to the en∣slaved Negroes in the British Colonies  than the several antient Nations above∣mentioned had to their Captive Ene∣mies  whom God had delivered into their hands And yet we find they were made mutual Instruments of De∣struction to each other on that very ac∣count  Israel  I mean the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes was the Scourge of  Judah Judah  of  Israel Syria  was the Scourge of both as also were  Edom Moab  and  Ammon  and  Assyria  was the Scourge of them all  Egypt  again was the Scourge of  Assyria  and  Assyria  under a Babylonish King became afterwards the severe Scourge and Retaliator of Evils upon  Egypt  The opulent  Tyre  with her princely

uncharitable  Crime  without an equal share of  Retribution  These examples clearly demonstrate the necessity of observing the Apostle's Advice  If ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye are not con∣sumed one of another  Gal v which is a striking representation of the EXTREME DANGER of  Oppression  and  the Want of Brotherly Lover  for surely no  Oppression  can be more noto∣rious and  biting  than that of  enslaving  others nor can the DANGER of being  "consumed one of another"  according to the Apostle's express words be more apparent than in the FREQUENT IN∣SURRECTIONS which have ever been the unavoidable consequences of Slave∣ry  See an Extract from Mr Morgan's Book intitled  "A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery"  c printed at the end of this Tract  Can we reasonably expect that the only exception to God's general rule of  National Vengeance  and  Retribu∣tion  upon the Authors of  Slavery and Oppression  shall be in favour of GREAT BRITAIN which hath so notoriously exceeded all other Nations in the mul∣tiplicity and largeness of her dealings in the MANTRADE  Long before this additional load of  national  guilt had arrived at any considerable height the na∣tion  was supposed to be under a very dangerous bur∣then of Sin which my Grandfather testified before the House of Commons  we are not that innocent virtuous pious people  said he  that may cer∣tainly reckon upon God's favour and think our∣selves in all cases sure of his protection For if the Doctrine I have now been insisting on to you be true Doctrine then we of this nation can but en∣tertain very small  hopes of being  HAPPY  and  PROS∣PEROUS  Nay we cannot but apprchend  MISERY  and  RUIN  and desolation to ourselves unless God be a∣bundantly more merciful to us than we deserve And there can be no way to prevail with him to be so but an  UNIVERSAL HUMILIATION  and  REPENTANCE  and this is the application I desire to make of the point I have been now treating of  With the same view and desire exactly is the present address laid before the public though the author was not aware when the tract was sent to the press that his ancestor had borne such ample public testimony to the truth of the same doctrine concerning the  Law of National Retribution  as he has since cited from his works  If the measure of God's dealing with  NATIONS  be always according to the moral state of them if their good fortunes be dealt out to them according to their virtues and Judgements be inflicted upon them accord∣ing to their provoking God by their Sins as we have said good Lord what a lamentable prospect have  WE OF THIS KINGDOM  of what may come upon us and what infinite reason have we thereupon immediately  to try all the ways that are possible of making our peace with God that so  INIQUITY MAY NOT BE OUR RUIN  Archbp Sharp's Sermons Vol Serm p th edit But the horrible abomination of the SlaveTrade was only in its infancy when my Grandfather made this declaration and the baneful tendency of it perhaps was hardly known to him or he would certainly have entered a zealous and parti∣cular protest against it With such an  accumulated load of national Guilt  the necessity of a public humilia∣tion and repentance is become more and more obvious especially as the long foreseen  Vengeance of the Al∣mighty  seems now ready to burst upon our heads let us therefore earnestly join in the necessary reformation  "that so iniquity may not be our Ruin"  that ini∣quitous  and oppressive business of pur∣chasing our poor unhappy  African  Bro∣thers  and Sisters    Men Women and Children    and then forcibly trans∣porting them  "far from their border"  even to the opposite side almost of this terrestrial Globe  What is this my Countrymen but a notorious aggravation of that very crime for which the  Vengeance  and  Re∣tribution  of the ALMIGHTY was poured on the heads of the ancient Tyrian Merchants abovementioned They  SOLD the Captive Jews to the Grecians  a neighbouring People  but YE HAVE SOLD the poor  Africans  who never of∣fended you to  the very distant Inhabitants of America and the West Indies  THAT YE MIGHT REMOVE THEM FAR  far indeed "FROM THEIR BOR∣DER" Have we not reason to expect the same awful Decree of the Divine Justice which immediately follows these words  "Behold I will raise them"  i e the Slaves  out of the place  WHI∣THER YE HAVE SOLD THEM  and will return your Recompence upon your own head  AND I WILL SELL YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS  c  Joel iii Have we not ample reason to fear that God will make of this Nation in proportion to the mag∣nitude of our guilt in  Slavedealing  a tremendous Example of RETRIBUTION to deter other Nations from offending his  Eternal  JUSTICE if a sincere and  speedy  national  Repentance does not avert the Evil"THE LORD" JE∣HOVAH  IS HIS NAME  that strength∣ened the  SPOILED  against the  STRONG  so that the  SPOILED  shall come against the  FORTRESS  Amos v That saith  They shall  SPOIL  those that  SPOILED  them  Ezek xxxix This latter Sentence of RETRI∣BUTION as well as the first was de∣nounced indeed against the  Oppressors  of the ISRAELITES but yet the  Justice  of it is equally applicable to the unpro∣voked  Oppressors of the poor Africans  We know not how soon a just  national Retribution  may overtake us how soon the Almighty may think fit to recom∣pense the British Nation  according to the work of their own hands  or how soon he may withdraw his light from us and leave us involved in the same deplorable ignorance that the  Afri∣cans  themselves unhappily fell into very  soon after they perverted the Truth and Intention of the Gospel which was once planted and that very early even in the internal parts of their vast Continent as I have elsewhere shewn See my Tract on the just Limitation of Slavery pages to This la∣mentable Fall of  Africa  'That AFRICA' said he  which is not now more fruitful of Monsters than it was once of ex∣cellently wise and learned men that AFRICA which formerly afforded us our  Clemens  our  Origen  our  Tertullian  our  Cyprian  our  Augustine  and many other extraordinary lights in the Church of God that FAMOUS AFRICA in whose soil CHRIS∣TIANITY did thrive so prodigiously and could boast of so many flourishing Churches alas IS∣NOW A WILDERNESS  The wild Boars have broken into the Vineyard and eaten it up and it brings forth nothing but Bryars and Thorns  to use the words of the Prophet And who knows but GOD MAY SUDDENLY MAKE THIS CHURCH AND NATION THIS OUR ENGLAND which Jeshurun like is  waxed fat and grown proud and has kicked against God  SUCH ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE VENGEANCE OF THIS KIND  Archbp Sharp's Sermons Vol Serm intitled Repentance the Means for averting God's Judgement th edit p Preached before the House of Commons April  was the very example by which my own Grand∣father  near a Century ago  wanting only  three years warned the  House of Com∣mons  concerning our  national Danger  But there is still one more great ex∣ample against Tyranny and Oppression which must not be omitted I mean the example of God's Vengeance against Babylon that great and terrible Scourge of all the other ancient Nations already mentioned in this Tract for as her OPPRESSIONS were more general and extensive so her Punishment is more frequently and more fully declared in Scripture  The Prophet Jeremiah denounced  the Law of Retribution  against the Baby∣lonians in the strongest terms as well in return for the cruel Slaughters they  were guilty of as for the heavy  Yoke of Bondage  with which they oppressed the Captive Israelites See chap L  De∣clare ye among the Nations  said the Prophet  and publish and set up a standard publish  and  conceal not say  BABYLON  is taken  BEL  is con∣founded  c  For out of the North there cometh up a Nation against her which shall  MAKE HER LAND DESO∣LATE  manifestly in return for the cruel DESOLATION of Judea  and none shall dwell therein  that is in Babylon  they shall remove they shall depart both Man and Beast  Jer L And to mark the  Indignation  as well as  the Cause  of it in the strongest terms by the severity of Contrast the Promise of a happy Restauration to the Captives whom they oppressed is blended with the Sentence of their own Condemnation  In those days and at that time saith the Lord the Children  of Israel shall come they and the Chil∣dren of Judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the Lord their God They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward  saying  Come and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant  that  shall not be forgotten My Peo∣ple have been lost Sheep their Shep∣herds  that is their wicked Kings see Jer xxiii  have caused them to go astray  c  All that found them  HAVE DEVOURED THEM  and their  ADVERSARIES  said We offend not because they have  SINNED AGAINST THE LORD  In like manner an Advocate for the African Trade who distinguished himself by the signature of  Mercator  hoped to remove the odium of  oppressing  the poor Africans by falsely asserting that they were descended from Canaan who was cursed by his Fa∣ther Noah  Cursed be Canaan a Servant of Servants shall he be unto his Brethren  Treatise upon the Trade from Great Britain to Africa by an African Merchant Appendix See also my Tract on the  Just Limitation of Slavery c  p wherein this Assertion of  Mercator  is answered    the Habitation of  Justice even the Lord the Hope of their Fathers  The Prophet then immediately refumes the Burthen of Babylon  Remove out of the midst of Babylon  c    Shout against her round about she hath given her hand her Foundations are fallen her Walls are thrown down for it  is THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD  take  VENGEANCE  upon her  AS SHE HATH DONE DO UNTO HER  Jer L Here the Law of Retribution is strongly marked And again in the th verse    Israel  is  a scattered Sheep the Lions have driven  him  away first the  KING OF ASSYRIA  hath devoured him and last this  NEBUCHADREZZAR KING OF BABYLON  hath broken his bones Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel Behold I will punish the  KING OF BABYLON  and his Land as I have punished the  KING OF ASSYRIA  See the ex∣ample  before quoted  And I will  BRING ISRAEL AGAIN TO HIS HA∣BITATION  c    Call together the Archers against  BABYLON  all ye that bend the bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape  RECOMPENSE HER ACCORDING TO HER WORK ACCORDING TO ALL THAT SHE HATH DONE DO UNTO HER  for she hath been  PROUD  against the Lord against the Holy One of Israel Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets  c  And a little further the principal cause of God's Anger is more particularly expressed  Thus saith the Lord of Hosts The Children of Israel and the Children of Judah  were OPPRESSED TOGETHER  and all that  TOOK THEM CAPTIVES HELD THEM FAST  they  REFUSED TO LET THEM GO  But mark ye  Slaveholders  what immediately follows  Their  REDEEMER  is  STRONG THE  LORD OF HOSTS  Jehovah of Ar∣mies is  his Name  he shall  THO∣ROUGHLY PLEAD THEIR CAUSE  that he may give rest to the Land and disquiet  THE INHABITANTS OF BA∣BYLON A SWORD IS UPON THE CHALDEANS  c  See the whole th chapter  The  Law of Retribution  is also strongly marked in the th chapter where the Prophet promises that Jehovah  will  BRING AGAIN THE CAPTIVITY OF HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL AND JUDAH  ver and  that  JACOB  shall be saved  OUT OF HIS TROUBLE ver and more especially  from  SLAVERY de∣claring as the Word of the Lord of Hosts  I will break his  YOKE FROM OFF THY NECK AND WILL BURST THY BONDS  and  STRANGERS  shall no more  SERVE THEMSELVES OF HIM  But they  SHALL SERVE THE LORD  THEIR GOD  Compare this with Levit xxv  For they are  MY SERVANTS  said the Almighty  which I brought out of the Land of Egypt they shall not be  SOLD  as  BONDMEN    and  DAVID  their King whom I will raise up unto them  This is allowed even by the Jews to be a Prophecy of the  Messiah  for in the Targum of Jona∣than it is rendered    obedient Meschiae filie David Regi suo  The Messiah is reprented under the name of  David  signifying  a Friend  in three other placestwice in Ezekiel and once in Hoseabeing the  true Friend of Mankind  whose prin∣cipal Doctrine was universal  Love  and  Goodwill towards Men  And Christ himself after explaining the necessary Doctrine of  Love  John xv to condescended to honour his followers with the recipro∣cal appellation of FRIENDS"  Ye are my  FRIENDS" said he  if ye do whatsoever I command you Hence∣forth I call you not  SERVANTS  for the  SERVANT  knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you  FRIENDS  for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made know unto you  c  Here is a clear ENFRANCHISEMENT of Christ's Household whereby we learn that TRUE CHRISTIAN LIBERTY is acquired by the  Knowledge of  GOD'S WILL re∣vealed to us by Christ if we sincerely ask the assist∣ance of the HOLY SPIRIT that we may act accord∣ingly then shall we be  Friends indeed    See verses and  And he represents God as speaking to the whole Nation under the personal figure of their Ancestor the Patriarch JACOB saying  I am with thee saith the Lord to save thee though I make  A FULL END OF ALL NATIONS  whi∣ther I have scattered thee yet will I not  MAKE A FULL END OF THEE  shewing that Israel was still the pecu∣liar People of God  but I will cor∣rect thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished  ver And also after some further expostula∣tion concerning the grievous affliction of that peculiar People and the cause of it the Prophet proceeds in the th verse to declare the Divine Judgement of a severe RETRIBUTION against the Enemies of JACOB  Therefore all they that  DEVOUR THEE  shall be  DE∣VOURED  and all thine Adversaries every one of them shall  GO INTO CAPTIVITY  and they that  SPOIL  THEE  shall be  A SPOIL  and all that  PREY UPON THEE  will I give  FOR A PREY  for I will restore health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds saith the Lord because they called thee  AN OUTCAST  As it was manifestly an offence in the sight of God to call Israel an OUTCAST  during the former  DE∣SOLATION it certanily  is not less so now  tho' that devoted People is at present  dispersed over the face of all the Earth  without a single Acre of  National  Terri∣tory in any one place for the scriptures gives us am∣ple assurance of a much more glorious  Return of the Jews  than that from  Babylon  and the Apostle to the Gentiles has expressly declared that  God hath not  CAST AWAY  his people which he fore knew  Rom xi And in the th verse he says  through  THEIR FALL  Salvation is come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to Jealousy Now  says he  if the  FALL OF THEM  be the  RICHES OF THE WORLD  and  THE DIMINISHING  of  THEM  the  RICHES OF THE GENTILES HOW MUCH MORE THEIR FULNESS  c and again in the th verse  IF THE CASTING AWAY  of them be the re∣conciling of the World what shall the  RECEIVING OF THEM BE BUT LIFE FROM THE DEAD  And the apostle also warns us NOT  to boast against the Branches of that Mystical Olive Tree  on which the Wild Olive Tree of the Gentiles is grafted  "for"  says he  if God spared not the  NATURAL BRANCHES  the Israelites  take heed lest he  ALSO "SPARE NOT THEE"and indeed we have the greatest reason to acknowledge the great mercy of God in sparing this nation hitherto if we consider the many bloody persecutions of the Jews in this King∣dom during the dark days of POPISH IGNORANCE many particulars of which may be seen in Tovey's  Anglia Judaica  or perhaps we may say that many of the bloody Civil Wars and other  National Ca∣lamities  that have already distressed  this Nation  may have been inflicted on our ancestors for their  unmerciful Treatment  of these wandering STRAN∣GERS in  persecuting banishing and even  MUR∣DERING  them  in multitudes for the sake of plunder∣ing and robbing them of their wealth Let us re∣member the confident hope of the Apostle that the Israelites shall be again grafted into their own Olive Tree  "for"  says he  God is able to graff them in again For if thou wert cut out of the  OLIVETREE  which is  WILD BY NATURE  and wert  GRAFFED  contrary to nature into a  GOOD OLIVE TREE  how much more shall these which be  THE NATURAL BRANCHES  be  GRAFFED INTO THEIR OWN OLIVE TREE  and he adds  for I wou'd not  Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that  BLIND∣NESS IN PART  is happened to  ISRAEL  until the  FUL∣NESS OF THE GENTILES BE COME IN  And so shall  ALL ISRAEL  be saved as it is writtenThere shall come out of Sion the Deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from  JACOB  For this is my Co∣venant with them when I shall take away their Sins  c See the whole chapter  saying  This  is  Zion whom no man seeketh after  c  In the th chapter also a severe  Re∣tribution  is denounced expressly against  "the King of Babylon"  and  the Land of the Chaldeans  to confirm all that had been foretold by  Jeremiah    I will make it  viz Babylon or the Land of the Chaldeans  perpetual Desolations And I will bring upon that Land all my Words which I have pronounced against it  even  all  that is  written in this Book which Jere∣miah hath prophesied against all the Na∣tions For many Nations and great Kings shall serve themselves of them also  that is by reducing  them also  to Slavery and Bondage  and I will recompense them  now mark God's Law of Retribution  according  to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands  Jer xxv  And even the Prophet Isaiah who lived long before Jeremiah also de∣nounced a RETRIBUTION IN KIND against BABYLON in as plain and intel∣ligible a stile as if he had been relating the history of things past though the time of delivering the Prophecy was  long before  the CAPTIVITY of JUDAH and consequently  long before  even the OFFENCE  was committed  for which the RETRIBUTION  was denounced  See chap  "For the Lord"  said Isaiah  will have mercy on Jacob and will yet  CHOOSE ISRAEL  and set them in their own Land  this observe was foretold long before they were re∣moved from it  and the Strangers shall be joined with them  this was the case particularly of the  Edomites  after the return from the Babylonish Captivity  and they shall cleave to the House of  JACOB  c    And they shall take them  CAPTIVES WHOSE CAPTIVES THEY WERE  and they shall rule over  THEIR OPPRESSORS  This is a manifest RETRIBUTION IN KIND  And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee  Israel  rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the  HARD BON∣DAGE  wherein thou wast made to  SERVE  that thou shalt take up this proverb against the  KING OF BABY∣LON  and say How hath  THE OP∣PRESSOR CEASED  The Lord hath broken the Staff of the Wicked  and  the Sceptre of the Rulers He who  SMOTE THE PEOPLE  in wrath with  A CONTINUAL STROKE  he that  RULED THE NATIONS IN ANGER  is persecuted and none hindereth  c  Isaiah xiv  They that see  thee shall narrowly look upon thee  and  consider thee  saying is  this the Man that made the Earth to trem∣ble that did shake Kingdoms  that  made the World as a Wilderness and destroyed the Cities thereof  that OPENED NOT THE HOUSE OF HIS PRISONERS  c  Ver Mark this ye hardened  Slaveholders  who are so  tenacious  of that usurped and pretended property which ye claim in the Persons of your Fellow Men Will ye also refuse to OPEN THE HOUSE OF YOUR PRISONERS Remember that the same God still reigns and never changes If he spared not the first and most glorious Monarchy upon Earth he surely will not spare you unless ye sincerely repent and reform God's Vengeance against Babylon was exe∣cuted expressly on account of the  heavy Yoke of Bondage  with which they op∣pressed their Captives The Judge∣ment  and the Denunciation of it was the more exemplary as it was a JUDGEMENT IN KINDa manifest RE∣TRIBUTION OF SLAVERY The Lan∣guage is  awful  and  majestic  as well as truly  poetical  for the condemned  Nation  is figuratively represented under the similitude of a delicate young Woman or Virgin whereby the  national  Judge∣ment is rendered as it were  personal  and consequently much more striking and affecting than it could have been in any other way  "Come down"  said the Prophet Isaiah chap xlvii  and sit in the dust  O VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF BABYLON SIT ON THE GROUND  that is to denote her future abject state when deprived of  Royalty    there is  no Throne  O DAUGHTER OF THE CHALDEANS  for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate  The Prophet then proceeds to describe the deplorable state  of the most ABJECT SLAVES which was now to be transferred from the  Sufferers  to the  Slaveholders  themselves He still addresses himself to the Imperial City under the simile of a Woman and gives that  "Lady of Kingdoms"  See ver    Sit thou silent and get thee into darkness  O DAUGHTER  of the Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called  THE LADY OF KING∣DOMS  a humiliating information of her future employment and condition in SLAVERY  Take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh  PASS OVER THE RIVERS  Thy nakedness shall be un∣covered yea thy shame shall be seen  I WILL TAKE VENGEANCE  I will not meet  thee as  a man  c  The Prophet after giving assurance to Israel that Jehovah the Holy One of Israel would be their REDEEMER that is a REDEEMER from SLAVERY both  tem∣poral  and  spiritual  proceeds to declare the reason of God's  severe Vengeance  against BABYLON in the th verse  I was wroth with my People I have polluted mine Inheritance and given them into  THINE HAND  thou didst shew them  NO MERCY  upon the Ancient hast thou  VERY HEAVILY LAID THY YOKE  And thou saidst I shall be a Lady for ever  so  that thou didst not lay these  things  to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of it Therefore hear now this thou  that art  given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly  c    These two things shall come to thee  IN A MOMENT IN ONE DAY  the loss of Children and Widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy Sorceries  and  for the great abun∣dance of thine Enchantments For thou hast trusted in thy Wickedness thou hast said None seeth me Thy Wisdom and  thy Knowledge it hath perverted thee  Mark this ye little Philosophers and sophistical Deists who even make it a question whether there be such a thing as Providence in the World  And thou hast said in thine heart I  am  and none else beside me Therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and  DESOLATION  shall come upon thee  SUDDENLY  Compare this with the aboverecited passage in the th verse  These two things shall come to thee  IN A MOMENT IN ONE DAY  c  The same SUDDEN and UNEXPECTED VENGEANCE is also strongly described by Jeremiah  "Babylon"  said he in the spirit of Prophecy  is  SUDDENLY FALLEN AND DESTROYED HOWL FOR HER  c  Chap li This exemplary VENGEANCE was denounced expressly on account of the  Babylonian  TYRANNY  over the Jewish  CAPTIVES for in a pre∣ceding verse the latter are comforted and informed of the RETRIBUTION determined against  babylon "For Israel hath not been forsaken"  said the Prophet  nor Judah of his God of the Lord of Hosts though their Land was filled with Sin against the Holy One of Israel Flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver every man his soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is  THE TIME  of the  LORD'S VENGEANCE  he will render unto her  A RECOMPENCE  Also in the th verse of the same chapter the RETRIBUTION is clearly declared  I will render unto Babylon and to all the Inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight saith the Lord  c  And in the th verse also  As Babylon  hath caused  the slain of Israel to fall so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the Earth  c    which  thou shalt not know Stand now with thine Inchantments and with the multitude of thy Sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail Thou art wearied with the multitude of thy Councils Let now the Astrologers the Stargazers  for Babylon was famous for her very ancient Royal Observatory  the monthly Prognosticators stand up and save thee from  these things  that shall come upon thee Behold they shall be as stubble the  FIRE  shall  BURN  THEM  they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the  FLAME  c  Isaiah xlvii  The Babylonians were Worshippers of  Fire  so that the abovementioned Denunciation of  Fiery Vengeance  seems to be peculiarly applicable and it is remarkable that the King of Babylon had recourse to his Astrologers  The King cried aloud to bring in the Astro∣logers the Chaldeans and the Soothsayers  c viz  to interpret the handwriting on the wall men∣tioned in the Book of Daniel chap v But they were ignorant of their approaching destruction  agreeable to this Prophecy in the dreadful night when the  Medes and Persians  were to enter his Capital City for these Nations were expressly called upon by name as the appointed Instru∣ments of GOD'S VENGEANCE  "  Make bright the  ARROWS" for the Medes and Persians were famous Archers  gather the shields the Lord hath raised up the Spirit of the Kings  OF THE MEDES  for his device  is  against  BABYLON  to destroy it because it  is  the  VEN∣GEANCE OF THE LORD THE VENGEANCE OF HIS TEMPLE  Jer li And in the th verse the Prophet expressly names the Kingdoms from whence the several Armies that came with the MEDES and PERSIANS were raised  Set ye up a standard in the Land blow the trumpet among the Nations prepare the Nations against her call together against her the Kingdoms of  ARARAT    viz  in the neigh∣bourhood of Armenia "MINNI" or AramMinni the  Armenians  themselves "  and  ASHKENAZ"  viz  the Nations descended from the eldest Son of  Gomer  who were nearly allied in blood to the  Medes

afterwards declared to be CYRUS  cause the  HORSES  to come up as the rough Caterpillars  the Persians as also the Parthians and after them the Turks likewise were ever famous for their Cavalry  prepare against her the Nations with the Kings of the  MEDES  the Captains thereof and all the Rulers thereof and all the Land of his Dominion  c  And in ver he says  For the Spoilers  SHALL COME UNTO HER FROM THE NORTH  The Prophet Isaiah also distinctly pointed out the same Instruments of GOD'S VENGEANCE against  Babylon    Lift ye up the Banner  upon  THE HIGH MOUNTAIN  exalt the voice unto them  c  describing the first mustering of the confederate Nations against the overgrown tyrannical power of  Babylon    The noise of a multitude  IN THE MOUNTAINS  probably meaning the Mountains of Ararat  c  mentioned by Jeremiah  like as of a great People a tumultuous noise of the Kingdoms of Nations gathered together  THE LORD OF HOSTS    viz  Jehovah of Armies  mustereth the Host of the Battle  Here we see the proper meaning of the Lord of Hosts  They come from a far Country from the end of Heaven  even  the Lord and the Weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land c Be∣hold I will stir up the  MEDES  against them which shall not regard Silver and  as for  Gold they shall not delight in it  Their  Bows also  for the Medes were eminent Archers  shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their Eye shall not spare the Chil∣dren And  BABYLON  the Glory of Kingdoms the beauty of the Chaldees excellency shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah  c Chap xiii Again in st chapter the same Prophet dis∣tinctly names the  Medes  and  Persians  to be the instru∣ments of  God's retribution  against BABYLON  A grievous Vision is declared unto me The Treacherous Dealer dealeth treacherously and the Spoiler spoileth Go up  O ELAM  for the  Persians  were descend∣ed  from the Patriarch  Elam  the Son of Shem men∣tioned in Genesis x as Josephus observes in his Antiq Lib i c    Besiege  O ME∣DIA  all the sighing thereof have I made to cease Therefore are my loins filled with pain  the Pro∣phet seems to describe the consternation of the King of Babylon just before his destruction  Pangs have taken hold upon me as the Pangs of a Woman that travaileth  I WAS BOWED DOWN AT THE HEAR∣ING of it  viz of Daniel's interpretation of the handwriting upon the wall of the Banquetting House "  I was dismayed at the seeing  of it" pro∣bably meaning the miraculous appearance of the hand which wrote  My heart  PANTED  fearfulness af∣frighted me  Isaiah xxi The extreme fear which really possessed the King of Babylon in that dreadful time of retribution is strongly described by Daniel who was an eyewitness of it Chap v viz  That the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another  The  Medes  and  Persians  and their associates are also described by  Jeremiah  as well as the extreme fear and anguish of the King of Babylon on hearing the report of them  "Behold"  said the Prophet  a people shall come  FROM THE NORTH  Armenia Media c being to the north of Mesopotamia or Ba∣bylonia  and a great nation and many Kings shall be  raised up from the coasts of the earth They shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea  AND THEY SHALL RIDE UPON HORSES  See the re∣mark above concerning the  Pensian  Cavalry the Per∣sians having obtained that very name on account of their character as horsemen for  Perse  or  Pheresh  signifies a Horseman as well as  Parth  or  Phereth    every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee O Daughter of Babylon The King of Babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands waxed feeble Anguish took hold of him and Pangs as of a Woman in Travail  c Chap l    and the horrors of that fatal night were plainly foretold  The night of my  pleasure  says the Prophet mani∣festly referring to the impious midnight  carousal mentioned by Daniel by He∣rodotus and Xenophon  hath he  turned into  FEAR  unto me  the ex∣cess of which is described in the former verses quoted in the preceding Note  PREPARE THE TABLE  watch in the  WATCHTOWER  For the Babylonians trusted in their  Walls  and  Towers  as appears also by  Jeremiah  's prophecy on the same occasion  Set up the Standard upon the Walls of Babylonmake the watch strong set up the Watchmen prepare the ambushes  c Jer li  EAT DRINK ARISE YE PRINCES  It appears by the account of Xenophon that when  Gobryas  and his men first entered  the Palace  in that  fatal night  they found the King and his Princes assembled and the King standing with a drawn scy∣mitar in his hand ready to oppose them notwith∣standing his extreme consternation just before on hearing the miraculous prediction of his fate that he might endeavour to persuade his  Princes  to stand by him and resist the Enemy though indeed the learned Vitringa supposes that the words  arise ye Princes and anoint the shield  refer to the Speech of Cyrus just before the assault recorded likewise by XenophonA    c  and an∣oint the shield  c  Isaiah xxi  The Prophet Jeremiah also alludes to the same fatal Babylonian supper which seems to have been intended as a  Festivity  to the honour of their False Deities  We read in Daniel v that  they  DRANK WINE  and  PRAISED THE GODS OF GOLD  and  OF SILVER  of brass of iron of wood and of stone  in order to insure suc∣cess against the Besiegers  In their heat  or in their anger that is against their Enemies in the War  I will make their  FEASTS  and I will make them  DRUNKEN  that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the Lord I will bring  them down  LIKE LAMBS  to the slaugh∣ter  that is without opposition or re∣sistance on their part  Which is described also in the th verse of "the same chapter  The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight

the  manner of bringing about  this VENGE∣ANCE as well as the REASON of it is further described in the same chapter  For the Lord God of  RECOM∣PENCES  said the Prophet ver  shall surely  REQUITE  And

the folk in the fire and they shall be weary  Jer li  The Armies of God's Wrath upon Babylon were led by  Cyrus  who was expressly called upon  by name  and ap∣pointed to this service  about two hun∣dred years before he was born  Clank's Annotations    and Deliverance also by his hand from Bondage was promised at the same time to the Jews even many years before  they were carried into Captivity  Remember these O Jacob and Israel for thou  art  my Servant I have formed thee thou  art  my Servant O Israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for I have re∣deemed thee  that is from the Baby∣lonish Slavery as the remainder of the chapter will shew  Sing O ye Hea∣vens for the Lord hath done  it  shout ye lower parts of the Earth break forth into singing ye Mountains O Forest and every Tree therein for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob  If the Redemption of the Jews even from Temporal Slavery was esteemed a subject of Joy and Triumph to the Universe Heaven and Earth how much more will the world have cause to rejoice when the Lord shall redeem them also from that  spiritual Slavery  and  hardness of heart  in which they remain at present how much more interesting to all the world will be their last  great and glorious return to their Redeemer  "If the fall of them" said the Apostle Paul  be the  riches of the world  and the diminish∣ing of them the Riches of the Gentiles  how much more their fulness  Romans xi and he tells us again in the th verse  That Blindness in part

upon  ALL    and glorified himself in Israel Thus saith the Lord  THY REDEEMER  and he that formed thee from the Womb I  am  the  LORD  Jehovah  that maketh all  things  that stretcheth forth the Heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the Earth by myself that frus∣trateth the Tokens of the Lyars and maketh Diviners mad that turneth Wise  Men  backward and maketh their Knowledge foolish  referring probably to the unprofitable Sciences and vain Politics of the Chaldeans  that confirmeth the Word of his Servant and performeth the Counsel of his Mes∣sengers  that saith to  JERUSALEM THOU SHALT BE

Targum BABEL is meant  Be  DRY  and I will  DRY UP  thy Rivers  most probably alluding to the success∣ful stratagem of Cyrus to  dry up the Rivers  by altering their Course where∣by he gained an unsuspected passage into the City through the emptied Channels  "In the language of the Prophets" says Mr Cruden in his Concordance  Waters  often de∣note a great multitude of  people  and this pro∣phecy perhaps might allude to the vast  conflux  of peo∣ple at Babylon that God would  dry them  up by mak∣ing the place desolate but yet the literal sense is cer∣tainly to be preferred because it seems to have had a literal accomplishment in the successful stratagem of Cyrus abovementioned  Certè de Babylone est sermo  says the learned Forerius  per quam fluebant flumina Tigris Euphrates

further re∣vealed  Thus saith the Lord to his Anointed to  CYRUS  whose right hand I have holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings  see the former account concerning the extreme fear of the King of Babylon and his Princes  to  OPEN  before him  THE TWOLEAVED GATES  and  THE GATES SHALL  NOT BE SHUT  Compare this with Zenophon's Account of the Palace Gates being OPENED on the first Alarm  I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight I will break in pieces the Gates of Brass and cut in sunder the Bars of Iron and I will give thee the Treasures of Darkness and hidden riches of Secret places  al∣luding probably to the immense quan∣tities of Gold in the secret Chapels of the Babylonish Idols within the great ancient  Herodotus who was at Babylon

great propriety be called  The "hidden riches of secret places"  and they were also very properly called  Treasures of Darkness  being dedicated to  Demons  for the greatest part of the gold was worked up into the va∣rious imaginary forms of the false Deities There was one Golden Idol of Jupiter of an immense size  Tower  that thou mayest know that I the Lord which call  thee  BY THY NAME am  the God of Is∣rael  And in the next verse the Prophet assigns the reason why the Al∣mighty thus called upon CYRUS viz  for Jacob my Servant's sake and Is∣rael mine elect I have even called thee  BY THY NAME  I have  SURNAMED THEE  though thou hast not known me I  am  the Lord  or rather  I  am JEHOVAH  and  there is  none else  there is  no God beside me I girded thee  or strengthened thee  though thou hast not known me  c and God's PURPOSE in raising up CYRUS is still more clearly declared in the th verse  I have raised him up in  RIGHTE∣OUSNESS  and I will  DIRECT ALL HIS WAYS  he shall  BUILD MY CITY  and  HE SHALL LET GO MY CAP∣TIVES  mark this ye wretched Slaveholders  NOT FOR PRICE NOR REWARD  saith the Lord of Hosts  and accordingly  the Proclamation of Free∣dom  to the Jews and the Decree for re∣building the Temple were made in the first year of Cyrus See Ezra i  Now let my Readers seriously com∣pare these accounts of God's peculiar favour to CYRUS THE RESTORER OF LIBERTY with the accounts which I have already recited of GOD'S oppo∣site treatment of that man who  OPEN∣ED NOT THE HOUSE OF HIS PRI∣SONERS  Isaiah xiv  Cyrus by the Almighty was expressly called in the th chapter of Isaiah "HIS ANOINTED"  Thus saith the Lord to  HIS ANOINTED  to  CYRUS  and  literally  to his Messiah  In the Septuagint the passage is ren∣dered  and literally from thence in the Latin Vulgate  "Christo meo Cyro" to Cyrus my Christ  By Munster it is rendered  MESCHIAE SUO  hoc est  says he  Regi suo Vocatur autem  CO∣RESCH  seu  CYRUS MESCHIAS  Rex Domini quod ille ordinaverit

Bondage under the Babylonian Tyrant might justly be esteemed a Type of that future  great Restorer to universal Liberty  foretold by the same Prophet who was afterwards to  enfranchise  all Mankind from a  much worse Bondage under the Empire of Satan  The Spirit of the Lord God  is  upon me because the Lord    viz  Jehovah  HATH AN∣OINTED ME  to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to  PRO∣CLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES  and the  OPENING OF THE PRISON TO them that are BOUND  to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and  THE DAY OF VENGEANCE OF OUR GOD  c  Isaiah lxi And also in a former chapter  To open the blind eyes to  BRING OUT THE PRISONERS FROM THE PRISON and  them that sit in darkness out of the  PRISONHOUSE  c  Chap xlii This Prophecy of Isaiah that Christ should PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES was acknowledged and read  even by  CHRIST  him∣self  in the Synagogue of Nazareth on the Sabbath∣day  The Evangelist Luke gives an account of this remarkable event chap iv and seems to have blended together the two Pro∣phecies which I have recited above as neither of them singly will answer exactly the quotation he has given from Isaiah though taken together they amount very nearly to the same thing  and declared to be then  fulfilled    This day  said our Lord  is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears  But alas the greatest part of the Na∣tion obstinately and wickedly rejected that GLORIOUS FREEDOM which was then  proclaimed  whereby they drew down God's severe Vengeance upon themselves being soon after deprived even of that  temporal Inhe∣ritance  which they seemed to value above all other things after suffering the most extraordinary slaughters and calamities of an unsuccessful and de∣structive war in defence of it and of their TEMPORAL LIBERTIES And they  remain in exile  to this day a living Testimony to the Truth of Prophecy  "And when he"  Jesus  "was come near"  that is to Je∣rusalem  he beheld the City and  WEPT OVER IT  saying If thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things  which belong  unto thy peace But now they are hid from thine eyes For the days shall come upon thee that thine Enemies shall cast a Trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side    and it is very remarkable that the Romans af∣ter trying all the usual means in vain should at length be obliged to have recourse to  this method  before they could succeed    and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy Children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation  Luke xix Thus Christ  proclaimed  THE DAY OF VENGEANCE OF OUR GOD    agrecable to Isaiah's prophecy already recited in this note p  and an Example to all the Nations wherever they are dif∣persed of GOD'S VENGEANCE against the Rejecters of his divine Revelation  This spiritual  Freedom  is indeed clearly tendered to  all men  but how  many are they who for the sake of a little worldly profit are again entan∣gled in the snares and temptations of their  spiritual Enemy  and submit them∣selves to his  Bondage  How can we suppose that those men are FREE from THE MAMMON OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS who are led by the temptations of pri∣vate  interest to infringe the NATURAL RIGHTS OF MANKIND by uncharita∣bly retaining their  Fellow Men  in an  involuntary  SERVITUDE  Can any injury except that of  taking away a man's  LIFE exceed that of  taking away a man's  LIBERTY who has never offended us Can any  robbery  or  injustice  whatsoever be more atrocious than that of wearing out our  poor Bre∣thren  in a hard  involuntary service with∣out  WAGES  or  REWARD thereby con∣tinually  robbing them of the Fruit of their Labours  Have I not shewn by un∣questionable examples from Scripture that this is  a crying sin  and that the Almighty hath denounced Wo  Wo unto him that buildeth his House by Un∣righteousness and his Chambers by Wrong  that USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK  c  Jer xxii  against all such Offenders Do we not  profess to serve THE SAME GOD who so severely punished the Jews for  this very crime  And is there any just ground to hope that GOD who spared not his own peculiar People will ne∣vertheless excuse the Inhabitants of  Great Britain and her Colonies  when they are  wilfully guilty  of the same of∣fence  The whole tenour of the Scriptures teaches us that SLAVERY was ever  de∣testable in the sight of God  insomuch that it has generally been denounced and of course inflicted as the punish∣ment of the most abandoned Sinners of which I have already given a great variety of instances  Let us therefore before it is too late take warning by these tremendous examples of GOD'S VENGEANCE against this kind of  Oppression  which the Scrip∣tures  hold forth not only to  this Na∣tion  but to all the World besides The examples which I have quoted of  God's Vengeance  denounced against the  Israelites  and  Jews  for TYRANNY are not more striking than the examples of VENGEANCE denounced against the very  Instruments of that  VENGEANCE the Assyrians and Babylonians ex∣pressly on  the same account  for though the latter were mere  Instruments in God's hand  to punish the Jews  in kind  yet they were themselves subjected to the like RETRIBUTION  Nay THE VENGEANCE was de∣nounced particularly against the Chal∣deans and the cause of it also was de∣clared  long before they were guilty of the offence  as I have before remarked even while the Jews the Nation vindicated by this punishment were exercising that  Tyranny  at home for which they  were then doomed to the  Babylonian Yoke  and thereby laid the foundation for the future retaliated CAPTIVITY  of their haughty  CONQUERORS  the Chal∣deans  And have not we just reason to dread the severe VENGEANCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD when it is notorious that the  Tyranny  exercised in the British Colo∣nies is infinitely more unmerciful than that which was formerly exercised by the  Chaldeans  insomuch that the state of the Jews in their  Captivity  might be esteemed rather as  Freedom  than  Bon∣dage  when compared with the  deplo∣rable Servitude  of the wretched NEGRO SLAVES as well as of the white Ser∣vants in our Colonies  What must be the consequence of such abominable wickedness  By as much as we exceed the Assy∣rians and Babylonians in religious know∣ledge by so much more severely may we expect the hand of God upon us for our monstrous abuse of such advan∣tages  The Inhabitants of  Great Britain  and the Inhabitants of  the Colonies  seem to be almost equally guilty of  Oppression  THE COLONIES  protest  against the Iniquity of the SLAVETRADE but nevertheless continue to hold the poor wretched  Slaves  in a most  detestable Bon∣dage  GREAT BRITAIN indeed keeps  no Slaves  but publicly encourages the  Slavetrade  and contemptuously neg∣lects or rejects every petition or attempt of the  Colonists  against that notorious wickedness  The House of Burgesses in  Virginia  transmitted a very sensible and respect∣ful Petition to the King  Extracts from the minutes of the House of Burgesses in Virginia  Wednesday April st  Most Gracious Sovereign  WE your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects the Burgesses of Virginia now met in general assembly beg leave with all humility to approach your Royal Presence  The many instances of your Majesty's benevolent intentions and most gracious disposition to promote the prosperity and happiness of your subjects in the colo∣nies encouraged us to look up to the Throne and implore your Majesty's paternal assistance in avert∣ing  a Calamity of a most alarming nature  The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa hath long been considered as a trade of  great Inhumanity  and under its present en∣couragement we have too much reason to fear  will endanger the very existence of your Majesty's American dominions  We are sensible that some of your Majesty's sub∣jects in Great Britain may reap emolument from this sort of Traffic but when we consider that it greatly retards the settlement of the colonies with  more white inhabitants  and may  in time have the most destructive influence  we presume to hope that the interest of a few will be disregarded when placed in competition with the security and happiness of such numbers of your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects  Deeply imprest with these sentiments we most hum  ly beseech your Majesty to remove all those re∣straints on your Majesty's Governors of this colony which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very pernicious a commerce  Your Majesty's antient colony and dominion of Virginia hath at all times and upon every occasion been entirely devoted to your Majesty's facred person and government and we cannot forego this oppor∣tunity of renewing those assurances of the truest loy∣alty and warmest affection which we have so often with the greatest sineerity given to the best of Kings whose wisdom and goodness we esteem the surest pledge of the happiness of all his people  Resolved nemine contradicente That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said address to be presented to his Majesty  Resolved That an address be presented to his Ex∣cellency the Governor to desire that he will be pleas∣ed to transmit the address to his Majesty and to support it in such manner as he shall think most likely to pro∣mote the desirable end proposed  COPY  dated the st of April concerning the  Iniquity  Inhumanity  and  destructive Influence  of the AFRICAN SLAVETRADE to which  not the least Answer hath yet been re∣turned  The Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of  Somerset  in  New Jersey  also through their  regard to the civil and  RELIGIOUS  Interest of the Country and the established Rights of Mankind  presented to the Governor Council and Representatives of that Province a very seasonable Testimony against that  wicked  Traffic which has Slavery for it's object  praying them to  provide against the future Importation of Slaves into that Colony  and  to enable such persons as shall chuse it to manumit their  SLAVES  upon equitable Principles to the Owners and the Public  c  To the Governor Council and Represen∣tatives of the Province of New Jersey in General Assembly met  The Petition of sundry Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of Somerset  Respectfully sheweth  THAT your Petitioners influenced with an equal regard to the civil and religious interests of this Pro∣vince and the established Rights of Mankind have with concern often viewed that Traffic which has  Slavery  for it's object in a light very  unfriendly  to both and it has afforded pleasure to observe the liberal advances which of late have been made among all ranks of people towards the discountenance of that Trade and promotion of Justice to those who have thereby been deprived of their  Liberty  Hence your Petitioners are induced to address the Legisla∣ture and to request that a subject so important may receive that attention which it deserves Your Peti∣tioners also beg that you will not only provide against the future importation of Slaves into this Colony by such ways as you may think best but to enable such persons as shall chuse it to manumit them by making them useful and happy upon equitable principles to the Owners and the Public as in your wisdom may appear most conducive to those good ends And your Petitioners shall pray  c    Another Petition upon the like benevo∣lent principles was presented to the same Assembly by  divers Inhabitants of the County of  ESSEX  in the said Province  wherein they also signified their dis∣satisfaction concerning  an Act of As∣sembly in force for preventing the manu∣mitting  and setting free any Negro Slave  c whereby many  are obliged to keep their Fellow Men in a Slavery to them unlawful and contrary to their Christian Principles  c  And they exhort the Assembly  to obtain an alteration of his Majesty's Instruction to the Governor relating to the African Trade  c  To the Honourable House of Representa∣tives now sitting at Burlington in the Province of New Jersey  The humble Petition of divers Inhabitants of the County of Essex in the said Province sheweth  THAT many of his Majesty's loyal subjects in this Province observe with uneasiness the great increase of negro slaves from the coast of Africa which is con∣sidered not only as preventative of the importation and increase of white servants and labourers by which the present extravagant price of labour would be pro∣portionably lessened but also as laying a foundation of that which may hereafter prove dangerous to Go∣vernment and subversive of the liberties of the peo∣ple it being justly observed  That slaves are the natural enemies of society and their numbers must always be dangerous  It is also with dissatisfac∣tion that some of the inhabitants of this province ob∣serve an Act of Assembly in force for preventing the manumitting and setting free any negro slave however healthy and able to earn his or her living without such terms as many are wholly unable to and others cannot without great difficulty comply with whereby they are obliged to keep their fellow men in a slavery to them unlawful and contrary to their Christian principles In order therefore to remedy these growing evils your petitioners humbly pray this Honourable House that they would take such measures as to them in their wisdom may seem meet to obtain an alteration of his Majesty's Instruction to his Excellency the Governor relating to the African trade so that his Excellency may be at liberty to con∣sent to such laws for the preventing the future im∣portation of negro slaves into this province as to the Legislature may appear just and reasonable And also that the Act of Assembly relating to the manumitting of negro slaves may be repealed and the inhabitants of this province allowed by law to set free any of their negro slaves who shall appear to some proper judi∣cature to be able of body and sound in mind and under a certain age to be fixed by this Honourable House or under such other reasonable restrictions as to the Legislature may seem just and reasonableAnd your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray  A number also  of the Inhabitants of the City and County of  Philadelphia  bore the like testimony  against the African Trade in a pathetic and earnest Petition to their Provincial Assembly wherein they take notice of the example set them by the Province of  Virginia  in petitioning the King  from a deep sensibility of the danger and pernicious consequences which will be attendant on a Continuation of this most iniquitous Traffic  To the Representatives of the Freemen of the Province of Pennsylvania in Assembly met  The Petition of a number of the Inhabitants of the City and County of Philadelphia  Respectfully sheweth  THAT the importation of the natives of Guinea to be sold and used as slaves in the provinces and islands of the British dominions in America has long been an occasion of deep concern to a great number of the Inhabitants of this province as well on account of its inconsistency with the whole tenor of the Christian religion as because of the evil in∣fluence it has on the religious and moral conduct of the people and the dreadful consequence which it is to be feared will one day attend in those parts where it prevails  We are the more encouraged to lay this important object before you as we understand some of the colo∣nies have been led into serious consideration as well of the iniquity of the practice as of the dangerous situation some of them are in particularly the pro∣vince of  Virginia  whose House of Burgesses has lately  petitioned the King  from a deep sensibility of the danger and pernicious consequences which will be attendant on a continuation of this MOST INI∣QUITOUS TRAFFICK  We your petitioners therefore most earnestly be∣seech you to take this matter which we apprehend to be of the utmost consequence to the welfare and safety of the British colonies under your most serious consideration and to use your utmost endeavours with the other colonies in making such representations to the King as to you may appear most effectual towards putting a stop to this mighty evil"  Signed by about two hundred persons amongst whom were the provost of the academy and three other clergymen of the church of England being all that are in this city sive Presbyterian Clergymen and four other Ministers the rest respectable Inha∣bitants  But the As∣sembly  being desirous first to know what reception the abovementioned neg∣lected  Virginian  Petition had met with at Court postponed their address to the Throne and instead of it transmitted  an Act of Assembly for the King's  As∣sent  whereby they laid a heavy duty on the head of every Slave that should be  imported  amounting almost to a pro∣hibition of the  iniquitous Traffic  but this seasonable attempt to discourage  the crying national sin  met with a very cold reception it seems on this side of the At∣lantic and the Bill was absolutely  re∣jected  so that the  horrid  Guilt of per∣sisting in that  monstrous Wickedness  must rest on this side of the Atlantic Is thisto  execute Judgement and righteous∣ness  Is this to  deliver the  SPOILED  out of the hand of the  OPPRESSOR  Is this to  "do no wrong"  to  do no violence to the  STRANGER  Does not the same God who warned the  impolitic Zedekiah  by the mouth of his Prophet also equally warn us by  the written word  which he hath given  to us  for doctrine for reproof for cor∣rection for instruction in righteousness  Tim iii  Does he not equally warn us by these everlasting Records of his tremendous Judgements and dreadful VENGEANCE even against his own  peculiar people  FOR  all these Things happened unto them for ensamples  as I have before observed  and they are written for our admonition upon whom the Ends of the World are come  Cor x  And yet with all these spiritual ad∣vantages I fear we far exceed the Jews in the enormity and multitude of our  National Oppressions  how then shall we escape the just Vengeance of God if we persevere in these inhuman prac∣tices Is this the return we make to God for the Blessing of a Christian Edu∣cation  Surely  he hath expected better thing of us  Have we not just reason to fear that he will condemn this nation as he did the Jews of old saying  he looked for  JUDGEMENT  but behold  OPPRESSION  for  RIGHTEOUSNESS  but behold a  CRY  Isaiah v  As God never changes it is impossi∣ble that this nation should escape his  just retribution  and still persist in violat∣ing  the natural Rights  of mankind  Reflect my Countrymen for a mo∣ment upon the present state of those enor∣mous national Transgressions the  Afri∣can Slave Trade  encouraged  in  GREAT BRITAIN and the  toleration of Slavery  in THE BRITISH COLONIES and you will readily perceive that we must stand  condemned  even if we  judge ourselves  and how then shall we appear before  that Righteous  Judge  who is no re∣specter of persons How can we hope to escape the DIVINE VENGEANCE when we know that the Almighty hath even  bound himself  with a most solemn oath never to forget  any such acts of  OP∣PRESSION  The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob  SURELY  I will never forget any of their works  or rather  "all their works"  amongst which the SLAVETRADE in particular is expressly mentioned in the preceding verse  viz  buying the Poor for Silver  c  And then he condescends  to appeal  as I before re∣marked to  human Judgement  concern∣ing the propriety or rather the ne∣cessity and certainty of the Divine Vengeance for such National Wicked∣ness  Shall not the Land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein  Amos viii And in  like manner by the Prophet Jermiah  Shall I not visit for these things Shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this  Chap v These Judge∣ments indeed were denounced against the  Jews  but surely common sense must teach us that they are equally ap∣plicable at home that is  on such a Nation  AS THIS  my Countrymen  But there is still a way to escape if my Countrymen have but grace to take warning And therefore to the un∣questionable Examples of GOD's  Retri∣bution  and  Vengeance  which I have al∣ready given let me add before I con∣clude on very remarkable Example of GOD's  Vengeance  for  National Op∣pression  being actually  averted  by the seasonable interposition of  a few indivi∣duals  who procured the  dismission  and  enfranchisement  of a large body of poor  enslaved people  and thereby appeased the  denounced  Wrath of our merciful God  In the beginning of the th chapter of the second Book of Chronicles an account is given of the abominable  Ido∣latry  and Wickedness of Ahaz King of Judah  who  even  burned his Chil∣dren in the Fire  and by that super∣lative degree of  Uncharitableness  and  In∣humanity  demonstrated a voluntary sub∣mission to that  heavy Yoke of Bondage  under the  Grand Spiritual Enemy of Man∣kind  from which the  Almighty Protector  of the Creation had so gloriously deli∣vered his Ancestors  after the abomi∣nations  says the Text  of the Hea∣then whom the Lord had cast out be∣fore the Children of Israel He sacri∣ficed also and burned incense in the high places and on the hills and under every  green tree Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the King of  SYRIA  and they smote him and  CARRIED AWAY A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THEM CAPTIVES  and brought  them  to  DAMASCUS  And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of  ISRAEL  who smote him with a great slaughter for  PEKAH  the King of Israel  the Son of  RE∣MALIAH  slew in Judah  AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND IN ONE DAY  all valiant men because  THEY HAD FORSAKEN THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS  And  ZICHRI  a mighty man of Ephraim slew  MAA∣SEIAH THE KING'S SON  and  AZ∣RIKAM THE GOVERNOR OF THE HOUSE  and  ELKANAH that was NEXT TO THE KING  And the Chil∣dren of  ISRAEL  carried away captive of their Brethren  TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN SONS AND  DAUGHTERS  and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria But a Prophet of the Lord was there whose name  was ODED  and he went out before the Host that came to Samaria  tha tis as they returned from the War to Samaria with their Captives and Booty  and said unto them "Behold because the  LORD GOD  of your Fathers was wroth with Judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have  SLAIN THEM IN A RAGE that REACH∣ETH UP UNTO HEAVEN  And now  said the Prophet  ye purpose to  KEEP UNDER  the Children of Judah and Je∣rusalem for  BONDMEN  and  BONDWOMEN  unto you  but are there NOT WITH YOU EVEN WITH YOU SINS  against the  LORD  your  GOD  Now hear me therefore and  DELIVER THE CAPTIVES AGAIN  which ye have  TAKEN CAPTIVE OF YOUR  BRETHREN FOR THE FIERCE WRATH OF THE LORD is UPON YOU  Chron xxviii And may it not be said in these latter days with  equal Truth  to the Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN and HER COLONIES  Are there not with you even with you Sins against the  LORD  your  GOD  that is  are there not with you  already a sufficient number of SINS for which unless you repent you will certainly be accountable but that you must pre∣sumptuously  add to your Sins and to your Trespass  the horrid guilt of SLAVERY and OPPRESSION to hasten GOD'S VENGEANCE upon you but that you must suddenly heap up the measure of your iniquity by tolerating in your Colonies a much more grievous  Slavery  a much more numerous  Bondage  than the Israelites were ever guilty of Yet in Israel there were found four Chiefs or Noblemen  Heads of the Children  of Ephraim  who were zealous to avert God's Wrath and save their Country by a speedy restoration of the JEWISH CAPTIVES to their  natural freedom  They valiantly  STOOD UP  against them that came from the War  which were probably not only PEKAH  their King and his Princes  but also the principal Warriours of their Country see the th th and th verses  and said unto them Ye shall not bring in  THE CAPTIVES  hither  These were peremptory Terms which shewed that they were ready to risk their Lives in so good a cause and at the same time they assigned the reason of their opposition in a SOLEMN PRO∣TEST  "for whereas"  said they  we have offended against the Lord  already  ye  INTEND TO ADD more TO OUR SINS  and to  OUR TRESPASS  for our Trespass is great and  thereis  fierce wrath against Israel  Ver  This reason as well as the undaunt∣ed Resolution of those who gave it had the proper effect upon the Israelitish Soldiers who notwithstanding the ge∣neral depravity of their countrymen  still deserved the name of  MEN by de∣monstrating that they were not insen∣sible to REASON and that they thought themselves entitled though SOLDIERS to that  common Right of  HUMAN NA∣TURE  the Right of judging for them∣selves in matters of conscience  without which no man can be truely  honourable  for as soon as they heard the just remon∣strance of the four Noblemen they quitted  the Prey  and  the Plunder  a hard thing for Soldiers to submit to with∣out waiting it seems for the word of command from the King or his Princes  "So the armed men"  says the Text  lest the Captives and the Spoil before  THE PRINCES  and  ALL THE CON∣GREGATION  Ver  Here be pleased to observe is a  National Council  at once assembled in the field  the whole Power of the People    THE PRINCES AND ALL THE CON∣GREGATION  What were their Deliberations on this occasion does not appear nor their RESOLUTIONS or rather they seem to have been totally IRRESOLUTE waver∣ing between what was a RIGHT TO BE DONE and PRIVATE INTEREST as if each man was unwilling to give up his  share of the booty  and yet ashamed openly to resist the active Resolution of the four Chiefs on so charitable a cause for these four Noblemen it seems at last boldly took upon themselves the whole business  "and the men"  says the Text  "which were expressed by name"  viz the four Noblemen mentioned in the th verse  ROSE UP  and  TOOK THE CAPTIVES  and  WITH THE  SPOIL CLOTHED  all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to Jericho the City of PalmTrees to their brethren then they returned to Samaria  Thus an immediate Judgement from God upon Israel was averted by the spirited oppo∣sition of FOUR individuals against a  whole Nation  But Great Britain and her Colonies which forcibly detain more than FOUR times the number  By  an account of the European settlements in America printed in  we are informed that  there are allowed to be in  OUR WEST INDIES  at least two hundred and thirty thousand  NEGRO SLAVES  Vol p "  In  VIRGINIA" says the same author  much the larger part of the inhabitants are the NEGRO SLAVES who cannot be much fewer  than  AN HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS  they an∣nually import  says he  into the two tobacco colo∣nies between  THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE SLAVES  p and in Maryland as the same author informs us in p  the Negroes  are upwards of SIXTY THOUSAND  The number of slavesalready mentioned without reckoning the multitudes since transported to the new increasing settlements in the Grenada Islands and in the islands of Tobago Dominica and St Vincents as also exclusive of the multitudes in the two Caroli∣nas the two Floridas Georgia the two Jerseys New York c amount to THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND SOULS at the least computa∣tion so that if the multitudes actually omitted in this account were truely added the  oppression  would appear enormous The total amount of the  oppress∣ed  multitude perhaps would not fall far short of the numerous Bondage of  oppressed Israelites  which first drew down the exemplary and ever memorable VEN∣GEANCE  of the  ALMIGHTY upon the hardened  Egyptian  Tyrant and his kingdom  of  wretched Captives in an involuntary servitude much more intolerable than any that the  Israelites  were ever guilty of exactingGREAT BRITAIN which recruits the ravages of her Cruelty Op∣pression and Injustice by an  annual  sup∣ply of more than  fifty thousand poor  See note in page  African  STRANGERS against whom  they have not the least pretence of war or quarrel  MEN AND WOMEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS    FOR BONDMEN AND FOR BONDWOMEN  to be worn out with unremitted labour like those poor injured creatures whose places they supplied  Great Britain  I say with all this accumulated load of guilt has not yet produced  four Chiefs or Noblemen  to PROTEST against this most abominable Tyranny and  to  stand in the Gap  with reverential fear of God to avert the DIVINE VEN∣GEANCE though  Religion Humanity  and even  Common Sense  ought to have prompted them to itMay we not too aptly compare the principal crimes of the  Jews  for which  they lost their liberty  to the present crying Sins of GREAT BRITAIN AND HER COLONIES  "In the midst of thee"  said a Pro∣phet from God  have they  DEALT BY OPPRESSION WITH THE STRAN∣GER  in thee have they vexed the Fatherless and the Widow  Ezek xxii And again  The People of the Land have used  OPPRESSION  and exercised  ROBBERY  and have vexed the Poor and Needy yea they have  OPPRESSED THE STRANGER WRONG∣FULLY  And I sought for  A MAN  among them that should make up the hedge and  STAND IN THE GAP  be∣fore me for the Land that I should not destroy it but I sound none  THERE∣FORE  have I poured out mine indigna∣tion upon them I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath  THEIR OWN WAY  have I  RECOMPENSED UPON THEIR HEADS  saith the Lord God  Ezek xxii And have not the Inhabitants of  Great Britain  and  her Colonies  therefore just reason to ex∣pect a  similar  VENGEANCE for  the like  OP∣PRESSIONS Do they flatter themselves that the  same God  will permit them to go  on without  recompensing  their  OWN WAY  upon their  HEADS  Slavery  for  Slavery  Or have they forgot that the God of Israel who thus reproved his pe∣culiar People for holding their  Brethren  in BONDAGE is the SAME "LORD GOD"  with whom we have to do  and that he is UNCHANGEABLE How would our Rulers and Chief Men bear a  repetition  of this unchangeable  word  in the pre∣sence of God when the Books are opened for Judgement  I sought for a Man among them that should make up the hedge and  STAND IN THE GAP  before me for the Land that I should not destroy it but I  FOUND NONE  May I not say that even  backsliding Israel  shall  rise up in Judgement with this Generation and shall condemn it  As  the backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah  Jer iii so she hath surely "justified herself more than"  BRITAIN for when the measure of her iniquity seemed to be filled by that notorious act of  Oppression  in the reign of Pekah beforementioned there were yet found in her FOUR  worthy Advocates  to  STAND IN THE GAP  before  GOD  for the Land  even four  "Chiefs"  or Nobles  "of the Children of Ephraim"  who boldly  protested  against the horrid crime of domestic  Slavery  But  Great Britain  though staggering under a much heavier load of the same kind of Guilt has not produced out of her numerous  Peerage  ONE SINGLE CHIEF to stand up  "for the Land"  and remove her burthen Mark this ye Right Reve∣rend Fathers of our Church who sit with the PRINCES  of the Realm  to con∣sult the welfare of the State Think not that I am inclined through any misguided prejudice  If I am prejudiced at all I am sure it is in favour of  Episcopacy  for I not only entertain a most  sincere personal respect and esteem for several truly worthy and learned Individuals of that order now living but I am even descended from one of the same holy function who in his correspondence with foreign Protestant churches very ably defended and promoted the  Establishment of Episcopacy  and above all I am thoroughly convinced by the Holy Scriptures that the institution of THAT ORDER in the Christian Church IS OF GOD and that the only defect in the  English Establishment  of it is the want of a FREE ELECTION  The learned Judge Blackstone in his Commentaries book I c p informs us that  ELECTION  was in  VERY EARLY TIMES  the usual mode of Elevation to the  EPISCO∣PAL CHAIR  throughout all Christendom and this  says he  was promiscuously performed by the  LAITY  as well as by the  CLERGY  "  per  CLERUM    POPULUM" for which he cites very ample authorities But afterwards a complaint of  tu∣multuous Elections  together with the supposed Royal Preroga∣tive of granting the Investiture of  Temporalities  though the  Temporalities  being originally granted to support the  Dignity  of the Office cannot reasonably be so far drawn from the first intention as to deprive the Office of that real  Dignity  which arises from a free Election served the designs of Emperors and Kings as  a pretence  to invade  the Freedom of Election  and the same  pretence  of TUMULT proved equally favourable to the op∣posite designs of Popes so that these jarring interests seemed united however in their endeavours as it were by one Spirit of  Antichrist  to deprive the Church of her  ancient Right  which  had it been maintained would probably have prevented most of the future usurpations of the  Papal Antichrist  and therefore  the Policy of the Court of Rome at the same time began by de∣grees to  EXCLUDE THE LAITY  from any share in these  ELECTIONS  says the learned Judge Blackstone  and to confine them wholly to the  CLERGY  which at length was completely effected  Blackstone c p The ori∣ginal ground for the complaint of  tumult  in these  Elections  was probably occasioned by the neglect of that unexceptionable Apostolic mode of Election described in Acts i to for when Christianity began to be corrupted by Vows of  Celibacy  and other Popish and Diabolical Doctrines the  Clergy  and  Laity  began to have opposite interests to serve which ought never to be in the Choice of their Bishop and of course the two con∣tending parties would reciprocally depend upon their own acti∣vity zeal or address for success in the  Election  so that  Tumult  the old complaint must be the necessary consequence whereas had it been an indispensible form to nominate TWO qualified persons viz either  two  by the promiscuous suffrages of both parties or  one  by each party and afterwards  in solemn prayer  to submit the final decision to the Providence of God by a Lot as in the  Apostolic Election  there could be no room for conten∣tion the undue influence and partiality of  Individuals  would be effectually checked and above all the joint prayers of  both parties  in an appeal to God's decision would certainly add  So∣lemnity  instead of  Tumult  to the  Election  if not also much ad∣ditional  Dignity to the  Elected  Dum secum habebant  APOS∣TOLI  Dominum non usi sunt  SORTE  neque post adventum Paracloti ea sunt usi  c x xvi ss  sed in uno hoc inter∣medio tempore in uno hoc negotio usi sunt  CONVENIEN∣TISSIME  Bengelii Gnomon Nov Test p This remark opens to us a very satisfactory reason why the Apostles discontinued the primitive mode of  Election  and took upon themselves the appointment of  Bishops  for while they were en∣dowed with manifest  supernatural power  in working Miracles their authority to  appoint Bishops  without the formulary precau∣tions of the first precedent could not be questioned because their appointment of Bishops was clearly the appointment of the  Holy Ghost  but when these  extraordinary  gifts ceased in the Church the primitive mode of Election became once more desirable as being best suited to the  ordinary  state of the Church in all succeeding ages This is not a singular opinion of my own the learned Bengelius p refers us not only to those who have thought as I do but also to examples of it's having been really practised in Episcopal Elections  Hodie quoque in  ELEGEND IS EPIS∣COPIS SORTI LOCUM ESSE POSSE  censet justus Jonas ad hunc locum memorabile exemplum resert Comenius in HistEcoles Slav  §  habet etiam b Riegerus Böhm Br vol  iii  p    The primitive  Election  mentioned in the Acts was the Election of a  Bishop  as well as of an  Apostle  the Office or Charge of a Bishop being apparently included in the  Apostolic  Dignity for though  Matthias  on whom the lot fell was immediately  num∣bered  among the eleven  APOSTLES  yet the vacant  Charge  to which he was elected was un questionably an  Episcopal Charge  The expression of the Holy Ghost in the Prophecy of the Psalmist Psalm cix "  let another take  HIS OFFICE" proves that the said Office was of that nature for the Hebrew word  commonly rendered  "his office"  properly signi∣fies  a  VISITATORIAL  office  which expression by the ancient Authors of the Septuagint Version as well as the  Apostle Peter  was conceived to be of the same general import as an Office of SUPERINTENDENCY and therefore they all called it  an Epis∣copate  literally  let another take his Episcopate  or  "Bishoprick"  Matthias therefore and the other Apostles were properly  or  Bishops  and the Right of Nomination to the vacant Charge was not then confined to the Apostles alone as Dr Hammond without au∣thority of Scripture has asserted but an appeal was made to the sense of the whole Congregation the  or Crowd of Persons then present by the Apostle Peter and  they  accord∣ingly  appointed two  and afterwards joining in so∣lemn prayer submitted the decision or final  Election  by lot to the Providence of God  "Thou Lord"  said they    which knowest the hearts of all men shew of these  TWO  the  ONE  whom thou hast chosen      The person on whom the lot fell might from the T  be truly denominated CLERICUS as he was thereby authorized to take upon himself  the  LOT  of service  TON KAHPON  The very learned and judicious Erasmus was of the same opinion respecting the ap∣pointment  of  two  persons by the  Congregation  or    Haec oratio  says he speaking of Peter's Address to the People "  quum placuisset  MULTITUDINI  statuerunt  DUOS"  c  And a little afterwards he gives the following commendation of that primitive example  Tametsi  SORTES  periculosae non sunt quae utricunque faverint probum idoneum designant Nec torum negotium creditum est  SORTIBUS SUFFRAGIIS  sunt electi  DUO  probatissimi Inter hos ambiguitatem Electionis finiit  SORS  quae nec ipsa temeritatem habere potuit cujus eventum moderatur precatio  SORS  igitur haec quae nihil aliudsuit quàm  DECLA∣RATIO DIVINAE VOLUNTATIS  designavit  MATTHIAM  quanquam  JOSEPH  praeter cognominis  viz Justus  com∣mendationem etiam  JESU  propinquitate commendebatur Et tamen huic praelatus est Matthias quo nos doceremur  IN DELI∣GENDIS EPIS COPIS  quibus credenda sit Evangelicae Doctrinae dispensatio adeo nihil esse tribuendum humanis affectibus  c  to the Office For as it may clearly be  proved that the  Churches of Britain and Ireland  have a just and ancient  Right  to  elect  their own Bishops and did actually exercise that right for many ages till the antichristian Usurpations of  Monks  and  Popes  over the  secular or parochial Clergy occasioned the interfer∣ence of Kings so it may as clearly be demonstrated that the present mode of  Election  by Writ of  Congé D' Eslire  sent to the several Cathedral Chapters toge∣ther  with a Letter Missive containing the name of the person which they shall Elect and Chase  agreeable to the Act of Hen VIII cli xx sec is a total perversion of that just and ancient  Right  In a little Tract by  John Barnes  an English Benedictine intituled  Sententia de Ecclesiae Britannicae Privilegiis  which was printed together with some little Tracts of Archbishop Usher in we find still a more ample testimony of the  ancient Right  of chusing  Bishops    Cùm  ANTIQUI MORES  Ecclesiae suae  speaking of the ancient BRITISH SCOTCH and IRISH  postularènt ut  OMMIA  inter se  SYNODICE  agerent tum pro  EPISCOPORUM ORDINATIONIBUS  tum pro aliis negotiis Ecclesiasticis  Verba corum ex  BEDA  lib  ii  Ec∣eles Hist sunt  QUOD NON POSSUNT ABSQUE SUORUM CON∣SENSU  ET LICENTIA PRISCIS ABDICARE MORIBUS" P And after citing an example from  Bede  concerning  the Election of a Bishop  viz Aidan by a Scotch Synod at the request of the Saxon King  Oswald  to instruct and preside over the Ministry of the newly converted Saxon or English Church see p and he further remarks  Et ex  HUNGTINGDONIENSI  says he  lib  iii  Hist  BED  lib  ii  constat  ET SCOTOS ET BRITANNOS OMNIA SUA COMMUNI CON∣SENSU EGISSE  It appears also that the  Saxon  or  English  Church though much less ancient than the  British Irish  and  Scotch  Churches did yet enjoy the same inestimable privilege of  electing Bishops  The Monk  Matthew Paris  has transmitted to us a memorable example of this in his Account of the Election A D of the celebrated  Ulstan  to be Bishop of Worcester  Processu au∣temtemporis  ULSTANUS ELECTO  ad Archiepiscopatum Ebora∣censem  ALDREDO  unanimi consensu tam  CLERI  quam  TO∣TIUS PLEBIS  Rege insuper ut quem vellent sibi eligerent prae∣sulem animarum Pastorem annuente  IN EPISCOPUM  ejus∣dem loci  ELIGITUR  P And even in later times when  the Romish Corruptions  had so far prevailed as to exclude the LAITY from Elections yet the Clergy still enjoyed  the free right of electing their Prelates whether Abbots or Bishops  for the learned Judge Blackstone informs us that  this right  was granted in a charter  to all the Monasteries and Cathedrals in the Kingdom  by King John see vol i p and also that  this grant was expressly recognized and confirmed in King John's  MAGNA CARTA  and was again established by  STATUTE  Edward  III  St  §  Ibid  This Statute first gave  parliamentary authority  indeed to the King's  Congé D' Eslire  though it was in use long before and acknowledges the King's Right of  Assent  or Approbation  "after the Election"  yet it contains nothing which can remove the prudent and reasonable limitation to which that  Assent  or  Approbation  was formerly sub∣ject  viz  that it  WAS NOT TO BE DENIED WITHOUT A REASONABLE AND LAWFUL CAUSE  Judge Blackstone b i c p And this very Act which was manifestly ordained to restrain the simoniacal practices and shameful usurpa∣tions of the Bishops of Rome expressly acknowledges the Right of FREE ELECTIONS in the Church  viz  that the FREE ELECTIONS of the Archbishops Bishops and all other Dignities and Benefices ELECTIVE  in England  shall hold  c  The  Right  was also fully established by preceding Statutes still  in force  though unhappily for this Kingdom not  in use  as "  There shall be  FREE ELECTION  of Dignities of the Church  " Edward II c Title And again  ELECTIONS OUGHT TO BE FREE  Edward I c Mr Ruffhead in his useful Index to the Statutes very properly refers us under the head of "ELECTION of BISHOPS" to this lastmentioned  Statute for  Episcopal Elections  ought certainly to be included in the meaning of the said Statute as well as  all other Elections  for an ELECTION without a CHOICE is a manifest contradiction in term  and NO ELECTION  abovemen∣tioned and is entirely destructive of all the desirable purposes of a free  Election  This practice however cannot be censured in stronger terms than those in  which it is expressly condemned by a  subsequent Act of Parliament  Edw VI chap ii though the former Act is supposed to be still in force viz  The said  ELECTIONS  be in very deed  NO ELECTIONS  but only  by a Writ of  CONGE D'ESLIRE  have colours sha∣dows and pretences of Elections serving nevertheless to no purpose  c  If it had not been for this notorious defect in point of  Election  and the general idea of its  consequences  I  am persuaded that the late worthy Primate of Eng∣land would not have found such opposition in hi  endeavours some few years ago to promote  the esta∣blishment of  EPISCOPACY  in America  to charge  your Order  in particular with the omission The  crying Sin  has hitherto  been far distant from your  sight  and perhaps was never fully represented to  you or like  faithful Watchmen of Israel  you would long ago have warned our  Nation of the
