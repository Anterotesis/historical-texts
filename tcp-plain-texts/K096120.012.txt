SOHO and sold by all Booksellers  M DCC XCII  Among others I saw adds this author a counterfeit lieutenant of the police who was suffered to exercise a pretty severe distibutive justice Another company who personated the aga or general of the Janissaries took possession of his house whilst he went his rounds and his servants treated the mask with as much respect as if it had been their master  Many persons in office have comedies acted before their houses the whole time the subjects of these are various but always very indecent and the more they are so the greater satisfaction they seem to give It is impossible to see without astonishment the hall of the divan that terrible and dreadful tribunal decked out for some days in the most ridiculous manner  Turning lanterns on which are painted extravagant and often obscene figures mixed with transparent writings consisting of the name of God his attributes the cypher of the Grand Signor or some play on words and pieces of lookingglass intended to increase the splendour of these illuminations amuse the multi∣tude at a small expence Persons whom we might expect to be the most grave from their age and the importance of their employments are not the least pleased with these trivial and puerile imitations A little palace made by a European with bits of glass and glue the vizir had given a thousand crowns for to make a figure on a similar occasion  The pleasure of knocking down Christians is so great a treat to the Turks that the favourites of Sultan  Mahomet  could imagine nothing better to amuse their master in an entertainment which they gave on this occasion within the seraglio And they thought so little of it as to request the foreign ambassadors to lend them their European dresses in order to put them on the Jews to make them resemble Christians The Jews ever destined to be beaten and ever ready to suffer if it could be made worth their while submitted to all they pleased to inflict Once the court of the seraglio agreed that the Jews never earned their money better than on that day The ambassadors were the greater fools of the two in suffering themselves to be thus ridiculed  It is at these times says  Habesci  that the Turkish ladies endeavour to accomplish their amorous designs being permitted to go abroad veiled during the festival of the Bayram and on all public rejoicings When these opportunities occur they take with them a small bundle carefully concealed containing a change of dress Their own is always of gay colours with yel∣low drawers and a kind of halfboots of the same colour fitted close to the legs The robes of the Christian women are of dismal dark colours and not made so loose and flowing as the Turkish in short the difference is as great as can well be imagined Having disguised themselves in this dress they cross the water  to Pera and if they have any appointment which is generally the case and made by the intermission of some Jew at whose house they have changed their dress they go directly to the tavern where their lover is to meet them If not they walk up and down the beautiful esplanade of Pera which is generally crouded with the most brilliant company of Constantinople When they see any young Christian who attracts their attention they let him know it by some significant glances and if these are not sufficient to allure him beckon him aside and make him an offer of their person accompanied by some valuable present which gives him to understand they are women of rank perhaps of the highest A brilliant or an emerald of five hundred pounds value is a trifle at such a time  A Turkish lady of quality walking one day in the manner we have described took a fancy to a French youth of about sixteen Being in a Greek dress she made no scruple of accosting him presenting a diamond to him and requesting to speak with him alone The Frenchman was at no loss to conceive her meaning and being no stranger to the houses of pleasure at Pera retired with her to one of the best The first meeting gave so much satisfaction that a second was agreed on The day appointed they were both punctual and after repeated proofs of their reciprocal affection the lady proposed a scheme for taking her gallant home She was the wife of a very rich and noble Turk who  had no other and only kept four female slaves in his haram he was very old but doated on his faithful wife The youth having accepted her offer prepared himself for the adventure She then sent for a Jew a dealer in slaves to whom she offered a present of a ducats if he would render her a very particular service which required fidelity and secrecy The Jew who would have sold  Moses  and  Aaron  for such a sum readily consented "Go then says she to a certain tavern at Pera where you will find a handsome French lad he will expect you and dress him in the habit of a female slave this done bring him here and offer to sell him to my husband but do not ask more than piastres leaving your future recom∣pence to me" The Jew highly pleased with his good fortune purchased the necessary cloaths and went immediately to Pera where the youth impatiently ex∣pected him The disguise being completed he was conducted to the Turk's house and presented to him as a slave to be sold The husband thought the pre∣tended slave very pretty but would not purchase her lest it should make his wife jealous By accident the lady made her appearance and enquiring what the girl was brought for insisted he should as a proof of his affection in being able to see so pretty a girl every day without any improper thoughts "Buy her said she and give her to me I will keep her constantly about my person and take care she does not rob me of your heart" The Turk who never denied his dear wife  any favour he could grant her paid the price agreed on and this slave to love was then placed in the para∣dise of  Mahomet  The Turk grew delighted with the beauty and address of his late purchase and imputed his wife's increased fondness for him to the assiduities of the slave who always kept her lively and in good humour In fine the simple Turk grew more ena∣moured with his wife than ordinary became as he thought a father and finding his wife grow big at the end of eight months made a public declaration of it to the surprize of every one  The sole interruption to the happiness of the slave and her mistress arose from the importunities and me∣naces of the Jew He paid his visits regularly once a week in order to extort money from the lady through a fear of detection His enquiries as to the health of the family were generally accompanied with some disastrous tale of his losses in trade in short he made about piastres by this intrigue At length another circumstance threatened a discovery and obliged a final separation This was that our slave began to discover a beard which could not be kept under shaving only increasing its growth And after a thousand protestations of love and gratitude he was permitted to make his escape in the night loaded with jewels and money  It is not a little singular that the most infamous of all the houses of gallantry at Pera is near the hotel of our ambassador And nothing is more common than for Turkish ladies of rank to disguise themselves and hire a room in this house so situated as to see every person who enters it and when they have pitched upon a man they like according to a private agreement with the master he is shewn up to the dis∣guised lady as to one of his public girls If he is a man of gallantry he finds himself most agreeably sur∣prized for instead of being in the arms perhaps of a diseased prostitute he finds himself in the possession of a lovely wholesome wanton and instead of being called upon for money he is in fact amply rewarded  In the city suburbs and along the banks of the canal of the Black sea there are no less than of these houses their number is easily ascertained the masters of each paying a gold ducat per day for a licence to keep them open this is a settled tax which never varies It is well known they are kept by Greeks but they are chiefly frequented and sup∣ported by Turks of every rank and description The most esteemed taverns are those of Galata and Pera which are filled with the better sort of Turks every Friday There being no divans held on that day for the decision of causes doctors of the law moulahs and emirs with their green turbans resort to them and pass the whole day in eating drinking and other  amusements not to be mentioned In most of them there are little companies of five or six singing and dancing boys two of them play on some instrument the others dance and sing they are dressed like girls and accompany words adapted to the purpose with wanton looks and gestures which will often so please their employers that they will almost cover the boys faces with ducats sticking them on with their spittle and the boys in their turn have the dexterity in the course of the dance to slide them almost impercep∣tibly into their pockets One would imagine this amusement and the intoxication of liquor would pro∣duce the most unnatural effects not at all A Turk in liquor is quite different from a Greek The latter in his cups is lively enterprizing and desperate he is noisy and quarrelsome wants to fight to kill and dethrone the Ottoman monarch that he may restore the empire to the Christians The Turk on the con∣trary is lifeless peaceable timid and afraid to utter a single word it is then and then only that a Christian may insult and use him ill with impunity  This violation of the law of  Mahomet  prohibiting the use of wine is now become so notorious that the Turkish government does not attempt to apply any remedy to so general a corruption And indeed with what face could they pretend to reform this evil when all orders of the state are more or less infected by it from the Grand Signor down to the simple Janissary  not excepting even the mufti the imans the moulahs and the emirs of the sacred lineage of  Mahomet  The women and eunuchs in the seraglio are more addicted to spirituous liquors than wine of this some judgment may be formed by a debt left unpaid at the death of Sultan  Mustapha  for cases of French  liqueurs  this degeneracy however has been the chief cause of the decline of the empire and will no doubt hasten its fall  Except in their public festivals when licentiousness is always extreme and always allowed the actors of comedies in Turkey who are Jews never exhibit their talents but within the walls of houses where marriages are celebrated or some particular entertain∣ments given These companies of wretched buffoons are either all men or all women  To give some idea of their wretched theatrical per∣formances Baron  Tott  relates the particulars of a public entertainment given on the birth of a princess by one of the great officers of state in the meadows near Constantinople  Two great posts forty feet distant from each other supported a cord fastened to their upper ends Round this cord other cords were tied to which glass lamps were fixed at convenient distances from the objects they were intended to illuminate The cypher of the Grand Signor the representation of his barge and  words taken from the Alcoran decorated the edifice during the three days this entertainment lasted while ropedancers a company of Jewish comedians and female figuredancers amused the spectators till the night was far advanced This spectacle became still more worthy curiosity by the light of a score of chafing dishes of iron raised upon stakes in which a red flame was maintained by burning rays dipped in tar and pinesplinters  These dismal chandeliers were placed in a circle to give light to the dancers in the center while tents prepared for the grand vizir and his company formed together with the multitudes who were present a grand line of circumvallation of which the women of the populace occupied a part The illumination without this circle was only to give notice of the entertain∣ment of which the comedy was the most valuable article  A kind of cage three feet square and six feet high hung round with a curtain represents a house and contains one of the Jewish actors dressed like a woman Another Jew in the habit of a young Turk and sup∣posed to be enamoured with the lady of the house a valet pleasantly absurd a fourth Jew dressed like a woman and acting the part of gallant a husband who is imposed upon and in short the characters which are seen every where stand without and compose the  piece But that which is to be met with no where else is the  denouement  every thing is acted and nothing left to the imagination of the spectators and if the summons of the Muczzin is heard during these interludes the mussulmen turn their faces towards Mecca whilst the actors continue to play each their part I shall have said enough of this strange mixture of momentary devotion and continued indecency adds the baron to those who perceive that this pic∣ture difficult to describe ought still less to be de∣scribed  Some clumsy ropedancers awkward wrestlers stupid buffoons and female figuredancers fill up the intervals between one comedy and another Among these last whose merit certainly neither lies in the elegance of their step nor propriety of their action but who give infinite pleasure to the Turks by that talent which is their characteristic a young girl be∣tween ten and twelve years old distinguished herself greatly and when at the end of every dance she according to custom went round with the plate to receive in money the value of those agreeable ideas which she had raised in the company the Turkish lords put her as it were up to auction sticking sequins on her forehead to prove their good wishes A sequin is a piece of gold so light that putting it on the forehead it will stick there for some time and it is customary with the Turks to recompense in this  manner the agility of their dancers The price of this slave whose figure was not extraordinary amounted to twelve purses or seven hundred and fifty pounds which were given for her to the merchant by an old molloch or lawyer  At the feast of Tchiragan or Tulips so called says Baron  Tott  because it consists in illuminating a gar∣den and this flower being that which the Turks most admire the gardens of the haram are laid out in a most superb taste Vases of every kind filled with natural and artificial flowers are brought for the occasion and add to the splendour of an illumination caused by an infinite number of lanterns coloured lamps and wax candles in glass tubes reflected on every side by mirrors disposed for that purpose Shops erected for the rejoicing and furnished with different kinds of wares are occupied by the women of the haram who represent in proper dresses dealers and offer the goods they contain for sale The sultanas whether sisters nieces or cousins of the emperor are invited by him to partake of this amusement and they as well as his highness purchase in these shops trinkets and toys of which they make each other presents ex∣tending likewise their generosity to the women of the Grand Signor who are admitted to this diversion or who occupy the shops and the dances music and other recreations prolong the entertainment till the night is far advanced which spreads a kind of mo∣mentary  gaiety over a place seemingly in every other respect devoted to sadness and discontent  Besides the amusements of the seraglio the Grand Signor frequently diverts himself in hawking or hunting Once every year there is a grand hunting party ap∣pointed A large track of country is then inclosed to such an extent says  Le Brun  as would take up several days to ride over The inhabitants of all the towns and villages where it lies are also required to give their aid and assistance By this means the game is surrounded and brought into a very confined circle The Grand Signor then ascends some eminence and has the pleasure of seeing it knocked down with bludgeons which is sometimes not very easy especially if there are plenty of wild boars among the game  The ordinary hunt is held every week during the winter particularly and lasts from morning to night The prince attended with a large retinue of fifty or sixty of his houshold besides his huntsmen hunts generally as we do hares and foxes but sometimes wolves and at others unhoods his falcons in quest of pheasants and partridges  When the Grand Signor goes to any of his country seats he generally travels in a kind of coach so con∣trived that those ladies he takes with him can have  the pleasure of viewing all external objects without being seen themselves  Their coaches are not at all like ours but much more convenient for the country the heat being so great that glasses would be very troublesome They are made a good deal in the manner of Dutch stagecoaches having wooden lattices painted and gilded the inside being also painted with baskets and nose∣gays of flowers intermixed commonly with little poetical mottos They are covered all over with scarlet cloth lined with silk and very often richly embroidered and fringed This covering entirely hides the persons in them but may be thrown back at pleasure and thus permits the ladies to peep through the lattices They hold four people very conveni∣ently seated on cushions but not raised  The sultan when he wants to make the common people believe he has no fears goes out incognito in a hired boat with only two or three attendants I have seen him come out in this manner from a back door of his garden says Lady  C  just after his fleet had sailed a fire the night before was calculated to renew his fears if he had lost them But here it is known when he sallies forth without guards or ceremony It is like children who sing in the dark to make their nurses believe that they are not afraid  Travelling is cheaper in Turkey than in any other part of the world on account of the small expence of horsehire and the cheapness of provisions and particularly to Christians who have only to apply through the medium of their ambassador to the of∣ficers of the Porte who will grant them a  Firman  from the Grand Signor by which nearly all their travelling charges are borne at his expence There are no stated posts in Turkey but at the distance of three or four leagues there are houses of enter∣tainment and horses stationed for the Grand Signor's couriers and those persons to whom he gives these  Firmans  or orders  When a nobleman or gentleman having a  Fir∣man  arrives at one of these stages there are persons ready to take charge of his baggage and horses while he refreshes himself and provide him with fresh ones There is always some refreshment to be had at these places so that let a traveller arrive at what∣ever hour of the day or night he pleases he is certain of being well entertained  As for the caravanseras or inns where those travellers stop who have no Firman they are to be met with at proper distances in almost every town or village Those in the towns as we have remarked are magnificently built of stone and covered with  lead they are in the form of a square with a quadrangle within and a little piazza or cloyster in one of the sides with cells to lodge in like those in the monasteries They are usually furnished with matts or straw but no beds to lie on and the tra∣veller is not only provided with his lodging  gratis  but in many of them with his diet and such is the hospitality of the Turks that if a poor tra∣veller has no provision of his own he may with∣out ceremony sit down and eat with any of his countrymen  Lord  Baltimore  gives us the following description of a caravansera in RomaniaIn our journey says he we lodged in a large and commodious Khan capable of accommodating three or four hundred persons the entrance was through a grand stone portal into a quadrangle bigger than the Royal Exchange with a large fountain in the middle On each side were apartments without furniture one side for the women and the other for the men From this quadrangle issued stables capable of holding horses It is entirely built of freestone with regular masonry and the whole covered with sheet lead It must have cost an im∣mense sum and was built through the vanity and devotion of a Grand Vizier the Turks as we have  already observed esteeming it an act of piety to build such inns for the free reception of travellers  The Turks are accustomed to chew opium as our seamen chew tobacco and I apprehend upon the same principle Sailors say it keeps them warm and it is well known that persons accustomed to opium feel a chilliness upon leaving it off Being by their religion forbidden the use of wine and requiring something occasionally to raise their spirits was the origin of this custom and the pleasing in∣toxication or insensibility it brings on with the uncommon flow of spirits it afterwards occasions has led them to a continuance of this destructive habit A Turk will chew as much opium in a day as would destroy halfadozen men unaccustomed to it a convincing proof that habit is second nature and that what is one man's food is another man's poison  Those who have given themselves up to the im∣moderate use of this drug are easily known by the kind of rickets which in the end it never fails to produce There are shops in a particular part of the city on purpose for the sale of it the lovers of opium go into them and call for a dish of coffee after which they smoke two or three pipes and then swallow the pernicious drug in pills drinking with them a cup of cold water after this they take ano∣ther  dish of coffee and a fresh pipe and while this last pipe is in their mouth they begin to feel a vo∣luptuous sensation which thrills through all their veins and lulls their senses in such a manner that they remain in a state of inaction with their eyes half open as if they were between sleeping and waking They continue in this sensation two or three hours according to the quantity they have taken during which time they pretend they have tasted the most sensual delights it is possible for the human body to enjoy and that it is in this state of intoxication their Prophet  Mahomet  inspires them with good ideas and communicates to them his own and the Divine will The pale and melancholy figures which these miserable slaves to their intemperate vo∣luptuousness exhibit would be sufficient to raise our pity says Baron  Tott  did not their lengthened necks their heads turned on one side their backbone distorted their shoulders raised up to their ears and a number of other extragavant attitudes which result from this disease present a most ridiculous and melancholy picture Those most used to this pernicious custom he adds will swallow four pills at once each larger than an olive An agreeable re∣verie at the end of three quarters of an hour or an hour at most never fails to animate these auto∣matons they throw themselves into a thousand dif∣ferent postures but always extragavant and merry  This is the moment when the scene becomes most interesting all the actors are happy and each re∣turns home in a state of total irrationality but in en∣tire and full enjoyment of a happiness they say not to be procured without it Disregarding the ridicule of those they meet who take delight in making them talk absurdly they fancy themselves possessed of whatever they wish for  There is one custom says Lady  M  peculiar to this countryAdoptionvery common among the Turks and yet more so among the Greeks and Ar∣menians Not having it in their power to give their estates to a friend or distant relation to avoid their falling into the Grand Signor's treasury when they are not likely to have any children of their own they will choose some pretty child of either sex amongst the meanest people carry the child and its parents before the Cadi and then declare they receive it for their heir The parents at the same time renounce all future claim to it a writing is drawn and witnes∣sed and a child thus adopted cannot be disinherited Notwithstanding this noble provision many common beggars have been seen that have refused to part with their children in this manner to some of the richest among the Greeks so powerful is the instinc∣tive affection natural to parents though the adopting father is generally very tender as they call it to  the child of his soul I own says Lady  M  this custom pleases me much better than our absurd one of leaving legacies and estates to persons of our own name it is much more reasonable to make an infant happy and rich whom I educate after my own man∣ner brought up in the Turkish phrase upon my knees and who has learned to look upon me with a filial aspect than to give an estate to one without merit or relation to memerely because he bears the same name  The principal recreations of the Turks are smoak∣ing and playing at chess but they never play for mo∣ney that being contrary to the precepts of the alcoran They will likewise listen patiently for hours together to the stories and buffooneries of their merryan∣drews and juglers They never by way of exercise walk backwards and forwards in a chamber or in any public walk as is the custom among us but look upon it as ridiculous and laugh at the Christians for so doing Seeing an Englishman walking up and down a room one asked a friend of his if he was not disturbed in mind  The diversions of those bred up to a military life are very different These consist in shooting at a mark with bows and arrows at which exercise they are very expert they are likewise very adroit in  the use of firearms and there are some who will hit a mark with a gun at full speed on horseback  Another diversion is fishing and the manner in which they fish has something extraordinary in it they take this diversion in the night time and make use of fire for this purpose fastening an iron grate at the end of a stick and burning straw on it or small wood which makes a great blaze the fish are attracted by the light gather round it in shoals and are caught in a net laid to ensnare them  Music also is a customary and most familiar amuse∣ment with them Their martial music is of the most barbarous kind enormous hollow trunks beaten by mallets unite heavy noise to the lively and clear notes of little timbrels which they accompany with clarinets and shrill trumpets the tones of which are forced to compleat the most discordant confusion of sounds that can be imagined  Their chamber music is on the contrary very soft and if its monotony of semitones which is at first offensive should be condemned it must be allowed to possess a kind of melancholy expression with which the Turks are extremely affected A violin with three strings raised to the pitch of the  guim∣bard  or  viol d'amour  which they have adopted  the Dervise flute sweeter than our German flute a sort of drum a kind of mandoline with a long handle and strung with wire the pipe or flute of  Pan  and the tabor intended to render the time more exact compose their orchestra placed at the end of an apartment where the musicians crouching down upon their hams play melodious and lively airs without written music but always in unison whilst the company in profound silence become in∣toxicated with languishing enthusiasm the smoke of their pipes and pills of opium  Turkish music adds Lord  Baltimore  though very different from ours is by no means disagreeable it consists mostly in unisons There is a temple in Pera in which is performed twice a week the dance of the Dervises one of the most extraordinary ceremonies to be seen any where Christians are admitted to a sight of it the Turks esteeming it so delightful a performance as to induce every one who sees it to turn Mahometan Seven or eight Dervises with high conical caps and a kind of long petticoats nar∣row at top and broad at the bottom enter a large circle and after having bowed to their president be∣gin to turn round in a certain measure to music that at first plays very slowly but increases by degrees to the utmost rapidity whilst the Dervises accelerate  their motions in like manner and continue it for about twenty minutes without being the least giddy  We shall conclude our account of the character customs and manners of this famed people of the East from Lord  B  Those who delight in fine paintings carving fine furniture Grecian architec∣ture the Roman classics in the various labyrinths of medicine in respect shewn to them in politeness gallantry gazettes operas plays concerts and as∣semblies or those who would learn a regular exercise from the Prussian infantry the admirable construction of French fortifications the great science of naviga∣tion from an English navy or profound knowledge in almost any thing whatever will not find their ac∣count in Constantinople or any place near it  CHAP X  Births Marriages and Funerals  THE Turks have a notion that when a woman leaves off bringing forth children it is because she is too old let her face say what it will to the con∣trary This opinion makes the ladies so ready to give proofs of their youth which is as necessary here in order to be a received beauty as it is to produce proofs of nobility to be admitted a knight of Malta They do not content themselves with using the natural means but fly to all sorts of quack∣eries to avoid the scandal of being past childbearing and often destroy themselves in so doing Without any exaggeration says Lady  M  all the women of my acquaintance have twelve or thirteen children and the old ones boast of having had five and twenty or thirty and are respected according to the number they have producedWhen they are with child it is their common expression to say they hope God will be so merciful as to send them two this time and  when they have been asked how they expected to provide for such a flock as they desire they answer the plague will certainly kill half of them which indeed generally happens without much concern to the parents who are satisfied with the vanity of having brought forth so plentifully What is most wonderful is the exemption they seem to enjoy from the curse entailed on the sex that of bring∣ing forth children with labour and pain they see company on the day of their delivery and at the fortnight's end return visits and dress themselves out in all their jewels and new cloaths There are no professed midwives neighbours assisting each other in these kind offices  At the first symptoms of an approaching labour in the Seraglio the Vizier the Mufti and the grand officers civil and miltary are sent for to wait the moment of delivery in the hall of the Sopha which is the intermediate apartment that separates the Ha∣rem from the rest of the buildings occupied by the Grand Signior and his houshold Immediately after the delivery the Kislar Aga comes out of the Harem with the infant to present it to the great officers of state who draw up a certificate of its birth and sex after which the guns of the Sopha are fired and these are repeated by those on the cape of the Seraglio and at Tophana To these different salutes succeed  those of the Customhouse the Fleet and the Tower of Leander  Marriage among the Mahometans is only a civil act or contract entered into in the presence of the Cadi or judge who in this case officiates only as a common notary There is no religious ceremony performed on this occasion nor is the bride even re∣quired to be present The father or some of her re∣lations appear in her behalf and this ceremony through custom has the force of law The portion as well as the paraphernalia which are objects of the most importance are registered in this instrument which secures the return of them to be made in case of divorce After the contract is signed the relations of the bride bring her with great ceremony to her husband's house who undresses and puts her to bed  A very remarkable circumstance in the Turkish marriages is that the wife never brings a portion to the husband but the husband on the contrary assigns one to his wife This marriage portion cannot be registered in the marriage contract because it is only stipulated and not payable except in case of the death of the husband or of a divorce In this it differs from the Kapin which becomes due at the expiration of the term prescribed by the contract This is so true that when a woman demands separation from her  husband on account of illtreatment or for want of a proper maintenance she must give up her portion in presence of the judge and pronounce the following form of words usual when such a divorce is ob∣tained  Nikiahum khalal bachum agad  i e "My portion resigned my person free" If the husband solicits the divorce he is obliged to allow his wife her portion her cloaths and her jewels and she then restores him the contract in presence of the judge  They have likewise an inferior kind of marriage which they call  Kapin  This contract is likewise made before the Cadi but it is only for a limited time and a sum of money is stipulated to be paid by the husband to the woman if he puts her away at the expiration of the time This species of marriage was instituted for the convenience and pleasure of strangers and travellers The Turks are allowed seven of these wives but few of them will have more than one or two on account of the heavy expences attending them Their other wives are their womenslaves and of these every man may have as many as he pleases and the children he has by them are consi∣dered as legitimate and have as much right to their father's inheritance as any of the rest if he en∣franchises them by his will otherwise they remain slaves to the eldest by the lawful wife but if a Turk takes a slave to his bed and she has children by him  he is not allowed to dispose of her again but she be∣comes one of his family A Mahometan may marry women of any religion under the sun provided there are books written or printed in its favour even the eunuchs are allowed to marry and several of them have many wives Mahomet himself having set the example A Turk is allowed four legitimate wives and he is limited to this number rather from economy than the rigour of the law for as he is obliged to make a settlement upon each at his marriage the ex∣pence would be insupportable  The Turkish laws forbid maids and married women to unveil to any man but the husband or relations within a certain degree A Turk therefore marries the daughter of his neighbour or his widow without knowing her He can only determine by the report of his own women or some person by whom she has been seen  They relate a pleasant story of a man who as is usually the case not having seen his wife till after his marriage and finding her far from handsome two or three days after their nuptials when she desired him to name the persons who were to have the privilege of  Namaharem  that is of entering her Harem this is generally restricted to the father uncle and brothers of the married lady that she might not endeavour to  conceal herself from them returned for answer "I give you my free permission my dear to shew your∣self to all the men in the world except to myself"  On a moment's reflection we shall perceive that this law of  Namaharem  cannot be so scrupulously ob∣served among the common people as by those whose situation places them more at their ease The artist may call in the assistance of his eyes to direct his choice when the want of fortune renders his right to a plurality useless Misfortune almost always meets with something by which it is consoled It is only the abuse of happiness that is destitute of every alle∣viation  Plurality of wives is of this latter kind it leads to extravagant expences By whom can they be sup∣ported except by those who having been engaged in commerce are become rich by their economy or by such as have arrived at opulence by their employ∣ments The fortune of these persons is merely personal which avidity accumulates and terror conceals which luxury dissipates and opportunity renews The un∣certainty of their situation increases their haste to ac∣quire and to squander  The Turks rarely leave large fortunes to their chil∣dren Sums sufficiently considerable to serve for  portions would be capable of exciting the avidity of the Sultan and he would easily find pretences to sieze them by searching into the means by which they were acquired  A Turk therefore is seldom rich enough to main∣tain any considerable Harem till by the favour of his patron he has arrived at employments of great authority and where this authority becomes lucrative in proportion as it is abused  But mixed with other young persons whom the same ambitious expectations have attached to the same master reduced to live among men only car∣ried away by the violence of his passions separated from the women though excited by knowing they are near if such a Turk is obliged to cede to nature he cannot but wander from her laws  We have already seen that the Turkish women who cannot be procured but by marriage nor known till that has taken place are equally reduced to live entirely among themselves What therefore must be their education Born in opulence they are ei∣ther the daughters of a legal wife or of a slave the favourite of the moment Their brothers and sisters have had different mothers who were no other than slaves in the same house Without any employment  but that furnished by jealousy scarcely able to read or write or if they read reading nothing but the alcoran exposed in their hot baths to all the incon∣veniences of a forced perspiration so frequently re∣peated as to destroy the freshness of their complexion and the grace of their features even before they are marriagable indolent through pride and frequently mortified by the efficacy of the means employed be∣fore their eyes to please their proprietors what gra∣tification can such women says Baron  Tott  be sup∣posed to give their husbands  It is very remarkable that the concubinage of the husband does not make the wife jealous as in Chris∣tian countries however the husbands are obliged to caress their wives once a week at least if not they may lodge a complaint with the Cadi and demand a divorce if they think proper complaints of this kind are very frequent among the lower class of people as to the better sort they know how to indemnify themselves by more agreeable and more secret means The dishonour attending the infidelity wan∣tonness and lubricity of Turkish wives does not fall upon the husband but upon the relations of the wo∣man who made the contract for her before the Cadi The Grand Signor is not obliged to marry but the first four women who have children by him are called the Sultanas his wives  Lady  M  mentions two other particulars respecting their marriages worthy of being remarked when a man has divorced his wife in the most solemn manner he can take her again upon no other terms than per∣mitting another man to pass a night with her and there are some examples of those who have submitted to this law rather than not have back their beloved The other point of doctrine is very extraordinary Any woman that dies unmarried is looked upon to die in a state of reprobation To confirm this be∣lief they reason that the end of the creation of wo∣man is to increase and multiply and that she is only properly employed in the work of her calling when she is bringing forth children or taking care of them which are all the virtues that God expects from her Our vulgar notion that they admit not wo∣men to have souls is a mistake It is true they say women are not of so elevated a nature and there∣fore must not hope for admission into the paradise appointed for the men who are to be entertained by celestial beauties But there is a place of hap∣piness destined for souls of the inferior order where all good women are to be in eternal bliss Many of them are very superstitious and will not remain widows ten days for fear of dying in the reprobate state of a useless creature But those that like their liberty and are not slaves to their religion content themselves with marrying when they are afraid of  dying This is a piece of theology very different from that which teaches that nothing is more accept∣able to God than a vow of perpetual virginity  It is very pleasant says Lady  M  to observe how tenderly the admirable Mr  Hill  who so gravely asserts he saw in Sancta Sophia a sweating pillar very balsamic for disordered heads as well as all his brethren voyagewriters lament the miserable confinement of the Turkish ladies who are perhaps more free than any ladies in the universe and are the only women in the world that lead a life of un∣interrupted pleasure exempt from cares their whole time being spent in visiting bathing or the agreeable amusement of spending money and inventing new fashions A husband would be thought mad that exacted any degree of economy from his wife whose expences are no way limited but by her fancy It is  his  business to get money and  hers  to spend it and this noble prerogative extends itself to the very meanest of the sex Here is a fellow who carries embroidered handkerchiefs on his back to sell and as miserable a figure as such a mean dealer may be supposed his wife will scorn to wear any thing less than her cloth of gold her ermine furs and a very handsome set of jewels on her head It is true they have no places of amusement but the bagnios and  there can only be seen by their own sex however it is a diversion they take delight in  At one of these adds Lady  M  I had an oppor∣tunity of seeing a Turkish bride received and all the ceremony used on that occasion which made me recollect the epithlamium of  Helen  by  Theocritus  and it seems to me that the same customs have con∣tinued ever since All the female friends relations and acquaintances of the two families newly allied meet at the bagnio and several others go out of curio∣sity to the number of two hundred women Those that were or had been married placed themselves round the rooms on the marble sosas but the virgins very hastily threw off their cloaths and appeared with∣out any ornament or covering than their own long hair braided with pearl or ribbon Two of them met the bride at the door conducted by her mother and another grave relation She was a beautiful maid of about seventeen very richly dressed and shining with jewels but was presently reduced to a state of nature Two others filled silver gilt pots with per∣fume and began the procession the rest following in procession to the number of thirty The leaders sung an epithalamium answered by the others in chorus and the last two led the fair bride her eyes fixed on the ground with a charming affectation of modesty In this order they marched round the three large rooms  of the bagnio It is not easy to represent the beauty of this sight most of them being well proportioned and white skinned all of them perfectly smooth and polished by the frequent use of bathing After having made their tour the bride was again led to every matron round the rooms who saluted her with a compliment and a present some of jewels others of pieces of stuff handkerchiefs or little gallantries of that nature which she thanked them for by kissing their hands  We shall now entertain our readers with the ce∣remony of marriage among the Armenians at Con∣stantinople The lady is equally invisible as among the Turks and the contract is made by the friends and relations of the parties On the day fixed for celebrating the nuptials one of their priests goes to the house of the young lady and gives the nuptial benediction The bride is closely veiled during the whole time of the ceremony and when over the husband returns home at night the bride is brought to his house surrounded by her relations where she is conducted to an an apartment filled with women to partake of an entertainment the bridegroom en∣tains her male relations with those of his own in a chamber apart When the entertainment is over they all go except the bridegroom and pay their compliments to the bride to which the lady makes no  reply for was she to utter a syllable she would be deemed a bold wanton hussey after this she is con∣ducted to the nuptial chamber where the bridegroom is ready to receive her She still continues veiled and after they have placed her on a stool the company withdraw As soon as they are alone the bridegroom approaches the bride and whilst she is trembling with fear lifts up her veil it is then for the first time he beholds a face that is to be familiar to him for life Whatever may be his sentiments he no doubt conceals them and according to custom em∣braces her no return is made to his caresses but by a downcast look or by tears and as soon as possible she gives the first token of her submission by rising to fill a glass of wine and hand him some sweetmeats this done she fills another for herself the first she pre∣sents to her husband and then touching each others glasses they drink to their mutual happiness The bridegroom then undresses his bride and himself and the moment they are getting into bed contrives to give the signal for a concert of music which is im∣mediately performed in the antichamber accom∣panied by voices in honour of Hymen  We will close these details of the marriagecere∣mony in Turkey with Lady  Craven's  observations on their Harem or apartment for the ladies The Harem says she is sacred even to that rapacious  power which has seized the master's life only because he was too rich It may be said that in Turkey likewise women are safe from an idle curious im∣pertinent public and what is called the  world  can never disturb the ease and quiet of a Turkish wife Her talents her beauty her happiness or misery are equally concealed from malicious observersOf misery unless a Turkish woman is beyond exception unreasonable her portion cannot be very great for the wife whose wretched husband earns subsistence by carrying water or burthens sits at home bedecked with jewels or goes out as her fancy directs and the fruits of his labour are appropriated to her use In great houses the wives of the Turks who compose the train of a Turkish husband are destined to be subservient to the state of the first wife and she treats them as she pleases in her Harem  It is not the custom among the Turks to make enquiries about their wives and it would be con∣sidered the height of indecorum in Turkey to ask a Mahometan how his wife did  The art of medicine is very little known among the Turks being a very healthy people they need few physicians and it is not without some risk that they exercise their skill in this country for should their patients die under their hands they may be  accused of having killed them This excellent state of health which they enjoy is attributed to their frequent use of the baths and their extraordinary temperance In common disorders such as the headach toothach pains in the ear c they usually scarify lance or burn the part affected and this ge∣nerally proves a sovereign cure If we may credit Lord  Baltimore  the chirurgical art does not seem to be in the least countenanced in this country  There are few physicians fewer apothecaries and no surgeons here says his lordship the inhabitants therefore he concludes can know little of the horrid mischiefs occasioned by a certain disease we labour under in great cities  The first physician to the Grand Signor says  Peyson∣nel  is honoured with the title  Hekim Bachi Effendi  and wears the large round turban called Eurf the badge of the first class of the law professors No physician whatever native or foreigner can exercise that pro∣fession without his consent nor open a shop without his licence It may appear surprizing to our readers to hear of physicians opening a shop but such is the established custom at Constantinople and throughout all Turkey It is the practice of all the physicians who are Greeks or Jews and even many Europeans who are almost all apothecaries likewise The Grand  Signor in his indispositions frequently consults Euro∣pean physicians who when they are fortunate enough to obtain his confidence often acquire an influence in matters foreign to their profession but they are not allowed to administer any remedies to the Sultan without the consent and even presence of the  Hekim Bachi  to whom the care of the sovereign's health by right belongs  Those dreadful stories told of the plague says Lady  M  have very little foundation in truth I own I have much ado to reconcile myself to the sound of a word which has always given me such terrible ideas though I am convinced there is little more in it than in a fever As a proof of this we passed through two or three towns most violently infected In the very next house where we lay two persons died of it Luckily for me I was so well deceived that I knew nothing of the matter and was made to believe that our second cook had only a great cold However we left our doctor to take care of him and they both came to us afterwards in perfect health and I was then let into the secret that he had had the plague There are many that escape it neither is the air ever infected There can be no doubt it would be as easy a matter to root it out here as out of Italy and France but it does so little mischief they are not very solicitous about it and are con∣tent  to suffer this one distemper instead of our variety which they are utterly unacquainted with  Lord  B  likewise at the very beginning of his remarks on Constantinople has words to the same effect and first says he I can assuredly affirm that the plague there is not so dangerous as we imagine nor do I look upon it more contagious than other epidemic fevers besides mankind perish by such various invisible and unknown infections that the diseases incident to peculiar countries should never prevent a person of sense from visiting or residing in them  The smallpox which used to be so fatal in this country is entirely harmless in Turkey by the in∣vention of ingrafting which is the term they give to inoculation It is a set of old women there who make it their business to perform the operation which they do every autumn in the month of Sep∣tember when the great heat is abated People send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the smallpox they even make parties for this purpose and when they are met commonly fifteen or sixteen together the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of smallpox and asks what vein they please to have opened She immediately rips open that they offer  to her with a large needle which gives no more pain than a common scratch and puts into the vein as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle she then binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell and in this manner opens four or five veins The Greeks superstitiously open one in the middle of the forehead one in each arm and one on the breast to mark the sign of the cross but this has a very ill effect all these wounds leaving little scars and is not done by those that are not superstitious but who chuse to have them in the leg or that part of the arm that is concealed The effect which this in∣grafting produces is nearly similar to the effect it has in England and it is to her ladyship alone we owe this salutary custom having been introduced into this country The children or young patients play together all the rest of the day and are in perfect health to the eighth Then the fever begins to seize them and they keep their beds two days very seldom three They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces which never mark and in eight days time they are as well as before their illness Where they are wounded there remains running sores during the distemper which is no doubt a great relief to it So many thousands undergo this opera∣tion every year that they may be said to have the smallpox here by way of diversion as they take the wa∣ters  in other countries There is no example of any one dying of it  If a Mahometan is very seriously indisposed it is the custom in Turkey as in other countries for the priests to go and pray by him and if they find his end approaching to join with his friends in recommend∣ing a chearful submission to the Divine will against which it would be impious either to murmur or re∣pine On his death the women in the Harem set up such hideous howlings as if they were in the ago∣nies of despair Preparations are then made for his interment which are much the same as with us ex∣cept that the colour of the coffin in which the body is placed is painted differently according to the pro∣fession of the person to be interred if he was a sol∣dier it is red if of the family of  Mahomet  green and that of any other person some writers say white others black  Mourning says Baron  Tott  is not worn by the Turks but although this manner of paying respect to our deceased relations is certainly of little conse∣quence the haste with which they bury their dead certainly is not so It seems says he as if this na∣tion naturally so grave and plegmatic possessed ac∣tivity in that business alone They scarcely wait five or six hours before they perform this last duty to  their kindred and are not prevented by any fear lest those they bury should not be actually dead The misfortunes which result from this practice are scarce ever known Yet I have seen a Turk says the Baron taken up again who recovering from his insensibility had strength enough to cry out and make himself heard but he was still in some danger of becoming the victim of ceremony or rather of the dislike which the Judge and Iman discovered to restore the dues they had already received  To this abominable hurry in burying their dead the Turks who carry the bier add an extreme quick∣ness of pace Mahometans believing the deceased to remain in a suffering state till the end of this ceremony  Relations and friends attend the corps to the grave the priests marching in the van the women in the rear who every instant set up such piteous cries beat∣ing their breasts and tearing their hair as if sorrow had bereaved them of their senses When they come to the burial place the body contrary to the custom of this and other Christian countries is taken out of the coffin and put into the grave for the Turks never bury their dead in a coffin It is deposited in the ground in such a manner that the corps may sit upright to undergo the examination of the angels which are believed to resort to the grave to en∣quire  into the faith of the deceased The mourners then depart When the grave is filled up the poorer sort of people erect a stone over the head of the de∣deceased for the angel that examines them to sit upon  After the interment has taken place the women make frequent visits to to the tomb of the deceased where they pass several hours at a time The friends and relations likewise go there to pray to God that he would be pleased to deliver him from those pains which the black angels might inflict and calling him by his name they cry "Fear nothing answer boldly" for they have a notion that the soul returns again to the body and that as soon as any person is interred two black spirits of an hideous form come into the grave and take hold of the deceased by the tuft of hair which the Turks always leave on their head for this purpose and interrogate him in these words  Who is thy God What is thy religion Who is thy pro∣phet  To which he is to reply  My God is the true God my religion is the true religion and my prophet is  Mahomet But if the deceased is selfconvicted on account of the number of his sins then his guilt makes him cry out through fear  Thou art my God and my prophet and I believe in thee  Upon this reply they say one of the evil spirits gives him such a blow on the head with a bar of iron as drives him seven fathoms deep in the earth from which the other im∣mediately  draws him up again with an iron hook but no sooner is he drawn up than the first knocks him down again and so they continue tormenting him till the day of judgment  But if he returns a favourable answer the two black spirits instantly leave him and two others whiter than snow come in their place and seat themselves one at his head and the other at his feet where they stay by him till the day of judgment Many persons bring victuals and drink to the graves and leave it there for travellers that they may pray for the dead for whose sake it is there laid  The interment of the Grand Signor does not dif∣fer from that of others except in the importance of the great officers who accompany the body to the mosque Of the latter it is customary for each emperor to build one and in the court of the mosque a cupola is constructed under which the corpse is to be deposited and it is is to be remem∣bered that the Turkish emperors are buried with the same celerity as their subjects  The burial places for the dead are very numerous and in a manner surround Constantinople and Pera forming very shady romantic walks as the trees and gravestones are huddled together in a confused  manner both presenting great variety to those who ramble among them It is difficult to give a just idea of the beauty of the trees which particularly in these burial places are never touched they spread therefore and grow in the most luxuriant and graceful disorder There are no fences to restrain or mark the form of their burial places some extend a mile or two and if it was not for one disagreeable reflexion would be as pleasant to a foreigner as a Turk but when it is considered that it is pestiferated earth we tread on that every fresh grave may contain a body rotting with the plague and likewise the slight man∣ner in which it is covered with earth from the hurry it is thrown in no one can with prudence remain for any time among them  The Turks who are predestinarians and therefore imagine that it is to be fate and not the precaution taken by Christians which prevents their falling a sa∣crifice to this fatal disorder walk unconcerned under the dangerous shades of trees that hang over their deceased neighbour  It is surprising says Lady  M  what a vast quantity of land is lost this way in Turkey Sometimes I have seen burying places of several miles belonging to very inconsiderable villages which were formerly great towns and retain no other mark of their an∣cient  A TURKISH CEMETERY  grandeur than this dismal one On no occa∣sion do they ever remove a stone that serves for a monument Some of them are costly enough being of very fine marble They set up a pillar with a carved turban on the top of it to the memory of a man and as the turbans by their different shapes shew the quality or profession it is in a manner putting up the arms of the deceased Besides the pillar com∣monly bears an inscription in golden letters reciting their virtues The ladies have a simple pillar with∣out other ornament except those that die unmarried who have a rose on the top of their monument The sepulchres of particular families are railed in and planted round with trees  The sight of the tombs surrounded by cypresses and the immense extent of ground peaceably occu∣pied by the dead so near to where the living reside fills the mind with a kind of gloom which is often inexpressibly pleasing Alas are we born then to die And was not  Homer  in the right to compare men to the leaves of the trees None but the Turkish burial places are allowed to be ornamented with cy∣presses Those of the Jews Armenians and Greeks are surrounded with mulberry trees and poplars  Their tombstones are of marble and thus it is that the finest marbles of antiquity announce now the remains of some obscure individual I have seen  says  Bisani  Cadies walking about them melancholy and disconsolate and am told that the Greeks and Armenians are accustomed to spend their festivals among them after having been to weep there the day before This custom of planting trees round the tombs is very ancient for we read even as far back as  Homer  that  Aelion  's tomb was adorned with elms  CHAP XI  Commerce Manufactures and Coins  THE Turks carry on very little commerce be∣yond the confines of the Ottoman Empire One branch of their trade consists in their navigation of the Black Sea with two kinds of vessels called  Caiques  and  Voligues  the cargoes of these differ according to the parts for which they are designed The trade to the coast of Asia in the vicinity of the river  Fasti  is confined chiefly to wood for fuel and for building For the European coasts the cargoes consist of coals and from more distant territories near the Danube they bring corn beeswax and cattle  The Crimea abounds in oxen small cattle wax honey butter and corn all necessary articles for  which there is a constant demand to supply the mar∣ket of Constantinople and a considerable profit is derived from this traffic But the most considerable branch of trade is that carried on by the Mediter∣ranean sea in a species of Turkish vessel called  Cayrines  Drugs and coffee are transported by the Red Sea to Suez and from thence upon camels to Cairo from Cairo they are forwarded by the Nile to Dalmatia Rousset or Alexandria and from thence to Constantinople The woollen cloths worn by the common people are fabricated at Salonica Fine cloths were formerly manufactured at Constantinople but that manufactory is lost either through want of skill in the conduct or which is more probable through the intrigues of the French agents Cam∣blets are made in Natolia a country abounding in fine wool the rich silk girdles and other beautiful silk manufactures are wrought at Scio in the Archi∣pelago The cotton stuffs are manufactured at Alex∣andria and Cyprus and linen cloths in almost every part of Turkey  All the islands of the Archipelago furnish wines Tinos has its silk manufactories Damascus and Aleppo their soap manufactories and silk fabrics Diarbekir its red morocco The prices of all these commodities are regulated by custom and the dis∣cretion  of the dealers who are in general satisfied with small profit  Thus we see the principal commerce of the Turks consists in transporting the commodities of the dif∣ferent provinces of the empire either in their natural or improved state from one place to another they are not willing to run any risk or hazard for greater advantages In general they are idle superstitious and haughty idleness confines them in their shops and warehouses superstition and pride prevent their leaving their own country to travel into others in∣habited by infidels to the hazard of losing the Maho∣metan faith and corrupting their pure morals This is the language of the chief part of the Turks in other respects persons of the highest reputation for integrity  With respect to the conquered nations a great many of the Greeks are employed in the commerce of the Black Sea and there are some hundreds of Caiques solely belonging to that people The rest who have not the means of carrying on this branch of traffic employ themselves in the retail trade with the foreign merchants established at Constantinople  The Armenians on the contrary never risk any thing by sea and the most considerable trade they  carry on consists in jewels which they buy rough of the Europeans and fashion to the Eastern taste a traffic that produces them very considerable advan∣tages The Jews do not engage in navigation them∣selves but risk great capitals carrying on some com∣merce with all the nations of Europe Many of them are physicians and exercise their function by permission of the physician of the Grand Signor who is almost the only constituent of the University of Constantinople and on whom all those who exercise the medical skill depend except the European phy∣sicians A great number of Jews are brokers for all kinds of merchandise The Persians formerly carried on a very great traffic at Constantinople but that trade is now very much on the decline  The trade from England to Turkey is carried on by a limited number of English merchants dependent on the Turkey company of London who consign to them by a single annual convoy such articles of com∣merce as they judge may be easily sold or exchanged the quantity is always in proportion to the wants of Turkey and they take particular care never to overstock the market This precaution prevents their experiencing any loss from a glut of merchan∣dise and supports that great repute which the mer∣chandise from England has always enjoyed The chief articles of their trade are lead tin watches  all kinds of clockwork hard ware woollen cloths spice and china The attention of those persons says  Habesci  who are deputed as factors for this trade in Turkey and who carry it on with an exact observance of the rules and laws which they are to go by is worthy of imitation Further it consists chiefly of articles of great value the sale of which is certain This is the reason that all the English houses esta∣blished in Turkey are rich An English merchant who died lately at Pera Mr  Parker  left immense riches to his heirs His country seat alone was va∣lued at purses each purse £  s    d  by the Captain Bashaw who desired to purchase it At Constantinople there is no merchandise to load back to England the ships are in general obliged to take in their loading at Smyrna which consists in raw cot∣ton wool Bursa silk and a great deal of Angora hair for camblets The caravans which used to come from Persia to Smyrna with great quantities of silk have ceased coming since the Russians have been al∣lowed a free navigation on the Caspian Sea from whence they transport this silk to Astracan and from thence it goes to Petersburgh This is the reason that the English at present very frequently fall short in their cargoes homeward both at Smyrna and Aleppo  The Dutch trade is very much on the decline to what it used to be and that which they have now in any  of the ports of the Levant is but very trifling The private interest of individuals has ruined the Dutch trade in Turkey which though formerly very flou∣rishing is now nearly annihilated  The commerce which the Russians carry on at Constantinople and other parts of Turkey though but little noticed is by far the most advantageous and considerable of the European nations it con∣sists principally of skins of every kind to make Turkish pellisses All kinds of people of every age and sex wear pellisses in Turkey The sale which the Russians have in them is incredible and some bear very high prices Black fox and ermine skins are more esteemed than any of the rest and a small quantity of these two species of furs amounts to a very large capital The Russians take nothing in return but Morocco leather oranges lemon juice and dried fruits It is on the Black Sea that this trade is carried on and as by the last treaty of peace the Russians have permission to pass in∣to the Mediterranean they go to the islands of the Archipelago in order to load back with wine and the other products of those islands No other nation whatever has been able to obtain the per∣mission of the Porte to trade upon the Black Sea though the Court of France has made repeated ef∣forts for that purpose  The Germans have for a long time been endea∣vouring to establish a trade with the Turks which might be accomplished three ways by land by the Danube or from Triest down the Adriatic Those articles however with which they could trade to any advantage are of great weight or bulk and conse∣quently must incur larger expences in the freight besides being already imported by other nations into Turkey in great abundance as iron cotton steel c c and from the quality of these merchandises it may be deduced that their trade with the Turks will ever be of little importance  It is but very lately that the Swedes and Neapoli∣tans have sent ministers to the Porte in the charac∣ters of Envoys extraordinary with a view to establish a commercial intercourse with Turkey The Swedes have just made a beginning by sea A single ship arrives every year at Constantinople laden with iron and some other trifling products of the barren soil of Sweden But there are a great number of Swedish vessels employed in transporting the Turkish merchandise to different parts of the Ottoman Em∣pire and particularly to the coast of Barbary from whence a very considerable profit is derived though the Swedes who navigate these vessels are to be considered as carriers rather than mer∣chants  The Neapolitans carry to Turkey a species of silk stuff worked at Messina and by the Turks called Zebins for which there is a great demand on ac∣count of their beautiful appearance though they are very slight and quickly change colour The returns are small and of little consequence the ballance therefore is in their favour  But the richest and by far the most regular of all the European commerce established in Turkey is that of the French The value of their commerce with the Turks is estimated to exceed twenty millions of Turkish piastres a year which admitting a Turkish piastre to be equal to four shillings makes above four millions sterling annually The principal article of their commerce is cloth of which they send out three sorts all very acceptable to the Turks the price being always lower than that of English cloths the colours also are more lively and durable  This commerce is carried on by French merchants established even in the very villages of Turkey they depend however on the chamber of commerce at Marseilles and can remain only a limited time after which they must return to France and give up their business to others No individual among these mer∣chants can dispose of his cloths without the prior knowledge and permission of his ambassador or con∣sul  because the sale must be made in equal propor∣tion among them by these means all underminings and deceptions are prevented that might sap the foundation of so valuable a branch of trade  There is a general bank for the whole French nation established in every seaport of the Levant to which all the French merchants who reside in Turkey pay a certain tax in proportion to the cloth they sell and which is no great burthen upon them considering their great profits From the funds of these banks many advantages arise among others that of insuring the capitals of the merchants in France because in cases of bankruptcy part of their loss is refunded to them from the common stock It likewise defrays the extraordinary expences of the nation for the hotels of the French ambas∣sador or consul in Turkey and for the maintenance of many poor families there By this institution the economical administration finds its account there and the nation its interest tranquility and honor The French likewise derive another advantage which consists in transporting merchandise on account of the Turks from one seaport to another And in every little seaport and small town the French have a consul or viceconsul to promote and protect their commerce  Baron  de Tott  who was sent a few years since by the French ministry to the Levant as Inspector Ge∣neral of the French commerce in Turkey made several alterations in these particulars This Baron  de Tott  says  Habesci  was as much in the interest of the Turks as of his own country and consequently was well paid by both parties He passed for a man of great abilities but adds  Habesci  I had the oppor∣tunity of studying his character during three months at Smyrna Being employed to inspect the com∣merce of that seaport his time was more deeply engaged in paying his court to a Greek lady who was married to a very unfortunate but very honest Frenchman and this lady made the Baron commit a number of follies very unworthy of an Inspector General The French consul at Smyrna M  Pey∣sonnel  whose remarks on the Turks we have already frequently had occasion to introduce and which ap∣pear to carry with them great discernment and can∣dour seems to have fallen the victim of Baron  de Tott  's endeavours to please this lady M  Peysonnel  adds  Habesci  merited rather to fill the place of the Baron than to be dismissed by one so much his in∣ferior in abilities Good luck and certain other circumstances of which he is not ignorant occasioned his promotion In France such promotions are common as well as in other countries where their manners are adopted  The Venetians were formerly the richest European Merchants established in Turkey But other nations have since turned to their advantage the disgraces and losses which fell upon them by their frequent wars with the Porte The manufactures which have been esta∣blished in different parts of Europe have likewise been of great prejudice to them but what injured their commerce most materially as well with the Turkish as with other states was the navigation of the Dutch and other powers to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope At present their commerce with the Turks is confined to a small quantity of gold stuffs and a species of damask called  Damasquetti  which is worn by almost every family in Turkey  There is no doubt that the commerce of the Eu∣ropeans with Turkey is so very disadvantageous to Turks as to be one cause of the decline of the em∣pire The merchandise carried into Turkey is very valuable and what is exported not the least so The merchants therefore established in Turkey having no articles of commerce to export equal in value to what is imported into the country are obliged to make their returns in gold money and diamonds and by these means the country is impoverished The most valuable Turkish coin is the  Foncli  ducat of very fine gold equal in value with the Venetian ducat Four or five millions of these  ducats says  Habesci  are sent every year out of the kingdom One may judge therefore how many millions of these pieces of gold must have gone out of the country for these two last centuries There is no law to prohibit the exportation of specie from the Turkish dominions The eunuchs the vizier the great officers of state and even the Grand Sig∣nor himself all contribute to ruin the empire for they are fond of accumulating great riches they are continually receiving money and scarcely ever parting with it again it follows then that these great sums which are so hoarded up must con∣siderably impede the circulation of money in Tur∣key  The tyranny of their government destroys that happy security which is the mother of arts industry and commerce and such is the debasement of the human mind when borne down by hardships and op∣pression that all the great advantages of commerce which nature has as it were thrown under the feet of the inhabitants of this country are neglected The Turks command the navigation of the Red Sea which opens a communication with all the riches of the Indies Their capital is seated on a neck of land that separates Europe from Asia and communicates on the South with the Mediterranean sea which opens a passage to all the European nations as well  as to the coast of Africa The same strait commu∣nicating northwards with the Black Sea opens a pas∣sage by means of the Danube and other rivers into the interior parts of Germany Poland and Russia  Yet in this extensive empire with all these advan∣tages for a foreign commerce and where all the com∣modities necessary for manufactures of every kind are produced the Turks content themselves with working up on a very confined scale the few trifling articles of cottons carpets leather and soap The most valuable of their commodities such as silk a variety of drugs and dying stuffs they generally ex∣port raw and unmanufactured  It appears from  Peysonnel  's strictures on Baron  Tott  that Lord  Baltimore  errs in supposing Constan∣tinople to be a free port The duties indeed are very low which makes it next to a free port being not more according to  Peysonnel  then two per cent and all merchandise is besides estimated much inferior to its real value It is to be observed further adds Mr  P  that this duty once paid every European merchant provided with a  Tasham  or quittance from the officer may convey his goods to any part of the empire without paying any thing more No extor∣tions are practised in the customs on account of the Tariff and disputes with the officers are very rare  We should not omit to mention the lenity with which the laws in Turkey treat those who deal in contraband commodities When any such goods are seized and carried to the customhouse the pro∣prietor may claim them again on paying double duty  The Turks seem likewise to have shewn great generosity to the French merchants at a time when the plague made great ravage in the capital in suf∣fering their merchandise to be immediately conveyed to the magazines without undergoing any examina∣tion accepting the customs according to their own declaration Of this very honourable generosity some of the French merchants had the meanness to take advantages notwithstanding the menaces of their ambassador by daring to give in unjust accounts to the chief commissioner of the customs who though he had too much sense to discover the fraud disdained to make any complaint We are happy in seeing no charge of this kind made against our own nation  The Turks can never make any great progress in the fine arts while they adhere to the dictates of their religion as the laws of Mahomet forbid their sketching the human figure in any shape They paint flowers however and other ornamental figures to  admiration There are also shops in Constantinople where they engrave cornelians and other sorts of stones the Turks have likewise an art of polish∣ing their horn so as to make it look like tortoiseshell and this they manufacture into spoons it being contrary to the precepts of their alcoran as we have before observed to make use of silver ones Their sabres are also in very great esteem all over Europe the temper of their steel in all articles of their cutlery being superior to that of all other countries Another principal manufacture which they have unrivalled in point of excellence is their Morocco or Turkey leather Their embroideries in gold and silver on this leather are worked with great taste and elegance They particularly excel in their pocketbooks which are embroidered all round the edges in a very superb manner There are in Galata a great number of shops which deal only in this article so much are they in esteem by all foreigners who resort to Turkey To those arts and manufactures on which the Turks deign to bestow any time or attention like the an∣cient Greeks from whom they are said to have descended they infinitely surpass all other nations in the beauty skill and excellencies of their work∣manship  The gold and large silver coin of all countries is current in Turkey The proper coins of the coun∣try  are first those of gold namely the  altines  or ducats which are about seven shillings each and the zechinos worth about nine shillings Secondly of the silver the zeloti is worth about two shillings and twopence farthing the krip nearly a shilling the grosh is worth about threepence the para worth about three aspers and the aspers says  Busching  about one penny halfpenny  Tott  calculates them at not more than a farthing A purse contains five hundred rixdollars or one hundred and eight pounds six shillings and eightpence In their com∣merce they reckon by piastres as we do by pounds sterling A piastre in Turkey is equivalent to four shillings English  The silver coin in Turkey used formerly to be at such a very high standard that the remittance of it to Europe was found more advantageous than any other article of exportation from the Le∣vant A French merchant having satisfied himself by an assay of the justness of this speculation con∣verted the produce of all the merchandise he had sold into piastres and zelottes which he melted down and remitting the silver to France found the profits fully answer his expectation His success encouraged him to continue this practice and he might have made an immense fortune by it had he not divulged his secret but not being able to resist the vanity of  boasting of his lucky thought others taking the hint presently imitated him Their example was soon fol∣lowed by all the French and foreign merchants not only  Co  stantinople but in all the seaports of the Levant and this destruction of the silver coin so eagerly practised by the European merchants who traded to Turkey diminished the currency to such a degree that the Porte perceived it and found out the cause The Ottoman ministers then resolved to reduce the coin to so low a standard that no person was afterwards tempted either to melt it down or to send it abroad  CHAP XII  Of their Religion  THE Turks are of the Mahometan religion and appropriate to themselves the name of  Moslemin  which has been strangely corrupted into  Muselman  signifying persons professing the doctrine and pre∣cepts of  Mahammed  A great difference of opinion prevails among the Mahometan doctors with re∣spect to the interpretation of these precepts Maho∣metism is divided into as many sects as Christianity and its first institution as much neglected and ob∣scured  by interpretations But none are so opposite and contrary to each other as the comments of  Omar  and  Ali  who in fact instituted two religions the followers of which became bitter enemies to each other The Turks in general have adopted the ex∣planation of  Omar  and the Persians that of  Ali  The creed of  Omar  being then the established religion of the Ottoman Empire we shall confine ourselves here to that alone  The first article of their faith is that there is but one God and that  Mahomet  is his prophet no Turk must expect eternal salvation unless he firmly adheres to this doctrine There are also five pre∣cepts of practical duty enjoined to constitute a good Muselman which are called the fundamentals of their religion The first is ablution the second prayer which must be performed five times every day the third is the observation of the fast of Ramadan or Ramazan the fourth is to give alms indiscrimi∣nately and lastly to perform at least once in their lives the pilgrimage to Mecca  To these principal and essential articles a great number of others are added of an inferior obliga∣tion such as abstaining from pork and wine keep∣ing Friday holy as we do Sunday in our church and in being circumcised  Ablution is the first of their indispensable duties It is divided into three distinct species The first is that performed preparatory to entering a Mosque or before prayers The manner of performing it is thisThey begin with washing both hands re∣peating at the same time these words"Praised be God who has created clean water and has given it the virtue to purify us and render our faith illus∣trious" After this they take some water in their right hand three times and wash their mouths say∣ing"I pray thee O Lord to let me taste of that water which thou hast given to thy prophet in Pa∣radisemore odoriferous than muskwhiter than milksweeter than honey and which has the power to quench for ever the thirst of him who drinks of it" This done they snuff a little water up the nos∣trils and say "Grant O Lord that I may smell the sweet odours of Paradise and enjoy them and suffer me not to breathe those of hell" Then they wash their faces three times all round and behind their ears saying "Make clean my face O Lord and that of those who obey thee that they may resemble thy prophets in the day of judgment" Water is then taken with the right hand and thrown up to the elbow three times repeating "Give me O Lord at the last day the book of my good works into my right hand and pardon my offences" The same operation being performed with the left hand during the repe∣tition  of a similar sentence The crown of the head is then washed repeating "Let thy mercy surround me O Lord when I shall appear before thee" Water is now taken up with both hands and the orifice of the ears washed with the thumbs repeat∣ing "Make me O Lord one of those thy ser∣vants who hearken to what is written in the sacred books and obey thy commandments" Finally with all the fingers they wash the neck saying "Deliver me O Lord God from hell and from the chains put round the neck and feet of sinners" The feet of course are washed during this ejaculation but it is sufficient to be done externally over the sandals or short boots which they wear and the ceremony fi∣nishes with "Hold me up firmly O Lord and suffer not my feet to slip lest I fall over the bridge into hell" The Turks believe there is a bridge to pass over in order to get to paradise as narrow as the edge of a knife and that hell lies under this bridge The prayer which concludes this general ablution is "Accept my prayers O Lord pardon my sins re∣ceive the offerings I have made and do not permit the prayers I have said to be fruitless"  The second species of ablution is used with the warm bath when they rise in the morning after they have passed the night in their Harams  The third consists in ablutions after easing the ne∣cessities of nature some are even so scrupulous to perform this ceremony after breaking wind  With respect to public prayers as the alcoran or∣ders them to be said five times in the space of twen∣tyfour hours the first begins at daybreakthe se∣cond at noonthe third exactly between noon and the setting sunthe fourth immediately after sun setand the fifth an hour and a half afterwards Each mosque having turrets persons appointed for that purpose as hath before been remarked ascend them and cry out with a loud and intelligible voice at each stated time that it is the hour of prayers The ve∣neration attention and true spirit of devotion with which the Turks perform their prayers from first to last is highly praiseworthy Nothing is capable of diverting their attention which is carried to such a superstitious extreme that if they happen to cough or sneeze they begin all their prayers again and go over them with the greatest patience as often as such an accident happens The different positions of their bodies and their contortions whilst praying are numberless They will extend their arms place their hands upon their ears bend their bodies kneel prostrate themselves and sometimes put their foreheads to the ground like the Indians and Chinese  The Turks says  Le Brun  very seldom miss these five hours of prayer but especially the first and the last two for should it be discovered that out of the five times enjoined them for prayers they do not perform them at least three times they would be severely punished Nor is there any dispensation that will avail them in this particular If they cannot go to the mosque they are obliged to say their prayers wherever they are and even when on a journey they must allight from their horses at the stated hours of prayer If they are travelling in company with a caravan the master of it makes a halt and turn∣ing towards Mecca either calls out himself or or∣ders some other person to give notice that it is the hour of prayer upon which all the Turks allight and begin their prayers Christians who are with the caravan are permitted to keep on their horses but they are not allowed to go forward till the others have finished their prayers unless they are the more numerous party for in that case the Turks themselves turn out of the road to pray  The third article of a Muselman's faith is an ob∣servance of the fast of Ramazan so called from the name of a lunar month From break of day whilst this month lasts the Turks neither eat drink smoke or smell any odour in short they do no∣thing to administer pleasure to the five senses till sun∣set  Such is the law and those who transgress it are punished very severely even with death if the of∣fence has caused scandal Formerly in the height of their religious zeal the violaters of the fast of Ramazan had melted lead poured down their throats at present either the Turks are more strict or the zeal of their superiors is abated for this bar∣barous punishment is no longer heard of But it may be easily conceived that the night is turned into day during the Ramazan for the Turks are of too indolent a disposition to work when they do not eat so that they sleep through most of the day It is said in the alcoran that during this month they may eat and drink all night long till they can dis∣cern a white thread from a black by the morning light  The fourth article of their creed obliges them to give the tenth part of their income to the poor But this precept is not so well observed as the former by those who have considerable revenues and this is one reason among others why the opulent Turks endeavour to conceal their riches from the public  The fifth and last article is the pilgrimage to Mecca which is held to be of such importance that he who from bad health or the state of his affairs  cannot undertake it though the law may exempt him thinks himself very unfortunate  The pilgrims for Mecca set out from Constanti∣nople in the month of May and repair to Damascus where they join the other pilgrims from Natolia and Asia Afterwards they unite with those that come from Persia Egypt and other parts of the Ottoman Empire The whole number commonly amounts to sixty thousand though Sir  James Porter  makes their number amount to two hundred thou∣sand but this is a great error and must mean to in∣clude all the trading and other travellers who either for safety or convenience travel with the caravan yet reckoning these with the suttlers and slaves the whole will not amount to this enormous number At a small distance from Mecca there is a mountain on which the pilgrims offer up sacrifices to God in ho∣nour of  Mahomet  by sacrificing some sheep upon altars the flesh of which is given to the poor The day after the sacrifice the pilgrims before they ascend the mountain again strip off their usual cloathing and put on the coarsest dress that can be conceived to shew they renounce the pomp and va∣nities of the world and aspire only to paradise They are obliged to walk round the outside of the temple seven times and then going out of the city by the gate they entered every one takes up a stone  and slings it to a certain distance to denote his contempt for all other religions In the temple of Mecca they kiss the black stone which fell from heaven to point out the spot on which the Temple should be built it was originally white they tell you but being re∣peatedly polluted by the lips of sinners it has long since been changed to a jet black Its virtue consists in absolving those who kiss it with devout faith from all their sins  The temple of Mecca is magnificent and rich in the centre is the tomb of  Mahomet  which the com∣mon people believe to be suspended in the air The Grand Signor sends every year to this temple five hundred Venetian ducats an alcoran bound in gold and a rich gold embroidered stuff to cover the tomb of the prophet When the new covering is put on the old one is cut into small pieces and delivered to the faithful who preserve it with the greatest vene∣ration  According to  Peysonnel  the Sultan sends two co∣verings one to Mecca and the other to Medina together with the other royal offerings designed for those holy places These are carried by the  Surra Emini  or Intendant of Alms who is likewise to take charge of the money arising from legacies be∣queathed by individuals The first covering is in∣tended  for the  Beith Oullah  or house of God at Mecca which is the grand object of the pilgrimage and is commonly called the  Kiaba  or Cube be∣cause its form is a perfect cube This covering is a black woolen stuff without any ornament The  Sur∣ra Emini  who carries the new one brings back the old and presents it to the Emperor who distri∣butes the pieces of it to the grandees and his fa∣vourites These pieces are held in the highest ve∣neration and those who obtain them give orders that at their burial their heads shall be covered with them in the coffin and care is taken to let these pre∣cious fragments appear on the outside over the rich stuff which covers the bier in the funerals of the great The second covering is of silk and gold and is carried to Medina to the tomb which it is designed to envelop  Devotions being ended the pilgrims return to Damascus in the same order they arrived Many of these pilgrims make repeated journies to Mecca not for devotion but to purchase merchandise which is there to be bought very cheap And as it is per∣mitted for any one who cannot perform the pilgri∣mage in person to send a deputy there are others who make a traffic of these pious deputations They are maintained and fed by those who send them for whom they perform the customary prayers and  sacrifices these people generally take great care to conceal the name and quality of their employers by which stratagem one deputy will obtain a great num∣ber of these devout commissions In short it is a profession that affords a very comfortable livelihood  The caravans of pilgrims to Mecca used to be held sacred by the Arabs and even by common robbers However a few years since the caravan from Persia to Mecca was attacked It was cus∣tomary for the caravan to take conductors from a particular tribe of Arabs encamped in the environs of Bassora whose chief received a certain sum for protecting the caravan to Damascus and this tribe was one of the most powerful among the Arabs It happened in the year that in the caravan from Bassora to Damascus there was the daughter of  Kerim Kan  a powerful Persian prince accompanied by a train of ladies all very rich The chief of the tribe observing the great splendour and riches of this caravan and the quality of the pilgrims demanded a more considerable sum than usual to protect them which they refused to pay and addressed themselves to the chief of another tribe who agreed to protect them for the same sum they had formerly paid The caravan accordingly set out from Bassora but when it had reached the heart of the desart through which it was obliged to pass the chief of the first tribe with  his followers suddenly fell upon the Arabs who guarded it of whom they made great slaughter the pilgrims were then all stripped the daughter of  Kerim Kan  not excepted and after having plundered the caravan the travellers were afterwards left to pursue their journey to Damascus where they arrived in a most wretched plight I saw one of the company a merchant says  Habesci  who but a few days before was in possession of five hundred thousand piastres which is between twenty and thirty thousand pounds reduced to the necessity of asking charity This ad∣venture made the fortune of a Frenchman who re∣sided at Tripoly in Syria for the princess being unable to borrow money from the Turks from their enmity to the Persians the Frenchman generously offered her his purse which she accepted and when she returned home  Kerim Kan  remitted him not only the original sum he had advanced but double interest and such magnificent presents that the French merchant was enriched for the remainder of his life  Kerim Kan  sent ambassadors to the Porte to com∣plain of this daring outrage and demand satisfac∣tion it being the duty of the Grand Signor to pro∣vide for the safety of the caravans that go to Mecca while they are upon his territories but the Porte only gave evasive answers and alledged that the  Arabs were rebels and that the tribe who had com∣mitted this outrage inhabited the territory of Bas∣sora which was subject to the government of Bagdat it therefore belonged to the Bashaw of that city to indemnify him  Kerim Kan  enraged at this answer marched his troops to Bassora which he took and plundered the riches he amassed by this expedi∣tion were immense and not being satisfied he di∣rected his course to Bagdat which he likewise be∣sieged and kept blocked up six months when the Grand Signor agreed to give him ample satisfaction and a peace was concluded I was at Constanti∣nople says  Habesci  when the Ambassador from  Kerim Kan  arrived and observed he had audience of the Grand Signor without loss of timeTo re∣turn to the religious tenets of the Turks it remains only to remark that circumcision is not enjoined by the alcoran but is only a ceremony which the Turks perform as an ancient custom derived from their ancestors  With respect to the precepts which forbid the drink∣ing of wine and eating of pork I can take upon me to affirm says  Habesci  that they have only a nominal exist∣ence Friday which should be considered as a day of particular devotion is now converted into a day of recreation And it is on this day that the public houses of entertainment are filled with Turks who  eat and drink to excess of every thing that is for∣bidden The Turks at Constantinople adds the same author drink more wine than is consumed at Paris and the importation of this article alone yields a larger revenue than any other branch of commerce whatever  We scarce know how to credit this assertion that wine is not prohibited by the alcoran Lady  M  in her remarks on the religion of the Turks begins with observing "tis certain we have but very imper∣fect accounts of the manners and religion of this people This part of the world being seldom visited but by merchants who mind little but their own af∣fairs or travellers who make too short a stay to be able to report any thing exactly of their own know∣ledge The Turks are too proud to converse fami∣liarly with merchants who can give no better ac∣count of their ways here than a French refugee liv∣ing in a garret in Grubstreet can of the court of England I had the advantage she adds of lodg∣ing three weeks at Belgrade with a principal Ef∣fendi that is to say a scholar and an intimate daily conversation with him gave me an opportunity of knowing their religion and morals in a more particular manner than perhaps any Christian ever did This man she says made no scruple of de∣viating from some part of  Mahomet  's law by drink∣ing  wine with the same freedom we did When I asked him how he came to allow himself this liberty he made answer that all the creatures of God are good and designed for the use of man however that the prohibition of wine was a very wise maxim and meant for the common people being the source of all disorders amongst them but that the Prophet never designed to confine those who knew how to use it with moderation nevertheless he said that scandal ought to be avoided and that he never drank it in public This is the general way of thinking amongst them and very few forbear drinking wine that are able to afford it"  It appears therefore from this extract taken from Lady  M  that wine is prohibited by the Turkish law notwithstanding its being drunk to such excess as af∣firmed by the former writer  Le Brun  likewise gives the reason why it was pro∣hibited that  Mahomet  in passing through a village observed great rejoicing at a wedding and that wine was the occasion of the mirth which made him drink it very copiously But that returning back the next day by the same road he saw the marks of a great deal of blood having been spilt and con∣jecturing that those persons whom he had seen so convivial together the day before had fallen out  and wounded each other he forbid the free use of wine and recommended his followers never to drink of it in future but by way of physic  The grand festival of the Turks is the Bayram corresponding to the Easter of the Christians It begins the moment the new moon can be discovered which succeeds that of the Ramazan Happy is the man who can first discover it for which he is amply rewarded by the Mufti or Grand Visir and the tidings are immediately made public by a general discharge of artillery and music instantly striking up The common people then leave their work go about congratulating each other and betake themselves to different amusements every counte∣nance expressing uncommon satisfaction and pleasure during the three days that this festival continues The first morning after the new moon the Grand Signor sets out as soon as it is light for the principal mosque in Constantinople attended by his whole court in the most superb dresses and as he passes along throws money to the populace and at the mosque sacrifices three sheep His return from the place of worship is accompanied with equal splendor after which he enters the divan chamber and seats himself on the throne to receive the compliments of the Grand Visir and all the officers of state with the whole body of ecclesiastics who all prostrate  themselves at the foot of the throne crying "May the days of the Sultan be happy" The last person who pays his respects is the Agha of the Janissaries who on his return home is attended by a retinue as splendid as that of the Grand Signor Every Turkish lord receives the same compliments that day from his inferiors  The Sultanas who are shut up in the old seraglio have the liberty likewise on that day to pay their respects to the Grand Signor and to visit the Sultanamothers it is therefore the pleasantest day to them of the whole year for they are permitted to walk in the delicious gardens of the seraglio and may obtain any little favour they ask of the monarch The principal personages of the empire dine on that day at the seraglio on a particular invitation from the Sultan but he does not eat with them Before they partake of this entertainment sixteen of the principal officers of state are robed by the Sultan himself with rich pellices or caftans a ceremony corresponding with the investiture of the different orders of knighthood by the other princes of Eu∣rope This solemnity ended the Grand Signor withdraws to the interior part of the seraglio Se∣venty days after the Grand Bayram there is another festival called the Little Bayram The Sultan goes to the mosque with the same ceremony on the first  day of this festival as he does on that of the other and sacrifices three sheep with this difference that the sheep must be larger than for the Grand Bayram and painted of all sorts of colours they must like∣wise have the sign of the half moon or crescent on them these sheep are placed at a small distance from the door of the mosque it being required that the Grand Signor should kill one of them with his own hand before he enters the mosque Every person of fortune kills some sheep on that day as a sacrifice The Little Bayram lasts three days but the sacrifice of sheep is only on the first whereas on the Grand Bayram every day is a day of sa∣crifice  The most magnificent and the largest edifices at Constantinople are the mosques They are almost all built upon the same plan having a dome and minarets that is to say a kind of turrets from which the inferior Imans call the people to prayers At the stated hours appointed for that purpose they go up to these minarets and in those mosques which have none stand at the porch and clapping their thumbs to their ears call out with a loud voice in Arabic  Alla Hecbar  which signifies "God is great" this they repeat several times and then invite the people to prayers in those mosques where there are several minarets filled with people crying out  altogether very loud and in different tones so many voices make a symphony very pleasing to the ears of Mahometans  Though the voice of these criers does not sound so loud as the ringing of bells which is not permitted by their religion yet coaches not being in use in the streets of Constantinople nor any trades carried on in that city the noise of which deafens the ear their notes which are generally pretty shrill easily pass through all the quarters of the city and may be heard at a considerable distance The good mussul∣men take great delight in ascending the minarets to assist these Imans in their holy office There are a great number of these mosques called royal ones but they are only to be found in the cities of Bursa Adrianople and Constantinople as having been the residence of the Sultans The fixed revenues of the principal one that of St Sophia which we have already so amply described amount to fifty thousand pounds sterling The revenues of these mosques are by no means either equal or certain as some depend on pensions from the Sultan or contribu∣tions from the people and others on the lands of villages sometimes of whole provinces The people inhabiting places obliged to contribute from the pro∣duce of their lands to the support of the mosques enjoy very great privileges among which is an ex∣emption  from quartering of soldiers or any other person in the service of the prince To be sensible of the value of this privilege it is necessary to remark that the military and other persons em∣ployed in the Grand Signor's service are very numerous and almost always in motion so that the countries through which they travel are ruined by them for they are very oppressive and insist on being treated almost as well as the monarch himself  The mosques founded by private persons cannot confer these privileges because they have no reve∣nues arising from land their whole income arises from the interest of sums lent which is eighteen per cent this privilege of lending money on interest being granted only to the mosques and the Jews for the Mahometan laws strictly forbid this way of traffic in any other instances under penalty of losing the principal if discovered  To build a mosque is not a custom followed indifferently by all the Turkish emperors since all have not a right that being only to be acquired by conquest The Sultan before he can build a tem∣ple within the walls of Constantinople must have gained some victory over the enemies of the empire or have extended the Ottoman possessions and there∣fore merited the surname of  Gazi  or conqueror  Sultan  Mahmoud  who had legally acquired this right by gaining the battle of Grosca against the Ger∣mans and taking Belgrade erected a very beautiful one within the capital When he had resolved on raising this edifice he procured from Italy France and England the most elegant designs and models to be found in Europe proper for his undertaking From these that prince who possessed great abilities and taste formed himself the plan of his mosque which he shewed to the Ulemas or body of eccle∣siastics and lawyers united They objected that it more resembled a Christian church than a mosque and advised their master to give it a form more agree∣able to the Mahometan taste that it might not of∣fend the common people Sultan  Mahmoud  obliged to give way to the insinuations of the heads of the law produced a monstrous mixture of the European and Turkish style though still magnificent and ele∣gant He ornamented the court of this mosque with a superb colonade the idea of which was fur∣nished by the church of St Peter at Rome which he executed in miniature He employed in this work the rich columns that had formed the peris∣tyle of the ancient palace of the kings of Pergamus which had escaped the ravages of time but were taken down and removed to Constantinople Sul∣tan  Mahmoud  died before this building was finished  Osman  his brother and successor consulted the pro∣fessors  of the law to know if he might compleat it and give it his name The Mufti delivered his Fetfa or opinion in which he declared that this building not being finished or dedicated to religious worship could only be looked on as an edifice the property of which incontestibly vested in his brother by right of inheritance and by consequence he might take possession of and complete the unfinished building consecrate it by the prayers of the faithful and give it his own name In virtue of this decree the mosque though built by Sultan  Mahmoud  was called the Splendor of  Osman  by which name the mosques erected by different emperors are usually distinguished  The Mufti is the sovereign Pontiff he is at once the expositor of the law of  Mahomet  he has therefore a twofold sovereign authority in all cases religious and civil His election depends entirely on the Grand Signor who commonly ap∣points to this high office men who are eminent for their integrity and learning  When the Mufti is elected which must be from the order of Moulahs he is ordered by the Grand Signor to repair to the palace where he invests him in his dignity and office with his own hands by cloathing him with a pellice of ermine lined with  white cloth giving him at the same time a hand∣kerchief embroidered with silver containing a thou∣sand Turkish piastres in gold He then pays a visit to the Grand Visier who receives him at the foot of the stairs and conducts him to the great hall of the Divan where he gives him the seat of honor and puts another pellice upon him of ermine lined with green cloth when he departs the Visir attends him to the door and orders him to be waited on by several of his officers loaded with the rich pre∣sents which he is obliged to make him upon his election  The Mufti is held in as much reverence by the Turks as the Pope is at Rome He is not denied the privilege of marriage though he is expected to make his residence at Constantinople His authority is so great that when he passes a definitive sentence the Grand Signor himself never contradicts it The difficulties which are proposed to him and his sol∣lutions whether as to cases of conscience or any other matters are committed to writing His reply is generally very concise consisting only of a simple affirmative or negative to which are added these words "God is the best judge" by which he shews he does not pretend to infallibility The Grand Signor has a power of displacing him but  yet he never ventures to engage in any affairs of importance without his consent previously obtained  Next to the sublime office of Mufti is that of the  Caddilaschirs  or Judges of which there are two one for Romania and the other for Natolia Their jurisdiction extends to military causes as their title sets forth for  Caddi  means judge and  laschir  signifies militia This office makes a person eligible for that of Mufti  To the  Caddilaschirs  succeed the Moulahs This body of people who are the expounders of the law and religion in Turkey furnish many examples in former times that when unanimous they are entire masters of the people and can influence them so as to dethrone the most skilful and vigilant monarch that ever reigned They are very numerous and are treated with particular distinction by the Sultan  The superintendants or superiors of the Mosques are chosen by the Grand Visir these are called  Imans  Upon a vacancy the inhabitants within the district of the Mosque present another to the Visir who generally accepts their recommendation and of his own authority without any previous cere∣mony invests him Iman of the Mosque to which he has been recommended The Mufti has no ju∣risdiction over them but in civil and criminal  cases they are subject to the jurisdiction of the common magistrate  The Emirs may likewise be ranked in the class of ecclesiastics they are distinguished from the rest of the Turks by a green turban the favourite colour of the prophet  They are eligible to any office in the state and may aspire to the most honourable The privileges they have are very great and among others that of having any person's hand cut off who affronts or strikes them The Turks however have found the means of evading this barbarous law for when they meet any Emirs in the street who are drunk and have any altercation with them which frequently happens they take off their green turbans with the utmost respect and then give them a good drub∣bing the only mark of an Emir being his green turban when it is taken off they pretend not to know them and this stratagem secures them from punishment  An eternity of rewards and punishments is one of the fundamental maxims of their religion Yet there are sects among the Mahometans who do not believe in it For example the  Giahamites  say this eternity is metaphorical as when we wish the reign of a prince  may endure for ever and the  Giahedites  believe that the damned in course of time will be changed into fire like all other matters consumed by that element Among the followers of  Ali  there is a sect which takes its name from a doctor called  Alk∣hathab  who teaches that the delights of paradise and the pains of hell are nothing more than the pleasures and afflictions of the present life  It must not be imagined that the happiness promised by  Mahomet  is confined to the pleasures of sense alone for though the prophet says that true believers will find in his paradise gardens on the borders of rivers where they will live to all eternity with women whose youth and beauty will ever remain yet he adds that besides these delights they will enjoy the sight of God which will make them perfectly happy His hell contains very uncommon objects nothing but the heads of devils An angel likewise presides here on the part of God and this hell according to the alcoran has seven doors The greatest how∣ever of all their misfortunes in this place will be their separation from God  Predestination is one of the frightful doctrines taught by the alcoran viewed however under certain aspects it has its advantages It is to this doctrine that the Porte is indebted for the facility with  which such numerous armies are raised It likewise tends to calm the useless affliction of a father on the death of his children or of a person who has lost all his property by some reverse of fortune or his honour through the injustice of his equals The populace who carry every thing to extremes acts in the same manner with regard to predestination Du∣ring the plague they will purchase the cloaths of a person who is just dead of this disorder which they will instantly put on their back and say that they can only die of that death which is decreed them by fate This doctrine of predestination is very ancient in Eastern countries We read in  Homer  says  Bicari  that the affairs of this world are conducted by a kind of fatality to which Jupiter himself is obliged to sub∣mit equally with the lowest of mankind  The resurrection of the dead is likewise implicitly believed by the Turks One of the signs which are to precede it say they is that all the animal cre∣ation will die that the mountains will fly in the air like birds and that the heavens will melt and run upon the earth  Their ablutions and circumcision are likewise drawn from the ancient customs of the East It would be ridiculous to insist that circumcision was not abso∣lutely necessary in the East when it is known that  there are many people in Asia who would otherwise be useless to society And with respect to their ab∣lutions the Assyrians according to Strabo made use of them at all times after performing the duties of marriage The eating of pork was forbidden either because it was unwholesome in the country where Mahomet introduced his religion or else to make his court to the Jews who were dispersed in all those parts where his doctrine was preached  The Mahometans believe both in the new and old testament They often cite the new testament and will sometimes cite what is not to be found in it say∣ing that the Christians have altered the text because they have retrenched every thing relating to  Mahomet  And the Jews they add have done the same by the old testament  The Turks bear no enmity to each other and whenever any disputes arise amongst them they al∣ways endeavour to be reconciled before Friday the day of their Sabbath being obligated before they begin their prayers to declare in the presence of God that they freely forgive their enemies or else they believe their prayers will not be acceptable  If persons dispute or come to blows in Turkey notwithstanding all the entreaties that are made use  of to prevent them any one is at liberty to separate them by calling out  charoe ulla  that is "by the Law of God" they are then carried before the Cadi or Judge who punishes them for their obstinacy For this purpose the offender is laid on his back and re∣ceives two or three hundred strokes on the soles of his feet besides having a fine of two or three thou∣sand aspers levied upon him for suffering himself to be so far carried away by his passions  The severity of this law has not only restrained the Turks within the bounds of their duty but has likewise accustomed them to refrain from swearing and profaning the sacred name of God a practice too common among other nations who pretend to be more civilized than the Mahometans The greatest oath they use to attest the truth of any thing is  valla hebilla  which means "by the God whom I adore"  The Turks like the Christians have their con∣vents and religious orders The origin of these in∣stitutions both with respect to the time and cause of them is like those of the Roman Catholics entirely fabulous The two principal orders are the Der∣vises and the Santons I had the curiosity says Lady  M  to visit one of the monasteries of the Der∣vises and to observe their devotions which are as  whimsical as any at Rome Their fellows are confined to an odd habit which is only a piece of coarse white cloth wrapped about them with their legs and arms naked Their order has few other rules except that of performing their fantastic rites every Tuesday and Friday which is done in this manner They meet together in a large hall where they all stand with their eyes fixed to the ground and their arms across while the Iman or preacher reads part of the alcoran from a pulpit placed in the midst and when he has done eight or ten of them make a melancholy concert with their pipes which are no unmusical instruments Then he reads again and makes a short exposition on what he has read after which they sing and play till their superior the only one of them dressed in green rises and begins a sort of solemn dance They all stand about him in a regular figure and while some play the others tie their robe which is very wide fast round their waist and begin to turn round with an amazing swiftness and yet with regard to the music moving slower or faster as the tune is played This lasts above an hour without any of them shewing the least appear∣ance of giddiness which is not to be wondered at when it is to be considered they are all used to it from their infancy most of them being devoted to this way of life from their birth These turning round amongst them some little Dervises of six or  seven years old says  Lady M  who seemed no more disordered by that exercise than the others At the end of the ceremony they shout out "There is no other God but God and  Mahomet  is his prophet" After which they kiss the superior's hand and retire The whole is performed with the most solemn gravity Nothing can be more austere than the form of these people they never raise their eyes and seem de∣voted to contemplation And as ridiculous as this is in description there is something very affecting in the air of submission and mortification they assume By a rule of their institution a Dervise must not eat more than eight ounces a day  Those Dervises who are sufficiently impudent to take advantage of the general ignorance of the Turks set up for prophets and prophecy with impunity If it happen that the event justifies their predictions they are looked upon as saints and held in great esteem nay those who for want of success can pass only for fools find admission every where Nothing can resist their effrontery the name of God profaned by these rascals says Baron  Tott  always imposes on the superstitious multitude and I have seen one of them come and seat himself insolently by the Grand Visir whilst I have been privately discoursing with him and people of great consequence kept at a dis∣tance The fanaticism of the public obliges the most  enlightened persons to submit and the most eminent Turks have no other means to get rid of this rabble than by giving them money which serves only to make them more troublesome and insolent  Their principal convent is at Cogni in Natolia without the walls of the city its circuit is about a mile and an half and it contains five hundred cham∣bers for as many Dervises but the greatest part are generally from home When I visited them says  Habesci  I found but ninety in the convent the rest being dispersed throughout the empire either in other convents or living privately with women for though they are allowed to marry their wives are not permitted to live with them in the convent They are called poor Dervises but with little reason for they take care to provide themselves with all the conveniences of life yet to keep up appearances their cloathing is coarse and simple consisting of a shirt made of ordinary linen a robe or tunic of a dark coloured flannel and a surtout of white woollen cloth their stomach and their legs are naked upon their heads they wear a round cap of camel's hair and they have a leather girdle round their waist They generally have a chaplet in their hands and keep constantly turning over their beads repeating at the same time the name of God Be∣sides the observance of the Ramazan in common  with the rest of the Turks they fast every Tuesday Thursday and Friday The rapidity with which they turn themselves in their devotions says  Habesci  is so great that it is impossible to distinguish their coun∣tenances or their forms and they do it with so much dexterity that it is the most astonishing spec∣tacle in nature Some of them fall into extacies in imitation of their founder who when he was ex∣hausted with his whirling round fell into swoons and then had his visions from the prophet to found the institutions They eat great quantities of opium and are so stupified by this drug as to be almost de∣prived of reason and all corporeal sensation Some of them are thrown into the same state by wine and other fermented liquors of which they consume more at present than the rest of the Turks  The religious tenets of the Santons are very dif∣ferent from those of the Dervises They hold it as a maxim that if God permits them to live through the day it is that they may make the best of it which they contend is by gratifying their passions They constantly repeat these words "Today is for us and to morrow for him that shall then be alive" There is neither austerity nor hypocrisy in this or∣der of men for they preach publicly that paradise may be as easily gained by making use of the good things of this world as by abstinence and severity of  manners For this reason they think only of eating and drinking and spending their time in all manner of amusements They look upon the tavern as sacred as the mosque and hold the homage paid there to Bacchus as pleasing to the Divine Being as that of∣fered to him in our places of worship  There is another sect of religious in Turkey who make charity the basis of their institution this they extend even to animals and one of their prin∣cipal concerns is to feed and take care of the dogs that are employed in the streets they will frequently likewise purchase pigeons and other fowls for the pleasure of letting them fly There is another or∣der who do not profess abstinence of any kind but whose sole employment is to sing the praises of God in Arabic verses The novices of this order undergo a very rigid noviciate they are shut up alone in a chamber forty days and have no other nourishment than twentyfour drachms of dry bread every day It is only by supporting this trial with fortitude and chearfulness that a candidate can obtain admission to the fraternity  The greatest part of the Janissaries profess the doctrine of another sect which discharges its follow∣ers from every obligation to attend prayers the founder having maintained that they were not neces∣sary  to obtain eternal life this order of course is very pleasing to military people who are in general not much disposed for practical devotion But unfor∣tunately he is accused of having propagated the lawfulness of that most unnatural vice which is but too much practised by the Turks of the present age  According to  Peysonnel  all the Turkish monks are divided into two orders the  Mevlevis  and the  Bek∣tachis  The  Mevlevis  are cloistered and live toge∣ther in convents though they have liberty to go out during their hours of recreation Those who turn round and howl belong to the order of the  Mevlevis  though they have different rules just as the Capu∣chins Recollets and Cordeliers are all of the or∣der of St Francis though they differ from each other in their regulations and habits The  Bekta∣chis  have no convents or fixed habitations but wan∣der about They often attach themselves to the great I have known several Pachas adds the above author who have taken them with them when they travelled and kept them constantly in their houses as the Italian Nobles do their confessors Some of them are exceedingly acute active subtle and pos∣sessed of considerable wit and information Many of these Dervises  Baktachis  usually follow the army when it takes the field and no  Orta  or regiment  of Janissaries makes the least motion to change their garrison open a campaign or perform any cere∣mony without one of these Dervises preceding their march On such occasions they generally have the feet legs and a part of the body naked they throw crossways over their shoulders the skin of a tyger lion or some other wild beast and carry in their hand a pike halberd or battleax and as they march sing verses in praise of the  Orta  and offer up prayers for the glory of their holy religion  and the prosperity  of the Turkish Empire  The Mahometan religion says  Habesci  is divided into a greater number of sects than any other The common opinion is they amount to seventytwo but there is reason to believe they greatly exceed that number  To be convinced of this it is necessary to pay particular attention to the conversation of different Turks on the subject of their religion we shall thereby discover that almost every individual has a system of his own different from his neighbour so that it is impossible to speak with precision of all the Mahometan sects The two principal ones from which all the rest have sprung as we have before ob∣served are those of  Omar  and  Ali  the Ottoman Turks are disciples of  Omar  and the Persians of the  latter The hatred that subsists between these two sects is incredible Of their implacability and the essential difference▪ in their religious tenets it may therefore be expedient to render a more particular account  The origin of their reciprocal hatred is very ancient being derived from the Persian legislator himself and arose in the following manner says  Ha∣besci Mahomet  in his last moments having declared  Ali  his successor the three other competitors upon the death of the prophet took advantage of  Ali  's absence▪ who was then propagating the Mahometan faith on the confines of Persia and entered into an alliance to exclude him from the high station to which the prophet had appointed him and by force of arms they set up  Abubeker  as the true heir and successor to  Mahomet  Ali  finding that the last will and orders of the prophet were rendered null and his hopes disap∣pointed by this measure acted nevertheless with great moderation towards his antagonists As  Abubeker  was very old he satisfied himself for the present with the power he had acquired at the head of his army on the borders of Persia not doubting but that after the death of  Abubeker  the dying orders of  Mahomet  would be obeyed and he should be elected  supreme chief of the Mussulmen but he was a se∣cond time deceived for upon the death of  Abubeker Omar  was elected his successor and was no sooner invested with the sovereign authority than he sought for every opportunity by force of arms to oppress and reduce the adherents of  Ali  who remained on the frontiers of Persia highly exasperated but un∣able with his inferior force to oppose the progress of his rival Thus circumstanced he had recourse to religious policy for by explaining the precepts of the alcoran in a manner totally opposite to the opinions and practice of  Omar  's party and boldly maintaining his to be the true faith of  Mohomet  he branded  Omar  with the opprobrious title of heretic and gained a great number of converts who de∣serted the standard of his rival and fled to him for protection The charge of heresy was retorted by  Omar  and his followers and both parties condemned each other to the flames of hell After the death of  Omar  such a formidable force appeared under the command of  Ali  that he was peaceably raised to the throne but instead of endeavouring to unite both parties in one common interest he used his utmost efforts to crush the doctrines of his predecessor which had an effect contrary to what was expected for the animosity and vengeance of his opponents took such deep root from this illtimed persecution that it could never be eradicated and when it was  found that the doctrines of  Ali  owing to his superior influence prevailed in both the Arabias in Persia and in other adjacent countries the disciples of  Omar  grew more zealous in support of the opinions of their deceased master and took care to transmit from father to son that mortal hatred which to this hour animates both persuasions  The first great article of difference in their rituals respects the chief of their religion The Ottomans believe that the Mufti of Constantinople is the only supreme infallible head of the church the Persians believe the same of the Mufti of Persia This dif∣ference gave rise to numberless persecutions and a swarm of different sects springing from the same source The Persians reject with horror three of the greatest doctors of the Mahometan laws  Abube∣ker Osman  and  Omar  The virulence of these two sects is so great that both parties have condemned each other to the flames of hell The Persians to enrage the Ottomans as much as possible despise the green colour which was the favourite one of the prophet and even put it to the meanest uses making their socks and slippers of it that they may tread the colour under their feet They eat all kinds of meat and drink wine without any scruple but the chief accusation of the Turks  is that the law of  Ali  permits one woman to marry several men The Persians are likewise commanded by their law to lay waste and ruin the countries belonging to the Turks to strip their women quite naked and to carry them off to be made slaves From these principles the Turks conclude that it is impossible a Persian should ever become a good and faithful servant or ever be converted to the true faith This persuasion says  Habesci  is so rooted in the minds of the Turks that no Persian is ever suf∣fered to enter the walls of the seraglio in Constan∣tinople though persons professing all other reli∣gions may be admitted there and become good Musselmen  The Turks believe or affect to believe that the souls of the Jews after their death are converted into asses to carry the souls of the Persians into hell In fine they positively maintain that a Turk who kills a single Persian has more merit than in kill∣ing five Christians in battle  A vast number of sects as we observed before have sprung from those of  Osman  and  Ali  which either from their obscurity or their absurd opinions do not merit notice more especially as they are deemed heretical by the Persians as well as the Turks however it ought not to passed over in si∣lence  that some of them acknowledge Christ to be the true Messiah and approach so near the Christian religion that this is the principal cause of their re∣jection by the Mahometan believers  The Turkish government is well apprized that many of its subjects are of the sect of  Ali  and among these there are some who hold considerable civil employments and others who may happen to command their armies besides the inhabitants of al∣most all the frontier towns on the side of Persia not only follow the religion of  Ali  but are prejudiced in favour of the Persian government because the go∣vernors of the Persian provinces are not so tyran∣nical as their own The Turks therefore take every precaution to prevent a rupture with the Per∣sians who if they were not torn to pieces by civil dissertions would constantly seek some plausible pre∣text for commencing a war with the Turks partly from inveterate hatred but more from a desire of ex∣tending their dominions  By a due attention to the life of  Mahomet  and the religion he has established it is very clear that all his precepts may be considered as political maxims on the due observance of which the grandeur and pros∣perity of the Turkish government has ever depended An enquiry then how far the modern Turks have de∣viated  from the original institutes of their founder cannot but be highly interesting as it will lead to an explanation of the causes of the present humiliating situation of a once formidable power whose arms were dreaded in former times by some of the most respectable states of Europe and their alliance courted by others whereas in the present moment they ex∣cite the pity of some Christian princes the contempt of others and the ambition of a third ready to seize every opportunity to aggrandize itself at the expence of its weak but inoffensive neighbour Notwith∣standing the great appearance of devotion among the Turks the principle of whose religion is Deism yet its very opposite Atheism says  Habesci  has gene∣rally prevailed of late years Let this be a lesson for deists in Christian countries It is not in the ex∣ternal observation of the Ramazan in their ablutions or in the pilgrimage to Mecca that we must look for the present state of religion in Constantinople the seat of the Turkish empire It is by conversation with Turks of distinguished rank and fortune either in office under government or living on their revenues that we can alone discover the degeneracy of the pre∣sent Ottoman race Some are Pythagoreans and firmly believing the transmigration of souls would not on any account be the death of an animal Others are professed Cartesians who doubt of every thing  and never maintain any opinion decisively from per∣sons of this pliant description the Mufti is chosen  The Platonic system has likewise a numerous party among the professors of the law and the Imans of the royal mosques they believe in the unity of the Deity and in the love they ought to bear their neighbours which makes them extremely civil and complaisant to strangers As far as the alcoran agrees with these principles they venerate it but in other respects they pay no regard to its numerous absurdities  But as no people entertain such doubts of their religion as the Turks it is not in the least suprising that they have proceeded one step further and em∣braced atheism This fundamental error has pene∣trated the most private recesses of the seraglio and infected all parts of the empire The Bashaws of pro∣vinces in particular converse freely upon the system of nature By the word Nature they mean that in∣ternal principle which disposes and regulates the conduct of all existent beings from this principle they say the sun moon and stars derive their origin and from the same principle man has the faculty to raise himself upright to grow and to bend like the flowers the grass or the trees in the fields  Some years since a printing press was permitted at Constantinople which might have put an end to the national religion of a people so doubtful and wa∣vering in their opinions if a general insurrection fomented by the doctors of the law had not put a stop to it Forty thousand scribes who had gained their living by copying books and writing all that is necessary to be known in that city would not readily submit to a novelty that was to reduce them to indigence  One of the political principles of  Mahomet  's reli∣gion was to propagate it by persuasion and if that did not succeed by force of arms for it was neces∣sary at all events to increase the number of his sub∣jects His successors and all the different sectaries adhered strictly to this principle till of late years Though they affected to tolerate religions of every kind yet they spared no pains to make them embrace Mahometism If a man who had children under fourteen years of age became a Turk from mo∣tives of interest perhaps all the family were ob∣liged to follow his example and if they pre∣tended that they were past that age the Turks would find means to terrify them into a denial of it If a Christian or a Jew had the least amorous in∣tercourse with a Turkish woman upon her bare de∣position alone without any other evidence the un∣fortunate  infidel was either instantly put to death or obliged to turn Mahometan  All those who in a fit of passion said they would turn Mahometans or if such an expression escaped them though it was in a moment of intoxication were afterwards put to death if they retracted their sentiments A criminal of any religion of whatever crime he had been guilty treason ex∣cepted might save his life by turning Mahometan by these means their religion has been so univer∣sally propagated and extended throughout the East and even to this day it is not unusual to see fifty proselytes at a time demanding the turban from the Grand Visir or the Mufti but then it is done with a view of succeeding better in their several arts and trades in Constantinople for most of them in the end either escape to some christian country or to mount Libanon  The following anecdote from Baron  Tott  in de∣lineating the character of an eccentric prime minister it may not be amiss here to insert  Divested says he by the natural strength of his mind of all those prejudices with which the Turks are generally deb  ed this Visir diver  ed himself even on the most shocking subjects It will easily  be imagined that Mahometism itself was not secure from his jests  A European one day appeared at the Porte and signified more by signs than by words that he was a German and desired to turn Turk On being questioned as to his motives for renouncing his religion he informed the visir that he was born at Dantzick and had travelled with all speed from thence to Constantinople purposely to embrace Mahometism This resolution appeared too extra∣ordinary to the visir for him not to attempt to discover the real motive and the candidate being again interrogated devoutly answered that  Mahomet  had appeared to him in a vision to invite him to merit the blessings attendant on Islamism Is not this a strange knave said the visir  Mahomet  has appeared to him at Dantzick To an infidel Though in the course of seventy years during which I have been punctual to my prayers he has never done me the like honour Inform him dragoman I am not to be deceived with impunity that he cer∣tainly has killed his father or mother and that un∣less he will candidly confess what crime he has been guilty of I will hang him up instantly Terrified at this menace the traveller confessed he had been a schoolmaster at Dantzick where he had had the misfortune to occasion some disagreeable suspicions  that the parents of the children with whom he had been instructed had given him a great deal of trouble on this subject and that the magistrates likewise were disposed to shew him no mercy in order therefore to escape their sentence and from being informed that at Constantinople so much noise is not made about so trifling a matter he had come there to change his religion and hoped to be soon sufficiently instructed to contribute to the education of the Turkish youth Let him make his profession of faith said the visir and take the new convert to such a mollach mentioning his name that he may provide for him they were made for each other I have sent him a companion but let them charge the Iman of that quarter to instruct and inform them both that no religion has ever tolerated such practices  Mahometism having been established by force it was a maxim never to surrender a town in which there was a mosque and as soon as one was taken from the enemy the first thing done was to build a mosque in it that the Turks might be the more zea∣lous for its preservation  In order to inspire the soldiers with more than or∣dinary courage they are made to believe that those who die fighting against the infidels are instantly transported into paradise and placed by the side of  their prophet who from heaven has been witness to their heroism And this belief formerly produced feats of valour  We will now beg leave to point out the decline of this great empire which happens sooner or later to all civil societies by a departure from the principles on which they were first established Within the last half century we have seen the Turks yield to the superior intrepidity of the neighbouring christian powers and to the intrigues of the more distant ones carried on by their ambassadors at Constanti∣nople Neither officers nor soldiers believe now they shall go instantly to paradise if they are slain in the field of battle and therefore they fly from before the enemy in the sea service in particular the Turks can scarce ever be made to stand to their guns  By land it is well known they have given up many towns both to the Russians and Germans in which there are mosques While Prince  Repnin  re∣sided at Constantinople the Divan gave orders to deliver him all the Russian slaves even those who had embraced their religion Christians who have pre∣sented themselves to the Grand Visir to receive the turban have likewise been refused for fear of giving umbrage to the ambassador from the country in  which they were born Europeans have even been known to have turned Mahometans for their personal interest and afterwards to have renounced their re∣ligion again for christianity notwithstanding which they have been suffered to remain at Constantinople unmolested All these circumstances seem to denote an approaching revolution in the Turkish system of re∣ligion or a total subversion of this once formidable empire Perhaps the plan for its annihilation is al∣ready laid in more than one European cabinet Russia has just paved the way by seizing an exten∣sive and valuable part of its domains the Crimea and the town and district of Oczakow  CHAP XIII  Army and Navy  THE Ottoman empire was founded by the sword and it was only by force of arms that it ar∣rived to that degree of power which rendered it formidable to the christian world The heroic en∣terprizes of the Turkish troops and the incredible fatigues they underwent in former times are con∣vincing proofs that they were not only by nature and custom rendered robust and hardy but that  they were also endowed with excellent capacities these accomplishments however could not exempt them from those revolutions to which all nations are subject A relaxation from the rigid discipline esta∣blished at their first institution has introduced a ge∣neral corruption so that they are totally degene∣rated and are no longer the terror of the neigh∣bouring countries Every military corps throughout the empire is become the mere spurious issue of what it was in former times  The military forces of this great empire are as in other countries divided into distinct classes They consist of infantry and cavalry To the infantry be∣long the Janissaries the Topeis the Kombaragis the Bostangis the Mekteregis the Serigis and the Le∣vant The cavalry consists of Spahis Zainis Tima∣riots Zebiris Zebganis and Muclagas These forces have not all the same pay The Zainis and the Timariots▪ are paid from such lands as the Grand Signor gives them which are in the nature of the old feudal tenures in christian countries the rest are paid from the Imperial treasury  In treating of each class of the Turkish military we shall follow the division usually made in other countries by ranging it under the following heads land forces artillery and marines  Of all the Ottoman troops the corps of Janis∣saries from its ancient reputation and the very great number of soldiers of which it consists was the most respectable But at present these troops are a re∣proach to the empire no infantry of any nation in Europe says  Habesci  are upon so despicable a footing They are contaminated with every vice and are consequently pusilanimous they are more∣over composed of the lowest dregs of the people Badly cloathed without musket or sabre and sub∣ject to no discipline they are only ready to devour the miserable soup sent them by the sultan for their daily food and to strike terror into the breasts of all Christians Greeks and Armenians whose busi∣ness obliges them to pass through the streets where they are quartered these they insult with impunity because no christian is allowed to make any reply to them So cowardly were these troops in the last war that of who marched from Constanti∣nople for the Crimea not above arrived there  This subversion of discipline is partly attributed to the present mode of enlisting recruits and the indolent lives they are suffered to lead in time of peace Instead of the recruiting parties going into the towns and villages to enlist the most robust and comely youths they will receive any person into the corps of Janissaries Romancatholics Jews and  Heathens are accepted by the officers on the recruit∣ing parties if they have but the appearance of youth and strength without any enquiries into their prin∣ciples The Armenian patriarch who resided at Constantinople during the late war having created a suspicion by some expressions in his sermons that he was a Romancatholic the Armenians complained to the Grand Visir and obtained an order to send him to the gallies but the patriarch being apprized of his danger he immediately sent for a Colonel of the Janissaries to whom he made known his situation and prayed to be enlisted into his company which was accordingly done the same day and he invited the colonel with the rest of the officers of his regi∣ment to dine with him at his house the next day which happened to be Sunday he officiated as usual and upon coming out of the church found one party of Janissaries ready to conduct him to the gallies and another to protect him but the former instantly retired upon hearing from the latter that the prelate was a  Yengicheri  or new Janissary and their officers joined the company at dinner where they were all very merry at the expence of the Grand Visir whose order to arrest the partriarch was the subject of ridicule  The Janissaries are the Ottoman Militia they are divided into chambers or regiments says  Ha∣besci  and each regiment ought to consist of men but at present they do not amount to more than half that number The proper term is  Jengit∣s  eri  compounded of  Jengi  new and  Ischeri  a sol∣dier These troops were formerly the flower of the Turkish forces says  Buschin  and were first formed out of captive christians by the Emperor  Amu∣rath  I They are of a superior rank to all other soldiers and are also more arrogant and factious and it is chiefly by them that the public tranquility is disturbed Forty thousand of them are kept con∣stantly at Constantinople for the cityguard and to assist the officers of justice the rest are dispersed in the different provinces of the empire Every regi∣ment has its separate chamber or barracks and nei∣ther women nor wine nor any thing that can corrupt their morals should enter these chambers under the severest penalties but the degeneracy of the times has destroyed all rigid discipline and their chambers now are the sinks of iniquity  Each chamber has its  OddaBachi  or ColonelCom∣mandant its treasurer its standardbearer and its cook Besides their pay they have a daily allowance from the Sultan of mutton rice and butter They enjoy however very great privileges and an es∣teem for their persons is so thoroughly rooted in the minds of the common people that they are generally  treated with great respect if they do not misbehave themselves very much The Grand Signor himself is always a Janissary and has his name enrolled in one of the chambers from which he receives his pay of seven aspers a day The pay of a Janissary on his first enlisting is one asper a day which rises af∣terwards as far as seven according to merit  Before the Bostangis were raised to the rank of bodyguards as a counterpoise to the power of the Janissaries the latter were more highly esteemed and took more pains to merit it And it is certain if they could submit to better discipline they might still be formidable not only to their enemies but even to their own sovereigns For the Grand Sig∣nor is very sensible that he reigns chiefly by the support of this numerous corps and that they have it in their power not only to dethrone but even to strangle him Many have been the examples in former times to demonstrate the truth of this ob∣servation There is a chief in every province who commands all the Janissaries in that district and who ought to take care that each of them is provided with a serviceable musket and a sabre In time of war they fight without order being totally ignorant of military discipline They should in time of peace by the rules of their institution be daily  exercised in trials of strength and dexterity to inure them to fatigue and accustom them to agility  Baron  Tott  mentions an instance of this astonish∣ing agility which he was eyewitness of in his journey through Moldavia We were passing says he through an agreeable valley with hills on each side where sheep were feeding under the care of their shepherds I was questioning one of the Ja∣nissaries who escorted us concerning the quality of the wool you shall judge for yourself said he on this he spurred his horse through a flock of sheep gallopped through the midst of it selected one of the largest pursued and overtook it stooped seized it by the fleece raized it with one hand and re∣covering his position threw it across the bow of his saddle and rejoined me full speed In vain did I endeavour to make him restore his prize to the owner or pay him the value of it he laughed at my delicacy and at night regaled himself and his companion on his booty  The Agha of the Janissaries at Constantinople has very extensive authority and in the magnifi∣cence of his train and the richness of his apparel nearly equals that of the Grand Signor He resides in a kind of castle situated upon a hill nearly in the centre of the city his guards are very nume∣rous  and there are twentyfour constantly watching in a tower raised above the castle to observe what passes in the city and give immediate notice of any fire If they fail in their duty in this particular their master is involved in disgrace and punishment The rules and orders in cases of fire are very singular for if the Grand Signor arrives at any place where there is a fire before the Grand Visir and the Agha of the Janissaries whose business it is to use their utmost expedition to prevent its spreading the Grand Visir is obliged to pay him a fine of gold ducats and the Agha to the Sultan and to the Visir if he gets there before him For this reason the guard in the tower before they cry fire give notice to the Agha who has always three excellent horses in readiness The Sultan and the Grand Visir have likewise the same number ready saddled and bridled so that it is oftentimes a complete trial of skill in swift riding to answer a very benevolent purpose The late Sul∣tan  Mustapha  frequently won the race because he strolled about the city in the night in disguise  The Agha of the Janissaries at Constantinople is also obliged to be ready at the door of the mosque when the Sultan goes to public prayers to take off his boots on alighting from his horse before he enters the mosque and upon his return must draw them  on and assist him to mount After which he is al∣lowed to ride by the side of his royal master  The enrolled Janissaries according to  Peysonnel  are so numerous that if their number could be ascer∣tained it would amount to several millions for all men get themselves enlisted that can being by this enrollment exempted from certain duties and offices They are however estimated at only forty thousand for which reason they are called  Kirk Bin Koul  or the forty thousand slaves and though there may be four hundred thousand on the pay list which Baron  Tott  asserts it is certain the treasury does not issue pay for more than fifty thousand that being only re∣ceived by the Janissaries of the  Odas  or barracks at Constantinople and those who in the garrisons have followed their  kettles  All those who are not with the standard are called  Yamaks  and receive no emolu∣ment The division of this body of forces accord∣ing to the above author is in  Ortas Buluks  and  Sey∣mens  forming in all one hundred and ninetysix companies The Janissaries are distinguished from the other Turks by their broad caps which being made like the sleeves of a  casaque  hang down behind half a foot long gilt with silver and embroidered and have a cone on the forehead  The arms of the Janissaries are a sabre a bow an arrow and a lance Being drawn before the seraglio  to alter their exercise and receive new instructions from Count  Bonneval  in the use of firearms they threw their muskets disdainfully on the ground and drawing their sabres cried out "these arms have suf∣ficed to conquer this empire and will suffice to main∣tain it"  They are punished for ordinary crimes by the bastinado or blows on the soles of their feet and if they are guilty of any crime deserving of death they are strangled put into a sack and thrown into the sea a cannon being likewise fired for every Ja∣nissary that suffers in this manner These punish∣ments are always inflicted in the night as no Janis∣sary nor any other soldier can be publicly punished The Janissaries call each other brethren and are so attached to one another that they will not suffer the least insult to be offered to any of their corps No person besides their officers is permitted to strike them under pain of death And if they should chance to give any other person a blow he must not resent the affront by striking as no protection what∣ever can save the life of a man who has struck a Ja∣nissary It is from this great respect shewn them that the foreign ministers have always some of them in their houses as guards and foreigners in general are glad to be attended by them in public being secure from any insult whilst accompanied by them  The Turkish cavalry called  Spahis  were formerly the most considerable of the Ottoman forces both with respect to rank valour and discipline but their power and influence at last rose to such a height as became dangerous to the Sultan against whom they frequently entered into conspiracies and sometimes broke out into open rebellion The consequences were the degradation of the whole corps by  Mahomet  IV who gave preference to the Janissaries granting them such privileges that he knew would disgust the principal officers of the  Spahis  This arrangment had the desired effect for the  Spahis  following the example of their leaders abandoned the court and retired to the provinces where they continued to re∣ceive their pay but when called upon in time of war just appeared to answer to the musterrolls and then returned to their respective homes and left the sovereign to face the enemy with other troops From that aera they lost the honour of being considered as a  corpsdereserve  for the bodyguard of the Sultan and their places were supplied by the Janissaries But these likewise having abused the trust reposed in them the  Bostangis  in time were formed into a corps of Mi∣litia regularly disciplined and well armed and to them the honourable employ of being bodyguard to the Sultan in his seraglio and surrounding his pavil∣lion when he is encamped is at present confided  and a formidable guard they are for their numbers when compleat amount to  It is remarkable that when any of the Turkish troops lose their confidence with the Sultan they alike lose the esteem of the people though the greatest part of the Ottoman army consists of troops taken from the general mass of the people Such is the present state of the  Spahis  who are held in such sovereign contempt by their countrymen that they must perform wonders in the field to regain their lost reputation  The  Spahis  properly so called are divided into two classes The ancient who have a yellow ensign and are distinguished by the name of  Cascars  and the modern who humbly call themselves  SpahisOglars  or servants to the others They carry a red ensign and notwithstanding the more modern date of their institution and their modest title they are more re∣spected than the ancient  Spahis  and have prece∣dence on a march in commemoration of their hav∣ing restored the order of battle and gained a victory in the reign of Sultan  Mahomet  III These two clas∣ses in time of war amount to and are paid from the Imperial treasury  There are two other corps of cavalry called  Zainis  and  Timariots  who hold lands under the Grand Sig∣nor  by ancient military tenures and are summoned to appear in arms when a war breaks out but who find means after a personal appearance to leave the camp and return home if they have no inclination to take the field so that they cannot be relied upon in time of danger These compose the major part of the Turkish cavalry and the only distinction between these latter corps and the former is that they serve by feudal tenure and receive their pay from the land they hold  The hope of gaining some portion of land in∣duces great numbers to join the Zainis and serve at their own expence in time of war as volun∣teers If they perform any signal action they are sure to succeed to the lands of the Zainis who are slain in battle If a Zaini or Timariot is old or incapable of service he may resign to his sons If he is killed in battle his income is divided in equal portions among his children but if it amounts to only aspers a year the eldest son is the sole heir and takes his rank But if he dies a na∣tural death at home in time of peace the governor of the province has the disposal of his revenues In Natolia there are many lands privileged because they pass by inheritance from father to son and the possessors of them are not obliged to serve in person but may send a lieutenant with the number  of horsemen required in proportion to their in∣come  The Zehesis who at their first institution con∣sisted of a single corps of men had the inspec∣tion and care of preserving and cleaning the arms At present they have changed their employment and their numbers are considerably augmented They are computed at horsemen and are divided into sixty chambers but they are seldom complete This corps is considered in the same point of view as the cuirassieurs among the other great powers of  Europe  The  Segbans  are another species of cavalry that the bashaws of provinces are obliged to bring to the army in time of war These are a kind of dra∣goons for they fight on foot as well as on horse∣back and form a corps of reserve it being their duty to take care of the baggage  The Molagis are considered by the Turks as military men but in fact they are only servants to the bashaws who having always a numerous re∣tinue keep a great many domestics who cost only their diet and dress the Turks never giving any wages They form a kind of united body in the camp and make a numerous army of men but  though they are young robust and generally well made we do not find they ever signalized themselves by any one act of heroism On the contrary a great part of them are pretended christians and the vilest set of men upon earth These are the men who when a christian church is taken commit every kind of sacrilege break open convents violate the nuns and fighting under Turkish banners exercise most horrid cruelties on the inhabitants of christian countries  Next to the Janissaries the infantry most in repute in the Ottoman service is the corps of  Topchis  or cannoneers and the  Kombaragis  or bombardiers The former of these two corps amounts to men of which are constantly kept at Constan∣tinople and the rest dispersed throughout the pro∣vinces they are divided into regiments in the same manner as the Janissaries Out of so great a num∣ber says  Habesci  there are not above a dozen of them who are good engineers being totally ignorant of theory the only skill they acquire is by practice so that in time of action the service of their artil∣lery is commonly left to chance  The corps of bombardiers ought to amount to of which always remain in the capital But their numbers are never complete for the of∣ficers  wait till the very moment of marching to fill up their regiments This accounts for their want of knowledge It must be confessed however they are very expert in casting cannon and melt their metals with great skill  The Turks have no iron cannon and either know not how or disdain to cast it All their artillery is of brass nor have they any other on board their ships for though we find pieces of iron ordnance in some of their fortified places or on board their merchantships they have all been taken in war or purchased from the Swedes Danes or other Europeans It is indeed very surprizing that their founderies should have no furnaces proper for melt∣ing iron since that at Tophana sends every day to Constantinople a prodigious number of brass pieces some of them of an enormous calibre excellent beautiful and long since brought to perfection ac∣cording to the proportion and models of the Euro∣pean artillery They are continually to be seen ranged along the shore at Tophana frequently in double and triple rows nor can we without great injustice accuse the Turks of total ignorance in the art of casting artillery It is in fact difficult to conceive how they can produce one so beautiful without furnaces proper for casting the small fieldpieces of which they are in want  The cannon however for which the Turks are famous all over Europe are called  perieres  or small cannon their only fault is that they are too short so that on board of ships especially under the wind there is always great risk of their setting the vessel on fire The Turks formerly purchased their gunpowder of the English but a renegado calling him∣self an Englishman taught them the art of manu∣facturing it which they have brought to such per∣fection that English powder is no longer imported into the Ottoman dominions Yet owing to the avarice of the makers in augmenting the quantity of charcoal and sulphur and diminishing that of saltpetre the dearest ingredient they have adulterated it to such a degree that it is no longer equal in strength to the best English powder  Baron  Tott  who was employed to make a reform in the Turkish artillery mentions a bonmot of Sultan  Mustapha  which does not augur much in favour of the knowledge of the Turks in that department of the science of war The Baron had been employed to throw some pontoons over a small river near the capital in order to satisfy the Porte that this kind of bridge which was a novelty in Turkey was sufficient for the transportation of artillery In passing over a dangerous frozen place the Baron notwithstanding his great precaution met with a fall and sprained  his left leg very much The Grand Signor though frequent in his enquiries after the Baron's health was too active to allow him the rest that was necessary The Prince coming afterwards to examine the struc∣ture of these military bridges after keeping me a long while standing says the Baron spoke to me with much concern of the accident I had met with on which one of his officers who had been ordered to attend me in this business thinking to make his court to the Sultan by extolling my activity talked much of the fatigue I made him undergo though in re∣ality he only discovered his own indolence "Do you not know the reason of this great difference be∣tween you" said the Grand Signor "I will explain it When  Tott  came into the world he fell upon his feet and immediately began to run whereas you fell on your breech and there you have remained"  The carriages of their guns are made of oak and are very heavy and coarsely wrought and the iron work is as much too slight and will not hold out any wear All persons whatever except those belonging to the corps of artillery are strictly prohibited to en∣ter the foundry  Baron  Tott  mentions an enormous piece of ord∣nance which will carry a marble ball of eleven hun∣dred pounds weight This piece cast in brass in  the reign of Sultan  Amurath  was composed of two parts joined together by a screw where the charge is contained after the manner of an English pistol  There is likewise in the Turkish army a corps of Infantry called  Mekteregis  whose business it is to plan out the camps in time of war and to fix and dress the pavilions or royal tents for the Sultan and great officers of state Their skill and alertness in the execution of their functions is highly extolled and the institution of this corps is not only econo∣mical but the cause of preserving exceeding good order in the Turkish camps by preventing all dis∣putes about precedence in the situation or splendor in the officers' pavilions  They have also the management of striking the tents packing them up and transporting them from place to place when the army is on a march Their number amounts to  One among many other reasons why the Turkish army is so numerous says  Peysonnel  is that the people in Turkey are divided into two classes the  Askeris  or military and the  Beledis  or peasants Every Mahometan who does not belong to some military corps is obliged to pay a capitation tax and is assessed for his share of the imposts levied on  cities towns and villages and though this law be not vigorously put in execution it causes many per∣sons to enter their names on the lists  The attention of government says Lord  Baltimore  is directed to keep up a variance between the law and the army for unless they unite a revolution in government can never take place War at pre∣sent is not sought after by the Turks especially by great men who are always sure to fall a sacri∣fice for if the Janissaries are successful they grow insolent and if they are defeated they despond in a very great degree either of which occasions the destruction of their leaders The following anecdote will serve to shew something of their disposition After the death of  Mahomet  II the Janissaries began an insurrection and put to death several of the visirs and bashaws plundered the houses of others and committed a great many outrages There lived at that time in the city an old bashaw called  Isaac  who had formerly been visir to Sultan  Amurath  he was a very good natured man but extremely igno∣rant and a very had politician and to put a stop to the sedition it was thought proper to place some person on the throne he therefore went and brought forth young  Corcud Bajazet  's brother who was ab∣sent and caused him to be proclaimed emperor in the room of his father distributing at the same  time great sums of money among them that they might return to their duty A short time after the Janissaries mutinied again and under pretence of excusing their past faults came to the Divan of the Sultan and told him "that all they had done was by no means for the sake of plunder but merely to reestablish the affairs of the empire the laws of which were no longer observed that none but the children of villagers and citizens had military em∣ploys bestowed on them whereas by the decrees of the first Ottoman emperors these posts ought to be filled up only by those who had served in the troops and grown old in the exercises of war all their pre∣tensions they said went no further than to obtain that henceforward the captains colonels generals and governors of provinces should be appointed from their corps" The good old fool  Isaac  says Lord  B  having read their propositions replied on the part of the Grand Signor "that their demands were very reasonable that in future due regard should be paid to them and that they might retire in peace" Having been so easily gratified and dis∣missed they returned again directly and cried out that they would also have chosen from amongst them the  Cadiliskier  who is sovereign judge of the army and ought to be most profoundly versed in the law The Bashaw answered them "My children such an office ought to be held by a person of wisdom who  has studied the law is there any one among you who is capable of it" The Janissaries replied "that there was one of their comrades called  Saroug Bu∣chiuk  who knew how to read pretty well and who did not write amiss that by study and application he might acquit himself very well in this office" which the bashaw having heard said to them "I am satisfied the  Cadiliskier  also shall be yours Re∣main in peace"  Habesci  who was secretary to the grand visir in the reign of the late sultan makes the amount of the military force of the Ottoman empire to be half of which appear to be cavalry and the remain∣der infantry But it being evident that this im∣mense body of forces cannot form one single army we must make the necessary deductions to see what landforces the Grand Signor can bring into the field to face an ambitious enemy who is making daily in∣cursions into his dominions and dismembering the Ottoman empire by piecemeal while the christian princes of Europe seem totally unconcerned not considering that the empress of Russia if she goes on as she has done will assuredly gain that univer∣sal monarchy in Europe to which  Louis  XIV of France aspired and to prevent which the blood of millions was shed and many royal trea∣suries exhausted  Should this Crown of Russia once get possession of Constantinople and make it the seat of govern∣ment for the Russian empire the infatuated English nation will then bitterly repent their bad policy says  Habesci  in having sent their most skilful shipbuilders to Russia assisted by their best naval officers to com∣mand her fleets Already have they had proof of Russian ingratitude in the firm support given by the Empress to the famous armed neutrality  After deducting for guards and garrisons in the different cities and fortresses of this extensive em∣pire it will not be found that very little more than half this immense army can ever take the field at once If the Sultan commands the army in person or even if the grand visir heads it the number of men is considerably increased because they are fol∣lowed by the cavalry usually in the suite of admi∣nistration and by large bodies of artisans from the capital this mixed multitude amounts at least to horsemen but these augment the number without adding to the strength of the army  An ancient custom the origin and rise of which is no longer known has mixed the most insipid buf∣foonery with the art of assembling together the forces of this great empire This ridiculous cere∣mony is called by the Turks  Alay  or the triumph  It consists in a kind of masquerade in which each trade successively presents to the spectators the me∣chanical exercise of its respective art The labourer draws his plough the weaver handles his shuttle the joiner his plane and these different characters seated in cars richly ornamented commence the procession and precede the standard of  Mahomet  when it is brought out of the seraglio to be carried to the army in order to insure victory to the Ottoman troops  This standard is of green silk and preserved in the treasury from whence it is never brought but to be carried to the army Another relick is likewise pre∣served with it in the treasury This is every year dipped into a quantity of water which is afterwards distributed in phials to the grandees of the em∣pire The infidels for such there are even among the true believers pretend this relick is only an old pair of the prophet's breeches but it is certain this holy water is dear enough to those who are favoured with it and those who dispense it know how to em∣ploy the things of this world and the salvation of the world to come to purposes of extortion  This banner which they name  Sandjah Cherif  or the Standard of the Prophet is so revered by the Turks that notwithstanding its reputation has been  so often tarnished it still retains their implicit confi∣dence and is the sacred signal under which they rally Every thing proclaims its sanctity None but the emirs are allowed to touch it they are its guards and it is carried by their chief The mussulmen alone are permitted to look upon it if touched by other hands it would be defiled if seen by other eyes profaned in short it is encompassed by the most barbarous fanaticism  Though the Grand Signor is obliged to be at very great expences for the maintenance of such a nu∣merous army yet he derives very considerable ad∣vantages from it for he is heir to all his officers who die without issue and if they leave daughters only behind them he comes in for twothirds of their effects  Every part of the military establishment of the Ottoman empire at this hour announces its decline but none more so than the weak state of its marine In former times the Turkish fleet was almost innu∣numerable but since the war of Candia against the republic of Venice which lasted twentyone years no formidable fleet has been sent to sea by the Porte The great and repeated losses the Turks sustained du∣ring that war gave birth to a saying familiar in the mouths of the Ottoman subjects that "God made the land for the Turks and the sea for the Christians"  But the total destruction of the marine force of the empire was not accomplished till the last war against the Russians It was reserved for the brave Admiral  Elphinstone  who commanded a Russian squadron in the Archipelago to put a finishing hand to the small remains of power the Turks possessed at sea After having driven their fleet entirely out of the Archipelago he pursued and forced them to take shelter in the bay of Cesmi opposite the isle of Scios there he obliged them to run their ships on shore and notwithstanding the fire of the fort burnt and destroyed the greatest part of their fleet This action has rendered his name so tremendous to the Turks in those parts that I have heard them quiet their chil∣dren says  Habesci  by telling them that  Elphinstone  was coming  It is true after the peace the indefatigable  Hassen Bachi  the present high admiral exerted himself in a signal manner to restore their marine and in three years had forty sail of the line at Constantinople fit for immediate service besides several others in dif∣ferent ports of the empire but for want of ex∣perienced officers many of these have been wrecked in the Black Sea so that at this time they have not half the number of ships requisite to protect the coasts and islands of their extensive empire  The lieutenant to the high admiral generally commands the fleet upon any expedition or when it puts to sea to defend the coasts  The captains of galleys are called Beys they are all very rich of the best families in Turkey and generally are bashaws with two tails to whom are assigned the revenues of certain land for their salaries and the maintenance of their vessels or else the Sul∣tan gives them the government of some maritime place such as Mitylene Rhodes Scios c The Sultan likewise provides the hull of the galley and furnishes a certain sum to arm her the equipment provisions and men must be found by the bey  They have also galliots and other small vessels called  Cungiabai  almost like brigantines calculated for the navigation of the Black Sea because they are light and draw but little water All these smaller vessels are under the direction of the general of the galleys who has for his salary the revenues of some of the most valuable islands in the Archipelago And it is very remarkable the commanders of these inferior classes of their marine have the precedence and are more respected than those who command their firstrate ships and their great fleets if the reason is demanded the mussulmen reply that it is founded on the antiquity of their galleys or some such fable  Three different rates of ships compose the Turkish armaments Those of three decks of course are the first The length of these is sixty ells and the ell of the arsenal of Constantinople contains two geometrical feet and a half Each of these ships carries pieces of brass cannon and in order to render such an unwieldy machine a little manageable the masts and the sails are of an enormous size The crew of these ships amounts to men called Levants besides Greek sailors to manage the rigging The wages of the Levants are piastres for six months and in the wintermonths they are discharged but they serve in expectation of pen∣sions for life if they signalize themselves  The second rates are called  Sultanas  they are thirtyfour ells long carry sixtysix guns Le∣vants and Greek sailors The third rates are called  Caravalles  these measure forty ells are built like frigates and mount from thirtysix to fortyfive pieces of cannon their crew consists of Le∣vants and thirty Greek sailors  The Ottoman ships are almost all built by Greeks from the Archipelago and though they are totally defective in theory having no rules to go by but those of practice yet they are so well built and their beauty and proportion so surprising as not to  be surpassed by any ships of the most polished na∣tions in Europe All that part of their ships under water is built of oak but the upper parts are of fir which renders them lighter and less dangerous to the crews in time of action for fir does not fly off in splinters like oak But the following circum∣stances contribute to render their ships less durable than those of other nations The masts are made of several pieces of wood joined one above another and secured with iron The sails are made with cot∣ton which take the wind better and are more ma∣nageable than linen but they soon tear and wear out The cordage is wretched and will neither last half the time nor bear half the stress of other ropes The quantity of tallow put about the cord∣age to spare the labour of their seamen is incre∣dible and what they consume on the hull of a ship is in proportion of fifty pounds to one used on board the ships of other countries consequently this ar∣ticle alone is an enormous charge in the equipment of their fleets  The marine arsenal of Constantinople is situated upon the port in that part opposite the city where it begins to widen One part of this arsenal is set apart for large ships and the other for small vessels A very large dome was built to secure them while on the stocks from the injuries of the weather but  either from custom or for convenience the large ships are always built in the open air and the dome used only for galleys and galliots All magazines for the service of the fleet are kept within the en∣closure of this arsenal the circumference of which is about three English miles and it is well secured from fire and thieves by a strong stone wall The magazines the number of which is increased very much of late years are covered with lead and are full of all sorts of stores  It is the duty of a capitan  Bachi  to take care to furnish these magazines with all the articles neces∣sary for the construction and equipment of the fleet and to have a plentiful stock in hand If they were not kept always well supplied it would be considered as his fault and he would certainly be deposed and perhaps strangled because wood iron and sails are to be had in the greatest abundance at a small dis∣tance from the capital It is likewise in his depart∣ment to provide sailors in time of war and of these there ought to be no want as the city of Con∣stantinople alone can supply and the Archi∣pelago is full of them Yet during the last war the capitan Bachi was obliged to compel artisans and shopkeepers to serve on board the Turkish fleets owing to the failure on the part of government in not having paid the wages of their sailors on former  occasions this circumstance has contributed to the decline of the maritime strength of the empire  Another method taken by the Porte to supply the want of seamen was to oblige the islands of the Archipelago to furnish a quota of ships and sailors according to ancient custom The succours which government has a right to demand from its de∣pendencies when a war breaks out areFour ships from Algiers completely armed and manned three from Tripoli three from Tunis and from Eygpt twentyfour Cajrines which serve as merchant ships in time of peace but in time of war are fitted out as armed vessels mounting fifty guns each and having men far superior in point of bravery and skill in manoeuvring a ship to any other seamen in the Ottoman service However of all these suc∣cours scarce any arrived during the last war so little was the resentment of an enfeebled empire to be dreaded by its dependent governments  CHAP XIV  Language and Learning  THE common language of the country known by all ranks of people is the Turkish which was originally a mixture of Arabic Persian and Greek The Christians of different countries re∣siding at Constantinople and in the provinces of the Turkish empire have each of them a language peculiar to themselves For instance the Greeks speak both the Greek and Turkish and in the same manner the Armenians converse in their maternal tongue and in that of the Turks The language of the Greeks of the present day has scarcely any resemblance to the ancient Greek tongue it is a wretched jargon and the true Greek of antiquity is so totally lost in Greece that hardly six persons can be found in all the country who know any thing of it To the eternal dishonour of the Greeks it is in the polished Christian kingdoms of Europe alone that learned men are skilled in the ancient languages But what is still worse the mi∣serable  jargon of the modern Greeks has taken such deep root that books of all sorts are printed in it which will effectually prevent the restoration of their ancient tongue The Jews commonly con∣verse in Spanish and the Turks having commercial connexions and daily intercourse with this mixture of inhabitants know a little of the language of each At the Ottoman court another language is spoken which is that of the Persian All commissions and in∣structions to the great officers of state military com∣manders and governors of provinces are written in this pure language which they call  Farsi  The confusion of languages in Constantinople according to Lady  M  must be very great In Pera the suburbs says she they speak Turkish Greek Hebrew Armenian Arabic Persian Russian Sclavonian Wallachian German Dutch French English Italian Hungarian The perpetual hearing of this medley of sounds produces a very extraor∣dinary effect upon the people that are born here for they learn all these languages at the same time and without knowing any of them well enough to write or read them There are very few men women or even children here that have not the same compass of words in five or six of these languages This may seem almost incredible in this country and takes off very much from the merit of our ladies who  set up for such extraordinary geniuses upon the credit of some superficial knowledge of French and Italian  The Turkish language says  Peysonnel  is originally the same with the Tartarian or language of Za∣gathia in which many books have been written By the adoption of the Arabic and Persian it is become one of the finest in the world All copious languages have been formed in the same manner The Arabic which is an ocean derives its origin from the Hebrew in itself confined and barren  The different characters are by no means left entirely to the choice of the writer but are appro∣priated by custom to particular species of compo∣sition The  Neskbi  used in printing is employed in works of science the  Tealik  in poetry the  Divani  in the firmans or edicts of government and epistolary correspondence the  Sulus  for mottos public inscriptions c He who is unable to write all these different characters writes as well as he can but if he intends to publish a book present a memoir to a minister a petition to a great man or a poem to his patron he will take care to have them copied by some professed writer in the cha∣racter assigned by custom to these several uses in the same manner as with us a person unable to  write the law or other hands will hire some one to copy his writings in the customary character  Scarce any thing can be said on the subject of literature which is so much neglected at Constantino∣ple that there is but one library in the whole city worthy of notice and it is of very modern date having been founded by  Ragheb Bacha  who after having been bashaw of several provinces at last became visir in which post he died He was a man of genius and wherever he travelled made it his business to collect valuable books in every lan∣guage and upon most subjects whether written by Mahometans Christians or Jews This rich legacy he bequeathed to the public and together with the library founded a school for the education of Turkish boys A Turkish printing office has likewise been lately established at Constantinople which after great opposition obtained leave to print all kinds of books except those on matters of religion Though the Turks are not men of science to which their great legislator  Mahomet  has forbid them to apply to as tending to puff them up with vain pride yet as men of wit they surpass most nations There are no people any where to be met with who can relate an amusing tale with more grace and elegance They likewise excel every other nation in the mar∣row pith elegance good sense and ingenuity of  their proverbs which adds the above author are always the surest test of the intellectual abilities of any people Like the Italian  improvisatoris  they have their professional speakers who in order to make their court to the great undertake to carry on the conversation and amuse the company on any subject whatever  It must not be thought however that the Turks are so totally deficient in literature as they have been represented by many writers and though they have neglected tactics navigation and military dis∣cipline yet they are in possession of the elements of  Euclid  all the philosophy of  Aristotle  and the entire works of  Plato  whose surname of divine they pre∣serve and whom they stile  Filatoun el Lillabi  They have likewise among them a multitude of Turkish Persian and Arabic books on grammar logic me∣taphysics morality history astronomy astrology and the cabala on geography physic chemistry alchemy and medicine on law theology and con∣troversy with an infinity of poems fables moral tales and romances  The Turks have also their regular colleges called  Medressas  the same as with us They contain as we have observed before scholars of all ages from those who are so young as to have made but little  progress in literature to the  Sohtas  or students ar∣rived at years of maturity These Sohtas are a class of literati who devote themselves to the study of grammar the Arabic language rhetoric philo∣sophy their religious ceremonies and jurispru∣dence Some of them arrive at the first dignities while others remain in the subaltern places of  Imans Mutevellis  or administrators of the revenues of the mosques  Naibs  or first clerks to the Mollahs  According to the strict rule of their public or∣dinances the professors of the law cannot be advanced to places of importance unless they have first been  Sohtas  have gone through a course of study in the  medressas  and have been advanced to the dignity of  Muderris  or principal of the college which is granted by Imperial diploma The monarch can grant them writs by which they are immediately advanced but the usual forms must always be so far complied with that the person then raised must be furnished with diplomas of all the degrees through which he ought to have passed Nevertheless these dispensations have frequently occasioned great murmurs among the  Ulemas  as they often oblige men of merit who deserve a more rapid advance∣ment to remain all their lives in a subaltern station  Bisani  in his remarks on the Turkish literature mentions one of their doctors who had read the alcoran over twenty four thousand times He like∣wise notices an Abbé who published a treatise on the literature of the Turks with extracts of most of the books in the public library at Constantinople without knowing a syllable of the Turkish language The method he took was curious it was to make the dragoman read the titles and different parts of each work to him in Italian while the Abbé wrote down his notes and notwithstanding his ignorance of the Turkish language having had an ingenious dragoman to translate to him the work is said not to have been without merit  We shall conclude this chapter with some few passages from the alcoran and likewise some ex∣tracts from their prosaic as well as poetic writers to give our readers some idea of the morality and poetry of the East  The finest moral in the Alcoran is "Forgive easily do good to all and dispute not with the ignorant"  Sublime and masterly also is this passage in the same book where God stops the deluge"Earth swallow down thy waters sky drink up those thou  hast poured forth The waters were immediately gone the commands of God were executed the ark rested on the mountain and these words were heard WOE TO THE WICKED"  Mahomet  in his journey to heaven says the same book saw an angel who had a thousand thousand heads in each of which were a thousand thousand mouths in each of these mouths a thousand thou∣sand tongues and in each of these tongues a thou∣sand thousand dialects with which he constantly ce∣lebrated the praises of his most glorious and immense Creator  The following are some of their maxims  "When destiny is against you all forethought is useless When the measure is full numbers are no more wanting"  "The success of human affairs depends not on men it is Providence and divine decree decides all things"  "The world is nothing the affairs of the world are nothing do not therefore be anxious after the acquisition of nothing"  "He that afflicts himself for what may happen does wrong for should what we dread happen or not the disquiet we take brings no sort of re∣medy or advantage with it"  "Do you desire the prince to be soft and mode∣rate Exercise among yourselves justice and be obedient to his commands consider that your be∣haviour is the principal cause of the good or bad treatment you will receive A prince may be com∣pared to a lookingglass what you see therein is but a reflection of the object you present to it"  "Four things should never flatter us familiarity of princes the caresses of women the smiles of our enemies nor a warm day in winter for these things are not of long duration"  "The worst of princes is he whom the good fear and the bad hope"  "He that thinks to content his desires by the possession of what he wishes for is like one who puts out fire with straw"  "Wise men use their estates liberally and during their life make their friends partakers of them but the avaricious are so foolish that they amass riches even for their enemies"  "The most excellent of all virtues is purity of intention Justice for an hour is better than devo∣tion for a year"  "The time you employ ill is carried away by the wind of the common vicissitudes of

of death"  The same poet says in another place "Extreme was the pleasure I felt on hearing your footsteps ardent as I was to see the only object of my wishes after a thousand languishing moments of faint hopes"  "By the tears in my eyes and the wound in my heart the clay of which I am made consumes in flames and dissolves in water at the same time"  "At your approach which charms my heart I said

founder of the Mahometan religion  That  Mahomet  was the author of the Mussulman faith is a well known fact He was born at Mecca in Arabia Felix in His father an Arabian Chief dying while he was very young his uncle seized upon his patrimony and made several attempts to have him taken off by poison or assassination which obliged young  Mahomet  to conceal himself under different disguises and pass a miserable life till he had the good fortune to be taken into the service of a rich widow who afterwards married him This event happened in the thirtieth year of his age and he had the dexterity to conceal from his wife an infirmity which had it been known would have prevented his good fortune he was  subject to epileptic fits and when he found them coming on had made it a practice to withdraw him∣self from her company and from society in order as he alledged to pass his time in devotion His wife being accustomed to these retirements before marriage he easily made them subservient to his ambitious views afterwards The first object of his attention was to recover his paternal inheritance and the knowledge he had acquired by frequent converse with the Christians and Jews made him conceive the bold project of becoming a legislator and found∣ing a new religion The spirit of the times was pe∣culiarly favourable to his enterprize The Arabs grown cool and relaxed in the worship of their idols ever degenerated into atheism The Christians were divided into sects persecuting each other with brutal fury for the glory of God and sacrificing to their common animosity the inoffensive Jews who retaliated their cruelties  Thus circumstanced  Mahomet  began his astonish∣ing career His temporary seclusions from his wife and from the world became more frequent and he affected to lead a solitary life assumed an exemplary piety in his discourse and a constant addiction to prayer meditation and contemplation When his wife who became more inquisitive and superstitious surprized him in one of his epileptic fits as soon as  he recovered he solemnly protested that the splendid appearance of the angel Gabriel who came to him by the express command of God to declare his di∣vine will concerning the true religion had entirely overpowered him She either actually deceived or pretending to be so propagated a report that he was a prophet His admirers began to increase upon which he spoke more freely on the subject of his vi∣sions and the revelations made to him by the angel In this imposture  Mahomet  was powerfully assisted by  Sergius  a Greek priest who took great pains to per∣suade his followers of the truth of  Mahomet  's prodi∣gies and being full of novelty they became his disciples  Mahomet  finding his partisans daily in∣creasing boldly threw off the mask and affirmed he had received a commission from God to propagate his new religion by force of arms And that he might establish his temporal authority on a firm basis he made alliances with the chief inhabitants of Me∣dina to which place he had fled from the persecu∣tions of his relations and married the daughters of four of the principal noblemen by whose assistance he took the field with a numerous army of his dis∣ciples collected from the adjacent towns and villages and made himself master of Mecca  The rapid successes of  Mahomet  excited the jea∣lousy of the neighbouring princes who all declared  themselves his enemies The Arabs of Syria were the first to to take arms against him but before he undertook to subdue them dreading the valour of the christians like an able politician he entered into an alliance with them by which he engaged not to mo∣lest them in their civil and religious liberties and they on their part agreed not to give any assistance to the enemies of the mussulmen  By this treaty  Mahomet  secured against any pow∣erful opposition saw himself at full liberty to assume the sovereign power and in the course of twenty years had the satisfaction to see his religion embraced by several nations and his empire aggrandized by the Saracens who owned him for their master and being a powerful people had conquered several pro∣vinces in Asia  Mahomet  's new dominions therefore took the title of the Saracen empire by which it is known in history  At the head of numerous armies this most enter∣prising and successful impostor subdued great part of Africa many provinces in Europe and still more in Asia and died in full possession of every earthly dignity in the year leaving his extensive ter∣ritories to be governed by his successors The title of Caliph which had been bestowed on him when he was invested with the diadem at Mecca in a li∣mited  sense signified no more than high priest but in his person it comprehended the idea of King Priest and Prophet and as none of his successors could support a claim to these three characters an at∣tempt was made to dispose of the temporal dignity to one of his relations he having left no son and the spiritual to another This occasioned a con∣tention which had nearly overthrown the new em∣pire at length  Omar  one of his four generals and favourites whom he called the sword of God was elected by the army to fill the Saracen throne to whom the rest of the competitors submitted After his death a fresh dissention took place concerning the succession which by degrees weakened the em∣pire and laid the foundation of another revolution the establishment of the Turkish upon the ruin of the Saracen empire  The glory of the Saracen empire ended with the reign of  Watik  who subdued great part of Italy pe∣netrating in the year almost to the gates of Rome but he was succeeded by a brother whose cruelty and debauchery rendered him so odious to his subjects that intestine commotions took place which terminated in the revolt of the most distant provinces And in the end the Mahometan reli∣gion had three chiefs at the head of different sects who completed the ruin of the Saracen empire For  the Caliphs of Bagdad in in order to support the ancient government called to their assistance a warlike people from the extremity of Tartary called Turks  The Turks were a people who lived in obscurity without any system of government and were but little known before the middle of the ninth century when they made a formidable appearance at sea from the Caspian ports and ravaged the coasts they then laid waste Armenia Georgia and Mingrelia and defeated the armies of the Persians and the Saracens En∣couraged by these enterprizes they invaded Thrace and the emperors  Constantine  and  Romanus  being unable to make head against them were obliged to bribe them with large quantities of gold to retire from their dominions which they did flushed with conquest and fixed their residence in the Turquestan In proportion as these Turks aggrandized themselves the Saracens degenerated and were at length to∣tally subdued by the Turks who took possession of Persia Babylon Diarbeck and Mesopotamia  In they became so formidabe and extended their conquests so far as to approach the very gates of Constantinople Such frequent and powerful irruptions spread a general terror and obliged the Greek emperors and the Christians inhabiting Pales∣tine  to apply for succour to the European powers but more particularly to the Pope from whose influence with the Christian princes they expected to obtain a military force superior to that of the Turks This application gave rise to the famous expedition to the holy land decreed by the coun∣cil of Clermont the consequence of which was the taking of Jerusalem by the French in Several expeditions universally known by the name of Crusades succeeded the first and lasted near two centuries till the Christians were totally sub∣dued by the Turks  The Emperors of Constantinople in those days were constantly involved in domestic discord Scarce one of them died peaceably in their beds A new mo∣narch was no sooner seated on the throne than he made the most strict search for the relations and friends of his predecessor whom he either mas∣sacred or exercised such cruelties on their persons as rendered them incapable of all the offices of life and these tortures and assassinations were hardly at an end before his own turn came and himself and his friends submitted to the same fate from his suc∣cessor An empire so turbulent could not fail of being torn to pieces by civil faction and rendered so weak as to promise an easy conquest to any hero  in the Turkish dominions which were now extended to the neighbourhood of Constantinople  Ottoman  was the chief whose genius disposed him to watch every motion of the Greeks and when their civil discords had produced a state of anarchy he laid siege to Constantinople and took it by as∣sault After this revolution he extended his domi∣nions by conquest and thus became the founder of the Turkish empire which at one time was equally the terror and admiration of all Europe as much as it is now an object of pity and contempt In the year he took upon himself the title of Empe∣ror of the Othmans or Ottomans calling the people after his own name It is from this prince that the present Grand Signor deduces his pedigree  His residence he fixed at Yengescheri and ex∣clusive of many other towns in took Prusa in Bithynia now called Brusa which his son and suc∣cessor  Orchan  made the seat of his empire  Othman  was succeeded by a race of the most war∣like princes mentioned in history About the year they passed the Hellespont and took Adria∣nople which  Amurath  made the feat of his empire It was this prince who instituted the corps of cavalry called  Spahis  and divided among them the territories  he had conquered He was the first mussulman who submitted to the operation of circumcision which was performed upon him in public with great so∣lemnity To this emperor also the grand visirs are indebted for the origin of their dignity and un∣limited power His son and successor  Bajazet  was very successful both in Europe and Asia He was a prince of the boldest and most sanguinary dispo∣sition of his time To revenge the death of his fa∣ther he marched against the Bulgarians and with his own hands slew  Eleazer  their prince and gave the lands in Bulgaria to his cavalry His conquests were afterwards so rapid and extensive that it seemed as if no obstructions could set bounds to them and historians relate that such were his own sentiments on that subject But he was mistaken for  Timur  or  Tamerlane  emperor of the Tartars marched against him and gave him battle on the same spot where  Pompey  had formerly defeated  Mithridates Tamerlane  with an inferior army totally defeated the Turks and  Bajazet  attempting to save himself by flight was overtaken by the Tartarian cavalry who conducted him to the tent of  Tamerlane  where his haughty deportment and insolent language fixed his future singular fate For being asked by his con∣queror how he would have disposed of  him  if the fortune of war had reversed their fate answered with scorn and bitterness I would have put you in an  THE TRIUMPH OF TAMERLANE  iron cage and carried you in triumph to make you the object of public derision With equal justice then said his conqueror may I pass this sentence upon you and accordingly this cruel oppressor of nations was enclosed in an iron cage and allowed only sufficient food of the coarsest kind to keep him alive Tradition likewise informs us that  Ta∣merlane  mounted his horse from the top of his cage and obliged the wife of  Bajazet  to wait on him at table naked The wretched captive despairing at length of all hopes of liberty in a fit of rage struck his head with such violence against the bars of his cage that he put an end to his miserable existence in  The successors of  Tamerlane  by declaring war one against another left the Turks more powerful than ever and though their career was checked by the valour of the Venetians and Hungarians they gra∣dually reduced the dominion of the Greek empe∣rors and after a long siege  Mahomet  the Second took Constantinople in the year the Greeks losing all courage and discipline after the death of  Constantine  their emperor who was slain in the assault  Mahomet  then caused the head of the Greek emperor to be cut off and carried it round the city stuck upon a spear to insult the wretched inhabitants Three days after the city was taken he made a tri∣umphal  entry into Constantinople when he ordered proclamation to be made that he should in future make it the place of his residence and the capital of the Turkish Empire Thus after an existence of ten centuries from its first commencement under  Constantine  the Great ended the Greek empire an event which had been long foreseen and was owing to many causes the principal one being the total de∣generacy of the Greek emperors their courts and families the dislike their subjects had to the popes and the Western church one of their patriarchs de∣claring publicly to a Romish legate "that he would rather see a turban than the pope's tiara on the great altar of Constantinople" But as the Turks did not exterminate but only reduced the nations to subjection the remains of the ancient Greeks still exist particularly in Constantinople and the neigh∣bouring islands where though under grievous op∣pressions they profess christianity under their own patriarchs  The Greeks having established a new Imperial throne at Trebizond the conqueror of Constanti∣nople thought his victories incomplete while any part of the Eastern empire remained in the hands of the Christians he therefore meditated the conquest of this place which the dissentions among the European powers enabled him to accomplish The conquests  of this emperor were so very numerous and exten∣sive that he is reported by historians to have sub∣verted two empires conquered twelve kingdoms and taken two hundred cities Shining accomplish∣ments and detestable crimes appear to have been blended in his conduct He had a sovereign con∣tempt for all religions and called the founder of his own "the chief of a banditti" He however cul∣tivated learning and the polite arts was skilled in many languages and master of geography and his∣tory He likewise practised drawing and painting for his amusement and invited  Bellini  the Venetian painter to his court In fine  Mahomet  might have rivalled the most illustrious heroes of antiquity if his debaucheries his licentiousness and his cruelties had not tarnished the lustre of his military glory and fine accomplishments Some of the many well attested instances of his savage barbarity are denied by  Voltaire  and other historians but independent of his putting to death several captive princes in violation of treaties of capitulation his cutting off the whole house of  Notaras  because that nobleman refused to give up one of his daughters to his lust and his ordering seventeen of his pages to be ripped up to discover which of them had eaten a melon that had been stolen from him are sufficient to make his memory detestable  Such has been the origin and progress of the Turkish empire which though it had its commence∣ment many centuries back does not appear to have acquired its present extensive dominion and seat of empire till towards the latter end of the fifteenth centuryAn empire evidently founded in conquest and where though property may perchance be sacred life seems to have been of little value as depending solely on the will of the prince and his ministers  Next to  Mahomet  the second  Solyman  the second better known in history by the title of  Solyman  the magnificent seems to have been the most distinguished of the Ottoman line of Emperors He ascended the throne in It was he who took the cele∣brated island of Rhodes which had been in the hands of the knights of  St John  of  Jerusalem  upwards of two centuries His conquests were so consider∣able in Asia Africa and Europe that his dominions extended from Algiers to the Euphrates and from the boundaries of the Black Sea to those of Greece and Epirus  Historians have discovered a striking resemblance between this prince and the celebrated  Charles  V Both were equally qualified for peace or war and memorable for the great number of journies sieges and battles in which they were personally engaged  Solyman  was undoubtedly the greatest warrior and  Charles  the ablest politician There are likewise some other traits in the two characters totally dissimi∣lar  Charles  was sincere true to his engagements and merciful to his captives his severity to the pro∣testants excepted  Solyman  on the contrary was capricious a violator of treaties and inhumanly cruel After the victory of Mohatz when he made all Hungary tributary to the Ottoman empire fifteen hundred prisoners chiefly consisting of Hungarian nobility were placed in a circle and upon a signal given by the sultan beheaded almost at the same in∣stant upon the field of battle He likewise sacri∣ficed  Ibraham Bassa  one of his best generals and an able statesman to the vengeance of  Roxalana  order∣ing his throat to be cut in his presence and his of∣ficers were often obliged to undertake impracticable enterprizes in which they perished miserably from a dread of being put to an ignominious death if they disobeyed One of his generals to whom he had sent to build a bridge over the  Drave  returned him for answer that it was impossible The emperor firm in his resolution sent him a long linen bandage with the following words written upon it "The em∣peror  Solyman  thy master dispatches to thee the same courier thou has sent to him and orders thee to build the bridge over the  Drave  without paying any regard to the difficulties that may occur in the execu∣tion  of it He gives thee to understand likewise that if the bridge is not finished on his arrival he will have thee strangled with the piece of linen which announces to thee his supreme will  Solyman  was the first Ottoman emperor who made an alliance with the French and it was the origin of a partiality for that nation still subsisting at the Porte  The beginning of the seventeenth century presented a compound of ambition cruelty and lust in the person of  Amurath  the third who began his reign with a barbarous act of Turkish fratricide in causing five of his brothers to be put to death in his presence He took advantage of an insurrection in Persia to send men to conquer that kingdom and whilst this scene was passing in Persia he sent another army into Poland which laid waste great part of that country burning no less than noblemen's seats besides several towns and villages Every expedition made by this tyrant was marked with blood till the very Janissaries disgusted with his cruelties set fire to Constantinople and destroyed above houses and then assembling in a tumultuous man∣ner before the gates of the seraglio demanded the head of the high treasurer The whole city was in the utmost consternation and impatiently expecting  a revolution when  Amurath  who well knew his life and crown depended on his personal courage burst forth from the palace sabre in hand and fell with incredible fury on the leaders of the revolt killing several with his own hand and so intimidating the rest that they fled and soon afterwards submitted to a severe reform in their discipline happy at any rate to obtain a pardon His reliance upon these troops being reestablished he made great prepara∣tions for invading Poland and Moldavia but was di∣verted from this design by the powerful intercession of Queen  Elizabeth  The Christians inhabiting Cro∣atia were not so fortunate for  Amurath  made a dreadful slaughter of these wretched people to the amount of sixtyfive thousand  Having now traced the origin and progress of this great empire till it arose to its present grandeur we shall proceed to give some account of its adminis∣tration and the political maxims by which it appears to be governed  In the succession to the Turkish empire no atten∣tion says  Habesci  is paid to age or birthright the Turks thinking it sufficient if in their elections they keep to the Ottoman family Women however are entirely excluded from the Ottoman throne The government is purely monarchical but if the em∣peror  indulges not the humours of the mutinous Ja∣nissaries he is not only in danger of being deposed but of even being put to death  The first care of an Ottoman prince when he comes to the throne says Baron  Tott  is to let his beard grow to which Sultan  Mustapha  added the dying of it black in order that it might be more ap∣parent on the first day of his appearance when he was to gird on the sabre a ceremony by which he takes possession of the throne and which is equiva∣lent to our coronation The Persian monarch does the same See the plate page vol viii  It is always performed by the Mufti at the mosque of Youb a little village famed for its earthen wares and its dairies and situated near the bottom of the harbour forming a kind of suburb to the city This ceremony takes place immediately on the sultan's coming to the throne All the streets from the se∣raglio to Youb are lined on both sides by Janissaries in the habits and bonets of ceremony but without arms and with their hands crossed before them  The ministers great officers professors of the law and in general all those persons who by their situation are connected with government precede the Grand Signor in this procession which begins as processions do in other countries by the person∣ages  who are of the least consequence and who file off without order They are all on horseback and are each of them encircled by a number of valets on foot according to the rank and fortune of their masters  The professors of the law are remarkable by the largeness of their turbans and the simplicity of their horses trappings but the Agha of the Janissaries accompanied by his attendants makes the most splen∣did appearance of any of the great officers Besides the number of valets who surround his horse he is preceded by two rows of  Tchorbadgi  or Colonels who on the right and left march on foot before their general These officers precede him in yel∣low boots each one with a white staff in his hand and a helmet on his head embroidered with gold and ornamented with a grand plume of feathers after the Roman manner forming a long lane of such crests at the bottom of which appears the Janissary Agha who overtops all his numerous at∣tendants But an object really curious is the dress of the  Achetchi Bachi  who walks on foot in the middle of the two rows of colonels and only some few paces before his general An enormous Dalma∣tic of black leather loaded with great knobs of silver covers a kind of waistcoat likewise of leather and no less strangely ornamented This latter is fastened  on by a large girdle with great hooks and a clasp which sustains two enormous knives the handles of which almost entirely hide his face while spoons bowls and other utensils of silver hung by chains of the same metal scarcely leave him the use of his legs He is indeed so loaded that on all public occasions which oblige this officer to wear this extraordinary dress he is propped up by two Janissaries who sup∣port his ornaments  The  TchaoocheBachi  one of the ministers of the Porte whose office principally relates to civil affairs is preceded by the bailiffs of whom he is the chief each of them bearing an ostrich's feather on the side of his turban The  BostangiBachi  is in like manner preceded by two rows of Bostangis with their staves in their hands whose red habits and headdresses present to the eye a very agreeable uniformity These different officers of the empire as they pass along salute on the right and left the Janissaries drawn up on each side who return the compliment by bowing but pay this honour with much more respect to the turbans only of the Grand Signor which are carried in state before the Sultan Two of these headdresses ornamented with feathers were intended at first only for a change instead of that which the Emperor wears if he thought proper but this custom meant  merely for convenience has at length become a sub∣ject of ostentation  These turbans placed on a kind of tripods of a scarlet colour are carried in the right hand by two men on horseback surrounded by a great number of  Tchoadars  and these officers are to incline the tur∣bans though but a little to the right and left while the Janissaries by seven or eight at a time make a profound reverence to salute the Imperial plumes  In this procession not less curious to be seen than difficult to be described the visir and the mufti both clad in white the first in sattin and the second in cloth walk on the side of each other surrounded by their attendants and preceded by led horses and the  Chatirs  or footmen of the Grand Visir On the side of this minister walk the  AlayTchaooches  or LawSerjeants who keep their silver rods hung round with little chains and resembling children's corals in constant motion with the noise of which he is at∣tended quite into his palace A covered chariot rudely made and ill carved but richly gift and containing a little sopha commonly follows the mufti to receive him when he is fatigued  Afterwards come the Captains of the BodyGuards and the principal and under equeries who precede  the led horses of the Grand Signor These horses are covered with very rich trappings which trail on the ground and leave nothing to be seen but the head of that animal the front of which is orna∣mented by a large plume of heron feathers they likewise each carry a horse's tail hung to the throat band of the bridle and a sabre on the saddle with a mace passed through the circingle both covered by a buckler Each horse is led by two men on foot who hold a leathern thong fastened to the head of the animal Two rows of  Assekis  or detachments from the royal gardeners immediately follow after and a troop of  Zulustchis  or BodyGuards with scarlet helmets and lances erect walk richly dressed in two rows and precede the  Peisks  These clad after the Roman manner carry the  fasces  surmounted with a silver hatchet and march before the Solacks a body of lefthanded men who guard the Sultan's person and so called from being obliged to draw their arrows with their left hand these are armed with their bows and arrows and bear rich helmets ornamented with plumes of feather shaped like a fan the extremities of which uniting form two lines of these crests between which the Grand Signor pro∣ceeds alone on horseback The plumes he bears rise above this suberb group and his approach in∣spires a melancholy silence the Janissaries bow pro∣foundly until the line of feathers has entirely hid the  Emperor from their sight while his Highness on his part has the goodness to return the salute by a slight motion of his head to the right and left  An infinite number of Tchoadars surround and follow the Grand Signior They encompass at the same time the  Seliklar  Aga who carries the Im∣perial sabre on his shoulder and is clad in a habit of cloth of gold which is the only Turkish dress that fits the shape  The  Kislar  Aga next appears or chief of the eunuchs followed by  Kasnadar  Aga or keeper of the privypurse who closes the procession and dis∣tributes money to the people running after him in crowds The  Capidgilar Kiayassay  or Captain of the Guards and the  BostangiBachi  who precede the Grand Signior whenever he goes in public are obliged on his return to the seraglio to allight at the first court and go before his Highness When they approach it they increase their pace prostrate themselves at his horses feet and introduce him into the second court walking before him to the place where he allights and is received by the officers of the interior apartment  Most of the Mahometan doctors the expounders of the Turkish law have declared that the sovereign  is above the laws and may revoke his promises and even his oaths when he discovers they are prejudicial to his absolute power and unlimited will Each monarch at his coronation swears he will be the defender of the Mahometan religion of its rights customs and ceremonies and of all the laws of  Ma∣homet  There are however other doctors of the Mahometan law who refuse to acknowledge the power of the sovereign to judge and decide in matters of religion and they are nearly the same ar∣guments which the Romish theologists urge against the Imperial and royal authority  The following anecdote respecting this subject merits our attention In the reign of Sultan  Osman  a mufti in giving judgment upon an affair which be∣longed to religion made use of words similar to those of the pope of Rome to express his divine authority and infallibility But when the sentence was pro∣nounced to that excellent monarch he annulled it "I will not be a schismatic by acknowledging two popes I know there is one at Rome but I will not allow of another at Constantinople"  In the following relation likewise of a fact from Baron  Tott  of but little importance in itself yet sin∣gular and worthy to be remarked we shall see Sul∣tan  Osman  the late sultan notwithstanding this arbi∣trary  power assigned to him by the doctors of the Mahometan law obliged to employ the authority of an officer of very inferior rank with a refractory Janissary who refused obedience to his orders  This Janissary being drunk and pursued by the guard who as we before observed have commonly no other arms but large sticks availed himself of the superiority which his Yatagan a kind of knife very long and bent which serves as a sabre gave over them to defend himself like a lion He had already driven several of his enemies from the field and fa∣tigued by his exertions prepared for a new engage∣ment by resting on the steps of a  Khan  whilst the guard converted the attack into a blockade The Grand Signior who frequently went about the city in disguise but which conceals him from no one hap∣pening to be on the spot approached the offender told him to lay down his weapons and surrender himself prisoner but nothing could move our hero who even dared to look his sovereign carelessly in the face and threaten the first person who should approach him  The Sultan then asked him to what  Orta  he be∣longed and upon his telling him sent for his of∣ficer who presently arrived "Disarm that man" said the Grand Signior "and conduct him to the castle" The officer directly takes off his girdle  This girdle is of copper and weighs fifteen pounds with which the officers may knock down or kill any Janissary The soldiers respect this insignia of rank very much in those who wear it for though of an in∣ferior order they have great authority Advancing therefore towards the rebel with it in his right hand while he held out to him his left he said fellow soldier give me your weapon and follow me which he imme∣diately did with an air of the most humble submission So much more influence will prejudice always have than fear and more power than ever despotism  The same sultan was soon after obliged to pay a tri∣bute to popular custom of which he was himself the victim The art of the physician had invain endea∣voured to reestablish the health of that prince at the same time that the maxims of government concealed his indisposition At length his disorder increasing he was obliged to shut himself up in his palace and reserve his strength to appear every Friday at the mosque This public ceremony which custom has consecrated may not be neglected without exciting great disturbances among the soldiers and the people  The contradiction which appears at first view in a law that requires submission to such a custom from a person so despotic as the sultan will vanish if we consider that it is necessarily dictated by the des∣potism  of the multitude which is the object of per∣petual dread to arbitrary power Secluded from the public eye in the impenetrable apartments of his se∣raglio the sight of him alone can prove his existence It will likewise be perceived that without this pre∣caution a visir possessed of sufficient art to terrify or corrupt two or three persons after the death of his master might conceal it long enough to bring about some revolution in the government  It was not therefore without exciting some very loud murmurs that Sultan  Osman  neglected one Fri∣day to appear in public at the mosque and in order to appease the disturbances that this mission had oc∣casioned he determined to go the Friday following with the usual ceremonies to that of Sancta Sophia which is nearest the seraglio notwithstanding the ex∣treme state of weakness and languor to which his disorder had reduced him This prince on his re∣turn scarce able to keep his seat on his horse though supported by his attendants who surrounded him fainted away between the two gates which divide the courts of the seraglio and died in a few minutes after he was brought into the palace  A book of the laws of  Mahomet  establishes as a maxim of religion that mussulmen not only may but ought to violate and cancel any treaties detri∣mental  to the interest of the empire or of their re∣religion It was in virtue of this maxim that  Ma∣homet▪  obliged to raise the siege of  Mecca  and make peace with its inhabitants came upon them afterwards by surprize and took the city in violation of treaty Being asked by  Abubeker  his disciple and general why he did not keep his word which he had sworn to when he signed the treaty of peace he answered he had acted in that manner to teach his successors by his example that no treaties were to be kept when the promulgation of his holy religion or the exten∣sion of the empire required they should be broke through  Accordingly the Ottoman history abounds with ex∣amples of Turkish perfidy to Christian princes One only of which we will mention as related by his∣torians it being more memorable than the rest  A treaty of peace and friendship in was concluded signed sealed and published between  Achmet  the First and  Rodolphus  the Second Empe∣ror of Germany While the Plenipotentiaries of the Porte and those of the Emperor were still at Pest opposite to Buda consulting together in order to put the last hand to some regulations arising out of the treaty and at the very moment when the Turkish ministers from the Porte were giving a public din∣ner  to those from the Emperor the Turkish garri∣son in Buda imagining that at such a time they should find the walls of Pest defenceless sallied out and attempted to take the town by surprize the vi∣gilance of the German troops however whose of∣ficers suspected some perfidy on the part of the Turks prevented their base design from taking effect and they were repulsed with very considerable loss  The Grand Signior is successor both to the Cali∣fat and the chief of the military government This despotism says  Tott  is founded on the alcoran and the interpretation of that book is exclusively pos∣sessed by the Ulemas Every thing must submit to the law and every thing must submit to the sove∣reign These two powers have the same source and it is easy to perceive the disagreement and conten∣tion which must arise since their right is equal and their interests different  In this passage says  Peysonnel  Baron  Tott  destroys that compleat and dreadful despotism against which he declaims As soon as there exists between the des∣pot and the people an intermediary body whose au∣thority is equal though its interests are different if this body be the depositary the interpreter of the law to which the sovereign is obliged to submit no less than the meanest of his subjects and if this  body and the despot are obliged to fear and respect each other despotism can no longer exist And though it be true as is asserted by the Baron that the monarch may with a single word banish or even put to death the mufti and all those of his body who displease him it is equally true that the pro∣fessors of the law may in an instant by seditious dis∣course or offering  Yaftas  or papers as is practised to the mosques or in other public places raise the people and dethrone or assassinate the sovereign Several muftis who have been banished have been the occasion of greatly alarming the monarch The famous Mufti  Essad  Effendi was in banishment when from his countryhouse on the Bosphorus he excited those riots against Sultan  Mahmoud  which effected the destruction of the Kisler Aga Seuleiman Aga and the Armenian nor would the emperor himself have escaped had he not instantly determined to sa∣crifice those favourites  The first person in rank next to the sultan is the Grand Visir or prime minister his power is un∣limited and his station the highest in the empire The Turks call him  VizirAzemt  which signifies chief of the council or vicar of the empire  The seal upon which is engraved the name of the great seal is in his custody and he always  wears it in a little purse suspended about his neck In consequence of this trust he partakes of the so∣vereign authority for by means of the impression of this seal all the orders he issues and which are dependant only on his will and pleasure are instantly executed  This office was instituted by Sultan  Amurath  II as we have already observed to reward one of his generals who had conquered Adrianople By creating this office he deputed to him the sovereign authority as to the executive part of government and from that time it has been handed down to our day with some alterations which shall be noticed in their proper place  The Grand Visir's court and his suite are very nu∣merous More than a thousand persons attend him when he goes to the Divan he is always a bashaw of three tails The income he draws from the royal treasury is very moderate the salary being only Turkish piastres but from other resources he amasses immense riches Every bashaw on his first appointment to a government is obliged to pay a considerable sum to the Grand Visir and that the government of a rich province may not be ex∣changed for one of less value the bashaws likewise make him annual presents the Grand Visir having  always some political pretext for frequent changes of the governors of provinces When a bashaw of three tails dies his effects are transported to the seraglio and thrown into the private treasury of the Grand Signior but they pass first through the hands of the Grand Visir who generally takes care to appro∣priate a considerable part to himself In short all persons who have any business to transact with the Porte cannot dispense with the established custom of making some valuable present to this officer  It is computed likewise that there are common prostitutes in Constantinople who pay a gold ducat per week for liberty to pursue their in∣famous commerce and this tribute is divided be∣tween the Grand Visir the Bostangi Bashaw and the Agha of the Janissaries All the public houses of Galata Pera and the banks of the canal of the Black Sea pay almost as much as the common women and this impost belongs solely to the Visir Besides these means of adding to his yearly income he has other methods of extorting money so that it is impossible to form an exact calculation of his revenues as they depend so much on the disposition of the person who holds this high office  CHARLES XII of SWEDEN and the GRAND VISIR  DarandaliHaggi Mahmet  Bashaw who was Grand Visir under the late sultan only for about a year and an half amassed within that time six millions of Turkish piastres besides jewels rich stuffs and other valuable effects the consequence of which was that his immense riches were seized by the sultan who never suffers his visir to be guilty of great extortions but that he may confiscate the plunder all at once under the colour of public jus∣tice  The custom of putting the Turks to death because they were too rich is now laid aside so that a Grand Visir who gives up his treasures quietly is only dis∣missed or perhaps banished to some island of the Archipelago  The authority and powers of the Grand Visir are not so extensive as in former reigns the chiefs of the black eunuchs having gained the ascendant owing to the frequent access they have to the sultan who passes much of his time in the harem He is not permitted as formerly to put persons to death without the sultan's orders In former reigns the Grand Visir beheaded the bashaws of provinces and sometimes even the favourites of their monarchs without their knowledge Another loss the Visirs have sustained is the privilege of opening all let∣ters  from the generals of armies and governors of provinces and only imparting so much of their con∣tents as they thought proper by which means they had those officers entirely under their direction but this dangerous custom is now entirely abolished and the sultan obliges them to send all letters upon public affairs to the feraglio where they are examined by the Kisler Agha and the Grand Visir is as ignorant of their contents as the sultans were formerly and only receives implicit orders to answer them in such and such a manner without knowing any thing fur∣ther  The Visir still retains the right of appeal from all other tribunals of justice and for this purpose he comes to the divan twice a week attended by all his own officers and by those belonging to the other tribunals he likewise holds a divan and ad∣ministers justice in his own house In the general divan where he is present no magistrate or judge is allowed to sit down except the chief justices of Romelia and Natolia These two have a power of passing their own sentences in presence of the visir but he can likewise annul them as soon as they are passed  All petitions presented to the Grand Signior must be given to the visir but those complaining of his  administration are presented to the Sultan in his way to or from the mosque the method is says  Ha∣besci  for the petitioner to place his petition upon his head and to raise himself as much as possible above the croud so that the monarch may see him who immediately sends an officer to take the petition and bring it to him  The Spahis and Janissaries cannot be punished by the Grand Visir unless their commanders in chief give their consent a revolt would be the conse∣quence of acting otherwise The Grand Visir has always a  Kiaga  or lieutenant which is a very im∣portant post and must be filled by a person of great capacity and experience who is able to give the best advice to his principal  When the visir gives audience to ambassadors and foreign ministers he is seated upon a corner of the Imperial sopha alone at his right hand stands the  Reis Effendi  or principal secretary of state and on his left the Kiaga the foreign minister is seated opposite the visir upon a stool  Sometimes the Grand Visir gives audience to the foreign ministers at the arsenal or at one of the sultan's country palaces in which cases neither  Kiaga  nor  Reis Effendi  are present and there is less ceremony but more business transacted  Being invested almost with sovereign authority he often heads the army in room of the Sultan and is there idolized by the soldiery Great as this officer may appear in the eyes of his people and exalted as he may be in his own eyes the grand visir met with a rebuff from  Charles  XII of Sweden This mo∣narch having taken part with the Turks against the Russians and being defeated by the Czar at the battle of Pultawa in he fled into Turkey the Turks renewed the war with the Russians and the Poles and coming into the grand visir's camp at the fields of Pruth and entering his tent just at the time the visir had signed the articles of peace between Russia and Turkey and seeing that his interests had had been entirely neglected he reproached the visir in very violent terms for not having drawn more ad∣vantage from the chance of war and taken the Czar prisoner when he had him in his power The visir replied with an imperious air that if all the Chris∣tian monarchs were to be kept prisoners in Turkey and thus kept absent from their states who would there be to govern Alluding to  Stanislaus  King of Poland then a prisoner in Turkey and  Charles  fly∣ing to the Turkish camp for protection The Swedish monarch felt the sting of this remark and looking  on the visir with indignation entangled his spurs in the visir's robes and throwing himself on a sopha rent them to the bottom  When the grand visir makes a campaign all the re∣cords of chancery and the archives dependent upon it are transported with him and make part of his baggage this strange custom is still kept up notwith∣standing the inconvenience they have found from it by the loss of all their writings when they were obliged to raise the siege of Vienna and retreat with the utmost precipitation During the absence of the grand visir with the army a substitute is appointed at Constantinople whose authority however is very in∣considerable for as the public registers are in the visir's camp he cannot decide any important cause without sending to consult him for precedents This substitute is called the  Kaimacan  and his administra∣tion is only provisional for the moment the visir re∣turns it ceases and the persons holding this office are strictly forbidden to mention publicly that they have been  Kaimacans  or to speak of the affairs of their administration If in time of war whilst the grand visir is at a distance the Sultan should be in∣clined to leave Constantinople two  Kaimacans  are ap∣pointed one to attend on his person and the other to remain in the city in which case there are likewise two separate administrations This event happened  when Sultan  Mahomet  IV fixed his residence at Sa∣lonica during the war of Candia  There were formerly six visirs besides the Grand Visir and they were called Visirs of the bench they made a part of the cabinet council and delivered their sentiments freely without being under any dread or controul of the grand visir In the reign of Sul∣tan  Achmet  III his Grand Visir  Ibrahim  Bashaw suppressed them under pretext of economy but in reality that he might not be subject to be opposed by them in the council and the better to silence the pre∣tensions of those who were then in possession of those dignities he gave them lucrative appointments at a distance from the capital which indemnified them for their loss of power but a revival of their office had been frequently in agitation which induces us to no∣tice them  The  Defterdar  is the high treasurer of the empire an office totally distinct from that of treasurer of the seraglio The  Defterdar  collects all the revenues of the empire by his proper officers of whom he has a numerous train and is obliged to supply all the demands of the state as well in time of war as in peace his utmost attention therefore is directed to the improvement of the revenues and the dimi∣nution of the expences of the empire When the  high treasurer is a bold enterprizing man he is ca∣pable of doing much mischief throughout the whole empire and if he be dishonest the consequences are severely felt by the people In the year a defterdar who was a native of Georgia and had risen to that employment from being a slave fled from Constantinople attended only by two domestics and one of his women the treasures he took with him consisted of purses each purse containing Turkish piastres and was never heard of more  The  Reis Effendi  has a double employment being both secretary of state and chancellor of the empire All the affairs of foreign princes pass through his hands His employments are the most lucrative of any in the state except that of the Grand Visir He issues all diplomas for the investiture of lands governments and other public offices throughout the empire No ship of any nation can leave the port of Constantinople without his permission in writing which by the Turkish tariff costs five piastres This revenue alone is very considerable owing to the pro∣digious population of the city and the great trade it carries on with all the nations of Asia Africa and Europe The perquisites of the chancery are like∣wise immense arising from the business he transacts with all the provinces of the empire so that if the  Reis Effendi  is a covetous man he may amass asto∣nishing  treasures even with a fair character but if he be dishonest he has a thousand ways of adding to his lawful emoluments by extortions But notwith∣standing the great influence and authority of his em∣ployments they do not entitle him to a place in the divan nor in the cabinet council unless the business before them concerns his department  The  Nissangi  is commonly understood to be the keeper of the great seal though in fact it is always in possession of the grand visir but the  Nissangi  writes with his own hand the cypher containing the name of the reigning monarch which must be put to every order or grant from the Sultan without which it is null and void The dispatches and public papers of such an extensive empire must be almost numberless and the  Tura  or cypher is taxed according to the importance of the papers those of the least conse∣quence paying seven piastres He attends at the royal divan and his place is on a collateral bench at the right hand of the grand visir  The  Teskeregi  is a kind of vicechancellor an of∣fice of great importance He has all the registers of the chancery and all writings belonging to that of∣fice in his custody and it is his duty to see that all firmans or royal mandates are well written and ac∣cording to rule He is therefore responsible to the  Reis Effendi  for the diligence fidelity and dispatch of his subaltern officers who are very numerous and constantly employed in the offices belonging to the chancery The greatest secrets of state and the most private conferences are imparted to him he is even called upon occasionally to give his opinion on very weighty affairs though he is not obliged to it by his office and his advice is often followed He com∣monly succeeds the  Reis Effendi  when a vacancy hap∣pens either by death or the removal of that officer His income depends in a great measure upon the  Reis Effendi  and is more or less according to the business transacted in the chancery  The governors of the provinces are divided into three classes The  Beglierbeys  the  Bashawbeys  and the  Sangiacks  Their rank is distinguished by the number of horse's tails that are borne before them as marks of honour in the nature of standards or ensigns  The  Beglierbeys  have three the  Bashawbeys  two and the  Sangiacks  one It is a vulgar error to say Bashaw of three tails for that dignity belongs only to the  Beglierbeys  who are princes over princes and far superior to bashaws The horses' tails are as much a mark of honour as any order civil or mili∣tary instituted by any of the other European sove∣reigns  but the account of its origin being little known some modern writers have turned it into ri∣dicule while others have written very ignorantly on this subject I shall therefore first describe the stan∣dard and then give an account of its institution  It consists of a long substantial pole on the sum∣mit of which is fixed a leaden ball doubly gilt to which are fastened a number of horses' tails denoting the rank of the governor and it is adorned with banners which descend a considerable length from the ball and float in the air  It is as ancient as the time of  Abubeker  who hav∣ing lost a battle in Syria was abandoned by his troops who fled on all sides when one of his offi∣cers whose presence of mind was equal to his valour hit upon an expedient to rally the dispersed forces For this purpose he took a long pole and having no∣thing proper to fasten on it as a signal to be seen at a distance he cut off his horse's tail and having fas∣tened it on the top of his pole he kept waving it in the air at the sight of this signal which the Maho∣metans considered as a token of some favourable turn in their affairs they made the best of their way to the standard recovered the shock of their late de∣feat attacked the enemy with great vigour and gained a decisive victory the horse's tail was highly  honoured in consequence of this successful stratagem of war and from that time was respected as the most honourable ensign in the Ottoman armies The Tail was given to every commander of any consider∣able body of troops and soldiers were usually inlisted under this standard in process of time custom con∣verted it into a mark of dignity but in order to dis∣tinguish the different ranks of commanders they varied the number of tails and this difference at present denotes the rank and authority of the gover∣nors of provinces  There are two kinds of  BeglierBeys  Those of the first order are called  CajelBeglierBeys  whose revenues arise from lordships and from all the lands in general within the district of their governments The second are called  SalianiBeglierBeys  whose salaries are paid from the Sultan's treasury under the direction of the defterdar on whom they are greatly dependant  Next to the grand visir the  BeglierBeys  are the most respected personages in the empire and have the greatest authority Their governments are al∣ways either kingdoms or extensive provinces and they have several  BashawBeys  and  Sangiacks  be∣sides a prodigious number of inferior officers subject  to their will and pleasure The wealth of the Beglierbeys is immense  Osman  Beglierbey of Damascus not many years deceased left in his treasury twelve millions of piastres in specie besides a great quantity of rich jewels and he likewise died possessed of very valuable landed property yet Damascus is not reckoned one of the best governments According to the laws of the em∣pire all his effects should have been confiscated and transported to the Imperial treasury but his eldest son who was Bashaw of Sayda in Syria purchased from the Sultan his father's inheritance for purses with this express condition that the Grand Signior should give him a third tail and appoint him to his father's part of Beglierbey of Damascus The contract was ratified because the monarch knew he could not at that time obtain better terms by compulsion but after the peace was firmly esta∣blished by the Russians the Porte prosecuted him with such violence that he was obliged to keep a standing army for his defence in the end however his government was taken from him and his trea∣sures were seized but out of regard to the memory of his father who was highly esteemed at Constan∣tinople an inferior government in Mesopotamia was bestowed on him but this unfortunate man always neglecting to pay the customary tribute to the Grand  Signior and the usual douceurs to the Vizir he was shut up in the fortress of Siras Sebastus and his three tails taken from him after some time he was released and I saw him says  Habesci  at Aleppo very poor and supported by a younger brother who had been a bashaw but had abdicated his govern∣ment and lived retired in that city  Each Beglierbey in time of war is obliged to furnish soldiers for the army in proportion to the stated revenues of his governments and the ratio is one man for every five aspres and an half he is also obliged to furnish them with subsistence  In Asia there are eighteen Beglierbeys or princes of three tails whose salaries are three or four excepted about a million of aspres a year ex∣clusive of Bassora and Bagdat which are now united into one government the salary of which is ducats and for every ducat paid them by the Sultan they must provide a soldier  In Europe there are fourteen of these Beglierbeys their salaries are from five hundred thousand to a million of aspres Each of these principal govern∣ments has its mufti cadi reiseffendi defterdar agha of the Janissaries and  Spathilar Aghasi  The agha of the Janissaries is commander in chief of  that corps and the  Spathilar Aghasi  is commander of the provincial troops in each province  There is also a Beglierbey for Grand Cairo who has a salary of six thousand ducats though Egypt is in fact at present only nominally dependant on the Grand Signior  When they are in march against the enemy or going to encamp the Beglierbeys of Natolia Bag∣dat Grand Cairo and Romelia have the prece∣dence of all others and they give it to each other according to the antiquity of their respective govern∣ments computing from the time they were con∣quered by the Mussulmen  It would be tedious and useless to enter into the particulars of the inferior governments which depend on the principal ones and have their mufti cadi c yet they are all appointed by their governors and not by the Grand Signior as in the chief provinces However some of these dependant governments have sometimes made their principals and even the Grand Signior himself tremble by their insurrections particularly those of Beylan and Pajas in the vicinity of Alexandretta and of Cogni in Natolia  It has always been difficult to give a just idea of the political system or constitution of monarchial go∣vernments the whole depending commonly upon the caprice of the sovereigns or the private interests of those who surround him The history of Turkey abounds with melancholy instances of the most un∣just and bloody wars and of the most astonishing re∣volutions in kingdoms proceeding from the slightest causes Though property as we have before ob∣served is highly respected in Turkey heads says  Habesci  are taken off with as little ceremony as an English gardener would cut off a parcel of cabbages from the stalks and that without any apparent reason This seems to have been the mode of conduct in the old French government No man could have his pro∣perty taken from him but by a regular course of law as in England but his person was liable to be im∣prisoned in their Bastile at the pleasure of the mi∣nister though it does not appear that such orders have ever been wantonly exercised for the last hundred years whatever giddy brained Frenchmen may as∣sert to the contrary and probably in extensive go∣vernments like that of France it may be for the ge∣neral welfare of the community that such discre∣tionary powers should be lodged in the hands of the minister Property seems equally sacred in Turkey A late Sultan says Baron  Tott  had determined to build a mosque its situation was fixed upon and he  seemed likely to meet with no difficulty in making the necessary purchases when a Jew who possessed a house of small value in the centre of this piece of ground refused to part with it at any price Large offers were made in vain the Israelite was inflexible and his avarice gave way to his obstinacy All the courtiers accustomed to see every opposition bow before the prince pleased themselves with the hopes of seeing the Jew's house erased and himself dragged to punishment But happy the princes who confound not the sovereign with the man nor believe it al∣lowable to use their authority to gratify their revenge Such was Sultan  Solyman  he descended from the throne to consult the law and wrote thus to the mufti A man desires to build a temple to the di∣vinity all the mussulmen proprietors of the ground on which it is to be erected are in haste to partici∣pate in so good a work one only and he a Jew refuses all offers What punishment does he deserve None replied the mufti Property is sacred with∣out distinction of individuals and a temple may not be erected to God in violation of so holy a law It is favourable to the desire which the Jew no doubt has to leave to his children a property the value of which they would perhaps soon dissipate but it is the right of the sovereign to insist on hiring any ground for which he has occasion A contract therefore for the hire of the ground must be made  out to the Jew and his descendants and then the house may be pulled down and the mosque built without fear that the prayers of the mussulmen of∣fered up therein should be rejected  Habesci  himself admits that revolutions would happen more frequently than even in former pe∣riods of the Turkish history if a summary justice was not sometimes exercised as well within the walls of the feraglio as in the city of Constantinople and in the provinces  With respect to public economy all the foresight and prudence that can be wished for in the most civilized countries is observed in Turkey A rea∣diness to receive and a great care to guard and pre∣serve the public money is the character of the Turkish ministers of the finances and they have likewise an adroitness peculiar to them of imposing taxes that will not give disgust and an inconceivable alertness in suppressing them the moment any popular discon∣tent appears But to counterbalance this act of pru∣dent policy there is another of cruelty and injustice not practised in any other nation The Sultan is uni∣versal heir to the effects of his deceased subjects and unless he thinks proper will only leave the eldest son sufficient for common subsistence It is true this common law is not always enforced but it is never∣theless  a fundamental right of the sovereigns in Turkey Though this stretch of despotism has the appearance of public economy as the value of the effects is paid into the public treasury yet its prin∣cipal object is the support of the arbitrary power of the monarch for the right is seldom exerted except the deceased person was very rich or held a con∣siderable office under government The Ottoman so∣vereigns know very well that great riches enable men to form powerful parties to make dangerous con∣nections and to attempt revolutions if they happen to be disaffected It is for this reason principally that they seize the effects of rich bashaws after their decease that their sons may not secure themselves by means of their numerous adherents in their fathers governments  There are likewise among the Mahometans as well as among the Christians a set of men who fancy themselves born superior to the rest of the human race by inheriting noble blood and such men in despotic governments are greatly to be dreaded  Another very singular method is taken by the Sultans to reduce the great riches of the bashaws of whose influence in the empire they are become jea∣lous and that is by marrying them to their own daughters sisters or nieces by compulsion for they  dare not refuse the proposal of being so nearly re∣lated to their Sovereign and they are under the ne∣cessity of making very rich presents to the intended bride and after the marriage must maintain them in a manner suitable to their Imperial rank This suc∣cessful method of draining their purses likewise gives a different turn to the ambition of their dangerously great men as instead of being at the head of parties in opposition to the Sultan they warmly espouse the interest of their august relation and are the chief spies on the conduct of other bashaws not in the same circumstances Thus a princess is disposed of with∣out expence and the tranquillity of the state at the same time further secured As a provision likewise against hereditary successions to nobility the chil∣dren of such marriages are excluded by law from rising to any great office under government  Many of these princesses have been married to fourteen or fifteen successive bashaws For as the principal object of the Porte is to destroy that power∣ful influence which exorbitant wealth creates the Sultan obliges a bashaw of seventy or eighty years of age to marry a princess hardly two months old the husband in that case being obliged to be at the ex∣pence of her maintenance and that of her household He dies perhaps after a few months and the princess is transferred by marriage to a second bashaw older  and more infirm than the first and thus she passes from husband to husband so that in the course of twenty years she may easily have been the widow of a dozen husbands whom she has never seen and when she is arrived at an age to be united to a man then they give her a husband to whom she is de∣livered and with whom she resides constantly like other wives These ladies are called Sultanas and during the premature marriages we have mentioned a hotel is provided for them in which they live apart from the Porte but it must be either in Constan∣tinople or its environs  Another political maxim of the Turkish govern∣ment is the frequent change of the principal officers of state For upon the appointment of a new officer or his promotion to a higher post he is obliged to make very considerable presents to the Sultan and the short duration of these ministers in their posts does not permit them to adopt any ideas adverse to that blind obedience and slavery which is the support of despotism Besides these ministers to indemnify themselves for the great disbursements they have made in presents are obliged to oppress and rob the people they govern and this has an admirable ten∣dency to accomplish one principal end in the Turkish system of politics which is to depress the spirits of the people in the provinces by frequent vexations  and extortions that they may be accustomed to bear the yoke of slavery without murmuring It is well known that no bounds can be prescribed to the in∣satiable love of riches if therefore some of the bashaws of provinces and their sangiacks should have gone too great lengths in order to amass money ra∣pidly under the apprehension of being removed they are effectually removed by having their heads taken from their shoulders and the Sultan thus de∣monstrates his love to his subjects and fills his coffers by the seizure of the immense riches of the criminal  The second branch of the Ottoman system of po∣litics respects the interests of the state at home and abroad No people ever possessed the art of dissi∣mulation or to speak in the courtly stile of  Chester∣field  of simulation in a greater degree than the Turks They know how to make an opportune sa∣crifice even of their most darling passions to their political interests It is an absurd idea too gene∣nerally entertained that the Turks are choleric and untractable on the contrary when it suits their pur∣pose either as a nation or as individuals no people are more pliant they will even submit to the grossest in∣sults to gain a favourite point or an important object  They have the addroitness on the subject of public affairs to publish just what they think proper to  amuse the people and to blend truth with falshood so artfully that it is hardly possible to discover the de∣ceit thus deluded at several periods of the Russian war the Turks believed they were in the arms of vic∣tory when they were almost surrounded by the enemy and defeated in every quarter  The Ottoman cabinet spares neither pains not ex∣pence to acquire an intimate knowledge of the views and interests of all the other powers of Europe And having scarce any public ministers at the different courts it is remarkable they obtain earlier and better intelligence from their secret enemies than is received or transmitted home by the whole  corps diplomatique  A memorable proof of this was given at Constantinople upon the death of the late King of France Louis XV The Grand Visir notified this event publicly five days before the courier from France brought the intelligence to the Marquis de St Priest the French ambassador at Constantinople These emissaries are either Greeks or Jews and they find the means of conveying intelligence to the Porte much sooner than any minister The policy of the Turks in this article says  Habesci  is admirable for the dignity of the Sultan is never committed by any act of these emissaries whereas if a declared minister receives an insult his royal master is obliged to re∣sent it or if he commits any gross error at the court  to which he is sent his master must be respon∣sible Such emissaries likewise mix freely with the people and thereby gain information which would never be given to an avowed minister So well served is the Porte by these agents that  Habesci  who was secretary to a late grand visir asserts he has seen upon the visir's table exact lists of the military forces of the principal powers in Europe with calculations of the utmost amount of ships and troops they could possibly assemble for particular purposes details of their reciprocal misunderstand∣ings interesting anecdotes of the internal adminis∣tration of their respective governments and de∣lineations of the ruling characters of their prime ministers  What shall we say then of a court so well informed where the major part are soldiers and where the want of success in their generals is punished with death in fine where measures are so well concerted before a war is commenced when we see its empire hasten∣ing to dissolution but that despotism and avarice on the part of its rulers and cowardice and indo∣lence on the part of the people uniting with super∣stition and voluptuousness are undermining its foun∣dation It is possible however some man of genius may start up and availing himself of the docility and flexibility of his countrymen train and lead  them on to victory to conquest and deliverance from the dreaded yoke of the Russians  Another article of domestic policy in Turkey is to secure a constant supply of the necessaries and conveniences of life on easy terms The Turkish government merits much praise for its strict attention to the articles of provision of which there is always very great abundance at Constantinople notwith∣standing the immense number of its inhabitants ex∣ceeding that of any other capital in Europe The markets are daily supplied not only abundantly but on more moderate terms than in any other city and the variety is so great that the most luxurious appe∣tite may be easily gratified For this purpose the government takes care to keep up a good understand∣ing with all those places from whence provisions or other conveniences of life are brought to Constan∣tinople they will suffer indignities outrages and even seditions without resentment from the Tartars of the Crimea because they furnish the city with vast quantities of provisions forage c It is for the same reason the Turks are so careful to preserve to themselves the navigation of the Black Sea  CHAP XVI  Laws and Revenue  ALL law proceedings in Turkey are reduced to the deposition of witnesses no other proofs are admitted or required and witnesses according to  Habesci  are to be purchased at any rate The judge has it always in his power to declare which are false and which are true witnesses this opens the door to private interest for the best witnesses are ge∣nerally those whose employers can make the richest presents to the judge and when the partiality and oppression of those judges have stirred up the people to carry their complaints to the foot of the throne the Sovereign the above author adds most graciously condescends to open the Imperial treasury to receive the riches they have amassed as fines for the false judgment they have given and to appoint new judges as venal as their predecessors  Fortunately for the dismissed judges they belong to a corps dreaded by the sultans and therefore are  permitted to wear their heads in obscurity the re∣mainder of their lives  It is scarce possible to give credit to the severity of the punishments inflicted in Turkey or the rapidity of executing them The Turkish government hardly makes any distinction of offences for it punishes equally with death those violations of the law how∣ever trifling which happen through negligence or in∣attention as well as the most atrocious crimes In an empire like the Turkish this extreme severity is almost essential to its preservation The frequent changes of the governors of provinces and other great officers of state who are generally promoted to answer the particular views of the Sultan or grand visir without any regard to abilities or merit is the fruitful source of many evils which frequent and sudden executions are supposed in some measure to remedy  With respect to the military the same severity being extended to every rank of officers it is re∣markable that instances of cowardice or misconduct in Turkish generals happen very seldom on the contrary the dread of punishment has made them perform the most heroic actions The rigour of the laws and the certainty of being put to death for violating them affects all orders of men  throughout the empire It obliges them who hold public offices to be attentive and diligent in the dis∣charge of their important duties and produces in the mass of the people that humility and moderation which is not to be met with in the common people of any other country  In fact it is very astonishing that in so large and populous a city as Constantinople inhabited by per∣sons of different nations and religions a murder or a robbery is scarce ever committed it therefore most assuredly owes its public tranquillity and good order to the regulation of its police which we have already noticed  The Grand Visir the Capitan Pacha the Agha of the Janissaries and the Bostangi Bashaw are the only ministers who have the right of inflicting con∣dign punishment each in their respective departments But the grand visir is absolute in this particular over all manner of persons whatever including even the other ministers just mentioned for he is the executor of the supreme will of the Sultan unless he chooses to draw the hand of justice himself a circumstance which frequently occurred in the early part of the Ottoman history but of which there is no instance of late date the Turkish sovereigns having imitated the examples of Christian powers by throwing the  burthen of every act of cruelty and oppression on the head and shoulders of their ministers or political porters The inferior officers of justice may inflict pecuniary punishments imprison and chastise by corporal pains  The modes of execution in Turkey not practised in the Christian nations of Europe are impaling suf∣focations and strangling but of late years behead∣ing with the scimitar is the most prevailing and with respect to great men and upon sudden emer∣gencies after the fatal mandate is issued it is executed in the most speedy manner possible the capigi bachi or the executioner frequently coming with his attendants upon the person he is ordered to dis∣patch by surprize in his house or in his gardens or on the highway and according to the situation in which he finds him to be sometimes laying him across the knees of one while another strikes off his head at a blow at other times when sitting upon his sofa smoaking his pipe or taking his coffee off goes the head of the person whom the capigi bachi was orders to put to death at a moment when such a catastrophe was least expected the warrant having been shewn to his attendants by the executioners in their way to his apartments imposes profound silence and an im∣plicit obedience from the dread of their own per∣sonal safety being endangered if they make any noise  In cases of resistance which proceed only from the unforunate victim himself or perhaps the zeal of some devoted slave a horrid mangling ensues the executioner who has made himself expert in his office by throwing up apples in the air and cutting them in half as they descend aims at the neck as well as he can but missing his mark makes dreadful havock in destroying his victim  These  Capigi Bachis  says Baron  Tott  are a kind of chamberlains who introduce all those persons who have audiences of the Grand Signior into his presence They are likewise to execute all the orders of the Sultan of what nature soever they may be To collect provisions levy troops confirm a pacha in his post drain him of his wealth cut off his head conduct him into exile or poison him on the road make a part of the office of  Capigi Bachis  When the Porte wished formerly to dispatch any powerful bashaws one of these Capigi Bachis were sent to him who came under the mask of friendship but their attempts having frequently miscarried they have been obliged says the above writer to adopt the resource of assassinating or poisoning those officers they have resolved to punish In this case the per∣son employed disguises himself as well as he can and furnished with an order which he carefully con∣ceals  endeavours to get at the person proscribed chooses if possible the opportunity when the divan is sitting of killing his man presents his order and runs no further risk if he has been sufficiently dextrous not to fail in his blow  To render robbers on the highway punishable they must be taken in the commission of some daring crime The legislator of the Arabs says  Tott  thought no doubt he owed this complaisance to a nation which lived only by rapine If any murders are committed in a village the cadi repairs there and lays a fine on the inhabitants without troubling himself to take the offenders On this account the country people are but too apt to conceal the crimes that have been com∣mitted from the judge whose presence is more dan∣gerous to them than that of the thieves who like tradesmen in our cities not having taken up their freedom are punished when found at work but when rich quit their occupation recount the feats they have performed are honoured with respect and arrive at employments in which they have again opportunity to exercise their abilities  It is a shocking truth adds the above author that murders are suffered to be pardoned in Turkey at the intercession of the nearest relations of the party murdered Of this Baron  Tott  gives a very remark∣able  instance A Turk in haste to inherit had mur∣dered his father and was condemned on the strongest proof to lose his head One of his friends the com∣panion of his debaucheries hastened to the judge with a large sum of money where he was informed that the sentence had already been pronounced Not discouraged at this information he continued to press the Cadi whom the sight of such a bribe had al∣ready won over to his interest I cannot said he to his client acquit your friend without a stronger proof of his innocence than the evidence on which he has been convicted Be bold enough to declare yourself the murderer of his father procure two wit∣nesses and I will condemn you to undergo the pu∣nishment to which he has been sentenced he will be immediately reinstated in all his rights and have the power to grant you a pardon The undertaking was hazardous no great confidence could be placed in a parricide however he consented The con∣victed criminal was accordingly released pardoned the pretended murderer and this villainy conducted in due form of law says the Baron was completely successful  Besides the processes which are caused by judicial informations verification of title and appeals to su∣perior tribunals all private quarrels and accusations are in the first instance brought before the judge  without the other party daring to refuse his appear∣ance if the dispute has taken place in presence of a number of people  At the very name of justice the multitude will al∣ways take part against him by whom it has been re∣fused it is sacred among all nations it is the central point of the human mind it may be mis∣taken we may endeavour to elude it or deceive others but we cannot deceive ourselves  He who gains the day always pays the costs the fear of losing what they have cannot therefore re∣press the desire of defrauding others and the pu∣nishments denounced against false witnesses in Turkey to be led through the streets on an ass with the face turned towards the tail are rarely executed accord∣ing to the above author the judges to whose interest they contribute owe them too much respect  A Turk adds the Baron was desirous of dispos∣sessing his neighbour of a field of which he was the legal possessor He began by procuring a sufficient number of witnesses to depose that the field had been sold him by the proprietor he afterwards applied to the judge and remitted him piastres to engage him to authorise his villainy This measure sufficiently proved the subtlety and wickedness of his claims and  excited the indignation of the cadi he dissembled his anger however and gave a hearing to the parties The lawful owner of the field dwelt on the insuffi∣ciency of the other's title You have no witnesses then said the judge No matter he adds I have five hundred for you which depose in your favour He then produced the purse he had received as a bribe and drove away the false claimant  This anecdote says Baron  Tott  though it does honour to the integrity of the judge does none to the law which is always the same namely that if one party denies the other is permitted to prove by witnesses For instance says the Baron if I am sued by a man I have never seen for a debt I never owed I shall be obliged to pay him on the depo∣sition of two Turkish witnesses who shall affirm their knowledge of the debt  Peysonnel  in this part of his strictures on Baron  Tott  's memoirs remarks that instead of reciting the laws the Baron only relates how they are abused Had he taken the trouble to turn over their  Mulleka  which is their written order and contains all the pre∣cepts of their religious worship and the whole of their jurisprudence both civil and criminal if he had consulted  Durer  and  Kalebi  its two principal commentaries if he had examined the collections of  the  Fetfas  or sentences of the most celebrated muftis and especially those of Ali Effendi he would have found a multitude of wise and well digested laws and decisions no less equitable than ingenious He would have published them and with reason declaimed and thundered against those unjust judges who had ren∣dered them of no effect Far be it from me says  Peysonnel  to attack or even support the integrity of Christian magistrates But if any one should weigh in the balance of equity the inconveniences of the two systems of judicature if without speaking of the corruption favour cabals intrigue solicitations and influence of men in power were he only to put into the other scale in opposition to the defects of Mahometan justice the ceaseless litigations which in the courts of Europe last from generation to genera∣tion the hydra of forms the labyrinth of rights and customs the privileges of nobles cities and cor∣porations and the enormous expences of justice which have often amounted to ten times the property in dispute it would be difficult to decide which scale outweighed the other  Instead of giving an abridgment of the ordinances of  Soliman  the Great which extend to every part of the civil feudal and military juridiction as well as to the expenditure of the revenue and which give a determinate and accurate idea of the extent of the  power of the Sultan of the bounds prescribed him by the laws and of that portion delegated by him to the Visirs Agas and the subaltern officers in the provinces he has contented himself with asserting that these visirs and pachas are so many rascals who derive from each other the power of oppressing and arbitrarily plundering the people and that the fruits of these numerous extortions and villainies all flow into the reservoir of the despot which swallows up the entire wealth of the subject He with other writers loudly declaims against the proofs by wit∣nesses by which all causes are decided in the Turkish tribunals he likewise declaims against the number of false witnesses which are but too easily procured for money without considering that the testimony of witnesses is the basis of all criminal proceedings in every country and that false witnesses are unhappily every where but too numerous while the truth or falsity of their assertions can only be discovered by the sagacity of the judge  The Baron has certainly cited several instances not very honourable to Ottoman justice But would it be equitable in order to give an idea of the justice exercised in the higher courts of France to cite as examples the proceedings against sorcerers or the condemnatlon and unjust punishment of Mareschal de  Marillac  of  Calas  or of many others Ought not  a writer on such subjects to distinguish between the nature of the law and its abuses which proceed from ignorance error prevarication or tyranny The Turks have no doubt like other nations their mo∣ments of relaxation and insanity in which the laws lose their force the people their understanding and the government its authority in which there is no counterpoise to the tyranny of the monarch the avidity of those in office or the rapacity of subalterns in which all good institutions are neglected and every thing is plunged in confusion and anarchy But would an author be thought to give a just idea of the French monarchy in selecting the reigns of  Charles  VI VII and that of  Louis  XI or by describing the massacre of St  Bartholomew  or the commotions of the League or the Fronde A nation which in the last century carried its victorious arms to the very walls of Vienna and even in the year triumphed over the united efforts of the Russians and Germans and concluded after a brilliant victory the glorious peace of Belgrade How unjust in modern writers to represent such a people as a swarm of law∣less barbarians without order justice manners or character and ignorant of the first principles of every science Trials in Turkey remarks  Thevenot  ex∣cept in some very intricate cases seldom last above four or five hours so that the laws delay cannot be complained of in this country  To prevent murders and robberies during the night no person is permitted says the above author to walk the streets of Constantinople after it is dark except in the month of Ramazan Should the under bashaw who is captain of the watch and walks his rounds in the night like our constables meet with any person transgressing the law he is carried before the cadi who examines him and if he cannot give su∣cient reason for being in the streets after the night has set in though it should be even moonlight he is fined and bastinadoed and though he should be dis∣missed without any punishment being inflicted on him it is considered as a disgrace to have been even taken up and carried before the judge  Le Brun  likewise observes that if any person is found murdered and it is not known who committed the murder the person opposite to whose house the murder was committed if in the streets is fined to the amount of three hundred crowns From this law however the Franks are exempted If the mur∣derer be taken and the next of kin are minors he who committed the murder must remain in prison till they are of age  It is the office of the Bostangi Bachi to give the torture to those unfortunate persons from whom they endeavour by this cruel expedient to force a con∣fession  of whatever they may suspect to be concealed The place in which it is inflicted is called the oven of the Bostangi Bachi which name is given it from its situation Immediately on entering the walls of the seraglio are the barracks of the Bostangis near which is an oven used by the bakers to bake bread and biscuits for their use On one side of this oven is the prison in which those unhappy persons who are to undergo the torture are confined After the prayer  Yatson  which is at two in the morning when the Bostangis are retired to rest in their barracks the prisoners are conducted to a place at some distance to avoid the intercession of the Bostangis who are sometimes moved with pity at their sufferings and there the Bostangi Bachi inflicts on these unfortunate wretches several different kinds of torture When any one therefore is delivered into the hands of this terrible officer the common people say he is in the oven of the Bostangi Bachi  The principal punishments in Turkey for lesser crimes are the bastinado which is a certain number of blows given on the soles of the feet For this pur∣pose there is a kind of engine made of very thick wood in the middle of which are two holes about twelve inches apart into which they put the feet of the person who is to receive this punishment He is then laid on his back and his legs are tied to  this engine called by the Turks a  Falacca  Two persons upon this lift the Falacca so high that he who is to be punished touches the ground only with his shoulders which prevents his moving or making any resistance Two others then come with short sticks or rather laths about half an inch in thickness and give him the number of blows that he is sentenced to receive This punishment is very severe and will sometimes prevent a person from having the use of his feet for several weeks or months if it has been received to the number of three or four hundred blows for any great crime But five and twenty or thirty strokes the usual number are thought nothing of and will not prevent a person from walking about as before Some travellers mention their having seen persons receive the bastinado for selling articles of the most trifling value a little short of weight nay even for endeavouring to impose upon children though it might be only to the value of a farthing or two so rigid are the Turks in their adherence to justice  The bastinado is sometiems inflicted on the breech but then the drawers are not taken off In this man∣ner likewise the women are punished This cor∣rection is considered even more severe than that in∣flicted on the soles of the feet especially if a great number of strokes are given as the putrefied and dead flesh is afterwards obliged to be cut off with a  razor to prevent its turning to a mortification and the persons who have undergone this chastisement will be sometimes confined perhaps for many months to their bed The Turks are allowed to inflict the bastinado upon the soles of the feet on their slaves the dread of which makes them extremely attentive and submissive in their obedience to their masters Schoolmasters likewise do not whip their scholars as we do in England but correct them on the soles of their feet  One apparent good property of the civil law among the Turks is what we have in part before noticed which is the right every individual has of pleading in his own cause But of what advantage says the Baron is this privilege in a country where the judg∣ment is arbitrary Hence it arises that the Jews the Armenians and the Greeks have invested their chiefs with a kind of civil jurisdiction to which they some∣times submit to avoid having the property for which they contend devoured by the Cadi who decides the cause But except among the Jews who pay more obedience to the Kakam than the Christians to their patriarch it is very common for those adjudged to have been in the wrong to refer the matter to the Turkish judges A sufficient proof we think that the Turkish courts of law are neither so arbitrary nor so corrupt as the Baron would wish to insinuate  The law respecting slaves is another proof of the humanity and wisdom of the Turkish legislature it not only requires the master to part with his slave if the slave be dissatisfied with his situation and treat∣ment but it likewise refuses to admit the evidence of a slave either for or against his masters  The Emperor's council of state is called  Galibe Divan  and meets twice a week in the sultan's palace on Sundays and Thursdays The Grand visir sits as president with the two judges of Romelia and Na∣tolia one at his right and the other on his left hand When the Sultan convenes a general council to which all the grand persons of the empire are sum∣moned such a divan is called  Ajak Divani  the whole assembly standing  The high court of justice is generally held in a large hall of the grand visir's palace called  Divan Chane  The grand visir is obliged says  Busching  to sit four days in this hall to administer justice to the people unless which seldom happens he should be prevented by affairs of a very important nature In this case his place is supplied by the Chiaux Bachi or the master of requests The bills or re∣presentations of the parties are read and the assistant judges generally give their opinion of the cases laid before them if their verdict be agreeable to the  grand visir it is written on the  arzuhal  and the grand visir subscribes it if he disapproves it he him∣self pronounces a decree and orders a copy of it to be given to the parties By this means suits are soon brought to an issue in Turkey The same mode of administering justice holds through all the provinces  As to the revenues of the Turks it is very diffi∣cult for a stranger says  Habesci  to obtain a just ac∣count of them For this reason he adds I have undertaken to satisfy the reader on this head having myself been employed in those departments  All the revenues of the Ottoman empire are di∣vided into two departments one in the seraglio and the other in the city The principal is called  Miri  and the second  Kasna  The Miri is the treasury of the empire and the  Defterdar  directs it who has under him twelve officers to which all the revenues of the empire arising from tributes customs c are re∣turnable and from these the army is paid The treasurer is allowed the twentieth part of all the money brought into the treasury which brings him in near fifty thousand pounds sterling a year one fourth of which he is however obliged to pay to the grand visir's com∣missary The money of the treasury is called  Dei∣tulmali Muslimin  or the public money of the mus∣sulmen and it is not to be touched by the Emperor  but in cases of the greatest immergency much less for private occasions  The revenues of the empire paid into the Imperial treasury says  Habesci  amount to thirty millions of Turkish piastres without reckoning the produce of the gold and silver mines This income of thirty millions is drawn from various resources In the first place from the  Karag  which is the capitationtax that the Christians and Jews pay women excepted and likewise those who are under the protection of the foreign ambassadors Every male at the age of fourteen must pay this tribute it is divided into three classes the highest pays eleven piasters the middle class half that sum and the lowest only a fourth part of it If the state is urgent for supplies this tax is then doubled When the tax is only single it amounts one year with another to about six mil∣lions of piasters The saltpits and the fisheries pro∣duce about four millions more The disposal of par∣ticular places under government brings in another three millions The public funds produce five mil∣lions or more and the customs eight millions the three principal Customhouses are those of Constan∣tinople Smyrna and Salonica were the duties paid in these three places under the same regulations as the customs in other countries says  Habesci  they would bring in four times as much The taxes paid  on tobacco coffee spices and some other articles amount to four millions more which make in all the thirty millions abovementioned  The disbursements of the Imperial treasury are for the fleet the pay of the Janissaries and other landforces the salaries of the officers of state judges c with other incidental charges which al∣together greatly exceed the revenues This bank says  Habesci  is at present in a very bad state besides a debt of sixteen millions which it owes to the Grand Signior's treasury it is likewise in arrears to the Ja∣nissaries for their pay and to many of the civil of∣ficers for their salaries and pensions  The revenues of the  Kasna  or private treasury of the Grand Signior are of two kinds The tributes paid by different nations which are certain and fixed and the incidental revenues which are much more considerable These incidental ones are derived from the inheritance of the bashaws who die without heirs from pecuniary punishments from the tenth of all sorts of acquisition and from a part of the produce of the mines The silver ones situated in the neigh∣bourhood of Erzerom which formerly yielded a very great revenue now bring in little or nothing be∣cause there is no wood in the environs and the car∣riage of it becomes too expensive Those of Diar∣bekir  which were very abundant in the finest gold do not produce the sixth part of what they brought in formerly the people who worked them having been driven away by the continual incursion of troops  Notwithstanding these disadvantages the Grand Signior's treasury is in a very flourishing state The plunder of so many rich bashaws has brought in im∣mense funds and the sultans have for many years back reformed their household and limited their expences they have also lessened the salaries of their servants and even the ornaments of their wo∣men on which the sultans of former times bestowed immense sums As for the personal expences of the Sultan such as buildings clothes and gallantry they are defrayed says  Habesci  by his ministers  The Grand Signior is the sole dispenser of this im∣mense treasure and it is with the utmost difficulty he can be induced to lend any sum to the treasury of the state if its wants are not uncommonly pressing The ministers also on their part avoid as much as pos∣sible having recourse to him to shun the reproaches of a bad administration or the mortification of seeing their Sovereign chagrined at such an application  But when necessity obliges them to apply for re∣lief which has frequently been the case of late years  the Grand Signior who was of a timid disposition has instantly complied with their request but at the same time taken every precaution to be reimbursed as soon as possible and even with interest There are also certain political maxims in the seraglio for the management of this treasury which make the sultans deem it prudent to refuse as far as it lies in their power to part with any very considerable sums well knowing that with money they can at any time appease tumults that may chance to arise and prevent revolutions  CHAP XVII  Of the Crimea  THE Crim peninsula  Chersonesus Taurica  called in the Turkish maps says  Busching  the Crim island is of the same figure with the Morea and by the ancients reckoned to be nearly of the same ex∣tent It is environed by the Black Sea and the sea of Asoph except at the very narrow neck of land which joins it to the continent  In treating of Tartary we have already said some thing of the Crimea but it being a province wrested  MAP  of the  CRIMEA c  From D'Anville  map of Crimea  from the Turks by the Russians and now in their possession having rather a better opportunity here of describing it more fully we shall do it  The Precopite Tartars inhabitants of the Cherson∣nesus now called the Crimea or Little Tartary between the Wolga and the Tanais were till lately in alliance with the Ottoman Porte there existing between them and the Porte a reciprocal convention that if the male line of the Ottoman emperors should fail the Khan of Crimea was to succeed to the em∣pire of Turkey and in default of male issue in the Khan the Ottoman monarch was to inherit the Crimea This convention was the cause of that union which subsisted so long between them and for the same reasons the Tartars suffered patiently that their Khans should be elected by the sultan of Turkey who however could not choose any person that was not of the bloodroyal of the Khans In former times the eldest son of the Khan was required to re∣side at Constantinople as a hostage of the fidelity of the Crimea but for many years back this compact was not executed on the part of the Tartars they conceiving it unjust The present state of the Crimea however is very different from what it was only a few years ago for in the last war between the Otto∣mans and the Russians the latter nearly conquered the whole country It is true that at the conclusion of  the peace every thing was restored nearly to its former state but a short time after the quarrels of the royal family of the Khans occasioned infractions of the treaty Upon the death of the reigning Khan several pretenders laid claims to the vacant throne of the Crimea A principal article of the peace was the free and absolute independence of the Crimea and of the election of their Khans but of the two chief candidates one was partially supported by the Porte of which the Russians complained as an in∣fraction of the articles of independence The memo∣rials of the court of Petersburgh were not listened to upon which the Russians supported vigorously the party of the other competitor whose name was  Sabil Guerai  and immediately sent a body of troops into the country to his assistance Under this mask Russia seems to have accomplished the grand project of Peter I  The enemies of  Guerai  were overpowered he was elected Khan the Mussulmen Tartars were massacred and Russia actually reigns in the Crimea in the name of the prince she has protected  All the fortresses in the Crimea are in the hands of the Russians Kaffa not excepted of which city by an ancient agreement with the Tartars the Turks were allowed to keep possession and all their efforts  since to drive them out of the Crimea have been in∣effectual This country therefore at present may be said to be neither subject tributary allied or even friendly to the Ottoman Porte The interest of Russia is so well established in the Crimea that it is said many Tartars have been baptized by the Russian priests and one or more of their princes have even received an order of knighthood from the Empress  Lady  Craven  who has given a short but scientific history of the inhabitants of the Crimea from the earliest ages prefaces her intended expedition into that country from Petersburgh with sayingI am told that the air is unwholesome that the waters are poisonous and that I shall certainly die if I go there but as in the great world a new acquired country like a new beauty meets with detractors I am not in the least alarmed for a person not a Russian who has been there on speculation has given me so charming a description of it that I should not be sorry to purchase a Tartarian estate  I will now continued she endeavour to shew by remote and past ages that the Taunde must naturally become a treasure to posterityLong before  Homer  the first inhabitants of it as far back as can be traced were the Cimmerians a numerous and warlike people descended from the Thracians during their incursions  into Asia Minor they were robbed of their territo∣ries by the Scythians but preserved the Crimea longer than the rest The Scythians however drove them from the flat country in the sixth century prior to the birth of our Saviour but they remained concealed in the mountains calling themselves  Taourians  and from thence the peninsula took the name of Taourica Taourinia or Tauris  About years before the birth of Christ the people from Mitylene founded a monarchy in the Crimea which was governed fortytwo years after∣wards by Spartaeus This king and his successors we are told favoured the Greeks and in a great measure drove away the Scythians who were after∣wards entirely exterminated by the Samaritans At this period the Taourians from the mountains mo∣lested the new monarchy till  Mithridates  king of Pontus subdued them and made himself master of the whole peninsula About the birth of Christ the  Alains  made the kings who were possessors of the Bosphorus his tributaries and drove away the Taou∣rians These new masters held their power about a century and a half In the second century the Goths succeeded them and it was under their do∣minion that Christianity was first introduced into the Crimea The Goths were afterwards obliged to sub∣mit to the Huns and like all other possessors of the  Crimea when driven from the plains they in their turn took refuge in the mountains where they had their own sovereigns who were Christians In this manner they remained with separate principalities till the sixteenth century being tributary sometimes to one prince and sometimes to another when they were finally subdued by the Turks and garrisons placed in all the principal cities They likewise drove the Genoese from Kaffa the principal town in the Crimea where they had carried on a very ex∣tensive commerce for two or three centuries and forced the Tartars who had taken possession of the plains to be for some time tributary to them  The great market for Circassians of which we have heard so much and know so little says Lady  Craven  was at Kaffa where they came and sold their chil∣dren to Greeks Genoese Jews or Armenians who sold them in their turn at Constantinople but that was before the Turks had extended their power over the Crimea  When the sovereignty of the peninsula passed to  MengheliGherai  chief of the Tartars there were but few Tartarian inhabitants but the wars he was en∣gaged in against them on the borders of the Volga gave him an opportunity to bring back with him into the Crimea many thousand Noguais whom he obliged  to fix there He was followed in this method of peopling the country by his successors who furnished the  Kouban  and the country between the Don and the Dneister with their prisoners  It was in the thirteenth century that the inhabi∣tants of the plains in the Crimea were subdued by the Mongouls or Tartars who were governed in clans by their princes till  MengheliGherai  converted the Crimea into a kind of state The Goths paid a tri∣bute to these people as they had before done to the  Polouses  who were settled in the plains and whom the Tartars had conquered In the first part of the Tartarian reign a number of Kafes or Circassians established themselves in the Crimea with whom the Tartars carried on a great trade in the town of Krim from thence the peninsula took its name by which only it is known to the Orientals at this hour While the Latins were masters of Constantinople they car∣ried on a considerable trade there as did likewise the Venetians But the Genoese having by a treaty with one of the Greek emperors named  Paleologus  ob∣tained an exemption of all duties in the Grecian states and a free navigation of the Black Sea they began to monopolize all the trade of the Crimea Bloody wars ensued in which they were almost con∣stantly victorious and they rebuilt with the consent of the Mongoul Khan the town of Kaffa made it  the chief repository of their commerce and at last of such consequence that Kaffa for a time was the name by which the peninsula was called It is true they paid tribute to the Mongouls while these preserved their power but when their own intestine divisions had weakened it the Genoese shook off their yoke and the Mongoulian or Tartarian princes were even elected or deposed as the Genoese thought fit At this period the trade from India to the Crimea was di∣vided into two branches by the Amon the Caspian sea and Astrachan one ended at Tana the other proceeded by Bagdad and Tauris to Travespond and Savastopolis Tana belonged to the Genoese and Venetians under the supremacy of the Mongouls the Genoese having consuls at these two latter places  The Crimea was for a long time a formidable power to the Russians and Poles till these nations became improved in military science Until the peace of Carlowitz both these countries were obliged to pay to the Khan▪ to the amount of rixdollars annually to insure their countries from the incursions of the Tartars Russia however has gained ground by degrees and by arms and policy master of the peninsula the last Khan has a pension from the Empress and is retired to live as a private gentle∣man Long before he resigned his sovereignty the Turkish cabinet on one side and the crafty po∣licy  of the Russians on the other left him no peace even some hordes of Tartars insulted his tottering power At present there are about of the Empress's troops in that country besides about Cossacks in her pay and the Khan's palaces with some houses of the Tartarian nobles are fitted up for her reception in case she should chuse to visit that country  The meteors which the heavens here continually present as well as the whiteness of the Aurora Bo∣realis prove the purity of the atmosphere We may also attribute what we may venture to call its ethereal qualities to the immense dry plains which extend on the north of this country and to the neighbourhood of Mount Caucasus the heights of which attract and absorb all the vapours which rise to the west  Regular seasons which gradually succeed each other contribute with the goodness of the soil to produce the most abundant vegetation The same kind of black land mixed with sand extends from Leopold in Red Russia as far as the Peninsula The heat of the sun fructifies every kind of grain with very little labour from the husbandman who does nothing but plow the land he means to sow Melonseed with peas and beans mixed are scattered by a  man who follows the plough They do not even cover the grain but depend upon the rain to labour for them and the soil is abandoned to chance till harvesttime when they endeavour to clear the crop of the confusion which this mixture of seed renders inevitable  Among the numerous productions which sponta∣neously overspread the face of the Crimea asparagus walnuts and filberts are distinguished by their size The abundance of flowers is equally remarkable Entire fields covered by the small tulip form from the variety of their colours the most agreeable pictures  The manner in which the vine is cultivated in the Crimea serves not to meliorate the quality of the grape and we see with regret says Baron  Tott  that the finest situations in the world cannot deter∣mine the inhabitants to prefer them to the vallies The slips are planted in furrows of eight or ten feet diameter and four or five feet deep The superior part of these ditches serves to sustain the branches which thus supported cover the whole orifice with foliage under which hang the grapes that by this means are hid from the sun they are likewise abun∣dantly fed by an ever humid soil and moreover are often steeped in the rainwater there collected They  strip off the leaves a month before the vintage after which they take care to cut the vine near the ground and the vineyards remain during winter under water owing to the inundation of small rivers  Peysonnel  in a stricture upon Baron  Tott  who complains of the badness of the bread in the Crimea says during the four years he resided at Bagtcheserai one of its principal towns he eat very good bread which was all made by a Tartarian baker This bread was in cakes near an ell long very thin very light and perfectly well tasted I drank also an excellent white wine says he of the growth of the country great quantities of which are brought every year by the Cossacks of the Ukrain and the Russians and may be compared with our  vin de Chabli  I also found there in great abundance and extremely cheap turkeys fowls pullets geese and all sorts of poul∣try I cannot conceive says the above author what were become of the hares partridges wild ducks bustards woodpigeons plover lapwings snipes quails and thrushes with which we were so surfeited as frequently to prefer butchers meat and even salt provisions to these dainties nor where were the fresh cod and oysters with which Kaffa so frequently and abundantly furnishes the inland towns the fish of Baliklava the trout of the river Katchi and the fine lobsters of the brook Boulganak the melons and  watermelons finer and better than those of Pro∣vence the excellent and enormous cucumbers as large as our long gourds the artichoaks or the as∣paragus the largest and sweetest in the world The man who is dissatisfied in the midst of such plenty ought only to accuse his own abstinence or want of care His reproaching the Tartars with not being able to make butter is the more unjust because butter is one of the principal articles of their commerce The Crimea produces annually about three or four thousand quintals of this commodity which are equal to five thousand of our quintals Nearly as much is made by the Noguais of Djam∣boilook and the same quantity by those of Kouban The best sort called the flower of butter in the Turkish language is that with which the Grand Sig∣nior is supplied and a man must be no less unfortu∣nate to want butter in the Crimea than to be un∣able to procure wine in Burgundy or oil in Pro∣vence Lady  Craven  likewise testifies to the excel∣lence of the butter in the Crimea  Among the various species of those birds which abound in the Crimea says  Tott  the most remarkable is a kind of wildgoose with larger legs than ours and a plumage of a bright brisk colour The Tartars pretend the flesh of this animal is exceedingly dan∣gerous I tasted it says the Baron and only found it good for nothing  No country he adds has more quails than the Crimea and these birds dispersed during the fine weather assemble at the approach of autumn to cross the Black Sea over to the southern coast whence they afterwards transport themselves into hotter cli∣mates The order of this emigration is invariable Towards the end of August the quails in a body chuse one of those serene days when the wind blow∣ing from the north at sunset promises them a fine night They repair to the Strand take their depar∣ture at six or seven in the evening and finish a journey of fifty leagues by break of day Nets are spread on the opposite shore and the sportsmen are in waiting for their arrival to take tythe of the emigrants  Though the quantity of water is great in the Crimea it forms no considerable rivers the proximity of the sea suffers no current to be more than a brook the strongest heats never leave the channels dry and the inhabitants every where find limpid streams which meander agreeably through the meadows and wander among the rocks The Italian poplar flou∣rishes here and are numerous enough to make us suppose it a native of the Crimea if the Genoese establishments did not indicate by whom it may have been transplanted  The first observation of natural curiosity which presents itself in the Crimea is the uniformity of a bed of rocks which is found on the tops of all the mountains of the same level These rocks which rise more or less to the surface afford indisputable traces of water and bear the character of those which are at present exposed to the efforts of the sea They are likewise apparently interspersed with fossil oysters but so enveloped as not to be procured but by the aid of the chissel  Among the fossils which adhere to these rocks there is likewise the  Echinus marinus  or sea urchin the living species of which is peculiar to the Red Sea The vallies of that part of the Crimea contain exten∣sive beds of univalve fossils and almost all of the species called Chinese bonnets These fossils differ from those found in the Mediterranean by the su∣perior thickness of the shell So abundant are these shells in some vallies that they absolutely stifle vege∣tation They are mixed with fragments of soft gravel infoliated and herberised the principal bed of which is seen in the bottom of little gutters  The plains of the Noguais which extend along the continent of the Crimea are almost on a level with the sea whereas the isthmus is from thirty to forty feet more elevated This superior plain occu∣pies  the northern half of the peninsula after which the land intersected by rocks and loaded with moun∣tains running from west to east is overlooked by the TchadirDaegue or the Tentmountain This mountain placed too near the sea for its base to add much to its elevation can only be classed in the second order of mountains But if we cast an eye over the map we shall perceive in it that chain which connects the Alps with Mount Caucasus In fact we behold a branch of the Apennines which traverse Europe from west to east separate Ger∣many from Italy Poland from Hungary and Walla∣chia from ancient Thrace and after plunging in the Black Sea reappear in the same line on the southern coast of the Crimea scarcely leaving a pas∣sage for the communication of the sea of Asoph and the Euxine then continuing their route to the Cas∣pian sea under the name of Caucasus take after∣wards that of Thibet and extend themselves to the very eastern borders of Asia  These researches into pristine geography while they assert the progress of knowledge will no doubt cast a new light on an argument which the spirit of system has long since sustained The learned who shall be curious to know the first aspect of our globe will find it by following the same level the traces of which are every where distinct The highest moun∣tains  will afford them those levels which were first abandoned by the waters  The towns of most note in the Crimea are Kaffa Bachtcheseray the ancient residence of the Khans and Perekop or Orcapi a fortified place on the isthmus which joins the peninsula with the main land  It is probable that the town of Kaffa which is still the centre of commerce in the Crimea was likewise the place of greatest trade among the Genoese Yet considering the port of Baluklava and sometimes of ancient edifices to be seen there one is led to sup∣pose they did not neglect the advantages it possesses The inhabitants of Kaffa consist of Greeks Turks and Jews but the Greeks constitute the majority and enjoy a perfect freedom of religion even under the Khans Here are still several descendants of the old noble families of Genoa This town is the largest of all the Crimea and contains between five and six thousand houses North west of it are some very high mountains at the foot of which this town stands in a very delightful situation It retains a great deal of its ancient beauty and the walls that were built by the Genoese are yet remaining in many parts of which are to be seen their Latin in∣scriptions The finest Christian churches most of  which were built likewise by the Genoese have been converted into mosques Their arms still appear upon many of them as likewise the painted pieces of their saints but their statues and altars have been destroyed by the Greeks  Bactcheserai is the residence of the Cham of the Tartars and though now considered as the capital of the Crimea was formerly only a country seat called the palace of the gardens the sovereigns having fixed their residence in this place attracted inhabi∣tants to it and the city preserving its name has usurped precedency over the ancient town which is now only a poor village the former importance of which can only be gathered from its tombs  This town lies on the west side of the peninsula near the sea and is situated between two hills which serve to defend the place instead of walls This town says Lady  Craven  is situated in so steep a valley that some of the hanging pieces of rock seem ready to fall and crush the houses  In my way hither says she I dined at the Cossack's chief post and my entertainment was truly Cossack a long table for thirty people at one end a halfgrown pig roasted whole at the other a halfgrown sheep whole likewise in the middle of the table an  immense tureen of curdled milk there were several sidedishes made for me and the Russians as well as the cook could imagine to our taste  The old warrior with whom I dined would fain have made me taste above thirty sorts of wine from his country on the borders of the Don but I con∣tented myself with three or four all of which were very good After dinner from the windows I saw a fine mock battle between the Cossacks among which were three Calmucks the ugliest fiercest looking men imaginable with their eyes set in their head in∣clining down to their nose and having uncommonly square jawbones These Calmucks are so dexter∣ous with bows and arrows that one killed a goose at a hundred paces another broke an egg at fifty The officers of the Cossacks sung and danced but their tones were equally insipid and void of grace and harmony  When a Cossack is sick he drinks four milk for a few days and this is the only remedy they have for a fever  At night I lodged at a house that had belonged to a noble Tartar where there is a Russian post with about twelve hundred of the finest men I ever saw and uncommonly tall A Tartarian house has always  another building at a little distance from it for the convenience of travellers or strangers whom the noble Tartar always treats with the greatest hospi∣tality The palace inhabited by the Khan built first in the Chinese stile and afterwards repaired in the Turkish preserved some of the beauties of its first construction It stands on the outside of the town and is surrounded by very high rocks where water abounds which is distributed through the Kiosks and the gardens in a very agreeable manner This situation has one defect it presents no other pros∣pect than barren rocks and the Khan is obliged to walk to the neighbouring heights in order to enjoy a landscape but the most beauteous and variegated  The palace is an irregular building the greatest part of it is one floor raised upon pillars of wood painted and gilt in a fanciful and lively manner the arch or last doorway has very fine proportions and a large inscription in gilt letters as its principal ornament Court within court and gardens within gardens make a variety of apartments through which the Khan used to walk from his own residence to the Harem which is spacious and higher than the other buildings What had a very pretty effect was that several of the square courts under these apart∣ments were paved with marble and have fountains in the center continually playing The room allotted  for my apartment says her Ladyship was a square of more than forty feet having two rows of windows one above the other on three of its sides and it was with difficulty I found a place in it to put up my bed  This town contains about five thousand inhabi∣tants A great trade is carried on here for blades of swords hangers and knives many of which are so well tempered as not to be distinguished from those of Damascus Among the other excellent produc∣tions of the Crimea there is in this neighbour∣hood a mine of earth exactly like soap reckoned very good for the skin of which the Turkish ladies at Constantinople use a great quantity The profits of this mine which are very great are enjoyed by a Tartar who is married to the Kaima Khan or prime minister of the Khan  With this lady I was invited to dine whose Ha∣rem with her husband's house is situated in a very romantic manner at the foot of some very extraor∣dinary rocks from which many clear springs issue that supply the houses of this town and her baths with perpetual fresh water on the summit of these rocks there is a very singular appearance places where im∣mense cables have certainly passed and been tied The Tartarians insist that the sea once lay at the foot  of them and that ships were fastened to them We dined in the husband's apartment a very dirty shabby place for so rich a man Tartarian cookery consists in much grease and honey After dinner the Kaima Khan walked across a court and I was desired to follow I did so into another court where four women and some young girls met us and last of all his sister Her dress was magnificent particularly her girdle in the front of which were two circles like bracelet lockets and in the centres of them were two fine emeralds She offered me a large goblet which held two quarts of sherbet a very indifferent kind of lemonade after that coffee and last of all sweatmeats We conversed very well by signs she appeared neither old nor ugly but how is it possible to judge of a countenance hid under bad painting and eyebrows which join into one straight line drawn across the nose  I wore a  chemise  of two rows of very fine lace at the bosom that I thought would surprize her but lace and every magnificence which is not gold silver pearls or diamonds I am told passes unnoticed Linen is not much in use their shifts and the shirts of the men are generally made of very thin silk or silk mixed with cotton which is seldom changed but the very frequent use of baths makes this custom less loathsome than it would otherwise be  When she had quitted the Harem her brother staid behind a little and afterwards came up to me kissed the bottom of my gown and presented me a very beautiful handkerchief of his sister's embroi∣dery which I was told I must accept It was of muslin the borders embroidered with different co∣loured silks and gold and what I could not compre∣hend both sides are the same  Perekop situated on the isthmus in the Sclavo∣nian language signifies a cut made through any place being derived from the ditch dug here in very re∣mote ages across the neck of land at the entrance of the Crimea for the security of the peninsula and which has been from time to time repaired and of late fortified  Baron  Tott  in his description of this place says we arrived here in tolerable good time and passed the moat over a bad wooden bridge that joins the Counterscarp to a vaulted gate at the entrance of the platform the porter of which every night keeps the peninsula of the Crimea under lock and key No∣thing can have a grander effect than the fortifications of Orcapi another name given to the entrance of this celebrated peninsula The works indeed are some∣what of the gigantic but I know no place where na∣ture has been better seconded by art The solidity  of the entrenchments may be warranted it intersects the isthmus three quarters of a league in extent two seas serve it for epaulment it overlooks the plain beneath about the height of forty feet and will long resist the utter negligence of ignorance No marks indicate the time of its construction but every thing proves it anterior to the Tartars or at least that they were formerly better instructed than they are at pre∣sent The Russians in the last war could only pe∣netrate the Crimea by passing a small marshy arm of the sea and gaining the point of a very narrow neck of land which runs parallel to the eastern coast The same route had been successfully attempted by General  Munick  in the campaigns of and yet this could not inspire the Tartars either with the means or the desire to preserve themselves hereafter from a like misfortune by defending the extremity of that neck of land where the least resistance must have stopped the enemy's march  The saltpits of this place make part of the sove∣reign domains and are farmed out either to Arme∣nians or Jews and these two commercial na∣tions always rivalling each other mutually raise the produce of the tax by this contest They are equally unskilful in managing their works to the best advantage and their avarice is always the dupe of their ignorance They have sheds to receive dry  and preserve the natural salt formed in the saltlakes Hence the abundance of one year cannot compensate the deficiences of another when the rains wash away a produce so rich and so easy to stow in safety  We cannot quit the topographical description of the Crimea without noticing the harbour of Sevasti∣copolis from whence Lady  C  took shipping for Constantinople  The singularity of the coast of the harbour says Lady  C  is unlike any other I ever saw it is a long creek that is formed by the Black Sea between two ridges of land so high that the glory of the Catha∣rine one of the largest ships in the Russian navy which was at anchor here could not be seen from the land on the shore being above the pendant The water is so deep that this ship touched the land All the fleets in Europe would be safe from storms or from enemies in these creeks or harbours for there are many of them At the upper extremity stands Inkerman which must have formerly been a very considerable town at present the only remains are rooms hewn out of the rock Here is a large cha∣pel the pillars and the altar of which are ex∣tremely curious the stone is whitish and not unlike marble I climbed up a staircase continues our au∣thor and crept in and out of very extraordinary  spaces that were large and commodious I entered at the bottom of these singular habitations and like a chimneysweeper came out at the top and though it cost me not a little trouble in turning and climbing up so high I had no idea of having mounted so much till on looking about me I turned quite giddy in seeing the bay of Inkerman and all the Black Sea at least two hundred and fifty feet be∣neath the place where I stood  It is upon this southern part of the peninsula that vines are cultivated and grow wild in great abund∣ance at present only a few private people have vine∣yards The Empress has indeed a Frenchman here who seems however to care more about the strength of the wines being sufficient to make brandy which he distils in great quantities than in teaching the cul∣ture of the vines to the Russians The fine turf the excellent soil the orchards the climate are alone sufficient inducements to make any one partial to this country One very particular thing I took notice of was a small pink flower that spread like net∣work over the turfand asking what it was found they were peachtrees which when very young being nipped by the sheep grow into little bushes  Can any rational being see nature without the least assistance from art in all her grace and beauty  stretching out her liberal hands to industry and not wish to do her justice Yet I confess concludes her Ladyship I wish to see a colony establishing ma∣nufactures such as England produces and returning the produce of this country to oursestablishing a fair and free trade from hence and teaching industry and honesty to the insidious but oppressed Greeks waking the indolent Turk from his gilded slumbers and carrying fair liberty with her swelling sails as she passes through the Archipelago and Mediterranean to our dangerous happily for us our dangerous coasts  CHAP XVIII  Wallachia  THE ancient Dace which always had the highest reputation for the courage and valour of its people consisted of the three provinces of Transyl∣vania Moldavia and Wallachia All these three provinces were overrun by the Germans Polonese and Turks and not being able to hold out against such powerful neighbouring enemies they were forced to buy the protection of the Ottoman Porte by means of an annual tribute Transylvania from  the advantage of its situation upon the frontiers of the territories of the House of Austria settled with the Germans by an an annual tribute of gold ducats At present it is incorporated with the other hereditary domains of the German empire and the Transylvanians are very happy in comparison of the inhabitants of Moldavia and Wallachia The other two provinces remain subject to the Porte which sends them governors elected by the Grand Signior from amongst the ancient Greek families residing at Fanari To these governors the Porte grants the title of Vayvodes and of Beys and the honour of two tails which are carried before them when they come out of the divan of the grand visir after their appointment and pass through the principal streets with a numerous and splendid retinue on their way to the capitals of their respective principalities Their principal occupation in their government is col∣lecting the tribute which is generally paid to the Porte  Wallachia formerly paid no more than sixty thou∣sand piastres a year But after the rebellion of the inhabitants of this province in against the Porte a rebellion which was only suppressed by a bloody victory the annual tribute was greatly augmented and now amounts to two hundred and forty thousand piastres or about fifty thousand pounds sterling  For this province says  Habesci  it is a very ade∣quate sum and the inhabitants would be happy if they could enjoy tranquility upon paying even dou∣ble or treble that amount But the extraordinaries which they oblige them to pay sabre in hand are ex∣orbitant The Vayvode always keeps a grand court and a magnificent retinue His residence is at Buc∣corest no inconsiderable town says Lady  C  the situation of which is delightful To obtain the government he unavoidably contracts great debts which he must draw from the province but this is not all in order to keep himself in place by favour of his protectors at Constantinople he must make them annual presents and he will take care to amass sufficient treasures apart for himself against a re∣moval from his government if he is so fortunate to leave it without losing his head To compass all these ends the most horrible cruelties and extortions are constantly practised The inhabitants are reduced to the utmost misery and not being able to live any longer under such a yoke seek for refuge in some more humane country This humanity they experi∣ence in the territories of the House of Austria  The former governors of Wallachia could supply all the charges of their election and investiture with less than an hundred purses in our days they must levy twenty times as much such is the Ottoman  avarice and Greek ambition If the governors have the good fortune to be dismissed from their employ∣ments with their lives they have always the title of Bey and their sons the same There are several of these beys at Constantinople and the richest of them scarcely better than a poor man but they possess in the place of money a very great share of pride and contempt  The Wallachians considered as inhabitants of the country are descended from the old Roman colony settled here by the Emperor  Trajan  This is evident not only from their language which is a barbarous Latin intermixed with several foreign words but likewise from their customs and their diet their thick pottages and onions of which they are very fond their dress and attachment to the Italian lan∣guage as also to the Italians themselves and to whatever comes from their country  Buccorest or Bucharest the usual residence of the Prince is a large straggling town of a very pecu∣liar form the outward parts are very mean consist∣ing of houses the greater part of which are under ground like our cellars and covered on top with straw or bark of trees The better sort of houses are near the Prince's palace and covered with handsome wooden tiles though the walls are built of very sub∣stantial  stone having spacious courtyards and gar∣dens to them enclosed by trunks of oaks set as near as possible to each other The streets appear like a continued bridge being floored from side to side with massy planks of ten yards long and as many inches thick which work how expensive soever it may seem is continued through all the buildings of the place for an extent of some miles The prospect of the city is pleasing at a distance on account of the houses of the nobility the palace of the Prince and the number of churches and convents These last are all of one form regularly built and rising with cupolas  About two miles from the town is a convent called in the Wallachian language the  Catrochan  which is accounted the most beautiful of several in this pro∣vince and therefore a short account of this may serve as a specimen for the rest  It is situated on the Dembowctza which washes it on two sides while the other two are adorned with a grove of lovely close and shady oaks The neigh∣bouring pastures afford an entertaining prospect whereas the parts near the convents are disposed into regular wellordered vineyards and gardens The fabric itself is an oblong quadrangle built of regular and massive stone divided into cells for about forty  monks with lodgings for the abbot a common re∣fectory kitchen and other public apartments But in the middle of the area is erected the chapel of the exact figure of the ancient Greek churches that is distinguished into the porch outward chapel body of the church chancel and altar the several parts being regular and stately supported with pillars and covered with cupolas The ornaments of painting gilding and embroidery are excceding rich and the pictures so numerously disposed as to possess every part of the church in the inside as well as the out∣side of the front Here also are kept the two horses' tails allowed by the Turks to be carried before this prince together with the  bandier  of the province and another called the paschal colours in which the Holy Trinity is prophanely represented and God the Father expressed by the image of a reverend old man looking over the body of our Saviour as it hangs upon the cross  The air of this province is temperate the soil very fruitful particularly in grain with which it is obliged to furnish the market of Constantinople when there is a scarcity in Egypt The wines of this province says  Chishull  especially about Tergovist are exqui∣sitely fine It is likewise in great repute for its most excellent horses The province is well watered by a considerable number of large and small rivers which  discharge themselves into the Danube and which makes it so luxuriantly rich and abounding with woods and pastures though but thinly inhabited and that in caves and huts rather than houses Its chief income proceeds from wax honey hides horses saltmines and the customs on some places of the Da∣nube By these it is able to maintain its prince and barons splendidly besides paying a yearly tribute to the Turk which is settled at three hundred and twenty purses equal to thirtytwo thousand pounds sterling besides three times that sum extorted beyond the compact The lands of the province are entirely in the hands of the prince and barons the rest who are peasants being all either slaves or servants whose persons or service are at the disposal of the several nobles on whom they depend  The prince has all the rights of sovereignty ex∣cept that of declaring war and coining his own mo∣ney Justice is here performed according to the an∣cient laws of the province which are agreeable to the Roman law The power and act of pronouncing sentence is wholly in the breast of the prince after which as in Turkey the execution immediately ensues For the better adjustment of tribute and other common duties the whole province is divided into seventeen counties of which each is to furnish its respective proportion In time of war it ordi∣narily  maintains twenty thousand men of which about the fourth part continues in pay in time of peace  The Wallachians profess the eastern Greek re∣ligion and as in their writing they use the same letters with the Russians so they agree with them in using the same religious ceremonies The common∣ality are most wretchedly ignorant and even the highest attainments at which the ecclesiastics aim seldom goes beyond reading and singing well  The churches of each parish as well as the chapels of many monasteries which are seen here are usually very pleasing to the eye well built richly adorned profusely painted and for the most part furnished with bells though in some places may be seen the wooden plank common to the Greek churches in Turkey where bells are not permitted The porch of their churches is generally daubed with supersti∣tious representations of the punishments of hell and oftentimes the inside of these churches is prophaned with some inconsistent corporeal image of the Holy Trinity a thing permitted here against the professed principles and declarations of the Greek church The government of them is subject to the patriarchs of Constantinople  Persons of rank among the Wallachians are so fond of the Italian language that they apply them∣selves to it more than to their mothertongue and generally send their sons to the university of Padua Great numbers of the Mahometans live also inter∣mixed with the Wallachians  I visited the press of this place says  Chishull  where I found them printing some pieces of devotion in Arabic under the care of the patriarch of Antioch to be by him distributed about his diocese Besides this they were undertaking to print a large folio of the famous  Maximus Hieromanachus  being the course of the several Sundays throughout the year On this occasion I bought several Greek books lately printed in this province one of which contained all the liturgies hymns rituals lessons and other de∣votional tracts used on all occasions in the Greek church through the course of the whole year  Such of our fashionable female readers as roam in imagination to foreign courts may probably not be a little amused and delighted with Lady  Craven  's mag∣nificent reception at the court of the prince of Walla∣chia A coach says her Ladyship made I believe in the year came to the door with six brownbay stonehorses that seemed to spurn the earth they trod on and with grooms walking by the side of each  of the horses A kind of chamberlain with a long flowing robe embroidered all over with gold and a white staff in his hand accompanied by the prince's private secretary attended to conduct me The whole town by this time was got round the equipage and we proceeded very slowly to the first court of the palace in which I went through a double row of guards some of them Janissaries and the others Arnauts and Albanians In the second court there was another double row of the same guards that ex∣tended up a large flight of steps leading to the au∣dience chamber in the corner of which a space was divided off with cushions upon which sat the prince dressed and attended  a la Turque  over his head were ranged the horses' tails the great helmet and feather the magnificent sabre and other arms with which I had seen him parade the streets of Constan∣tinople Coffee and sweetmeats were served on my entrance after having partook of which and re∣mained some time in conversation I rose to take my leave when one of his chamberlains desired me in a whisper to set down again my ears were then immediately assailed with the most jarring noise I ever heard Upon which with a very grave loud voice the secretary said  "c'est pour vous Madame c'est la musique du Prince"  and the prince desired me to look out into the court There I saw trumpets of all kinds brass plates striking together and drums of  all sizes some of which not larger than breakfast cups were ranged on the ground and the strikers of them squatted on the ground to beat them Each musician was endeavouring to drown the noise of his neigh∣bour by making a louder if possible I do not know that my nerves were ever so tried before This scene however did not last long I was then called to have an audience of the princess She was sitting  a la Turque  with three of her daughters by her who were about nine ten and eleven years old The princess might be about thirty she had a very handsome face something like the Duchess of Gordon only the fea∣tures and countenance of the latter have more soft∣ness and her skin and hair are fairer Her person was rather fat and she was above six months ad∣vanced in her eighth pregnancy She took my hand and seated me by her There were twenty ladies in the room one of whom instead of a turban had a high cap of sable put behind her hair that was combed up straight over a kind of roll This headdress was far from being ugly or unbecoming The princess told me it was a lady of Wallachia and that the cap was the dress of the country After the princess had asked me all those questions usually put to travellers I was desired to sup with them to which I consented but requested I might return to my lodgings to write to Constantinople I scarcely had got home when two of the prince's people with the secretary came  in followed by many more of his houshold The secretary desired me to go and look over a gallery that surrounded the back court of the house I did so and saw a beautiful Arabian horse in the midst of a great mob with two Turks holding his bridle The secretary told me the prince hearing I was fond of horses desired me to accept that which a bashaw of threetails had given him a few days before and he hoped I should accept it with the regard with which it was presented I gave him as civil an an∣swer as I could imagine and very handsome presents in money to the grooms and to the whole set of stablepeople  The supper was served in a more magnificent man∣ner than I should have imagined a table upon legs and chairs to sit on were things I did not expect The prince sat at the end of the table his wife on one side and I on the other Several ladies sat down to supper with us The princess had nine females be∣hind her chair to wait upon her Several silver things were set upon the table accidently the produce of England such as saltsellers cruets c c but there were four candlesticks that seemed to be made of alabaster set with flowers composed of small rubies and emeralds that were very beautiful Detestable Turkish music was played during the whole supper but relieved now and then by Bohemians whose tunes  were quite delightful and might have made the heaviest clod on earth desire to dance The prince saw the impression this music made upon me and de∣sired they might play oftener than the Turks It seem says Lady  Craven  these Bohemians are born slaves the property of the reigning prince of Walla∣chia There are as he told me five thousand of them left formerly there were five and twenty thou∣sand About half past eleven I rose to take my leave and received from the princess several very beautiful embroidered handkerchiefs and was obliged again to excuse myself from staying only a twelvemonth with her which she said would be a great amusement to her as my presence was full of graces I retired with all the attendants I had before only with the addition of I believe a hundred flambeaux and all the Turkish and Bohemian music playing by the side of the large gold coach  This horrid discord and comical procession got the better of my gravity and though the secretary was there I laughed all the way to the Consul's house where apartments were prepared for me Mr  V  's ideas of good breeding a gentleman in the carriage with me were so discomposed by my laughing that he assured the secretary the  perfection  of my ear for music was such that the least discord in it made me laugh and he repeated this in all the ways he could  turn it I said  Oh oui c'est bien vrai  but between while I said in English what would you have me do I feel like punch parading the streets with all these trumpets and this mob about me  CHAP XIX  Bessarabia Oczakow Tartary  c  THE country comprized under the name of Little Tartary contains according to Baron  Tott  not only the Crimea but the Kouban a part of Circassia and all the lands which separate the em∣pire of Russia from the Black Sea This circuit con∣tinued from Moldavia almost to Taganrog is from thirty to forty leagues wide and nearly two hundred long From east to west it includes Yetitchekoolai Dgamboylook Yedesan and Bessarabia This latter province is inhabited by Tartars who as well as those of the Crimea have fixed habitations in their villages but the inhabitants of the three other pro∣vinces have only felt tents which they carry where∣ever they please  Those people called Noguais Tartars are settled in the vallies that traverse their plains from north to south and their tents ranged in a single line form there a kind of villages of thirty and thirtyfive leagues in length which distinguish the different hordes  It may be presumed that the rustic frugal life which these people lead favours population as it is observed that the people are less numerous un∣der the roofs of the Crimea and in the provinces of Bessarabia than in the tents of the Noguais The best calculation we can make is from a view of the military forces which the Cham is able to as∣semble This number says Baron  Tott  during his residence in that country amounted to men and the Baron adds that the Cham was able to raise double that number without prejudice to the neces∣sary labours of the state  The revenues of the Cham notwithstanding the numerous armies he can bring into the field scarce amounts to pounds sterling for the main∣tenance of his houshold The raising of forces is no expence to him All estates are held by military tenure Neither does the Sovereign support any ex∣pence of justice he decides all disputes throughout his states gratis as each jurisdiction does in its respective districts  The Cham of the Crimea though sovereign over these provinces is only so in the nature of Lord Pa∣ramount These provinces have their nobility whom the Cham is obliged to convoke on all extraordinary occasions the government retaining the old feudal system established in Europe some centuries back and to which it is supppsed these Tartars gave rise  The towns of most note in these provinces are Bender a Turkish fortification on the Dniester fa∣mous for the retreat of  Charles  XII in after the battle of Pultawa where he remained four years and Oczakow taken from the Turks in the last war between them and the Russians  Oczakow is a very strong place situated at the in∣flux of the Dnieper into the Black Sea It receives its Turkish name from the Dnieper by the Turks called Ozi and lies on the declivity of a mountain with a castle above it When Count  Munich  sat down before it in the year its fortifications were in excellent order and its garrison consisted of a large body of chosen Turkish forces but the Count com∣pelled by want of fodder for the horses and other cattle risqued an assault and carried it the third day after opening the trenches The Russians held the place till the following year when they evacuated it after having demolished the works  This fortress says Baron  Tott  occupies a small de∣clivity which leads to the river A  fossé  and covered way are the sole works which defend the place It has the form of a parallelogram inclined lengthways and here may be seen says the Baron a numerous artillery each piece of which illmounted is en∣folded by two enormous gabions which serving for merlons form the embrasures  The Boristhenes the ancient name given to the Dnieper the entrance of which river this citadel is meant to defend is confined and narrow towards its mouth by a projection of land on the opposite shore called Kilboornoo by and within which a kind of lake is formed lengthened towards the north from whence the river descends Its width is more than two leagues from Oczakow to the opposite fort situated on the sandy point in which direction it is usual to cross the Boristhenes The vessels used on these occasions carry sail when the wind is favour∣able and are pushed also with boathooks owing to the shallowness of the water which is never too deep to make use of them except for a few fathoms to∣wards the middle  After three hours of this tiresome navigation says  Tott  who crossed this river in his way to the Crimea we landed at Kilboornoo opposite the castle Its  artillery destined to cooperate with that of Oczakow in defending the river could not send its fire to a sufficient distance but must always permit an entrance through the middle Were batteries situated on Kil∣boornoo point and others on the opposite shore they would constantly secure the entrance of the river against every kind of vessel  The country between the Dniester and the Dnieper by some called Yedesan and by others Oczakow Tartary is inhabited only along these two rivers and near the sea the other parts being quite waste and therefore called Dzike Pole or the desart plain It affords however good pasture but has not a single tree upon it In the year after the unfortu∣nate battle of Pultawa  Charles  XII travelled over it in his road to Turkey suffering inexpressible hard∣ships by the way  Such is the only information we have been able to collect respecting this fortress the retention of which Russia thought a sufficient equivalent for the suc∣cesses of a glorious war it was however so strongly opposed on the part of the Turks by the mediatory powers of Prussia and England before it was con∣sented to be yielded up to them as nearly to have embroiled all Europe in war and which nothing per∣haps prevented being more strongly contested by the  mediating powers but the unwillingness of the lower class of people in this country to our being engaged in a war with Russia  The importance of this fortress to Russia must be very evident when it is considered that it commands the entrance of a river in which are her principal docks for building ships to navigate the Black Sea and from whence all her naval stores must descend to furnish the harbours of the Crimea  Ismahel says  Tott  a town of Bessarabia on the left of the Danube near its mouth serves as a maga∣zine for the sending corn down the Danube and fur∣ther adds a species of industry peculiar to itself which is the manufacturing of shagreen skins called by us Turkish shagreen Here are places round the town set apart for dressing them At first they are worked like parchment and are sustained in the air horizontally by four poles so disposed that they may receive the impression of a very astringent little grain with which they are covered after standing a certain time they are found perfectly prepared and finished  Notwithstanding the barren picture which these countries constantly offer and the facility with which a comparison might be drawn between this soil and  that of Moldavia and Poland yet such is the force of of habit that it vanquishes all sensations The No∣guais conceive it impossible to traverse their plains without envying them their possession You have travelled a great way said one of the Tartars to Baron  Tott  but did you ever see a country like ours  The plains we crossed says Baron  Tott  in the memoirs of his journey from Moldavia into the Crimea were so level and open that no irregularity could be seen not so much as a tree or a shrub It was now near sunset says the Baron and I saw nothing before me but a vast melancholy plain when I suddenly felt my carriage descend and beheld a file of tents to the right and left extending further than the eye could see  These vallies which intersect the plains from north to south are about eight or ten fathoms deep and though more than thirty leagues long are but half a quarter of a league wide Muddy rivulets run through the middle of them and terminate towards the south in lakes which communicate with the Black Sea  On the borders of these rivulets are the tents of the Noguais as well as the sheds meant to give shelter during winter to the numerous flocks and  herds of these pastoral people Each proprietor has his own mark which is burnt into the thighs of horses oxen and dromedaries and painted with colours on the wool of sheep The latter are kept near the owner's habitation but the other species united into herds are towards the spring driven to the plains where they are left at large till the winter when they seek them out and drive them to their sheds  What is most singular is that the Tartar em∣ployed in this search has always an extent of plain which from one valley to another is ten or twelve leagues wide and more than thirty long yet does not know which way to direct his search nor troubles himself about it He puts up into a bag six pounds of the flour of roasted millet which is sufficient to last him thirty days This provision made he mounts his horse stops not till the sun goes down then clogs the animal leaves him to graze sups on his flour goes to sleep awakes and continues his route He neglects not however to observe as he rides the mark of the herd he happens to see These dis∣coveries he communicates to the different Noguais he meets who have the same pursuits and in his turn receives such indications as help to put an end to his journey It is certainly to be feared says the Baron that a people so patient may one day furnish formi∣dable armies  No appearance of culture is to be seen on any route because the Tartars avoid the cultivation of frequented places Their harvest on the side of roads would serve only as pasture to travellers' horses But if this precaution preserve them from this kind of depredation nothing can protect their fields from a much more fatal scourge Clouds of locusts fre∣quently alight on their plains and giving the pre∣ference to their fields of millet ravage them in an instant Their approach darkens the horizon and so enormous is their multitude as to hide the light of the sun When the husbandmen happen to be suffi∣ciently numerous they sometimes divert the storm by the agitation of their cries but when these fail the locusts alight on their fields and these form a bed of six or seven inches thick To the noise of their flight succeeds that of their devouring activity it resembles the rattling of hailstones but its conse∣quences are infinitely more destructive Fire itself eats not so fast nor is there a vestige of vegetation to be found when they again take their flight and go elsewhere to produce fresh disasters  The shores of the PontusEuxenus towards the Bosphorus of Thrace are sometimes covered half leg deep with their dry remains Curious to know the true cause of their destruction says  Tott  I sought the moment of observation and was witness of their  ruin by a storm which overtook them so near the shore that their bodies were cast upon the land whilst yet entire This produced an infection so great that it was several days before they could be approached  No people says Baron  Tott  are more abstemious millet and mare's milk are their habitual food and yet they are exceedingly carniverous A Noguais might wager that he would eat a whole sheep and gain his bet without danger of indiscretion But their appetites are restrained by their avarice which is so great that they generally debar themselves of every thing they can sell If any accident should kill one of their cattle says the Baron they then only regale upon his flesh and this not unless they find it time enough to bleed the dead animal They follow this precept of  Mahomet  likewise with respect to beasts that are distempered carefully observing each stage of the disease that they may seize the moment when in their avarice condemned to lose the value of the beast their appetite may still afford them some consolation by killing it an instant before its natural death  The fairs of Balta and others established on their frontiers are the emporium to which they annually bring their immense flocks and herds The corn they grow in such abundance finds a ready vent by  the Black Sea as well as their fleeces To these ob∣jects of commerce are added some bad hides and great quantities of hareskins  These different articles united annually produce the Tartars considerable sums which they only receive in ducats of gold Dutch or Venetian but the use they make of these annihilates every idea of wealth They are continually augmenting without turning any part of their store into circulation Avarice seizes and engluts these treasures while the plains in which they are buried afford not the least indication or guide to future research  Notwithstanding the avarice of the Noguais Tartars the hospitality of the inhabitants of Bessarabia ap∣pears to have been equally in the extreme We ar∣rived before dark at a village in Bessarabia says the above author at which my conductor intended we should sleep He stopped in the midst of an open place surrounded by houses where I remarked each inhabitant stood at his door with eyes fixed on us while the Tchoadar looking round examined them one after another  Where are we to lodge said I I do not see that any one cares You are mistaken answered he Every one is waiting and wishing for the preference  whosever house you shall wish to fix upon you will make the master happy  During this discourse I observed an old man standing singly before his door His venerable air interested me The lot fell upon him and no sooner was the choice made than all the inhabitants reen∣tered their houses The ardour of my new host ex∣pressed his satisfaction and as soon as he had shewn me into a clean lower apartment he brought his wife and daughter both with their faces uncovered the first carrying a bason and a pitcher and the second a napkin which she spread over my hands after I had washed them  Preinformed by my conductor I submitted with∣out difficulty to what hospitality dictated to these good people After ordering supper and leaving the care of preparing it to the women the old man who till then had supposed me a Tartarian nobleman undeceived by the Tchoadar came immediately to beg I would excuse the small means he had of re∣ceiving me properly My answer made him easy and as I wished to question him on the surround∣ing objects I obliged him to sit down smoke and partake of some coffee which my servant had brought  This little civility which a Tartarian nobleman would certainly not have paid my host confirmed him in his inclination towards me I then desired him to tell me why with a view solely of exercising hospitality they subjected themselves to a custom the inconvenience of which he at present found and which might ruin the most wealthy individual if by chance the choice of travellers should frequently light on him only  Old Man  I feel in the preference you have given me nothing but the pleasure of having obtained it We consider the exercise of hospitality as a benefit and should any one constantly enjoy that advantage he could only make others jealous but we do not permit the use of any means which might determine the choice of travellers Our eagerness to come to our doors is only to prove that our houses are in∣habited their uniformity preserves an equality and my good star alone has procured me the happiness of of having you for my guest  Baron  Pray tell me would you treat the first comer with the same humanity  Old Man  The only distinction we make is to go and meet the wretched whom misery always renders  timid in this case the pleasure of assisting him is the right of the first person who arrives  Baron  The law of  Mahomet  cannot be fulfilled with greater exactitude but the Turks observe not the alcoran so faithfully  Old Man  Nor do we believe that in exercising our hospitality we obey this divine book We are men before we are Mahometans Humanity has dictated our customs and they are more ancient than the laws  My host at his departure shewed himself faithful to his principles it was impossible to make him re∣ceive the present with which I would gratefully have acknowledged the reception he had given me  The Baron who aims to prove that Europe was originally peopled by Tartars and not by Goths and Vandals as is generally supposed notices the furni∣ture under this hospitable roof which was a fourpost bedstead with a tester bed chairs and tables and enquired if these were Tartarfurniture  Old Man  We know of no other  Baron  I am the more astonished at that since the Moldavians and Turks have not such furniture and  I scarce can conceive by what route these European customs have arrived here Why have you not adopted as well as your brethren of the Crimea the furniture of the Turks  Old Man  You may see some customs here un∣known to our ancestors but depravity cannot make the same progress in these parts as in the Crimea where our sultans set the example of Turkish effe∣minancy to which they have been accustomed in the capital of the empire  Baron  I perfectly feel this distinction but it throws no light on the origin of the European furni∣ture I see here  Old Man  Yet nothing can better mark that origin This familyfurniture cannot be European we are the root of the tree it is your furniture which is Tartarian  This answer served but to excite my curiosity and multiply my questions and I had the pleasure to hear my host repeat all I had myself conjectured on this subject He informed me also that the Tartars near the Caspian Sea and those beyond it preserve the same customs  The form of the Tartarbeds above cited as well as the throne of the Grand Signior which always represents a fourpost bedstead have a similarity which may appear interesting If we consider that the first governments were necessarily paternal and that the Tartars afford in this as well as in many other mat∣ters the most ancient annals we shall not be asto∣nished that the form of the bed on which their elders ought naturally to give judgment has been adopted as a model for the throne of the east If we add to this remark the invasion of all Europe by people originally Tartars we shall find an explanation of the term Bed of Justice always employed in France when the power of sovereign majesty is fully exerted  Peysonnel  in reply to these conjectures says that the Goths whose emigrants followed those of the Vandals were like these latter Celtic and Teutonic nations and had neither the same origin nor came from the same countries as the Tartars and yet the Tartars known by the name of Huns did not overrun the western part of the continent till long after the Goths and even the Sclavi The language of the Vandals and Goths was the Celtic or Teutonic the mother of the German that of the Sclavi whom we must not confound with the Vandals is the mother of the Sclavonian Russian and Polish and and the Tartar language from which the Turkish is  derived has not the least similitude or analogy with the two others The Goths came from the North and originally inhabited those countries which lie between the Northern Ocean and the Baltic Sea The Huns under which general name are comprized all the Tartar tribes who have extended themselves towards the West came from the East and from that flat high land which extends to the North and the chain of the mountains Caucasus and Tibet continued almost as far as the peninsula of Corea  The following particulars relative to their archi∣tecture may says  Tott  be of some utility to those who are interested in rural economy though not to the disciples of  Vitruvius  we beg leave to add if sufficiently intelligible  Pillars placed on the points which determine the angles and openings kept in a perpendicular position by a beam on which uprights are fixed form the first plan and are disposed so as to receive and sup∣port the roof This accomplished other perpendicular pillars but smaller at twelveinch intervals are erected round which hazel twigs are twisted in the manner of basketwork This kind of wickerwork they fill with mud mixed with cut straw which they plaister with hairmortar within and without and the whole whitewashed and painted on the pillars bases  doors and windows gives the building an agreeable aspect  This manner of erecting is infinitely more solid than it appears to be in description and is certainly more healthy than the mode of building among our peasants in the remote parts of the country I am likewise convinced that landholders who wish either from interest or motives of benevolence to build cottages in hopes of favouring population would be every way gainers by adopting this new method of construction The expence is small and they would thus give each cottager the means of easily repair∣ing his own habitation  The simple and easy mechanism of their tents like∣wise deserves to be described The Tartars habitually encamped ought consequently to have brought the art of making them to perfection The whole force of their faculties is employed on this the first of ne∣cessities to a nation which has never known the luxu∣ries of indolence and which has therefore bent all its powers towards those things in which the exercise of the body the chace and the implements of war are concerned  A light paling which can easily be packed and un∣packed forms a little circular wall of four feet and an  half high Its two extremities kept near three quar∣ters of a yard distant make the entrance into the tent A score of small rods which join at the upper ends and at the lower have a leathern ring by which they hook to the paling form the dome and support the roof which consists of a cowl or co∣vering of felt that descends and spreads over the walls which are lined also with the same stuff A girdle includes the whole and some earth or snow thrown up round the bottom of the tent▪ prevents the air from penetrating and makes it perfectly solid without post or cordage Others of a nicer con∣struction have the cones circularly open at top which apertures give passage to the smoke permit fires to be lighted in the tents and render them in∣accessible to the intemperance of the most rigorous climates  The tent of the Cham was of this kind but so large that more than sixty people might commodi∣ously sit round a wood fire It was lined with crim∣son stuff furnished with some cushions and had a circular carpet  The best education of the Tartars goes not beyond reading and writing but though the education of the Mirzas or Tartarian nobility is neglected they are eminent for their easy politeness This is the effect  of their familiar habits of living with their princes without ever failing to pay them a proper respect  There is no country where crimes are less com∣mon than in Tartary their plains where malefactors might easily escape yield but few temptations and the peninsula of the Crimea which affords more ob∣jects to rapidity is daily shut up and leaves not the culprit the smallest hope to escape punishment  Having already said a great deal of the different tribes of Tartars when speaking of Siberia c we will pass on to other matters  CHAP XX  Moldavia  IT has been already observed that Moldavia is sometimes comprehended under the name of Wal∣lachia considered in which light that part of it lying on this side the mountain is called Wallachia This country takes the name of Moldavia from the rivulet  Moldau which runs from the upper parts into the country mingling itself with the river Sereth Its length extends from west to east that is from the river Sereth to the Dneister between thirty and forty Hungarian miles and the breadth is about seventy  Its principal rivers are the Sereth the Pruth and the Dneister which form the boundary towards the east and north All these three rivers receive se∣veral smaller streams in their course and the first two fall into the Danube which is the boundary to the south but the latter discharges itself into the Black Sea  The soil we traversed says Baron  Tott  in his de∣scription of this province drew all my attention new landscapes equally interesting by a rich cultiva∣tion and a vast variety of objects presented them∣selves at every step and I should have compared Moldavia to the province of Burgundy if this Gre∣cian principality had possessed the advantages which result from a moderate government  But alas the condition of Moldavia is not better than that of Wallachia It is governed by a Greek who procures the appointment by the same means and having the same interested views the consequence  is clear that he must make the subject suffer equal oppressions  The sums paid to obtain the government and for the investiture cannot be ascertained it depends more or less on the number and character of the can∣didates and upon the honesty of the members of the divan If these two provinces were governed as they should be they would be well peopled and very rich no soil being more fertile for at present though the ground is almost uncultivated yet it yields even in those years not the most plentiful an hundred for one in wheat and all other sorts of grain There are very commodious rivers for ren∣dering commerce easy their lands produce various articles to carry it on to advantage such as wine wool leather honey wax and large and small cattle But the rivers are no longer navigated the country wants inhabitants those in easy circum∣stances have not courage to cultivate the earth be∣cause they would only labour for others We see tracts of land the best and most fertile perhaps in Europe of ten leagues in extent entirely uncul∣tivated  Long ruled by their princes according to the faith of treaties these people ought still to have been free from the effects of despotism and so they might  had not their princes been removable at the pleasure of the Ottoman Porte Liable at first only to a very small tribute Moldavia as well as Wallachia at that time enjoyed a share of liberty In the persons of their princes they beheld if not men of merit at least men of illustrious families whom the conqueror respected But all was presently confounded the subjected Greeks beheld themselves slaves and emu∣lation and distinction were lost among them The trader was elevated to a principality every factious pretender put in his claim and these unhappy pro∣vinces frequently set up to sale presently groaned beneath the most cruel vexations  The town of Yassi the capital of this province situated in a boggy soil is surrounded by hills which every where present rural prospects and on which might be built the most agreeable country houses instead of which a few cattle are scattered over them and if we except the houses of the  Boyards  or great landholders and those of the Greeks who come from Constantinople in the suite of the prince all the other habitations of the capital bespeak the utmost misery  The  Boyards  represent with great arrogance the grandees of the country though in reality they are only rich proprietors of lands and cruel taxgatherers  Seldom do they live in amity with their prince but generally are intriguing against him and Constan∣tinople is the centre of their factions Hither doth each party carry his complaints and his money and the Sultan Seraskier of Bessarabia affords a ready refuge to those Boyards whom the Porte thinks proper to sacrifice to its tranquillity The Tartar prince gives safety to the Boyard and under his pro∣tection he is often reestablished but for this pro∣tection he must pay  These various expences which the Boyards reim∣burse themselves by oppressing individuals added to the taxes which the prince imposes to pay his annual tribute overburden Moldavia so much that rich as is its soil it is scarcely sufficient This province as well as Wallachia when they submitted to  Ma∣homet  II on condition of both being governed by Grecian princes and only subjected to a moderate taxation did not make so good a bargain as the au∣thors of the treaty imagined It was not foreseen that the vanity of the Greeks would put the govern∣ment up to auction they were equally blind to the fatal consequences of that clause by which the Grand Signior reserved the right of removing them at plea∣sure It is evident this power of removal cannot fail of carrying taxation to the most grievous excess and that universal depredation must be the necessary  consequence and thus we find that the whole art of these subaltern governments consists in seizing and employing every means which can accelerate this devouring rapacity  Nothing can display the oppressed state of the in∣habitants of this province more than the violence ex∣ercised towards them in order to procure provisions by the milkmanders or conductors whose office it is to precede and prepare the way for ambassadors and others who travel at the expence of the Porte  A family instantly dislodged to make room for us says Baron  Tott  who had one of these conductors appointed to attend him through Moldavia two sheep killed roasted eaten and not paid for and blows unnecessarily distributed put me out of hu∣mour with my conductor who set off the same even∣ing to prepare the means of transporting my carriage across the Pruth This stream separates the Pacha∣lick of Kotchim from Moldavia  Ali Aga  the name of the milkmander had on the evening before swam to the opposite shore where with the assistance of his whip he had assembled three hundred of the Mol∣davians employed them the whole night in forming trunks of trees into a crazy raft and had repassed upon it to our side My conductor proud of having constructed so great a work invited me to remount  my carriage And how said I will you get it safely down to the edge of the river Or how will you af∣terwards keep it on your rickety raft scarcely big enough to contain it and which must sink under its weightHow By the help of this said he shew∣ing me his whip and above a hundred bony peasants whom he had brought from the other shore Be under no apprehensions I would make them carry the uni∣verse on their shoulders if the raft sinks these merry fellows can swim and I will sustain it should you lose so much as a pin I would hang them every one  The name of God first pronounced followed with a plenitude of lashes were the signals to begin They unharnessed and brought the carriage in their arms to the edge of the precipice There I beheld them not without shuddering ready to be crushed beneath the weight of my Berlin Arrived at the water's edge the next thing necessary was to set the raft afloat which the hundred Moldavians at length accomplished guiding it some wading some swimming with long poles to the other side where buffaloes ready prepared were harnessed to the carriage and in a twinkling I saw it on the summit of the opposite cliff  It may easily be imagined that  Ali Aga  was tri∣umphant and that having been transported with my  suite on the other side by a second return of the raft I did not depart without giving some five or six guineas to the workmen but what may not be readily supposed and what I had not foreseen myself was that my conductor ever attentive to all my actions and my most trifling gestures stayed some time be∣hind to reckon with these unfortunate labourers for the small salary they had received  He came up to us in about an hour and posted on to prepare our breakfast about three leagues fur∣ther where we joined him while he was providing food for us by means of the same tool with which he constructed our raft Had he not made a too fre∣quent use of this weapon I should have liked him very much says the Baron I therefore undertook to correct this battering propensity  Baron  Your dexterity and the good cheer you procure us would leave me nothing to wish for my dear  Ali  were you not to beat these miserable Mol∣davians so often or were you to beat them only when they were disobedient  Ali Aga  What matters it to them since I must beat them whether it be before or after And is it not better to proceed to business at once than after loss of time  Baron  Loss of time And is your time then well employed in beating wretches who have not offended  you and who with the utmost submission alacrity and goodwill execute things almost impossible  Ali Aga  What Sir have you lived at Con∣stantinople do you speak our language and know the Greeks and yet are ignorant that the Molda∣vians will do nothing unless you first give them a good threshing Do you suppose your carriage would have passed the Pruth without the exercise I give them all night and till you arrived at the side of the river  Baron  Yes I believe that without being beaten they would have done every thing you ordered them through the fear of it But be that as it may we have no more rivers to cross the posthouses must furnish our horses and we shall only want provi∣sions which articles I am most interested in and let me be frank with you my dear  Ali  the morsels you cut for me with the lashes of your whip stick in my throat Leave me to pay for what I have that is all I desire  Ali  You would certainly take a good method to avoid indigestion for your money would not even procure you bread  Baron  Be that my concern I will pay so libe∣rally that I will have every thing of the best kind and with greater speed than you can procure it  Ali  I can assure you that you will not get so much as bread I know the Moldavians they in∣sist  upon being beaten besides I am ordered to de∣fray your expences every where and these infidelrascals are rich enough to support the heaviest im∣posts This they will think a light one and will be satisfied provided they be well beaten  Baron  I beg my dear  Ali  you will grant my request I am willing to pay for every thing and I will engage that they will be willing to be paid as well as to be kindly treated only suffer me to ma∣nage this matter  Ali  But we shall be famished  Baron  No no I have taken it into my head and must make the experiment  Ali  Well you are positive and so be it but remember it is not just that I should go without my supper and when your oratory and money have failed you will no doubt let me take my own method  Baron  Certainly and these stipulations being agreed to I must beg that when we approach the vil∣lage where we are to sleep the mayor may be sent to me that I may treat with him amicably for pro∣visions c  In that case said  Ali  there is no occasion for my going before He then ordered one of his people to ride on and do what I had desired and again re∣peated smiling that he would not go without his supper  Faithful to his engagement my conductor when we alighted went towards the fire sat himself down silently enjoying my approaching disappointment I on my part was not less eager in my hopes of pro∣curing nourishment I asked for the Mayor they pointed him out I approached laid down ten crowns upon the ground and spoke to him in Turkish and in Greek in the following Terms  Baron  Here my friend here is money to buy the provisions we want I have always loved the Moldavians and cannot bear to see them illtreated I beg you will immediately procure me a sheep and some bread Keep the remainder of the money to drink my health  N B  A good live sheep is worth halfacrown  Moldavian  He not know understand  Baron  How Not understand Don't you un∣derstand Turkish  Moldavian  No Turkish he not know understand  Baron  Well let us talk Greek then Bring me a sheep and some bread that is all I ask  Moldavian  No breadPoorHe not know un∣derstand  Baron  What have you no bread  Moldavian  No BreadNo  Baron  Unhappy people I am sorry for you but you will escape beating at least and that is something It is disagreeable no doubt to lie down supperless  you however are a proof that this misfortune happens to many honest peopleYou hear my dear  Ali  and must own if money can have no influence neither could your stripes These poor creatures have no food for which I am more sorry than for my own momentary necessities We shall have the better ap∣petite tomorrow  Ali  Oh no for my part I assure you it will not be better to morrow than it is tonight  Baron  It is your own fault Why did you let us stop at so wretched a village where they have not so much as bread Fasting must be your punishment  Ali  A wretched village Sir if the darkness did not conceal it you would be enchanted It is a small town where every thing is to be had in great abundance even cinnamon  N B  The Turks are very fond of this spice they put it into all their sauces and compare it to every thing that is most exquisite  Baron  So so I suppose your whippingfit is come on you again  Ali  By no means Sir it is only my supping fit which certainly will not leave me And in order to satisfy my appetite and prove to you that I know the Moldavians better than you permit me to speak  Baron  And will your flogging abate your hunger  Ali  Most undoubtedly If you have not an ex∣cellent supper in a quarter of an hour you shall re∣pay me every stroke I bestow  Baron  I take you at your word but remember if you punish the innocent I will most certainly re∣turn your favours and wi  h a hearty good will  Ali  As heartily as you please do you only re∣main as silent during my negociation as I did during yours  Baron  That is but reasonable I will take your place  Ali Aga rises hides his whip and taps him on the shoulder  How goes it my friend how goes itWhy dost not speak What dost thou not know thy friend  Ali Aga  Come come speak  Moldavian  He not know understand  Ali Aga  He not know understandAh ha This is astonishing But sincerely my friend dost thou not understand the Turkish language  Moldavian  No he not know understand  Ali Aga knocks him down with his fist and keeps kicking him while he rises  Take that rascal take that then to teach thee  Moldavian  in good Turkish  What do you beat me for Do you not know very well we are poor people and that our princes scarcely leave us the air we breathe  Ali Aga  to the Baron  Well Sir you see I am an expert master he speaks Turkish already mira∣culously We shall now be able to have a little con∣versation together  To the Moldavian leaning on his shoulder  Since it appears my friend thou under∣standest the Turkish tongue tell me how fares it with thyself thy wife and thy children  Moldavian  As well as it can with people who are often in want of necessaries  Ali  Pshaw thou art joking friend thou art in want of nothing except of being well basted a little oftener but all in good time Proceed we to busi∣ness I must instantly have two sheep a dozen of fowls a dozen of pigeons fifty pounds of bread four oques or ten pounds of butter with salt pepper nutmeg cinnamon lemons wines sallad and good oil of olives all in great plenty  Moldavian  weeping  I have already told you we are poor creatures without so much as bread to eat Where must we get cinnamon  Ali  taking his whip from under his habit and beating the Moldavian till he runs away  You have nothing have you infidel knave I will make you rich in a trice the same way I made you find your tongue  The Greek flies and Ali Aga returns and sits by the fire  You see Sir my recipe is something better than yours  Baron  To make the dumb speak I grant but not to get a supper for which reason I believe I am a quantity of stripes in your debt your method of procuring provisions being no better than mine  Ali  Oh there will be no want of provisions If in one quarter of an hour precisely all I have or∣dered does not arrive here's my whip take it and use it as I have done  In fact the quarter of an hour was not expired before the mayor assisted by three of his brethren brought all the provisions without forgetting even the cinnamon  After such a proof says Baron  Tott  how could I continue to plead in behalf of humanity My error was inconceivable I submitted and in spite of my feelings left my conductor to provide food in future without disputing about the means  CHAP XXI  Bulgaria  THIS province is bounded on the North by the Danube on the East by the Black Sea on the South by Mount Haemus which separates it from Romania and on the West by Servia It is thus named from the Bulgarians a branch of the Sar∣matae and was formerly called Lower Mysia The Danube which runs through this country for the space of eighty miles receives the Ister at Axiopolis It has another river Ischar which rises in Mount Haemus and falls into the Danube near Nicopolis  At the foot of the mountain which divides Bul∣garia from Servia is a warm bath where the water gushes out in a stream about the size of a man's body and but sixty paces from it in the same valley is a spring as cold as ice the smell however mani∣fests that they both contain nitrous and sulphureous particles On this mountain is a Greek convent for monks of the order of St Basil In the frontiers of Servia between the mountains of Suha and the river  Nessava are several warm baths whose waters are of a sulphureous quality and issue from the mountain being deeply tinged with the red sands and stones which it contains At the foot of mount Witoscha a few miles on this side Sophia towards the borders of Romania are also four warm baths of great repute in this country and the mountain exclusive of its iron mines is covered with villages cornlands meadows and vineyards  The country in general may be said to be very mountainous but the levels and vallies are extremely rich and fruitful producing wine and corn even to superfluity The mountains too are also far from barren affording excellent pasturage in parti∣cular that of  stara plamina  which reaches as far as Widin being towards its summit quite bare and de∣solate but in the middle and lower part extremely fertile  This province says  Chishull  however decried by  Ovid  and disparaged by our modern geographers for the richness of its soil variety of rising and fall∣ing ground elegance of prospect and a competent provision of wood and water is perhaps not to be paralleled by any other spot in the universe  Among the natural curiosities of this country are also to be reckoned the vast number of large eagles in the neighbourhood of the town of Bababagi where the archers all over Turkey supply themselves with feathers for their arrows though these feathers are in number only twelve and those only in the tail of this bird each of which are commonly sold for a crown  As an instance of the longevity of the people of this province  Chishull  mentions having seen an old Bulgarian Christian named  Staon  aged one hun∣dred and twenty years who told him he had all his life been subject to great and continual sickness and had three times changed his teeth once in his in∣fancy and twice in his old age They were now for the most part entire says  Chishull  his senses of hear∣ing and tasting very lively and his sight but little decayed his beard and his eyebrows had of late be∣come perfectly black but the hair of his head was milkwhite and the skin of his breast like the bark of an old weatherbeaten beech  The Great Balcan formerly called Hoemus is a chain of mountains which rise to a great height one upon another and extending themselves first from east to west take afterwards another direction from north  to south which separates part of Thrace from the Sardian territory of Dacia  In crossing the highest chain of the mountains of Balcan says  Tott  the aspect of their different strata the variety of the rocks which nature seems to have broken with effort only to afford indications of the treasures she there incloses present at each step those great characters which extend our ideas on her origin and lead us to contemplate her works with still greater ardour and interest  The ascents over these mountains are very steep says Lord  Baltimore  and lie in the midst of great woods the road or rather track is in as bad a con∣dition as can be conceived one high hill is no sooner surmounted than you descend rapidly into a deep valley full of rocks mud and water  Chishull  gives a more pleasing account of his pas∣sage over these mountains From Dobral near which place is a large town famous for dying and preparing the fine purple and yellow leather which it vends in great quantities we begin to ascend the foot of Mount Hoemus where the road winds so artificially as to take away the difficulty of ascent Here crossing a rapid river which forms its channel in the body of the mountain and through a variety of diverting  shades and clifts we arrive at length at an open plain on the top of the hill and there at a true country paradise of Bulgarian Christians called Challikca∣vack and here says  Chishull  I happily attained that wish of  Virgil  O qui me gelidis in vallibus Hoemi  Sistat ingenti ramorum protegat umbra  GEOR LIB ii v  "Oh that I were in the pleasant vallies of Hoemus  "Reposing under the lofty shades of its trees"  The damsels of the parish entertained us with a dance which though performed with no great art or variety in the steps and figure had a certain plain∣ness and simplicity which was very pleasing The ornaments of their dress were a sort of cravat con∣sisting of various silver coins and large bossy silver bracelets and we were dismissed the next morning with corn strewed in our way  On the top of the hill we proceeded for some time in a level road through a stately grove of oaks after which the road begins to descend and being shortened by the pleasure of the shady scene on each side leads unexpectedly into the adjoining plain In this we travel about an hour near the foot of the  delightful Hoemus and then find our quarters ready to receive us at a Christian village called Tragoe And indeed all the villages we had hitherto passed from Adrianople were entirely inhabited by Chris∣tians who by nation are Bulgarians but by their faith of the Greek communion  Near this village is Eski Stambol a name given by the Turks to the remains of an ancient city possibly the  Oescus Triballorum  which at the foot of Hoemus shews the entire tract of two walls the inward one square and about a mile in circumference the out∣ward almost circular and containing the compass of five miles But besides these it has no reliques of carved work or any inscription that may give light to the true name or history of the place In one corner only of the inward wall are several crosses and an image of the Virgin mother barbarously cut with two or three rude lines of modern Greek cha∣racters By the abovementioned walls runs a small river from the Hoemus now called by the Italians Monte Argentato and by the Turks Batkan  It should be remarked that the above author was then in the suite of our ambassador which may ac∣count for his superior accommodations to those of a private individual I was informed says Lord  Bal∣timore  we should have a view of the Adriatic and  Black Seas at once from the summit of the Great Balcan but I suppose we did not mount sufficiently high though I was often struck with the immensity of space and prospect around us  We suffered a deal of fatigue adds his Lordship in passing these mountains and were very near losing all our baggage which together with ourselves was often preserved by the strength and care of our attendants  We crossed one river more than sixty times which meandered through the woods between stones and stumps of trees rendering the passage very danger∣ous and rugged These woods are very dangerous to pass says his Lordship even as far down as the banks of the Danube being full of thieves and straggling parties of libertine Crim Tartars who are very civil and friendly to strangers in their own country but abroad are the greatest villains and thieves imaginable So much are they so that a very little while before we passed through Moldavia they had plundered great part of it carrying away men women children cattle and whatever else they could lay their hands on and this they do notwith∣standing their strict alliance with the Grand Signior who does not think it prudent to attempt to chastise  them but partly by threats and partly by presents persuades them to desist  The journey we have made hither says Lady  M  from Belgrade to Adrianople cannot possibly be passed by any person not in a public character The desert woods of Servia and the inaccessible parts of Mount Hoemus are the common refuge of thieves who rob fifty in a company so that we had need of all our guards to secure us and the villages are so poor that only force could extort from them neces∣sary provisions Indeed the Janissaries had no mercy on their poverty killing all the poultry and sheep they could find without asking to whom they be∣longed whilst the wretched owners durst not put in their claim for fear of being beaten This is literally and exactly true however extravagant it may seem and such is the natural corruption of a military go∣vernment their religion not allowing of this barba∣rity any more than ours  In that part of Mount Hoemus or the Great Bal∣can which borders on Romania there are but two passages one of which it is said was made by the Em∣peror  Trajan  and capable of being defended by a small force against a very numerous army  The Emperor  Trajan  's gate stands among hills says  Busching  where the steep rocks and dreadful pre∣cipices scarce admit of any access It was erected by that emperor in commemoration of his marching an army through this country having made himself a road through places before impervious It consists of two stone pillars with an arch over them repre∣senting a large open gate This building is now very ruinous and is composed of hewn stones and bricks The curious in subjects of antiquity have been too busy in taking off the stones which has greatly de∣faced this stately monument  The other pass is near a little river called by the Bulgarians Saltiza this passage is not so strait and narrow as the other but being full of rocks and dangerous precipices may be defended by a small force  Nor are those parts which lie on the confines of Macedonia more easy of access for when  Perseus  the last king of Macedonia had fortified those passes against the Romans it was believed says  Florus  there was no passage left for the enemy unless they fell immediately from heaven What renders the passage of these mountains still more difficult for an army is the excessive cold felt on their summits and which has been the destruction of many thousands  few constitutions being able to pass suddenly from extreme heat to that of cold without being incom∣moded  The towns of most note in this province is Sophia one of the most beautiful towns in the Turkish em∣pire and the capital of the province It is also fa∣mous for its hot baths that are resorted to both for pleasure and health Each house has a garden well planted with trees and shrubs The river Ischa in some places takes its course through the town and in others winds along the environs It is the resi∣dence of a Beglierbey and was built by the Emperor  Justinian  out of the ruins of Sardica which was its ancient name The more modern one of Sophia it is supposed to derive from the empress  Sophia  wife of  Justinian  This town says Lady  M  is situated in a large beautiful plain on the river Ischa and sur∣rounded with distant mountains which affords such a fine  coup d'oeil  that it is hardly possible to see a more agreeable landskip The city itself is very large and extremely populous  Silistria is likewise a town frequently mentioned in history a large and well fortified town on the Da∣nube At no great distance are the remains of the wall erected by the Greek emperors against the in∣cursions of the barbarians Very few of the inhabi∣tants  of this place are Turks Its great antiquity is evident from the walls which have all the appearance of Roman and not Turkish architecture  The inhabitants of the plains in this district who derive their descent from Tartarian emigrants are noted for their singular hospitality which is so great that when a traveller of any religion or country what∣ever passes through any of their villages all their housekeepers of both sexes come out to salute him entreating him in the most obliging manner to take up his lodgings with them and kindly accept of what God has been pleased to bestow on them The per∣son whose invitation the traveller accepts entertains him and his horses if they do not exceed three for the space of three days and that too with a cor∣diality and chearfulness which can scarce be paralleled  On the confines of these plains and on the borders of the Black Sea lies Varna the place where it is said  Ovid  was sent into banishment but the chief part of his time was passed at Tomi in this province to the west of Varna The borders of a lake where he often walked have become famous says Lady  C  and the gentleness of his manners and the sweet tone of his voice have been recorded down to the present inhabitants He represents the inhabitants as  covered with the skins of beasts and characterises them by the breeches they then wore  braecataque turba Getarum  He describes Tomi as a town for∣tified with walls where he was obliged to keep close for fear of the barbarians who used to take advan∣tage of the Danube being frozen over to plunder the opposite shore  Varna lies about two days sail from Constantinople with a fair wind By this route Lady  Craven  re∣turned to Vienna passing through Wallachia and Transylvania The mountains we have already de∣scribed over which she must otherwise have passed being then infected with such a large body of robbers that a whole regiment of soldiers would scarce have been a sufficient escort  The inhabitants of this province according to Lord  Baltimore  are of the race of Scythian Tartars who speak a dialect of the Sclavonian language They came originally from the oriental Scythians who in∣habit the banks on the other side the river Wolga to the north of the Caspian Sea They are Chris∣tians and are said to have adopted that religion from the discourses and miracles of certain bishops whom these barbarians in their incursions into the Roman empire had taken prisoners  The habitations of the peasants are of a conic form in the shape of sugarloaves whitewashed within side but having neither chimnies windows nor fur∣niture in them  This province says  Busching  is divided into four sangiakships or governments of officers next in rank to a bashaw of two tails The Beglierbey who has under him twentyfour of these sangiaks in this and the adjoining provinces resides at Sophia  CHAP XXII  Macedonia  IS bounded on the North by the river Nessus or Nestus east by the Archipelago on the south it joins Thessaly and Epirus and on the west Al∣bania The figure of it is very irregular but the situation very advantageous and the air clear sharp and healthy The soil is in general fertile and the maritime coasts in particular abound in corn wine oil and every thing that can be desired either for use or pleasure In the inland parts are several un∣inhabited wastes It had mines formerly of almost all kinds of metal but particularly of gold Among  the many high mountains in this country is that chain of the Scardi which traverses the northern part of it Pangaeus was formerly noted for very rich silver and gold mines The mountains of Hoe∣mus join the Scardi separating this country from Romania Mount Athos is one of the most cele∣brated mountains in the whole world and shall be particularly described in the sequel Of woods and all kinds of timber here is great plenty and the many fine bays in this province are a great conve∣nience to trade The most remarkable of these are the Golfo di Contessa  sinus strymonicus  Golfo di monte santo  sinus singiticus  and the Golfo di salo∣nico  sinus Thoermaeus  The principal rivers are the Platamone  Aliaemon  which runs into the bay of Salonichi the Vistriza  Erigion  which mingles with the following viz the Vardar  Axius  the greatest river in all Macedonia taking its rise in the Scardian mountains and falling into the bay of Salonichi  The Strymon rises in Romania or Thrace and discharges itself into the Golfo di Contessa  Besides the bays formed by the Vardar and Stry∣mon there are some others of note  Macedonia having been formerly inhabited by se∣veral nations had a great number of towns The  most remarkable places in it now are Salonica an∣ciently Thessalonica situated at the bottom of a bay in the Aegean sea to which it gives its name be∣tween two and three hundred miles west of Constan∣tinople and Mount Athos commonly called Monte Santo on which are twentytwo convents besides a large town well fortified the residence of the bashaw  Mount Athos lies on a peninsula running out into the Aegean sea and is indeed a chain of mountains extending the whole length of the peninsula being seven Turkish miles long and three in breadth but it is only one single mountain that is properly called Athos Its uncommon heighth appears from the ac∣count of  Plutarch  and  Pliny  who affirm that when the sun is at the summer solstice probably a little before its sitting the mountain casts its shadow as far as the marketplace of Myrrhina in the island of Lemnos which in the best maps is fiftyfive Italian miles distant whence the height of Mount Athos may be inferred to be about eleven stadia On it are twentyfour convents of Caloyers or Greek monks of the order of St  Basil  besides a great number of cells or grottos with the habitations of no less than six thousand monks and hermits though the proper hermits who live in grottos are not above twenty the other monks are Anchorites or such as live in cells It is evident from  Aelian  that  anciently the mountain in general and particularly the summit was accounted very healthy and con∣ducive to longlife whence the inhabitants were called  Macrobii  or longlived We are further in∣formed by  Philostratus  in the life of  Apollonius  that numbers of philosophers used to retire to this moun∣tain for the better contemplation of the heavens and of nature and after their example it unquestion∣ably was that the monks built their cells These monks who are called inhabitants of the holy moun∣tain are so far from being a slothful set of people that besides their daily offices of religion they per∣form all manner of work cultivate the olive and vineyards are carpenters masons stonecutters clothworkers taylors c They live also a very austere life their usual food instead of flesh being vegetables dried olives figs onions fruit cheese and on certain days Lent excepted fish Their fasts are many and severe which with the healthfulness of the air renders longevity so common there that many of them live above a hundred years In every convent are two or three studying monks exempted from manual labour but who use exemplary dili∣gence among the many celebrated writings of anti∣quity to be found in their libraries Here it is the Greeks chiefly learn their divinity The monks are in high esteem for the orthodoxy of their doctrine and the sanctity of their lives These convents and  churches have bells which are rarely allowed to the Greeks and are also environed with high and strong walls planted with cannon against any surprize from corsairs Besides churches and convents the moun∣tain also has a town called Kareis inhabited also by monks and the residence of the Turkish com∣mander who is appointed by the Bostangibachi to defend the place against the corsairs In this town a market is held every Saturday among the monks and anchorites which last bring hither knives and little images in order by exchanging them for money to purchase bread but the monks more indolent carry them about every where and receive alms for them This mountain is under the protection of the Bostangibachi to whom it annually pays twelve thousand dollars and a much larger sum is paid at Salonica to the use of the Grand Signior This heavy tribute is discharged by alms and the liberal contributions of Russia and the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia No fowls or cattle are kept upon this mountain though on paying a certain considera∣tion graziers are allowed to fatten their cattle here  Some narratives says  Tott  have pretended they possess a collection of valuable manuscripts but it is much more certain they do not read them It is equally true that the books of the ancient Thessa∣lonica as well as those of Constantinople have been  since the conquest of those places locked up and that the barbarians have poured melted lead into the locks so that the remains of Grecian literature de∣livered into the hands of superstition and ignorance are so carefully concealed by those enemies of learn∣ing that we can scarce flatter ourselves we shall ever be able to recover any fragments of it from their tyranny  The town of Salonica is situated at the bottom of a gulph of the same name from whence it extends to the foot of an adjoining mountain It is defended by three old castles towards the sea which are but in a ruinous situation and there are two more in the upper part of the city Its circumference may be about five or six miles and it is surrounded by a strong wall The houses are wood painted red and towards the top black where are generally inscribed some verses from the alcoran or some lines of eastern poetry in gilt letters Most of them are or∣namented with terraces and the courtyards frequently contain cypresses the favourite tree with the Turks who are naturally of a melancholy cast The streets in general have wooden projections from the houses to screen passengers from the heat of the sun which impedes the circulation of air and of course makes the town less healthy  This city was anciently called Halia and Therma but Cassander having rebuilt it called it by the name of his queen  Thessalonica  who was sister to  Alexander the Great  To its admirable situation for trade is per∣haps owing all the regard which the several con∣querors of Macedonia have shewn it The advan∣tages derived from it are such as are scarce to be met with elsewhere and as it attracted the admiration of the ancients so it has the encomium of the moderns Nor is it distinguished only by the greatness of its traffic but it is also very remarkable for the stately remains of its ancient grandeur such as triumphal arches churches of an extraordinary beauty and stateliness now converted into Turkish mosques particularly that of St  Demetrius  which consists of one church built over another and having in it above a thousand pillars of jasper porphyry c  In this and other churches are the monuments of several celebrated personages and without the city are great numbers of antique fragments with inscrip∣tions Numbers of coins are also frequently found here It is the residence of a Turkish bashaw and likewise of a Catholic and Greek archbishop who has eight suffrages under him In the year the city was sold to the Venetians who were dispossessed of it about eight years after by  Amurath  the second The Christians were so very considerable formerly in  this city that St  Paul  has addressed two of this epistles to them  This town says  Bisani  to which  Cicero  was ba∣nished at the instigation of his antagonist  Verres  still contains some remains of antiquity both sacred and profane In the mosque of St  Sophia  is a pulpit of  verd antique  from which St  Paul  according to tradition preached to the Thessalonians The Turks hold this monument in great veneration At some distance from this mosque which was formerly a Greek church may be seen an amphitheatre half sunk into the earth ornamented with basreliefs In another part of the city is the portico of an ancient temple though the columns and figures of it are mu∣tilated some of them are finely executed and par∣ticularly a Leda Scarce any of the streets are with∣out columns and pieces of marble with Greek in∣scriptions which the Turks have employed in the construction and ornamented of their houses  The burial places are out of the town near the seashore Every grave has two stones as at Con∣stantinople one at the head and the other at the foot of the grave Near some of them says the above author I saw fountains with wooden bowls placed in a kind of  niche  for the convenience of those who chose to drink  In the upper part of the town is the burial place allotted for those who have been victims to the plague While we were absorbed in these melancholy but useless reflections on the innumerable calamities which afflict mankind says  Bisani  some Turkish children were amusing themselves by pelting us with stones thrown from slings and saluting us with the usual compliments of being infidels a title with which they are accustomed to distinguish the Franks  In returning home we met with a very pretty Turkish girl between fifteen and sixteen Her eyes the only thing we could distinguish were inexpressi∣bly fine When we were near her one of our party had the imprudence to make signs to her which is a sure means of being assassinated A little boy who accompanied her was extremely angered at this mark of disrespect and looking at us with all the fury of a child he put his hand to his poignard and muttered something to us in Turkish which we could not un∣derstand Not chusing however that any other Turks should come up and explain it to us we thought it most adviseable to turn down a different street and decamp  The street  swarm with sparrows doves crows ravens storks dogs and cats which no person dares to modest much less to kill as the Turks  would in that case put them to death like the Egyptians of old  They reckon about eighty thousand inhabitants in this city the Jews who have several synagogues here make above one fourth of this number the Greeks and the Franks another fourth part and the Turks the remainder If a Turk stands in need of the services of a Jew he generally honours him with the title of pimp cuckold or some such pleasing ap∣pellation It is true they do not mind being buffeted or illtreated provided they are paid for it  While we remained at anchor here says  Bisani  we had Turkish visitors every day to see our vessel who expressed themselves full of rapture with every thing they saw while they kept counting their beads The petitmaitres carry about with them in Lent chap∣lets the beads of which are made of very fine trans∣parent stones and fastened by a silver chain to their girdles They have gold watches and the hilts of their sabres which they all wear are ornamented very curiously with embossed silver We had also some Greek peasants who came to visit us whose dress was very singular Over a woollen robe the ground of which was white and worked with a va∣riety of colours they wore a kind of short cassock without sleeves which covered only part of their  neck while the remainder was imperfectly concealed by necklaces of Turkish money intermixed with antique medals Their hair which was divided into ringlets hung loosely down their shoulders In this manner they formed a circular dance placing the musician in the middle who while he played imi∣tated the different steps they were to perform and sung different couplets which they repeated  It is well known that idiots make their fortunes in the Mahometan countries or at least that they live at their ease without being obliged to work for their livelihood In the corner of a coffeehouse in this city says  Bisani  we saw a negro woman lying on an old matt with scarce any covering on her who was old and ugly as the very devil though she did not seem to be sensible of it She would swallow down any thing even snuff and tobacco which shewed she had entirely lost that reason which the gods are said to have given us in their anger Yet she lives free from care and has no wants which the piety of true believers a name by which the Mussulmen dis∣tinguish themselves have not anticipated and pro∣vided for above these ten years I saw another idiot amusing himself in the streets with caning some of the Janissaries This respect which the Mahometans have for fools is carried sometimes even to adoration Of which the following is an instanceA Caliph of  Bagdad having heard there was a fool who called himself God sent for him one day to examine if he was really a fool or an impostor When he was come he told him there had been a person brought to him the other day who counterfeited the fool and said he was a prophet sent by God I ordered him says the Caliph to be put in prison and he was tried condemned and hanged The fool re∣plied you acted right and did then what it was in∣cumbent on one of my faithful servants to do this action of your's pleases me much for I had not be∣stowed the gift of prophecy on that wretch and he acted without any order or mission from me On this the Caliph was ready to worship him for the Turks believe these people to be agitated by the spirit of God This idea of things however is very an∣cient and in a certain degree is found among civi∣lized nations as well as among savages  The nature of the Turkish government is well dis∣played at Salonica by the opposition which despo∣tism experiences from the soldiery The turbulent spirit of the military which always increases when opposed by feeble measures and seizes all the au∣thority of which it can deprive the sovereign power has usurped the government of Salonica Many Pachas have successively been its victims but this opposition to despotism far from destroyings its ef∣fects  only serves to increase its tyranny and the Janissary Aga the officers who command under him and every private Janissary are so many tyrants whom the Porte opposes with caution the Pacha fears and who are the terror of the whole country  The practice usual with the Turks of keeping per∣manent garrisons added to the want of discipline among the troops give them in some sort the pro∣perty of the place at which they are stationed they there exercise rights consecrated by custom which they unite to maintain though entirely opposed to the good order of the state  It is on this principle that the Galiondgis mono∣polize the sale of lambs at Constantinople and force people to buy them The Turkish soldiers in every city enjoy privileges of the same nature and their union gives fresh force to the spirit of fraud which attacks the treasury This knavery prevails over all the coast of the Archipelago where the exportation of corn is the principal article of clandestine commerce  The prohibitions of the Grand Signior so much the more severe as he is himself the monopolizer of this commodity are of no effect and the com∣manders of the galliots employed to prevent the ex∣portation  are the first to promote it for a proper consideration paid them in advance They then fix the station of the galliot and that where the ship shall take in its illicit loading with the time to be allowed for that purpose The country boats bring the corn from the coasts and Grecian and Turkish vessels are employed in the same service nothing of which is noticed by the galliot and covetousness taking ad∣vantage of negligence gives itself up to every kind of fraud  The cutting of wood upon this coast says  Tott  is equally an object of pillage The most powerful individual of the country assumes the right of dis∣posing of this property and the navigator who buys fraudulently and endeavours to better his bargain necessarily encourages this spirit of rapine which an∣nihilates all good order and causes the state which fur∣nishes him with sailors to suffer inconceivable losses  About thirty miles southwest of Salonica lies Janniza anciently Pella which though now an in∣considerable town was formerly the residence of the Macedonian kings and the place which gave birth to  Alexander the Great  Philippi a village having but few houses stands near the ruins of the ancient celebrated town of that  name Its inhabitants consist only of a few poor Greeks yet it is the residence of a Grecian bishop who stiles himself metropolitan of Philippi and Drama and has seven bishops under him The city of Philippi stood on a hill between the rivers Nessus and Strymon on the borders of Thrace to which in its most ancient times it belonged It was at first called Crenides or springtown from the many springs issuing out of the hill on which it stood af∣terwards Dathos or Thasus from the Thasii who built it and lately Philippi from  Philip  of Mace∣don who after having reduced it to ashes rebuilt it with considerable improvements and from that time it belonged to Macedonia Near this town was fought the memorable battle between  Brutus  and  Cas∣sius  on one side and  Augustus  and  Anthony  on the other in which the latter were victorious Under  Julius Caesar  and  Augustus  it was a Roman colony At present it lies waste though still boasting some curious remains of antiquity particularly the ruins of a noble amphitheatre The Apostle  Paul  has written one of his epistles to the Christians of this place  Of all the religions existing says Lady  M W M  that of the Arnounts inhabitants of this province seems the most singular they are natives of Aroun∣tlinch the ancient Macedonia and still retain the courage and hardiness though they have lost the name  of Macedonians being the best militia in the Turkish empire and the only check upon the Janissaries They are foot soldiers and are all armed and cloathed at their own expence they are dressed in clean but coarse white cloth carrying guns of a prodigious length which they run with on their shoulders as if they did not feel the weight of them the leader singing a sort of rude tune not unpleasant and the rest making up the chorus These people living be∣tween Christians and Mahometans and not being skilled in controversy declare that they are utterly unable to judge which religion is best but to be certain of not entirely rejecting the truth they very prudently follow both They go to the mosques on Fridays and to the church on Sundays saying for their ex∣cuse that at the day of judgment they are sure of protection from the true prophet but which that is they are not able to determine in this world I be∣lieve there is no other race of men adds Lady  M  who have so modest an opinion of their own capacity  CHAP XXIII  Albania and Thessaly  ALBANIA or  Arnaut  comprehends the old Gre∣cian  lyricum and Epirus The former was added to Macedonia by  Philip  the word Epirus sig∣nifying the continent It is to Epirus that Italy owed its first apricots whence it accordingly called them  mala Epirotica  This province is bounded by Servia on the North by Macedonia on the East by Achaia on the South and by the Ionian and Adriatic Sea towards the West The inhabitants of this province make very good soldiers but have scarce any notions of learning among them yet they are very skilful in making aqueducts and without any mathematical instruments will measure distances with all the ex∣actness of a geometrician Their method of treating hernia is also remarkable but very rough  The chief towns in this province are Scutari called by the Turks Iscodar a large and fortified town situated upon a lake of the same name It lies about five and twenty miles from the gulph of Venice This city is supposed to have been the re∣sidence  of the ancient kings of Illyricum and it is still the see of a bishop though subject to the Turks  Alessio in Latin  Lyssus  a town on the river Drin not far from where it discharges itself into the Adriatic gulph is famous for being the se∣pulchre of  Scandenberg  who died here about the year He resisted the whole force of the Turkish empire for a great number of years with a very inconsiderable army and is said to have de∣feated them in no less than two and twenty dif∣ferent engagements  Durazzo Epidamnus or Dyrrachium a small port on a peninsula having a pretty good harbour and castle Its first name Epidamnus denotes the corruption of its inhabitants who were so infamous for fraud treachery and voluptuousness that the Romans when they became masters of the town changed its name to that of Dyrrachium whence its present name is derived This is the celebrated port or gulph of Venice to which the Romans sailed who went from the Southeast parts of Italy into Greece It is likewise famous for having been the place of  Cicero  's banishment and affording a retreat to  Pompey  when he fled from  Caesar  at Brun∣dusium  The province of Thessaly now called Janna by the Turks derives its name from king  Thessalus  but was more anciently called Oemonia from Oemon father of  Thessalus  It is bounded by Macedonia on the North the Archipelago on the East by Achaia towards the South and by Epirus towards the West It was some time annexed to Macedonia and at others divided from it The celebrated Mount Pindus se∣parates it from Epirus or a part of present Albania Among its once celebrated twentyfour mountains the most celebrated is Olympus which for its un∣common height is celebrated by the ancient poets and made the residence of the gods The poets have feigned that it reached up to heaven and yet it is not above an English mile in height Pelion and Ossa are likewise among the number of mountains in this province Here also are situated the plains of Phar∣salia and between the mountains Olympus Pelion and Ossa is the delightful valley of Tempe which was so adorned with the gifts of nature and so de∣lightfully watered by the gently winding streams of the Peneus now the Salampria that it was reckoned the garden of the muses This country is certainly fertile to exuberance and seems to exceed all other parts of Greece It produces oranges citrons le∣mons pomegranates grapes of an uncommon sweet∣ness excellent figs and melons almonds olives cot∣ton c and chesnuts take their Latin name from  the town of Castanea in Magnesia whence they were first brought into the colder climates of Europe It was noted anciently for its breed of cattle and horses from which and the extraordinary skill of the Thessalians in horsemanship in all probability the fable of the Centaurs who are said to have been half men and half horses took its rise The modern Thessalonians are a wellmade people The most re∣markable places in this province are  Larissa by the Turks named Genisakar the ca∣pital situated near Mount Olympus on the river Pe∣neus and in a hilly and very delightful part of Thessaly It is a good trading city and the see of a Greek bishop Here the celebrated  Achilles  was born  The situation say  Brown  is very pleasant the city being built on a rising ground on the upper part of which stands a palace of the Grand Signior who kept his court here in in order to be near Candia which was at that time the seat of war and likewise for the convenience of hawking and hunting the country about Larissa being well adapted for those recreations Notwithstanding the extreme height of Mount Olympus in the imagination of the poets it seems according to the above writer that no snow was to be seen on its summit in the month  of September whilst on the Alpine Pyrenean and Carpathian mountains it lies all the year  Farsa said to be the ancient Pharsalus and famous for the battle fought near this city between  Caesar  and  Pompey  lies thirty miles to the South of Larissa though  Cluverius  places these celebrated plains more to the westward  Janna from whence this country takes its present name is a wellbuilt town about forty miles to the north of Lepanto  Tornoso east of the above is a spacious pleasant city in which are eighteen Greek churches and three Turkish mosques The present bishop is under the archbishop of Larissa  Armiro or Etraria is supposed to have been the port from whence the Argonauts set sail  With respect to the persons of the inhabitants of this province  Brown  relates that the men are tall and well proportioned with black hair and eyes and rubicond complexions the women likewise are cele∣brated for their beauty The Macedonians who in∣habit the mountains to the northward are much more rough and weatherbeaten in their appearance  whilst the natives of the Morea to the southward have swarthy complexions compared with theirs so that this province whether we consider the sweetness and temperature of the air the fertility of the soil the variety of pleasing landscapes or the beauty of the inhabitants seems preferable in these respects to every other part of Greece and justly to have me∣rited the character the ancients gave of it  CHAP XXIV  Livadia  THE province of Livadia which comprises an∣cient Greece properly so called and to which belonged the little kingdoms of Acarania Aetolia Locris Phocis Doris Boeotia Megara and Attica is bounded by Thessaly on the North by the Archi∣pelago or Aegean Sea towards the East by the Morea or Peloponnesus on the South and by the Ionian Sea towards the West The principal rivers in this country which is for the most part mountain∣ous are the Sionapro anciently called the Achelous separating the Arcaranians from the Aetolians the Ce∣phisus  and the Ismenus which latter river discharges itself into the Archipelago  The most remarkable places in this province are  Athens according to  Busching  now called Setines This ancient capital of Attica is situated near the gulph of Engia about forty miles to the East of the isthmus of Corinth and about the same distance from Cape Raphaei the most eastern part of Livadia It stands in the center of a large and beautiful plain making up for what it may be deficient in fertility by the healthiness of its situation This city was at first called Cecropia rom  Cecrops  its founder but af∣terwards known by the name of Athens Exclusive of its power grandeur and opulence it was highly celebrated for the incorruptible fidelity of its citi∣zens and for being the nursery of the most eminent philosophers statesmen and orators for its multitude likewise of great commanders no city has ever equalled it It was governed at first by kings then by archons but afterwards fell successively under the power of the Persians Macedonians and Romans In latter times it came under the dominion of the Turks from whom it was taken by the Venetians In the year the Turks again took it In the Venetians recovered it But in the last wars be∣tween these two powers the Turks again got pos∣session  of it These many vicissitudes have greatly diminished its splendor but even in its present state are many remains of its ancient grandeur which give ocular demonstration of the great and astonish∣ing perfection of the Athenians in sculpture and architecture The inhabitants at this time are reckoned about ten thousand threeparts of whom are Christians and have a great number of churches and places of worship The Turks also have here five mosques  Among the many great and small remains of an∣cient and stately edifices those more particularly worthy of notice says  Busching  are the temple of Jupiter Olympias and above all the  Parthenian  or magnificent temple of  Minerva  now converted into a Turkish mosque and accounted the finest piece of antiquity in the world In the last Venetian war this building suffered very much by the cannon The two rivers Ilyssus and Eridanus that water the plain in which Athens now stands are very small the former being diverted into several canals for wa∣tering the olive plantations and the latter lost in the many branches through which it is conveyed over the country  Athens had anciently three ports of which Pha∣lerum and Munichia lay to the eastward and Piraeus  to the west of a small cape The latter being an en∣closed spacious harbour with a narrow entrance is still much resorted to and by the Greeks called  Porto Drago  but by the Italians  Porto Leone  from a pillar there in memory of a lion which was carried from hence to Venice  The city was not more than two miles and a half from the sea by Phalerum but perhaps the distance is increased  Phalerum was said to have been named from  Pha∣lerus  a companion of  Jason  in the Argonautic expe∣dition  Theseus  sailed from it for Crete and  Me∣nestheus  his successor for Troy and it continued to be the haven of Athens to the time of  Themistocles  It is a small port of a circular form the entrance narrow the bottom of a clear fine sand visible through the transparent water The farm of  Aristides  and his monument which was erected at the public expence were by this port Munychia is of a dif∣ferent form or oval and more considerable the mouth also narrow  The traveller accustomed to deep ports and bulky shipping may view Phalerum with some surprize but Argo is said to have been carried on the shoulders of the crew the vessels at the siege of Troy were  drawn up on the shore as a bulwark before the camp and the mighty fleet of  Xerxes  consisted chiefly of light barks and gallies Phalerum though a bason shallow and not large may perhaps even now be capable of receiving an armament like that of  Me∣nestheus  though it consisted of fifty ships  The capital port was that called Piraeus The en∣trance of this is narrow and formed by two rocky points Within were three stations for shipping Kanthanu so named from a hero Aphrodisium from a temple of  Venus  and Zea the resort of vessels laden with grain The wall was begun by  Themistocles  and completed as the importance of the place de∣served This whole fortification was of hewn stone without cement or other materials except lead and iron which were used to hold together the exterior ranges or facings It was so wide that loaded carts could pass on it in different directions and it was forty cubits high which was half what he had de∣signed The bones of this great man when trans∣ported from Magnesia by the  Moeander  were with propriety deposited in the Piraeus near the biggest port called Kantharus by which were the arsenals "When you are got within the elbow says  Pausanias  which projects from the promontory of Alcimus where the water is smooth you are near the scite of  his tomb" It was in shape like an altar or round and on a large basement  The Piraeus as Athens flourished became the common emporium of Greece  Hippodamus  an architect celebrated besides other monuments of his genius as the inventor of many improvements in housebuilding was employed to lay out the ground Five porticos which uniting formed the long por∣tico were erected by the ports Here was an Agora or marketplace and farther from the sea another called Hippodamia By the vessels were dwellings for the mariners A theatre was opened temples were raised and the Piraeus which surpassed the city in utility began to equal it in dignity The cavities and windings of Munychia were filled with houses and the whole settlement comprehending Phalerum and the ports of Piraeus with the arsenals the storehouses and the famous armoury of which  Philo  was the architect and the sheds for three hundred and afterwards four hundred triremes resemble the city of Rhodes which had been planned by the same  Hippo∣damus  It was the design of  Themistocles  to annex the Pi∣raeus to the city by long walls The side descend∣ing to Phalerum was begun  Pericles  completed it and erected the opposite wall  The Piraeus was reduced with great difficulty by  Sylla  who demolished the walls and set fire to the ar∣moury and arsenals In the second century besides houses for triremes the temple of  Jupiter  and  Minerva  with their images in brass were erected and a temple of  Venus  a portico and the tomb of  Themistocles  The port of the Piraeus has been named Porto Leone from the marble lion seen in the chart and also Porto Draco The lion has been described as a piece of admirable sculpture ten feet high and as reposing on its hinder parts Near Athens was another lion posture couchant probably its compa∣nion Both these were removed to Venice by the famous General  Morisini  and are to be seen there before the arsenal  At the mouth of the port are two ruined piers A few vessels mostly small craft frequent it Some low land at the head seems an encroachment on the water The buildings are a mean custom house with a few sheds and by the shore on the east side a warehouse belonging to the French and a Greek monastery dedicated to  S Spiridion  It was the boast of the early Athenians says  Chandler  that their origin was from the land which they inhabited and their antiquity coequal with the  sun The reputed founder of their city was  Cecrops  who uniting a body of the natives then living dis∣persed and in caves settled on the rock of the Acropolis He was there secure from inundation a calamity much dreaded after the deluge which had h  pp  ned one hundred and ninety years before The hill was nearly in the center of his little territory rising majestically in the middle of the plain as if designed by nature for the seat of government The town and its domain was called Cecropia but the name of the former was afterwards changed in ho∣nour of  Minerva  A wandering people called Pe∣lasgi were first employed to level the summit of the rock and to encompass it with a wall which they completed except on the south where the deficiency was supplied by trunks of olive trees and pallisadoes The entrance was by nine gates Afterwards  Cimon  son of  Miltiades  erected the wall on the south side with the spoil he had taken in the Persian war  The tyranny of  Pisistratus  was established by his getting possession of the Acropolis or citadel from which he could command and overawe the town be∣low His son  Hippias  was expelled and then fol∣lowed the invasion by  Darius  and the battle of Ma∣rathon Thirtythree years after this Athens was taken and set on fire by  Xerxes  and in the next year by his general  Mardonius  but on the victories  of Plataea and Salamis it emerged from ruin to su∣perior lustre and extended dominion The Pelo∣ponnesian war then ensued the long walls were de∣molished and it was even proposed to raze the city and lay waste the plain  The victory obtained over the Thebans at Man∣tinea left Athens at leisure to indulge in elegant dis∣sipation A poet was preferred to a general and vast sums were expended on plays and public spectacles At this period  Philip  of Macedon was aspiring to the empire of Greece and Asia  Alexander  his son sa∣crificed a hecatomb to  Minerva  at Athens and forti∣fied the Piraeus to keep the city in subjection On his death the Athenians revolted but were defeated by  Antipater  who garrisoned Munychia They rebelled again but the garrigarchy were re instated  Deme∣trius  the Phalerean who was made governor beau∣tified the city and they erected to him three hundred and sixty statues which on his expulsion they de∣molished except one in the Acropolis  Demetrius Poliorcetes  reduced the garrison and restored demo∣cracy when they deified him and lodged him in the back part of the Parthenon as a guest to be enter∣tained by their  Minerva  Philip  son of  Demetrius  encamping near the city and laying the territory waste the Athenians were re∣duced  to solicit protection from the Romans and to receive a garrison which remained till the war with  Mithridates  when the tyrant  Aristion  made them re∣volt  Archelaus  the Athenian general unable to withstand the Roman fury retreated into the Piraeus and Munichia  Sylla  burned both places and de∣feated the city and suburbs not sparing even the se∣pulchres  This city now became dependent more or less on the different Roman emperors till the time of  Alaric  king of the Goths who under the emperors  Arca∣dius  and  Honorius  overran Greece and Italy sack∣ing pillaging and destroying Then the Pelopon∣nesian towns were overturned Arcadia and Lacede∣mon were laid waste the two seas by the isthmus were burnished with the flames of Corinth and the Athenian matrons were dragged in chains by barba∣rians The invaluable treasures of antiquity it is related were removed the stately and magnificent structures converted into piles of ruins and Athens was stripped of every thing splendid or remarkable  Synesius  a writer of that age compares the city to a victim the body of which had been consumed and the hide only remained  After this even Athens became an unimportant place and as obscure as it had once been famous  MAP of GREECE c  map of Greece  A chasm of near seven hundred years ensues in its history except that about the year it furnished  Roger  the first king of Sicily with a number of ar∣tificers whom he settled at Palermo where they in∣troduced the culture of silk which thus passed into Sicily  Athens as it were reemerges a little from obli∣vion in the thirteenth century till towards the latter end of the fifteenth by being made the seat of war between the Greek and Turkish emperors it sunk again In it was taken by the Venetians  It is remarkable that after this conquest Athens was again in a manner forgotten So lately as about the middle of the sixteenth century the city was commonly believed to have been utterly de∣stroyed and not to exist except a few huts of poor fishermen  Crusius  a learned and inquisitive German procured more authentic information from his Greek correspondents residing in Turkey which he pub∣lished in to awaken curiosity and to promote further discoveries One of these letters is from a native of Nauplia a town near Argos in the Morea The writer says he had been often at Athens and that it still contained things worthy to be seen some of which he enumerates and then subjoins "but  why do I dwell on this place It is as the skin of an animal which has been long dead"  The walls of Athens when the city was in its pros∣perity with the Piraeus were twentyfour miles in cir∣cumference In its present state says the above writer this city is certainly by no means inconsider∣able either in extent or in number of inhabitants It is placed by geographers in fiftythree degrees of longitude its latitude was found by Mr  Vernon  an English traveller to be thirtyeight degrees and five minutes It enjoys a fine temperature and a serene sky The air is clear and wholesome though not so delicately soft as in Ionia The town stands be∣neath the Acropolis or citadel not encompassing the rock as formerly but spreading into the plain Corsairs infesting it the avenues were secured and in the gates were regularly shut after sunset It is now open again but several of the gateways re∣main and a guard of Turks patrole at midnight  The houses in this city are mostly mean and strag∣gling many with large areas or courts before them In the lanes the high walls on each side which are commonly whitewashed strongly reflect the heat of the sun The streets are very irregular and anciently were neither uniform nor handsome They have water conveyed in channels from mount  Hymettus and in the Bazar or marketplace is a large fountain The Turks have several mosques and public baths The Greeks have convents for men and women with many churches in which ser∣vice is regularly performed and besides these they have numerous oratories or chapels some in ruins or consisting of bare walls frequented only on the anniversaries of the saints to whom they are dedi∣cated A portrait of the owner on a board is placed in them on that occasion and removed when the solemnity of the day is over  Besides the more stable antiquities of which we shall give an account in the sequel many detached pieces are found in the town by the fountains in the streets the walls the houses and churches Among these are fragments of sculpture a marble chair or two which probably belonged to the Gymnasia or theatres a sundial at the catholicon or cathedral inscribed with the name of the maker and at the archiepiscopal house close by a very curious vessel of marble used as a cistern to receive water but once serving it is likely as a public standard or measure Many columns occur with some maimed statues and pedestals several with inscriptions and almost buried in earth A custom has prevailed as at Chios of fixing in the wall over the gateways and doors of the houses carved stones most of which  exhibit the funereal supper In the courts of the houses lie many round pillars once placed on the graves of the Athenians and a great number are still to be seen applied to the same use in the Turkish burying grounds before the Acropolis These ge∣nerally have concise inscriptions containing the name of the person and of the town and tribe to which the deceased belonged  Demetrius  the Phalerean who en∣deavoured to restrain sepulchral luxury enacted that no person should have more than one and that the height should not exceed three cubits Another spe∣cies which resembles our modern headstones is sometimes adorned with sculpture and has an epitaph in verse We saw a few mutilated Hermae There were busts on long quadrangular bases the heads frequently of brass invented by the Athenians At first they were made to represent only  Hermes  or  Mer∣cury  and designed as guardians of the sepulchres in which they were lodged but afterwards the houses streets and porticos of Athens were adorned with them and rendered venerable by a multitude of portraits of illustrious men and women of heroes and of gods and it is related  Hipparchus  son of  Pisistratus  erected them in smaller towns and by the roadside inscribed with moral apothegms in elegiac verse thus making them vehicles of instruction  The Acropolis or citadel which was the city of Cecrops is still a fortress with a thick irregular wall standing on the brink of precipices and enclosing a large area about twice as long as broad Some por∣tions of the ancient wall may be discovered on the outside particularly at the two extreme angles and in many places it is patched with pieces of columns and with marbles taken from the ruins The garri∣son consists of a few Turks who reside there with their families and are called by the Greeks  Castriani  or soldiers of the castle These hollow nightly from their station above the town to approve their vigi∣lance Their houses overlook the city plain and gulph but the situation is as airy as pleasant though attended with so many inconveniences that those who are able and have the option prefer living below when not on duty The rock is lofty abrupt and in∣accessible except the front which is towards Piraeus and on that quarter is a mountainous ridge within cannonshot It is destitute of water fit for drinking and supplies are daily carried up in earthen jars on horses and asses from one of the conduits in the town  The Acropolis furnished a very ample field to the ancient virtuosi It was filled with monuments of Athenian glory and exhibited an amazing display of beauty opulence and art each contending as it  were for the superiority It appeared as one entire offering to the deity surpassing in excellence and astonishing in magnificence  Heliodorus  named  Pe∣riegetes  the guide had employed on it fifteen books The curiosities of various kinds with the pictures statues and pieces of sculpture were so many and so remarkable as to supply  Polemo Periegetes  with matter for four volumes and  Strabo  affirms that as many would be required in treating of other portions of Athens and Attica In particular the number of statues was prodigious  Tiberius Nero  who was fond of images plundered the Acropolis as well as Del∣phi and Olympia yet Athens and each of these places had not fewer remaining in the time of  Pliny  Even  Pausanias  seems here to be distressed by the multiplicity of his subject But this banquet as it were of the understanding has long since been with∣drawn and is now become like the tale of a vision The spectator views with concern the marble ruins intermixed with mean flatroofed cottages and extant amid rubbish the sad memorials of a nobler people which however as visible from the sea▪ should have introduced modern Athens to more early notice They who reported it was only a small village must have beheld the Acropolis through the wrong end of their telescopes  When we consider the long series of years which has elapsed and the variety of fortune which Athens has undergone we may wonder that any portions of the old city has escaped and that the scite still fur∣nishes an ample fund of curious entertainment  Atticus  is represented by  Cicero  as receiving more pleasure from the recollection of the eminent men it had produced than from the stately edifices and works of art with which it then abounded  It was the fortune of Athens whilst flourishing in glory dominions and revenue to produce  Pericles  a man as distinguished by the vastness of his ideas as by the correctness of his taste and as eloquent as splendid His enemies declaiming against his temples and images and comparing the city with its gilding and painting to a vain woman hung with jewels he took occasion to shew it was wisdom to convert the prosperity of a state sufficiently prepared for war into a perpetual ornament by public works which ex∣cited every liberal art moved every hand and dis∣pensed plenty to the labourer and artificer to the mariner and merchant the whole city being at once employed maintained and beautified by itself "Think ye said he it is much I have expended Some an∣swered very much Be mine then he replied the  whole burthen and mine the honour of inscribing the edifices raised for you"  The architects employed by  Pericles  were pos∣sessed of consummate skill in their profession and  Phidias  was his overseer The artificers in the va∣rious branches were emulous to excel the materials by their workmanship To grandeur of proportion were added inimitable form and grace The vigour of one administration accomplished what appeared to require the united efforts of many yet each fabric was as mature in perfection as if it had been long finishing  Plutarch  affirms that in his time the struc∣tures of  Pericles  alone demonstrated the relations of the ancient power and wealth of Greece not to be romantic In their character was an excellence pe∣culiar and unparalleled Even then they retained all their original beauty A certain frankness bloomed upon them and preserved their fame uninjured as if they possessed a neverfading spirit and had a soul invincible by age The remains of some of these edifices still extant in the Acropolis cannot be be∣held without admiration  The Acropolis has now as formerly only one en∣trance which fronts the Piraeus The ascent is by traverses and rude fortifications furnished with can∣non but without carriages and neglected By the  second gate is the station of the guard who sits crosslegged under cover much at his ease smoaking his pipe or drinking coffee with his companions about him in like attitudes Over this gateway is an in∣scription in large characters on a stone turned upside down and black from the fires made below It re∣cords the present of a pair of gates  Farther up are the ruins of the propylea an edi∣fice which graces the entrance into the citadel This was one of the structures of  Pericles  It was com∣pleted in five years at the expence of two thousand talents It was of marble of the Doric order and had five doors to afford an easy passage to the mul∣titude which resorted on business or devotion to the Acropolis  While this fabric was building the architect whose activity equalled his skill was hurt by a fall and the physicians despaired of his life but  Minerva  who was propitious to the undertaking appeared it was said to  Pericles  and prescribed a remedy by which he was speedily and easily cured It was a plant or herb growing round about the Acropolis and called afterwards Parthenium  The right wing of the propylea was a temple of victory On the left and fronting the temple of  victory was a building decorated with paintings by  Polygnotus  of which an account is given by  Pausa∣nias  This edifice as well as the temple was of the Doric order the columns fluted and without bases Both contributed alike to the uniformity and gran∣deur of the design and the whole fabric when fi∣nished was deemed equally magnificent and orna∣mental The interval between  Pericles  and  Pausa∣nias  consists of several centuries The propylea re∣mained entire in the time of this topographer and continued nearly so to a much later period It had then a roof of white marble which was unsurpassed either in the size of the stones or in the beauty of their arrangement and before each wing was an equestrian statue  The propylea or vestibules have ceased to be the entrance of the Acropolis The passage which was between the columns is walled up almost to their capital and above is a battery of cannon  The temple of victory standing on an abrupt rock has the back and one side unincumbered with the modern ramparts The columns in the front be∣ing walled up you enter it by a breach in the side within the propylea or vestibules It was used by the Turks as a magazine for powder until about the year when a sudden explosion occasioned by  lightning carried away the roof with a house erected on it belonging to the officer who commanded in the Acropolis whose whole family except a girl pe∣rished and it is now abandoned to ruins  The building opposite to the temple has served as a foundation for a square and lofty tower of ordi∣nary masonry The columns of the front of this building are likewise walled up and the entrance is by a low iron gate in the side It is now used as a place of confinement for delinquents but in was a powder magazine In the wall of a rampart near it are some pieces of exquisite sculpture re∣presenting the Athenians fighting with the Amazons In the second century when  Pausanias  lived much of the painting was impaired by age but some re∣mained and the subjects were chiefly taken from the Trojan story  Pausanias  mentions with enthusiasm the astonishing whiteness of the marble employed in building the propylea and the immense size of the pieces some of which were two and twenty feet in length The height of the five doorways was the double of their breadth The central one was twelve feet seven inches wide the two next eight feet eight inches and the two smallest four feet four inches The por∣tico to which the five doorways belonged consisted  of a large square room roofed with slabs of marble which were laid on two great marble beams and sus∣tained by four beautiful columns The roof of the propylea after standing above two thousand years was probably destroyed with all the pediments by the Venetians in when they battered the castle in front firing redhot bullets and took it but were compelled to resign it to the Turks in the following year The exterior walls and in particular a side of the temple of victory retain many marks of their violence  The chief ornament of the Acropolis was the par∣thenon or great temple of  Minerva  a most superb and magnificent fabric The Persians had burned the edifice which before occupied the scite and was called hecatompedon from its being an hundred feet square The zeal of  Pericles  and of all the Athe∣nians was exerted in providing a far more ample and glorious residence for their favourite goddess The architects were  Callicrates  and  Ictinus  and a trea∣tise on the building was written by the latter and  Carpion  The statue of  Minerva  made for this temple by  Phidias  was of ivory thirtynine feet high It was decked with pure gold to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds so disposed by the ad∣vice  of  Pericles  as to be taken off and weighed if required The goddess was represented standing with her vestment reaching to her feet Her helmet had a sphinx for the crest and on the side were grif∣fins The head of  Medusa  was her breastplate In one hand she held her spear and in the other sup∣ported an image of victory about four cubits high The battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae were carved on her sandals and on her shield which lay at her feet the war of the gods and giants and the battle of the Athenians and Amazons By her spear was a serpent in allusion to the story of Ericthonius and on the pedestal the birth of Pandora The sphinx the victory and the serpent were accounted emi∣nently wonderful This image was placed in the tem∣ple in the first year of the eightyseventh Olympiad in which the Peloponnesian war began The gold was stripped off by the tyrant  Lacharez  when  Deme∣trius Poliorcetes  compelled him to fly  It was observed of  Phidias  that as a statuary he excelled in forming gods more than men a short en∣comium containing the subject of a panegyric The  Minerva  of Athens with a statue he made afterwards of  Jupiter  at Olympia raised him far above com∣petition in ivory Such an artist deserved to be ge∣nerously treated but  Phidias  had enemies as well as his patron He had inserted in the shield of  Mi∣nerva  a beautiful figure of  Pericles  without his knowledge fighting with an amazon the face partly concealed a hand with a spear extended before it seeming designed to prevent the likeness from being perceived Much envy and obloquy followed when that with our image was detected  Phidias  was re∣presented as an old man and bald but with a pon∣derous stone uplifted in his hands and this figure ce∣menting as it were the whole work could not be re∣moved without its falling in pieces He was accused of having embezzled some ivory by charging more for the scales of the serpent than had been consumed He fled to Elis and was killed by the people to secure their  Jupiter  from a rival  Minerva  preserved her station in the Acropolis during all the revolutions of the Athenian govern∣ment till the extirpation of gentilism by  Alaric  and his Goths The potent and revered idol of  Minerva  then it is likely submitted to the common plunderer of the Grecian cities who levelled all their images without distinction alike regardless whether they were heaven descended or the works of  Phidias  The Parthenon remained entire for many ages after it was deprived of the goddess The Christians con∣verted it into a church and the Mahometans into a mosque It is mentioned in the letters of  Crusius  and miscalled the  Pantheon  and the temple of  the un∣known god  The Venetians under  Koningsmark  when they besieged the Acropolis in threw a bomb which demolished the roof and setting fire to some powder did much damage to the fabric The floor which is indented still witnesses the place of its fall This was the sad forerunner of farther destruction the Turks breaking the stones and applying them to the building of a new mosque which stands within the ruin or to the repairing of their houses and the walls of the fortress The vast pile of ponderous materials which lay ready is greatly diminished and the whole structure will gradually be consumed and disappear  The temple of  Minerva  in was as  Wheeler  and  Spon  assert the finest mosque in the world with∣out comparison The Greeks had adapted this fabric to their ceremonial by constructing at one end a semicircular recess for the holy tables with a win∣dow for before it was enlightened only by the door obscurity being preferred under the heathen ritual except on festivals when it yielded to splendid illu∣minations In the wall beneath the window were inserted two pieces of the stone called Phengites a a species of marble discovered in Cappadocia in the time of  Nero  and so transparent that he erected with it a temple to Fortune which was luminous  within when the door was shut These pieces were perforated and the light which entered was tinged with a reddish or yellowish hue The picture of the Panagia or  Virgin Mary  in  Mosaic  on the ceiling of the recess remained with two jasper columns belonging to the skreen and within a canopy sup∣ported by four pillars of porphyry under which the table had been placed and behind it beneath the window a marble chair for the archbishop and also a pulpit standing on four small pillars in the middle aisle The Turks had whitewashed the walls to ob∣literate the portraits of saints and other paintings with which the Greeks decorate their places of wor∣ship and had erected a pulpit on their right hand for their Iman or reader  The fabric which is built of most beautiful white marble is in the form of a parallellogram extending from East to West Its length is two hundred and twentyone feet and the breadth ninetyfour The colonades which surround the building are fortysix in number Their diameter is five feet eight inches and their height thirtytwo The distance between each column is seven feet four inches Eight columns are in front as many behind and fifteen on each side to which if the four corner ones be added there are seventeen on each side they are of the  ARIADNE'S DANCE and the TEMPLE of MINERVA  Doric order fluted and without bases and adorned with admirable sculpture  It is not easy to conceive a more striking object than the Parthenon though now a mere ruin The columns within the naos have all been removed but on the floor may be seen the circles which directed the work∣men in placing them The recess erected by the Christians is demolished and from the rubbish of the ceiling the Turkish boys collect bits of the Mosaic of different colours which composed the picture This substance has been found susceptible of a polish and is set in buckles On the walls are some traces of the paintings  The travellers to whom we are indebted for an ac∣count of the mosque have likewise given a descrip∣tion of the sculpture then remaining in the front In the middle of the pediment was seen a bearded  Ju∣piter  with a majestic countenance standing and naked the right arm broken The thunderbolt it has been supposed was placed in that hand and the eagle between his feet On his right was a figure it was conjectured of victory clothed to the midleg the head and arms gone This was leaning on the horses of a car in which  Minerva  sat young and unarmed her headdress instead of a helmet re∣sembling that of  Venus  The generous ardour and  lively spirit visible in this pair of celestial steeds was such as bespoke the hand of a master bold and deli∣cate of a  Phidias  or  Praxiteles  Behind  Minerva  was a female figure without a head sitting with an infant in her lap On the left side of  Jupiter  were five or six other trunks to complete the assembly of deities into which he received her These figures were all wonderfully carved and appeared as big as life The rest of the statues are defaced removed or fallen In the other pediment is a head or two of seahorses finely executed with some mutilated figures  It is to be regretted that so much admirable sculp∣ture as is still extant about this fabric should be all likely to perish as it were immaturely from igno∣rant  empt and brutal violence Numerous carved stones have disappeared and many lying in the ruinous heaps moved our indignation at the barbarism daily exercised in defacing them Besides the two pediments all the metopes were decorated with large figures in  alto relievo  several of which are almost entire These are exceedingly striking espe∣cially when viewed with a due proportion of light and shade Their subject is the same as was chosen for the sandals of  Minerva  or the battle of the Cen∣taurs and Lapithae On the freeze of the cell was carved in  basso relievo  the solemnity of a sacrifice to  Minerva  and of this one hundred and seventy feet are standing the greater part in good preservation containing a procession on horseback On two stones which have fallen are oxen led as victims On another fourteen feet long are the virgins called Canephori which assisted at the rites bearing the sacred canisters on their heads and in their hands each a taper with other figures one a venerable person with a beard reading in a large volume which is partly supported by a boy We purchased two fine fragments of the freeze which we found in∣serted over doorways in the town and were pre∣sented with a beautiful trunk which had fallen from the metopes and lay neglected in the garden of a Turk  On the north side of the Parthenon is a cluster of ruins containing the erectheum and the temple of  Pandrosos  daughter of  Cecrops  Neptune  and  Minerva  once rival deities were joint and amicable tenants of the erectheum The building was double a partitionwall dividing it which fronted different ways One was the temple of  Neptunus Erectheus  the other of  Minerva Polias  The ruin of the erectheum is of white marble the architectural ornaments of very exquisite work∣manship  and uncommonly curious The columns of the front of the temple of  Neptune  are standing with the architrave and also the skreen and portico of  Minerva Polias  with a portion of the cell retain∣ing traces of the partitionwall The order is Ionic An edifice revered by ancient Attica as holy in the highest degree was in the dwelling of a Turkish family and is now deserted and neglected but many ponderous stones and much rubbish must be removed before the well and trident would appear By the portico is a battery commanding the town from which the Turks fire to give notice of the com∣mencement of Ramazan or of their Lent and of Bairam or the holydays and on other public occasions  The Pandroseum is a small but very particular building of which no satisfactory idea can be com∣municated by description The entablature is sup∣ported by women called Caryatides Their story is thus related The Greeks victorious in the Per∣sian war jointly destroyed Carya a city of Pelo∣ponnesus which had favoured the common enemy They cut off the males and carried into captivity the women whom they compelled to retain their former dress and ornaments though in a state of servitude The architects of those times to per∣petuate the memory of their punishment represented  them as in this instance each with a burthen on her head one hand uplifted to it and the other hang∣ing down by the side The images were in number six all looking towards the Parthenon The four in front with that next to the Propylea remain but mutilated and their faces besmeared with paint The soil is risen almost to the top of the basement on which they are placed This temple was open or latticed between the statues and in it also was a stunted olivetree with an altar of  Jupiter Herceus  standing under it The Propylea are nearly in a line with the space dividing it from the Parthenon which disposition besides its other effects occasioned the front and flank of the latter edifice to be seen at once by them who approached it from the entrance of the Acropolis  Besides the statue of  Minerva Polias  which was of olive and that in the Parthenon the Acropolis possessed a third which was of brass and so tall that the point of the spear and the crest of the hel∣met were visible from Sunium It was an offering made with a tenth of the spoils taken at Marathon and dedicated to the goddess The artist was  Phidias  It remained to the time of  Arcadius  and  Honorius  and  Minerva  it was said appeared to  Alaric  as re∣presented in this image There were likewise some images of her which escaped the
