 LIFE  OR THE ADVENTURES OF WILLIAM RAMBLE ESQ  By the Author of MODERN TIMES OR THE ADVENTURES OF GABRIEL OUTCAST  IN THREE VOLUMES VOL II  LONDON Printed for Dr TRUSLER and sold at the LITERARY PRESS No WARDOURSTREET SOHO    THE ADVENTURES OF WILL RAMBLE ESQ  CHAP XV  RATTLE called on his friend Ramble and took him with him to the Shakespeare the members had assembled some time they consisted of a motley group of all classes all complexions and all nations The chair was filled with old Noisy a man of some consequence  in the opinion of the society and more so in his own he was one who had long been the bellweather of the flock A man with a sullen countenance and hanging eyebrows that prevented his eyes declaring the mischief brooding in his heart He hated Kings and King'smen but it was only because he was not on the list himself This man had been haranguing the company for near an hour and an half and had not done yet He was when Ramble entered on the subject of republicanism  Monarchy said he could only be the invention of tyrants who wished to enslave the people and make them  subservient to their own purposes If kings had no such wish what were they Idols puppets to whose office was annexed a troublesome and ridiculousnay I may call it a  blasphemous  ceremony assuming that homage that should be paid only to the Deity an office to which the good sense of the people is sacrificed and a million of their money yearly Why are we gentlemen to work hardWhy is the honest shoemaker the taylor the buttonmaker the turner and a thousand other respectable tradesmen to deprive their wives and children of comfort and necessaries to cloath amuse and  pamper a gilded puppet 'Tis true I have no wife nor child at least such as I would call so but nevertheless I feel for you allGod knows my heartI speak not from private interest Whether we have a king or no king it is all the same to me I have no money that I care a fig for What I win to day I lose tomorrow and what I may lose tomorrow I may win the day after To a single man life's a lottery He is the child of fortune The world contributes to support me One feeds me another cloathes me and if I cannot pay them in cash I will in breath No man shall stop may mouth Words are the only things I have to give and I will  never spare them If they choak my utterance above I will pour them forth below A ft for them all I care not who leaves me or who keeps with me I can  stand  without support ask mother A she'll vouch for me I have no wife or children but you it is for you and you only that I have struggled through life and for you I will struggle whilst I have lungs and spiritsIn short gentlemen you are always sure of  me  I am a republican all over  will oppose depotism  vi et armis  and fight for your interest  pedibusque manibusque  Till I am in place  Mr President I shall nae  think that administration consults its own interest they ought to ha their freends aboot them  says Saunders Macpherson a brawny Scotchman who sat impatiently waiting for an opportunity of venting his sarcasms  It would be happy for his maajesty if au his freends were as muckle in his interest as Saunders Macpherson who has travelled in his kirtle far o'er the Highlands in defence of prerogative An ye had any discernment you would ken the blessings of the present establishment Before our good Jamie sat on the throne of this country ye were aw a parcel of raggamuffins like the  Sans Culottes  at Paris running your heeds against each other in search of a scurvey lassie ye call leeberty who has played you monie a shrewd trick She shewed you a bonny visage to mack you in loov wi her and then turned her ragged breech upon you It was oor Jamie that taught you to be weese he took the dirk out of your hands that you might not cut your fingers and let you ken that happiness was in aw your reach Has not he and his successors given sic encouragement to trade and commerce that you may if you please indulge your luxuries nay your very veeces  Ha they not put you in the way to get sic penty of pouns that you may throw them awa and be nae the poorer for what you lack in cash you find in credit There's yon bonny chield Johnny Latitat that will tell you the same he will tell you that he has mair pouns than he kens what to do wi Where then in the name of St Andrew is there cause of grumbling Why winna you be content Money appears of so little value in the present happy times that each man seems to ha mair of it than he wishes or he winna part wi it so reedily We are aw sensible of the condescension of oor  governmentAre not the king's meenisters ready for a little of this stuff which is of nae value and which we seem to set nae store by to gee us permeession to use oor aine jades to employ our aine servants to breathe the fresh air and enjoy the leeght of the day And that we may nae want a quantity of money to pay for sic indulgencies what can be maer considerate than to leemit our amusements and keep us frae spending our time idly That gued hearted man Jamie departed frae his aine fertile country to take up his residence in South Britain where your finest prospects without a mountain are nae  mair to be compared with the prospects of the North than a lassie with fine eyne and good complexion but without and nose in her face is to ane who has every striking feature You may tell us that he was glad to get into the South that he might taste your peaches and your nectarines and your other fine fruits but in gued troth where would ha been sic fruits but for the gardeners of North Britain who are as far preferable to the fruits as the creator is to the created Every country has its boast England may have a good cleemet for peaches and nectarines it may excel in arts as France  does in wine Arabia in horses and Spain in wool But I declare by St Andrew no country can produce better men and women than Scotland they are oor staple commodity they are au men of learning and we export a great number to enrich other countries Even London is the better for them and you ought to be thankful that our Jamie led the way Had he been weese and steed in his aine country you would now ha been as savage as your ancestors but he removed himsel here made London the capital of Scotland and held his court at St James's which is little better than an hospital when  he might have figured away with more splendor and comfort in Holyrood house in Edinburgh so that do ye ken maester president Jamie coming to London brought au our nobeelity and gentry here too and here they are spending their estates among an ungrateful rabble What would England ha been but for the unionShe has grown wealthy she has acquired a million and a half of freends that would otherwise ha been her enemies She has acquired security There is no door open now by which the French can penetrate your country They dare as soon be dn'd as attempt  to invade Scotland so that if you can but defend your own coasts you may bid the de'el kiss your weem Yet ye are au grumbling ye are nae grateful nor contented but ye want to pull down your monarch and become as savage as your forefathers In guede troth Mr President we are under great obligation to gevernment and ought  to be very proud os our king  That dunderhead  Mr Chairman that rails at all measures that do not accord with his inclinations  says Neddy Turncoat a stout tall man who had once been of another way of thinking than when he rose up to speak and  who then took the part of opposition because he thought opposition was on the eve of getting into place  That dunderhead says he discovers very little sagacity and can have no retrospect to the excellence of the British constitution He is a mere creature of his own fancy and illumined only by the glare of a deceitful meteor the  ignis fatuus  of a shallow mind that leads him into bottomless bogs and over dreadful precipices The man who lifts his hand against the present government reminds me of the giant in Mother Goose's Tales who in the intemperence of his wrath tore up a vast oak by the roots and brandished it  in his hand crying Fee fau fum I smell the blood of an Englishman I am a plain man Mr Chairman and love to use plain word and when I speak of the constitution of this country I speak the language of a plain citizen not versed in oratory or bred in the school of rhetorick When I speak of the three estates of the realm the King the Lords and the Common I approach the Commons with respect the Lords with deference and the King with awe I consider each as a check upon the other and each incapable of doing any harm but collectively it is like the  tria in uno  where the whole combined is perfect and where one  power cannot act but in union with the other two All must be wrong or each must be right Whoever then shall gainsay this trinity is a blasphemer of the state an incendiary a seditious fellow running about with a torch in his hand to set fire to the constitution He is a second Guy Faux attempting to blow up both houses of Parliament a wretch that covets only as do that desperate assembly on the other side the water to embrue his hands in his country's blood And after all was the Genius of this isle to withdraw its patronage and exclude it from the orb of its influence was a revolution to take place a subversion of  things to ensue and the reverend Bishops degraded and made to starve as do the French Prelates in a foreign garret upon sixpence a day was the dignity of the peerage to be trampled on and their august house laid in ruins in short was our wise and keensighted monarch tumbled from his throne these miscreants that bellow forth equality these fireandfaggot men these incendiaries of the state these murderers of the peace and happiness of mankind might have their wish they might huzza and trample over the devastatation they occasion  but what would it all tend to  Order Order Order  was vociferously called for by the opposition part of the room and Patrick O'Conner an Irishman was louder than the rest  I beg lave Mr President said he to call the jontleman that spoke last to order and to tell him a little bit of a secret that those who contend for leeberty are neither torchcarriers incendiaries nor murderers that Patrick O'Conner that is to say my own self is one of the leebertyboys in Dublin but though I was born in that city I am nevertheless d'ye see an Englishman It matters not at all where a man is born he is not a horse becase he was born in a stable Our principles Mr President are to overtrow arbitrary  power tyranny and insolence and little Patrick O'Conner will never be wanting in his part whilst he is able to wield a shilelah Let me tell you that our constitution is no constitution at all at all that the law was given as Tommy Paine says by a rogue of a conqueror whose name I have forgot and it would be well for this country if the Dukes and the Lords of Manors d'ye see forgot it too we should have no such squabbling about a silly hare or an insignificant partridge The feudal system Mr President which by the bye is a system of oppression was introduced by this same conqueror and the government in that  man's hands was a government of despotism When he parcelled out the lands which he took from their right owners among his banditti he gave the staff out of his own hands for in a short space of time instead of one tyrant in this country there were manyfait and you may say that too there were two or three hundred These men governed instead of the King and gave one of the Henry's I am told the De'el burn him leisure to play the same game in Ireland and enslave our dear sweet country as well as his own The consequence of this Mr President was that instead of Kings ruling the Barons the Barons ruled  the kings and were far greater tyrants than he who created them Upon this d'ye see the Kings of England took the alarm and called an assembly of the people that the nation might not be overrun with aristocrates but these overbearing fellows I understand did not part with all their power but said to the Commons If you sit in one house to take care of yourselves we will sit in another to take care of  ourselves  and the King God bless him shall sit in a house alone be his own President and take care of  himself  So that you see Mr President here are your tree estates of the empire as that jontleman says who spoke last and was  called to order So that we are all now to take care of ourselves and by my fait and conscience Patrick O'Connor will be the first to do this In short it appears to me that these tree estates with the privilege of interrupting each other have the great power of doing noting at all What then is this mighty constitution we boast so much of A mere bubble The people it is true have in some measure acquired the asscendency have mollified and filed down d'you see the knots and rugged points of the cudgel held over them but the cudgel like my shilalah is strong and tough enough to make them smart We have  We have heard gentlemen a great dealYou may talk of your privileges till you are tired I see none equal to that of being at leeberty to stop a fools mouth By St Patrick I wish I had the stopping of all your mouths you would then talk a little more to the purpose If you are for levelling why do it by halvesIf you level one ting and not another d'ye see it will be like hill and dalethere will be be no equality I'm for overtrowing the whole together Down with the lawyers let us trust to ourselves Down with the churches we can pray in our closets Down with the army we can fight our own battles Down with the whigs and down with  the tories and we shall be all of one party This will be something like an equality and then  he who has the strongest arm will claim the biggest share  It has always been the study of administration  Mr Chairman since I have known what administration is says Jack Latitat who was one of the company to do good to society and consult their ease their happiness and interest I defy any man within his own memory to deny the truth of this assertion Politicians may differ in opinion and oppose but that opposition if they would speak their honest sentiments rises only from jealousy at their not being employed in the affairs of government  and from envy of those who  are  employed Look to all the acts of the state and tell me if they have not a good tendency and that if any measure has not answered the expectation of parliament it has not been immediately altered There is nothing I see to complain of but an injudicious expenditure sometimes of the public money and why may not this be the case as well under a republican government as in the present state of things I admit that the influence of the Minister in the House of Commons is an evil that requires to be remedied but the remedy lies with the people If the electors of this kingdom would be steady and  firm lay down certain rules for their representatives to follow and determine to elect no man who should deviate from the instructions he receives one who has any apparent connection with the Upper House or who holds any place under government the evil by such perseverance would in time cease but the electors are such blockheads as to sell themselves and then wonder at being sold This brings me Mr Chairman to the subject I was called on to explain by the Scotch gentleman in the corner He says money seems to have little value and that I can tell you the same There is a kind paradox in  this Seldom do we meet with any thing of intrinsic value but it carries that value in its face or appearance not so in money that it is a thing of inestimable value is evident for to what lengths will not men go to get possession of it They will run into every excess into every absurdity and into every vice They will swear flatter vilify abuse cheat play the fool speak the truth lie squander scrape together plunder nay even murder to acquire it Get money if you can honestly said a writer of antiquity but however get money and when they have with great pains got it what do they with it but  throw it away on things of little or no value The origin of all this absurdity is that the age is vicious and unprincipled that men are looked up to not for their abilities their services or good works but for their property and wealth See a man passing by meanly clad tell your friend that man is worth l and he stares at him again and again but tell him there goes a good man or there goes a man of great abilities and he passes unnoticed Now as the eyes of all men are turned upon riches and that man is  coeteris paribus  most respected who has most money every man tries to outvie his neighbour  and to make the best appearance he can  Keep up appearances there lies the text  The would will give thee credit for the rest  Churchill  Under this notion he lives beyond his income and thus lives a great deal upon the credit his tradesmen give him he spends that money for them which they have not the spirit to spend for themselves Tradesmen in this case are not to be pitied it is only the biter bit What leads men in trade to give uncommon credit but to induce fools and spendthrifts to deal with them and to enable them to demand an inequitable and enormous profit All ending in the love of that pelf which when they have  got they rather throw away than make a proper use of Extortion thus robs itself and verifys the old proverb Grasp all lose all I am one who is up to all this I study to punish the extortioner in doing this I enjoy many of the good things in life which would otherwise escape me There is an old law subsisting by prescription that puts a rod in the hand of the extortioner to punish those who attempt to punish him I mean the law of arrest This is doubtless a law of oppression and owing to the great chicanery of this law might overcomes right thousands of villains get their bread and one man can trample upon another  But government profits by this villainy and suffers it to go on This like the venality of parliament is an evil that calls loudly for redress but it does not follow that a new system of government is necessary on this account or any other Indeed the last evil I complain of I mean the Law of Attachment is no evil to me I make a virtue of necessity have the myrmidons out of the purses of those who employ them Upon the whole Mr Chairman the government is no great eyesore to me the evils of life I reconcile to myself pass by the indifferent get out of the way of the worst and scramble  through them as well as I can  Latitat casting his eyes on his friend Ramble pushed his way up to him said he presumed he had heard nonsense enought for one night and took him away  CHAP XVI  THE Colonel had been in town some weeks and had heard nothing of Miss Raspe but still had little to apprehend having when he left Scotland  given her full directions how to find him and having ordered Flint to make a rapid march to Liverpool to reconnoitre the enemy's camp watch their motions and when he could gain intelligence of Mr Raspe and his daughter leaving Liverpool to make the best of his way to London and acquaint him with it Flint had a deal of sly cunning about him and was very adequate to the task nor had the Colonel reason to fear he would throw himself in Mr Raspe's way so as to alarm his suspicions  Bridget Lady Dashit's waitingwoman never lost sight of the scheme she had planned of imposing Dangle's valet on her mistress in the character of  a gentleman in order to get at her fortune and divide it between them for this purpose she was frequently with him at Dangle's lodgings when his master was out I will therefore lay before my readers a further dialogue of this hero and heroine as taken down upon Tom's examination You must mind now says Bridget when they next met how you act and take care not to betray yourself I have prepared my Lady to receive you some morning of which I will let you know the day before Mind now you must not be slobbering and kissing her all the time you are there as you do me she's a mighty woman for decency and decorum An occasional kiss welltimed is all that  is necessary I shall contrive to be present at least some part of the time and watch your motions Mindyou are to be Sir Thoma Flam I have told her you have a great estate in Yorkshire l a year be very generous as to settlements and all that and you may do what you please with her  Tom  Suppose I should be known by any of your fellowservants  Bridg  I'll take care that William shall be out and I don't believe you are known to any one else after the first interview you may appoint to meet her at any other place  Tom admiring himself  You must not be admiring  yourself  but admire  her  say all the tender things you can  Tom  Let Tom alone for that I believe he has as much to say to the women and knows as well how to please them as any gentleman in town  Bridg  Come let's see how you'll begin practise a little upon me  Tom  We shall be interrupted  Bridg  Don't be afraid of that  looking round  I see no one in the way  Tom  Well then I'll begin thus with a distant bow  bows affectedly  and then I'll advance with a respectful look and withhappy my dear Madam is Sir ThomasWhat's my name  Bridg  Flam  Tom  Ay FlamHappy my dear Madam is Sir Thomas Flam in the opportunity you have been pleased to  indulge him with of throwing himself at your feet  kneels and takes Bridget by the hand  and declaring how much he adores you  Bridget  And is that the way you mean to begin I thought a lover at the first meeting always saluted his mistress I would not give a pin's point for any other introduction  Tom still kneeling  I am coming to thatAnd permit me in the warmth of my passion to approach your sweet lips and say  kisses her warmly  I could dwell on them the whole day  Bridget breaking from him almost breathless  This I think will do but don't imagine Tom that when you are married I shall suffer you to be inattentive  to  me  If you have any fondness for her afterwards I shall be as jealous as the devil for my great failing is that I love you too well  Tom  My dear Bridgetnever doubt meyou shall have  all my affections  and  half her money  CHAP XVII  TO give my reader a farther insight into Spatter's character whose lying disposition often brought him into hot water I will lay before him a dialogue that passed between him Rattle  Dangle and Saunter one morning in a retired part of St Jame's park as it was related to my friend Will the next morning Rattle Dangle and Saunter were first together walking Rattle asked Dangle among other things concerning the strange tale that was all the town over"Yes" adds Saunter with his usual spleen yawning as if he had been up all night and scarce able to keep up with his company  that you was turned out of some girl's house for daring to make a proposal to her    No no says Rattle that's not the story how was it Dangle    You are pleased Gentlemen returned he to be very merry at my expencethere was no  turning out in he case nor any  proposal  thought of    That I'll be sworn says Rattle addressing himself to Saunter for he never had resolution to propose to any woman    Nor if he had returned Saunter would any woman listen to him He has not address sufficient to draw attention  This nettled Dangle and he retorted upon Saunter  Was I blessed with your vivacity yawning and dragging his legs after him in imitation of Saunter and rhetoric I might perhaps stand a little chance  I had rather be asleep all my life replyed Saunter than be treated with the contempt the girls treat you with  Dangle now grew warm  said  the whole was a trumped up affair and not a syllable of truth in any part of it    Nay said Rattle Saunter's my author  and Saunter  Spatter's mine  Spatter at this instant joined them  Did not you tell me Spatter says Saunter laughing that Dangle was  turned out  of some girl's house for  daring  to make a proposal of marriage to her  Spatter now was gravelled He first eyed Dangle then Saunter conscious of having said so and knowing it was false he knew not how well to bring himself off But as those who are continually telling lies are always on the look out for resources to excuse themselves Spatter cries out  starting and lifting up his eyes  Me  Lord Lord how stories are perverted by carryingWhat I said was with a view of raising Dangle in the opinion of his friendsheyou know is said to want resolutionand I  Sir  replies Dangle angrily and interrupting him Spatter still at a loss how to proceed continued  Resolution I mean with respect to the  women  How you take me upThat is to say you wait upon them for years and trifle with them Now I wished to have it known that is by no mean the caseOn Saunter's saying Dangle will never get a wife for the women despise himI beg your pardom says II beg your pardon  many a girl would be glad to have him but he is a man of discernment and will not tie himself where he is not likely to be happy    Did not you returned Saunter staring in Spatter's face with a look of resentment Did not you say that he was  turned out of doors  Spatter who now began to wish himself any where but where he was replied  You shall hear what I said if you have but patience  Rattle continuing Saunters method of address  Ay and that they slapped the door in his face  And Saunter again without suffering Spatter to reply  and that he was forbidden to come there any more  Spatter now losing all temper cried  Nono  no  uttering each  no  with a degree of increased vociferation  It is impossible gentlemen to go on if I am to be so interruptedthen lowering his tone Let me see  recollecting himself  Where was IOh that Dangle was a man of discernment and would not fix where there was not a prospect of happinesswhere there was not a prospect of happiness  so far says I from his trifling with the women to my certain knowledge he made a proposal of marriage the other day to a very respectable lady whom I could name if I thought proper but with whom he could not succeed from an unconquerable aversion she had to him  Here Rattle  laughed heartily at Dangle and cried  Go on Spatterlet's have itall the women hate him  Saunter who was half asleep at this part of the story but who was roused by Rattle's noise starts and cries  How how I lost that    Where's the wonder says Rattle to himWhy was not you awake  Dangle now addressed himself to Spatter seriously asking him  what he meant by representing things so falely told him he was a mongrel between ill nature and false art and might be well classed with these creatures whom God never made What aversion continued he could she have to  me  Spatter now grew warm and declared  he never said any such thing  how can I go on said he with the relation if you break in upon me so often I said unconquerable aversion to  it  that is to  matrimony  winking at Rattle and Saunter I could never suppose any woman could have an aversion to  you  No that would be unnatural sneering and saying to himself I must get out of this dm'd difficulty some way  aversion to it  were the words that is to  marriage  for unaccountable as it is some women are averse to it There's Lady Bab Squeamish and many more I could mention of the same turnand that this lady to whom you proposed requested time to consider of itthat  was all Upon my soul gentlemen if your ears are so treacherous as to mislead your understandings I must lock up my mouth in future Saunter are you for the billiard table  I am says he yawning agreeable to any thing    For continues Rattle imitating Saunter he has nothing to do Saunter is a man of great business and is jaded to death every day with doing nothing Eating drinking sleepingevery thing fatigues him He is too lazy even to put his own cloaths on    Don't call it  laziness  said Spatter you do him wrong it is a philosophic indolence the work of a mind weaned from all the pursuits of life    No no returned Rattle it is a constitutional idleness So idle is he that I believe if he was under the necessity of working for his living he would suffer himself to perish with hunger You are a lazy fellow Spatter but you love to talk but even talking tires Saunter    I wish returned Saunter to Rattle talking tired  you  I will own to you that there is not any thing so tiresome to oneself as an idle life but the less a man says the less nonsense he broaches and the less tiresome he is to others  Verbum sapienti  if the cap fits you Rattle wear it    Come Gentlemensays Dangle don't let us be sparring here let us adjourn to the table and  try if we can get into better humour  Saunter dropping his hat begged of Rattle to pick it up for him  Not I says Rattle you have nothing to do you know and therefore may stoop for it yourself  He then applyed to Dangle for the same purpose  Rot me if I do  said Dangle He asked Spatter but Spatter also refusing was obliged to stoop for it himself but did it with that difficulty attendant upon indolence and picking up his hat he dropped his stick which he thus addressed  I won't be at the trouble of stooping again for  you  however you may lie there till the next person comes by and if he picks you up he'll deserve you  CHAP XVIII  MY friend Will who in the goodness of his heart having been security for one of his acquaintances for the sum of l signed a bond in judgment for the same was now called on in a hostile manner for the money and not being master of that sum was arrested and his goods taken in execution With a degree of imprudence on a presumption that he should marry Miss Raspe and in order that he might have a place to bring her to he took a house in London and furnished it elegantly and thus stripped himself of the best part of his ready  eash He had some securities as I have mentioned which his father left him and he meant to raise money on the same not only for himself but for his friend Charles Simple That young gentleman however having settled his matters with his wife's father stood not in need of it of course Ramble having as he thought sufficient for his present exigencies deferred making any application for more and not being provided for this unexpected call was hurried away to the house of a sheriff's officer Spatter soon heard of it hasted to Lady Dashit's with the news and meeting with her ladyship and Miss Trevor together  Bless me Ladies  said he almost out of  breath  I have the most unfortunate piece of news to tell youthe most unlucky circumstance  The ladies were alarmed and Lady Dashit interrupted him with  not very bad I hope    Bad returned he Poor Colonel RambleI am so distressed I hardly know how to ralate it  Miss Trevor was ready to faint and saying in a low voice  she hoped nothing had happened to the Colonel  Lady Dashit wishing to smother it said  No  not  to Colonel Ramble  and said to Spatter  For God's sake don't mention the Colonel hereand winking at him You have nothing to tell us about Colonel Ramble  But he not taking the  hint went on  It is  all  about Ramable had it happened to any other person it would not have affected me  Miss Trevor rather recovered enquired if he had met with any accident any fall or wound  No Ma'am said Spatter he has not fallen into a bog nor into a millpond that would be nothing there would be some hopes of getting him out from thencebut he has fallen  At these words Miss Trevor had nearly fainted a second time and Lady Dashit could not help saying to Spatter  See what your foolish tongue does I'll lay my life after all it is nothing of any consequence adding angrily Where has he fallen    Into the  hands of the  lawyers  said Spatter Is  that  of no consequence Rot me if I would not as soon have fallen from a housetop    That returned Lady Dashit I long expected You fee my dear Emily addressing herself to Miss Trevor who was now in little better spirits how this mighty accident turns out at which you were so much alarmed  I am answered Miss Trevor of Mr Spatter's opinion that a man cannot have a worse thing happen to him than to fall into the hands of the lawyers  So say I Miss Trevor returned Spatter so say I  Be kind enough says Miss Trevor to tell us the particulars  I am anxious to know them    I thought you would returned Spatterthat made me hurry so fast here I have not stopped at any one place since I heard it but to drop a hint of it at Lady Bab's and at another house or two in my way    That is to say observed Lady Dashit aside totrumpet it all the town over  Miss Trevor with a well disposed heart remarked that if he was in any difficulty it must have been goodnature that brought him into it but Spatter with that rancour that led him to misconstrue the best actions replied  What you are pleased to call  goodnature  I  call  folly His  good natured actions arise from ostentation I would take care of myself before I thought of others Selfpreservation is the first law of nature and he that does not attend to it deserves no pity    If I have not been misinformed said Miss Trevor you Mr Spatter have experienced the good effects of his attention    Aye added Lady Dashit and a grateful man will never forget past services    Don't apprehend Lady Dashit retorted Spatter snearingly that I am under any obligations to Colonel Ramble What he has done for me were mere acts of civility No Madam I have always taken  care to avoid being under obligations to a man of  his  stamp    Well returns Miss Trevor we will not enter into that I wish only to know his present situation    Unwilling as I am answered Spatter to enter into this unhappy affair of Ramble's for with all his faults I have a regard for him and I hate gossiping mortally I cannot  but  obey your commands 'You must know then ladies that the Colonel was imprudent enough to be security for Sam Careless to extricate him from a difficulty He entered into a bond of  l  Sam has left him in the lurch Ramble is arrested on the bond and an execution  is sent into his housethat's all  Miss Trevor observed it was but a trifling sum to a man of his fortune  Trifling as it is returns Spatter it has lodged him in a spunginghouse  Lady Dashit asked him if he meant to call on him there observing it would be humane in his friends to do it now Spatter ter said he would not see him for the world He had to great a regard for him and it would affect him too much Besides his time was too much taken up  I have more than twenty places to call at this day could ill spare the time to slip in here only I was eager to acquaint you with the news    and as Lady Dashit observed to Emily aside  lest any other should do it before him  Miss Trevor was quite unhappy at this account and was determined if she could contrive it so as that the Colonel should not know from what quarter his release came to send the money for his discharge  When a man falls into the hands of the Lawyers he cannot generally speaking surely fall into worse hands Putting the attornies out of the question I have often considered with myself and endeavoured to  reconcile with justice the professon of a barrister Does he not plead the cause of equity and does he not help those out who cannot or could not plead for themselves Some I will admit do but some do not If a barrister would act conscientiously take up no cause till he has well examined it and not argue in its defence unless there is legal honest ground for so doing he would be a praiseworthy character but when a barrister will take up any cause that is proposed to him right or wrong it reverses the case It is the misfortune that barristers never see their briefs till they are retained and when  once retained if they do not exert themselves in defence of their clients whether this client be an honest man or a villain they are censured in their profession and are sure to lose the favour of the attornies that employ them Now he that has the most business at the bar is all things considered a worse man and a worse member of society than if he had less eminence for the more causes a barrister is engaged in the more injustice he does The man who has the happy facility of converting truth into falsehood of explaining away right and making the best stand against justice and equity is sure to have  the most briefs If he knows how to browbeat an evidence perplex and puzzle him so as to make him seemingly contradict himself and is master of such fallacious arguments as will mislead an uninformed ignorant jury he is deemed clever and reckoned a good orator for such I am sorry to say it is too much the oratory of the bar and business will flow in upon him fast His distinguished abilities make the attornies in a bad cause fly to him in preference and thus of twenty causes he is likely to have eighteen bad ones to defend Now if he who father's a lie and promulgates it as we have  seen Spatter do is equally criminal with the fabricator or inventor he surely who takes up a bad cause is equally criminal with the party who employs him There may be some plea in favour of a man who espouses such a cause from error of judgment from false conception or from ignorance but there can be none for him who takes pay to plead in behalf of the oppressor and to the injury of the distressed Such a one is a mercenary hireling an assassin and robber of the unfortunate and so far from being commendable like the slanderer we have seen he deserves execration by all good men and the  so in proportion to the abilities he has of perverting judgment and the power he possesses of doing it His eminence at the bar is a collateral proof of the baseness of his mind  It is under this idea that in Sweden and some other countries a man is obliged to plead his own cause the profession of a barrister being there held in so odious and contemptible a light that no gentleman will take it up the executioner in Sweden is a far more respectable character Putting the immorality of the profession out of the question its civil turpitude is  there held too great to be any way countenanced If a barrister though retained would dare to throw down his brief when he finds his cause a bad one it would render him an exalted character and should he by this mode of conduct be at the the receipt of less money he would have more reputation would deserve what he earns and enjoy it with credit and an unappalling conscience  CHAP XIX  THOUGH Spatter thought proper to desert his friend in distress it was not so with Rattle Dangle and Latitat Rattle and Dangle not knowing where to find Ramble flew to his house then taken possession of by a sheriff's officer who when they entered was smoaking a pipe with a tankard in his hand comforting himself with the good birth he had and saying there was plenty of stout in the cellar and he hoped the gentleman would not be able to make up his affairs while that lasted Rattle and Dangle came together and on enquiring if  any of Colonel Ramble's people were in the way was answered by this surly fellow "No" Attempting to go into some of the inward rooms the officer stopped them with  Hey hey Where are you going I am master of this house and there's no admittance for  you  I am placed here to see that nothing's carried off and therefore shan't trust either of you out of my sight  On their saying they wished to see the Colonel and asking where he was this fellow replied  At the lockuphouse in Chancery Lane where I believe you'll find him any day this week After this if you want him you must look for him in the Bench  The  King's Bench you mean  says Rattle  Aye returned the officer the King's Bench I suppose you know the place it won't be the first time you have been there I dare say  Cease your impertinence friend said Dangle we say nothing to give you offence  Marry retorts the fellow there's no cause to be angry many an honest gentleman has lodged in that place and many a noe  will  again When they're overwhelmed with debts they go there to pay them  You mean says Rattle to retrench their expences    I mean no such thing said the officer I have known a man live as well there as in any part of the  kingdom keep as good a table and as genteel an equipage and in termtime at liberty to go as far any day as he pleases and what's the best of it all this at the expence of other people    True replied Dangle there is some pleasure in that consideration and aside to Rattle What a dry dog it is  You say in Chancery Lane  says Rattle  Yes replied the fellow in Chancery Lane hard by the pump where the lawyers drink in nonterm  Dangle observing to Rattle that things wore a strange face to what they did a few hours ago Rattle cried  Pugh he'll be out again tomorrow and nothing adds more to  a man's credit in the police world than to have an execution or two in his house There's my Lord Squander has had eleven at one time he puts the fellows into livery they line the passage as his company pass and cut a very respectable figure A friend of his ofserving to him one day that the had an uncommon suite of servants his answer was that he was never without them" It requires contrivance only to make disgrace fashionable You know how Latitat glories in writs and arrests  Scarce had he said these words but Latitat bolts into the room his coat frogged with writs and a bunch of them in his hat by way of a cockade He  passed by Rattle and Dangle run up to the officer and shook him by the had with  Hah my friend Spunge how goes it  The officer here was all humility and respect enquired how his Honour did asked him to drink and also to walk into any apartment he pleased And why all this because Jack was in fee with all the sheriff's officers in London Having paid his respects to this man he turned to his friends saying  You seem to stare at all this that's because you are not up to it I have such a respect for sheriffs officers arrests and writs that you see I am cloathed in them  I make it a rule never to pay a  bill till I am arrested So you see what a patriot I am and how much I study the good of my country Shew me the man among all your acquaintance except myself who will pay two guineas instead of one in order to increase the revenue of the stamps The easy creditgiving world don't like much trouble Was I to pay a bill on being asked to do it it would not answer my plan I never discharge an account without being sued I endeavour to deal with those only who dread the law but when I am arrested I pay and then only and if upon such occasions I pay a little more than I otherwise  should a second satisfaction hangs to it With all my smattering for trade you know I hate keeping accounts and filing receipts and when I pay the accommodationfee I consider myself safe from being obliged as many are to pay the same bill a second time for a writ and its discharge is a receipt in court    You are replied Rattle my dear Jack one of the happiest fellows of the age You extract virtue from necessity enjoy what would be the disaster of thousands and scramble on through life as you call it without a scratch or a pain    It would do your heart good Rattle continued he to come and  see my vestibule I am now fitting it up and though you will scarce believe it I buy the hangings of the lawyers    Hanging it said Dangle with old parchments I suppose    Not quite so bas as that retorts he my hangings are suitable to the expenditure and figure of a man of  l  a year There's not a square inch that costs me less than a guinea and by the time I have hung the whole room it will cost me some thousands I shall do it however at last my boy exulting and then I shall immortalize my name Every writ I am served with I tack up against the wall leaving one end loose and it gives  me rapture when the window is open to see them shivering and hear them rattling in the air the music is divine I swing myself round and enjoy the sight A descendant of the oldest British family could not be prouder in an ancient hall of audience of the trophies of his progenitors  Haec sunt insignia mea  These are my bannersthe glorious atchievements of my ancestry It would delight you to see how I strut about  in hoc vestibulo meo  I call it my court of requests my audiencechamber where I receive embassy's from the crown Dmn me if I believe there is such another room in the three kingdoms Come  Gentlemen you seem to be idle suppose I go and shew it you    You had better get into Parliament  said Rattle it would be cheaper in the end though you paid a few thousands for your seat    Psha man returns he that would frustrate my whole plan there's not a fool that would trust a member of parliament now with five pounds That time's overthe House of Commons is not what it was there are so many mercenary and povertystruck fellows now get themselves elected that this honourable house is losing credit daily  The reader will indulge me here  with a few remarks on the law of arrests To what do they tend but to the injury of society The design of attachment was merely to prevent the defendant from escaping whilst the matter against him was under litigation if he can give security for his appearance it is all the law requires if not he is held in custody to wait the event So far it is political but the cause being ended an execution following if the defendant has no property to pay the debt why consine his person take him out of society throw his family upon the parish and deprive the state of his labours Does it pay his debtsNo The execution might seize his property  and if there be not sufficient to discharge the debt and costs he should be obliged to pay the remainder at some future time which by giving him his liberty he might be able to do As things are now the debtor is confined his credit ruined his famimily beggared he waits for an insolvent act and his creditor loses his money The manner in which the law can harrass a debtor may frighten some men from running into debt but it hardens others and puts them on their invention as it has done Jack Latitat But the greatest evil arising from arrests is the abuse of this law and the many villains it creates Many a hundred pettifoggers there are  who have no resource for a maintenance but this They retain a number of runners to whom they give half their fees to find out litigious men and rascals that have fraudulent and fictitious claims upon the property of others accompanied perhaps with a specious claim of forty shillings but which under fair discussion might be disproved Whether these claimants have any substance or not provided the defendant has it is all they want They undertake to carry on the cause for them prevail on them to swear to debts not existing arrest the defendant not suffer the plaintiff to be met with run the cause to issue and the defendant either then proceeds to trial  or not knowing what such villains may there swear to is induced to pay a certain part of it into court which is accepted and the cause ends but with the expence of  l  or more to the defendant besides all the disgrace and trouble of the arrest Nay there are men that will go farther Such attornies in hopes of having the matters compromised and getting their costs paid will serve writs and run the risk if the defendant is a man of spirit and determined to go on with it they will drop the cause at issue and should the attorney get nothing from the defendant he will if possible from his client and the defendant has his own attorney to pay perhaps or  l  This  might be recovered of the plaintiff if he could be found or was worth powder and shot but he is a pauper and not to be met with Both the attornies however have profited and the defendant has been the chief suffereTo shew how dangerous such men are in society take the following anecdote  An attorney seated himself in a countrytown where he thought there was a good opening no attorney having taken possession of the place He had a small independenoe of his own but the people there being of a peaceful disposition he had little or no business and his own money not being sufficient to support him he  told a friend one day that he should be under the necessity of removing his situatiions for the inhabitants of that town were so dmd peaceable that he could not live amongst them Being a pleasant fellow and his friend unwilling to lose him he gave him this advice "Bring some other attorney to settle in the town besides yourself and my life for it you'll find your account int it" He took the hint another of the fraternity was invited there to residence dissentions were thus raised among the people and the two attornies go a very good living  Was there a law enacted that every attorney should give some thousand  pounds security to the public on his admission and if he was nonsuited in any cause be obliged to pay the costs himself he would take care never to engage but in a good cause or oblige his client to give him security for those costs in case he failed in the action This would prevent a a great number of vexatious and litigious suits and if there were fewer rascally attornies there would be more peace and happiness in society  CHAP XX  MISS Trevor found means to free Ramble from his confinement She found out the officer and got a friend to carry him the  l  and the expences without saying where it came from and my friend was at full liberty without the satisfaction of knowing who was his liberator He was exceedingly desirous of finding it out and took uncommon pains so to do  No sooner was he at home than he received the congratulations of his friends and those of Spatter in particular  who flew to him with feeming rapture crying out  My dear Colonel I have been all the town over in search of a friend to extricate you from the difficulty your good heart threw you into and with that view I have told your story to all my acquaintance but I am happy to find the business is done without me It was dm'd shabby of Careless to draw you in to    I don't see it in that light replied Ramble poor fellow he would have paid the money if he could and as he could not it was and is my wish to do it for him    Yes returned Spatter but the disgrace of it    Disgrace it cannot be said Ramble A man  ought never to be ashamed of suffering in a good cause He who fears to encounter a dissiculty for a friend ill deserves to have one  If I may be allowed to say any thing in addition to those of my friend Will upon the occurrences he met with I will here take the liberty of laying before my reader a character I have met with too common in life but being mixed with the world at large is often lost in the crowd and not noticed This is that of a man who purchases a good name from the two lower classes of people which indeed is the mass of men able to stamp a character with respect or disrespect  for they are the greater part of the people and it is too universally believed that what the world says must be true If a man but pays his debts when called on is free with his money and puts up with no indignity he is in the eye of the present age a man of honour and a gentleman His moral character is seldom enquired into he may get drunk keep as many whores as he will and be the greatest libertine uncensured Such a man will have much longer credit than others and treadesmen will be more obedient to his call for it is selfinterest that leads mankind and even warps their way of thinking I knew a gentleman of small fortune but who had  a fuffielent income to pay all his tradefmen he was an economist and not void of principle I heard this gentleman once chide his wife soon after marriage for paying a bill unasked It is time enough said he to pay when two or three bills have been sent in He did not act on the principle of  Latitat  who by witholding a debt due made interest of the money but acted on the idea that it is right to do as the world does Nothing continued he is so unfashionable as to call for a tradesman's account If you make it a rule to do this you may be called a good paymaster but you will be vulgar in the extreme This gentleman did not plead want of cash but  was never at home to his tradesmen he kept a lying fellow at his door who after many years importuning gained them access to his master only by the presentment of a fee But yet this gentleman when he  did  pay never examined the particulars of a bill let it be of ever so long standing but referred only to the sum total and paid like a gentleman  Your honour will please to observe says the obsequious tradesman that I have charged every artiele at the lowest price and I hope your goods pleased    I am perfectly satisfied said the gentleman and think myself much obliged to you  The money paid they part one with seeming gratitude  the other with professions of future employ I was once with him when he paid his taylor a long bill of six years standing the amount of which was  l  he looked only at the sum total and on my enquiring when the taylor was gone whether he never examined into the article of a bibl  Articles retorted he Znds if I looked at  them  I should go mad for my taylor is as great a rascal as ever lived I would not deal with him but he gives me long credit  This credit if he managed his little fortune well he would not want and if he paid his taylor yearly whilst the artickes were in remembrance he would save per cent but to be thought fashionble  he chose to have fashionable credit and be thought a man of honour He had lived long enought in the world to know that a good name is easily acquired by purchase and therefore he bought that good name He was liberal to the poor in his neightbourhood not from a principle of charity for he gave away indiscriminately I went with him once to a public house in his village to ask some questions of the landlord It was winter and three or four impudent country fellows were sitting round the sire with their hats on One of them said to the rest loud enough to be heard leering with his eye and putting out his tongue  Twig the  Squire  This did not disconcert him he stopped any further disrespect by saying to the landlord it was cold weather pitied those who were obliged to work abroad for their living ordered him to make those lads at the fire a three shilling bowl of good warm punch and begged they would drink his health No sooner was the purchase made than the article respect was immediately delivered The fellows no sooner heard him give this direction to the landlord than they jumped from their seats with  Won't your honour please to come to the fire  and on quitting the house he observed to me  You see how readily a few shilling soften down roughness of  manners and insolence of behaviour into complaisance and respect  Passing a turnpike with me one day in his own parish he gave the tollgatherer a shilling with  I don't recollect having given you any thing to drink a long time    This man said I is one of your tenants I presume    I scarce know his name replied my friend but I never forgot to fee him It is no bad thing to have a good name at a turnpike and especially when a loose shilling will get it A traveller who has heard of your and who perhaps has not exercised his tongue for some time on the road will take an opportuity of doing it where he can  and sond of enquiries in strange places may on passing this gate ask if Squire such a one does not live somewhere about here Oh yes returns the man his honour lives not far off He is a worthy genetleman And this character is purchased It is a pity things should be so but so they are and the old agage is too often verified No longer pipe no longer dance  CHAP XXI  FLINT had been in town a fortnight night and had brought an account that Mr Raspe and his daughter had left Liverpool the day before him but as the Colonel had received no letter from Miss he concluded they must either have stopped at the house of some friend in the road or that Miss Raspe had not found an opportunity of giving him notice of it He had been writing a note to Miss Trevor to introduce himself on Dangle's business and he dispatched Flint with itThe letter was to this effect  Colonel Ramble's best compliments to Miss Trevor and having something for her private ear solicits the indulgence of half an hour's conversation If agreeable and she is disengaged he will do himself the honour of paying his respects to her tomorrow at two  Flint though he had travelled twenty miles this morning was not fatigued or our of spirits but set off with his master's letter with alacrity and brought him word that he had delivered the letter but that Miss Trevor was not at home  I can't pass unnoticed and accident  that happened to Flint to shew the danger and villainy of a London mob I can scarce suppose it the same in any metropolis but in this Every little unusual occurrence draws together a crowd of people to enquire into the cause and the pickpockets take the opportunity to rob the byestander of his purse his watch his handkerchief c Processions a fire a battle between two men or boys a woman fainting a drunken man an accident of any kind is sufficient to call the attention of a London mob and draw the people together and the vagabondthieves are so numerous and destitute as industriously to fight pretended battles and create incitements to  a mob that they may have their wishedfor opportunities Careful and cautious people are aware of this and take pains to avoid a crowd but the thoughtless and inconsiderate will rush eagerly into one and become the objects of plunderFlint in his way from Lady Dashit's got into a hobble that had nearly ended with much worse consequences than it did Though he had a good deal of foresight not being well acquainted with London he was not up to all the tricks of sharpers and pickpockets He loved a bustle and was fond of running into every crowd he met At CharingCross a drunken fellow with a pipe and tabor had called together the  idle and the vagabonds and a pretty smart mob was collected these are the times when thieves and pickpockets watch their opportunity to disburthen those who are encumbered with any little matters about themFlint was the foremost in this mob and a fictitious battle taking place he took some pains to inspirit the combatants  Well done Scarlet Jacket Mind your eye Bandylegsthrow your blows in streight and thickhit him in the breadbasketkeep him at arm's length  Such were the terms of the pugilistic art in which Flint in intimating to the combatants was very vociferous Whilst the corporal was thus engaged  a baker's boy ran up against his coat Flint's attention being thus called off a rascal stepping forward industriously wiped off the flour from his coast and whispered in his car to take care of an illlooking fellow near him or he would lose his handkerchief Endeavouring to save this the fellow picked his pocket of his tobacco box another behind him stole his cap whilst a third treading down the heel of his shoe kicked it off and thus robbed him of his filver buckle Endeavouring to recover his shoe he lost his watch got his head broke and narrowly escaped being charged with being a pickpocked himself being dragged to a  horse pond and ducke He scrambled and fought his way through the mob as well as he could and comforted himself when out of danger with having delivered his master's letter  Arrah by my conscience said he if these be your London tricks Flint will be match for you another time he will carry nothing about him and then you may steal it and welcome  There was seldom a circumstance that happened to him but he communicated it to his master but this story he was afraid to tell lest he should be laughed at and called a fool for his pains  Chap XXII  BUT we must not omit to relate what passed at Lady Dashit's when Flint delivered his master's letter  Bridget had prepared her Lady to receive Tom's first visit who had procured a suit of cloaths that fitted him well but being unused to a sword it was frequently between his legs and nearly throwing him down Tom was shewn up by a servant who had received Bridget's orders to admit no one into the room till Sir Thomas Flam was gone This was a necessary  precaution lest he should be accidentally discovered  Tom was brought in a chair and being ushered up into a room Bridget first gave him the meeting with  Who'll say Tom you do not look like a gentleman now  turning him round and admiring him  your are Sir Thomas Flam all over    Yes replies Tom I think I know how to put cloaths on when I have any to put on I have been practising that theses seven years Is the coast clear    Miss Trevor she said was just gone out in the chariot and her Lady was ready to receive him  Tom said his heart failed him in the  business but Bridget eneouraged him with  Psha NonsenseYou have impudence enough upon some occasions and when a good fortune's at stake it is worth an attempt she is tired of a single life and will be easily won Indeed the women are  all  easily won I know the sex well The only want pressing    If that will do returned Tom faith she shall have enough of it  Bridget then left him to acquaint her Lady of his being there and Tom in the mean while examining himself in the glass observed that the coat fitted him to a tee  Lady Dashit soon entered the room  and affected to appear confused Bridget was peeping behind and Tom bowing affectedly Lady Dashit first broke the silence with  Your name Sir I understand is Sir Thomas Flam    Sir Thomas Flam at your Ladyship's service  replied Tom Lady Dashit could not help noticing to herself that he was a very gentlemanlike man and begged him to be seated Tom began  Though Madam I may be a stranger to your Ladyship you are not so to me I have admired you frequently and ardently wished for an opportunity of telling you so  To which Lady Dashit replied with a good deal of confusion  I scarce know how Sir Thomas to  consider this otherwise than as a compliment when there must be no doubt a number of young ladies in the circle of your acquaintance that must be noticed by you    True Madam said Tom there are but I hate your young ladies boardingschool misses and novelreading girls When a man looks for a wife he wishes to meet with a woman of sense and discretion a lady like yourself who to elegance of person and a sufficient share of beauty is blest with an understanding to make any man happy  During this studied speech he threw his legs and arms about in an affected way as if in raptures with his own  cloquence and Bridget behind seemed not a little pleased with his words and manner wondering where he learnt them Lady Dashit was captivated and affecting a bashful confusion replied  Your compliments Sir quite confuse me Pray Sir Thomas are you acquainted with the Vavasors of Yorkshire I hear your estate lies in that county  During all this time Bridget industriously came backwards and forwards under a pretence of adjusting the room Tom rather hesitating cried  Oh yes Madam    Has the old gentlemen said Lady Dashit got rid of his lameness  Tom not being prepared for this and at a loss could  only say "Madam" Lady Dashit went on  His sciatica has been a troublesome companion to him  Tom not knowing the meaning of the word and supposing it be his wife replied  I have not the honour of knowing the lady  "What lady" retorts Lady Dashit Tom answered "Mrs Sciatica""Mrs Sciatica" explains Lady Dashit with surprize  Sciatica Sir is the hipgout with which Sir Walter has been long afflicted  Tom recovering himself with an affected smile replies  I thoroughly understand what your Ladyship means by sciatica it is I say an attendant which bless my stars I never had the honor of being acquainted  with  rejoicing that he had brought himself off so well Lady Dashit did not rightly enter into this and said with a kind of sarcastic sneer  I don't apprehend Sir Thomas you are acquainted with any of the family  Tom said  Not I indeed    Then why returned Lady Dashit did you say you was    Pardon me Madam answered Tom I understood your Ladyship asked me whether my estate lay in Yorkshire it was to this I answered Yes    I must entreat your excuse then Sir Thomas says Lady Dashit in what part of Yorkshire does it lie  Tom no less confused and at a greater loss than before cries again  Ma'am    Near what town continued Lady Dashit for I am well acquainted with all the ridings  The devil ride her  said Tom to himself turning his head and whispering to Bridget unobserved by her mistress  Where does this estate of mine lie    Any where near  Thirsk  continues Lady Dashit Bridget at a loss whispers to Tom  Say not a great way from York    A little off one side York  says Tom to Lady Dashit  Thirsk replied she is not many miles from the city  Tom still embarrassed stammers out  True Ma'am true Ma'am but my lands are on the opposite side of the city where I  shall be proud of conducting Lady Dashit and putting her in possession of them Do my dear Madam let me hope I may ere long have the happiness to call you mine  Bridget fidgeting about the room and not liking this dull conversation contrived to draw near and whisper him in his ear  Why don't you kneel at her feet and kiss her hand  It may appear a little extraordinary that upon such an interview Lady Dashit should not be more particular with respect to her maid's being present but when it is considered that her maid was her considante of course in the secret and had been the means of introducing Sir Thomas there and when we consider  that Lady Dashit had a blind side and wore a glass eye and Bridget kept on that side of her it is not to be wondered at Lady Dashit did not notice Bridget being attentive only to her own interest  I presume said she Sir Thomas you know what fortune I am possessed of    That  I do said he to himself but addressing himself to her Ladyship  Fortune Madam is not the question He would ill deserve your Ladyship who thought of your fortune I have a very ample one which I shall be proud to share with you Your dear self is the object of my adoration Suffer me to throw myself at your feet and say could I once  have the honour of calling you Lady Flam I should be the happiest of men  Upon this he threw himself upon his knee seized her hand with ardour pressed it to his lips and kissed it with fervour Lady Dashit now affected a girlish confusion rose from her seat begged him to rise uttering with difficulty  To say Sir I am not flattered with your liberality of sentiment would be telling an untruth I am and shall be glad to see you again at your leisure at which time I may be more explicit" Give me leave said Tom in raptures to kiss your hand  and whilst so doing Flint hurried into the room and discovering Tom though  in a new character was struck motionless with surprise Let us dwell a little on the mortification of this scene In the very moment that Bridget and Tom were conceiving themselves in their coaches that this fellow should blunder in and break down all their chimeras He instantly saw through the scheme laid for Lady Dashit spoke not a word but with a look of honest indignation told Tom '  twas at an end  We must break off here to say how Flint obtained admission  CHAP XXIII  RAMBLE had directed Flint if possible to deliver his letter into Miss Trevor's hands which he might do by asking for her maid For he was apprehensive from what he had heard of Lady Dashit if it fell in her way Miss Trevor might not receive it To this end Flint having knocked at the door asked for Mrs Bridget "What do you want with her" said the porter who opened it  What do I want with her returned Flint to be sure I don't want herI have a little bit of a letter  here for here lady    Some petition I suppose or begging letter  said the porter for the ladies were very charitably disposed  we have been pestered with too may of  them  today already    Peteetion cries Flint raising his voice What does the rascal take me for a pauper Look in my cap you teef pointing to his cockade and you'll see I carry the badge of a jontleman  Jontleman  returns the servant imitating Flint's brogue  a pretty sort a gentlemanlike badge truly Now the war's over we shall be overrun with such sorry kind of gentlemen Every idle vagabond who has neither house nor habitation  trade nor profession calls himself a gentleman Go set offyou'll get nothing here  Flint's pride was now roused and he roared out  Hear me fellowa cockade now is the highest badge of distenction What would my little country have been but for those who wore cockades I am a soldier and a soldier is a gentleman all the world over And what is more you poltroon I bear about me the honourable marks of war and am therefore not to be talked to by such a snaking insignificant ting as you I wish I had you at Trincomalee  And at his he shook his cudgel over the fellow's head  Shew me to your Lady immadiately  repeated Flint or by St Patrick I will with this little shillela give you such a bating as you'll feel for these seven years though you were to die tomorrow  This  argumentum baculinum  or fear of drubbing gained him a direction into what room up stairs to go which accounts for his abrupt introduction into Lady Dashit's apartment  The instant Bridget saw Flint she ran up to him and took him out of the room and Tom took that opportunity of taking his leave but with a further invitation to wait on Lady Dashit again Bridget no sooner got him out of the room than she scolded  him for coming up stairs and asked what he wanted  What do I want Maistress returned he why I want the young lady of the house I have a letter for her    Then you should have sent it up  said Bridget  Sent it honey replied Flint Why I might have done that and saved myself the trouble of bringing it I can carry it back again and send it now if that be all    No no fool says Bridget now you  have  brought it you may give it to me Miss Trevor is not at home when she returns I will give it her So you may go  taking him by the shoulder and putting him out  Well returns Flint don't shove  me I think I know that jontleman in the next room give me leave to speak to him Though he's as fine as a jay and looks like a flagstaff on the king's birthday I have seen him in a coarser garb    Hold your silly tongue replied Bridget You know him How should  you  know him That's Sir Thomas Flam a gentleman that's going to be married to my old Ladybut this is a secret    Sir Thomas Flam  exclaims Flint sneering and in going out but not so loud as to be heard  A pretty Flam upon my consience Good luck go with you honeyWell deliver theletter to Miss Trevor You may tell her its  from my Maister Colonel Ramble and that little Flint brought it  When Tom had taken his leave and Flint was gone Lady Dashit rung for her maid enquired who Flint was and how he came to be admitted for which the Porter got a good scolding not only from his Lady but from Bridget  Well my Lady says the latter how does your Ladyship like Sir Thomas Is he not a very elegant sine spoken gentleman He told me on going out that he was all in raptures with your Ladyship  Lady Dashit observing to her that he was a good deal at a loss about the situation of his country seat  I should  have been surprised if he had not says Bridget Every lover is confused at the first interview with his Mistress I could see my Lady that you  yourself  was confused  Very much so indeed returned Lady Dashit It will not be improper however to make some further enquiries about him I think I'll ask Mr Spatter he knows every body  Bridget convinced that Spatter would say he knew him from a foolish pride he took in being acquainted with every titled man urged her Lady to it much and lest she should apply to any other proposed sending to Mr Spatter and begging him to call the first time he came that  way Lady Dashit enjoined her maid to secrecy but she was too much  interested  in the affair as she said to herself not to be as secret as possible  CHAP XXIII  MISS Trevor having sent Ramble an answer upon her return home that she should be happy to see him he waited on her the next morning and was no sooner announed than Miss Trevor told her maid that Colonel Ramble waited on her at his own request begging her private ear for  half an hour on business of moment  Most assuredly Miss said Bridget will my words come to pass He is as much in love with you as you  can  be with him Mr Spatter told me so You are certainly born for each other  Miss Trevor could not but confess that she was partial to him but feared he was too unsettled to think of a wife till he had nearly outrun his fortune  Then make yourself easy returned Bridget pertly for that's pretty well the case elready at least the world says so  This was too much Miss Trevor was nettled  Don't be impertinent said she you take more liberties than become you If  I  think proper to  speak freely of him I won't have  you  do it Go shew the Colonel up  "Marry come up" says Bridget muttering to herself as she left the room  there's more fuss about sweethearts in this house than in the whole parish besides    I beg your pardon Miss Trevor said the Colonel on entering the room for this intrusion but I was desirous of seeing you on a matter of some importance  Chairs being brought and Bridget having left the room Ramble went on  I hope what I have to communicate will attract your attention but should it not meet your approbation trust it will be goodnaturedly forgiven  Miss  Trevor with some confusion said she was persuaded he could offer nothing but what she should be happy to attend to Though the Colonel was far from wanting words and could have addressed any woman for himself yet he found himself embrrassed when pleading the cause of his friend fearing it might not be well received and be deemed impertinence  You are very good said he and polite Miss Trevor and I am proud of the occasion The subject I am to introduce to you is of so serious a nature that I request you will not give a hasty opinion of it  Miss Trevor was all confusion and could not help noticing the Colonel's embarrassment  who now felt for the first time an awkwardness in a loveaffair that he never experienced before Whether it was from having had an intimation of Miss Trevor's partiality for him or whether it arose from his partiality for  her  which seemed to increase at this teteatete is immaterial but so it was he found it difficult yet went on  Your charms and good conduct my dear Miss Trevor as is natural to suppose have made an impression where I can take upon me say no time can erase  The impression Colonel you are pleased to talk of returned Miss Trevor must arise not from any feserts of mine but from a too partial opinion  entertained of me  Every one ceplied Ramble must entertain a partial opinion of Miss Trevor Those who have seen her once must wish to see her again and those whom she is pleased to honour with her notice must stand in raptures at her virtues  Miss Trevor bowing to the compliment but with a smile that would have won the heart of an anchorite observed that she was at a loss to determine which was most inexcuseable unpalatable truths or agreeable insincerities Ramble who was now more in love with her than ever but was tied up by honour and friendship to  smother the passion found himself exceedingly aukward  Call me not insincere said he I am a plain dealer and you must excuse my frankness The amiable qualities you possess the goodness of your heart my dear Miss Trevor and the sweetness of your disposition entitle you to the admiration of every man and permit me to say they have made a conquest of a heart that I should hope you will have some compassion for  You have a happy way Colonel returned she of ingratiating yourself with the women and I have little doubt but that she who can attract  your  attention must be proud of the  conquest  By these words Ramble perceived himself not understood and was therefore determined to cut the matter short lest he should lose his own heart for though he was attached to Miss Raspe and she was a girl whom any man might love yet she had not the understanding nor the independence of Miss Trevor His acquaintance with Miss Raspe was of short duration and it was now some time since he saw her but Ramble was a man of strict honour and having made proposals of marriage to her would never think of flying from them These were his inward thoughts whilst addressing Miss Trevor Determined therefore to bring the matter  to an issue he told her he would not trespass longer upon her patience but take the liberty at once to solicit her hand and heart in favour of one who adored her and could not live without her  My heart replied she is too poor an object to make much parade of it is a trifling silly thing that scarce knows its own interests and I fear of too little consequence to be worth any one's notice  It is I am convinced answered Ramble a heart that every sensible man would be ambitious of obtaining and I honestly declare to you that I never thought my friend Dangle a man of understanding till now  Miss Trevor  till this instant was not undeceived in her hopes but that the Colonel was addressing her for himself and of course testified her surprise at the name of Dangle Ramble proceeded  My dear Miss Trevor Dangle has long loved you and often wished to declare it but a cursed  mauvaise honte  which he cannot get the better of has prevented his saying what he has requested me to say for him Will you give me leave to tell him that you will receive his addresses Believe me you cannot countenance a more honest fellow nor one that will make a better husband  Miss Trevor now betraying more surprise and some marks of  displeasure said  So Sir it is Mr  Dangle  's cause that you have been pleading all this time  Even so Madam answered he the cause of friendship and of love  Then said she I must be under the necessity of telling you that you have been fruitlessly employed I am not insensible of the honour Mr Dangle does me but my heart has  unfortunately  been long engaged to another here she sighed Mr Dangle is a gentleman I shall ever respect as a  friend  but the last man in the world I could bring myself to think of as a  husband  But are you serious in this  returned Ramble  Quite serious  said sheRamble added  he hoped he had not displeased her by the part he had taken  I should have been much better pleased replied Miss Trevor had you taken up less of my time upon the occasion  With this she got up and rung the bell Ramble seeing he had given offence and unhappy at the circumstance said taking her by the hand  Come Miss Trevor it was an act of friendshipyou must forgive me and if ever I undertake such another jobb the devil fetch me  It might said she be an act of friendship to  him  but it surely could be none to  me  however Sir on  condition that you never mention him again I shall think no more of it  Bridget now entered the room she asked if every thing was ready for her above and being answered in the affirmative looked at her watch apologized to the Colonel for leaving him so abruptly fear'd she should not be dressed in time ordered her servant to wait on him down and left him with a heart wretched at the disappointment Ramble felt himself much hurt at thishis goodnature and readiness to oblige his friend had caused him to offend a lady he really respected and various were the suggestions that immediately struck him He could not but dwell on the charms  of Miss Trevor and lament  that  ill luck which engaged him to plead a cause in which he was become so entangled  CHAP XXIV  RAMBLE as I have observed found himself much embarrassed in the affair with Miss Trevor Indeed his sentiments differed so widely from the generality of young men as to be susceptible of many inquietudes they never know He spent some hours one morning in his study contemplating  this business and thus it was he reasoned with himself "What is it said he that so disturbs me I undertook to plead for my friend in behalf of his affection for Miss TrevorWhen I found my own heart interested did I betray my friendNobut as warmly urged his suit as if it had been my ownWould she hear meNobut took offence and would only forgive it on condition that the subject never was renewed with a positive declaration that she never would admit Dangle's suitWas I not then at liberty to have pleaded for myselfYes and thousands would have done it had they felt like me the powerful influence of her charmsHow unfortunate  that he should have applied to me who am now perhaps much more her slave than ever he wasHer manner I think was singularShe appeared sensibly touched with my discourseWhat did she mean by  unfortunately  engaged To whom could that beBut what am I about throwing himself upon his sofa Do I already forget the promises I made Miss RaspeUnlucky cruel hour that linked me to this chain of troubleIn which am I most justifiableIs that man a man of honour who shall rob a parent of his childWill my faith to Miss Raspe compensate for the injury done to her father who builds all his hopes on marrying  her to a noblemanWill not this injustice to  him  cast a shade upon  my  honourMiss Raspe may have and may yet meet many a better offer avoid offending her parent and prevent my doing him an injusticeMiss Trevor is independant and with a good fortune enjoys the disposal not only of that but of her personand was I to marry her I should have no feelings to woundno remorse to sting meWhat not the reproaches of a friendHave  these  no poignancyThey haveMiss Trevor will not hear him of course treachery it cannot beBut have I once dwelt on that which reflects dishonour more than all the restHave I considered the pains  I took to win a heart I now seem so willing to resignWas I happy till I had made Miss Raspe confess her attachment to meWhat a monster an ingrate must I then be to forget myself and the vows I made her"  At this instant Spatter stole into the room with  What asleep Ramble in the middle of the day or musing  Ramble too absorbed in thought to observe him rose from the sofa and went on "How these reflections wound me What pity is due to those who feel as I doMany a man there is who would glory in such difficultiesSuch men may suffer less but such men I despiseShall  I then act in such a manner as" He was proceeding in this strain as Spatter approached him but still lost in thought and turning as he uttered the last word unthinkingly round his face met Spatters who crying "No" aloud as answering to his question startled him and put an end to his reveries  Where did you hide yourself  said he to Spatter  I have been here this half hour replied he and have heard your whole soliloquy  I am sorry for it said RambleYou then can perhaps advise me  Not I believe me said he I have heard a great deal but could make  little out  Know then continued Ramble I have been pleading Dangle's cause with a fine girl and an fallen desperately in love with her myself Though she has absolutely rejected his suit my refined notions of honour forbid me to make any advances for myself  Spatter asked who the girl was and on Ramble's saying he was not at liberty to name her added  Let her be who she will you may be very easy on that score for Dangle's too fashionable a lover to think of a wife Had you obtained the girl's consent he would have been much more embarrassed and chagrined than he will now on being made acquainted with  her refusal  This surprised Ramble and he begged Spatter would be more explicit  His vanity he continued is insupportable In the course of his life he has not courted less than fifty women whom as soon as he discovered that he was likely to succeed with he has absolutely jilted Was you to tell him that his application has been unattended to he would be eager to renew it but tell him he may have her and she may be mine or your's or any man's  You certainly cannot be serious  replied Ramble  Only try the experiment  said Spatter Ramble said it would be telling an untruth which he never could do  Not to  yourself  replied Spatter  No not to serve a  friend  returned Ramble whom I would serve  before  myself    Tell me said Spatter the girl's name and I'll undertake it for youMiss Seabright Lady Bab Squeamish Miss Gadabout Miss Trevor Miss  It is in vain said Ramble to persist was you to name the whole town it would not do    What will you say now adds Spatter if I tell the untruth for you and bring Dangle to relinquish her    Say returns Ramble laughing say you can gulp down a lie better than I can  You don't deserve my good offices replied Spatter but as I shall have  laugh at Dangle's expence I'll set about it  No sooner were the words uttered than Dangle entered the room Spatter runs up to him with  I was flying to you Dangle with joyful tidings Some girl Ramble says to whom he has been speaking in your favour consents to make you happy you have only to buy a license and fix the day    I hope says Dangle to Ramble you have not betrayed me    Not I upon my honour returned he Spatter has tried all he could to learn her name but he is still in the dark    That's true enough cried Spatter bantering him for I would give all the world to know that I might have  the happiness of paying my respects to Mrs Dangle that is to be  Dangle already repented matters had gone so far and began considering how he should get off with Ramble for after all  he'd be curs'd he said if he could tune his mind to matrimony And asked Ramble whether Spatter was not jesting    You must have a bad opinion of my oratory replied he if you doubt its success    To be plain with you Ramble returned Dangle somewhat embarrassed I could not conceive you would have been so expeditious and the design of this visit was to request you to defer the matter till I had reconsidered it  Spatter with a kind of triumph whispered Ramble  Am I right now or not  Ramble addressed himself to Dangle with some warmth and exclaimed  reconsidered it Hearkee Danglewhen you wish to trifle with a lady again I beg you will not make me your instrument I hope I shall never meet you at that house any more    Nay retorted Dangle if you are so warm upon the occasion I must tell you that until you are master of that house or till the ladies refuse to see me I shall go there when I pleaseI see no reason Colonel Ramble for this anger    I don't wish to prevent your going there said Ramble all  I hope is that I may never meet you there as I should not only blush for myself but for  you  I am not unacquainted Dangle with your ridiculous vanity and that this circumstance may not add to your trophies be assured Sir that the lady peremptorily refused to listen to any thing I had to say respecting you You once upon a time told me you would not suffer her character to be trified with this is trifling with it with a vengeance  Dangle asked him warmly whether he meant to insinuate any thing to his disadvantage  Most certainly returned Ramble I do and must acquaint you before your friend Spatter  that your behaviour in this matter has been what I did not expect it was ungenerous in you to employ me before you knew your own mind  Nay Gentlemen interrupted Spatter addressing himself first to one and then to the other  Colonel Ramble Mr Danglethis is making a laughable matter too serious    It is no laughable matter resumed the Colonel I mean to take it up very seriously    Then if it offends you said Dangle you know your remedy I shall be at home the whole of the day and wait your commands  And upon this left them  Upon my soul Ramble said Spatter I am sorry  for this you have carried this affair so far that I fear you cannot refrain from calling him out    He may than  you  for it returned he for had you not laid open his folly to me all would have been well I should have acquainted him with the result of my embassy and things would have rested there    Nay said Spatter I did it to put you at ease I hope however matters may yet be honourably adjusted without coming to extremities    Your ideas of honour and mine Spatter said he seem to be widely different I have had the satisfaction of telling him openly my sentiments of his conduct and if they anger him he  may have recourse to whatever measure he pleases I shall not call further upon  him  if he calls upon  me  it will not meet my attention if he attacks me I trust I shall have spirit enough to defend myself I have done it in my life more than once But I am proud to say I should be afraid to seek the life of another nor would I but in a case of absolute necessity rush myself into the presence of my Maker from the consequence of an act that admits of no repentance and leave my survivor only the bitterest remorse    Well upon the whole said Spatter I don't know but your philosophy may be right when he cools he'll  be ashamed of his behaviour and I'll take care to let his friends know that his proposal has been rejected don't I merit now your confidence for this Come tell me her name it shall go no further upon my soul it shan't    No said Ramble that would be so like taking revenge besides as I know you hate to be burthened with secrets I will not trouble you with this  CHAP XXV  RAMBLE finding a want of money and learning that he was indebted to Miss Trevor for his release thought it necessary to apply to some person capable of accommodating him with the loan of l He was recommended to Grumble the attorney as a man in the habit of accommodating gentlement with money He went to this man's house and found him seated in an easy chair with his leg wrapped up and rested on a stool as having the gout Ramble acquainted him with this business and produced a mortgagedeed of an estate  of l a year on which his father had lent a neighbour l Grumble looking on the parchment said  he deemed it sufficient and was happy in an opportunity of letting  him  have the money immediately as a friend of his a merchant of Liverpool whose business he did in the moneyway was just arrived with a parcel and had been with him to enquire whether he could dispose of any of it to advantage and on his telling him he could was gone to fetch it He is a man continued Grumble that I do a great deal of business for and loving his money as his life would not employ me if he did not think himself safe in my hands I have in my time  done many a score thousand for him he is one of the richest men in Liverpool Indeed I wonder he prospers so well considering the traffic he is engaged in that of bartering for human slesh    I think said Ramble I know the man    Not unlikely returned Grumble his name is Raspe    Has not he an only child and daughter    He has and she is in town with him As I find you know something of him I can bring you together I expect his return every minute  Ramble begged to be excused from this saying  Though he knows my family I think it would be better not to mention my name lest he should  start some objections for he is a very whin sical man    Well well said Grumble there is no occasion to mention names for he always rests satisfied with me  Scarce were these words uttered when Grumble's clerk entered the room and said Mr Raspe was without and a young lady with him Ramble begged leave to retire into the next room He no sooner had retired than Mr Raspe and his daughter entered  Nothing but gout here said Raspe perhaps it is catching I am afraid to come in I suppose your clerk's got the gout too he was so long delivering the messagehe kept me half an hour waiting and was at last forced  to come in without introduction    I can't get up said Grumble you must excuse me    Old sins Master Grumble returned Raspe old sinsgout follows closeI have brought the money dispatch me as soon as possible I have but little time to spare    I presume said Grumble that young lady is your daughter    Yes answered Raspe she is my daughter I always take her with me good fortunes are soon run away with I therefore never lose sight of her  Grumble begged them to be seated but no chairs being in the room except the one he sat in nothing but two high deskstools Raspe who was a short  man said  he could not reach the stool  Grumble requested Miss to ring the bell saying  his clerk should fetch one out of the next room    No no returned Raspe he'll be a long time about it  and turning to his daughter bad her fetch one Miss Raspe going into the next room to fetch a chair discovered Ramble She flew into his arms with joy and surprise and meeting him where she so little expected it almost overcome her She had not time then to speak to him but took a chair and faid she would contrive to return Upon her entering the room where her father was she found him and his attorney engaged in business Miss Raspe interrupted  them by observing to Mr Grumble what a fine collection of pictures he had and with his leave whilst they were adjusting their business she would go and look and them  Aye aye said Raspe Charlotte loves paintings her father hates them  Miss Raspe went into the next room again fastening the door after her She now told the Colonel  that they had been in London more than a week that she had unfortunately lost the directions he had given her and was quite unhappy on the account of it and considered this accidental meeting as an act of Providence  She acquainted Ramble that it would be still some weeks before they should set  off for Paris that they were at her uncle's Sir Raby Raspe's and should there continue whilst in London got a direction where to convey a letter to the Colonel and assured him she would contrive some method of seeing him in a day or two and would let him know it by a line and was sorry the time supposed for looking over a few pictures would not admit of her saying more to him at present Her father in the next room upon Grumble's assuring him his daughter was a fine girl and that he could not be too careful of her told him he had sent her to Scotland to be out of the way of the men that he went a month since to fetch her and found a damned redcoated fellow  under the same roof a man whom they called Coloned Ramble that he brought her away just in the nick of time that a day longer would have lost her that he left her fellow behind that thank Heaven he had nothing to fear now as the was going to take her abroad and would not see her again in a hurry Grumble who was convinced now that the redcoated fellow alluded to could only be Colonel Ramble in the next room seemed to enjoy the thought of the young couple meeting so opportunely He had in his days been of an intriguing disposition himself was mortified to find that age and infirmity put a stop to his career He therefore prolonged the conversation  as much as he could to give the Colonel more time to spend with Miss Raspe Grumble observed that it was not a bad plan to take a pretty girl with a good fortune out of the way of danger  Well said Raspe I must be gone  and hallooed out for his daughter Grumble would gladly have detained him a little longer by telling him he had an immediate opportunity for placing out a l of his money on very good security but Raspe was impatient to be gone desiring him to acquaint him by letter with what he had done Miss Raspe now reentered the room smiling and told her papa he would have been delighted if he had seen what she had in the next  room Such figures says she such attitudesGrumble said there was one original worth half the best pictures  of the age and I perceive Miss Raspe has made no difficulty of distinguishing it    Original or no original returns Raspe I would not cross the threshold to see thousands of them Come Charlotte let's be gone    I must papa take another peep and then  On this she opened the door bid the Colonel adieu with a speaking eye and then accompanied her father home The Colonel now reentered to Grumble got from him the cash and an account of what passed between him and Raspe was not a little pleased with the accident  that brought him and Miss Raspe so unexpectedly together and diverted at the idea that Raspe with all his eyes should furnish him with money to elope with his own daughter  CHAP XXVI  LADY Dashit having sent to request that Spatter would call upon her the first time he came her way he lost no time upon the occasion but waited on her ladyship very soon after when together and in private after a little general conversation she begged leave  to ask him  Whether he knew Sir Thomas Flam    Perfectly well Madam replied he perfectly well not to know  him  would be to argue myself unknown there is scarce a titled man in the kingdom that I don't personally know the different clubs I belong to my connections all lead to this knowledge    He has I understand said Lady Dashit an estate of l a year in the neighbourhood of York    Oh yes returned he the  Flam's  of Yorkshire every one knows    How much asks Lady Dashit do you suppose his estate amounts to    I don't know indeed returned Spatter the exact rental but I apprehend it must  considerably above the sum your ladyship mentions  She asked again  What may be the name of his estate  Spatter all confusion at these questions and not willing to be caught in a lye and yet not to be known to a baronet were things he could not digest feigning therefore forgetfulness  Name of his estate Ma'am name of his estatebless me I shall forget my own name presentlyI don't think of it at this moment but I have spent many a cheerful day with him    Then I presume said her ladyship you are personally acquainted with him    Personally answered Spatter  Lady Dashit fearful they might not both  mean the same person observed  that Sir Thomas was a tall elegant well made man    Yes yes Madam returns Spatter with a quick reply Flam's a fine fellow  and dreading with this inquisitive woman he should soon get gravelled for till now he had never heard of one of the name determined to be off Looking therefore at his watch he cries  Bless me it is near three o'clock and I promised to be at Lady Swallows precisely as the clock struck  and upon her Lady Dashit's noticing that he was a very exact man he with his usual flow of spirits happy in having got rid of the disagreeable subject continued  I was always reckoned  so Ma'am I pride myself upon it Punctuality and truth ever go hand in hand with me Miss Blossom calls me an oracle Lady Bab a timepiece and Mrs Driveit a regulator I am very sorry to leave you but her ladyship will be all impatience and I would not lose my reputation with Lady Swallow upon any account Gadso Lady Dashit I shall forget  myself  presently I must tell you a little anecdote however of Miss Sneak before I leave you You know that she lives as an humble friend with Lady Di Snapit her Ladyship you know is very fond of books or at least pretends to be so but whether she is or not is of little  moment it being no concern of mine I speak only as I hear And this affected penchant for literature leads her to notice those of her acquaintance most who seem to have a smattering for reading this being remarked by Miss Sneak who you know Ma'am is of the wrong side of thirty and whose education had been neglected in the younger part of her life and being desirous of rising in the favour of Lady Di was determined to study hard in hopes of gaining Lady Di's affection she mentioned this to her ladyship requesting her at the same time that she would lend her a book to begin Lady Di who took a pride in  mortifying those she had under her command and happy in laughing at the expence of her dependents applauded her design and promised to lend her one of the most useful books in her library It was a French and English Dictionary Some days after her ladyship asked Miss Sneak how she liked the book Infinitely replied she it is the most delightful book I ever saw the sentences are all short and easily understood and the letters charmighly ranged in ranks like soldiers on the parade whereas in some other books which I have seen they are mighled together in a confused manner like a mere mob so that there is no pleasure  in looking at them and very difficult to know what they mean Indeed I am no longer surprised at the satisfaction your ladyship takes in studyBut commend me to the divine Miss Trevor  He was no sooner gone than Lady Dashit recollected having read this story in some book which Spatter had been pleased to give to Lady Snapit but no matter her thoughts were upon Sir Thomas Flam and as Mr Spatter knew his family her doubts respecting him were done away  CHAP XXVII  FLINT having made his master acquainted with what he had seen at Lady Dashit's and the scheme laid by Mr Dangle's servant to marry her under a feigned character Ramble not willing to stir in the business himself lest Flint should be wrong in his story told him if he was not mistaken in the man to go to Lady Dashit's see her ladyship and make der acquainted with it in the best way he could but on no account to mention his name in it  Flint could not have been sent on a  more agreeable errand He had a sneaking kindness for Bridget and was happy in an opportunity of seeing her He posted therefore to the housebeing admitced and meeting her in an antichamber cries  Hearkee Mrs BridgetI think they call you the chambermaids always in the secrets of their mistresses    Do you imagine I shall answer you that question replied Bridget    Why not honey returned Flint I've a little matter d'ye see to communicate to Lady Dashit through you and that more nearly concerns her than she would wish to think  Well come said Bridget what is  it    What is it my jewel replied Flint That's too home a question to be answered d'ye see without some little preface to it We soldiers never fire without a make readypresent You must first swear honey never to divulge it to any creature living    Then how said Bridget can you communicate what you have to say to my Lady through  me  if I am not to tell it    Why by my fait that's true returned FlintI did not tink of that Well then child you must swear not to tell it to any body else  Bridget all impatience  Well I do swear I will notCome let's have it for a chambermaid you know is all  curiosity    That answered Flint is true again but for the oath now d'ye see honey a military oath is always taken by kissing the sword and as we have no sword here why you maykiss  me  and took hold of her upon which she struggling to get from him said  indeed Mr Monster I shan't    But indeed Maistress Baggage said Flint you shall  and kissing her "by my soul said he to himself its as good as a dram in a cold frosty morningit has warmed me all over  Why looking at Bridget d'ye see my charming chambermaid oaths must be voluntary or they are not binding therefore kiss me of your own accord    Don't  be a fool Flint said Bridget if you have any thing to say say it if not I'll stay no longer    Well then said Flint I'll tell you You must know my dear Mrs Bridget when my late maister and I were at the siege of Trincomaleè Damme it was warm work that dayand we fought it foot by foot I believe if it had not been for us the place would not have been carried  Here Bridget again interrupted him with  What have I to do with all this What's the  secret  you have to tell me    Why child the secret will come presently answered Flint I must lay the train before I can spring the mineat this same siege of Trincomaleè  it was there I lost my eye I shall never forget itWell it was lost in a good cause and wiping the other as though crying I don't lamen it    Come said Bridget in a consoling accent don't be cast down Flintit gives you a soldierlike fierceness that you would not have without it    Cast down No by my fait Flint was never yet cast down returned he the eye that's left it's true dropped a tear at the remembrance of parting with an old friendthat's all no no Flint will never regret the loss of an eye when his country calls for it It might have been my life What then Nothing It's a call of service  and I obey Flint's afraid of nothing but dishonour and disgrace    Well but Corporal said Bridget you're not come to the secret yet  Still Flint went on  I told you I believe that my maister and I fought it foot by foot  and here Flint brandished his stick with an affected air  and when the walls gave way and we mounted the breach an officer in a private's uniform opposed our entrance I levelled my piece at him thus levelled his stick and would have laid him flat but my maister checked me "Return your arms Flint says hehe is an officer you may always know a jontleman by his manner" I remember  it as well as if it was but yesterday you may always know a jontleman by his manner    And what said Bridget is all this to me    Don't be in a hurry honey now the secret's coming says Flint but you must swear again  and offered to kiss her  I'll swear no more whether you tell me or not  returned Bridget with some warmth Here Flint paused a little as if musing and then repeated  you may always know a jontleman by his manner Do you suppose now my dear little curtain duster that this Sir Thomas Flam as he calls himself is a jontleman    Certainly I do  says Bridget with some emotion fearing  they were discovered  Don't believe it don't believe it returned Flint he's no more a jontleman than you are a prudeyou may always know a jontleman by his mannerhe has no more degnity than a baboon He goes off like a flash in the pan fitz  imitating the sound with his voice  All men Flint said Bridget are not alike some have more degnity as you call it than others witness yourself They gain it often by accident the loss of that eye has made you look twice the man you would otherwise have looked    None of your flings Mrs Bridget none of your flings at  me  returned  Flint have a care not to raise the lion I tell you Sir Thomas Flam is an imposter I know him he is Mr Dangle's servant and if a lady had not been present I would have kicked him out of the house  Here Bridget was much disconcerted but thought she if I can but persuade him to hold his tongue till the marriage takes place he may then tell it as soon as he will and turning round to Flint  But are you sure you're right said she  Sure as a riflebarrel  returned he  An impudent scoundrel says Bridget Well Mr Flint I am much obliged to you for the discovery and shall acquaint my Lady with it but as it will be best to  punish him publickly I must beg you to keep it a secret till an opportunity offers to expose him when many are by    That replied he will be a good joke faityou may rely upon Flint    Swear it said Bridget    I do by these sweet lips I do  And here he found no difficulty to kiss Mrs Bridget who knew her only chance was to keep this fellow silent Flint asked her when this same Sir Thomas Flam would be here again  In a few days said Bridget When we have laid the plan I will send you word and till then good bye to you  Flint took himself off with Leave him but to little Flint and  he'll bring him to a courtmartial and piquet him  CHAP XXVIII  RAMBLE now received a letter from Miss Raspe saying that her father was determined to set out as the next day for Paris That he had kept her in the dark till about two hours ago that she had tried various means to prevail on him to stay a few days longer but nothing would do till at last she could only gain one day in order to have her teeth set to rights  by a dentist which she thought a very necessary step as they might not have so good an opportunity again between London and Florence that this had effected the business that he had consented to her sending for a dentist the next morning and would stay a day longer on that account She wished the Colonel would therefore disguise himself as a dentist personate an old Frenchman speaking broken English introduce himself as Dr Snag and be with her at eleven in the morning and she flattered herself she should then have an opportunity of adjusting what was necessary before they left London  Ramble did not very well like this scheme but the time being short he had no alternative he procured a scarlet roquelaure a bag of instruments and typewig painted his face and set off the next morning on this awkward piece of enterprize When he arrived at the house he was introduced into the room where Mr Raspe seemed engaged Raspe hearing he was a Frenchman and concluding he could enter into no conversation and indeed he was so disguised as to have all the appearance of a Frenchman rang the bell for a servant sent him for his daughter made a motion with his hand as desiring him to be seated and then proceeded on what he was about  which seemed to be reading letters and calculating respecting the SlaveTrade for he was talking to himself and reckoning on his fingers All Ramble could hear him say was WestIndia markets overstockedbad piece of business thisbetter throw the slaves overboard than sell them under price keeep them long they'll eat their heads off Miss Raspe now came into the room  Charlotte the dentist waits for you said he I shall leave you to yourselves my teeth want a little doctering when he has  performed  upon you he shall do the same with met  He was no sooner gone than Miss bolted the door and the Colonel threw off his cloak and laid  his instruments down gave her a thousand thank for this wellcontrived interview but feared there would be nomeans of getting her away till they reached Paris Miss Raspe was of the same opinion particularly as their stay in London would would be so short Ramble said it was of no great moment that a few more miles would make little difference  Not said Miss Raspe unless we lose sight of each other  Ramble answered  that will be impossible unless he could travel in the clouds every thing seems in a fair way Had an opportunity even offered I could not have embraced it a few days ago being in want cash but now I am provided  Nothing even in love is to be done without money the wheels will not turn the horses will not gallop nor will the driver start Be assured I will watch your father's motions for having my dear angel so great an object in view I will never lose sight of it  During this interview they were allowed time enought to settle their plan of future proceedings She could not acquaint him with the house they should be at in Paris as her father would not inform her but it was settled that she should let him know by a line sent to the English Coffeehouse She said their stay there would be short that no one would travel with them but Brutus the black and  wished he would contrive to take her from thence He promised if possible to do it and seemed to make very little doubt of accomplishing it Raspe's foot being heard upon the stairs she unbolted the door and Ramble put on his cloak Raspe coming into the room and finding he had finished with his daughter sat down bad him look into his mouth and see what was wanting Ramble put on a pair of spectacles and holding up his head by the chin said  der is great deal of scurvy about dis head Gums enflammeés and vil be more voursedey shou'd be lanced  Raspe bawls out  Won't you hurt me I can't bear pain I am subject  to the toothach  Miss Raspe stood behind all this time and could not refrain from laughing at the oddity of the scence  Vat I shall do to them said Ramble vil be very bon and you vil scarce feel it but you must take care not to catch cold after it    Be quick said Raspe for I hate long jobs  Dere then  said Ramble cutting his gums all across with his lancet very deep and which bled very much Raspe jumping up with seeming pain repeated his words with great vociferation  Dere then damn the fellowwon't pay him a farthinghe's lanced me with a vengeanceout of my room Sir or I'll be the death of you    Bless  me says Miss Raspe how you bleed SirI'll fetch some water  and took that opportunity to run out Dr Snag followed her observing that it would keep him some days longer in London And Rafpe with his handkerhief to his mouth made the best of his way after them  Scarce an hour had elapsed after the Colonel had got home before he received another letter from Miss Raspe saying that her father had scolded her for sending for so ignorant a fellow had consulted his apothecary who advised him not to venture into the air till his gums were healed of course took it for granted they should stay a week longer  and would contrive to see him again before they went He took an opportunity of returning Miss Trevor the five hundred pounds she had so generously advanced for him Unwilling to take it himself least by another interview he should renew those sensations that were in some measure asleep he sent it by a friend with a letter of unfeigned gratitude  CHAP XXIX  WE must now turn our eyes to Lady Dashit Another interview with Tom had been appointed wherein it was expected she would declare her determination respecting him She had seen him several times and liked his person and manner was satisfied from Spatter's account of him that his estate could not be so little as l a year se therefore made up her mind on the business and resolved to be explicit when next he came That time was now arrived she had been given to understand he meant to wait on her that morning and that  she might not be interrupted contrived to get Miss Trevor from home Within an hour of his coming she had been long in discourse with Bridget on Miss Trevor's conduct said she was an inconsiderate girl paid very little regard to money and that her sending l to release Coloned Ramble a person she was almost a stranger to was an evident proof of it she did not doubt but she should live to see the day when she'd be a begger  Possibly said her Ladyship she may think to come in for some of mine but I'll take care into what channel mine goes Sir Thomas Flam shall have mine every shilling of it    Ah that he should answered Bridget if I  were you my lady I wonder he has not been here he generally keeps his time  Scarce had she said the word but a great knocking was heard  Perhaps this is Sir Thomas shall I go and see my lady  Consent being given she went and Lady Dashit in the interim determined to close the business at once Her words were 'I shan't stand shillyshally upon the occasion as girl's do' Tom was ushered in by Bridget and addressed Lady Dashit thus  My dear Lady Dashit I kiss your hand It seems and age since I saw you  Bridget was ordered by her lady to leave the room observing  that wench would gladly have staid and heard what we had to say Chambermaids  the most curious and inquisitive animals alive  They are like gentlemens valets cried Tom whose masters too apt to put confidence in them make them forward and impertinent mine is too much so Well now my dear Madam permit me to ask you whether you have taken the matter we were talking about into consideration I am impatient for the happy day    Perhaps too impatient Sir Thomas replied her ladyship He that weds in haste say the repents at leisure    No man returns Tom can possibly rerepent giving his hand to one of Lady Dashit's amiable qualifications andhe was going on  when unfortunately  for him Spatter who had found his way into the house and almost into the room was stopped by Bridget on the landingplace who was heard to say without  Indeed Mr Spatter you can't see my Lady now she is particularly engaged  Spatter was also heard to say  I must see her for I have news of the utmost importance to acquaint her with I shall not detain her Ladyship a minute  He was not to be put back and Bridget thinking if she opened the door and he saw a gentleman with her that he would naturally retire opened it but on so doing so far from withdrawing he pushed right into the room Tom seeing him drew back  My dear Lady Dashit I beg your pardon for this intrusion but I have a matter for your private ear that I am persuaded you would wish to knowMiss Blossom is  he was going on at a fine rate but seeing Tom stopped short saying  I thought we had been alone pray who is that gentleman    A particular friend of your's said Lady Dashit who has done me the honour of a visit  Spatter going up to Tom said  Sir I am your most obedient humble servant  then addressing himself to Lady Dashit  I have not the honour to know the gentleman but not matter what I am going to relate is no secret 'tis only that Lord Random  has returned Miss Blossom and will have nothing more to do with her  How said Lady Dashit to herself not know himThere must be something treacherous in this piece of business or Spatter must have told a lie then addressing herself to Tom said  Mr Spatter is an old acquaintance of your's Sir Thomas    I protest replied Tom I never saw the gentleman before    Mr Spatter said Lady Dashit didn't you tell me that you was personally acquainted with Sir Thomas FlamThat's Sir Thomas Flam  Bridget who was all this time in the room drew up to Tom and took an opportunity unnoticed to whisper in his ear  Brazen  it out you may be Sir Thomas Flam or Lord Flam for any thing he knows to the contrary  Spatter kept eying Tom all this time and as unwilling as either of them to be found in a lie determined to persist in it let what would be the consequence or he never should be believed again  Yes Madam said he to Lady Dashit I have the pleasure to be personally known to him but your ladyship is joking with me now this gentleman is no more Sir Thomas Flam than I am Sir Thomas Flam  Tom then drew up to Spatter angrily saying  how dare you presume to falsify my person You are discovered in a barefaced lie and now  want to bully it out then addressing Lady Dashit this man's character is too wellknown He is not acquainted with one man of fashion in ten that he boasts of being known to    That  I  can take upon me to say whispers Bridget to her lady it was but the other day he met with Lord Spangle with whom he professed an acquaintance for years and yet didn't know him  then whispering to Tom  threaten him and you'll soon get rid of him  and went out  Spatter then addressed himself to Tom  Such language as you have used to me Sir is not to be put up with  Had I a sword by my side as you have I'd let you see the length of it    Nothing replied Tom loudly but this lady's presence prevents me from treating you as you deserve  During these high words who should come in but Tom's master leading in Miss Trevor Tom thunderstruck said  My master here too Now 'tis all over They're against the door or I'd be off  He draws back seeking for an opportunity to escape  What's the matter Ma'am said Miss Trevor I thought I heard high words or I would not have intruded    It is very unpolite gentlemen said Dangle to be quarrelling in the company of a  lady  Spatter observed it was no quarrel only a warm debate about a matter of little consequence  It may be of little consequence to you gentlemen said Lady Dashit but to me it is of the greatest  Flint having been sent by his master with Rattle and Saunter to Saunter's house in order to bring something back and passing by Lady Dashit's where he saw the chair that had brought Sir Thomas Flam before gave the gentlemen a short account of what he knew and wished them to step in they as desirous as he could be of enjoying the confusion that must arise on the discovery knocked and enquired if he was not there and being  answered in the assirmative said they had business of consequence with Lady Dashit and must see her accordingly they were admitted and the door being open they entered the room during this scene Tom finding himself furrounded by his enemies endeavoured to slipaway but Flint stopped him with  Hold fast there honey I must have a little bit of talk with you before I go  Tom walks about as angry hanging his head lest he should be known to his mastèr You are come gentlemen  at a fortunate moment said Dangle Mr Spatter has contrived to get himself into a quarrel with a gentleman here upon a visit to Lady Dashit Swords were talked of and  laughing had it not been for our coming in as we did there might have been bloody work  Miss Trevor and Lady Dashit now retired to the other part of the room conversi with each other and Saunter who was of a satyrical turn observed to Dangle laughing  that if blood had been shed it would have been slaying the enemy without quarter which in my opimon said he is murder for Spatter I'll be sworn would have made no resistance but with his tongue and as a coward cannot be an honest man there must have been some foul play in Spatter  Dangle going up to Tom addresses him with  As a stranger SirHere he stopped  for he did not discover him till this moment How's this cried he my varlet of a servant dressed up in the habit of a gentleman  This was heard by the whole company Flint answered him  Yes your honour He was retreating but little Flint stopped him    Detain him said Dangle a little longer  Flint accordingly put him back takes his sword from him and mounts guard as it were over him  Mr Dangle's servant exclaims Lady Dashit then have I been duped indeed He passed himself on me said she to Dangle for a Yorkshire baronet    So I find retunred Rattle We learned the greatest part of what passed before we came in  for Flint discovered him the last visit he made to your ladyship and came now with us to acquaint you with it  Spatter's right for once said Rattle in not knowing him to be Sir Thomas Flam  At this Spatter began to triumph saying  and yet I could not obtain credit    Nay returns Saunter don't boast of your veracity I'll appeal to Rattle did not you tell me this morning Rattle of a conversation that passed between you and Spatter respecting an embarrassment he was under here in inadvertently as he was pleased to term it asserting to Lady Dashit that he was personally acquainted with Sir Thomas Flam when he was conscious there  was conscious there was no such man existing    I did answered Rattle and am happy in being here to confront him    Persidious man exclaimed Lady Dashit but I deserve it    With what propriety said Dangle to Spatter can you expect to gain credit when your whole life is made up of lies and deceit My incautious disposition led me as it has done others to entertain a favourable opinion of you But you have always represented me as a man without resolution True enought I wanted resolution to drop  you  I have at last found you out and pronounce you to be a hypocritical  gossiping liar a mischiefmaker in families the bane of society and of course ought to be shunned as a pestilence You laboured to lower me in the opinion of my friends but your artisices have been seen through and we have totally done with you  Spatter now struck down with conscious guilt applied to Saunter to make his peace with Lady Dashit and with Dangle but could not succeed he then tried Rattle but all to no purpose He applied first to one and then to another and finding them all against him and reproaching him he thought the best thing he could do was to decamp and accordingly  left the room  Next said Rattle to the satisfaction I receive in the prosperity of an  honest  man I am best pleased in the confusion of a  rascal  Having now got rid said Dangle of one rascal let's see what's to be done with the other Flint bring forward your prisoner  Flint cries  I will your honour  and marches him up  The rascal's very looks betray him said Dangle What villain was your view in all this    He wanted your honour answers Flint for him to marry Lady Dashit under false colours    It is a pity returned Dangle there is no law to punish such a miscreant as he deserves  The war is over says Rattle or we might send him for a soldier    No your honour replied Flint that would be disgracing the profession  You're right Flint returned Rattle I did not think of that    The best way said Saunter is I believe to put him into Flint's charge and let him strip him and turn him into the street    No not strip him replies Dangle to Saunter the cloathers are not mine and then to Tom let me never see your face again    Take him away Flint said Rattle    I will your honour replied Flint and when I quit him shall I give him a parting kick    Do what you will  with him said Dangle there's nothing too bad for him  At this Flint collared Tom and dragged him out with  Come along honeycome along Sir Thomas Flam come along  and the parties retired to talk the matter a little further over  The reader will pardon a refletion naturally occurring on this subject that it is the folly and weakness of some women that lays them open to such artifices and if they are entrapped it is in a snare of their own contriving and with respect to Spatter however useful or entertaining a man may render himself to his aequaintance and have his  faluts thus overlooked for a time there is no sensible man but sees throught the deceptions of a knave and will in the end set his face against him  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
