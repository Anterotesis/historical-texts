 SONGS IN THE COMIC OPERA OF Tom Thumb the Great  AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE MICROCOSM NEAR STEPHEN'SSTREET  DUBLIN ARTHUR GRUEBER  MLCCLXXX  ADDRESS to the AUDIENCE by PUNCH on the OPENING of the MICROCOSM  HUZZA my hearts our MICROCOSMIC PuppetShow  Must stand since fost'ring friends concur to prop it so  Let me be hang'd but I'm in perfect extacy  Such a bright blooming bank of the fair sex to see  So interspers'd with beaux in gay variety  That it fulfils my wish ev'n to satiety  For we tho' wooden mimies of humanity  Are not such blocks as not to feel th' urbanity  Of your obliging readiness to come to us  In our new edifice well an't it sumptuous  Are not all quondam muchcomplain'd of grievances  Amply redress'd by our wellplann'd contrivances  Have not our brains been rack'd and our poor purses drain'd  To shew that no convenience was by us restrain'd  Have we not built a cover'd way to shelter you  Where no blasts russie rains wet or funs swelter you  A green roomlucky thought where lolling at her case  STELLA may listen to her STREPHON'S flatteries  And point against his heart all her masqu'd batteries  Here may of scandalspreading prudes forget her awe  Adjust her dress balls parties drums  catera    Your entrance to our room last year was odious  But our new CORRIDOR is quite commodious  Our MICROCOSM shines with a splendid dignity  Which may defy the cavils of malignity  And flatter us with hopes of your benignity  Then on the inside many faults are mended too  Things in no puppet show 'till ours attended to  Observe in true perspective stage and gallery  Not like our former doghole squeez'd and all awry  Observe our light arrang'd in order curious  Nor to the audience or the scene injurious  Observe our highrais'd benches curv'd with symmetry  If any thinks he can outdo us he may try  Ingress and egress now are free and elegant  What more is wanting by my conscience tell I can't  Save WELCOME which I snatch this opportunity  Of giving in the name of our community  Thrice welcome  all  our lib'ral hospitality  Is not consin'd to rank alone or quality  To charms or wealthyet if we made a difference  Such surely are entitled to some preference  Our doors are shut to none except such trumpery  As never ought be seen in decent company  With that riffraff we evermore must be at war  And drive with ignominy from our Theatre  Plain folks may enter and by seated happily  Unle  s they shame themselves by dressing shabbily  DECORUM is our guide rever'd our governor  Whose welldigested laws admit no sloven here  For if a peer come like a porter jacketed  Retire he musttho' up he raise his back at it  And sorm and sume and bounce and flounce and racket it  All this may shew what studious care we have of you  Now in return one favour let us crave of you  The ladies'  caps  are risen to such enormity  That far from being a grace they're a deformity  For gauge a modern female's heightI'll venture on't  Ten guineas that her  face  is  ound the centre on't  In such a room as ours they're quite preposterous  A senseless nuisanceBut I'll not be boisterous  No  kneels  PUNCH upon his knees in all humility  Implores  you  the true patterns of civility  To lay them by when e'er you deign to visit us  'Tis for the common good I'm thus sollicitous  Do lay them by hide not each other from our view  Else 'tis indifferent whether many come or few  The kind polite compliance well would suit you all  And each would feel the condescension mutual  Turns aside still kneeling and clasping his hands  O Nature hear my pray'rsubmiss I ask your aid  To free your masterpieces from this masquerade  You form'd them perfect artless you intended them  But Frenchfrizeurs have for the worse since mended them  Why will they punish  us  who ne'er offended them  He rises and comes forward  Nought can be call'd a SHOW where nought is to be seen  Where ev'ry bodies' light some huge headrobe is in  The eye shou'd have free scope to rove ad libitum  Our scenes are fine but we in vain contribute 'em  If only to gauzecaps we can exhibit 'em  Suppose the men a fancy took to wear their hats  With the broad leaves slouch'd down enough to scare the rats  Wou'd you not think it rude and call them Savages  Who on your comforts made such horrid ravages  But they'll not dare to do itin  this  place I mean  They know there's a point I could disgrace 'em in  And of my vengeance give the clowns a specimen  Now to conclude if you bring dispositions  Vacant to harmless mirth our exhibitions  Devoid of ribaldry and malice sinister  Some food perhaps to such light mirth may minister  We our best efforts will exert to coax you here  And you will candid smile when our arch jokes you hear  You have too much good sense and are too affable  Not to laugh out at what is truly laughable  You knowthat all our pleasantries here local are  That our performances are pastimes jocular  To please the auricular organ and the ocular  But whoso comes resolved on peevish criticism  Watching to pick an hole for some flat witticism  Smartly with trite  Joe Miller  's  Jests  to tickle us  We caution him to curb his gibe ridiculous  Our stage shall be no butt to vent his jest upon  We're thorns we're thistles we shall sting if prest upon  And tho' we scorn the sneers of such witcoalheavers  Yet we have  Rowlands  ready for their  Olivers    On their defeat we will erect a grand trophy  Prizing one gen'rous plaudit from philanthrophy  More than we dread the hiss of all misanthrophy  PROLOGUE  The Curtain rising discovers  Merlin  sitting at a table covered with black a large volume inscribed with magical figures open before him after a while he shuts the book and speaks  THE spel's wound upthe mystic page I close  GNOMES to your postseach elf his station know's  Waves his wand and comes forward addressing the audience  To night the force of MAGIC skill to prove  I mean t'exhibit PUPPETS that can move  Spontaneouslynay more can speak can sing  Fightlaughmake lovein short do any thing  Endu'd with transient life for some three hours  And in contracted size with human pow'rs  They for that while with action speech and dress  Shall welcome all my friends to this recess  Shall cringe shall shrug and sprawl along the stage  Aping their brother blockheads of the age  Fear not how'er these tiny apparations  I warrant 'em of harmless dispositions  They sha'n't approach you nearer than I stand  I keep 'em under excellent command  Nor be surpriz'd at aught they say or do  They're for the time as much alive as you  An OPERA compleat they shall display  That finish'd from the heated dawn of day  The mimic visions all must fade away  Then from his wooden shall each  Sylph  retires  Leaving the senseless logto kindle fires  I scorn'd to ransack ancient  Greece  or  Rome  For fable we've enough of that at home  My subject is domestic 'tis TOM THUMB  His martial prowess CAESAR'S far exceeded  THUMB freed his countrythat was more than he did  And cou'd have won himself a crown if needed  Giants  he quell'd and  rebels  he subdu'd  Nor in his  country  's wounds his hands imbru'd  No TOM was more than  great  for he was  good    Let not his stature prejudice your mind  True worth  is to no certain  size  confin'd  The  least  may be the  greatest  of mankind  Such the bold heroe who tonight appears  He  against  Spanish Dons  and  French Monsieurs  Was fit to lead brave IRELAND'S VOLUNTEERS  With such a chieftain soon  that  valiant host  Would humble GALLIA'S and IBERIA'S boast  And drive the dastards trembling from our coast  That  gallant CORPS' insatiate thirst of FAME  Sanction'd by glorious LIBERTY'S fair name  Must drawwhat I too hope  your  joint acclaim  SONGS c  ACT I  AIR I
