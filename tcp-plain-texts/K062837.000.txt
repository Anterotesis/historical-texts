 To the Right Honourable  John  Lord  Sommers  Baron of  Evesham    My LORD  _THERE is a Pleasure in owning Obligations which it is  an Honour to have received but should I publish any Favours done me by Your Lordship I am afraid it would look more like Vanity than Gratitude  I had a very early Ambition to recommend my self to Your Lordship's Patronage which yet encreas'd in  me as I Travell'd thro' the Countries of which I here give Your Lordship some Account For whatever great Impressions an  Englishman  must have of Your Lordship they who have been conversant Abroad will find them still improved It cannot but be obvious to them that  tho' they see Your Lordship's Admirers every where they meet with very few of Your Wellwishers at  Paris  or at  Rome  And I could not but observe when I passed through most of the Protestant Governments in  Europe  that their Hopes or Fears for the Common Cause rose  or fell with Your Lordship's Interest And Authority in  England  I here present Your Lordship with the Remarks that I made in a Part of these my Travels wherein not withstanding the Variety of the Subject I am very sensible that I offer nothing New to Your  Lordship and can have no other Design in this Address than to declare that I am  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Obliged and most Obedient Humble Servant J ADDISON  PREFACE  _THERE is certainly no Place in the World where a Man may Travel with greater Pleasure and Advantage than in  Italy  One finds something more particular in the Face of the Country and more astonishing in the Works of Nature than can be met with in any other Part of  Europe  It is the great School of Musick and Painting and contains in it all the noblest Productions of Statuary and Architecture both Ancient and Modern It abounds with Cabinets of Curiosities and vast Collections of all Kinds of Antiquities No other Country in the World has such a Variety of Governments that are so different in their Constitutions and so refined in their Politicks  There is scarce any Part of the Nation that is not Famous in History nor so much as a Mountain or River that has not been the Scene of some extraordinary Action  As there are few Men that have Talents or Opportunities for examining so copious a Subject one may observe among those who have written on  Italy  that different Authors have succeeded best on different sorts of Curiosities Some have been more particular in their Accounts of Pictures Statues and Buildings some have search'd into Libraries Cabinets of Rarities and Collections of Medals as others have been wholly taken up with Inscriptions Ruins and Antiquities Among the Authors of our own Country we are obliged to the Bishop of  Salisbury  for his masterly and uncommon Observations on the Religion and Governments of  Italy    Lassels  may be useful in giving us the Names of such Writers as have treated of the several States through which he  pass'd Mr  Ray  is to be valu'd for his Observations on the Natural Productions of the Place Monsieur  Mission  has wrote a more correct Account of  Italy  in general than any before him as he particularly Excels in the Plan of the Country which he has given us in true and lively Colours  There are still several of these Topicks that are far from being exhausted as there are many new Subjects that a Traveller may find to employ himself upon For my own part as I have taken Notice of several Places and Antiquities that no Body else has spoken of so I think I have mentioned but few Things in common with others that are notei ther set in a new Light or accompany'd with different Reflections I have taken care particularly to consider the several Passages of the Ancient Poets which have any Relation to the Places or Curiosities that I met with For before I entered on my Voyage I took  care to refresh my Memory among the  Classic  Authors and to make such Collections out of them as I might afterwards have Occasion for I must confess it was not one of the least Entertainments that I met with in Travelling to examine these several Descriptions as it were upon the Spot and to compare the Natural Face of the Country with the Landskips that the Poets have given us of it However to avoid the Confusion that might arise from a Multitude of Quotations I have only cited such Verses as have given us some Image of the Place or that have something else besides the bare Name of it to recommend them  A LETTER FROM  ITALY  To the Right Honourable  Charles  Lord  Halifax  In the Year MDCCI  Salve magna parens frugum Saturnia tellus  Magna Virûm tibi res antiquae laudis et artis  Aggredior sanctos ausus recludere fontes  Vir Geo  By Mr  ADDISON  _WHILE you  my Lord  the rural Shades admire  And from  Britannia  's publick Posts retire  Nor longer her ungrateful Sons to please  For their Advantage sacrifice your Ease  Me into Foreign Realms my Fate conveys  Through Nations fruitful of Immortal Lays  Where the soft Season and inviting Clime  Conspire to trouble your Repose with rhime  For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd Eyes  Gay gilded Scenes and shining Prospects rise  Poetick Fields encompass me around  And still I seem to tread on Classic Ground  For here the Muse so oft her Harp has strung  That not a Mountain rears its Head unsung  Renown'd in Verse each shady Thicket grows  And ev'ry Stream in Heav'nly Numbers flows  How am I pleas'd to search the Hills and Woods  For rising Springs and celebrated Floods  To view the  Nar  tumultuous in his Course  And trace the smooth  Clitumnus  to his Sourse  To see the  Mincio  draw his watry Store  Through the long Windings of a fruitful Shore  And hoary  Albula  's infected Tide  O'er the warm Bed of smoaking Sulphur glide  Fir'd with a thousand Raptures I survey  Eridanus  through flow'ry Meadows stray  The King of Floods that rowling o'er the Plains  The tow'ring  Alps  of half their Moisture drains  And proudly swoln with a whole Winter's Snows  Distributes Wealth and Plenty where he flows  Sometimes misguided by the tuneful Throng  I look for Streams immortaliz'd in Song  That lost in Silence and Oblivion lye  Dumbare their Fountains and their Channels dry  Yet run for ever by the Muses Skill  And in the smooth Description murmur still  Sometimes to gentle  Tiber  I retire  And the fam'd River's empty Shores admire  That destitute of Strength derives its Course  From thrifty Urns and an unfruitful Sourse  Yet sung so often in Poetick Lays  With Scorn the  Danube  and the  Nile  surveys  So high the deathless Muse exalts her Theme  Such was the  Boin  a poor inglorious Stream  That in  Hibernian  Vales obscurely stray'd  And unobserv'd in wild  Meanders  play'd  Till by  Your  Lines and  Nassau  's Sword renown'd  Its rising Billows through the World refound  Wheree'er the Heroe's Godlike Acts can pierce  Or where the Fame of an Immortal Verse  Oh could the Muse my ravish'd Breast inspire  With Warmth like yours and raise an equal Fire  Unnumber'd Beauties in my Verse shou'd shine  And  Virgil  's  Italy  shou'd yield to mine  See how the Golden Groves around me smile  That shun the Coast of  Britain  's stormy Isle  Or when transplanted and preserv'd with Care  Curse the Cold Clime and starve in Northern Air  Here kindly Warmth their mounting Juice ferments  To nobler Tastes and more exalted Scents  Ev'n the rough Rocks with tender Myrtle bloom  And trodden Weeds send out a rich Perfume  Bear me some God to  Baja  's gentle Seats  Or cover me in  Umbria  's Green Retreats  Where Western Gales eternally reside  And all the Seasons lavish all their Pride  Blossoms and Fruits and Flowers together rise  And the whole Year in gay Confusion lies  Immortal Glories in my Mind revive  And in my Soul a thousand Passions strive  When  Rome  's exalted Beauties I descry  Magnificent in Piles of Ruin lye  An Amphitheater's amazing Height  Here fills my Eye with Terror and Delight  That on its publick Shows unpeopled  Rome    And held uncrowded Nations in its Womb  Here Pillars rough with Sculpture pierce the Skies  And here the proud Triumphal Arches rise  Where the old  Romans  deathless Acts display'd  Their base degenerate Progeny upbraid  Whole Rivers here forsake the Fields below  And wondring at their height through airy Channels flow  Still to new Scenes my wandring Muse retires  And the dumb show of breathing  Rocks  admires  Where the smooth Chissel all its Force has shown  And soften'd into Flesh the rugged Stone  In solemn Silence a Majestick Band  Heroes and Gods and  Roman  Consuls stand  Stern Tyrants whom their Cruelties renown  And Emperors in  Parian  Marble frown  While the bright Dames to whom they humbly su'd  Still show the Charms that their proud Hearts subdu'd  Fain wou'd I  Raphael  's Godlike Art rehearse  And show th' Immortal Labours in my Verse  Where from the mingled strength of Shade and Light  A new Creation rises to my Sight  Such Heav'nly Figures from his Pencil flow  So warm with Life his blended Colours glow  From Theme to Theme with secret Pleasure tost  Amidst the soft Variety I'm lost  Here pleasing Airs my ravish'd Soul confound  With circling Notes and Labyrinths of Sound  Here Domes and Temples rise in distant Views  And opening Palaces invite my Muse  How has kind Heav'n adorn'd the happy Land  And scatter'd Blessings with a wasteful Hand  But what avail her unexhausted Stores  Her blooming Mountains and her sunny Shores  With all the Gifts that Heav'n and Earth impart  The Smiles of Nature and the Charms of Art  While proud Oppression in her Vallies reigns  And Tyranny usurps her happy Plains  The poor Inhabitant beholds in vain  The red'ning Orange and the swelling Grain  Joyless he sees the growing Oils and Wines  And in the Myrtle's fragrant Shade repines  Starves in the midst of Nature's Bounty curst  And in the loaden Vineyard dies for Thirst  Oh  Liberty  thou  Goddess  Heav'nly bright  Profuse of Bliss and pregnant with Delight  Eternal Pleasures in thy Presence reign  And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton Train  Eas'd of her Load Subjection grows more light  And Poverty looks chearful in thy Sight  Thou mak'st the Gloomy face of Nature Gay  Giv'st Beauty to the Sun and Pleasure to the Day  Thee Goddess Thee  Britannia  's Isle adores  How has she oft exhausted all her Stores  How oft in Fields of Death thy Presence sought  Nor thinks the mighty Prize too dearly bought  On Foreign Mountains may the Sun refine  The Grape's soft Juice and mellow it to Wine  With Citron Groves adorn a distant Soil  And the fat Olive swell with Floods of Oil  We envy not the warmer Clime that lies  In ten Degrees of more indulgent Skies  Nor at the Coarseness of our Heav'n repine  Tho' o'er our Heads the frozen  Pleiads  shine  'Tis Liberty that Crowns  Britannia  's Isle  And makes her barren Rocks and her bleak Mountains smile  Others with tow'ring Piles may please the Sight  And in their proud aspiring Domes delight  A nicer Touch to the stretcht Canvas give  Or teach their animated  Rocks  to live  Tis  Britain  's Care to watch o'er  Europe  's Fate  And hold in Balance each contending State  To threaten bold presumptuous Kings with War  And answer her afflicted Neighbour's Pray'r  The  Dane  and  Swede  rouz'd up by fierce Alarms  Bless the Wise Conduct of her Pious Arms  Soon as her Fleets appear their Terrors cease  And all the Northern World lies hush'd in Peace  Th' ambitious  Gaul  beholds with secret Dread  Her Thunder aim'd at his aspiring Head  And fain her Godlike Sons wou'd disunite  By Foreign Gold or by Domestick Spite  But strives in vain to Conquer or Divide  Whom  Nassau  's Arms defend and Counsels guide  Fir'd with the Name which I so oft have found  The distant Climes and different Tongues resound  I bridle in my strugling Muse with Pain  That longs to launch into a bolder Strain  But I've already troubled you too long  Nor dare attempt a more advent'rous Song  My humble Verse demands a softer Theme  A painted Meadow or a purling Stream  Unfit for Heroes whom Immortal Lays  And Lines like  Virgil  's or like yours shou'd praise  MONACO GENOA c  _ON the Twelfth of  December  I set out from  Marseilles  to  Genoa  in a Tartane and arrived late at a small  French  Port called  Casses  where the next Morning we were not a little surprized to see the Mountains about the Town covered with Green Olivetrees or laid out in beautiful Gardens which gave us a great Variety of pleasing Prospects even in the Depth of Winter The most uncultivated of them produce abundance of sweet Plants as WildTime Lavender Rosemary Balme and Mirtle  We were here shown at a distance the Desarts which have been rendered so famous by the Penance of  Mary Magdalene  who after her Arrival with  Lazarus  and  Joseph  of  Arimathea  at  Marseilles  is said to have wept away the rest of her Life among these solitary Rocks and Mountains It is so Romantic a Scene that it has always probably given occasion to such Chimerical Relations for it is perhaps of this Place that  Claudian  speaks in the following Description  Est locus extremum pandit qua Gallia littus  Oceani praetentus aquis quà fertur Ulysses  Sanguine libato populum movisse Silentûm  Illic Umbrarum tenui stridore volantûm  Flebilis auditur questus simulachra coloni  Pallida defunctasque vident migrare figuras  c  Cl In Ruf L  A Place there lyes on  Gallia  's utmost Bounds  Where rising Seas insult the Fontier Grounds  Ulysses  here the Blood of Victims shed  And rais'd the pale Assembly of the Dead  Oft in the Winds is heard a plaintive Sound  Of melancholy Ghosts that hover round  The lab'ring Plowman oft with Horror spies  Thin airy Shapes that o'er the Furrows rise  A dreadful Scene and skim before his Eyes  I know there is nothing more undetermined among the Learned than the Voyage of  Vlysses  some confining it to the Mediterranean others extending it to the great Ocean and others ascribing it to a World of the Poet's own making tho' his Conversations with the Dead are generally supposed to have been in the  Narbon Gaul  Incultos adiit Laestrigonas Antiphatenque  c  Atque haec seu nostras intersunt cognita terras  Fabula sive novum dedit his Erroribus Orbem  Tib L El  Uncertain whether by the Winds convey'd  On real Seas to real Shores he stray'd  Or by the Fable driv'n from Coast to Coast  In new Imaginary Worlds was lost  The next Day we again set Sail and made the best of our way 'till we were  forced by contrary Winds into St  Remo  a very pretty Town in the  Genoese  Dominions The Front to the Sea is not large but there are a great many Houses behind it built up the Side of the Mountain to avoid the Winds and Vapours that come from Sea We here saw several Persons that in the midst of  December  had nothing over their Shoulders but their Shirts without complaining of the Cold It is certainly very lucky for the poorer sort to be born in a Place that is free from the greatest Inconvenience to which those of our Northern Nations are subject and indeed without this natural Benefit of their Climates the extream Misery and Poverty that are in most of the  Italian  Governments would be insupportable There are at St  Remo  many Plantations of Palmtrees that do not grow in other Parts of  Italy  We failed from hence directly for  Genoa  and had a fair Wind that carried us into the middle of the Gulf which is very remarkable for Tempests and Scarcity of Fish It is probable one may be the Cause of the other whether it be that the Fishermen cannot employ their Art with so much Success in so troubled a Sea or that the Fish do not care for inhabiting such stormy Waters  Atrum  Defendens pisces hyemat mare  Hor Sa li  While black with Storms the ruffled Ocean rolls  And from the Fisher's Art defends her Finny Sholes  We were forced to lye in it Two Days and our Captain thought his Ship in so great Danger that he fell upon his Knees and confessed himself to a Capuchin who was on Board with us But at last taking the Advantage of a Sidewind we were driven back in a few Hours time as far as  Monaco Lucan  has given us a Description of the Harbour that we found so very welcome to us after the great Danger we had escaped  Quaque sub Herculeo Sacratus nomine portus  Urget rupe cavâ pelagus non Corus in illum  Jus habet aut Zephyrus Solus sua littora turbat  Circius tutâ prohibet statione Monaeci  Lib  The winding Rocks a spacious Harbour frame  That from the great  Alcides  takes it Name  Fenc'd to the West and to the North it lyes  But when the Winds in Southern Quarters rise  Ships from their Anchors torn become their sport  And sudden Tempests rage within the Port  On the Promontory where the Town of  Monaco  now stands was formerly the Temple of  Hercules Monaecus  which still gives the Name to this small Principality  Aggeribus socer Alpinis atque arce Monaeci  Descendens  Virg Aen  There are but Three Towns in the Dominions of the Prince of  Monaco  The chief of them is situate on a Rock which runs out into the Sea and is well fortified by Nature It was formerly under the Protection of the  Spaniard  but not many Years since drove out the  Spanish  Garrison and received a  French  one which consists at present of Five Hundred Men paid and officer'd by the  French  King The Officer who showed me the Palace told me with a great deal of Gravity that his Master and the King of  France  amidst all the Confusions of  Europe  had ever been good Friends and Allies The Palace has handsome Apartments that are many of them hung with Pictures of the reigning Beauties in the Court of  France  But the best of the Furniture was at  Rome  where the Prince of  Monaco  resided at that time Ambassador We here took a little Boat to creep along the Seashore as far as  Genoa  but at  Savona  finding the Sea too rough we were forced to make the best of our way by Land over very rugged Mountains and Precipices For this Road is much more difficult than that over Mount  Cennis  The  Genoese  are esteemed extremely Cunning Industrious and inur'd to Hardship above the rest of the  Italians  which was likewise the Character of the old  Ligurians  And indeed it is no wonder while the Barrenness of their Country continues that the Manners of the Inhabitants do not change Since there is nothing makes Men sharper and sets their Hands and Wits more at work than Want The  Italian  Proverb says of the  Genoese  that they have a Sea without Fish Land without Trees and Men without Faith The Character the  Latin  Poets have given of them is not much different  Assuetumque malo Ligurem  Virg G  The hard  Ligurians  a laborious kind  Pernix Ligur  Sil It L  Fallaces Ligures  Aus Eid  Apenninicolae bellator filius Auni  Haud Ligurum extremus dum fallere fata finebant  Aen  Yet like a true  Ligurian  born to cheat  At least while Fortune favour'd his Deceit  Vane Ligur frustraque animis elate superbis  Nequicquam patrias tentasti Lubricus artes  Id  Vain Fool and Coward cries the lofty Maid  Caught in the Train which thou thy self hast laid  On others practise thy  Ligurian  Arts  Thin Stratagems and Tricks of little Hearts  Are lost on me nor shalt thou safe retire  With vaunting Lies to thy fallacious Sire  Dryden  There are a great many beautiful Palaces standing along the Seashore on both sides of  Genoa  which make the Town appear  much longer than it is to those that fail by it The City it self makes the noblest Show of any in the World The Houses are most of them painted on the Outside so that they look extreamly gay and lively besides that they are esteemed the highest in  Europe  and stand very thick together The NewStreet is a double Range of Palaces from one end to the other built with an excellent Fancy and fit for the greatest Princes to inhabit I cannot however be reconciled to their manner of Painting several of the  Genoese  Houses Figures Perspectives or Pieces of History are certainly very ornamental as they are drawn on many of the Walls that would otherwise look too naked and uniform without them But instead of these one often sees the Front of a Palace covered with painted Pillars of different Orders If these were so many true Columns of Marble set in their proper Architecture they would certainly very much adorn the Places where they stand but as they are now they only shew us that there is something wanting and that the Palace which without these Counterfeit Pillars would be beautiful in its kind might have been more perfect by the Addition of such as are real The Front of the  Villa Imperiale  at a Mile  distance from  Genoa  without any thing of this Paint upon it consists of a  Doric  and  Corinthian  Row of Pillars and is much the handsomest of any I there saw The Duke of  Doria  's Palace has the best Outside of any in  Genoa  as that of  Durazzo  is the best furnished within There is one Room in the first that is hung with Tapestry in which are wrought the Figures of the great Persons that the Family has produced as perhaps there is no House in  Europe  that can show a longer Line of Heroes that have still acted for the Good of their Country  Andrew Doria  has a Statue erected to him at the Entrance of the Doge's Palace with the glorious Title of Deliverer of the Commonwealth and one of his Family another that calls him its Preserver In the Doge's Palace are the Rooms where the great and little Council with the Two Colleges hold their Assemblies but as the State of  Genoa  is very poor tho' several of its Members are extreamly rich so one may observe infinitely more Splendor and Magnificence in particular Persons Houses than in those that belong to the Publick But we find in most of the States of  Europe  that the People show the greatest Marks of Poverty where  the Governors live in the greatest Magnificence The Churches are very fine particularly that of the Annunciation which looks wonderfully beautiful in the Inside all but one Corner of it being covered with Statues Gilding and Paint A Man would expect in so very ancient a Town of  Italy  to find some considerable Antiquities but all they have to show of this Nature is an old  Rostrum  of a  Roman  Ship that stands over the Door of their Arsenal It is not above a Foot long and perhaps would never have been thought the Beak of a Ship had not it been found in so probable a Place as the Haven It is all of Iron fashioned at the End like a Boar's Head as I have seen it represented on Medals and on the  Columna Rostrata  in  Rome  I saw at  Genoa  Signior  Micconi  's famous Collection of Shells which as Father  Buonani  the Jefuite has since told me is one of the best in  Italy  I know nothing more remarkable in the Government of  Genoa  than the Bank of St  George  made up of such Branches of the Revenues as have been set apart and appropriated to the discharging of several Sums that have been borrowed from private Persons during the Exigencies of the Commonwealth  Whatever Inconveniencies the State has laboured under they have never entertained a Thought of violating the Publick Credit or of alienating any Part of these Revenues to other Uses than to what they have been thus assigned The Administration of this Bank is for Life and partly in the Hands of the chief Citizens which gives them a great Authority in the State and a powerful Influence over the common people This Bank is generally thought the greatest Load on the  Genoese  and the Managers of it have been represented as a second kind of Senate that break the Uniformity of Government and destroy in some measure the Fundamental Constitution of the State It is however very certain that the People reap no small Advantages from it as it distributes the Power among more particular Members of the Republick and gives the Commons a Figure So that it is no small Check upon the Aristocracy and may be one Reason why the  Genoese  Senate carries it with greater Moderation towards their Subjects than the  Venetian  It would have been well for the Republick of  Genoa  if she had followed the Example of her Sister of  Venice  in not  permitting her Nobles to make any Purchase of Lands or Houses in the Dominions of a Foreign Prince For at present the Greatest among the  Genoese  are in part Subjects to the Monarchy of  Spain  by reason of their Estates that lye in the Kingdom of  Naples  The  Spaniards  Tax them very high upon occasion and are so sensible of the Advantage this gives them over the Republick that they will not suffer a  Neapolitan  to buy the Lands of a  Genoese  who must find a Purchaser among his own Countrymen if he has a Mind to sell For this Reason as well as on Account of the great Sums of Mony which the  Spaniard  owes the  Genoese  they are under a Necessity at present of being in the Interest of the  French  and would probably continue so tho' all the other States of  Italy  entered into a League against them  Genoa  is not yet secure from a Bombardment tho' it is not so exposed as formerly for since the Insult of the  French  they have built a Mole with some little Ports and have provided themselves with long Guns and Mortars It is easie for those that are strong at Sea to bring them to what Terms they pleafe for having but very little Arable Land they are forced to  fetch all their Corn from  Naples    Sicily  and other Foreign Countries except what comes to them from  Lombardy  which probably goes another way whilst it furnishes Two great Armies with Provisions Their Fleet that formerly gained so many Victories over the  Saracens    Pisans    Venetians    Turks  and  Spaniards  that made them Masters of  Crete    Sardinia    Majorca    Minorca    Negrepont    Lesbos    Malta  that settled them in  Scio    Smyrna    Achaia    Theodosia  and several Towns on the Eastern Confines of  Europe  is now reduced to Six Gallies When they had made an Addition of but Four new ones the King of  France  sent his Orders to suppress them telling the Republick at the same time that he knew very well how many they had Occasion for This little Fleet serves only to fetch them Wine and Corn and to give their Ladies an Airing in the Summerseason The Republick of  Genoa  has a Crown and Scepter for its Doge by reason of their Conquest of  Corsica  where there was formerly a  Saracen  King This indeed gives their Ambassadors a more honourable Reception at some Courts but at the same time may teach their People to have a mean Notion of their own  Form of Government and is a tacit Acknowledgment that Monarchy is the more honourable The old  Romans  on the contrary made use of a very barbarous kind of Politicks to inspire their People with a Contempt of Kings whom they treated with Infamy and dragged at the Wheels of their Triumphal Chariots  PAVIA MILAN c  FROM  Genoa  we took Chaise for  Milan  and by the way stopped at  Pavia  that was once the Metropolis of a Kingdom but is at present a poor Town We here saw the Convent of  Austin  Monks who about Three Years ago pretended to have found out the Body of the Saint that gives the Name to their Order King  Luitprand  whose Ashes are in the same Church brought hither the Corps and was very industrious to conceal it lest it might be abused by the barbarous Nations which at that time ravaged  Italy  One would therefore rather wonder that it has not been found out much earlier than that it is discovered at last The Fathers however do not yet find their Account in the Discovery they have made for there are Canons Regular who have half the same  Church in their Hands that will by no means allow it to be the Body of the Saint nor is it yet recognised by the Pope The Monks say for themselves that the very Name was written on the Urn where the Ashes lay and that in an old Record of the Convent they are said to have been interred between the very Wall and the Altar where they were taken up They have already too as the Monks told us begun to justifie themselves by Miracles At the Corner of one of the Cloisters of this Convent are bury'd the Duke of  Suffolk  and the Duke of  Lorrain  who were both killed in the famous Battel of  Pavia  Their Monument was erected to them by one  Charles Parker  an Ecclesiastic as I learned from the Inscription which I cannot omit Transcribing since I have not seen it Printed  Capto a Milite Caesare  lorum Rege in agro Pa  Feb inter alios proce  in proeli occisi sunt occubuei  llustrissimi pri  cipes F  nciscus  Lotharingiae

Suffolk  was Sir  Richard de la Poole  Brother to the Earl of  Suffolk  who was put to Death by  Henry  the Eighth In his Banishment he took upon him the Title of Duke of  Suffolk  which had been sunk in the Family ever since the Attainder of the Great Duke of  Suffolk  under the Reign of  Henry  the Sixth He fought very bravely in the Battle of  Pavia  and was magnificently Interr'd by the Duke of  Bourbon  who tho' an Enemy assisted at his Funeral in Mourning  Parker  himself is bury'd in the same Place with the following Inscription  D O M  Carolo Parchero a Morley Anglo ex Illustrissimâ

Virginis M D C XI Men Septembris  In  Pavia  is an University of Seven Colleges one of them called the College of  Borromee  very large and nearly built There is likewise a Statue in Brass of  Marcus Antoninus  on Horseback which the People of the Place call  Charles  the Fifth and some learned Men  Constantine  the Great  Pavia  is the  Ticinum  of the Ancients which took its Name from the River  Ticinus  which runs by it and is now call'd the  Tesin  This River falls into the  Po  and is excessively rapid The Bishop of  Salisbury  says that he ran down with the Stream Thirty Miles in an Hour by the help of but one Rower I do not know therefore why  Silius Italicus  has represented it as so very gentle and still a River in the beautiful Description he has given us of it  Caeruleas Ticinus aquas et Stagna vadoso  Perspicuus servat turbari nescia fundo  Ac nitidum viridi lentè trabit amne liquorem  Vix credas labi ripis tam mitis opacis  Argutos inter volucrum certamina cantus  Somniferam ducit lucenti gurgite lympham  L  Smooth and untroubled the  Ticinus  flows  And through the Chrystal Stream the shining Bottom shows  Scarce can the Sight discover if it moves  So wond'rous slow amidst the shady Groves  And tuneful Birds that warble on its Sides  Within its gloomy Banks the Limpid Liquor glides  A Poet of another Nation would not have dwelt so long upon the Clearness and Transparency of the Stream but in  Italy  one seldom sees a River that is extreamly bright and limpid most of them falling down from the Mountains that make their Waters very troubled and muddy whereas the  Tesin  is only an Outlet of that vast Lake which the  Italians  now call the  Lago Maggiore  I saw between  Pavia  and  Milan  the Convent of  Carthusians  which is very spacious and beautiful Their Church is extreamly fine and curiously adorned but of a  Gothic  Structure  I could not stay long in  Milan  without going to see the Great Church that  I had heard so much of but was never more deceived in my Expectation than at my first entering For the Front which was all I had seen of the Outside is not half finished and the Inside is so smutted with Dust and the Smoak of Lamps that neither the Marble nor the Silver nor BrassWorks show themselves to an Advantage This vast  Gothic  Pile of Building is all of Marble except the Roof which would have been of the same Matter with the rest had not its Weight rendered it improper for that part of the Building But for the Reason I have just now mentioned the Outside of the Church looks much whiter and fresher than the Inside for where the Marble is so often washed with Rains it preserves it self more beautiful and unsullyed than in those Parts that are not at all exposed to the Weather That Side of the Church indeed which faces the Tramontane Wind is much more unsightly than the rest by reason of the Dust and Smoak that are driven against it This Profusion of Marble tho' astonishing to Strangers is not very wonderful in a Country that has so many Veins of it within its Bowels But tho' the Stones are cheap the working of them is very expensive It is generally  said there are Eleven Thousand Statues about the Church but they reckon into the Account every particular Figure in the Historypieces and several little Images which make up the Equipage of those that are larger There are indeed a great Multitude of such as are bigger than the Life I reckoned above Two Hundred and Fifty on the Outside of the Church tho' I only told Three Sides of it and these are not half so thick set as they intend them The Statues are all of Marble and generally well cut but the most valuable one they have is a St  Bartholomew  newflead with his Skin hanging over his Shoulders It is esteemed worth its weight in Gold They have inscribed this Verse on the Pedestal to show the Value they have for the Workman  Non me Praxiteles sed Marcus finxit Agrati  Lest at the Sculptor doubtfully you guess  'Tis  Marc Agrati  not  Praxiteles    There is just before the Entrance of the Quire a little Subterraneous Chappel Dedicated to St  Charles Borromee  where I saw his Body in Episcopal Robes lying upon the Altar in a Shrine  of RockCrystal His Chappel is adorned with abundance of Silver Work He was but Two and Twenty Years old when he was chosen ArchBishop of  Milan  and Forty Six at his Death but made so good use of so short a time by his Works of Charity and Munificence that his Countrymen bless his Memory which is still fresh among them He was Cannonised about a Hundred Years ago and indeed if this Honour were due to any Man I think such Publickspirited Virtues may lay a juster Claim to it than a sour Retreat from Mankind a fiery Zeal against  Heterodoxies  a Set of Chimerical Visions or of Whimsical Penances which are generally the Qualifications of  Roman  Saints Miracles indeed are required of all who aspire to this Dignity because they say an Hypocrite may imitate a Saint in all other Particulars and these they attribute in great Number to him I am speaking of His Merit and the Importunity of his Countrymen procured his Canonization before the ordinary time for it is the Policy of the  Roman  Church not to allow this Honour ordinarily 'till Fifty Years after the Death of the Person who is a Candidate for it in which time it may be supposed that all his Contemporaries will be  worn out who could contradict a pretended Miracle or remember any Infirmity of the Saint One would wonder that  Roman  Catholicks who are for this kind of Worship do not generally address themselves to the Holy Apostles who have a more unquestionable Right to the Title of Saints than those of a Modern Date but these are at present quite out of Fashion in  Italy  where there is scarce a great Town which does not pay its Devotions in a more particular manner to some one of their own making This renders it very suspicious that the Interests of Particular Families Religious Orders Convents or Churches have too great a Sway in their Canonizations When I was at  Milan  I saw a Book newly published that was Dedicated to the present Head of the  Borromean  Family and entitled  A Discourse on the Humility of  Jesus Christ  and of St  Charles Borromee  The Great Church of  Milan  has Two Noble Pulpits of Brass each of them running round a large Pillar like a Gallery and supported by huge Figures of the same Metal The History of our Saviour or rather of the Blessed Virgin for it begins with her Birth and ends with her Coronation in Heaven that of  our Saviour coming in by way of  Episode  is finely cut in Marble by  Andrew Biffy  This Church is very Rich in Relicks which run up as high as  Daniel    Jonas  and  Abraham  Among the rest they show a Fragment of our Countryman  Becket  as indeed there are very few Treasuries of Relicks in  Italy  that have not a Tooth or a Bone of this Saint It would be endless to count up the Riches of Silver Gold and Precious Stones that are amass'd together in this and several other Churches of  Milan  I was told that in  Milan  there are Sixty Convents of Women Eighty of Men and Two Hundred Churches At the  Celestines  is a Picture in Fresco of the Marriage of  Cana  very much esteem'd but the Painter whether designedly or not has put Six Fingers to the Hand of one of the Figures They show the Gates of a Church that St  Ambrose  shut against the Emperor  Theodosius  as thinking him unfit to assist at Divine Service 'till he had done some extraordinary Penance for his barbarous Massacring the Inhabitants of  Thessalonica  That Emperor was however so far from being displeas'd with the Behaviour of the Saint that at his Death he committed to him the Education of his Children Several have  pick'd Splinters of Wood out of the Gates for Relicks There is a little Chappel lately reedify'd where the same Saint baptis'd St  Austin  An Inscription upon the Wall of it says that it was in this Chappel and on this Occasion that he first sung his  Te Deum  and that his great Convert answered him Verse by Verse In one of the Churches I saw a Pulpit and Confessional very finely Inlaid with  LapisLazuli  and several kinds of Marble by a Father of the Convent It is very lucky for a Religious who has so much Time on his Hands to be able to amuse himself with Works of this Nature and one often finds particular Members of Convents who have excellent Mechanical Genius's and divert themselves at leisure Hours with Painting Sculpture Architecture Gardening and several kinds of HandyCrafts Since I have mention'd Confessionals I shall set down here some Inscriptions that I have seen over them in  Roman  Catholick Countries which are all Texts of Scripture and regard either the Penitent or the Father  Abi    Ostende Te ad SacerdotemNe taceat pupilla oculi TuiIbo ad patrem meum dicam Pater peccaviSoluta erunt in CoelisRedi Anima mea in Requiem  tuamVade ne deinceps pecca Qui vos audit me

Library where to show the  Italian  Genius they have spent more Money on Pictures than on Books Among the Heads of several learned Men I met with no  Englishman  except Bishop  Fisher  whom  Henry  the Eighth put to Death for not owning his Supremacy Books are indeed the least part of the Furniture that one ordinarily goes to see in an  Italian  Library which they generally set off with Pictures Statues and other Ornaments where they can afford them after the Example of the old  Greeks  and  Romans  Plena omnia gypso  Chrysippi invenias nam perfectissimus horum  Si quis Aristotelem similem vel Pittacon emit  Et jubet archetypos pluteum servare Cleanthas  Juv S  Chrysippus'  Statue decks thy Library  Who makes his Study finest is most read  The Dolt that with an  Aristotle  's Head  Carv'd to the Life has once adorn'd his Shelf  Straight sets up for a Stagyrite himself  Tate  In an Apartment behind the Library are several Rarities often described by Travellers as  Brugeal  's Elements a Head of  Titian  by his own Hand a Manuscript in  Latin  of  Josephus  which the Bishop of  Salisbury  says was written about the Age of  Theodosius  and another of  Leonardus Vincius  which King  James  the First could not procure tho' he proffered for it Three Thousand  Spanish  Pistols It consists of Designings in Mechanism and Engineering I was shown in it a Sketch of Bombs and Mortars as they are now used Canon  Settala  's Cabinet is always shown to a Stranger among the Curiosities of  Milan  which I shall not be particular upon the Printed Account of it being common enough Among its Natural Curiosities I took particular notice of a Piece of Chrystal that enclos'd a couple of Drops which look'd like Water when they were shaken tho' perhaps they are nothing but Bubbles of Air It is such a Rarity as this that I saw at  Vendome  in  France    which they there pretend is a Tear that our Saviour shed over  Lazarus  and was gather'd up by an Angel who put it in a little Chrystal Vial and made a Present of it to  Mary Magdalene  The Famous  Pere Mabillon  is now engag'd in the Vindication of this Tear which a learned Ecclesiastic in the Neighbourhood of  Vendome  would have suppressed as a false and ridiculous Relick in a Book that he has Dedicated to his Diocesan the Bishop of  Blois  It is in the Possession of a  Benedictin  Convent which raises a considerable Revenue out of the Devotion that is paid to it and has now retained the most learned Father of their Order to write in its Defence  It was such a Curiosity as this I have mention'd that  Claudian  has celebrated in about half a Score Epigrams  Solibus indomitum glacies Alpina rigorem  Sumebat nimio jam preciosa gelu  Nec potuit toto mentiri corpore gemmam  Sed medio mansit proditor orbe latex  Auctus honor liquidi crescunt miracula saxi  Et conservatae plus meruistis aquae  Deep in the Snowy  Alpes  a Lump of Ice  By Frosts was harden'd to a mighty Price  Proof to the Sun it now securely lyes  And the warm Dogstar's hottest Rage defies  Yet still unripen'd in the Dewy Mines  Within the Ball a trembling Water shines  That through the Chrystal darts its spurious Rays  And the proud Stone's Original betrays  But common Drops when thus with Chrystal mixt  Are valu'd more than if in Rubies fixt  As I walk'd thro' one of the Streets of  Milan  I was surpriz'd to read the following Inscription concerning a Barber that had Conspir'd with the Commissary of Health and others to Poison his FellowCitizens There is a void Space where his House stood and in the midst of it a Pillar superscrib'd  Colonna Infame  The Story is told in handsom  Latin  which I shall set down as having never seen it transcrib'd  Hic ubi haec Area patens est  Surgebat olim Tonstrina  Jo' Jacobi

M Antonio Montio Senatore R Justitiae Cap Jo Baptistâ Vicecomit  The Citadel of  Milan  is thought a strong Fort in  Italy  and has held out formerly after the Conquest of the rest of the Dutchy The Governor of it is independent on the Governor of  Milan  as the  Persians  used to make the Rulers of Provinces and Fortresses of different Conditions and Interests to prevent Conspiracies  At Two Miles distance from  Milan  there stands a Building that would have been a Masterpiece in its kind had the Architect design'd it for an Artificial Echo We discharg'd a Pistol and had the Sound return'd upon us above Fifty Six times tho' the Air was very foggy The first Repetitions follow one another very thick but are heard more distinctly in proportion as they decay There are Two parallel Walls which beat the Sound back on each other 'till the Undulation is quite worn out like the several Reverberations of the same Image from two opposite LookingGlasses Father  Kircher  has taken notice of this particular Echo as Father  Bartolin  has done since in his Ingenious Discourse on Sounds The State of  Milan  is like a vast Garden surrounded by a Noble MoundWork of Rocks and Mountains Indeed if a Man considers the Face of  Italy  in general one would think that Nature had laid it out into such a Variety of States and Governments as one finds in it For as the  Alpes  at one End and the long Range of  Appenines  that passes thro' the Body of it branch out on all sides into several different Divisions they serve as so many natural Boundaries and Fortifications to the little Territories that lye among them Accordingly we find the whole Country cut into a Multitude of particular Kingdoms and Commonwealths in the oldest Accounts we have of it 'till the Power of the  Romans  like a Torrent that overflows its Banks bore down all before it and spread it self into the remotest Corners of the Nation But as this Exorbitant Power became unable to support it self we find the Government of  Italy  again broken into such a Variety of SubDivisions as naturally suits with its Situation  In the Court of  Milan  as in several others of  Italy  there are many who fall in with the Dress and Carriage of the  French  One may however observe a kind of Awkwardness in the  Italians  which easily discovers the Airs they give themselves not to be natural It is indeed very strange there should be such a  Diversity of Manners where there is so small a difference in the Air and Climate The  French  are always Open Familiar and Talkative The  Italians  on the contrary are Stiff Ceremonious and Reserved In  France  every one aims at a Gaiety and Sprightliness of Behaviour and thinks it an Accomplishment to be brisk and lively The  Italians  notwithstanding their natural Fieriness of Temper affect always to appear Sober and Sedate insomuch that one sometimes meets Young Men walking the Streets with Spectacles on their Noses that they may be thought to have impaired their Sight by much Study and seem more Grave and Judicious than their Neighbours This Difference of Manners proceeds chiefly from Difference of Education In  France  it is usual to bring their Children into Company and to cherish in them from their Infancy a kind of Forwardness and Assurance Besides that the  French  apply themselves more universally to their Exercises than any other Nation in the World so that one seldom sees a Young Gentleman in  France  that does not Fence Dance and Ride in some tolerable Perfection These Agitations of the Body do not only give them a free and easie  Carriage but have a kind of Mechanical Operation on the Mind by keeping the Animal Spirits always awake and in Motion But what contributes most to this light airy Humour of the  French  is the Free Conversation that is allowed them with their Women which does not only communicate to them a certain Vivacity of Temper but makes them endeavour after such a Behaviour as is most taking with the Sex  The  Italians  on the contrary who are excluded from making their Court this way are for recommending themselves to those they Converse with by their Gravity and Wisdom In  Spain  therefore where there are fewer Liberties of this Nature allowed there is something still more serious and composed in the manner of the Inhabitants But as Mirth is more apt to make Proselytes than Melancholy it is observed that the  Italians  have many of them for these late Years given very far into the Modes and Freedoms of the  French  which prevail more or less in the Courts of  Italy  as they lye at a smaller or greater Distance from  France  It may be here worth while to consider how it comes to pass that the Common People of  Italy  have in general so very great an Aversion  to the  French  which every Traveller cannot but be sensible of that has passed thro' the Country The most obvious Reason is certainly the great Difference that there is in the Humours and Manners of the Two Nations which always works more in the meaner sort who are not able to vanquish the Prejudices of Education than with the Nobility Besides that the  French  Humour in regard of the Liberties they take in Female Conversations and their great Ambition to Excel in all Companies is in a more particular manner very shocking to the  Italians  who are naturally Jealous and value themselves upon their great Wisdom At the same time the common People of  Italy  who run more into News and Politicks than those of other Countries have all of them something to exasperate them against the King of  France  The  Savoyards  notwithstanding the present Inclinations of their Court cannot forbear resenting the infinite Mischiefs he did them in the last War The  Milanese  and  Neapolitans  remember the many Insults he has offer'd to the House of  Austria  and particularly to their Deceased King for whom they still retain a natural kind of Honour and Affection  The  Genoese  cannot forget his Treatment of their Doge and his Bombarding their City The  Venetians  will tell you of his Leagues with the  Turks  and the  Romans  of his Threats to Pope  Innocent  the Eleventh whose Memory they adore It is true that Interest of State and Change of Circumstances may have sweetened these Reflections to the Politer sort but Impressions are not so easily worn out of the Minds of the Vulgar That however which I take to be the Principal Motive among most of the  Italians  for their favouring the  Germans  above the  French  is this that they are entirely persuaded it is for the Interest of  Italy  to have  Milan  and  Naples  rather in the Hands of the first than of the other One may generally observe that the Body of a People has juster Views for the Publick Good and pursues them with greater Uprightness than the Nobility and Gentry who have so many private Expectations and particular Interests which hang like a false Biass upon their Judgments and may possibly dispose them to sacrifice the Good of their Country to the Advancement of their own Fortunes whereas the Gross of the People can have no other Prospect in Changes and Revolutions than of Publick  Blessings that are to diffuse themselves thro' the whole State in general  To return to  Milan  I shall here set down the Description  Ausonius  has given of it among the rest of his great Cities  Et Mediolani mira omnia copia rerum  Innumerae cultaeque domus faecunda virorum  Ingenia mores laeti Tum duplice muro  Amplificata loci species populique voluptas  Circus inclusi moles cuneata Theatri  Templa Palatinaeque arces

Milan  with Plenty and with Wealth o'erflows  And num'rous Streets and cleanly Dwellings shows  The People bless'd with Nature's happy Force  Are Eloquent and Chearful in Discourse  A  Circus  and a Theatre invites  Th' unruly Mob to Races and to Fights  Moneta  consecrated Buildings grace  And the whole Town redoubled Walls embrace  Here spacious Baths and Palaces are seen  And intermingled Temples rise between  Here circling  Colonnades  the Ground enclose  And here the Marble Statues breathe in Rows  Profusely grac'd the happy Town appears  Nor  Rome  it self her beauteous Neighbour fears  BRESCIA VERONA PADUA  _FROM  Milan  we travell'd thro' a very pleasant Country to  Brescia  and by the way cross'd the River  Adda  that falls into the  Lago di Como  which  Virgil  calls the Lake  Larius  and running out at the other End loses it self at last in the  Po  which is the great Receptacle of all the Rivers of this Country The Town and Province of  Brescia  have freer Access to the Senate of  Venice  and a quicker Redress of Injuries than any other Part of their Dominions They have always a mild and prudent Governor and live much more happily than their FellowSubjects For as they were once a Part of the  Milanese  and are now on their Frontiers the  Venetians  dare not exasperate them by the  Loads they lay on other Provinces for fear of a Revolt and are forc'd to Treat them with much more Indulgence than the  Spaniards  do their Neighbours that they may have no Temptation to it  Brescia  is famous for its IronWorks A small Day's Journey more brought us to  Verona  We saw the Lake  Benacus  in our way which the  Italians  now call  Lago di Garda  It was so rough with Tempests when we pass'd by it that it brought into my Mind  Virgil  's Noble Description of it  Adde lacus tantos te Lari maxime teque  Fluctibus fremitu assurgens Benace marino  Here vex'd by Winter Storms  Benacus  raves  Confus'd with working Sands and rolling Waves  Rough and tumultuous like a Sea it lyes  So loud the Tempest roars so high the Billows rise  This Lake perfectly resembles a Sea when it is work'd up by Storms It is Thirty Five Miles in length and Twelve in breadth At the lower end of it we cross'd the  Mincio  Tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat  Mincius tenerâ praetexit arundine ripas  G  Where the slow  Mincius  through the Valley strays  Where cooling Streams invite the Flocks to drink  And Reeds defend the winding Waters Brink  Dryden  The River  Adige  runs thro'  Verona  so much is the Situation of the Town chang'd from what it was in  Silius Italicus  his Time  Verona Athesi circumflua  L  Verona  by the circling  Adige  bound  This is the only great River in  Lombardy  that does not fall into the  Po  which it must have done had it run but a little further before its entering the  Adriatic  The Rivers are all of them mention'd by  Claudian  Venetosque erectior amnes  Magnâ voce ciet Frondentibus humida ripis  Colla levant pulcher Ticinus Addua visu  Caerulus velox Athesis tardusque meatu  Mincius inque novem consurgens ora Timavus  Sexto con Hon  Venetia  's Rivers summon'd all around  Hear the loud Call and answer to the Sound  Her dropping Locks the Silver  Tessin  rears  The blue transparent  Adda  next appears  The rapid  Adige  then erects her Head  And  Mincio  rising slowly from his Bed  And last  Timavus  that with eager force  From Nine wide Mouths comes gushing to his Course  His  Larius  is doubtless an Imitation of  Virgil  's  Benacus  Umbrosâ vestit qua littus olivâ  Larius dulci mentitur Nerea fluctu  De Bel Get  The  Larius  here with Groves of Olives Crown'd  An Ocean of fresh Water spreads around  I saw at  Verona  the Famous Amphitheater that with a few Modern Reparations has all the Seats entire There is something very Noble in it tho' the high Wall and Corridors that went  round it are almost entirely ruined and the Area is quite filled up to the lower Seat which was formerly deep enough to let the Spectators see in Safety the Combats of the Wild Beasts and Gladiators Since I have  Claudian  before me I cannot forbear setting down the beautiful Description he has made of a Wild Beast newly brought from the Woods and making its first Appearance in a full Amphitheater  Ut fera quae nuper montes amisit avitos  Altorumque exul nemorum damnatur arenae  Muneribus commota ruit vir murmure contra  Hortatur nixusque genu venabula tendit  Illa pavet strepitus cuneosque erecta Theatri  Despicit tanti miratur sibila vulgi  In Ruf L  So rushes on his Foe the grisly Bear  That banish'd from the Hills and bushy Brakes  His old Hereditary Haunts forsakes  Condemn'd the cruel Rabble to delight  His angry Keeper goads him to the Fight  Bent on his Knee the Savage glares around  Scar'd with the mighty Croud's promiscuous Sound  Then rearing on his hinder Paws retires  And the vast hissing Multitude admires  There are some other Antiquities in  Verona  of which the Principal is the Ruin of a Triumphal Arch erected to  Flaminius  where one sees old  Doric  Pillars without any Pedestal or Basis as  Vitruvius  has described them I have not yet seen any Gardens in  Italy  worth taking notice of The  Italians  fall as far short of the  French  in this Particular as they excel them in their Palaces It must however be said to the Honour of the  Italians  that the  French  took from them the first Plans of their Gardens as well as of their WaterWorks so that their surpassing of them at present is to be attributed rather to the Greatness of their Riches than the Excellence of their Taste I saw the TerraceGarden of  Verona  that Travellers generally mention Among the Churches of  Verona  that of St  George  is the handsomest Its chief Ornament is the Martyrdom of the Saint drawn by  Paul Veronese  as there are many other Pictures about the Town by the same Hand A Stranger is always shown the Tomb of Pope  Lucius  who lyes buried in the Dome I saw in the same Church  a Monument erected by the Publick to one of their Bishops The Inscription says that there was between him and his Maker  Summa Necessitudo Summa Similitudo  The  Italian  Epitaphs are often more extravagant than those of other Countries as the Nation is more given to Compliment and Hyperbole From  Verona  to  Padua  we travelled thro' a very pleasant Country It is planted thick with Rows of White Mulberrytrees that furnish Food for great Quantities of Silkworms with their Leaves as the Swine and Poultry consume the Fruit The Trees themselves serve at the same time as so many Stays for their Vines which hang all along like Garlands from Tree to Tree Between the several Ranges lye Fields of Corn which in these warm Countries ripens much better among the Mulberry Shades than if it were exposed to the open Sun This was one Reason why the Inhabitants of this Country when I passed thro' it were extreamly apprehensive of seeing  Lombardy  the Seat of War which must have made miserable Havock among their Plantations for it is not here as in the Corn Fields of  Flanders  where the whole Product of the Place rises from Year to Year We arrived so late at  Vicenza    that we had not time to take a full Sight of the Place The next Day brought us to  Padua  St  Anthony  who lived about Five Hundred Years ago is the great Saint to whom they here pay their Devotions He lyes buried in the Church that is Dedicated to him at present tho' it was formerly Consecrated to the Blessed Virgin It is extreamly magnificent and very richly adorned There are narrow Clefts in the Monument that stands over him where good Catholicks rub their Beads and smell his Bones which they say have in them a natural Perfume tho' very like Apoplectic Balsom and what would make one suspect that they rub the Marble with it it is observed that the Scent is stronger in the Morning than at Night There are abundance of Inscriptions and Pictures hung up by his Votaries in several Parts of the Church For it is the way of those that are in any Signal Danger to implore his Aid and if they come off safe they call their Deliverance a Miracle and perhaps hang up the Picture or Description of it in the Church This Custom spoils the Beauty of several  Roman  Catholick Churches and often covers the Walls with wretched Daubings impertinent Inscriptions Hands  Legs and Arms of Wax with a Thousand idle Offerings of the same Nature  They sell at  Padua  the Life of St  Anthony  which is read with great Devotion the most remarkable Part of it is his Discourse to an Assembly of Fish As the Audience and Sermon are both very extraordinary I will set down the whole Passage at length  Non curando gli Heretici il suo parlare egli si come era alla riva del mare dove shocca il fiume Marecchia

sembianti di religione chinarono la testa blandiro co'l corpo quasi approvando ciò che detto havea il benedetto padre S Antonio  When the Hereticks would not regard his Preaching he betook himself to the Seashore where the River  Marecchia  disembogues it self into the Adriatic He here called the Fish together in the Name of God that they might hear his Holy Word The Fish came swimming towards him in such vast Shoals both from the Sea  and from the River that the Surface of the Water was quite covered with their Multitudes They quickly ranged themselves according to their several Species into a very beautiful Congregation and like so many rational Creatures presented themselves before him to hear the Word of God St  Antonio  was so struck with the miraculous Obedience and Submission of these poor Animals that he found a secret Sweetness distilling upon his Soul and at last addressed himself to them in the following Words  Altho' the Infinite Power and Providence of God my dearly beloved Fish discovers it self in all the Works of his Creation as in the Heavens in the Sun in the Moon and in the Stars in this lower World in Man and in other perfect Creatures nevertheless the Goodness of the Divine Majesty shines out in you more eminently and appears after a more particular manner than in any other Created Beings For notwithstanding you are comprehended under the Name of  Reptiles  partaking of a middle Nature between Stones and Beasts and Imprisoned in the Deep Abyss of Waters notwithstanding you are  tost among Billows thrown up and down by Tempests deaf to Hearing dumb to Speech and terrible to behold Notwithstanding I say these natural Disadvantages the Divine Greatness shows it self in you after a very wonderful manner In you are seen the mighty Mysteries of an Infinite Goodness The Holy Scripture has always made use of you as the Types and Shadows of some profound Sacrament  Do you think that without a Mystery the first Present that God almighty made to Man was of you O ye Fishes Do you think that without a Mystery among all Creatures and Animals which were appointed for Sacrifices you only were excepted O ye Fishes Do you think there was nothing meant by our Saviour Christ that next to the Paschal Lamb he took so much Pleasure in the Food of you O ye Fishes Do you think it was by meer Chance that when the Redeemer of the World was to pay a Tribute to  Caesar  he thought fit to find it in the Mouth of a Fish These are all of them so many Mysteries and Sacraments that oblige you in a more particular manner to the Praises of your Creator  It is from God my beloved Fish that you have received Being Life Motion and Sense It is he that has given you in Compliance with your natural Inclinations the whole World of Waters for your Habitation  It is he that has furnished it with Lodgings Chambers Caverns Grottoes and such magnificent Retirements as are not to be met with in the Seats of Kings or in the Palaces of Princes You have the Water for your Dwelling a clear transparent Element brighter than Chrystal you can see from its deepest Bottom every thing that passes on its Surface you have the Eyes of a  Lynx  or of an  Argus  you are guided by a secret and unerring Principle delighting in every thing that may be beneficial to you and avoiding every thing that may be hurtful you are carried on by a hidden Instinct to preserve your selves and to propagate your Species you obey in all your Actions Works and Motions the Dictates and Suggestions of Nature without the least Repugnancy or Contradiction  The Colds of Winter and the Heats of Summer are equally incapable of molesting you A Serene or  a clouded Sky are indifferent to you Let the Earth abound in Fruits or be cursed with Scarcity it has no Influence on your Welfare You live secure in Rains and Thunders Lightnings and Earthquakes you have no Concern in the Blossoms of Spring or in the Glowings of Summer in the Fruits of Autumn or in the Frosts of Winter You are not solicitous about Hours or Days Months or Years the Variableness of the Weather or the Change of Seasons  In what dreadful Majesty in what wonderful Power in what amazing Providence did God Almighty distinguish you among all the Species of Creatures that perished in the Universal Deluge You only were insensible of the Mischief that had laid waste the whole World  All this as I have already told you ought to inspire you with Gratitude and Praise towards the Divine Majesty that has done so great things for you granted you such particular Graces and Privileges and heaped upon you so many distinguishing Favours And since for all this you cannot employ your Tongues in the Praises of your Benefactor and are  not provided with Words to express your Gratitude make at least some Sign of Reverence bow your selves at his Name give some show of Gratitude according to the best of your Capacities express your Thanks in the most becoming manner that you are able and be not unmindful of all the Benefits he has bestowed upon you  He had no sooner done speaking but behold a Miracle The Fish as tho' they had been endued with Reason bowed down their Heads with all the Marks of a profound Humility and Devotion moving their Bodies up and down with a kind of Fondness as approving what had been spoken by the Blessed Father St  Antonio  The Legend adds that after many Hereticks who were present at the Miracle had been converted by it the Saint gave his Benediction to the Fish and dismissed them  Several other the like Stories of St  Antony  are represented about his Monument in a very fine  Basso Relievo  I could not forbear setting down the Titles given to St  Antony  in one of the Tables that hangs up to him as a Token of Gratitude from a poor Peasant who fancied the Saint had saved him from breaking his Neck  Sacratissimi pusionis Bethlehemitici  Lilio candidiori Delicio  Seraphidum soli fulgidissimo  Celsissimo sacrae sapientiae tholo  Prodigiorum

make an Offering in Wood Metal or Clay of the Part that had been afflicted with a Distemper to the Deity that delivered them I have seen I believe every  Limb of a Human Body figured in Iron or Clay which were formerly made on this Occasion among the several Collections of Antiquities that have been shown me in  Italy  The Church of St  Justina  designed by  Palladio  is the most handsom luminous disencumbered Building in the Inside that I have ever seen and is esteemed by many Artists one of the finest Works in  Italy  The long Nef consists of a Row of Five Cupola's the crossone has on each side a single Cupola deeper and broader than the others The Martyrdom of St  Justina  hangs over the Altar and is a Piece of  Paul Veronese  In the great TownHall of  Padua  stands a Stone superscribed  Lapis Vituperii  Any Debtor that will swear himself not worth Five Pound and is set by the Bailifs thrice with his bare Buttocks on this Stone in a full Hall clears himself of any farther Prosecution from his Creditors but this is a Punishment that no Body has submitted to these Four and Twenty Years The University of  Padua  is of late much more regular than it was formerly tho' it is not yet safe walking the Streets after Sunset There is at  Padua  a Manufacture of Cloth which has brought very great Revenues into the Republick At present the  English  have not only gained upon the  Venetians  in the  Levant  which used chiefly to be supplyed from this Manufacture but have great Quantities of their Cloth in  Venice  it self few of the Nobility wearing any other sort notwithstanding the Magistrate of the Pomps is obliged by his Office to see that no Body wears the Cloth of a Forreign Country Our Merchants indeed are forced to make use of some Artifice to get these Prohibited Goods into Port What they here show for the Ashes of  Livy  and  Antenor  is disregarded by the best of their own Antiquaries  The pretended Tomb of  Antenor  put me in Mind of the latter part of  Virgil  's Description which gives us the Original of  Padua  Antenor potuit mediis elapsus Achivis  Illyricos penetrare sinus atque intimae tutus  Regna Liburnorum fontem superare Timavi  Unde per ora novem vasto cum murmure montis  It mare praeruptum pelago premit arva sonanti  Hic tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit  Teucrorum genti nomen dedit armaque fixit  Troïa nunc

Channels disembogues his Waves  At length he founded  Padua  's happy Seat  And gave his  Trojans  a secure Retreat  There fix'd their Arms and there renew'd their Names  And there in quiet lyes  Dryden  From  Padua  I went down to the River  Brent  in the Ordinary Ferry which brought me in a Day's time to  Venice  VENICE  _HAving often heard  Venice  represented as one of the most defensible Cities in the World I took Care to inform my self of the Particulars in which its Strength consists And these I find are chiefly owing to its advantagious Situation for it has neither Rocks nor Fortifications near it and yet is perhaps the most impregnable Town in  Europe  It stands at least Four Miles from any part of the  Terra Firma  nor are the Shallows that lye about it ever frozen hard enough to bring over an Army from the Landside The constant Flux and Reflux of the Sea or the natural Mildness of the Climate hindering the Ice from gathering to any Thickness which is an Advantage the  Hollanders  want when they have laid all their Country under Water On the Side that is exposed to the Adriatic the Entrance is so difficult to hit that they have marked it out with several Stakes driven into the Ground which they  would not fail to cut upon the first approach of an Enemy's Fleet For this Reason they have not fortified the little Islands that lye at the Entrance to the best Advantage which might otherwise very easily command all the Passes that lead to the City from the Adriatic Nor could an ordinary Fleet with BombVessels hope to succeed against a Place that has always in its Arsenal a considerable Number of Gallies and Men of War ready to put to Sea on a very short warning If we could therefore suppose them blocked up on all sides by a Power too strong for them both by Sea and Land they would be able to defend themselves against every thing but Famine and this would not be a little mitigated by the great Quantities of Fish that their Seas abound with and that may be taken up in the midst of their very Streets which is such a natural Magazine as few other Places can boast of  Our VoyageWriters will needs have this City in great Danger of being left within an Age or two on the  Terra Firma  and represent it in such a manner as if the Sea was insensibly shrinking from it and retiring into its Channel I asked several and among the rest Father  Coronelli  the State's Geographer  of the Truth of this Particular and they all assured me that the Sea rises as high as ever tho' the great Heaps of Dirt it brings along with it are apt to choak up the Shallows but that they are in no Danger of losing the Benefit of their Situation so long as they are at the Charge of removing these Banks of Mud and Sand One may see abundance of them above the Surface of the Water scattered up and down like so many little Islands when the Tide is low and they are these that make the Entrance for Ships difficult to such as are not used to them for the deep Canals run between them which the  Venetians  are at a great Expence to keep free and open  This City stands very convenient for Commerce It has several Navigable Rivers that run up into the Body of  Italy  by which they might supply a great many Countries with Fish and other Commodities not to mention their Opportunities for the  Levant  and each side of the Adriatic But notwithstanding these Conveniencies their Trade is far from being in a flourishing Condition for many Reasons The Duties are great that are laid on Merchandises Their Nobles think it below their Quality to engage  in Traffick The Merchants who are grown Rich and able to manage great Dealings buy their Nobility and generally give over Trade Their Manufactures of Cloth Glass and Silk formerly the best in  Europe  are now excelled by those of other Countries They are tenacious of old Laws and Customs to their great Prejudice whereas a Trading Nation must be still for new Changes and Expedients as different Junctures and Emergencies arise The State is at present very sensible of this Decay in their Trade and as a Noble  Venetian  who is still a Merchant told me they will speedily find out some Method to redress it possibly by making a free Port for they look with an Evil Eye upon  Leghorne  which draws to it most of the Vessels bound for  Italy  They have hitherto been so negligent in this Particular that many think the Great Duke's Gold has had no small Influence in their Councils  Venice  has several Particulars which are not to be found in other Cities and is therefore very entertaining to a Traveller It looks at a distance like a great Town half floated by a Deluge There are Canals every where crossing it so that one may go to most Houses either  by Land or Water This is a very great Convenience to the Inhabitants for a  Gondola  with Two Oars at  Venice  is as magnificent as a Coach and Six Horses with a large Equipage in another Country besides that it makes all Carriages extreamly cheap The Streets are generally Paved with Brick or Freestone and always kept very neat for there is no Carriage not so much as a Chair that passes thro' them There is an innumerable Multitude of very handsome Bridges all of a single Arch and without any Fence on either side which would be a great Inconvenience to a City less sober than  Venice  One would indeed wonder that Drinking is so little in Vogue among the  Venetians  who are in a moist Air and a moderate Climate and have no such Diversions as Bowling Hunting Walking Riding and the like Exercises to employ them without Doors But as the Nobles are not to Converse too much with Strangers they are in no Danger of learning it and they are generally too distrustful of one another for the Freedoms that are used in such kind of Conversations There are many Noble Palaces in  Venice  Their Furniture is not commonly very Rich if we except the Pictures which are  here in greater plenty than in any other Place in  Europe  from the Hands of the best Masters of the  Lombard  School as  Titian    Paul Veronese  and  Tintoret  The last of these is in greater Esteem at  Venice  than in other Parts of  Italy  The Rooms are generally hung with Gilt Leather which they cover on extraordinary Occasions with Tapestry and Hangings of greater Value The Flooring is a kind of Red Plaister made of Brick ground to Powder and afterwards work'd into Mortar It is rubbed with Oil and makes a smooth shining and beautiful Surface These Particularities are chiefly owing to the Moisture of the Air which would have an ill Effect on other kinds of Furniture as it shows it self too visibly in many of their finest Pictures Tho' the  Venetians  are extreamly jealous of any great Fame or Merit in a living Member of their Commonwealth they never fail of giving a Man his due Parises when they are in no Danger of suffering from his Ambition For this Reason tho' there are a great many Monuments erected to such as have been Benefactors to the Republick they are generally put up after their Deaths Among the many Elogiums that are given to the Doge  Pisauro  who  had been Ambassador in  England  his Epitaph says  In Angliâ Jacobi Regis obitum mirâ calliditate celatum mirâ sagacitate rimatus priscam benevolentiam firmavit  The particular Palaces Churches and Pictures of  Venice  are enumerated in several little Books that may be bought on the Place and have been faithfully Transcribed by many VoyageWriters When I was at  Venice  they were putting out very curious Stamps of the several Edifices which are most famous for their Beauty or Magnificence The  Arsenal  of  Venice  is an Island of about three Miles round It contains all the Stores and Provisions for War that are not actually employed There are Docks for their Gallies and Men of War most of them full as well as WorkHouses for all Land and Naval Preparations That Part of it where the Arms are laid makes a great show and was indeed very extraordinary about a Hundred Years ago but at present a great part of its Furniture is grown useless There seem to be almost as many Suits of Armour as there are Guns The Swords are oldfashion'd and unwieldy in a very great Number and the FireArms fitted with Locks of little Convenience in comparison of those that are now in use The  Venetians  pretend they could set out in Case of great Necessity Thirty Men of War a Hundred Gallies and Ten Galeasses tho' I cannot conceive how they could Man a Fleet of half the number It was certainly a mighty Error in this State to affect so many Conquests on the  Terra Firma  which has only served to raise the Jealousie of the Christian Princes and about Three Hundred Years ago had like to have ended in the utter Extirpation of the Commonwealth whereas had they applyed themselves with the same Politics and Industry to the Increase of their Strength by Sea they might perhaps have had all the Islands of the  Archipelago  in their Hands and by Consequence the greatest Fleet and the most Seamen of any other State in  Europe  Besides that this would have given no Jealousie to the Princes their Neighbours who would have enjoyed their own Dominions in Peace and have been very well contented to have seen so strong a Bulwark against all the Forces and Invasions of the  Ottoman  Empire  This Republick has been much more powerful than it is at present as it is still likelier to sink than increase in its Dominions It is not impossible but the  Spaniard  may some time or other demand of them  Creme    Brescia  and  Bergame  which have been torn from the  Milanese  and in case a War should arise upon it and the  Venetians  lose a single Battel they might be beaten off the Continent in a single Summer for their Fortifications are very Inconsiderable On the other side the  Venetians  are in continual Apprehensions from the  Turk  who will certainly endeavour at the Recovery of the  Morea  as soon as the  Ottoman  Empire has recruited a little of its antient Strength They are very sensible that they had better have pushed their Conquests on the other side of the Adriatick into  Albania  for then their Territories would have lain together and have been nearer the FourtainHead to have received Succours on occasions but the  Venetians  are under Articles with the Emperor to resign into his Hands whatever they conquer of the  Turkish  Dominions that has been formerly dismembered from the Empire And having already very much dissatisfied him in the  Frioul  and  Dalmatia  they dare not think of exasperating him further The Pope disputes with them their Pretensions to the  Polesin  as the Duke of  Savoy  lays an equal Claim to the Kingdom of  Cyprus  'Tis surprising  to consider with what Heats these Two Powers have contested their Title to a Kingdom that is in the Hands of the  Turk  Among all these Difficulties the Republick will still maintain it self if Policy can prevail upon Force for it is certain the  Venetian  Senate is one of the wisest Councils in the World tho' at the same time if we believe the Reports of several that have been well versed in their Constitution a great part of their Politics is founded on Maxims which others do not think consistent with their Honour to put in practice The Preservation of the Republick is that to which all other Considerations submit To encourage Idleness and Luxury in the Nobility to cherish Ignorance and Licentiousness in the Clergy to keep alive a continual Faction in the Common People to connive at the Viciousness and Debauchery of Convents to breed Dissensions among the Nobles of the  Terra Firma  to treat a brave Man with Scorn and Infamy In short to stick at nothing for the Publick Interest are represented as the refined Parts of the  Venetian  Wisdom  Among all the Instances of their Politics there is none more admirable than  the great Secrecy that reigns in their Public Councils The Senate is generally as numerous as our House of Commons if we only reckon the sitting Members and yet carries its Resolutions so privately that they are seldom known 'till they discover themselves in the Execution It is not many Years since they had before them a great Debate concerning the Punishment of one of their Admirals which lasted a Month together and concluded in his Condemnation yet was there none of his Friends nor of those who had engaged warmly in his Defence that gave him the least Intimation of what was passing against him 'till he was actually seiz'd and in the Hands of Justice  The Noble  Venetians  think themselves equal at least to the Electors of the Empire and but one Degree below Kings for which reason they seldom travel into Foreign Countries where they must undergo the Mortification of being treated like private Gentlemen Yet it is observed of them that they discharge themselves with a great deal of Dexterity in such Embassies and Treaties as are laid on them by the Republick for their whole Lives are employed in Intrigues  of State and they naturally give themselves Airs of Kings and Princes of which the Ministers of other Nations are only the Representatives Monsieur  Amelot  reckons in his Time Two Thousand Five Hundred Nobles that had Voices in the great Council but at present I am told there are not at most Fifteen Hundred notwithstanding the Addition of many new Families since that time It is very strange that with this Advantage they are not able to keep up their Number considering that the Nobility spreads equally thro' all the Brothers and that so very few of them are destroyed by the Wars of the Republick Whether this may be imputed to the Luxury of the  Venetians  or to the ordinary Celibacy of the younger Brothers or to the last Plague which swept away many of them I know not They generally thrust the Females of their Families into Convents the better to preserve their Estates This makes the  Venetian  Nuns famous for the Liberties they allow themselves They have Opera's within their own Walls and often go out of their Bounds to meet their Admirers or they are very much misrepresented They have many of them their Lovers that converse with them daily at  the Grate and are very free to admit a Visit from a Stranger There is indeed one of the  Cornara's  that not long ago refused to see any under a Prince  The Carnaval of  Venice  is every where talked of The great Diversion of the place at that Time as well as on all other high Occasions is Masking The  Venetians  who are naturally Grave love to give into the Follies and Entertainments of such Seasons when disguised in a false Personage They are indeed under a necessity of finding out Diversions that may agree with the Nature of the Place and make some Amends for the Loss of several Pleasures which may be met with on the Continent These Disguises give Occasion to abundance of Love Adventures for there is something more intriguing in the Amours of  Venice  than in those of other Countries and I question not but the Secret History of a Carnaval would make a Collection of very diverting Novels Opera's are another great Entertainment of this Season The Poetry of them is generally as exquisitely ill as the Musick is good The Arguments are often taken from some celebrated Action of the ancient  Greeks  or  Romans  which sometimes looks ridiculous enough for who can endure to hear one of the rough  old  Romans  squeaking thro' the Mouth of an Eunuch especially when they may chuse a Subject out of Courts where Eunuchs are really Actors or represent by them any of the soft  Asiatic  Monarchs The Opera that was most in Vogue during my Stay at  Venice  was built on the following Subject  Caesar  and  Scipio  are Rivals for  Cato  's Daughter  Caesar  's first Words bid his Soldiers fly for the Enemies are upon them  Si Leva Cesare e dice a Soldati A la fugga A' lo Scampo  The Daughter gives the Preference to  Caesar  which is made the Occasion of  Cato  's Death Before he kills himself you see him withdrawn into his Library where among his Books I observed the Titles of  Plutarch  and  Tasso  After a short Soliloquy he strikes himself with the Dagger that he holds in his Hand but being interrupted by one of his Friends he stabs him for his Pains and by the Violence of the Blow unluckily breaks the Dagger on one of his Ribs so that he is forced to dispatch himself by tearing up his first Wound This last Circumstance puts me in Mind of a Contrivance in the Opera of St  Angelo  that was acted at the same time The King of the Play endeavours at a Rape but the Poet being resolved to  save his Heroine's Honour has so ordered it that the King always acts with a great CaseKnife stuck in his Girdle which the Lady snatches from him in the Struggle and so defends her self  The  Italian  Poets besides the celebrated Smoothness of their Tongue have a particular Advantage above the Writers of other Nations in the difference of their Poetical and Prose Language There are indeed Sets of Phrases that in all Countries are peculiar to the Poets but among the  Italians  there are not only Sentences but a Multitude of particular Words that never enter into common Discourse They have such a different Turn and Polishing for Poetical Use that they drop several of their Letters and appear in another Form when they come to be ranged in Verse For this Reason the  Italian  Opera seldom sinks into a Poorness of Language but amidst all the Meanness and Familiarity of the Thoughts has something beautiful and sonorous in the Expression Without this natural Advantage of the Tongue their present Poetry would appear wretchedly low and vulgar notwithstanding the many strained Allegories that are so much in use among the Writers of this Nation The  English  and  French  who always use the same Words in Verse as in ordinary Conversation are forced to raise their Language with Metaphors and Figures or by the Pompousness of the whole Phrase to wear off any Littleness that appears in the particular Parts that compose it This makes our Blank Verse where there is no Rhime to support the Expression extreamly difficult to such as are not Masters in the Tongue especially when they write on low Subjects and 'tis probably for this Reason that  Milton  has made use of such frequent Transpositions Latinisms antiquated Words and Phrases that he might the better deviate from vulgar and ordinary Expressions  The Comedies that I saw at  Venice  or indeed in any other Part of  Italy  are very indifferent and more lewd than those of other Countries Their Poets have no Notion of gentile Comedy and fall into the most filthy double Meanings imaginable when they have a Mind to make their Audience merry There is no Part generally so wretched as that of the fine Gentleman especially when he Converses with his Mistress for then the whole Dialogue is an insipid mixture of Pedantry and Romance But  'tis no wonder that the Poets of so Jealous and Reserved a Nation fail in such Conversations on the Stage as they have no Patterns of in Nature There are Four Standing Characters which enter into every Piece that comes on the Stage the  Doctor    Harlequin    Pantalone  and  Coviello  The  Doctor  's Character comprehends the whole Extent of a Pedant that with a deep Voice and a Magisterial Air breaks in upon Conversation and drives down all before him Every thing he says is backed with Quotations out of  Galen    Hippocrates    Plato    Virgil  or any Author that rises uppermost aad all Answers from his Companion are looked upon as Impertinencies or Interruptions  Harlequin  's Part is made up of Blunders and Absurdities He is to mistake one Name for another to forget his Errands to stumble over Queens and to run his Head against every Post that stands in his way This is all attended with something so Comical in the Voice and Gestures that a Man who is sensible of the Folly of the Part can hardly forbear being pleased with it  Pantalone  is generally an old Cully and  Coviello  a Sharper  I have seen a Translation of the  Cid  acted at  Bolonia  which would never  have taken had they not found a Place in it for these Buffoons All Four of them appear in Masks that are made like the old  Roman Personae  as I shall have occasion to observe in another Place The  French  and  Italians  have probably derived this Custom of shewing some of their Characters in Masks from the  Greek  and  Roman  Theater The old  Vatican Terence  has at the Head of every Scene the Figures of all the Persons that are concerned in it with the particular Disguises in which they acted and I remember to have seen in the  Villa Mattheio  an Antick Statue mask'd which was perhaps designed for  Gnatho  in the Eunuch for it agrees exactly with the Figure he makes in the  Vatican  Manuscript One would wonder indeed how so Polite a People as the ancient  Romans  and  Athenians  should not look on these borrowed Faces as unnatural They might do very well for a Cyclops or a Satyr that can have no Resemblance in Human Features but for a Flatterer a Miser or the like Characters which abound in our own Species nothing is more ridiculous than to represent their Looks by a painted Vizard In Persons of this Nature the Turns and Motions of the Face are often  as agreeable as any part of the Action Could we suppose that a Mask represented never so naturally the general Humour of a Character it can never suit with the Variety of Passions that are incident to every single Person in the whole Course of a Play The Grimace may be proper on some Occasions but is too steady to agree with all The Rabble indeed are generally pleased at the first Entry of a Disguise but the Jest grows cold even with them too when it comes on the Stage in a Second Scene  Since I am on this Subject I cannot forbear mentioning a Custom at  Venice  which they tell me is particular to the common People of this Country of singing Stanza's out of  Tasso  They are set to a pretty Solemn Tune and when one begins in any part of the Poet it is odds but he will be answered by some Body else that overhears him So that sometimes you have Ten or a Dozen in the Neighbourhood of one another taking Verse after Verse and running on with the Poem as far as their Memories will carry them  On Holy  Thursday  among the several Shows that are yearly exhibited I saw one that is odd enough and particular to the  Venetians  There is a Set  of Artisans who by the help of several Poles which they lay across each others Shoulders build themselves up into a kind of Pyramid so that you see a Pile of Men in the Air of Four or Five Rows rising one above another The Weight is so equally distributed that every Man is very well able to bear his part of it the Stories if I may so call them growing less and less as they advance higher and higher A little Boy represents the Point of the Pyramid who after a short space leaps off with a great deal of Dexterity into the Arms of one that catches him at the Bottom In the same manner the whole Building falls to pieces I have been the more particular on this because it explains the following Verses of  Claudian  which show that the  Venetians  are not the Inventors of this Trick  Vel qui mere avium sese jaculantur in auras  Corporaque aedificant celeri crescentia nexu  Quorum compositam puer augmentatus in arcem  Emicat vinctus plantae vel cruribus haerens  Pendula librato figit vestigia saltu  Claud de Pr Olyb Cons  Men pil'd on Men with active Leaps arise  And build the breathing Fabrick to the Skies  A sprightly Youth above the top most Row  Points the tall Pyramid and crowns the Show  Tho' we meet with the  Veneti  in the old Poets the City of  Venice  is too modern to find a Place among them  Sannazarius  's Epigram is too well known to be inserted The same Poet has celebrated this City in Two other Places of his Poems  Quis Venetae miracula proferat urbis  Una instar magni quae simul Orbis habet  Salve Italûm Regina altae pulcherrima Romae  Aemula quae terris quae dominaris aquis  Tu tibi vel Reges cives facis O Decus O Lux  Ausoniae per quam libera turba sumus  Per quam Barbaries nobis non imperat Sol  Exoriens nostro clarius orbe nitet  L El  Venetia  stands with Endless Beauties crown'd  And as a World within her self is found  Hail Queen of  Italy  for Years to come  The mighty Rival of Immortal  Rome    Nations and Seas are in thy States enroll'd  And Kings among thy Citizens are told  Ausonia  's brightest Ornament by Thee  She sits a Sov'raign Unenslav'd and Free  By Thee the rude Barbarian chas'd away  The Rising Sun chears with a purer Ray  Our Western World and doubly gilds the Day  Nec Tu semper eris que septem amplecteris arces  Nec Tu quae mediis aemula surgis aquis  L El  Thou too shalt fall by Time or barb'rous Foes  Whose circling Walls the Sev'n fam'd Hills enclose  And Thou whose Rival Tow'rs Invade the Skies  And from amidst the Waves with equal Glory rise  FERRARA RAVENNA RIMINI  _AT  Venice  I took a Bark for  Ferrara  and in my way thither saw several Mouths of the  Po  by which it empties it self into the Adriatic  Quo non alius per pinguia culta  In mare purpureum violentior influit amnis  Virg G  which is true if understood only of the Rivers of  Italy  Lucan  's Description of the  Po  would have been very beautiful had he known when to have given over  Quoque magis nullum tellus se solvit in amnem  Eridanus fractasque evolvit in aequora sylvas  Hesperiamque exhaurit aquis hunc fabula primum  Populeâ fiuvium ripas umbrâsse coronâ  Cumque diem pronum transverso limite ducens  Succendit Phaëton flagrantibus aethera loris  Gurgitibus raptis penitus tellure perustâ  Hunc  abuisse pares Phoebeis ignibus undas  L  The  Po  that rushing with uncommon Force  O'ersets whole Woods in its tumultuous Course  And rising from  Hesperia  's watry Veins  Th' exhausted Land of all its Moisture drains  The  Po  as sings the Fable first convey'd  Its wond'ring Current through a Poplar Shade  For when young  Phaeton  mistook his way  Lost and confounded in the Blaze of Day  This River with surviving Streams supply'd  When all the rest of the whole Earth were dry'd  And Nature's self lay ready to expire  Quench'd the dire Flame that set the World on Fire  The Poet's Reflections follow  Non minor hic Nilo si non per plana jacentis  Aegypti Libycas Nilus stagnaret arenas  Non minor hic Istro nisi quod dum permeat orbem  Ister casuros in quaelibet aequora fontes  Accipit Scythicas exit non solus in undas  Id  Nor would the  Nile  more watry Stores contain  But that he stagnates on the  Libyan  Plain  Nor would the  Danube  run with greater Force  But that he gathers in his tedious Course  Ten Thousand Streams and swelling as he flows  In  Scythian  Seas the Glut of Rivers throws  That is says  Scaliger  the  Eridanus  would be bigger than the  Nile  and  Danube  if the  Nile  and  Danube  were not bigger than the  Eridanus  What makes the Poet's Remark the more improper the very Reason why the  Danube  is greater than the  Po  as he assigns it is that which really makes the  Po  as great as it is for before its Fall into the Gulf it receives into its Channel the most considerable Rivers of  Piemont    Milan  and the rest of  Lombardy  From  Venice  to  Ancona  the Tide comes in very sensibly at its stated Periods but rises more or less in proportion as it advances nearer the Head of the Gulf  Lucan  has run out of his way to describe this  Phaenomenon  which is indeed very extraordinary to those who lye out of the Neighbourhood of the great Ocean and according to his usual Custom lets his Poem stand still that he may give way to his own Reflections  Quàque jacet littus dubium quod terra fretumque  Vendicat alternis vicibus cum funditur ingens  Oceanus vel cùm refugis se fluctibus aufert  Ventus ab extremo pelagus sic axe volutet  Destituatque ferens an sidere mota secundo  Tethyos unda vagae Lunaribus aestuet horis  Flammiger an Titan ut alentes hauriat undas  Erigat Oceanum fluctusque ad sidera tollat  Quaerite quos agitat mundi labor at mihi semper  Tu quaecunque moves tam crebros causa meatus  Ut superi voluere late  Lib  Wash'd with successive Seas the doubtful Strand  By turns is Ocean and by turns is Land  Whether the Winds in distant Regions blow  Moving the World of Waters to and fro  Or waining Moons their settled Periods keep  To swell the Billows and ferment the Deep  Or the tir'd Sun his Vigour to supply  Raises the floating Mountains to the Sky  And slakes his Thirst within the mighty Tide  Do you who study Nature's Works decide  Whilst I the dark mysterious Cause admire  Nor into what the Gods conceal presumptuously enquire  At  Ferrara  I met nothing extraordinary The Town is very large but extreamly thin of People It has a Citadel and something like a Fortification running round it but so large that it requires more Soldiers to defend it than the Pope has in his whole Dominions The Streets are as beautiful as any I have seen in their Length Breadth and Regularity The  Benedictins  have the finest  Convent of the Place They show'd us in the Church  Aristo  's Monument His Epitaph says he was  Nobilitate generis atque Animi clarus in rebus publicis administrandis in regendis populis in gravissimis summis Pontificis legationibus prudentiâ consilio eloquentiâ praestantissimus  I came down a Branch of the  Po  as far as  Alberto  within Ten Miles of  Ravenna  All this Space lyes miserably uncultivated 'till you come near  Ravenna  where the Soil is made extreamly fruitful and shows that much of the rest might be were there Hands enough to manage it to the best Advantage It is now on both sides the Road very Marshy and generally overgrown with Rushes which made me fancy it was once floated by the Sea that lyes within Four Miles of it Nor could I in the least doubt it when I saw  Ravenna  that is now almost at the same distance from the Adriatic tho' it was formerly the most famous of all the  Roman  Ports  One may guess at its ancient Situation from  Martial  's  Meliùsque Ranae garrian  Ravennates  Lib  Ravenna  's Frogs in better Musick croak  and the Description that  Silius Italicus  has given us of it  Quàque gravi remo limosis segniter undis  Lenta paludosae perscindunt stagna Ravennae  L  Encumber'd in the Mud their Oars divide  With heavy Stroaks the thick unwieldy Tide  Accordingly the old Geographers represent it as situated among Marshes and Shallows The Place which is shown for the Haven is on a Level with the Town and has probably been stopped up by the great Heaps of Dirt that the Sea has thrown into it for all the Soil on that side of  Ravenna  has been left there insensibly by the Sea's discharging it self upon it for so many Ages The Ground must have been formerly much lower for otherwise the Town would have lain under Water The Remains of the  Pharos  that stand about Three Miles from the Sea and Two from the Town have their Foundations covered with Earth for some Yards as they told me  which notwithstanding are upon a Level with the Fields that lye about them tho' 'tis probable they took the Advantage of a rising Ground to set it upon It was a square Tower of about Twelve Yards in Breadth as appears by that part of it which yet remains entire so that its Height must have been very considerable to have preserved a Proportion It is made in the Form of the  Venetian Campanello  and is probably the high Tower mentioned by  Pliny    Lib    cap    On the side of the Town where the Sea is supposed to have lain formerly there is now a little Church called the  Rotonda  At the Entrance of it are Two Stones the one with an Inscription in  Gothic  Characters that has nothing in it remarkable the other is a square Piece of Marble that by the Inscription appears ancient and by the Ornaments about it shows it self to have been a little Pagan Monument of Two Persons who were Shipwreck'd perhaps in the Place where now their Monument stands The first Line and a half that tells their Names and Families in Prose is not legible the rest runs thus  Raniae domus hos produxit alumnos  Libertatis opus contulit una Dies  Naufraga mors pariter rapuit quos junxerat antè  Et duplices luctus mors periniqua dedit  Both with the same Indulgent Master bless'd  On the same Day their Liberty possess'd  A Shipwreck slew whom it had join'd before  And left their common Friends their Fun'rals to deplore  There is a Turn in the Third Verse that we lose by not knowing the Circumstances of their Story It was the  Naufraga mors  which destroyed them as it had formerly united them what this Union was is expressed in the preceding Verse by their both having been made Freemen on the same Day If therefore we suppose they had been formerly Shipwreck'd with their Master and that he made them Free at the same time the  Epigram  is unriddled Nor is this Interpretation perhaps so forc'd as it may seem at first sight since it was the Custom of the Masters a little before their Death to give their Slaves their Freedom if they had deserv'd it at their Hands and it is natural enough  to suppose one involved in a common Shipwreck would give such of his Slaves their Liberty as should have the good Luck to save themselves The Chancel of this Church is vaulted with a single Stone of Four Foot in Thickness and a Hundred and Fourteen in Circumference There stood on the Outside of this little Cupola a great Tomb of  Porphyry  and the Statues of the Twelve Apostles but in the War that  Louis  the Twelfth made on  Italy  the Tomb was broken in pieces by a CannonBall It was perhaps the same Blow that made the Flaw in the Cupola tho' the Inhabitants say it was crack'd by Thunder that destroyed a Son of one of their  Gothic  Princes who had taken Shelter under it as having been foretold what kind of Death he was to die I asked an Abbot that was in the Church what was the Name of this  Gothic  Prince who after a little Recollection answered me That he could not tell precisely but that he thought it was one  Julius Caesar  There is a Convent of  Theatins  where they show a little Window in the Church thro' which the Holy Ghost is said to have entered in the Shape of a Dove and to have settled on one of the Candidates for the Bishoprick The  Dove is represented in the Window and in several Places of the Church and is in great Reputation all over  Italy  I should not indeed think it impossible for a Pigeon to fly in accidentally thro' the Roof where they still keep the Hole open and by its fluttering over such a particular Place to give so superstitious an Assembly an Occasion of favouring a Competitor especially if he had many Friends among the Electors that would make a politick Use of such an Accident But they pretend the Miracle has happened more than once Among the Pictures of several famous Men of their Order there is one with this Inscription  P D Thomas Gouldvellus Ep As  is  Trid  no  concilio contra Haereticos in Anglia contra Elisabet Fidei Confessor conspicuus  The Statue of  Alexander  the Seventh stands in the large Square of the Town it is cast in Brass and has the Posture that is always given the Figure of a Pope an Arm extended and blessing the People In another Square on a high Pillar is set the Statue of the blessed Virgin arrayed like a Queen with a Scepter in her Hand and a Crown upon her Head for having delivered the Town from a raging Pestilence The Custom of Crowning the Holy Virgin  is so much in Vogue among the  Italians  that one often sees in their Churches a little Tinsel Crown or perhaps a Circle of Stars glew'd to the Canvas over the Head of the Figure which sometimes spoils a good Picture In the Convent of  Benedictins  I saw Three huge Chests of Marble with no Inscription on them that I could find tho' they are said to contain the Ashes of  Valentinian    Honorius  and his Sister  Placidia  From  Ravenna  I came to  Rimini  having passed the  Rubicon  by the way This River is not so very contemptible as it is generally represented and was much increased by the melting of the Snows when  Caesar  passed it according to  Lucan  Fonte cadit modico parvisque impellitur undis  Puniceus Rubicon cum fervida canduit aestas  Perque imas serpit valles Gallica certus  Limes ab Ausoniis disterminat arva colonis  Tunc vires praebebat hyems atque auxerat undas  Tertia jam gravido pluvialis Cynthia cornu  Et madidis Euri resolutae flatibus Alpes  L  While Summer lasts the Streams of  Rubicon  From their spent Source in a small Current run  Hid in the winding Vales they gently glide  And  Italy  from neighb'ring  Gaul  divide  But now with Winter Storms encreas'd they rose  By wat'ry Moons produc'd and  Alpine  Snows  That melting on the hoary Mountains lay  And in warm Eastern Winds dissolv'd away  This River is now called  Pisatello  Rimini  has nothing modern to boast of Its Antiquities are as follow A Marble Bridge of Five Arches built by  Augustus  and  Tiberius  for the Inscription is still legible tho' not rightly transcrib'd by  Gruter  A Triumphal Arch raised by  Augustus  which makes a Noble Gate to the Town tho' part of it is ruined The Ruins of an Amphitheater The  Suggestum  on which it is said that  Julius Caesar  harangued his Army after having passed the  Rubicon  I must confess I can by no means look on this last as Authentick It is built of hewn Stone like the Pedestal of a Pillar but something higher than ordinary and is but just broad enough for one Man to stand upon it On the contrary the ancient  Suggestums  as I have often observed on Medals  as well as on  Constantine  's Arch were made of Wood like a little kind of Stage for the Heads of the Nails are sometimes represented that are supposed to have fastened the Boards together We often see on them the Emperor and Two or Three General Officers sometimes sitting and sometimes standing as they made Speeches or distributed a Congiary to the Soldiers or People They were probably always in readiness and carried among the Baggage of the Army whereas this at  Rimini  must have been built on the Place and required some time before it could be finished  IMPERATOR VIII S C  LIBERALITAS AVG S C  ADLOCVT AVG  If the Observation I have here made is just it may serve as a Confirmation to the Learned  Fabretti  's Conjecture on  Trajan  's Pillar who supposes I think with a great deal of Reason that the Camps Intrenchments and other Works  of the same Nature which are cut out as if they had been made of Brick or hewn Stone were in reality only of Earth Turf or the like Materials for there are on the Pillar some of those  Suggestums  which are figured like those on Medals with only this difference that they seem built of Brick or FreeStone At Twelve Miles distance from  Rimini  stands the little Republick of St  Marino  which I could not forbear visiting tho' it lyes out of the common Tour of Travellers and has excessively bad Ways to it I shall here give a particular Account of it because I know of no Body else that as done it One may at least have the Pleasure of seeing in it something more singular than can be found in great Governments and form from it an Idea of  Venico  in its first Beginnings when it had only a few Heaps of Earth for its Dominions or of  Rome  it self when it had as yet cover'd but one of its Seven Hills  THE REPUBLICK OF St MARINO  _THE Town and Republick of St  Marino  stands on the Top of a very high and craggy Mountain It is generally hid among the Clouds and lay under Snow when I saw it tho' it was clear and warm Weather in all the Country about it There is not a Spring or Fountain that I could hear of in the whole Dominions but they are always well provided with huge Cisterns and Reservoirs of Rain and SnowWater The Wine that grows on the sides of their Mountain is extraordinary good and I think much better than any I met with on the cold side of the  Appenines  This puts me in Mind of their Cellars which have most of 'em a natural Advantage that renders 'em extreamly cool  in the hottest Seasons for they have generally in the Sides of them deep Holes that run into the Hollows of the Hill from whence there constantly issues a breathing kind of Vapour so very chilling in the Summer time that a Man can scarce suffer his Hand in the Wind of it  This Mountain and a few neighbouring Hillocks that lye scatter'd about the Bottom of it is the whole Circuit of these Dominions They have what they call Three Castles Three Convents and Five Churches and can reckon about Five Thousand Souls in their Community The Inhabitants as well as the Historians who mention this little Republick give the following Account of its Original St  Marino  was its Founder a  Dalmatian  by Birth and by Trade a Mason He was employed above Thirteen Hundred Years ago in the Reparation of  Rimini  and after he had finish'd his Work retired to this solitary Mountain as finding it very proper for the Life of a Hermit which he led in the greatest Rigours and Austerities of Religion He had not been long here before he wrought a reputed Miracle which join'd with his extraordinary Sanctity gained him so great an Esteem that the Princess of  the Country made him a Present of the Mountain to dispose of it at his own Discretion His Reputation quickly Peopled it and gave Rise to the Republick which calls it self after his Name So that the Commonwealth of  Marino  may boast at least of a nobler Original than that of  Rome  the one having been at first an  Asylum  for Robbers and Murderers and the other a Resort of Persons eminent for their Piety and Devotion The best of their Churches is Dedicated to the Saint and holds his Ashes His Statue stands over the high Altar with the Figure of a Mountain in its Hands crown'd with Three Castles which is likewise the Arms of the Commonwealth They attribute to his Protection the long Duration of their State and look on him as the greatest Saint next the Blessed Virgin I saw in their StatuteBook a Law against such as speak disrespectfully of him who are to be punished in the same manner as those who are Convicted of Blasphemy  This petty Republick has now lasted Thirteen hundred Years while all the other States of  Italy  have several times changed their Masters and Forms of Government Their whole History is compris'd in Two Purchases which they  made of a neighbouring Prince and in a War in which they assisted the Pope against a Lord of  Rimini  In the Year they bought a Castle in the Neighbourhood as they did another in the Year The Papers of the Conditions are preserv'd in their Archives where 'tis very remarkable that the Name of the Agent for the Commonwealth of the Seller of the Notary and the Witnesses are the same in both the Instruments tho' drawn up at Seventy Years distance from each other Nor can it be any Mistake in the Date because the Popes and Emperors Names with the Year of their respective Reigns are both punctually set down About Years after this they assisted Pope  Pius  the Second against one of the  Malatesta's  who was then Lord of  Rimini  and when they had helped to conquer him received from the Pope as a Reward for their Assistance Four little Castles This they represent as the flourishing Time of the Commonwealth when their Dominions reach'd half way up a neighbouring Hill but at present they are reduced to their old Extent They would probably sell their Liberty as dear as they could to any that attacked them for there is but one Road by  which to climb up to them and they have a very severe Law against any of their own Body that enters the Town by another Path lest any new one should be worn on the Sides of their Mountain All that are capable of bearing Arms are exercis'd and ready at a Moment's Call  The Sovereign Power of the Republick was lodg'd originally in what they call the  Arengo  a great Council in which every House had its Representative But because they found too much Confusion in such a Multitude of Statesmen they devolv'd their whole Authority into the Hands of the Council of Sixty The  Arengo  however is still called together in Cases of extraordinary Importance and if after due Summons any Member absents himself he is to be Fin'd to the value of about a Penny  English  which the Statute says he shall pay  Sine aliquâ diminutione aut gratiâ  In the ordinary Course of Government the Council of Sixty which notwithstanding the Name consists but of Forty Persons has in its Hands the Administration of Affairs and is made up half out of the Noble Families and half out of the  Plebeian  They decide all by Baloting are not admitted 'till Five and Twenty  Years old and chuse the Officers of the Commonwealth  Thus far they agree with the Great Council of  Venice  but their Power is much more extended for no Sentence can stand that is not confirmed by Two Thirds of this Council Besides that no Son can be admitted into it during the Life of his Father nor Two be in it of the same Family nor any enter but by Election The chief Officers of the Commonwealth are the Two  Capitaneos  who have such a Power as the old  Roman  Consuls had but are chosen every Six Months I talk'd with some that had been  Capitaneos  Six or Seven times tho' the Office is never to be continu'd to the same Persons twice successively The Third Officer is the Commissary who judges in all Civil and Criminal Matters But because the many Alliances Friendships and Intermarriages as well as the Personal Feuds and Animosities that happen among so small a People might obstruct the Course of Justice if one of their own Number had the Distribution of it they have always a Foreigner for this Employ whom they chuse for Three Years and maintain out of the Publick Stock He must be a Doctor of Law and a Man of known Integrity He is join'd  in Commission with the  Capitaneos  and acts something like the Recorder of  London  under the Lord Mayor The Commonwealth of  Genoa  was forc'd to make use of a foreign Judge for many Years whilst their Republick was torn into the Divisions of  Guelphs  and  Gibelines  The Fourth Man in the State is the Physician who must likewise be a Stranger and is maintain'd by a publick Salary He is oblig'd to keep a Horse to visit the Sick and to inspect all Drugs that are imported He must be at least Thirty Five Years old a Doctor of the Faculty and eminent for his Religion and Honesty that his Rashness or Ignorance may not unpeople the Commonwealth And that they may not suffer long under any bad Choice he is elected only for Three Years The present Physician is a very understanding Man and well read in our Countrymen  Harvey    Willis    Sydenham  c He has been continu'd for some time among 'em and they say the Commonwealth thrives under his Hands Another Person who makes no ordinary Figure in the Republick is the SchoolMaster I scarce met with any in the Place that had not some Tincture of Learning I had the Perusal of a  Latin  Book in  Folio  Entituled  Statuta Illustrissimae Reipublicae Sancti Marini  Printed at  Rimini  by Order of the Commonwealth The Chapter on the publick Ministers says that when an Ambassador is dispatch'd from the Republick to any Foreign State he shall be allow'd out of the Treasury to the Value of a Shilling a Day The People are esteem'd very honest and rigorous in the Execution of Justice and seem to live more happy and contented among their Rocks and Snows than others of the  Italians  do in the pleasantest Vallies of the World Nothing indeed can be a greater Instance of the natural Love that Mankind has for Liberty and of their Aversion to an Arbitrary Government than such a Savage Mountain cover'd with People and the  Campania  of  Rome  which lyes in the same Country almost destitute of Inhabitants  Pesaro Fano Senigallia Ancona Loretto c To ROME  _FROM  Rimini  to  Loretto  the Towns of Note are  Pesaro    Fano    Senigallia  and  Ancona Fano  received its Name from the Fane or Temple of Fortune that stood in it One may still see the Triumphal Arch erected there to  Augustus  It is indeed very much defac'd by Time but the Plan of it as it stood entire with all its Inscriptions is neatly cut upon the Wall of a neighbouring Building In each of these Towns is a beautiful Marble Fountain where the Water runs continually thro' several little Spouts which looks very refreshing in these hot Countries and gives a great Coolness to the Air about them That of  Pesaro  is handsomly designed  Ancona  is much the most considerable  of these Towns It stands on a Promontory and looks more beautiful at a distance than when you are in it The Port was made by  Trajan  for which he has a Triumphal Arch erected to him by the Seaside The Marble of this Arch looks very white and fresh as being exposed to the Winds and Salt SeaVapours that by continually fretting it preseves it self from that mouldy Colour which others of the same Materials have contracted Tho' the  Italians  and VoyageWriters call these of  Rimini    Fano  and  Ancona  Triumphal Arches there was probably some Distinction made among the  Romans  between such Honorary Arches erected to Emperors and those that were rais'd to them on the Account of a Victory which are properly Triumphal Arches This at  Ancona  was an Instance of Gratitude to  Trajan  for the Port he had made there as the two others I have mention'd were probably for some Reason of the same Nature One may however observe the Wisdom of the ancient  Romans  who to encourage their Emperors in their Inclination of doing good to their Country gave the same Honours to the great Actions of Peace which turn'd to the  Advantage of the Publick as to those of War This is very remarkable in the Medals that were stamp'd on the same Occasions I remember to have seen one of  Galba  's with a Triumphal Arch on the Reverse that was made by the Senate's Order for his having remitted a Tax  R XXXX REMISSA S C  The Medal which was made for  Trajan  in Remembrance of his Benificence to  Ancona  is very common The Reverse has on it a Port with a Chain running across it and betwixt them both a Boat with this Inscription  S P Q R OPTIMO PRINCIPI S C  XXXX REMISSA S C  S P Q R OPTIMO PRINCEPI S C  I know  Fabretti  would fain ascribe this Medal to another Occasion but  Bellorio  in his Additions to  Angeloni  has sufficiently refuted all he says on that Subject  At  Loretto  I enquir'd for the  English  Jesuits Lodgings and on the StairCase that leads to 'em I saw several Pictures of such as had been Executed in  England  as the Two  Garnets    OldCorn  and others to the Number of Thirty Whatever were their Crimes the Inscription says they suffer'd for their Religion and some of 'em are represented lying under such Tortures as are not in use among us The Martyrs of are set by themselves with a Knife stuck in the Bosom of each Figure to signify that they were Quarter'd  The Riches in the Holy House and Treasury are surprizingly great and as much surpass'd my Expectation as other Sights have generally fallen short of it Silver can scarce find an Admission and Gold it self looks but poorly among such an incredible number of precious Stones There will be in a few Ages more the Jewels of the greatest Value in  Europe  if the Devotion of its Princes continues in its present Fervour The last Offering was made by the Queen Dowager of  Poland  and cost her Crowns Some have wonder'd that the  Turk  never attacks this Treasury since it lyes so near the Seashore and is so weakly guarded But besides that he has attempted it formerly with no Success it is certain the  Venetians  keep too watchful an Eye over his Motions at present and would never suffer him to enter the Adriatic It would indeed be an easie thing for a Christian Prince to surprize it who has Ships still passing to and fro without Suspicion especially if he had a Party in the Town disguis'd like Pilgrims to secure a Gate for him for there have been sometimes to the Number of in a Day's time as it is generally reported But 'tis probable the Veneration for the Holy House and  the Horror of an Action that would be resented by all the Catholick Princes of  Europe  will be as great a Security to the Place as the strongest Fortification It is indeed an amazing thing to see such a prodigious Quantity of Riches lye dead and untouch'd in the midst of so much Poverty and Misery as reign on all sides of 'em There is no question however but the Pope would make use of these Treasures in case of any great Calamity that should endanger the Holy See as an unfortunate War with the  Turk  or a powerful League among the Protestants For I can't but look on those vast Heaps of Wealth that are amass'd together in so many Religious Places of  Italy  as the hidden Reserves and Magazines of the Church that she would open on any pressing Occasion for her last Defence and Preservation If these Riches were all turn'd into current Coin and employ'd in Commerce they would make  Italy  the most flourishing Country in  Europe  The Case of the Holy House is nobly design'd and executed by the great Masters of  Italy  that flourish'd about a hundred Years ago The Statues of the  Sibyls  are very finely wrought each of 'em in a different Air and Posture as are likewise those of the Prophets  underneath 'em The Roof of the Treasury is painted with the same kind of Device There stands at the upper End of it a large Crucifix very much esteem'd the Figure of our Saviour represents him in his last Agonies of Death and amidst all the Ghastliness of the Visage has something in it very amiable The Gates of the Church are said to be of  Corinthian  Brass with many Scripture Stories rising on 'em in  Basso Relievo  The Pope's Statue and the Fountain by it would make a noble Show in a Place less beautified with so many other Productions of Art The Spicery the Cellar and its Furniture the great Revenues of the Convent with the Story of the Holy House are too well known to be here insisted upon  Whoever were the first Inventors of this Imposture they seem to have taken the hint of it from the Veneration that the old  Romans  paid to the Cottage of  Romulus  which stood on Mount  Capitol  and was repair'd from time to time as it fell to decay  Virgil  has given a pretty Image of this little thatch'd Palace that represents it standing in  Manlius  's Time Years after the Death of  Romulus  In summo custos Tarpeiae Manlius areis  Stabat pro templo capitolia celsa tenebat  Romuleoque recens horrebat Regia culmo  Aen L  High on a Rock Heroick  Manlius  stood  To guard the Temple and the Temple's God  Then  Rome  was poor and there you might behold  The Palace thatch'd with Straw  Dryden  From  Loretto  in my way to  Rome  I pass'd thro'  Recanati    Macorata    Tolentino  and  Foligni  In the last there is a Convent of Nuns call'd  la Contessa  that has in the Church an incomparable  Madonna  of  Raphel  At  Spoletto  the next Town on the Road are some Antiquities The most remarkable is an Aquaeduct of a  Gothic  Structure that conveys the Water from Mount St  Francis  to  Spoletto  which is not to be equall'd for its height by any other in  Europe  They reckon from the Foundation of the lowest Arch to the Top of it Yards In my way hence to  Terni  I saw the River  Clitumnus  celebrated by so many of the Poets for a particular Quality in its Waters of making Cattle white that  drink of it The Inhabitants of that Country have still the same Opinion of it as I found upon Enquiry and have a great many Oxen of a whitish Colour to confirm 'em in it It is probable this Breed was first settled in the Country and continuing still the same Species has made the Inhabitants impute it to a wrong Cause tho' they may as well fancy their Hogs turn black for some Reason of the same Nature because there are none in  Italy  of any other Breed The River  Clitumnus  and  Mevania  that stood on the Banks of it are famous for the Herds of Victims with which they furnish'd all  Italy  Qua formosa suo Clitumnus flumina luco  Integit Niveos abluit unda boves  Prop L  Hinc Albi Clitumne greges maxima Taurus

the next Town in Course formerly call'd  Interamna  for the same Reason that a part of  Asia  was nam'd  Mesopotamia  We enter at the Gate of the Three Monuments so call'd because there stood near in a Monument erected to  Tacitus  the Historian with two others to the Emperors  Tacitus  and  Florianus  all of them Natives of the Place These were a few Years ago Demolish'd by Thunder and the Fragments of them are in the Hands of some Gentlemen of the Town Near the Dome I was shown a square Marble inserted in the Wall with the following Inscription  Saluti perpetuae Augustae  Libertatique Publicae Populi Romani  Genio municipi Anno post Interamnam Conditam D CC IV  Ad Cnejum Domitium  Ahenobarbum  Coss providentiae Ti Caesaris  Augusti nati ad Aeternitatem Romani nominis sublato hoste perniciosissimo P R Faustus Titius Liberalis VI vir iterum P S F C  that is  pecunia sua fieri curavit  This Stone was probably set up on occasion of the Fall of  Sejanus  After the Name of  Ahenobarbus  there is a little Furrow in the Marble but so smooth and well polish'd that I should not have taken notice of it had not I seen  Coss  at the end of it by which it is plain there was once the Name of another Consul which has been industriously razed out  Lucias Aruncius Camillus Scribonianus  was Consul under the Reign of  Vid Fast Consul Sicul  Tiberius  and was afterwards put to Death for a Conspiracy that he had form'd against the Emperor  Claudius  at which time it was order'd that his Name and Consulate should be effaced out of all publick Registers and Inscriptions It is not therefore improbable that it was this long Name which fill'd up the Gap I am now mentioning There are near this Monument the Ruins of an ancient Theatre with some of the Caves entire I saw among the Ruins  an old Heathen Altar with this Particularity in it that it is hollow'd like a Dish at one End but it was not this End on which the Sacrifice was laid as one may guess from the Make of the Festoon that runs round the Altar and is inverted when the Hollow stands uppermost In the same Yard among the Rubbish of the Theatre lye Two Pillars the one of Granate and the other of a very beautiful Marble I went out of my way to see the Famous  Cascade  about Three Miles from  Terni  It it form'd by the Fall of the River  Velino  which  Virgil  mentions in the Seventh  AeneidRosed rura Velini  The Channel of this River lyes very high and is shaded on all sides by a Green Forest made up of several kinds of Trees that preserve their Verdure all the Year The neighbouring Mountains are cover'd with them and by reason of their height are more expos'd to the Dews and drizzling Rains than any of the adjacent Parts which gives occasion to  Virgil  's  Rosea rura  Dewy Countries The River runs extreamly rapid before its Fall and rushes down a Precipice of a Hundred Yards high It throws it self into the Hollow of a Rock which has probably been  worn by such a constant Fall of Water It is impossible to see the Bottom on which it breaks for the Thickness of the Mist that rises from it which looks at a Distance like Clouds of Smoak ascending from some vast Furnace and distils in perpetual Rains on all the Places that lye near it I think there is something more astonishing in this  Cascade  than in all the WaterWorks of  Versailles  and could not but wonder when I first saw it that I had never met with it in any of the old Poets especially in  Claudian  who makes his Emperor  Honorius  go out of his way to see the River  Nar  which runs just below it and yet does not mention what would have been so great an Embellishment to his Poem But at present I don't in the least question notwithstanding the Opinion of some Learned Men to the contrary that this is the Gulf thro' which  Virgil  's  Alecto  shoots her self into Hell for the very Place the great Reputation of it the Fall of Waters the Woods that encompass it with the Smoak and Noise that arise from it are all pointed at in the Description Perhaps he would not mention the Name of the River because he has done it in the Verses that precede We may add  to this that the  Cascade  is not far off that part of  Italy  which has been call'd  Italiae Meditullium  Est locus Italiae medio sub montibus altis  Nobilis famâ multis memoratus in oris  Amsancti valles densis hunc frondibus atrum  Urget utrinque latus nemoris medioque fragosus  Dat sonitum saxis torto vortice torrens  Hic specus horrendum saevi spiracula Ditis  Monstrantur ruptoque ingens Acheronte vorago  Pestiferas aperit fauces queis condita Erinnys  Invisum Numen terras coelumque levabat  Aen  In midst of  Italy  well known to Fame  There lies a Vale  Amsanctus  is the Name  Below the lofty Mounts On either side  Thick Forests the forbidden Entrance hide  Full in the Centre of the Sacred Wood  An Arm ariseth of the  Stygian  Flood  Which falling from on high with bellowing Sound  Whirls the black Waves and ratling Stones around  Here  Pluto  pants for Breath from out his Cell  And opens wide the grinning Jaws of Hell  To this Infernal Gate the Fury flies  Here hides her hated Head and frees the lab'ring Skies  Dryden  It was indeed the most proper Place in the World for a Fury to make her  Exit  after she had fill'd a Nation with Distractions and Alarms and I believe every Reader's Imagination is pleas'd when he sees the angry Goddess thus sinking as it were in a Tempest and plunging herself into Hell amidst such a Scene of Horror and Confusion  The River  Velino  after having found its way out from among the Rocks where it falls runs into the  Nera  The Channel of this last River is white with Rocks and the Surface of it for a long Space cover'd with Froth and Bubbles for it runs all along upon the Fret and is still breaking against the Stones that oppose its Passage So that for these Reasons as well as for the Mixture of Sulphur in its Waters it is very well describ'd by  Virgil  in that Verse which mentions these Two Rivers in their old  Roman  Names  Tartaream intendit vocem quà protinus omne  Contremuit nemus sylvae into  ere profundae  Audiit longè Triviae lacus audiit amnis  Sulphureâ Nar albus aquâ fontesque Velini  Aen  The Sacred Lake of  Trivia  from afar  The  Veline  Fountains and Sulphureous  Nar    Shake at the Baleful Blast the Signal of the War  Dryden  He makes the Sound of the Fury's Trumpet run up the  Nera  to the very Sources of  Velino  which agrees extreamly well with the Situation of these Rivers When  Virgil  has mark'd any particular Quality in a River the other Poets seldom fail of Copying after him  Sulphureus Nar  Auson  Narque albescentibus undis  In Tibrim properans  Sil It L  Et Nar vitiatus odoro  Sulfure  Claud de Pr Olyb Cons  The Hoary  Nar  Corrupted with the Stench of Sulphur flows  And into  Tiber  's Streams th' infected Current throws  From this River our next Town on the Road receives the Name of  Narni  I saw hereabouts nothing remarkable except  Augustus  's Bridge that stands half a Mile from the Town and is one of the stateliest Ruins in  Italy  It has no Cement and looks as firm as one entire Stone There is an Arch of it unbroken the broadest that I have ever seen tho' by reason of its great height it does not appear so The middle one was still much broader They join together Two Mountains and belong'd without doubt to the Bridge that  Martial  mentions tho' Mr  Ray  takes 'em to be the Remains of an ancient Aquaeduct  Sed jam parce mihi nec abutere Narnia Quinto  Perpetuo liceat sic tibi ponte frui  L  Preserve my better Part and spare my Friend  So  Narni  may thy Bridge for ever stand  From  Narni  I went to  Otricoli  a very mean little Village that stands where the Castle of  Ocriculum  did formerly I turn'd about half a Mile out of the Road to see the Ruins of the old  Ocriculum    that lye near the Banks of the  Tiber  There are still scatter'd Pillars and Pedestals huge Pieces of Marble half bury'd in the Earth Fragments of Towers Subterraneous Vaults Bathing Places and the like Marks of its ancient Magnificence  In my way to  Rome  seeing a high Hill standing by it self in the  Campania  I did not question but it had a  Classic  Name and upon Enquiry found it to be Mount  Soracte  The  Italians  at present call it because its Name begins with an  S  St  Oreste  The Fatigue of our crossing the  Appenines  and of our whole Journey from  Loretto  to  Rome  was very agreeably reliev'd by the Variety of Scenes we pass'd thro' For not to mention the rude Prospect of Rocks rising one above another of the deep Gutters worn in the Sides of 'em by Torrents of Rain and SnowWater or the long Channels of Sand winding about their Bottoms that are sometimes filled with so many Rivers We saw in Six Days Travelling the several Seasons of the Year in their Beauty and Perfection We were sometimes Shivering on the Top of a bleak Mountain and a little while after Basking in a warm Valley covered  with Violets and Almondtrees in Blossom the Bees already swarming over 'em tho' but in the Month of  February  Sometimes our Road led us thro' Groves of Olives or by Gardens of Oranges or into several hollow Apartments among the Rocks and Mountains that look like so many natural GreenHouses as being always shaded with a great Variety of Trees and Shrubs that never lose their Verdure  I shall say nothing of the  Via Flaminia  which has been spoken of by most of the VoyageWriters that have pass'd it but shall set down  Claudian  's Account of the Journey that  Honorius  made from  Ravenna  to  Rome  which lyes most of it in the fame Road that I have been describing  Antiquae muros egressa Ravennae  Signa movet jamque or a Padi portusque relinquit  Flumineos certis ubi legibus

very scarce at  Ravenna  and was probably much more so when the Sea was within its Neighbourhood  FROM ROME TO NAPLES  _UPON my Arrival at  Rome  I took a View of St  Peters  and the  Rotunda  leaving the rest 'till my Return from  Naples  when I should have time and leisure enough to consider what I saw St  Peters  seldom answers Expectation at first entering it but enlarges it self on all Sides insensibly and mends upon the Eye every Moment The Proportions are so very well observ'd that nothing appears to an Advantage or distinguishes it self above the rest It seems neither extreamly high nor long nor broad because it is all of them in a just Equality As on the contrary in our  Gothic  Cathedrals the Narrowness  of the Arch makes it rise in Height or run out in Length the Lowness often opens it in Breadth or the Defectiveness of some other Particular makes any single Part appear in greater Perfection Tho' every thing in this Church is admirable the most astonishing Part of it is the Cupola Upon my going to the Top of it I was surpriz'd to find that the Dome which we see in the Church is not the same that one looks upon without Doors the last of 'em being a kind of Case to the other and the Stairs lying betwixt 'em both by which one ascends into the Ball Had there been only the outward Dome it would not have shewn it self to an Advantage to those that are in the Church or had there only been the inward one it would scarce have been seen by those that are without had they both been one solid Dome of so great a Thickness the Pillars would have been too weak to have supported it after having survey'd this Dome I went to see the  Rotunda  which is generally said to have been the Model of it This Church is at present so much chang'd from the ancient  Pantheon  as  Pliny  has describ'd it that some have been inclin'd to think it is not the same Temple but the Cavalier  Fontana  has abundantly satisfy'd the World in this Particular and shewn how the ancient Figure and Ornaments of the  Pantheon  have been chang'd into what they are at present This Author who is now esteem'd the best of the  Roman  Architects has lately written a Treatise on  Vespasian  's Amphitheater which is not yet Printed  After having seen these Two Masterpieces of Modern and Ancient Architecture I have often consider'd with my self whether the ordinary Figure of the Heathen or that of the Christian Temples be the most beautiful and the most capable of Magnificence and can't forbear thinking the Cross Figure more proper for such spacious Buildings than the  Rotund  I must confess the Eye is better fill'd at first entering the  Rotund  and takes in the whole Beauty and Magnificence of the Temple at one view But such as are built in the Form of a Cross give us a greater Variety of Noble Prospects Nor is it easie to conceive a more glorious Show in Architecture than what a Man meets with in St  Peters  when he stands under the Dome If he looks upward he is astonish'd at the spacious Hollow of the Cupola and has a Vault on every side of him that  makes one of the beautifullest  Vistas  that the Eye can possibly pass thro' I know that such as are profess'd Admirers of the Ancients will find abundance of Chimerical Beauties the Architects themselves never thought of as one of the most Famous of the Moderns in that Art tells us the Hole in the Roof of the  Rotunda  is so admirably contriv'd that it makes those who are in the Temple look like Angels by diffusing the Light equally on all sides of 'em  In all the old Highways that lead from  Rome  one sees several little Ruins on each side of 'em that were formerly so many Sepulchres for the ancient  Romans  generally bury'd their Dead near the great Roads  Quorum Flaminiâ tegitur cinis atque Latinâ  Juv S  None but some few of a very extraordinary Quality having been interred within the Walls of the City  Our Christian Epitaphs that are to be seen only in Churches or ChurchYards begin often with a  Siste ViatorViator precare salutem  c probably in Imitation of the old  Roman  Inscriptions that generally address'd themselves to the  Travellers as it was impossible for 'em to enter the City or to go out of it without passing thro' one of these melancholly Roads which for a great Length was nothing else but a Street of Funeral Monuments  In my way from  Rome  to  Naples  I found nothing so remarkable as the Beauty of the Country and the extream Poverty of its Inhabitants It is indeed an amazing thing to see the present Desolation of  Italy  when one considers what incredible Multitudes of People it abounded with during the Reigns of the  Roman  Emperors And notwithstanding the Removal of the Imperial Seat the Irruptions of the Barbarous Nations the Civil Wars of this Country with the Hardships of its several Governments one can scarce imagine how so plentiful a Soil should become so miserably unpeopled in Comparison of what it once was We may reckon by a very moderate Computation more Inhabitants in the  Campania  of Old  Rome  than are now in all  Italy  And if we could number up those prodigious Swarms that had settled themselves in every Part of this delighful Country I question not but that they would amount to more than can be found at present in any Six  Parts of  Europe  of the same Extent This Desolation appears no where greater than in the Pope's Territories and yet there are several Reasons would make a Man expect to see these Dominions the best regulated and most flourishing of any other in  Europe  Their Prince is generally a Man of Learning and Virtue mature in Years and Experience who has seldom any Vanity or Pleasure to gratify at his People's Expence and is neither encumber'd with Wife Children or Mistresses not to mention the suppos'd Sanctity of his Character which obliges him in a more particular manner to consult the Good and Happiness of Mankind The Direction of Church and State are lodg'd entirely in his own Hands so that his Government is naturally free from those Principles of Faction and Division which are mix'd in the very Composition of most others His Subjects are always ready to fall in with his Designs and are more at his Disposal than any others of the most absolute Government as they have a greater Veneration for his Person and not only court his Favour but his Blessing His Country is extreamly fruitful and has good Havens both for the Adriatic and  Mediterranean which is an Advantage peculiar to himself and the  Neapolitans  above the rest of the  Italians  There is still a Benefit the Pope enjoys above all other Soveraigns in drawing great Sums out of  Spain    Germany  and other Countries that belong to Foreign Princes which one would fancy might be no small Ease to his own Subjects We may here add that there is no Place in  Europe  so much frequented by Strangers whether they are such as come out of Curiosity or such who are obliged to attend the Court of  Rome  on several Occasions as are many of the Cardinals and Prelates that bring considerable Sums into the Pope's Dominions But notwithstanding all these promising Circumstances and the long Peace that has reign'd so many years in  Italy  there is not a more miserable People in  Europe  than the Pope's Subjects His State is thin of Inhabitants and a great Part of his Soil uncultivated His Subjects are wretchedly poor and idle and have neither sufficient Manufactures nor Traffick to employ 'em These ill Effects may arise in a great measure out of the Arbitrariness of the Government but I think they are chiefly to be ascrib'd to the very Genius of the  Roman  Catholick  Religion which here shews it self in its Perfection It is not strange to find a Country half unpeopled where so great a proportion of the Inhabitants of both Sexes is ty'd under such Vows of Chastity and where at the same time an Inquisition forbids all Recruits out of any other Religion Nor is it less easy to account for the great Poverty and Want that are to be met with in a Country which invites into it such Swarms of Vagabonds under the Title of Pilgrims and shuts up in Cloisters such an incredible Multitude of young and lusty Beggars who instead of encreasing the Common Stock by their Labour and Industry lye as a dead Weight on their Fellow Subjects and consume the Charity that ought to support the Sickly Old and Decrepid The many Hospitals that are every where erected serve rather to encourage Idleness in the People than to set 'em at Work not to mention the great Riches which lye useless in Churches and Religious Houses with the Multitude of Festivals that must never be violated by Trade or Business To speak truly they are here so wholly taken up with Mens Souls that they neglect the good of their Bodies and when to these natural Evils  in the Government and Religion there arises among 'em an Avaritious Pope who is for making a Family it is no wonder if the People sink under such a Complication of Distempers Yet it is to this Humour of Nepotism that  Rome  owes its present Splendor and Magnificence for it would have been impossible to have furnish'd out so many glorious Palaces with such a Profusion of Pictures Statues and the like Ornaments had not the Riches of the People at several times fallen into the Hands of many different Families and of particular Persons as we may observe tho' the Bulk of the  Roman  People was more rich and happy in the times of the Commonwealth the City of  Rome  receiv'd all its Beauties and Embellishments under the Emperors It is probable the  Campania  of  Rome  as well as other Parts of the Pope's Territories would be cultivated much better than it is were there not such an Exorbitant Tax on Corn which makes 'em plow up only such Spots of Ground as turn to the most Advantage Whereas were the Money to be rais'd on Lands with an Exception to some of the more barren Parts that might be Taxfree for a certain Term of Years every one would turn his Ground to the  best Account and in a little time perhaps bring more Money into the Pope's Treasury  The greatest Pleasure I took in my Journey from  Rome  to  Naples  was in seeing the Fields Towns and Rivers that have been describ'd by so many  Classic  Authors and have been the Scenes of so many great Actions for this whole Road is extreamly barren of Curiosities It is worth while to have an Eye on  Horace  's Voyage to  Brundisi  when one passes this way for by comparing his several Stages and the Road he took with those that are observ'd at present we may have some Idea of the Changes that have been made in the Face of this Country since his Time If we may guess at the common Trevelling of Persons of Quality among the ancient  Romans  from this Poet's Description of his Voyage we may conclude they seldom went above Fourteen Miles a Day over the  Appian  Way which was more us'd by the Noble  Romans  than any other in  Italy  as it led to  Naples    Baïae  and the most delightful Parts of the Nation It is indeed very disagreeable to be carry'd in haste over this Pavement  Minùs est gravis Appia tardis  Hor  Lucan  has describ'd the very Road from  Anxur  to  Rome  that  Horace  took from  Rome  to  Anxur  It is not indeed the ordinary Way at present nor is it mark'd out by the same Places in both Poets  Jamque praecipites superaverat Anxuris arces  Et qua  A Canal the Marks of it still seen  Pontinas via dividit uda paludes  Quà sublime nemus Scythicae quà regna Dianae  Quàque iter est Latiis ad summam fascibus Albam  Excelsâ de rupe procul jam conspicit

he next invades  And crossing through the consecrated Shades  Ascends high  Alba  whence with new Delight  He sees the City rising to his Sight  In my way to  Naples  I cross'd the Two most considerable Rivers of the  Campania Felice  that were formerly call'd the  Liris  and  Vulturnus  and are at present the  Garigliano  and  Vulturno  The First of these Rivers has been deservedly celebrated by the  Latin  Poets for the Gentleness of its Course as the other for its Rapidity and Noise  Rura quae Liris quietâ  Mordet aquâ taciturnus Amnis  H Li Od  Lirisqui fonte quieto

now see  Terracina  and by reason of the Breezes that came off the Sea and the Height of its Situation was one of the Summer Retirements of the ancient  Romans  O nemus O fontes solidumque madentis

while to take notice that the Figures  which are cut in the Rock near  Terracina  encrease still in a Decimal Proportion as they come nearer the Bottom If one of our VoyageWriters who passed this way more than once had observed the Situation of these Figures he would not have troubled himself with the Dissertation that he has made upon them  Silius Italicus  has given us the Names of several Towns and Rivers in the  Campania Felice  Jam verò quos dives opum quos dives avorum  Et toto dabat ad bellum Campania tractu  Ductorum adventum vicinis Sedibus Osci  Servabant Sinuessa tepens fluctuque

First Days at  Naples  were taken up with the Sight of Processions which are always very magnificent in the HolyWeek It would be tedious to give an Account of the several Representations of our Saviour's Death and Resurrection of the Figures of himself the Blessed Virgin and the Apostles which are carry'd up and down on this Occasion with the Cruel Penances that several inflict on themselves and the Multitude of Ceremonies that attend these Solemnities I saw at the same time a very splendid Procession for the Accession of the Duke of  Anjou  to the Crown of  Spain  in which the ViceRoy bore his Part at the Left Hand of Cardinal  Cantelmi  To grace the Parade they expos'd at the same time the Blood of St  Januarius  which liquefy'd at the approach of the Saint's Head tho' as they say it was hard congeal'd before I had twice an Opportunity of seeing the Operation of this pretended  Miracle and must confess I think it so far from being a real Miracle that I look upon it as one of the most Bungling Tricks that I ever saw Yet it is this that makes as great a Noise as any in the  Roman  Church and that Monsieur  Paschal  has hinted at among the rest in his Marks of the true Religion The modern  Neapolitans  seem to have copy'd it out from one which was shown in a Town of the Kingdom of  Naples  as long ago as in  Horace  's Time  Dehinc Gnatia lymphis  Iratis extructa dedit risusque jocosque  Dum flamma sine thura liquescere limine Sacro  Persuadere cupit credat Judaeus apella  Non ego  Sat L  At  Gnatia  next arriv'd we laugh'd to see  The superstitious Croud's Simplicity  That in the sacred Temple needs would try  Without a Fire th' unheated Gums to fry  Believe who will the Solemn Sham not I  One may see at least that the Heathen Priesthood had the same kind of Secret among them of which the  Roman  Catholicks are now Masters  I must confess tho' I had liv'd above a Year in a  Roman  Catholick Country I was surpriz'd to see many Ceremonies and Superstitions in  Naples  that are not so much as thought of in  France  But as it is certain there has been a kind of Secret Reformation made tho' not publickly own'd in the  Roman  Catholick Church since the spreading of the Protestant Religion so we find the several Nations are recover'd out of their Ignorance in proportion as they converse more or less with those of the Reform'd Churches For this Reason the  French  are much more enlighten'd than the  Spaniards  or  Italians  on occasion of their frequent Controversies with the  Huguenots  and we find many of the  Roman  Catholick Gentlemen of our own Country who will not stick to laugh at the Superstitions they sometimes meet with in other Nations  I shall not be particular in describing the Grandeur of the City of  Naples  the Beauty of its Pavement the Regularity of its Buildings the Magnificence of its Churches and Convents the Multitude  of its Inhabitants or the Delightfulness of its Situation which so many others have done with a great deal of Leisure and Exactness If a War should break out the Town has reason to apprehend the exacting of a large Contribution or a Bombardment It has but Seven Gallies a Mole and Two little Castles which are capable of hindering an Enemy's Approaches Besides that the Sea which lyes near it is not subject to Storms has no sensible Flux and Reflux and is so deep that a Vessel of Burden may come up to the very Mole The Houses are flat Roof'd to walk upon so that every Bomb that fell on them would take Effect  Pictures Statues and Pieces of Antiquity are not so common at  Naples  as one might expect in so great and ancient a City of  Italy  for the ViceRoys take care to send into  Spain  every thing that is valuable of this Nature Two of their finest modern Statues are those of  Apollo  and  Minerva  plac'd on each side of  Sannazarius  's Tomb On the Face of this Monument which is all of Marble and very neatly wrought is represented in  Bas relief    Neptune  among the Satyrs to show that this Poet was the Inventer of Piscatory Eclogues I  remember  Hugo Grotius  describes himself in one of his Poems as the first that brought the Muses to the Seaside but he must be understood only of the Poets of his own Country I here saw the Temple that  Sannazarius  mentions in his Invocation of the Blessed Virgin at the beginning of his  De partu Virginis  which was all rais'd at his own Expence  Niveis tibi si solennia templis  Serta damus si mansuras tibi ponimus aras  Exciso in scopulo fluctus unde aurea canos  Despiciens celso de culmine Mergilline  Attollit nautisque procul venientibus offert  Tu vatem ignarumque viae insuetumque labori  Diva mone  L  Thou bright Celestial Goddess if to Thee  An acceptable Temple I erect  With fairest Flow'rs and freshest Garlands deck'd  On tow'ring Rocks whence  Mergillinè  spies  The ruffled Deep in Storms and Tempests rise  Guide thou the Pious Poet nor refuse  Thine own propitious Aid to his unpractis'd Muse  There are several very delightful Prospects about  Naples  especially from some of the Religious Houses for one seldom finds in  Italy  a Spot of Ground more agreeable than ordinary that is not cover'd with a Convent The Cupola's of this City tho' there are many of them don't appear to the best Advantage when one surveys them at a distance as being generally too high and narrow The Marquis of  Medina Cidonia  in his ViceRoyalty made the Shell of a House which he had not time to finish that commands a View of the whole Bay and would have been a very noble Building had he brought it to Perfection  It stands so on the side of a Mountain that it would have had a Garden to every Story by the help of a Bridge which was to have been laid over each Garden  The Bay of  Naples  is the most delightful one that I ever saw It lyes in almost a round Figure of about Thirty Miles in the Diameter Three Parts of it are shelter'd with a noble Circuit of Woods and Mountains The high Promontory of  Surrentum  divides it from the Bay of  Salernum  Between the utmost Point of this Promontory and the  Isle of  Caprea  the Sea enters by a Streight of about Three Miles wide This Island stands as a vast Mole which seems to have been planted there on purpose to break the Violence of the Waves that run into the Bay It lyes longways almost in a parallel Line to  Naples  The excessive Height of its Rocks secures a great part of the Bay from Winds and Waves which enter again between the other End of this Island and the Promontory of  Miseno  The Bay of  Naples  is call'd the  Crater  by the old Geographers probably from this its Resemblance to a round Bowl half fill'd with Liquor Perhaps  Virgil  who compos'd here a great part of his  Aeneids  took from hence the Plan of that beautiful Harbour which he has made in his First Book for the  Libyan  Port is but the  Neapolitan  Bay in little  Est in secessu longo locus Insula Portum  Efficit objectu laterum quibus omnis ab alto  Frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos  Hinc atque hinc vastae rupes geminique minantur  In coelum scopuli quorum sub vertice latè  Aequora tuta silent tum Silvis Scena coruscis  Desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbrâ  Aen  Within a long Recess there lyes a Bay  An Island shades it from the rouling Sea  And forms a Port secure for Ships to ride  Broke by the jutting Land on either side  In double Streams the briny Waters glide  Between Two Rows of Rocks a  Sylvan  Scene  Appears above and Groves for ever Green  Dryden  Naples  stands in the Bosom of this Bay and has the pleasantest Situation in the World tho' by reason of its Western Mountains it wants an Advantage  Vitruvius  would have to the Front of his Palace of seeing the Setting Sun  One would wonder how the  Spaniards  who have but very few Forces in the Kingdom of  Naples  should be able to keep a People from Revolting that has been famous for its Mutinies and Seditions in former Ages But they  have so well contriv'd it that tho' the Subjects are miserably harass'd and oppress'd the greatest of their Oppressors are those of their own Body I shall not mention any thing of the Clergy who are sufficiently reproached in most Itineraries for the universal Poverty that one meets with in this noble and plentiful Kingdom A great Part of the People is in a State of Vassallage to the Barons who are the harshest Tyrants in the World to those that are under them The Vassals indeed are allow'd and invited to bring in their Complaints and Appeals to the ViceRoy who to foment Divisions and gain the Hearts of the Populace does not stick at Imprisoning and Chastising their Masters very severely on occasion The Subjects of the Crown are notwithstanding much more rich and happy than the Vassals of the Barons Insomuch that when the King has been upon the point of selling a Town to one of his Barons the Inhabitants have rais'd the Sum upon themselves and presented it to the King that they might keep out of so insupportable a Slavery Another way the  Spaniards  have taken to grind the  Neapolitans  and yet to take off the  Odium  from themselves has been by erecting  several Courts of Justice with a very small Pension for such as fit at the Head of them so that they are tempted to take Bribes keep Causes undecided encourage Lawsuits and do all they can to fleece the People that they may have wherewithal to support their own Dignity It is incredible how great a Multitude of Retainers to the Law there are at  Naples  It is commonly said that when  Innocent  the Eleventh had desir'd the Marquis of  Carpio  to furnish him with Thirty Thousand Head of Swine the Marquis answer'd him that for his Swine he could not spare them but if his Holiness had occasion for Thirty Thousand Lawyers he had them at his Service These Gentlemen find a continual Employ for the fiery Temper of the  Neapolitans  and hinder them from uniting in such common Friendships and Alliances as might endanger the Safety of the Government There are very few Persons of Consideration who have not a Cause depending for when a  Neapolitan  Cavalier has nothing else to do he gravely shuts himself up in his Closet and falls a tumbling over his Papers to see if he can start a Law Suit and plague any of his Neighbours So much is the Genius of this People chang'd since  Statius  's Time  Nulla foro rabies aut strictae Jurgia Legis  Morum jura viris solum et sine fascibus Aequum  Sil L  By Love of Right and Native Justice led  In the straight Paths of Equity they tread  Nor know the Bar nor fear the Judge's Frown  Unpractis'd in the Wranglings of the Gown  There is another Circumstance which makes the  Neapolitans  in a very particular manner the Oppressors of each other The Gables of  Naples  are very high on Oil Wine Tobacco and indeed on almost every thing that can be eaten drank or worn There would have been one on Fruit had not  Massianello  's Rebellion abolish'd it as it has probably put a stop to many others What makes these Imposts more intolerable to the poorer sort they are laid on all Butchers Meat while at the same time the Fowl and Gibier are Tax free Besides all Meat being Taxed equally by the Pound it happens that the Duty lyes heaviest  on the coarser sorts which are most likely to fall to the share of the common People so that Beef perhaps pays a Third and Veal a Tenth of its Price to the Government a Pound of either sort having the same Tax fix'd on it These Gabels are most of them at present in the Hands of private Men for as the King of  Spain  has had occasion for Mony he has borrow'd it of the Rich  Neapolitans  on Condition that they should receive the Interest out of such or such Gabels 'till he could repay them the Principal  This he has repeated so often that at present there is scarce a single Gabel unmortgag'd so that there is no Place in  Europe  which pays greater Taxes and at the same time no Prince who draws less Advantage from them In other Countries the People have the Satisfaction of seeing the Mony they give spent in the Necessities Defence or Ornament of their State or at least in the Vanity or Pleasures of their Prince but here most of it goes to the enriching of their FellowSubjects If there was not so great a Plenty of every thing in  Naples  the People could not bear it The  Spaniard  however reaps this Advantage from the present posture of Affairs that  the Murmurs of the Peeple are turn'd upon their own Countrymen and what is more considerable that almost all the Persons of the greatest Wealth and Power in  Naples  are engag'd by their own Interests to pay these Impositions chearfully and to support the Government which has laid them on For this Reason tho' the poorer sort are for the Emperor few of the Persons of Consequence can endure to think of a Change in their present Establishment tho' there is no question but the King of  Spain  will Reform most of these Abuses by breaking or retrenching the Power of the Barons by cancelling several unnecessary Employs or by ransoming or taking the Gabels into his own Hands I have been told too there is a Law of  Charles  the Fifth something like our Statute of Mortmain which has laid dormant ever since his Time and will probably have new Life put into it under the Reign of an active Prince The Inhabitants of  Naples  have been always very notorious for leading a Life of Laziness and Pleasure which I take to arise partly out of the wonderful Plenty of their Country that does not make Labour so necessary to them and partly out of the Temper of their Climate that relaxes  the Fibres of their Bodies and disposes the People to such an idle indolent Humour Whatever it proceeds from we find they were formerly as famous for it as they are at present  This was perhaps the Reason that the Ancients tell us one of the  Sirens  was bury'd in this City which thence receiv'd the Name of  Parthenope  Improba Siren  Desida  Hor Sa L  Sloth

Distance from  Naples  lyes a very noble Scene of Antiquities What they call  Virgil  's Tomb is the first that one meets with on the Way thither It is certain this Poet was bury'd at  Naples  but I think it is almost as certain that his Tomb stood on the other side of the Town which looks towards  Vesuvio  By this Tomb is the Entry into the Grotto of  Pausilypo  The common People of  Naples  believe it to have been wrought by Magick and  that  Virgil  was the Magician who is in greater Repute among the  Neapolitans  for having made the Grotto than the  Aeneid  If a Man would form to himself a just Idea of this Place he must fancy a vast Rock undermin'd from one End to the other and a Highway running thro' it near as long and as broad as the Mall in St  James  's Park This Subterraneous Passage is much mended since  Seneca  gave so bad a Character of it The Entry at both Ends is higher than the middle Parts of it and sinks by degrees to fling in more Light upon the rest Towards the middle are Two large Funnels bor'd thro' the Roof of the Grotto to let in Light and fresh Air  There are no where about the Mountain any vast Heaps of Stones tho' it is certain the great Quantities of 'em that are dug out of the Rock could not easily conceal themselves had they not probably been consum'd in the Moles and Buildings of  Naples  This confirm'd me in a Conjecture which I made at the first sight of this Subterraneous Passage that it was not at first design'd so much for a Highway as for a Quarry of Stone but that the Inhabitants finding a double Advantage by it hew'd it into the Form we  now see Perhaps the same Design gave the Original to the  SibyL  's Grotto considering the prodigious Multitude of Palaces that stood in its Neighbourhood  I remember when I was at  Chateaudun  in  France  I met with a very curious Person a Member of one of the  German  Universities He had stay'd a Day or Two in the Town longer than ordinary to take the Measures of several empty Spaces that had been cut in the Sides of a neighbouring Mountain Some of 'em were supported with Pillars form'd out of the Rock some were made in the Fashion of Galleries and some not unlike Amphitheaters The Gentleman had made to himself several ingenious Hypotheses concerning the use of these Subterraneous Apartments and from thenee collected the vast magnificence and Luxury of the ancient  Chateaudunois  But upon communicating his Thoughts on this Subject to one of the most Learned of the Place he was not a little surpriz'd to hear that these stupendous Works of Art were only so many Quarries of FreeStone that had been wrought into different Figures according as the Veins of it directed the Workmen  About Five Miles from the Grotto of  Pausilypo  lye the Remains of  Puteoli  and  Bajae  in a soft Air and a delicious Situation  The Country about 'em by reason of its vast Caverns and Subterraneous Fires has been miserably torn in Pieces by Earthquakes so that the whole Face of it is quite chang'd from what it was formerly The Sea has overwhelm'd a Multitude of Palaces which may be seen at the Bottom of the Water in a calm Day  The  Lucrine  Lake is but a Puddle in Comparison of what it once was its Springs having been sunk in an Earthquake or stopp'd up by Mountains that have fallen upon 'em The Lake of  Avernus  formerly so famous for its Steams of Poison is now plentifully stock'd with Fish and Fowl Mount  Gaurus  from one of the fruitfullest Parts in  Italy  is become one of the most barren Several Fields which were laid out in beautiful Groves and Gardens are now naked Plains smoaking with Sulphur or encumber'd with Hills that have been thrown up by Eruptions of Fire The Works of Art lye in no less Disorder than those of Nature for that which was once the most Beautiful Spot of  Ialy    cover'd with Temples and Palaces adorn'd by the greatest of the  Roman  Commonwealth embelish'd by many of the  Roman  Emperors and celebrated by the best of their Poets has now nothing to show but the Ruins of its ancient Splendor and a great Magnificence in Confusion  The Mole of  Puteoli  has been mistaken by several Authors for  Caligula  's Bridge They have all been led into this Error from the Make of it because it stands on Arches But to pass over the many Arguments that may be brought against this Opinion I shall here take away the Foundation of it by setting down an Inscription mention'd by  Julius Capitolinus  in the Life of  Antoninus Pius  who was the Repairer of this Mole  Imp Caesari Divi Hadriano filio Divi Trajani Parthici Nepoti Divi Nervae pronepoti T Act Hadriano Antonino Aug Pio  c  quod super caetera beneficia ad hujus etiam tutelam portûs  Pilarum  viginti  molem  cum sumptu  fornicum  reliquo ex Aeratio suo largitus est  It would have been very difficult to have made such a Mole as this of  Puteli  in a Place where they had not so natural a Commodity as the Earth of  Puzzuola  which immediately hardens in the  Water and after a little lying in it looks rather like Stone than Mortar It was this that gave the ancient  Romans  an Opportunity of making so many Encroachments on the Sea and of laying the Foundations of their Villas and Palaces within the very Borders of it as  L O L O L O Epist L  Horace  has elegantly described it more than once  About Four Years ago they dug up a great Piece of Marble near  Puzzuola  with several Figures and Letters Engraven round it which have given occasion to some Disputes among the Antiquaries  Vid Gronovium Fa bretti Bulifon  c    But they all agree that it is the Pedestal of a Statue erected to  Tiberius  by the Fourteen Cities of  Asia  which were flung down by an Earthquake the same that according to the Opinion of many Learned Men happen'd at our Saviour's Crucifixion They have found in the Letters which are still legible the Names of the several Cities and discover in each Figure something particular to the City of which it represents the Genius There are two Medals of  Tiberius  stamp'd on the same Occasion  with this Inscription to one of 'em  Civitatibus Asiae Restitutis  The Emperor is represented in both sitting with a  Patera  in one Hand and a Spear in the other  CIVITATIBVS ASIAE RESTITVTIS  CAESAR DIVI AVG F AVGVSTVS  ON MAX TR POT XXXIII TI  It is probable this might have been the Posture of the Statue which in all likelihood does not lye far from the Place where they took up the Pedestal for they say there were other great Pieces of Marble near it and several of 'em Inscrib'd but that no Body would be at the Charges of bringing them to light The Pedestal it self lay neglected in an open Field when I saw it I shall not be particular on the Ruins of the Amphitheater the ancient Reservoirs of Water the  Sibyl  's Grotto the  Centum Camerae  the Sepulchre of  Agrippina Nero  's Mother with several other Antiquities of less Note that lye in the Neighbourhood of this Bay and have been often describ'd by many others I must confess after having survey'd the Antiquities about  Naples  and  Rome  I cannot but think that our Admiration of 'em does not so much arise out of their Greatness as Uncommonness  There are indeed many extraordinary Ruins but I believe a traveller would not be so much astonish'd at 'em did he find any Works of the same kind in his own Country Amphitheatres Triumphal Arches Baths Grotto's Catacombs Rotunda's Highways pav'd for so great a Length Bridges of such an  amazing Height Subterraneous Buildings for the Reception of Rain and SnowWater are most of 'em at present out of Fashion and only to be met with among the Antiquities of  Italy  We are therefore immediately surpriz'd when we see any considerable Sums laid out in any thing of this Nature tho' at the same time there is many a  Gothic  Cathedral in  England  that has cost more Pains and Mony than several of these celebrated Works Among the Ruins of the old Heathen Temples they show'd me what they call the Chamber of  Venus  which stands a little behind her Temple It is wholly dark and has several Figures on the Cieling wrought in  Stucco  that seem to represent Lust and Strength by the Emblems of naked  Jupiters  and  Gladiators    Tritons  and  Centaurs  c so that one would guess it has formerly been the Scene of many lewd Mysteries On the other side of  Naples  are the Catacombs These must have been full of Stench and Loathsomness if the dead Bodies that lay in 'em were left to rot in open Nitches as an Eminent Author of our own Country Imagine's But upon examining 'em I find they were each of 'em stop'd up  without doubt as soon as the Corps was laid in it For at the Mouth of the Nitch one always finds the Rock cut into little Channels to fasten the Board or Marble that was to close it up and I think I did not see one which had not still some Mortar sticking in it In some I found pieces of Tiles that exactly tally'd with the Channel and in others a little Wall of Bricks that sometimes stopp'd up above a quarter of the Nitch the rest having been broken down  Proculus  's Sepulchre seems to have a kind of Mosaic Work on its Covering for I observ'd at one End of it several little Pieces of Marble rang'd together after that manner 'Tis probable they were adorn'd more or less according to the Quality of the Dead One would indeed wonder to find such a Multitude of Nitches unstopp'd and I can't imagine any Body should take the Pains to do it who was not in Quest of some suppos'd Treasure  Bajae  was the Winter Retreat of the old  Romans  that being the proper Season to enjoy the  Bajani Soles  and the  Mollis Lucrinus  as on the contrary  Tibur    Tusculum    Prenaeste    Alba    Cajeta    Mons Circeius    Anxur  and the like airy Mountains and Promontories were  their Retirements during the Heats of Summer  Dum nos blanda tenent jucundi Stagna Lucrini  Et quae pumiceis fontibus antra calent  Tu colis Argivi regnum Faustine coloni  Vid Hor L

of Sulphur raise a stifling Heat  And through the Pores of the warm Pumice sweat  You taste the cooling Breeze where nearer home  The Twentieth Pillar marks the Mile from  Rome    And now the Sun to the bright Lion turns  And  Baja  with redoubled Fury burns  Then briny Seas and tasteful Springs farewel  Where FountainNymphs confus'd with  Nereids  dwell  In Winter You may all the World despise  But now 'tis  Tivoli  that bears the Prize  The Natural Curiosities about  Naples  are as numerous and extraordinary as the Artificial I shall set them down as I have done the other without any regard to their Situation The Grotto  del Cani  is famous for the poisonous Steams which float within a Foot of its Surface The Sides of the Grotto are mark'd with Green as high as the Malignity of the Vapour reaches The common Experiments are as follow A Dog that has his Nose held in the Vapour loses all Signs of Life in a very little time but if carry'd into the open Air or thrown into a Neighbouring Lake he immediately recovers if he is not  quite gone A Torch Snuff and all goes out in a Moment when dipp'd into the Vapour A Pistol cannot take Fire in it I split a Reed and laid in the Channel of it a Train of Gunpowder so that one End of the Reed was above the Vapour and the other at the Bottom of it and I found tho' the Steam was strong enough to hinder a Pistol from taking Fire in it and to quench a lighted Torch that it could not intercept the Train of Fire when it had once begun Flashing nor hinder it from running to the very End This Experiment I repeated twice or thrice to see if I could quite dissipate the Vapour which I did in so great a measure that one might easily let off a Pistol in it I observ'd how long a Dog was in Expiring the first time and after his Recovery and found no sensible difference A Viper bore it Nine Minutes the first time we put it in and Ten the Second When we brought it out after the first Trial it took such a vast quantity of Air into its Lungs that it swell'd almost twice as big as before and it was perhaps on this Stock of Air that it liv'd a Minute longer the second time Doctor  Connor  made a Discourse in one of the Academies at  Rome  upon the Subject of this  Grotto which he has since Printed in  England  He attributes the Death of Animals and the Extinction of Lights to a great Rarefaction of the Air caus'd by the Heat and Eruption of the Steams But how is it possible for these Steams tho' in never so great quantity to resist the Pressure of the whole Atmosphere And as for the Heat it is but very inconsiderable However to satisfie my self I plac'd a thin Viol well stopp'd up with Wax within the Smoak of the Vapour which would certainly have burst in an Air rarefy'd enough to kill a Dog or quench a Torch but nothing follow'd upon it However to take away all further Doubt I borrow'd a Weatherglass and so fix'd it in the Grotto that the  Stagnum  was wholly cover'd with the Vapour but I could not perceive the Quicksilver sunk after half an Hour's standing in it This Vapour is generally suppos'd to be Sulphureous tho' I can see no Reason for such a Supposition He that dips his Hand in it finds no Smell that it leaves upon it and tho' I put a whole Bundle of lighted Brimstone Matches to the Smoak they all went out in an Instant as if immers'd in Water Whatever is the Composition of the Vapour let it  have but one Quality of being very Glewy or Viscous and I believe it will mechanicaly solve all the  Phaenomena  of the Grotto It's Unctuousness will make it heavy and unfit for mounting higher than it does unless the Heat of the Earth which is just strong enough to agitate and bear it up at a little distance from the Surface were much greater than it is to rarifie and scatter it It will be too gross and thick to keep the Lungs in play for any time so that Animals will die in it sooner or later as their Blood Circulates slower or faster Fire will live in it no longer than in Water because it wraps it self in the same manner about the Flame and by its Continuity hinders any quantity of Air or Nitre from coming to its Succour The Parts of it however are not so compact as those of Liquors nor therefore tenacious enough to intercept the Fire that has once caught a Train of GunPowder for which Reason they may be quite broken and dispers'd by the Repetition of this Experiment There is an unctuous clammy Vapour that arises from the Stum of Grapes when they lye mash'd together in the Vat which puts out a Light when dipp'd into it and perhaps would take away  the Breath of weaker Animals were it put to the Trial  It would be endless to reckon up the different Baths to be met with in a Country that so much abounds in Sulphur There is scarce a Disease which has not one adapted to it A Stranger is generally led into that they call  Cicero  's Bath and several VoyageWriters pretend there is a cold Vapour rising from the Bottom of it which refreshes those who stoop into it 'Tis true the Heat is much more supportable to one that stoops than to one that stands upright because the Steams of Sulphur gather in the Hollow of the Arch about a Man's Head and are therefore much thicker and warmer in that Part than at the Bottom The Three Lakes of  Agnano    Avernus  and the  Lucrin  have now nothing in them particular The  Monte Novo  was thrown out by an Eruption of Fire that happen'd in the Place where now the Mountain stands The  Sulfatara  is very surprising to one who has not seen Mount  Vesuvio  But there is nothing about  Naples  nor indeed in any Part of  Italy  which deserves our Admiration so much as this Mountain I must confess the Idea I had of it did not answer the real Image  of the Place when I came to see it I shall therefore give the Description of it as it then lay  This Mountain stands at about Six  English  Miles distance from  Naples  tho' by reason of its Height it seems much nearer to those that survey it from the Town In our Way to it we pass'd by what was one of those Rivers of burning Matter that ran from it in a late Eruption This looks at a distance like a new plow'd Land but as you come near it you see nothing but a long Heap of heavy disjointed Clods lying one upon another There are innumerable Cavities and Interstices among the several Pieces so that the Surface is all broken and irregular Sometimes a great Fragment stands like a Rock above the rest sometimes the whole Heap lyes in a kind of Channel and in other Places has nothing like Banks to confine it but rises Four or Five Foot high in the open Air without spreading abroad on either side This I think is a plain Demonstration that these Rivers were not as they are usually represented so many Streams of running Matter for how could a Liquid that lay hardening by degrees settle in such a furrow'd uncompact Surface Were the River a  Confusion of never so many different Bodies if they had been all actually dissolved they would at least have form'd one continu'd Crust as we see the  Scorium  of Metals always gathers into a solid Piece let it be compounded of a Thousand Heterogeneous Parts I am apt to think therefore that these huge unwiel'dy Lumps that now lye one upon another as if thrown together by Accident remain'd in the melted Matter rigid and unliquify'd floating in it like Cakes of Ice in a River and that as the Fire and Ferment gradually abated they adjusted themseves together as well as their irregular Figures would permit and by this means fell into such an interrupted disorderly Heap as we now find it What was the melted Matter lyes at the Bottom out of sight After having quitted the Side of this long Heap which was once a Stream of Fire we came to the Roots of the Mountain and had a very troublesome March to gain the Top of it It is cover'd on all Sides with a kind of burnt Earth very dry and crumbled into Powder as if it had been artificially sifted It is very hot under the Feet and mix'd with several burnt Stones and Cakes of Cinders which have been thrown out at different times A Man  sinks almost a Foot in the Earth and generally loses half a Step by sliding backwards When we had climb'd this Mountain we discover'd the Top of it to be a wide naked Plain smoaking with Sulphur in several Places and probably undermin'd with Fire for we concluded it to be hollow by the Sound it made under our Feet In the midst of this Plain stands a high Hill in the shape of a Sugarloaf so very steep that there would be no mounting or descending it were not it made up of such a loose crumbled Earth as I have before described The Air of this Place must be very much impregnated with Saltpeter as appears by the Specks of it on the Sides of the Mountain where one can scarce find a Stone that has not the Top white with it After we had with much ado conquer'd this Hill we saw in the midst of it the present Mouth of  Vesuvio  that goes shelving down on all Sides 'till above a Hundred Yards deep as near as we could guess and has about Three or Four Hundred in the Diameter for it seems a perfect Round This vast Hollow is generally fill'd with Smoak but by the Advantage of a Wind that blew for us we had a very clear and distinct sight of it The Sides  appear all over stain'd with Mixtures of White Green Red and Yellow and have several Rocks standing out of them that look like pure Brimstone The Bottom was entirely cover'd and tho' we look'd very narrowly we could see nothing like a Hole in it the Smoak breaking through several imperceptible Cracks in many Places The very Middle was firm Ground when we saw it as we concluded from the Stones we flung upon it and I question not but one might then have cross'd the Bottom and have gone up on the other Side of it with very little Danger unless from some accidental Breath of Wind In the late Eruptions this great Hollow was like a vast Caldron fill'd with glowing and melted Matter which as it boil'd over in any Part ran down the Sides of the Mountain and made Five such Rivers as that beforemention'd In proportion as the Heat slacken'd this burning Matter must have subsided within the Bowels of the Mountain and as it sunk very leisurely had time to Cake together and form the Bottom which covers the Mouth of that dreadful Vault that lyes underneath it The next Eruption or Earthquake will probably break in Pieces this false Bottom and  quite change the present Face of Things  This whole Mountain shaped like a Sugarloaf has been made at several times by the prodigious Quantities of Earth and Cinders which have been flung up out of the Mouth that lyes in the midst of them so that it encreases in Bulk at every Eruption the Ashes still falling down the Sides of it like the Sand in an HourGlass A Gentleman of  Naples  told me that in his Memory it had gain'd Twenty Foot in Thickness and I question not but in length of time it will cover the whole Plain and make one Mountain with that on which it now stands  In those Parts of the Sea that are not far from the Roots of this Mountain they find sometimes a very fragrant Oil which is sold dear and makes a rich Perfume The Surface of the Sea is for a little Space cover'd with its Bubbles during the time that it rises which they skim off into their Boats and afterwards set a separating in Pots and Jars They say its Sources never run but in a calm warm Weather The Agitations of the Water perhaps hinder them from discovering it at other times  Among the Natural Curiosities of  Naples  I cannot forbear mentioning their manner of furnishing the Town with Snow which they here use instead of Ice because as they say it cools or congeals any Liquor sooner There is a great Quantity of it consum'd yearly for they drink very few Liquors not so much as Water that have not lain in  Fresco  and every Body from the highest to the lowest makes use of it insomuch that a Scarcity of Snow would raise a Mutiny at  Naples  as much as a Dearth of Corn or Provisions in another Country To prevent this the King has sold the Monopoly of it to certain Persons who are oblig'd to furnish the City with it all the Year at so much the Pound They have a high Mountain at about Eighteen Miles from the Town which has several Pits dug into it Here they employ many poor People at such a Season of the Year to roll in vast Balls of Snow which they ram together and cover from the Sunshine Out of these Reservoirs of Snow they cut several Lumps as they have occasion for them and send them on Asses to the Seaside where they are carry'd off in Boats and distributed to several Shops at a settled Price that from time to time  supply the whole City of  Naples  While the  Banditti  continu'd their Disorders in this Kingdom they often put the SnowMerchants under Contribution and threaten'd them if they appear'd tardy in their Payments to destroy their Magazines which they say might easily have been effected by the Infusion of some Barrels of Oil  It would have been tedious to have put down the many Descriptions that the  Latin  Poets have made of several of the Places mention'd in this Chapter I shall therefore conclude it with the general Map which  Silius Italicus  has given us of this great Bay of  Naples  Most of the Places he mentions lye within the same Prospect and if I have pass'd over any of them it is because I shall take them in my Way by Sea from  Naples  to  Rome  Stagna inter celebrem nunc mitia monstrat Avernum  Tum tristi nemore atque umbris nigrantibus horrens  Et formidatus volucri lethale vomebat  Suffuso

he wrote his Poem because  Agrippa  who liv'd between  Hannibal  and  Silius  had cut down the Woods that enclos'd the Lake and hinder'd these noxious Steams from dissipating which were immediately scatter'd as soon as the Winds and fresh Air were let in among them  THE ISLE of CAPREA  _HAving stay'd longer at  Naples  than I at first design'd I could not dispense with my self from making a little Voyage to the Isle of  Caprea  as being very desirous to see a Place which had been the Retirement of  Augustus  for some time and the Residence of  Tiberius  for several Years The Island lyes Four Miles in Length from East to West and about one in Breadth The Western Part for about Two Miles in Length is a continu'd Rock vastly high and inaccessible on the Seaside It has however the greatest Town in the Island that goes under the Name of  AnoCaprea  and is in several Places cover'd with a very fruitful Soil The Eastern End of the Isle rises up in Precipices very near as high tho' not quite so long as the Western Between these Eastern and Western Mountains lyes a Slip of lower Ground which runs across the Island and is one of the pleasantest Spots  I have seen It is hid with Vines Figs Oranges Almonds Olives Myrtles and Fields of Corn which look extremely fresh and beautiful and make up the most delightful little Landskip imaginable when they are survey'd from the Tops of the neighbouring Mountains Here stands the Town of  Caprea  the Bishop's Palace and Two or Three Convents In the midst of this fruitful Tract of Land rises a Hill that was probably cover'd with Buildings in  Tiberius  's Time There are still several Ruins on the Sides of it and about the Top are found Two or Three dark Galleries low built and cover'd with Mason's Work tho' at present they appear overgrown with Grass I enter'd one of 'em that is a Hundred Paces in Length I observed as some of the Countrymen were digging into the Sides of this Mountain that what I took for solid Earth was only Heaps of Brick Stone and other Rubbish skinn'd over with a Covering of Vegetables But the most considerable Ruin is that which stands on the very Extremity of the Eastern Promontory where are still some Apartments left very high and arch'd at Top I have not indeed seen the Remains of any ancient  Roman  Buildings that have  not been Roof'd with either Vaults or Arches The Rooms I am mentioning stand deep in the Earth and have nothing like Windows or Chimnies which makes me think they were formerly either Bathing Places or Reservoirs of Water An old Hermit lives at present among the Ruins of this Palace who lost his Companion a few Years ago by a Fall from the Precipice He told me they had often found Medals and Pipes of Lead as they dug among the Rubbish and that not many Years ago they discover'd a pav'd Road running under Ground from the Top of the Mountain to the Seaside which was afterwards confirm'd to me by a Gentleman of the Island There is a very noble Prospect from this Place On the one side lyes a vast Extent of Seas that runs abroad further than the Eye can reach Just opposite stands the Green Promontory of  Surrentum  and on the other side the whole Circuit of the Bay of  Naples  This Prospect according to  Tacitus  was more agreeable before the burning of  Vesuvio  that Mountain probably which after the first Eruption look'd like a great Pile of Ashes was in  Tiberius  's Time shaded with Woods and Vineyards for I think  Martial  's Epigram  may here serve as a Comment to  Tacitus  Hic est pampineis viridis Vesuvius umbris  Presserat hic madidos nobilis uva lacus  Haec juga quàm Nisae colles plùs Bacchus amavit  Hoc nuper Satyri monte dedere choros  Haec Veneris sedes Lacedaemone gratior illi  Hic locus Herculeo nomine clarus erat  Cuncta jacent flammis tristi mersa favillâ  Nec superi vellent hoc licuisse sibi  L Ep  Vesuvio  cover'd with the fruitful Vine  Here flourish'd once and ran with Floods of Wine  Here  Bacchus  oft to the cool Shades retir'd  And his own Native  Nisa  less admir'd  Oft to the Mountain's airy Tops advanc'd  The frisking Satyrs on the Summets danc'd  Alcides  here here  Venus  grac'd the Shore  Nor lov'd her Fav'rite  Lacedaemon  more  Now Piles of Ashes spreading all around  In undistinguish'd Heaps deform the Ground  The Gods themselves the ruin'd Seats bemoan  And blame the Mischiefs that themselves have done  This View must still have been more pleasant when the whole Bay was encompass'd with so long a Range of Buildings that it appear'd to those who look'd on it at a distance but as one continu'd City On both the Shores of that fruitful Bottom which I have before mention'd are still to be seen the Marks of ancient Edifices Particularly on that which looks towards the South there is a little kind of Mole which seems to have been the Foundation of a Palace unless we may suppose that the  Pharos  of  Caprea  stood there which  Statius  takes notice of in his Poem that invites his Wife to  Naples  and is I think the most natural among the  Silvae  Nec desunt variae circùm oblectamina vitae  Sive Vaporiferas blandissima littora Bajas  Enthea fatidicae seu visere tecta Sibyllae  Dulce sit Iliacoque jugum memorabile remo  Seu tibi Bacchei vineta madentia Gauri  Teleboumque domos trepidis ubi dulcia nautis  Lumina noctivagae tollit Pharus aemulae luna  Caraque non molli juga Surrentina Lyaeo  L  The blissful Seats with endless Pleasures flow  Whether to  Baja  's Sunny Shores you go  And view the Sulphur to the Baths convey'd  Or the dark Grotte of the Prophetick Maid  Or steep  Miseno  from the  Trojan  nam'd  Or  Gaurus  for its flowing Vintage fam'd  Or  Caprea  where the Lanthorn fix'd on high  Shines like a Moon through the benighted Sky  While by its Beams the wary Sailor steers  Or where  Surrentum  clad in Vines appears  They found in  AnoCaprea  some Years ago a Statue and a rich Pavement under Ground as they had occasion to turn up the Earth that lay upon 'em One still sees on the Bendings of these Mountains the Marks of several ancient Scales of Stairs by which they us'd to ascend 'em The whole Island is so unequal that there were but few Diversions to be found in it without Doors but what recommended it most to  Tiberius  was its wholsome Air which is warm in Winter and cool in Summer and its inaccessible Coasts which are generally so very steep that a handful of Men might defend 'em against a powerful Army  We need not doubt but  Tiberius  had his different Residences according as the Seasons of the Year and his different Sets of Pleasure requir'd  Suetonius  says  Duodecim Villas totidem nominibus ornavit  The whole Island was probably cut into several easie Ascents planted with Variety of Palaces and adorn'd with as great a Multitude of Groves and Gardens as the Situation of the Place would suffer The Works under Ground were however more extraordinary than those above it For the Rocks were all undermin'd with Highways Grotto's  Galleries Bagnio's and several Subterraneous Retirements that suited with the Brutal Pleasures of the Emperor One would indeed very much wonder to see such small Appearances of the many Works of Art that were formerly to be met with in this Island were we not told that the  Romans  after the Death of  Tiberius  sent hither an Army of Pioneers on purpose to Demolish the Buildings and deface the Beauties of the Island  In sailing round  Caprea  we were entertain'd with many rude Prospects of Rocks and Precipices that rise in several Places half a Mile high in Perpendicular At the Bottom of 'em are Caves and Grotto's form'd by the continual breaking of the Waves upon 'em I enter'd one which the Inhabitants call  Grotto Oscuro  and after the Light of the Sun was a little worn off my Eyes could see all the Parts of it distinctly by a glimmering Reflection that play'd upon 'em from the Surface of the Water The Mouth is low and narrow but after having enter'd pretty far in the Grotto opens it self on both Sides in an oval Figure of an Hundred Yeads from one Extremity to the other as we were toln for it would not have  been safe measuring of it The Roof is vaulted and Distils fresh Water from every Part of it which fell upon us as fast as the first Droppings of a Shower The Inhabitants and  Neapolitans  who have heard of  Tiberius  's Grotto's will have this to be one of 'em but there are several Reasons that show it to be natural For besides the little use we can conceive of such a dark Cavern of Salt Waters there are no where any Marks of the Chissel the Sides are of a soft mouldering Stone and one sees many of the like hollow Spaces worn in the Bottoms of the Rocks as they are more or less able to resist the Impressions of the Water that beats against 'em  Not far from this Grotto lye the  Sirenum Scopuli  which  Virgil  and  Ovid  mention in  Aeneas  's Voyage they are Two or Three sharp Rocks that stand about a Stone's Throw from the Southside of the Island and are generally beaten by Waves and Tempests which are much more violent on the South than on the North of  Caprea  Jamque adeo Scopulos Sirenum advecta subibat  Difficiles quondam multorumque ossibus albos  Tum rauca assiduo longè sale saxa sonabant  Aen  Glides by the  Syren  's Cliffs a shelfy Coast  Long infamous for Ships and Sailors lost  And white with Bones Th' impetuous Ocean roars  And Rocks rebellow from the sounding Shores  Dryden  I have before said that they often find Medals in this Island Many of those they call the  Spintriae  which  Aretin  has copy'd have been dug up here I know none of the Antiquaries that have written on this Subject and find nothing satisfactory of it where I thought it most likely to be met with in  Patin  's Edition of  Suetonius  illustrated by Medals Those I have convers'd with about it are of Opinion they were made to ridicule the Brutality of  Tiberius  tho' I cannot but believe they were stamp'd by his Order They are unquestionably Antique and no bigger than Medals of the Third Magnitude They bear on one Side some lewd Invention of that Hellish Society which  Suetonius  calls  Monstrosi concubitûs repertores  and on the other the Number of the Medal I have seen of 'em as high as to Twenty I can't  think they were made as a Jest on the Emperor because Raillery on Coins is of a Modern Date I know but Two in the Upper Empire besides the  Spintriae  that lye under any Suspicion of it The first is one of  Marcus Aurelius  where in Compliment to the Emperor and Empress they have stamp'd on the Reverse the Figure of  Venus  caressing  Mars  and endeavouring to detain him from the Wars  VENERI VICTRICI  Quoniam belli fera maenera Mavors  Armipotens regit in gremium qui saepe Tuum se  Rejicit aeterno devinctus volnere amoris  Lucr L  The  Venus  has  Faustina  's Face her Lover is a naked Figure with a Helmet on his Head and a Shield on his Arm  Tu scabie frueris mali quod in Aggere rodit  Qui tegitur parmâ galeâ  Juv Sat  This unluckily brings to Mind  Faustina  's Fondness for the Gladiator and is therefore interpreted by many as a hidden Piece of Satyr But besides that such a Thought was inconsistent with the Gravity of a Senate how can one imagine that the Fathers would have dar'd Affront the Wife of  Aurelius  and the Mother of  Commodus  or that they could think of giving Offence to an Empress whom they afterwards deify'd and to an Emperor that was the Darling of the Army and People  The other Medal is a Golden one of  Gallienus  preserv'd in the  French  King's Cabinet it is inscrib'd  Gallienae Augustae    Pax Ubique  and was stamp'd at a time when the Emperor's Father was in Bondage and the Empire torn in Pieces by several Pretenders to it Yet if one considers the strange Stupidity of this Emperor with the senseless Security which  appears in several of his Sayings that are still left on Record one may very well believe this Coin was of his own Invention We may be sure if Raillery had once enter'd the old  Roman  Coins we should have been overstock'd with Medals of that Nature if we consider there were often Rival Emperors proclaim'd at the same time who endeavour'd at the lessening of each others Character and that most of 'em were succeeded by such as were Enemies to their Predecessor These Medals of  Tiberius  were never current Mony but rather of the Nature of Medalions which seem to have been made on purpose to perpetuate the Discoveries of that infamous Society  Suetonius  tells us that their monstrous Inventions were Register'd several ways and preserv'd in the Emperor's private Apartments  Cubicula plurifariam disposita tabellis ac Sigillis lascivissimarum picturarum figurarum adornavit librisque Elephantidis instruxit ne cui in Operá edendâ exemplar impetratae Schemae deesset  The  Elephantis  here mention'd is probably the some  Martial  takes notice of for her Book of Postures  In Sabellum  Facundos mihi de libidinosis  Legisti nimium Sabelle versus  Quales nec Didymi sciunt puellae  Nec molles Elephantidos libelli  Sunt illic Veneris novae figurae  Quales c Lib Ep  Ovid  mentions the same kind of Pictures that found a Place even in  Augustius  's Cabinet  Scilicet in domibus vestris ut prisca virorum  Artifici fulgent corpora picta manu  Sic quae concubitus varios Venerisque figuras  Exprimat est aliquo parva tabella loco  De Trist Lib  There are several of the  Sigilla  or Seals  Suetonius  speaks of to be met with in Collections of ancient  Intaglio's  But I think what puts it beyond all doubt that these Coins were rather made by the Emperor's Order than as a Satyr on him is because they are now  found in the very Place that was the Scene of these his unnatural Lusts  Quem rupes Caprearum tetra latebit  Incesto possessa Seni  Cl de to Cons Hon  Who has not heard of  Caprea  's guilty Shore  Polluted by the Rank old Emperor  FROM NAPLES TO ROME by SEA  _I Took a Falucca at  Naples  to carry me to  Rome  that I might not be forc'd to run over the same Sights a Second time and might have an Opportunity of seeing many things in a Road which our VoyageWriters have not so particularly describ'd As in my Journey from  Rome  to  Naples  I had  Horace  for my Guide so I had the Pleasure of seeing my Voyage from  Naples  to  Rome  described by  Virgil  It is indeed much easier to trace out the Way  Aeneas  took than that of  Horace  because  Virgil  has mark'd it out by Capes Islands and other Parts of Nature which are not so subject to change  or decay as are Towns Cities and the Works of Art Mount  Pausilypo  makes a beautiful Prospect to those who pass by it At a small distance from it lyes the little Island of  Nisida  adorned with a great Variety of Plantations rising one above another in so beautiful an Order that the whole Island looks like a large TerraceGarden It has Two little Ports and is not at present troubled with any of those noxious Steams that  Lucan  mentions  Tali spiramine Nesis  Emittit Stygium nebulosis Aēra saxis  Lib  Nesi  's high Rocks such  Stygian  Air produce  And the blue breathing Pestilence diffuse  From  Nifida  we row'd to Cape  Miseno  The Extremity of this Cape has a long Cleft in it which was enlarg'd and cut into Shape by  Agrippa  who made this the great Port for the  Roman  Fleet that serv'd in the Mediterranean as that of  Ravenna  held the Ships design'd for the  Adriatic  and  Archipelago  The highest End of this Promontory  rises in the fashion of a Sepulchre or Monument to those that survey it from the Land which perhaps might occasion  Virgil  's burying  Misenus  under it I have seen a grave  Italian  Author who has written a very large Book on the  Campania Felice  that from  Virgil  's Descrption of this Mountain concludes it was call'd  Aërius  before  Misenus  had given it a new Name  At pius Aeneas ingenti mole Sepulchrum  Imponit suaque arma viro remumque tubamque  Monte sub Aerio qui nunc Misenus ab illo  Dicitur aeternumque tenet per saecula nomen  Aen L  There are still to be seen a few Ruins of old  Misenum  but the most considerable Antiquity of the Place is a Sett of Galleries that are hewn into the Rock and are much more spacious than the  Piscina Mirabilis  Some will have them to have been a Reservoir of Water but others more probably suppose them to have been  Nero  's Baths I lay the first Night on the Isle of  Procita  which is pretty well cultivated and contains about Four Thousand Inhabitants who  are all Vassals to the Marquis  de Vasto  The next Morning I went to see the Isle of  Ischia  that stands further out into the Sea The ancient Poets call it  Inarime  and lay  Typhaeus  under it by reason of its Eruptions of Fire There has been no Eruption for near these Three Hundred Years The last was very terrible and destroy'd a whole City At present there are scarce any Marks left of a Subterraneous Fire for the Earth is cold and overrun with Grass and Shrubs where the Rocks will suffer it There are indeed several little Cracks in it thro' which there issues a constant Smoke but 'tis probable this arises from the warm Springs that feed the many Baths with which this Island is plentifully stock'd I observ'd about one of these Breathing Passages a Spot of Myrtles that flourish within the Steam of these Vapours and have a continual Moisture hanging upon them On the South of  Ischia  lyes a round Lake of about Three Quarters of a Mile Diameter separate from the Sea by a narrow Tract of Land It was formerly a  Roman  Port On the North End of the Island stands the Town and Castle on an exceeding high Rock divided from  the Body of the Island and inaccessible to an Enemy on all Sides This Island is larger but much more Rocky and Barren than  Procita Virgil  makes them both shake at the Fall of part of the Mole of  Bajae  that stood at a few Miles distance from them  Qualis in Euböico Bajarum littore quondam  Saxea pila cadit magnis quam molibus ante  Constructam jaciunt pelago Sic illa ruinam  Prona trahit penitusque vadis illisa recumbit  Miscent se maria et nigrae attolluntur arenae  T'um sonitu Prochita alta tremit durumque cubile  Inarime Jovis Imperiis imposta Typhaeo  Aen  Not with less Ruin than the  Bajan  Mole  Rais'd on the Seas the Surges to control  At once comes tumbling down the rocky Wall  Prone to the Deep the Stones disjointed fall  Off the vast Pile the scatter'd Ocean flies  Black Sands discolour'd Froth and mingled Mud arise  The frighted Billows roll and seek the Shores  Trembles high  Prochyta  and  Ischia  roars  Typhaeus  roars beneath by  Jove  's Command  Astonish'd at the Flaw that shakes the Land  Soon shifts his weary Side and scarce awake  With Wonder feels the Weight press lighter on his Back  Dryden  I don't see why  Virgil  in this noble Comparison has given the Epithet of  Alta  to  Procita  for it is not only no high Island in it self but is much lower than  Ischia  and all the Points of Land that lye within its Neighbourhood I should think  Alta  was join'd adverbially with  Tremit  did  Virgil  make use of so Equivocal a Syntax I cannot forbear inserting in this Place the lame Imitation  Silius Italicus  has made of the foregoing Passage  Haud aliter structo Tyrrhena ad littora Saxo  Pugnatura fretis subter caecisque procellis  Pila immane sonans impingitur ardua ponto  Immugit Nereus divisaque caerula pulsu  Illisum accipiunt irata sub aequora montem  L  So a vast Fragment of the  Bajan  Mole  That fix'd amid the  Tyrrhene  Waters braves  The beating Tempests and insulting Waves  Thrown from its Basis with a dreadful Sound  Dashes the broken Billows all around  And with resistless Force the Surface cleaves  That in its angry Waves the falling Rock receives  The next Morning going to  Cumae  thro' a very pleasant Path by the  Mare Mortuum  and the  Elisian  Fields we saw in our Way a great many Ruins of Sepulchres and other ancient Edifices  Cumae  is at present utterly destitute of Inhabitants so much is it chang'd since  Lucan  's Time if the Poem to  Piso  be his  Acidaliâ quae condidit Alite muros  Euboicam referens faecunda Neapolis urbem  Where the fam'd Walls of fruitful  Naples  lye  That may for Multitudes with  Cuma  vie  They show here the Remains of  Apollo  's Temple which all the Writers of the Antiquities of this place suppose to have been the same  Virgil  describes in his Sixth  Aeneid  as built by  Daedalus  and that the very Story which  Virgil  there mentions was actually Engraven on the Front of it  Redditus his primùm terris tibi PhoebeSacravit  Remigium Alarum posuitque immania Templa  In foribus lethum Androgeo tum pendere paenas  Cecropidae jussi miserum

Athens  yearly sent to meet  The Fate appointed by revengeful  Crete    And next to those the dreadful Urn was plac'd  In which the destin'd Names by Lots were cast  Dryden  Among other Subterraneous Works there is the beginning of a Passage which is stopp'd up within less than a Hundred Yards of the Entrance by the Earth that is fallen into it They suppose it to have been the other Mouth of the  Sibyl  's Grotto It lyes indeed in the same Line with the Entrance near the  Avernus  is fac'd alike with the  Opus Reticulatum  and has still the Marks  of Chambers that have been cut into the Sides of it Among the many Fables and Conjectures which have been made on this Grotto I think it is highly probable that it was once inhabited by such as perhaps thought it a better Shelter against the Sun than any other kind of Building or at least that it was made with smaller Trouble and Expence As for the Mosaic and other Works that may be found in it they may very well have been added in later Ages according as they thought fit to put the Place to different Uses The Story of the  Cimmerians  is indeed clogg'd with Improbabilities as  Strabo  relates it but it is very likely there was in it some Foundation of Truth  Homer  's Description of the  Cimmerians  whom he places in these Parts answers very well to the Inhabitants of such a long dark Cavern  The gloomy Race in Subterraneous Cells  Among surrounding Shades and Darkness dwells  Hid in th' unwholsome Covert of the Night  Theyshun th' Approaches of the chearful Light  The Sun ne'er visits their obscure Retreats  Nor when he runs his Course nor when he sets  Unhappy Mortals  Odys L  Tu quoque littoribus nostris Aeneia nutrix  Aeternam mortens fomam Cajeta dedisti  Et nunc servat honos sedem tuus ossaque nomen  Hesperiâ in magnâ si qua est ea gloria signat  Aen  And thou O Matron of Immortal Fame  Here dying to the Shore hast left thy Name  Cajeta  still the Place is call'd from Thee  The Nurse of great  Aeneas'  Infancy  Here rest thy Bones in rich  Hesperia  's Plains  Thy Name 'tis all a Ghost can have remains  Dryden  I saw at  Cajeta  the Rock of Marble said to be cleft by an Earthquake at our Saviour's Death There is written over the Chappel Door that leads into the Crack the Words of the Evangelist  Ecce terraemotus factus est magnus  I believe every one who sees this vast Rent in so high a Rock and observes how exactly the Convex Parts of one Side tally with the Concave of the other must be satisfy'd that it was the Effect of an Earthquake tho' I question not but it either happen'd long before the Time of the  Latin  Writers or in the darker Ages since for otherwise I cannot but think they would have taken notice of its Original The Port Town Castle and Antiquities of this Place have been often describ'd  We touch'd next at  Monte Circeio  which  Homer  calls  Insula Aeëa  whether it be that it was formerly an Island or that the  Greek  Sailors of his Time thought it so It is certain they might easily have been deceived by its appearance as being a very high Mountain join'd to the main Land by a narrow Tract of Earth that is many Miles in Length and almost of a Level with the Surface of the Water The End of this Promontory is very rocky and mightily expos'd to the Winds and Waves which perhaps gave the first Rise to the Howlings of Wolves and the Roarings of Linos that us'd to be heard thence This I had a very lively Idea of being forc'd  to lye under it a whole Night  Virgil  's Description of  Aeneas  passing by this Coast can never be enough admir'd It is worth while to observe how to heighten the Horror of the Description he has prepar'd the Reader's Mind by the Solemnity of  Cajeta  's Funeral and the dead Stillness of the Night  At pius exequiis Aeneas rite solutis  Aggere composito tumuli postquam alta quiêrunt  Aequora tendit iter velis portumque relinquit  Adspirant aurae in noctem nec candida cursus  Luna negat Splendet tremulo sub lumine pontus

Atque fugam dedit et praeter vada fervida vexit  Aen L  Now when the Prince her Fun'ral Rites had paid  He plow'd the  Tyrrhene  Seas with Sails display'd  From Land a gentle Breeze arose by Night  Serenely shone the Stars the Moon was bright  And the Sea trembled with her Silver Light  Now near the Shelves of  Circe  's Shores they run    Circe  the rich the Daughter of the Sun  A dang'rous Coast The Goddess wastes her Days  In joyous Songs the Rocks resound her Lays  In Spinning or the Loom she spends her Night  And Cedar Brands supply her Father's Light  From hence were heard rebellowing to the Main  The Roars of Lions that refuse the Chain  The Grunts of bristled Boars and Groans of Bears  And Herds of Howling Wolves that stun the Sailor's Ears  These from their Caverns at the Close of Night  Fill the sad Isle with Horror and Affright  Darkling they mourn their Fate whom  Circe  's Pow'r  That watch'd the Moon and Planetary Hour  With Words and wicked Herbs from Human kind  Had alter'd and in Brutal Shapes confin'd  Which Monsters lest the  Trojan  's Pious Host  Should bear or touch upon th' inchanted Coast  Propitious  Neptune  steer'd their Course by Night  With rising Gales that sped their happy Flight  Dryden  Virgil  calls this Promontory  Aeëae Insula Circes  in the Third  Aeneid  but 'tis  the Heroe and not the Poet that speaks It may however be look'd upon as an Intimation that he himself thought it an Island in  Aeneas  's Time As for the thick Woods which not only  Virgil  but  Homer  mentions in the beautiful Description that  Plutarch  and  Longinus  have taken notice of they are most of 'em grubb'd up since the Promontory has been cultivated and inhabited tho' there are still many Spots of it which show the natural Inclination of the Soil leans that way  The next Place we touch'd upon was  Nettuno  where we found nothing remarkable besides the extream Poverty and Laziness of the Inhabitans At Two Miles distance from it lye the Ruins of  Antium  that are spread over a great Circuit of Land There are still left the Foundations of several Buildings and what are always the last Parts that perish in a Ruin many Subterraneous Grotto's and Passages of a great Length The Foundations of  Nero  's Port are still to be seen It was altogether Artificial and compos'd of huge Moles running round it in a kind of Circular Figure except where the Ships were to enter and had about Three Quarters of a Mile in its shortest Diameter Tho' the making  of this Port must have cost prodigious Sums of Mony we find no Medal of it and yet the same Emperor has a Medal struck in his own Name for the Port of  Ostia  which in Reality was a Work of his Predecessor  Claudius  The last Pope was at considerable Charges to make a little kind of Harbour in this Place and to convey fresh Water to it which was one of the Artifices of the Grand Duke to divert his Holiness from his Project of making  Civitavecchia  a free Port There lyes between  Antium  and  Nettuno  a Cardinal's  Villa  which is one of the pleasantest for Walks Fountains Shades and Prospects that I ever saw  Antium  was formerly famous for the Temple of Fortune that stod in it All agree there were Two Fortunes worshipped here which  Suetonius  calls the  Fortunae Antiates  and  Martial  the  Sorores Antii  Some are of Opinion that by these Two Goddesses were meant the Two  Nemeses  one of which rewarded good Men as the other punish'd the wicked  Fabretti  and others are apt to believe that by the Two Fortunes were only meant in general the Goddess who sent Prosperity or she who sent Afflictions to Mankind and produce in their Behalf an ancient  Monument found in this very Place and superscrib'd  Fortunae Felici  which indeed may favour one Opinion as well as the other and shows at least they are not mistaken in the general Sense of their Division I don't know whether any Body has taken notice that this double Function of the Goddess gives a considerable Light and Beauty to the Ode which  Horace  has address'd to her The whole Poem is a Prayer to Fortune that she would prosper  Caesar  's Arms and confound his Enemies so that each of the Goddesses has her Task assign'd in the Poet's Prayer and we may observe the Invocation is divided between the Two Deities the first Line relating indifferently to either That which I have mark'd speaks to the Goddess of Prosperity or if you please to the  Nemesis  of the Good and the other to the Goddess of Adversity or to the  Nemesis  of the Wicked  O Diva gratum quae regis Antium  Praesens vel imo tollere de gradu  Mortale corpus  vel superbos  Vertere funeribus triumphos  c  Great Goddess  Antium  's Guardian Power  Whose Force is strong and quick to raise  The lowest to the highest Place  Or with a wond'rous Fall  To bring the Haughty lower    And turn proud Triumphs to a Funeral  c  Creech  If we take the first Interpretation of the Two Fortunes for the double  Nemesis  the Compliment to  Caesar  is the greater and the Fifth Stanza clearer than the Commentators usually make it for the  Clavi trabales cunei uncus liquidumque plumbum  were actually used in the Punishment of Criminals  Our next Stage brought us to the Mouth of the  Tiber  into which we enter'd with some Danger the Sea being generally very rough in these Parts where the River rushes into it The Season of the Year the Muddiness of the Stream with the many Green Trees hanging over it put me in Mind of the delightful Image that  Virgil  has given us when  Aeneas  took the first View of it  Atque hic Aeneas ingentem ex aequore lucum  Prospicit hunc inter fluvio Tiberinus amaeno  Vorticibus rapidis et multâ flavus arenâ  In mare prorumpit variae circumque supraque  Assuetae ripis volucres et

it stood whole and entire I shall therefore set down the Medal that I have before mention'd which represents it as it was formerly  AVGVSTI SPQR  It is worth while to compare  Juvenal  's Description of this Port with the Figure it makes on the Coin  Tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora moles  Tyrrhenamque Pharon porrectaque brachia rursus  Quae pelago occurrunt medio longèque relinquunt

the  Porrectaque brachia rursus  Quae pelago occurrunt medio longèque relinquunt  Italiam  as they retire from one another in the Compass they make 'till their Two Ends almost meet a Second time in the midst of the Waters where the Figure  of  Neptune  sits The Poet's Reflection on the Haven is very just since there are few Natural Ports better Landlock'd and closed on all Sides than this seems to have been The Figure of  Neptune  has a Rudder by him to mark the Convenience of the Harbour for Navigation as he is represented himself at the Entrance of it to show it stood in the Sea The Dolphin distinguishes him from a River  God  and figures out his Dominion over the Seas He holds the same Fish in his Hand on other Medals What it means we may learn from the  Greek  Epigram on the Figure of a  Cupid  that had a Dolphin in one Hand and a Flower in the other    A proper Emblem graces either Hand  In one he holds the Sea in one the Land  Half a Day more brought us to  Rome  thro' a Road that is commonly visited by Travellers  ROME  _IT is generally observ'd that Modern  Rome  stands higher than the Ancient some have computed it about Fourteen or Fifteen Feet taking one Place with another The Reason given for it is that the present City stands upon the Ruins of the former and indeed I have often observed that where any considerable Pile of Building stood anciently one still finds a rising Ground or a little kind of Hill which was doubtless made up out of the Fragments and Rubbish of the ruin'd Edifice But besides this particular Cause we may assign another that has very much contributed to the raising the Situation of several Parts of  Rome  It being certain the great Quantities of Earth that have been wash'd off from the Hills by the Violence of Showers have had no small share in it This any one may be sensible of who observes how far several Buildings that stand near the Roots of Mountains are sunk deeper in the Earth  than those that have been on the Tops of Hills or in open Plains for which Reason the present Face of  Rome  is much more Even and Level than it was formerly the same Cause that has rais'd the lower Grounds having contributed to sink those that were higher  There are in  Rome  Two Setts of Antiquities the Christian and the Heathen The former tho' of a fresher Date are so embroil'd with Fable and Legend that one receives but little Satisfaction from searching into them The other give a great deal of Pleasure to such as have met with them before in ancient Authors for a Man who is in  Rome  can scarce see an Object that does not call to Mind a Piece of a  Latin  Poet or Historian Among the Remains of Old  Rome  the Grandeur of the Commonwealth shows it self chiefly in Works that were either necessary or convenient such as Temples Highways Aqueducts Walls and Bridges of the City On the contrary the Magnificence of  Rome  under the Emperors is seen principally in such Works as were rather for Ostentation or Luxury than any real Usefulness or Necessity as in Baths Amphitheaters Circus's Obelisks Triumphant Pillars Arches and Mausoleums  for what they added to the Aqueducts was rather to supply their Baths and Naumachias and to embellish the City with Fountains than out of any real Necessity there was for them These several Remains have been so copiously describ'd by abundance of Travellers and other Writers particularly by those concern'd in the learned Collection of  Graevius  that it is very difficult to make any new Discoveries on so beaten a Subject There is however so much to be observ'd in so spacious a Field of Antiquities that it is almost impossible to survey them without taking new Hints and raising different Reflections according as a Mans natural Turn of Thoughts or the Course of his Studies direct him  No Part of the Antiquities of  Rome  pleas'd me so much as the ancient Statues of which there is still an incredible Variety The Workmanship is often the most exquisite of any thing in its kind A Man would wonder how it were possible for so much Life to enter into Marble as may be discover'd in some of the best of them and even in the meanest one has the Satisfaction of seeing the Faces Postures Airs and Dress of those that have liv'd so many Ages before us There is a strange Resemblance  between the Figures of the several Heathen Deities and the Descriptions that the  Latin  Poets have given us of them but as the first may be looked upon as the ancienter of the Two I question not but the  Roman  Poets were the Copiers of the  Greek  Statuaries Tho' on other Occasions we often find the Statuaries took their Subjects from the Poets The  Laocoon  is too known an Instance among many others that are to be met with at  Rome  In the  Villa Aldabrandina  are the Figures of an Old and Young Man engag'd together at the  Caestus  who are probably the  Dares  and  Entellus  of  Virgil  where by the way one may observe the Make of the ancient  Caestus  that it only consisted of so many large Thongs about the Hand without any thing like a Piece of Lead at the End of them as some Writers of Antiquities have falsely imagin'd  I question not but many Passages in the old Poets hint at several Parts of Sculpture that were in Vogue in the Author's Time tho' they are now never thought of and that therefore such Passages lose much of their Beauty in the Eye of a Modern Reader who does not look upon them in the same Light with the Author's Contemporaries I shall  only mention Two or Three out of  Juvenal  that his Commentators have not taken notice of The first runs thus  Multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan  Aut aliqua extiterint et sub Jove sed Jove nondum  Barbato  Sat  Some thin Remains of Chastity appear'd  Ev'n under  Jove  but  Jove  without a Beard  Dryden  I appeal to any Reader if the Humour here would not appear much more natural and unforced to a People that saw every Day some or other Statue of this God with a thick bushy Beard as there are still many of them extant at  Rome  than it can to us who have no such Idea of him especially if we consider there was in the same City a Temple Dedicated to the Young  Jupiter  call'd  Templum Vaejovis  where in all probability there stood the particular Statue of a  Vid Ov de fastis Li Ecl  Jupiter Imberbis Juvenal  in another Place makes his Flatterer compare the Neck of one that is  but feebly built to that of  Hercules  holding up  Antaeus  from the Earth  Et longum invalidi collum cervicibus aequat  Herculis Antaeum procul a tellure tenentis  Sat  His long Crane Neck and narrow Shoulders praise  You'd think they were describing  Hercules  Lifting  Anteus    Dryden  What a strain'd unnatural Similitude must this seem to a Modern Reader but how full of Humour if we suppose it alludes to any celebrated Statues of these Two Champions that stood perhaps in some publick Place or Highway near  Rome  And what makes it more than probable there were such Statues we meet with the Figures which  Juvenal  here describes on Antique Intaglio's and Medals Nay  Propertius  has taken notice of the very Statues  Luctantum in pulvere signa  Herculis Antaeique  Lib Car  Antaeus  here and stern  Alcides  strive  And both the grappling Statues seem to live  I cannot forbear observing here that the Turn of the Neck and Arms is often commended in the  Latin  Poets among the Beauties of a Man as in  Horace  we find both put together in that beautiful Description of Jealousie  Dum tu Lydia Telephi  Cervicem roseam et Cerea Telephi  Laudas Brachia vae meum  Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur  Tunc nec mens mihi nec color  Certa sede manent humor et in genas  Furtim labitur arguens  Quàm lentis penitus macerer ignibus  While  Telephus  's youthful Charms  His rosie Neck and winding Arms  With endless Rapture you recite  And in the tender Name delight  My Heart enrag'd by jealous Heats  With numberless Resentments beats  From my pale Cheeks the Colour flies  And all the Man within me dies  By fits my swelling Grief appears  In rising Sighs and falling Tears  That show too well the warm Desires  The silent slow consuming Fires  Which on my inmost Vitals prey  And melt my very Soul away  This we should be at a Loss to account for did we not observe in the Old  Roman  Statues that these Two Parts were always bare and expos'd to View as much as our Hands and Face are at present I cannot leave  Juvenal  without taking notice that his  Ventilat aestivum digitis sudantilius  Nec sufferre queat majoris pondera Gem    Sat  Charg'd with light Summor Rings his Fingers sweat  Unable to support a Gem of Weight  Dryden  was not anciently so great an Hyperbole as it is now for I have seen old  Roman  Rings so very thick about and with such large Stones in 'em that 'tis no Wonder a Fop should reckon 'em a little cumbersome in the Summer Season of so hot a Climate  It is certain that Satyr delights in such Allusions and Instances as are extreamly  natural and familiar When therefore we see any thing in an old Satyrist that looks forc'd and pedantick we ought to consider how it appear'd in the Time the Poet writ and whether or no there might not be some particular Circumstances to recommend it to the Readers of his own Age which we are now deprived of One of the finest ancient Statues in  Rome  is a  Meleager  with a Spear in his Hand and the Head of a Wild Boar on one Side of him It is of  Parian  Marble and as yellow as Ivory One meets with many other Figures of  Meleager  in the ancient  Basso Relievo's  and on the Sides of the  Sarcophagi  or Funeral Monuments Perhaps it was the Arms or Device of the old  Roman  Hunters which Conjecture I have found confirm'd in a Passage of  Manilius  that lets us know the Pagan Hunters had  Meleager  for their Patron as the Christians have their St  Hubert  He speaks of the constellation which makes a good SportsMan  Quibus aspirantibus orti  Te Meleagre colunt  Manil Lib  I question not but this sets a Verse in the Fifth Satyr of  Juvenal  in a much  better Light than if we suppose that the Poet aims only at the old Story of  Meleager  without considering it as so very common and familiar a one among the  Romans  Flavi dignus ferro Meleagri  Spumat aper  Juv S  A Boar intire and worthy of the Sword  Of  Meleager  smoaks upon the Board  Mr Bowles  In the beginning of the Ninth Satyr  Juvenal  asks his Friend why he looks like  Marsya  when he was overcome  Scire velim quare toties mihi Naevole tristis  Occurris fronte obductâ ceu Marsya victus  Tell me why saunt'ring thus from Place to Place  I meet thee  Nevolus  with a clouded Face  Dryden's Juvenal  Some of the Commentators tell us that  Marsya  was a Lawyer who had lost his Cause others say that this Passage alludes to the Story of the Satire  Marsyas  who contended with  Apollo  which I think is more humorous than the other  if we consider there was a famous Statue of  Apollo  fleaing  Marsya  in the midst of the  Roman Forum  as there are still several ancient Statues of  Rome  on the same Subject  There is a Passage in the Sixth Satyr of  Juvenal  that I could never tell what to make of 'till I had got the Interpretation of it from one of  Bellorio  's ancient  Basso Relievo's  Magnorum Artificum frangebat pocula miles  Ut phaleris gauderet Equus caelataque cassis  Romuleae simulacra ferae mansuescere jussae  Imperii fato et geminos sub rupe Quirinos  Ac nudam effigiem clypeo fulgentis et hastâ  Pendentisque Dei perituro ostenderet hosti  Juv Sat  Or else a Helmet for himself he made  Where various Warlike Figures were Inlaid  The  Roman  Wolf suckling the Twins was there  And  Mars  himself arm'd with his Shield and Spear  Hov'ring above his Crest did dreadful show  As threat'ning Death to each resisting Foe  Dryden's Juvenal  Juvenal  here describes the Simplicity of the old  Roman  Soldiers and the Figures that were generally Engraven on their Helmets The First of 'em was the Wolf giving Suck to  Romulus  and  Rhemus  The Second which is comprehended in the Two last Verses is not so Intelligible Some of the Commentators tell us that the God here mention'd is  Mars  that he comes to see his Two Sons sucking the Wolf and that the old Sculptors generally drew their Figures naked that they might have the Advantage of representing the different Swelling of the Muscles and the Turns of the Body But they are extremely at a Loss to know what is meant by the Word  Pendentis  some fancy it expresses only the great Embossment of the Figure others believe it hung off the Helmet in  Alto Relievo  as in the foregoing Translation  Lubin  supposes that the God  Mars  was Engraven on the Shield and that he is said to be hanging because the Shield which bore him hung on the Left Shoulder One of the old Interpreters is of Opinion that by hanging is only meant a Posture of bending forward to strike the Enemy Another will have it that whatever is placed on the Head may be said to hang as we call  hanging Gardens such as are planted on the Top of the House Several learned Men who like none of these Explications believe there has been a Fault in the Transcriber and that  Pendentis  ought to be  Perdentis  but they quote no Manuscript in Favour of their Conjecture The true Meaning of the Words is certainly as follows The  Roman  Soldiers who were not a little proud of their Founder and the Military Genius of their Republick us'd to bear on their Helmets the First History of  Romulus  who was begot by the God of War and suckled by a Wolf The Figure of the God was made as if descending upon the Priestess  Ilia  or as others call her  Rhea Silvia  The Occasion required his Body should be naked  Tu quoque inermis eras cum te formosa Sacerdos  Cepit ut huic urbi Semina magna dares  Ov de Fas L  Then too our mighty Sire thou stood'st disarm'd  When thy rapt Soul the lovely Priestess charm'd  That  Rome  's high Founder bore  tho' on other Occasions he is drawn as  Horace  has describ'd him  Tunicâ cinctum adamantinâ  The Sculptor however to distinguish him from the rest of the Gods gave him what the Medallists call his proper Attributes a Spear in one Hand and a Shield in the other As he was represented descending his Figure appear'd suspended in the Air over the Vestal Virgin in which Sense the Word  Pendentis  is extremely proper and Poetical Besides the Antique  Basso Relievo  that made me first think of this Interpretation I have since met with the same Figures on the Reverses of a couple of ancient Coins which were stamp'd in the Reign of  Antoninus Pius  as a Compliment to that Emperor whom for his Excellent Government and Conduct of the City of  Rome  the Senate regarded as a Second kind of Founder

emergit solo  Dextrâ ferocem cornibus premens taurum  Zetus  Sen OEdip Act  First  Zetus  rises through the Ground  Bending the Bull's tough Neck with Pain  That tosses back his Horns in vain  I cannot doubt but the Poet had here in view the Posture of  Zetus  in the famous Groupe of Figures which represents the Two Brothers binding  Dirce  to the Horns of a mad Bull  I could not forbear taking particular notice of the several Musical Instruments that are to be seen in the Hands of the  Apollo's  Muses Fauns Satyrs Bacchanais and Shepherds which might certainly give a great Light to the Dispute for Preference between the Ancient and  Modern Musick It would perhaps be no impertinent design to take off all their Models in Wood which might not only give us some Notion of the ancient Musick but help us to pleasanter Instruments than are now in use By the Appearance they make in Marble there is not One StringInstrument that seems comparable to our Violins for they are all play'd on either by the bare Fingers or the  Plectrum  so that they were incapable of adding any length to their Notes or of varying 'em by those insensible Swellings and wearings away of Sound upon the same String which give so wonderful a Sweetness to our Modern Musick Besides that the StringInstruments must have had very low and feeble Voices as may be guess'd from the small Proportion of Wood about 'em which could not contain Air enough to render the Strokes in any considerable measure full and sonorous There is a great deal of difference in the Make not only of the several kinds of Instruments but even among those of the same Name The  Syringa  for Example has sometimes Four and sometimes more Pipes as high as to Twelve The same Variety of Strings may be observed on their Harps and of Stops on their  Tibiae  which shows  the little Foundation that such Writers have gone upon who from a Verse perhaps in  Virgil  's Eclogues or a short Passage in a  Classic  Author have been so very nice in determining the precise Shape of the ancient Musical Instruments with the exact Number of their Pipes Strings and Stops It is indeed the usual Fault of the Writers of Antiquities to streighten and confine themselves to particular Models They are for making a kind of Stamp on every thing of the same Name and if they find any thing like an old Description of the Subject they Treat on they take care to regulate it on all Occasions according to the Figure it makes in such a single Passage As the learned  German  Author quoted by Monsieur  Baudelot  who had probably never seen any thing of a HousholdGod more than a  Canopus  affirms roundly that all the ancient  Lares  were made in the Fashion of a JugBottle In short the Antiquaries have been guilty of the same Fault as the SystemeWriters who are for cramping their Subjects into as narrow a Space as they can and for reducing the whole Extent of a Science into a few general Maxims This a Man has occasion of observing more than once in the several Fragments of Antiquity that are  still to be seen in  Rome  How many Dresses are there for each particular Deity What a Variety of Shapes in the ancient Urns Lamps Lachrymary Vessels  Priapus's  HousholdGods which have some of 'em been represented under such a particular Form as any one of 'em has been describ'd with in an ancient Author and would probably be all so were they not still to be seen in their own Vindication Madam  Dacier  from some old Cuts of  Terence  fancies that the  Larva  or  Persona  of the  Roman  Actors was not only a Vizard for the Face but had false Hair to it and came over the whole Head like a Helmet Among all the Statues at  Rome  I remember to have seen but Two that are the Figures of Actors which are both in the  Villa Matthei  One sees on 'em the Fashion of the old Sock and  Larva  the latter of which answers the Description that is given of it by this learned Lady tho' I question not but several others were in use for I have seen the Figure of  Thalia  the Comic Muse sometimes with an entire Headpiece in her Hand sometimes with about half the Head and a little Friz like a Tower running round the Edges of the Face and sometimes with a Mask for the Face only like those  of a Modern Make Some of the  Italian  Actors wear at present these Masks for the whole Head I remember formerly I could have no Notion of that Fable in  Phaedrus  before I had seen the Figures of these entire Headpieces  Personam Tragicam fortè vulpes viderat  O Quanta Species inquit cerebrum non habet  L Fab  As wily  Renard  walk'd the Streets at Night  On a Tragedian's Mask he chanc'd to light  Turning it o'er he mutter'd with Disdain  How vast a Head is here without a Brain  I find Madam  Dacier  has taken notice of this Passage in  Phaedrus  upon the same Occasion but not of the following one in  Martial  which alludes to the same kind of Masks  Non omnes fallis scit te Proserpina canum  Personam capiti detrahet illa tuo  L Ep  Why should'st thou try to hide thy self in Youth  Impartial  Proserpine  beholds the Truth  And laughing at so fond and vain a Task  Will strip thy hoary Noddle of its Mask  In the  Villa Borghese  is the Bust of a young  Nero  which shows us the Form of an ancient  Bulla  on the Breast which is neither like a Heart as  Macrobius  describes it nor altogether resembles that in Cardinal  Chigi  's Cabinet so that without establishing a particular Instance into a general Rule we ought in Subjects of this Nature to leave room for the Humour of the Artist or Wearer There are many Figures of Gladiators at  Rome  tho' I don't remember to have seen any of the  Retiarius  the  Samnite  or the Antagonist to the  Pinnirapus  But what I could not find among the Statues I met with in Two Antique Pieces of Mosaic which are in the Possession of a Cardinal The  Retiarius  is engag'd with the  Samnite  and has had so lucky a Throw that his Net covers the whole Body of his Adversary from Head to Foot yet his Antagonist recover'd himself out of the Toiles and was Conqueror  according to the Inscription In another Piece is represented the Combat of the  Pinnirapus  who is arm'd like the  Samnite  and not like the  Retiarius  as some learned Men have supposed On the Helmet of his Antagonist are seen the Two  Pinnae  that stand up on either Side like the Wings in the  Petasus  of a  Mercury  but rise much higher and are more pointed  There is no part of the  Roman  Antiquities that we are better acquainted with than what relates to their Sacrifices For as the Old  Romans  were very much devoted to their Religion we see several Parts of it entering their ancient  Basso Relievo's  Statues and Medals not to mention their Altars Tombs Monuments and those particular Ornaments of Architecture which were borrow'd from it An Heathen Ritual could not instruct a Man better than these several Pieces of Antiquity in the particular Ceremonies and Punctilio's that attended the different kinds of Sacrifices Yet there is a much greater Variety in the Make of the Sacrificing Instruments than one finds in those who have Treated of them or have given us their Pictures For not to insist too long on such a Subject I saw in Signior  Antonio  Politi  's Collection a  Patera  without any rising in the middle as it is genenerally Engraven and another with a Handle to it as  Macrobius  describes it tho' it is quite contrary to any that I have ever seen cut in Marble and I have observed perhaps several Hundreds I might here enlarge on the Shape of the Triumphal Chariot which is different in some Pieces of Sculpture from what it appears in others and on the Figure of the  Discus  that is to be seen in the Hand of the celebrated  Castor  at Don  Livio  's which is perfectly round and not oblong as some Antiquaries have represented it nor has it any thing like a Sling fasten'd to it to add force to the Toss  Protinus imprudens actusque cupidine lusus  Tollere Taenarides  orbem  properabat  De Hyacinthi disco  Ov Met L  Th' unwary Youth impatient for the Cast  Went to snatch up the rolling Orb in haste  Notwithstanding there are so great a Multitude of cloath'd Statues at  Rome    I could never discover the several different  Roman  Garments for 'tis very difficult to Trace out the Figure of a Vest thro' all the Plaits and Foldings of the Drapery besides that the  Roman  Garments did not differ from each other so much by the Shape as by the Embroidery and Colour the one of which was too nice for the Statuary's Observation as the other does not lye within the Expression of the Chissel I observed in abundance of  Bas Reliefs  that the  Cinctus Gabinus  is nothing else but a long Garment not unlike a Surplice which would have trail'd on the Ground had it hung loose and was therefore gather'd about the middle with a Girdle After this it is worth while to read the laborious Description that  Ferrarius  has made of it  Cinctus Gabinus non aliud fuit quàm cum togae lacinia laevo brachio subducta in tergum ita rejiciebatur ut contracta retraheretur ad pectus atque ita in nodum necteretur qui nodus sive cinctus togam contrahebat brevioremque et strictiorem reddidit  De re Vestiar L C  Lipsius  's Description of the  Samnite  Armour seems drawn out of the very Words of  Livy  yet not long ago a Statue which was dug up at  Rome  dress'd in this kind of Armour gives a  much different Explication of  Livy  from what  Lipsius  has done This Figure was superscrib'd  BA TO NI  from whence  Fabretti  concludes that it was a Monument erected to the Gladiator  Bato  who after having succeeded in Two Combats was kill'd in the Third and honourably Interr'd by Order of the Emperor  Caracalla  The manner of Punctuation after each Sillable is to be met with in other Antique Inscriptions I confess I could never learn where this Figure is now to be seen but I think it may serve as an Instance of the great Uncertainty of this Science of Antiquities  Vid Fabr de Columnâ Trajani  In a Palace of Prince  Cesarini  I saw Busts of all the  Antonine  Family which were dug up about Two Years since not far from  Albano  in a Place where is suppos'd to have stood a  Villa  of  Marcus Aurelius  There are the Heads of  Antoninus Pius  the  Faustina's    Marcus Aurelius    Lucius Verus  a young  Commodus  and  Annius Verus  all incomparably well cut  Tho' the Statues that have been found among the Ruins of Old  Rome  are already very numerous there is no question but Posterity will have the Pleasure  of seeing many noble Pieces of Sculpture which are still undiscovered for doubtless there are greater Treasures of this Nature under Ground than what are yet brought to Light They have often dug into Lands that are describ'd in old Authors as the Places where such particular Statues or Obelisks stood and have seldom fail'd of Success in their Pursuits There are still many such promising Spots of Ground that have never been searched into A great part of the  Palatine  Mountain for Example lyes untouch'd which was formerly the Seat of the Imperial Palace and may be presum'd to abound with more Treasures of this Nature than any other Part of  Rome  Ecce Palatino crevit reverentia monti  Exultatque habitante Deo potioraque Delphis  Supplicibus latè populis oracula pandit  Non alium certè decuit rectoribus orbis  Esse Larem nulloque magis se colle potestas  Aestimat et summi sentit fastigia juris  Attollens apicem subjectis regia rostris  Tot circum delubra videt tantisque Deorum  Cingitur excubiis

either Hand  And on the Borders of the Palace stand  While o'er the rest her Head she proudly rears  And lodg'd amidst her Guardian Gods appears  But whether it be that the richest of these Discoveries fall into the Pope's Hands or for some other Reason it is said that the Prince  Farnese  who is the present Owner of this Seat will keep it from being turn'd up 'till he sees one of his own Family in the Chair There are Undertakers in  Rome  who often purchase the digging of Fields Gardens  or Vineyards where they find any likelihood of succeeding and some have been known to arrive at great Estates by it They pay according to the Dimensions of the Surface they are to break up and after having made Essays into it as they do for Coal in  England  they rake into the most promising Parts of it tho' they often find to their Disappointment that others have been beforehand with 'em However they generally gain enough by the Rubbish and Bricks which the present Architects value much beyond those of a Modern Make to defray the Charges of their Search I was shown Two Spaces of Ground where part of  Nero  's Golden House stood for which the Owner has been offer'd an extraordinary Sum of Mony What encourag'd the Undertakers are several very ancient Trees which grow upon the Spot from whence they conclude that these particular Tracts of Ground must have lain untouch'd for some Ages 'Tis pity there is not something like a publick Register to preserve the Memory of such Statues as have been found from time to time and to mark the particular Places where they have been taken up which would not only prevent many fruitless Searches for the  future but might often give a considerarable Light into the Quality of the Place or the Design of the Statue  But the great Magazine for all kinds of Treasure is supposed to be the Bed of the  Tiber  We may be sure when the  Romans  lay under the Apprehensions of seeing their City sack'd by a barbarous Enemy as they have done more than once that they would take care to bestow such of their Riches this way as could best bear the Water besides what the Insolence of a Brutish Conqueror may be supposed to have contributed who had an Ambition to waste and destroy all the Beauties of so celebrated a City I need not mention the old Commonshore of  Rome  which ran from all Parts of the Town with the Current and Violence of an ordinary River nor the frequent Inundations of the  Tiber  which may have swept away many of the Ornaments of its Banks nor the several Statues that the  Romans  themselves flung into it when they would revenge themselves on the Memory of an ill Citizen a dead Tyrant or a Discarded Favourite At  Rome  they have so general an Opinion of the Riches of this River that the  Jews  have formerly proffer'd the Pope to cleanse it so they might have for  their Pains what they found in the Bosome of it I have seen the Valley near  Ponte molle  which they propos'd to fashion into a new Channel for it 'till they had clear'd the old for its Reception The Pope however would not comply with the Proposal as fearing the Heats might advance too far before they had finished their Work and produce a Pestilence among his People tho' I don't see why such a Design might not be executed now with as little Danger as in  Augustus  's Time were there as many Hands employ'd upon it The City of  Rome  would receive a great Advantage from the Undertaking as it would raise the Banks and deepen the Bed of the  Tiber  and by Consequence free 'em from those frequent Inundations to which they are so subject at present for the Channel of the River is observed to be narrower within the Walls than either below or above them  Before I quit this Subject of the Statues I think it very observable that among those which are already found there should be so many not only of the same Persons but made after the same Design One would not indeed wonder to see several Figures of particular Deities and Emperors who had a Multitude of Temples  erected to 'em and had their several Sets of Worshippers and Admirers Thus  Ceres  the most beneficent and useful of the Heathen Divinities has more Statues than any other of the Gods or Goddesses as several of the  Roman  Emperesses took a Pleasure to be represented in her Dress And I believe one finds as many Figures of that excellent Emperor  Marcus Aurelius  as of all the rest together because the  Romans  had so great a Veneration for his Memory that it grew into a part of their Religion to preserve a Statue of him in almost every private Family But how comes it to pass that so many of these Statues are cut after the very same Model and not only of these but of such as had no Relation either to the Interest or Devotion of the Owner as the dying  Cleopatra  the  Narcissus  the Faune leaning against the Trunk of a Tree the Boy with the Bird in his Hand the  Leda  and her Swan with many others of the same Nature I must confess I always look upon Figures of this kind as the Copies of some celebrated Masterpiece and question not but they were famous Originals that gave Rise to the several Statues which we see with the same Air Posture and Attitudes What confirms  me in this Conjecture there are many ancient Statues of the  Venus de Medicis  the  Silenus  with the young  Bacchus  in his Arms the  Hercules Farnese  the  Antinöus  and other beautiful Originals of the Ancients that are already drawn out of the Rubbish where they lay conceal'd for so many Ages Among the rest I have observed more that are form'd after the Design of the  Venus  of  Medicis  than of any other from whence I believe one may conclude that it was the most celebrated Statue among the Ancients as well as among the Moderns It has always been usual for Sculptors to work upon the best Models as it is for those that are Curious to have Copies of them  I am apt to think something of the same Account may be given of the Resemblance that we meet with in many of the Antique  Basso Relievo's  I remember I was very well pleased with the Device of one that I met with on the Tomb of a young  Roman  Lady which had beem made for her by her Mother The Sculptor had chosen the Rape of  Proserpine  for his Device where in one End you might see the God of the Dead  Pluto  hurrying away a beautiful young Virgin  Proserpine  and at the other the Grief and Distraction of  the Mother  Ceres  on that Occasion I have since observed the same Device upon several  Sarcophagi  that have enclos'd the Ashes of Men or Boys Maids or Matrons for when the Thought took tho' at first it received its Rise from such a particular Occasion as I have mention'd the Ignorance of the Sculptors apply'd it promiscuously I know there are Authors who discover a Mystery in this Device  A Man is sometimes surprized to find so many extravagant Fancies as are cut on the old Pagan Tombs Masks Huntingmatches and Bacchanals are very common sometimes one meets with a lewd Figure of a  Priapus  and in the  Villa Pamphilia  is seen a Satyr coupling with a Goat There are however many of a more serious Nature that shadow out the Existence of the Soul after Death and the Hopes of a happy Immortality I cannot leave the  Basso Relievo's  without mentioning one of 'em where the Thought is extreamly noble It is call'd  Homer  's  Apotheosis  and consists of a Groupe of Figures cut in the same Block of Marble and rising one above another by Four or Five different Ascents  Jupiter  sits at the Top of it with a Thunderbolt in his Hand and  in such a Majesty as  Homer  himself represents him presides over the Ceremony  Immediately beneath him are the Figures of the Nine Muses suppos'd to be celebrating the Praises of the Poet  Homer  himself is placed at one End of the lowest Row sitting in a Chair of State which is supported on each Side by the Figure of a kneeling Woman The one holds a Sword in her Hand to represent the  Iliad  or Actions of  Achilles  as the other has an  Aplustre  to represent the  Odyssy  or Voyage of  Ulysses  About the Poet's Feet are creeping a Couple of Mice as an Emblem of the  Batrachomyomachia  Behind the Chair stands Time and the Genius of the Earth distinguish'd by their proper Attributes and putting a Garland on the Poet's Head to intimate the mighty Reputation he has gain'd in all Ages and in all Nations of the World Before him stands an Altar with a Bull ready to be Sacrific'd to the new God and behind the Victim a Train of the several Vertues that are represented in  Homer  's  Works or to be learnt out of them lifting up their Hands in Admiration of the Poet and in Applause of the Solemnity This Antique Piece of Sculpture is in the Possession of the Constable  Colonna  but never shown to those who see the Palace unless they particularly desire it  Among the great Variety of ancient Coins which I saw at  Rome  I could not but take particular notice of such as relate to any of the Buildings or Statues that are still Extant Those of the First kind have been already published by the Writers of the  Roman  Antiquities and may be most of them met with in the last Edition of  Donatus  as the Pillars of  Trajan  and  Antonine  the Arches of  Drusus Germanicus  and  Septimius Severus  the Temples of  Janus    Concord    Vesta    Jupiter tonans    Apollo  and  Faustina  the  Circus Maximus    Agonalis  and that of  Caracalla  or according to  Fabretti  of  Galienus  of  Vespasian  's Amphitheater and  Alexander Severus  's Baths tho' I must confess the Subject of the last may be very well doubted of As for the  Meta sudans  and  Pons Aelius  which have gain'd a Place among the Buildings that are now standing and to be met with on old Reverses of Medals The Coin that  shows the first is generally rejected as spurious nor is the other tho' cited in the last Edition of Monsieur  Vaillant  esteem'd more Authentick by the present  Roman  Medallists who are certainly the most skilful in the World as to the Mechanical Part of this Science I shall close up this Set of Medals with a very Curious one as large as a Medalion that is singular in its kind On one Side is the Head of the Emperor  Trajan  the Reverse has on it the  Circus Maximus  and a View of the Side of the  Palatine  Mountain that faces it on which are seen several Edifices and among the rest the famous Temple of  Apollo  that has still a considerable Ruin standing This Medal I saw in the Hands of Monseigneur  Strozzi  Brother to the Duke of that Name who has many Curiosities in his Possession and is very obliging to a Stranger who desires the Sight of 'em It is a surprising thing that among the great Pieces of Architecture represented on the old Coins one can never meet with the  Pantheon  the  Mausolaeum  of  Augustus    Nero  's Golden House the  Moles Adriani  the  Septizonium  of  Severus  the Baths of  Dioclesian  c But since it was the Custom of the  Roman  Emperors thus to Register their most  remarkable Buildings as well as Actions and since there are several in either of these kinds not to be found on Medals more extraordinary than those that are we may I think with great Reason suspect our Collections of old Coins to be extremely deficient and that those which are already found out scarce bear a Proportion to what are yet undiscover'd A Man takes a great deal more Pleasure in surveying the ancient Statues who compares them with Medals than it is possible for him to do without some little Knowledge this way for these Two Arts illustrate each other and as there are several Particulars in History and Antiquities which receive a great Light from ancient Coins so would it be impossible to Decipher the Faces of the many Statues that are to be seen at  Rome  without so Universal a Key to them It is this that teaches to distinguish the Kings and Consuls Emperors and Emperesses the Deities and Virtues with a Thousand other Particulars relating to Statuary and not to be learnt by any other Means In the  Villa Pamphilia  stands the Statue of a Man in Woman's Cloaths which the Antiquaries do not know what to make of and therefore pass it off for an  Hermaphrodite    But a learned Medallist in  Rome  has lately fix'd it to  Clodius  who is so famous for having intruded into the S  emnities of the  Bona Dea  in a Woman's Habit for one sees the same Features and Make of Face in a Medal of the  Clodian  Family  I have seen on Coins the Four finest Figures perhaps that are now Extant The  Hercules Farnese  the  Venus  of  Medicis  the  Apollo  in the  Belvidere  and the famous  Marcus Aurelius  on Horseback The oldest Medal that the First appears upon is one of  Commodus  the Second on one of  Faustina  the Third on one of  Antoninus Pius  and the last on one of  Lucius Verus  We may conclude I think from hence that these Statues were extremely celebrated among the old  Romans  or they would never have been honoured with a Place among the Emperor's Coins We may further observe that all Four of 'em make their first Appearance in the  Antonine  Family for which Reason I am apt to think they are all of them the Product of that Age They would probably have been mentioned by  Pliny  the Naturalist who liv'd in the next Reign save one before  Antoninus Pius  had they been made in his Time As for the  Brazen Figure of  Marcus Aurelius  on Horseback there is no doubt of its being of this Age tho' I must confess it may be doubted whether the Medal I have cited represents it All I can say for it is that the Horse and Man on the Medal are in the same Posture as they are on the Statue and that there is a Resemblance of  Marcus Aurelius  's Face for I have seen this Reverse on a Medalion of  Don Livio  's Cabinet and much more distinctly in another very beautiful one that is in the Hands of Signior  Marc Antonio  It is generally objected that  Lucius Verus  would rather have placed the Figure of himself on Horseback upon the Reverse of his own Coin than the Figure of  Marcus Aurelius  But it is very well known that an Emperor often stamp'd on his Coins the Face or Ornaments of his Collegue as an Instance of his Respect or Friendship for him and we may suppose  Lucius Verus  would omit no Opportunity of doing Honour to  Marcus Aurelius  whom he rather revered as his Father than treated as his Partner in the Empire The Famous  Antinous  in the  Belvidere  must have been made too about this Age for he dyed towards the middle of  Adrian  's Reign the immediate Predecessor of  Antoninus Pius  This entire Figure tho' not to be found in Medals may be seen in several precious Stones Monsieur  La Chausse  the Author of the  Musaeum Romanum  show'd me an  Antinous  that he has published in his last Volume cut in a  Cornelian  which he values at Fifty Pistoles It represents him in the Habit of a  Mercury  and is the finest  Intaglia  that I ever saw  Next to the Statues there is nothing in  Rome  more surprising than that amazing variety of ancient Pillars of so many kinds of Marble As most of the old Statues may be well supposed to have been cheaper to their first Owners than they are to a Modern Purchaser several of the Pillars are certainly rated at a much lower Price at present than they were of old For not to mention what a huge Column of  Granite    Serpentine  or  Porphyry  must have cost in the Quarry or in its Carriage from  Egypt  to  Rome  we may only consider the great Difficulty of hewing it into any Form and of giving it the due Turn Proportion and Polish It is well known how these sorts of Marble resist the Impressions of such Instruments as are now in use There is indeed a  Milanese  at  Rome  who works in them but his Advances  are so very slow that he scarce lives upon what he gains by it He show'd me a Piece of  Porphyry  work'd into an ordinary Salver which had cost him Four Months continual Application before he could bring it into that Form The Ancients had probably some Secret to harden the Edges of their Tools without recurring to those Extravagant Opinions of their having an Art to mollifie the Stone or that it was naturally softer at its first cutting from the Rock or what is still more absurd that it was an artificial Composition and not the natural Product of Mines and Quarries The most valuable Pillars about  Rome  for the Marble of which they are made are the Four Columns of Oriental Jasper in St  Paulina  's Chappel at St  Maria Maggiore  Two of Oriental Granite in St  Pudenziana  One of Transparent Oriental Jasper in the  Vatican  Library Four of  NeroBianco  in St  Cecilia Transtevere  Two of  Brocatello  and Two of Oriental Agate in Don  Livio  's Palace Two of  Giallo Antico  in St  John Lateran  and Two of  Verdi Antique  in the  Villa Pamphilia  These are all entire and solid Pillars and made of such kinds of Marble as are no where to be found but among Antiquities whether  it be that the Veins of it are undiscovered or that they were quite exhausted upon the ancient Buildings Among these old Pillars I cannot forbear reckoning a great Part of an Alablaster Column which was found in the Ruins of  Livia  's  Portico  It is of the Colour of Fire and may be seen over the high Altar of St  Maria  in  Campitello  for they have cut it into Two Pieces and fix'd it in the Shape of a Cross in a Hole of the Wall that was made on purpose to receive it so that the Light passing thro' it from without makes it look to those who are in the Church like a huge transparent Cross of Amber As for the Workmanship of the old  Roman  Pillars Monsieur  Desgodetz  in his accurate Measures of these Ruins has observed that the Ancients have not kept to the nicety of Proportion and the Rules of Art so much as the Moderns in this Particular Some to excuse this Defect lay the Blame of it on the Workmen of  Aegypt  and of other Nations who sent most of the ancient Pillars ready shap'd to  Rome  Others say that the Ancients knowing Architecture was chiefly design'd to please the Eye only took care to avoid such Disproportions as were gross enough to be observ'd by the  Sight without minding whether or no they approach'd to a Mathematical Exactness Others will have it rather to be an Effect of Art and of what the  Italians  call the  Gusto grande  than of any Negligence in the Architect for they say the Ancients always consider'd the Situation of a Building whether it were high or low in an open Square or in a narrow Street and more or less deviated from their Rules of Art to comply with the several Distances and Elevations from which their Works were to be regarded It is said there is an  Ionic  Pillar in the  Santa Maria Transtevere  where the Marks of the Compass are still to be seen on the Volute and that  Palladio  learnt from hence the working of that difficult Problem but I never could find time to examine all the old Columns of that Church Among the Pillars I must not pass over the Two noblest in the World those of  Trajan  and  Antonine  There could not have been a more magnificent Design than that of  Trajan  's Pillar Where could an Emperor's Ashes have been so nobly lodg'd as in the midst of his Metropolis and on the Top of so exalted a Monument with the greatest of his Actions underneath him Or as some will have it  his Statue was on the Top his Urn at the Foundation and his Battles in the midst The Sculpture of it is too well known to be here mention'd The most remarkable Piece in  Antonine  's Pillar is the Figure of  Jupiter Pluvius  sending down Rain on the fainting Army of  Marcus Aurelius  and Thunderbolts on his Enemies which is the greatest Confirmation possible of the Story of the Christian Legion and will be a standing Evidence for it when any Passage in an old Author may be supposed to be forged The Figure that  Jupiter  here makes among the Clouds puts me in Mind of a Passage in the  Aeneid  which gives just such another Image of him  Virgil  's Interpreters are certainly to blame that suppose it is nothing but the Air which is here meant by  Jupiter  Quantus ab occasu veniens pluvialibus haedis  Verberat imber humum quàm multâ grandine nimbi  In vada praecipitant quum Jupiter horridas austris  Torqu  t aquosam hyemem caelo cava nubila rumpit  Aen  The Combat thickens like the Storm that flies  From Westward when the show'ry Kids arise  Or patt'ring Hail comes pouring on the Main  When  Jupiter  descends in harden'd Rain  Or bellowing Clouds burst with a stormy Sound  And with an armed Winter strew the Ground  Dryden  I have seen a Medal that according to the Opinion of many learned Men relates to the same Story The Emperor is entitled on it  Germanicus  as it was in the Wars of  Germany  that this Circumstance happened and carries on the Reverse a Thunderbolt in his Hand for the Heathens attributed the same Miracle to the Piety of the Emperor that the Christians ascribed to the Prayers of their Legion  Fulmen de coelo precibus suis contra hostium Machinamentum Marcus extorsit suis pluviâ impetratâ cùm siti laborarent  Jul Capit  Claudian  takes notice of this Miracle and has given the same Reason for it  Ad templa vocatus  Clemens Marce redis cum gentibus undique cinctam  Exuit Hesperiam paribus fortuna periclis  Laus ibi nulla ducum nam flammeus imber in hostem  Decidit hunc dorso trepidum fumante ferebat  Ambustus sonipes hic tabescente solutus  Subsedit galeâ liquefactaque fulgurecuspis  Canduit et subitis fluxere vaporibus enses  Tunc contenta polo mortalis nescia teli  Pugna fuit Chaldaea mago seu carmina ritu  Armavere Deos seu quod reor omne tonantis  Obsequium Marci mores potuere mereri  De Sexto Cons Hon  So mild  Aurelius  to the Gods repaid  The grateful Vows that in his Fears he made  When  Latium  from unnumber'd Foes was freed  Nor did he Then by his own Force succeed  But with descending Show'rs of Brimstone fir'd  The wild Barbarian in the Storm expir'd  Wrapt in devouring Flames the Horseman rag'd  And spurr'd the Steed in equal Flames engag'd  Another pent in his scorch'd Armour glow'd  While from his Head the melting Helmet flow'd  Swords by the Light'ning's subtile Force distill'd  And the cold Sheath with running Metal fill'd  No Human Arm its weak Assistance brought  But Heav'n offended Heav'n the Battel fought  Whether dark Magick and  Chaldean  Charms  Had fill'd the Skies and set the Gods in Arms  Or good  Aurelius  as I more believe  Deserv'd whatever Aid the Thunderer could give  I do not remember that M  Dacier  among several Quotations on this Subject in the Life of  Marcus Aurelius  has taken Notice either of the forementioned Figure on the Pillar of  Marcus Antoninus  or of the Beautiful Passage I have quoted out of  Claudian  It is pity the Obelisks in  Rome  had not been charged with several Parts of the  Egyptian  Histories instead of Hierogliphics which might have given no small Light to the Antiquities of that Nation which are now quite sunk out of sight in those remoter Ages of the World Among the Triumphal Arches that of  Constantine  is not only the noblest of any in  Rome  but in the World I search'd narrowly into it especially among those Additions of Sculpture made in the Emperor's own Age to see if I could find any Marks of the Apparition that is said to have preceded the very Victory which gave Occasion to the Triumphal Arch But there are not the least Traces of it to be met with which is not very strange if we consider that the greatest Part of the Ornaments were taken from  Trajan  's Arch and set up to the new Conqueror in no small haste by the Senate and People of  Rome  who were then most of them Heathens There is however something in the Inscription which is as old as the Arch it self that seems to hint at the Emperor's Vision  Imp Caes Fl Constantino maximo P F Augusto S P Q R quod  instinctu Divinitatis  mentis magnitudine cum exercitu suo tam de Tyranno  quàm de omni ejus Factione uno tempore justis Rempublicam ultus est armis arcum triumphis insignem dicavit  There is no Statue of this Emperor at  Rome  with a Cross to it tho' the Ecclesiastical Historians say there were many such erected to him I have seen of his Medals that were stamp'd with it and a very remarkable one of his Son  Constantius  where he is Crown'd by a Victory on the Reverse with this Inscription  In hoc Signo Victor eris  ☧ This Triumphal Arch and some other Buildings of the same Age show us that Architecture held up its Head after all the other Arts of Designing were in a very weak and languishing Condition as it was probably the first among them that revived If I was surprized not to find the Cross in  Constantine  's Arch I was as much disappointed not to see the Figure of the Temple of  Jerusalem  on that of  Titus  where are represented the Golden Candlestick the Table of Shewbread and the River  Jordan  Some are of Opinion that the composite Pillars of this Arch were made in Imitation of the Pillars of  Solomon  's Temple and observe that these are the most ancient of any that are found of that Order  It is almost impossible for a Man to form in his Imagination such beautiful and glorious Scenes as are to be met with in several of the  Roman  Churches and Chappels for having such a prodigious Stock of ancient Marble within the very City and at the same time so many different Quarries in the Bowels of their Country most of their Chappels are laid over with such a rich Variety of Incrustations as cannot possibly be found in any other Part of the World And notwithstanding the incredible Sums of Mony which have been already laid out this way there is still the same Work going forward in other Parts of  Rome  the last still endeavouring to outshine those that went before them Painting Sculpture and Architecture are at present far from being in a flourishing Condition but 'tis thought they may all recover themselves under the present Pontificate if the Wars and Confusions of  Italy  will give them leave For as the Pope is himself a Master of polite Learning and a great Encourager of Arts so at  Rome  any of these Arts immediately thrives under the Encouragement of the Prince and may be fetched up to its Perfection in Ten or a Dozen Years which is the Work of an  Age or Two in other Countries where they have not such excellent Models to form themselves upon  I shall conclude my Observations on  Rome  with a Letter of King  Henry  the Eighth to  Ann  of  Bulleyn  transcribed out of the famous Manuscript in the Vatican which the Bishop of  Salisbury  assures us is written with the King's own Hand  The Cause of my Writing at this Time is to hear of your Health and Prosperity of which I would be as glad as in manner of my own praying God that it be his Pleasure to send us shortly together for I promise I long for it howbeit I trust it shall not be long too and seeing my Darling is absent I can no less do than send her some Flesh Prognosticating that hereafter thou must have some of mine which if he please I would have now As touching your Sister's Mother I have consign'd  Walter Welsh  to write to my Lord  Manwring  my Mind therein whereby I trust he shall not have Power to disseid her for surely whatever is said it cannot so stand with his Honour but that he must needs take his natural Daughter in her extreme  Necessity No more to you at this time my own Darling but that with a Whistle I wish we were together one Evening by the Hand of Yours  HENRY  These Letters are always shown to an  Englishman  that visits the  Vatican  Library  TOWNS Within the Neighbourhood of ROME  _I Spent Three or Four Days on  Tivoli    Frescati    Palestrina  and  Albano  In our way to  Tivoli  I saw the Rivulet of  Solforata  formerly call'd  Albula  and smelt the Stench that arises from its Waters some time before I saw them  Martial  mentions this offensive Smell in an Epigram of the Fourth Book as he does the Rivulet it self in the First  Quod siccae redolet lacus lacunae  Crudarum nebulae quod Albularum  L Ep  The drying Marshes such a Stench convey  Such the rank Steams of reeking  Albula  Itur ad Herculeae gelidas quà Tiburis arces  Canaque sulphureis Albula fumat aquis  L Ep  As from high  Rome  to  Tivoli  you go  Where  Albula  's sulphureous Waters flow  The little Lake that gives Rise to this River with its floating Islands is one of the most extraordinary natural Curiosities about  Rome  It lyes in the very Flat of  Campania  and as it is the Drain of these Parts 'tis no Wonder that it is so impregnated with Sulphur It has at Bottom so thick a Sediment of it that upon throwing in a Stone the Water boils for a considerable time over the Place which has been stirr'd up At the same time are seen little Flakes of Scurfe rising up that are probably the Parts which compose the Islands for they often mount of themselves tho' the Water is not troubled  I question not but this Lake was formerly much larger than it is at present and that the Banks have grown over it by degrees in the same manner as the Islands have been form'd on it Nor is it improbable but that in Process of  Time the whole Surface of it may be crusted over as the Islands enlarge themselves and the Banks close in upon them All about the Lake where the Ground is dry we found it to be hollow by the Trampling of our Horses Feet I could not discover the least Traces of the  Sibyls  Temple and Grove which stood on the Borders of this Lake  Tivoli  is seen at a distance lying along the Brow of a Hill Its Situation has given  Horace  occasion to call it  Tibur Supinum  as  Virgil  perhaps for the same Reason entitles it  Superbum  The  Villa de Medicis  with its WaterWorks the Cascade of the  Teverone  and the Ruins of the  Sibyls  Temple of which  Vignola  has made a little Copy at  Peters de Montorio  are described in every Itinerary I must confess I was most pleased with a beautiful Prospect that none of them have mentioned which lyes at about a Mile distance from the Town It opens on one Side into the  Roman Campania  where the Eye loses it self on a smooth spacious Plain On the other Side is a more broken and interrupted Scene made up of an infinite Variety of Inequalities and Shadowings that naturally arise from an agreeable Mixture of Hills Groves and Vallies But the most enlivening Part  of all is the River  Teverone  which you see at about a Quarter of a Mile's distance throwing it self down a Precipice and falling by several Cascades from one Rock to another 'till it gains the Bottom of the Valley where the Sight of it would be quite lost did not it sometimes discover it self thro' the Breaks and Openings of the Woods that grow about it The  Roman  Painters often work upon this Landskip and I am apt to believe that  Horace  had his Eye upon it in those Two or Three beautiful Touches which he has given us of these Seats The  Teverone  was formerly call'd the  Anio  Me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon  Nec tam Larissae percussit campus opimae  Quàm domus Albuneae resonantis  Et praeceps Anio et Tiburni lacus et uda  Mobilibus pomaria rivis  L O  Not fair  Larissa  's fruitful Shore  Nor  Lacedaemon  charms me more  Than high  Albunea  's airy Walls  Resounding with her Waterfalls  And  Tivoli  's delightful Shades  And  Anio  rolling in Caseades  That through the flow'ry Meadows glides  And all the beauteous Scene divides  I remember Monsieur  Dacier  explains  Mobilibus  by  Ductilibus  and believes that the Word relates to the Conduits Pipes and Canals that were made to distribute the Waters up and down according to the Pleasure of the Owner But any one who sees the  Teverone  must be of another Opinion and conclude it to be one of the most  moveable  Rivers in the World that has its Stream broken by such a Multitude of Cascades and is so often shifted out of one Channel into another After a very turbulent and noisie Course of several Miles among the Rocks and Mountains the  Teverone  falls into the Valley beforementioned where it recovers its Temper as it were by little and little and after many Turns and Windings glides peaceably into the  Tiber  In which Sense we are to understand  Silius Italicus  's Description to give it its proper Beauty  Sulphureis gelidus quà serpit leniter undis  Ad genitorem Anio labens sine murmure Tibrim  Here the loud  Anio  's boist'rous Clamours cease  That with submissive Murmurs glides in Peace  To his old Sire the  Tiber    At  Frescati  I had the Satisfaction of seeing the First Sketch of  Versailles  in the Walks and WaterWorks The Prospect from it was doubtless much more delightful formerly when the  Campania  was set thick with Towns Villas and Plantations  Cicero  's  Tusculum  was at a Place call'd  Grotto Ferrate  about Two Miles off this Town tho' most of the Modern Writers have fix'd it to  Frescati Nardini  says there was found among the Ruins at  Grotto Ferrate  a Piece of Sculpture which  Cicero  himself mentions in one of his familiar Epistles In going to  Frescati  we had a fair View of Mount  Algido  On our Way to  Palaestrina  we saw the Lake  Regillus  famous for the Apparition of  Castor  and  Pollux  who were here seen to give their Horses Drink after the Battel between the  Romans  and the SoninLaw of  Tarquin  At some distance from it we had a View of the  Lacus Gabinus  that is much larger than  the former We left the Road for about half a Mile to see the Sources of a Modern Aqueduct It is entertaining to observe how the several little Springs and Rills that break out of the Sides of the Mountain are glean'd up and conveyed thro' little covered Channels into the main Hollow of the Aqueduct It was certainly very lucky for  Rome  seeing it had occasion for so many Aqueducts that there chanced to be such a Range of Mountains within its Neighbourhood For by this means they could take up their Water from what height they pleased without the Expence of such an Engine as that of  Marli  Thus the  Claudian  Aqueduct ran Thirty Eight Miles and sunk after the Proportion of Five Foot and a half every Mile by the Advantage only of a high Source and the low Situation of  Rome Palaestrina  stands very high like most other Towns in  Italy  for the Advantage of the cool Breezes for which Reason  Virgil  calls it  Altum  and  Horace    Frigidum Praeneste    Statius  calls it  Praeneste Sacrum  because of the Famous Temple of Fortune that stood in it There are still great Pillars of Granite and other Fragments of this ancient Temple But the most considerable Remnant of it is  a very beautiful  Mosaic  Pavement the finest I have ever seen in Marble The Parts are so well join'd together that the whole Piece looks like a continued Picture There are in it the Figures of a Rhinoceros of Elephants and of several other Animals with little Landskips which look very lively and well painted tho' they are made out of the natural Colours and Shadows of the Marble I do not remember ever to have met with any old  Roman Mosaic  composed of little Pieces of Clay half vitrify'd and prepared at the GlassHouses which the  Italians  call  Smalte  These are much in use at present and may be made of what Colour and Figure the Workman pleases which is a Modern Improvement of the Art and enables those who are employ'd in it to make much finer Pieces of  Mosaic  than they did formerly  In our Excursion to  Albano  we went as far as  Nemi  that takes its Name from the  Nemus Dianae  The whole Country thereabouts is still overrun with Woods and Thickets The Lake of  Nemi  lyes in a very deep Bottom so surrounded on all Sides with Mountains and Groves that the Surface of it is never ruffled with the least Breath of  Wind which perhaps together with the Clearness of its Waters gave it formerly the Name of  Diana  's LookingGlass  Speculumque Dianae  Virg  Prince  Caesarini  has a Palace at  Jensano  very near  Nemi  in a pleasant Situation and set off with many beautiful Walks In our Return from  Jensano  to  Albano  we passed through  la Ricca  the  Aricia  of the Ancients  Horace  's First Stage from  Rome  to  Brundisi  There is nothing at  Albano  so remarkable as the Prospect from the  Capucin  's Garden which for the Extent and Variety of pleasing Incidents is I think the most delightful one that I ever saw It takes in the whole  Campania  and terminates in a full View of the Mediterranean You have a Sight at the same time of the  Alban  Lake which lyes just by in an Oval Figure of about Seven Miles round and by reason of the continued Circuit of high Mountains that encompass it looks like the  Area  of some vast Amphitheater This together with the several green Hills and naked Rocks within the Neighbourhood makes the most agreeable Confusion imaginable  Albano  keeps up its Credit still for Wine which perhaps would be as good as it was anciently did they preserve it to as great an Age but as for Olives there are now very few here tho' they are in great plenty at  Tivoli  Albani pretiosa senectus  Juv Sat  Cras bibet Albanis aliquid de montibus aut de  Setinis cujus patriam titulumque

end of  October  in my Way to  Sienna  I lay the first Night at a little Village in the Territories of the ancient  Veii  Haec tum nomina erant nunc sunt sine nomine Campi  The Ruins of their Capital City are at present so far lost that the Geographers are not able to determine exactly the Place where they once stood So literally is that noble Prophecy of  Lucan  fulfill'd of this and other Places of  Latium  Gentes Mars iste futuras  Obruet et populos aevi venientis in orbem  Erepto natale feret tunc omne Latinum  Fabula nomen erit Gabios Veïosque Coramque  Pulvere vix tectae poterunt

betray  The Place where once the very Ruins lay  High  Alba  's Walls and the  Lavinian  Strand  A lonely Desart and an empty Land  Shall scarce afford for needful Hours of Rest  A single House to their benighted Guest  We here saw the Lake  Bacca  that gives Rise to the  Cremera  on whose Banks the  Fabii  were slain  Tercentum numerabat avos quos turbine Martis  Abstulit una Dies cùm fors non aequa labori  Patricio Cremerae maculavit sanguine ripas  Sil It L  Fabius  a num'rous Ancestry could tell  Three Hundred Heroes that in Battel fell  Near the fam'd  Cremera  's disast'rous Flood  That ran polluted with  Patrician  Blood  We saw afterwards in the Progress of our Voyage the Lakes of  Vico  and  Bolsena  The last is reckon'd One and Twenty Miles in Circuit and is plentifully stock'd with Fish and Fowl There are in it a couple of Islands that are perhaps the Two floating Isles mentioned by  Pliny  with that improbable Circumstance of their appearing sometimes like a Circle and sometimes like a Triangle but never like a Quadrangle It is easie enough to conceive how they might become fix'd tho' they once floated and it is not very credible that the Naturalist could be deceived in his Account of a Place that lay  as it were in the Neighbourhood of  Rome  At one End of this Lake stands  Montefiascone  the Habitation of  Virgil  's  Aequi Falisci  Aen and on the Side of it the Town of the  Volsinians  now call'd  Bolsena  Aut positis nemorosa inter juga Volsiniis  Juv Sat    Volsinium  stood  Cover'd with Mountains and enclos'd with Wood  I saw in the Churchyard of  Bolsena  an antique Funeral Monument of that kind which they call'd a  Sarcophagus  very entire and what is particular Engraven  on all Sides  with a curious Representation of a Bacchanal Had the Inhabitants observed a couple of lewd Figures at one End of it they would not have thought it a proper Ornament for the Place where it now stands After having travell'd hence to  Aquapendente  that stands in a wonderful pleasant Situation we came to the little Brook which separates the Pope's Dominions from the Great Duke's The Frontier Castle of  Radicofani  is seated on the highest Mountain in the Country and is as well fortify'd as the Situation of  the Place will permit We here found the natural Face of the Country quite changed from what we had been entertain'd with in the Pope's Dominions For instead of the many beautiful Scenes of green Mountains and fruitful Vallies that we had been presented with for some Days before we saw now nothing but a wild naked Prospect of Rocks and Hills worn on all Sides with Gutters and Channels and not a Tree or Shrub to be met with in a vast Circuit of several Miles This Savage Prospect put me in Mind of the  Italian  Proverb that  The Pope has the Flesh    and the Great Duke the Bones of  Italy Among a large Extent of these Barren Mountains I saw but a single Spot that was cultivated on which there stood a Convent  SIENNA LEGHORNE PISA  _SIENNA stands high and is adorn'd with a great many Towers of Brick which in the Time of the Commonwealth were erected to such of the Members as had done any considerable Service to their Country These Towers gave us a sight of the Town a great while before we enter'd it There is nothing in this City so extraordinary as the Cathedral which a Man may view with Pleasure after he has seen St  Peters  tho' 'tis quite of another Make and can only be look'd upon as one of the Masterpieces of  Gothic  Architecture When a Man sees the prodigious Pains and Expence that our ForeFathers have been at in these  barbarous Buildings one cannot but fancy to himself what Miracles of Architecture they would have left us had they only been instructed in the right way for when the Devotion of those Ages was much warmer than it is at present and the Riches of the People much more at the Disposal of the Priests there was so much Mony consumed on these  Gothic  Cathedrals as would have finish'd a greater Variety of Noble Buildings than have been raised either before or since that Time  One would wonder to see the vast Labour that has been laid out on this single Cathedral The very Spouts are loaden with Ornaments the Windows are form'd like so many Scenes of Perspective with a Multitude of little Pillars retiring one behind another the great Columns are finely engraven with Fruits and Foliage that run twisting about them from the very Top to the Bottom the whole Body of the Church is chequer'd with different Lays of White and Black Marble the Pavement curiously cut out in Designs and ScriptureStories and the Front cover'd with such a Variety of Figures and overrun with so many little Mazes and Labyrinths of Sculpture that nothing in the World  can make a prettier Show to those who prefer false Beauties and affected Ornaments to a Noble and Majestick Simplicity Overagainst this Church stands a large Hospital erected by a ShooeMaker who has been Beatify'd tho' never Sainted There stands a Figure of him superscrib'd  Sutor ultra Crepidam  I shall speak nothing of the Extent of this City the Cleanliness of its Streets nor the Beauty of its Piazza which so many Travellers have described As this is the last Republick that fell under the Subjection of the Duke of  Florence  so is it still supposed to retain many Hankerings after its ancient Liberty For this Reason when the Keys and Pageants of the Duke's Towns and Governments pass in Procession before him on St  John  Baptist's Day I was told that  Sienna  comes in the Rear of his Dominions and is push'd forward by those who follow to show the Reluctancy it has to appear in such a Solemnity I shall say nothing of the many gross and absurd Traditions of St  Catherine  of  Sienna  who is the great Saint of this Place I think there is as much Pleasure in hearing a Man tell his Dreams as in reading Accounts of this Nature A Traveller that thinks them worth his  Observation may fill a Book with them at every great Town in  Italy  From  Sienna  we went forward to  Leghorne  where the Two Ports the Bagnio and  Donatelli  's Statue of the Great Duke amidst the Four Slaves chain'd to his Pedestal are very noble Sights The Square is one of the largest and will be one of the most beautiful in  Italy  when this Statue is erected in it and a Townhouse built at one End of it to front the Church that stands at the other They are at a continual Expence to cleanse the Ports and keep 'em from being choak'd up which they do by the help of several Engines that are always at work and employ many of the Great Duke's Slaves Whatever part of the Harbour they scoop in it has an Influence on all the rest for the Sea immediately works the whole Bottom to a Level They draw a double Advantage from the Dirt that is taken up as it clears the Port and at the same time dries up several Marshes about the Town where they lay it from time to time One can scarce imagine how great Profits the Duke of  Tuscany  receives from this single Place which are not generally thought so considerable because it passes for a Free Port  But it is very well known how the Great Duke on a late occasion notwithstanding the Privileges of the Merchants drew no small Sums of Mony out of them tho' still in respect of the exorbitant Dues that are paid at most other Ports it deservedly retains the Name of Free It brings into his Dominions a great Increase of People from all other Nations They reckon in it near Ten Thousand  Jews  many of them very Rich and so great Traffickers that our  English  Factors complain they have most of our Country Trade in their Hands 'Tis true the Strangers pay little or no Taxes directly but out of every thing they buy there goes a large Gabel to the Government The very IceMerchant at  Leghorne  pays above a Thousand Pound Sterling annually for his Privilege and the TobaccoMerchant Ten Thousand The Ground is sold by the Great Duke at a very high Price and Houses are every Day rising on it All the Commodities that go up into the Country of which there are great Quantities are clogg'd with Impositions as soon as they leave  Leghorne  All the Wines Oils and Silks that come down from the fruitful  Vallies of  Pisa    Florence  and other Parts of  Tuscany  must make their Way thro' several Duties and Taxes before they can reach the Port The Canal that runs from the Sea into the  Arno  gives a convenient Carriage to all Goods that are to be shipp'd off which does not a little enrich the Owners and in proportion as private Men grow wealthy their Legacies LawSuits Daughter's the Portions  c  encrease in all which the Great Duke comes in for a considerable Share The  Lucquese  who Traffick at this Port are said to bring in a great deal into the Duke's Coffers Another Advantage which may be of great use to him is that at Five or Six Days warning he might find Credit in this Town for very large summs of Money which no other Prince in  Italy  can pretend to I need not take notice of the Reputation that this Port gives him among Foreign Princes but there is one Benefit arising from it which tho' never thrown into the Account is doubtless very considerable It is well known how the  Pisans  and  Florentines  long regretted the Loss of their ancient Liberty and their Subjection to a Family that some of them thought themselves equal to in the flourishing Times of their Commonwealths  The Town of  Leghorne  has accidentally done what the greatest Fetch of Politicks would have found difficult to have brought about for it has almost unpeopled  Pisa  if we compare it with what it was formerly and every Day lessens the Number of the Inhabitants of  Florence  This does not only weaken those Places but at the same time turns many of the busiest Spirits from their old Notions of Honour and Liberty to the Thoughts of Traffick and Merchandise And as Men engaged in a Road of Thriving are no Friends to Changes and Revolutions they are at present worn into a Habit of Subjection and push all their Pursuits another way It is no Wonder therefore that the Great Duke has such Apprehensions of the Pope's making  Civita Vecchia  a Free Port which may in time prove so very prejudicial to  Leghorne  It would be thought an improbable Story should I set down the several Methods that are commonly reported to have been made use of during the last Pontificate to put a stop to this Design The Great Duke's Mony was so well bestow'd in the Conclave that several of the Cardinals dissuaded the Pope from the Undertaking and at last  turn'd all his Thoughts upon the little Port which he made at  Antium  near  Nettuno  The chief Workmen that were to have convey'd the Water to  Civita Vecchia  were bought off and when a poor  Capucin  that was thought Proof against all Bribes had undertaken to carry on the Work he dy'd a little after he had enter'd upon it The present Pope however who is very well acquainted with the Secret History and the Weakness of his Predecessor seems resolved to bring the Project to its Perfection He has already been at vast Charges in finishing the Aqueduct and had some Hopes that if the War should drive our  English  Merchants from  Sicily  and  Naples  they would settle here His Holiness has told some  English  Gentlemen that those of our Nation should have the greatest Privileges of any but the Subjects of the Church One of our Countreymen who makes a good Figure at  Rome  told me the Pope has this Design extremely at his Heart but that he fears the  English  will suffer nothing like a Resident or Consul in his Dominions tho' at the same time he hoped the Business might as well be transacted by one that had no publick Character This Gentleman has so busied  himself in the Affair that he has offended the  French  and  Spanish  Cardinals insomuch that Cardinal  Janson  refused to see him when he would have made his Apology for what he had said to the Pope on this Subject There is one great Objection to  Civita Vecchia  that the Air of the Place is not wholsome but this they say proceeds from want of Inhabitants the Air of  Leghorne  having been worse than this before the Town was well peopled  The great Profits which have accrued to the Duke of  Florence  from his Free Port have set several of the States of  Italy  on the same Project The most likely to succeed in it would be the  Genoese  who lye more convenient than the  Venetians  and have a more inviting Form of Government than that of the Church or that of  Florence  But as the Port of  Genoa  is so very ill guarded against Storms that no Privileges can tempt the Merchants from  Leghorne  into it so dare not the  Genoese  make any other of their Ports Free least it should draw to it most of their Commerce and Inhabitants and by Consequence ruin their chief City  From  Leghorne  I went to  Pisa  where there is still the Shell of a great City  tho' not half furnish'd with Inhabitants The Great Church Baptistery and and Leaning Tower are very well worth seeing and are built after the same Fancy with the Cathedral of  Sienna  Half a Day's Journey more brought me into the Republick of  Lucca  THE REPUBLICK OF LVCCA  _IT is very pleasant to see how the small Territories of this little Republick are cultivated to the best Advantage so that one cannot find the least Spot of Ground that is not made to contribute its utmost to the Owner In all the Inhabitants there appears an Air of Chearfulness and Plenty not often to be met with in those of the Countries which lye about 'em There is but one Gate for Strangers to enter at that it may be known what Numbers of them are in the Town Over it is written in Letters of Gold  Libertas  This Republick is shut up in the Great Duke's Dominions who at present  is very much incensed against it and seems to threaten it with the Fate of  Florence    Pisa  and  Sienna  The Occasion as follows  The  Lucquese  plead Prescription for Hunting in one of the Duke's Forests that lyes upon their Frontiers which about Two Years since was strictly forbidden them the Prince intending to preserve the Game for his own Pleasure Two or Three Sportsmen of the Republick who had the Hardiness to offend against the Prohibition were seized and kept in a neighbouring Prison Their Countrymen to the number of Threescore attack'd the Place where they were kept in Custody and rescued them The Great Duke redemands his Prisoners and as a further Satisfaction would have the Governor of the Town where the Threescore Assailants had combined together deliver'd into his Hands but receiving only Excuses he resolved to do himself Justice Accordingly he order'd all the  Lucquese  to be seiz'd that were found on a MarketDay in one of his Frontier Towns These amounted to Fourscore among whom were Persons of some Consequence in the Republick They are now in Prison at  Florence  and  as it is said treated hardly enough for there are Fifteen of the Number dead within less than Two Years The King of  Spain  who is Protector of the Commonwealth received Information from the Great Duke of what had pass'd who approved of his Proceedings and order'd the  Lucquese  by his Governour or  Milan  to give a proper Satisfaction The Republick thinking themselves ill used by their Protector as they say at  Florence  have sent to Prince  Eugene  to desire the Emperor's Protection with an offer of WinterQuarters as it is said for Four Thousand  Germans  The Great Duke rises on them in his Demands and will not be satisfy'd with less than a Hundred Thousand Crowns and a Solemn Ambassy to beg Pardon for the past and promise Amendment for the future Thus stands the Affair at present that may end in the Ruin of the Commonwealth if the  French  succeed in  Italy  It is pleasant however to hear the Discourse of the Common People of  Lucca  who are firmly persuaded that One  Lucquese  can beat Five  Florentines  who are grown low spirited as they pretend by the Great Duke's Oppressions and have nothing worth fighting for They say they can bring into the Field  Twenty or Thirty Thousand fighting Men all ready to Sacrifice their Lives for their Liberty They have Quantity of Arms and Ammunition but few Horse It must be own'd these People are more happy at least in Imagination than the rest of their Neighbours because they think themselves so tho' such a Chimerical Happiness is not peculiar to Republicans for we find the Subjects of the most absolute Prince in  Europe  are as proud of their Monarch as the  Lucquese  of being subject to none Should the  French  Affairs prosper in  Italy  it is possible the Great Duke may bargain for the Republick of  Lucca  by the help of his great Treasures as his Predecessors did formerly with the Emperor for that of  Sienna  The Great Dukes have never yet attempted any thing on  Lucca  as not only fearing the Arms of their Protector but because they are well assured that should the  Lucquese  be reduced to the last Extremities they would rather throw themselves under the Government of the  Geneose  or some stronger Neighbour than submit to a State for which they have so great an Aversion And the  Florentines  are very sensible that it is much better having a weak State within their Dominions  than the Branch of one as strong as themselves But should so formidable a Power as that of the  French  King support them in their Attempts there is no Government in  Italy  that would dare to interpose This Republick for the Extent of its Dominions is esteemed the richest and best peopled State of  Italy  The whole Administration of the Government passes into different Hands at the End of every Two Months which is the greatest Security imaginable to their Liberty and wonderfully contributes to the quick Dispatch of all publick Affairs But in any Exigence of State like that they are now pressed with it certainly asks a much longer time to conduct any Design for the Good of the Commonwealth to its Maturity and Perfection  FLORENCE  _I Had the good Luck to be at  Florence  when there was an Opera acted which was the Eighth that I had seen in  Italy  I could not but smile to read the Solemn Protestation of the Poet in the first Page where he declares that he believes neither in the Fates Deities or Destinies and that if he has made use of the Words it is purely out of a Poetical Liberty and not from his real Sentiments for that in all these Particulars he believes as the Holy Mother Church believes and commands  PROTESTA  Le voci Fato Deità Destino e Simili che per entro questo Drama trovarai son messe per ischerzo poetico e non per Sentimento vero credendo Sempre in tutto quello che crede e comanda Santa Madre chiesa  There are some beautiful Palaces it  Florence  and as  Tuscan  Pillars and  Rustic  Work owe their Original to this Country the Architects always take care to give them a Place in the great Edifices that are raised in  Tuscany  The Duke's new Palace is a very noble Pile built after this manner which makes it look extremely Solid and Majestick It is not unlike that of  Luxemburg  at  Paris  which was built by  Mary  of  Medicis  and for that Reason perhaps the Workmen fell into the  Tuscan  Humour I found in the Court of this Palace what I could not meet with any where in  Rome  I mean an Antique Statue of  Hercules  lifting up  Antaeus  from the Earth which I have already had occasion to speak of It was found in  Rome  and brought hither under the Reign of  Leo  the Tenth There are abundance of Pictures in the several Apartments by the Hands of the greatest Masters  But 'tis the Famous Gallery of the Old Palace where are perhaps the noblest Collections of Curiosities to be met with in any Part of the whole World The Gallery it self is made in the Shape of an L according to Mr  Lassel  but if it must needs be like a Letter it resembles the  Greek  Π most It is adorned with admirable Pieces of Sculpture  as well Modern as Ancient Of the last Sort I shall mention those that are rarest either for the Person they represent or the Beauty of the Sculpture Among the Busts of the Emperors and Emperesses there are these that follow which are all very scarce and some of them almost singular in their kind  Agrippa    Caligula    Otho    Nerva    Aelius Verus    Pertinax    Geta    Didius    Julianus    Albinus  extremely well wrought and what is seldom seen in Alabaster  Gordianus Africanus  the elder  Eliogabalus    Galien  the elder and the younger  Pupienus  I have put  Agrippa  among the Emperors because he is generally ranged so in Sets of Medals as some that follow among the Emperesses have no other Right to the Company they are joined with  Domitia    Agrippina  Wife of  Germanicus    Antonia    Matidia    Plotina    Mallia Scantilla  falsely inscribed under her Bust  Julia Severi    Aquilia Severa    Julia Maesa  I have generally observed at  Rome  which is the great Magazine of these Antiquities that the same Heads which are rare in Medals are also rare in Marble and indeed one may commonly assign the same Reason for both which was the Shortness of the Emperor Reigns that did not give the Work  men time to make many of their Figures and as the Shortness of their Reigns was generally occasioned by the Advancement of a Rival it is no Wonder that no Body worked on the Figure of a Deceased Emperor when his Enemy was in the Throne This Observation however does not always hold An  Agrippa  or  Caligula  for Example is a common Coin but a very extraordinary Bust and a  Tiberius  a rare Coin but a common Bust which one would the more wonder at if we consider the Indignities that were offered to this Emperor's Statues after his Death The  Tiberius in Tiberim  is a known Instance  Among the Busts of such Emperors as are common enough there are several in the Gallery that deserve to be taken notice of for the Excellence of the Sculpture as those of  Augustus    Vespasian    Adrian    Marcus Aurelius    Lucius Verus    Septimius Severus    Caracalla    Geta  There is in the same Gallery a beautiful Bust of  Alexander  the Great casting up his Face to Heaven with a noble Air of Grief or Discontentedness in his Looks I have seen Two or Three antique Busts of  Alexander  in the same Air and Posture and am apt to think the Sculptor had in his Thoughts the  Conqueror's weeping for new Worlds or some other the like Circumstance of his History There is also in  Porphyry  the Head of a Faun and of the God  Pan  Among the entire Figures I took particular notice of a Vestal Virgin with the Holy Fire burning before her This Statue I think may decide that notable Controversie among the Antiquaries whether the Vestals after having received the Tonsure ever suffered their Hair to come again for it is here full grown and gathered under the Veil The Brazen Figure of the Consul with the Ring on his Finger reminded me of  Juvenal  's  majoris pondera Gemmae  There is another Statue in Brass supposed to be of  Apollo  with this Modern Inscription on the Pedestal which I must confess I do not know what to make of  Ut potui huc veni musis et fratre relicto  I saw in the same Gallery the Famous Figure of the Wild Boar the Gladiator the  Narcissus  the  Cupid  and  Psyche  the  Flora  with some Modern Statues that several others have described Among the Antique Figures there is a fine one of  Morpheus  in Touchstone I have always observed that this God is represented by the ancient Statuaries under the Figure of a Boy asleep  with a Bundle of Poppy in his Hand I at first took it for a  Cupid  'till I had taken notice that it had neither Bow nor Quiver I suppose Doctor  Lister  has been guilty of the same Mistake in the Reflections he makes on what he calls the sleeping  Cupid  with Poppy in his Hands  Qualia namque  Corpora nudorum tabulâ pinguntur Amorum  Talis erat sed nè faciat discrimina cultus  Aut huic adde leves aut illis deme pharetras  Ov Met L  Such are the  Cupids  that in Paint we view  But that the Likeness may be nicely true  A loaden Quiver to his Shoulders tie  Or bid the  Cupids  lay their Quivers by  'Tis probable they chose to represent the God of Sleep under the Figure of a Boy contrary to all our Modern Designers because it is that Age which has its Repose the least broken by Cares and Anxieties  Statius  in his celebrated Invocation of Sleep addresses himself to him under the same Figure  Crimine quo merui juvenis placidissime Divûm  Quove errore miser donis ut solus egerem  Somne tuis tacet omne pecus volucresque feraeque  c  Silv Li  Tell me thou best of Gods thou gentle Youth  Tell me my sad Offence that only I  While hush'd at Ease thy drowsie Subjects lye  In the dead Silence of the Night complain  Nor taste the Blessings of thy peaceful Reign  I never saw any Figure of Sleep that was not of Black Marble which has probably some Relation to the Night that is the proper Season for Rest I should not have made this Remark but that I remember to have read in one of the ancient Authors that the  Nile  is generally represented in Stone of this Colour because it flows from the Country of the  Ethiopians  which shows us that the Statuaries had sometimes an Eye to the Person they were to represent in the Choice they made of their Marble There are still at  Rome  some of  these Black Statues of the  Nile  which are cut in a kind of Touchstone  Usque coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis  Virg Geor de Nilo  At one End of the Gallery stand Two antique Marble Pillars curiously wrought with the Figures of the old  Roman  Arms and Instruments of War After a full Survey of the Gallery we were led into Four or Five Chambers of Curiosities that stand on the Side of it The First was a Cabinet of Antiquities made up chiefly of Idols Talismans Lamps and Hieroglyphics I saw nothing in it that I was not before acquainted with except the Four following Figures in Brass  I A little Image of  Juno Sispita  or  Sospita  which perhaps is not to be met with any where else but on Medals She is cloathed in a Goatsskin the Horns sticking out above her Head The Right Arm is broken that probably supported a Shield and the Left a little defac'd tho' one may see it held something in its Grasp formerly The Feet are bare I remember  Tully  's Description of this Goddess in the following Words  Hercle inquit quàm tibi illam nostram Sospitam quam tu nunquam nè in Somniis vides nisi cum pelle Caprinâ  cum hastâ cum scutulo cum calceolis repandis  IVNONISIS PITAE S C  A Medal of  Juno Sispita    Vid Fulv Ursin in Familiâ Thoriâ Porciliâ  This is a Reverse of  Anton Pius  II An antique Model of the Famous  Laocöon  and his Two Sons that stands in the  Belvidera  at  Rome  This is the more remarkable as it is entire in those Parts where the Statue is maim'd It was by the help of this Model that  Bandinelli  finished his admirable Copy of the  Laocöon  which stands at one End of this Gallery  III An  Apollo  or  Amphion  I took notice of this little Figure for the Singularity of the Instrument which I never before saw in ancient Sculpture It is not unlike a Violin and play'd on after the same manner I doubt howeever whether this Figure be not of a  later Date than the rest by the Meanness of the Workmanship  IV A  Corona Radialis  with only Eight Spikes to it Every one knows the usual Number was Twelve some say Allusion to the Signs of the  Zodiac  and others to the Labours of  Hercules  Ingenti mole Latinus  Quadrijugo vehitur curru cui tempora circùm  Aurati bis Sex Radii fulgentia cingunt  Solis avi Specimen  Virg Aen  Four Steeds the Chariot of  Latinus  bear  Twelve Golden Beams around his Temples play  To mark his Lineage from the God of Day Mr  Dryden  The two next Chambers are made up of several Artificial Curiosities in Ivory Amber Crystal Marble and precious Stones which all VoyageWriters are full of In the Chamber that is shown last stands the celebrated  Venus  of  Medicis  The Statue seems much less than the Life as being perfectly naked and in Company with others of a larger Make It is notwithstanding as big as the ordinary size of a Woman as I  concluded from the Measure of her Wrist for from the Bigness of any one Part it is easie to guess at all the rest in a Figure of such nice Proportions The Softness of the Flesh the Delicacy of the Shape Air and Posture and the Correctness of Design in this Statue are inexpressible I have several Reasons to believe that the Name of the Sculptor on the Pedestal is not so old as the Statue This Figure of  Venus  put me in Mind of a Speech she makes in one of the  Greek  Epigrams    Anchises    Paris  and  Adonis  too  Have seen me naked and expos'd to view  All these I frankly own without denying  But where has this  Praxiteles  been prying  There is another  Venus  in the same Circle that would make a good Figure any where else There are among the old  Roman  Statues several of  Venus  in different Postures and Habits as there are many particular Figures of her made after the  same Design I fancy it is not hard to find among them some that were made after the Three Statues of this Goddess which  Pliny  mentions In the same Chamber is the  Roman  Slave whetting his Knife and listning which from the Shoulders upward is incomparable The Two Wrestlers are in the same Room I observed here likewise a very curious Bust of  Annius Verus  the young Son of  Marcus Aurelius  who dy'd at Nine Years of Age I have seen several other Busts of him at  Rome  tho' his Medals are exceeding rare  The Great Duke has ordered a large Chamber to be fitted up for old Inscriptions Urns Monuments and the like Sets of Antiquities I was shown several of them which are not yet put up There are the Two Famous Inscriptions that give so great a light to the Histories of  Appius  who made the Highway and of  Fabius  the Dictator they contain a short Account of the Honours they pass'd through and the Actions they performed I saw too the Busts of  Tranquillina  Mother to  Gordianus Pius  and of  Quintus Herennius  Son to  Trajan Decius  which are extremely valuable for their Rarity and a beautiful old Figure  made after the celebrated Hermaphrodite in the  Villa Borghese  I saw nothing that has not been observed by several others in the  Argenteria  the Tabernacle of St  Laurence  's Chapel and the Chamber of Painters The Chapel of St  Laurence  will be perhaps the most costly Piece of Work on the Face of the Earth when compleated but it advances so very slowly that 'tis not impossible but the Family of  Medicis  may be Extinct before their Burial Place is finish'd  The Great Duke has lived many Years separate from the Dutchess who is at present in the Court of  France  and intends there to end her Days The Cardinal his Brother is old and infirm and could never be induced to resign his Purple for the uncertain Prospect of giving an Heir to the Dukedom of  Tuscany  The Great Prince has been marry'd several Years without any Children and notwithstanding all the Precautions in the World were taken for the Marriage of the Prince his younger Brother as the finding out a Lady for him who was in the Vigour and Flower of her Age and had given Marks of her Fruitfulness by a former Husband they have all hitherto proved unsuccessful  There is a Branch of the Family of  Medicis  in  Naples  The Head of it has been own'd as a Kinsman by the Grand Duke and 'tis thought will succeed to his Dominions in case the Princes his Sons die Childless though 'tis not impossible but in such a Conjuncture the Commonwealths that are thrown under the Great Dutchy may make some Efforts towards the Recovery of their ancient Liberty  I was in the Library of Manuscripts belonging to St  Laurence  of which there is a Printed Catalogue I look'd into the  Virgil  which disputes its Antiquity with that of the  Vatican  It wants the  Ille ego qui quondam  c and the Twenty Two Lines in the Second  Aeneid  beginning at  Jamque adeo super unus eram  I must confess I always thought this Passage left out with a great deal of Judgment by  Tucca  and  Varius  as it seems to contradict a Part in the Sixth  Aeneid  and represents the Heroe in a Passion that is at least not at all becoming the Greatness of his Character Besides I think the Apparition of  Venus  comes in very properly to draw him away from the Sight of  Priam  's Murder for without such a Machine to take him off I can't see how the Heroe could  with Honour leave  Neoptolemus  triumphant and  Priam  unrevenged But since  Virgil  's Friends thought fit to let drop this Incident of  Helen  I wonder they would not blot out or alter a Line in  Venus  's Speech that has a Relation to the Rencounter and comes in improperly without it  Non tibi Tyndaridae facies invisa Lacaenae  Culpatusve Paris  Aen  Florence  for Modern Statues I think excels even  Rome  but these I shall pass over in silence that I may not Transcribe out of others  The Way from  Florence  to  Bolonia  runs over several Ranges of Mountains and is the worst Road I believe of any over the  Appennines  for this was my Third Time of crossing them It gave me a lively Idea of  Silius Italicus  's Description of  Hannibal  's March  Quoque magis subiere jugo atque evadere nisi  Erexere gradum crescit labor ardua supra  Sese aperit fessis et nascitur altera moles  L  From Steep to Steep the Troops advanc'd with Pain  In hopes at last the topmost Cliff to gain  But still by new Ascents the Mountain grew  And a fresh Toil presented to their View  I shall conclude this Chapter with the Descriptions which the  Latin  Poets have given us of the  Appennines  We may observe in them all the remarkable Qualities of this prodigious length of Mountains that run from one Extremity of  Italy  to the other and give Rise to an incredible Variety of Rivers that water this delightful Country  Nubifer Appenninus  Ov Met L

 In their dark Womb a Thousand Rivers lye  That with continu'd Streams the double Sea supply  Bolonia Modena Parma Turin c  _AFTER a very tedious Journey over the  Appennines  we at last came to the River that runs at the Foot of them and was formerly call'd the little  Rhine  Following the Course of this River we arrived in a short time at  Bolonia  Parvique Bononia Rheni  Sil It  Bolonia  water'd by the petty  Rhine  We here quickly felt the Difference of the Northern from the Southern Side of the Mountains as well in the Coldness of the Air as in the Badness of the Wine This Town is Famous for the Richness of the Soil that lyes about it and the Magnificence of its Convents It is likewise esteemed the Third in  Italy  for Pictures as having  been the School of the  Lombard  Painters I saw in it Three Rarities of different kinds which pleased me more than any other Shows of the Place The first was an Authentick Silver Medal of the younger  Brutus  in the Hands of an Eminent Antiquary One may see the Character of the Person in the Features of the Face which is exquisitely well cut On the Reverse is the Cap of Liberty with a Dagger on each side of it subscribed  Id Mar  for the Ides of  March  the famous Date of  Caesar  's Murder The Second was a Picture of  Raphel  's in St  Giouanni  in  Monte  It is extremely well preserved and represents St  Cecilia  with an Instrument of Musick in her Hands On one side of her are the Figures of St  Paul  and St  John  and on the other of  Mary Magdalene  and St  Austin  There is something wonderfully Divine in the Airs of this Picture I cannot forbear mentioning for my Third Curiosity a new StairCase that Strangers are generally carryed to see where the Easiness of the Ascent within so small a Compass the Disposition of the Lights and the convenient Landing are admirably well contrived The Wars of  Italy  and the Season of the Year made me pass thro' the Dutchies  of  Modena    Parma  and  Savoy  with more haste than I would have done at another time The Soil of  Modena  and  Parma  is very rich and well cultivated The Palaces of the Princes are magnificent but neither of them is yet finished We procured a Licence of the Duke of  Parma  to enter the Theater and Gallery which deserve to be seen as well as any thing of that Nature in  Italy  The Theater is I think the most spacious of any I ever saw and at the same time so admirably well contrived that from the very depth of the Stage the lowest Sound may be heard distinctly to the farthest part of the Audience as in a Whispering Place and yet if you raise your Voice as high as you please there is nothing like an Echo to cause in it the least Confusion The Gallery is hung with a numerous Collection of Pictures all done by celebrated Hands On one Side of the Gallery is a large Room adorned with Inlaid Tables Cabinets Works in Amber and other Pieces of great Art and Value Out of this we were led into another great Room furnished with old Inscriptions Idols Busts Medals and the like Antiquities I could have spent a Day with great Satisfaction in  this Apartment but had only time to pass my Eye over the Medals which are in great Number and many of them very rare The scarcest of all is a  Pescennius Niger  on a Medalion well preserved It was coined at  Antioch  where this Emperor trifled away his Time 'till he lost his Life and Empire The Reverse is a  Dea Salus  There are Two of  Otho  the Reverse a  Serapis  and Two of  Messalina  and  Poppaea  in middle Brass the Reverses of the Emperor  Claudius  I saw Two Medalions of  Plotina  and  Matidia  the Reverse to each a  Pietas  with Two Medals of  Pertinax  the Reverse of one  Vota Decennalia  and of the other  Diis Custodibus  and another of  Gordianus Africanus  the Reverse I have forgot  The Principalities of  Modena  and  Parma  are much about the same Extent and have each of them Two large Towns besides a great Number of little Villages The Duke of  Parma  however is much richer than the Duke of  Modena  Their Subjects would live in great Plenty amidst so rich and well cultivated a Soil were not the Taxes and Impositions so very Exorbitant for the Courts are much too splendid and magnificent for the Territories that lye about  them and one cannot but be amazed to see such a Profusion of Wealth laid out in Coaches Trappings Tables Cabinets and the like precious Toys in which there are few Princes of  Europe  who equal them when at the same time they have not had the Generosity to make Bridges over the Rivers of their Countries for the Convenience of their Subjects as well as Strangers who are forced to pay an unreasonable Exaction at every Ferry upon the least Rising of the Waters A Man might well expect in these small Governments a much greater Regulation of Affairs for the Ease and Benefit of the People than in large overgrown States where the Rules of Justice Beneficence and Mercy may be easily put out of their Course in passing thro' the Hands of Deputies and a long Subordination of Officers And it would certainly be for the Good of Mankind to have all the mighty Empires and Monarchies of the World cantoned out into petty States and Principalities that like so many large Families might lye under the Eye and Observation of their proper Governors so that the Care of the Prince might extend it self to every individual Person under his Protection But since such a general Scheme can  never be brought about and if it were it would quickly be destroyed by the Ambition of some particular State aspiring above the rest it happens very ill at present to be born under one of these petty Soveraigns that will be still endeavouring at his Subjects Cost to equal the Pomp and Grandeur of greater Princes as well as to outvie those of his own Rank  For this Reason there are no People in the World who live with more Ease and Prosperity than the Subjects of little Commonwealths as on the contrary there are none who suffer more under the Grievances of a hard Government than the Subjects of little Principalities I left the Road of  Milan  on my Right Hand having before seen that City and after having passed through  Asti  the Frontier Town of  Savoy  I at last came within Sight of the  Po  which is a fine River even at  Turin  though within Six Miles of its Source This River has been made the Scene of Two or Three Poetical Stories  Ovid  has chosen it out to throw his  Phaeton  into it after all the smaller Rivers had been dryed up in the Conflagration  I have read some Botanical Criticks who tell us the Poets have not rightly  followed the Traditions of Antiquity in Metamorphosing the Sisters of  Phaeton  into Poplars who ought to have been turned into Larchtrees for that it is this kind of Tree which sheds a Gum and is commonly found on the Banks of the  Po  The Change of  Cycnus  into a Swan which closes up the Disasters of  Phaeton  's Family was wrought on the same Place where the Sisters were turned into Trees The Descriptions that  Virgil  and  Ovid  have made of it cannot be sufficiently admired  Claudian  has set off his Description of the  Eridanus  with all the Poetical Stories that have been made of it  Ille caput placidis sublime fluentis  Extulit et totis lucem spargentia ripis  Aurea roranti micuerunt cornua vultu  Non illi madidum vulgaris arundine crinem  Velat

Sexto Cons Honorii  His Head above the Floods he gently rear'd  And as he rose his golden Horns appear'd  That on the Forehead shone divinely bright  And o'er the Banks diffus'd a yellow Light  No interwoven Reeds a Garland made  To hide his Brows within the vulgar Shade  But Poplar Wreaths around his Temples spread  And Tears of Amber trickled down his Head  A spacious Veil from his broad Shoulders flew  That set th' unhappy  Phaeton  to view  The flaming Chariot and the Steeds it show'd  And the whole Fable in the Mantle glow'd  Beneath his Arm an Urn supported lyes  With Stars embellish'd and fictitious Skies  For  Titan  by the mighty Loss dismay'd  Among the Heav'ns th' Immortal Fact display'd  Lest the Remembrance of his Grief should fail  And in the Constellations wrote his Tale  A Swan in Memory of  Cycnus  shines  The Mourning Sisters weep in watry Signs  The burning Chariot and the Charioteer  In bright  Boötes  and his Wane appear  Whilst in a Track of Light the Waters run  That wash'd the Body of his blasted Son  The River  Po  gives a Name to the chief Street of  Turin  which fronts the Duke's Palace and when finish'd will be one of the noblest in  Italy  for its Length There is one Convenience in this City that I never observed in any  other and which makes some amends for the Badness of the Pavement By the help of a River that runs on the upper Side of the Town they can convey a little Stream of Water through all the most considerable Streets which serves to cleanse the Gutters and carries away all the Filth that is swept into it The Manager opens his Sluce every Night and distributes the Water into what Quarters of the Town he pleases Besides the ordinary Convenience that arises from it it is of great use when a Fire chances to break out for at a few Minutes warning they have a little River running by the very Walls of the House that is Burning The Court of  Turin  is reckoned the most splendid and Polite of any in  Italy  but by reason of its being in Mourning I could not see it in its Magnificence The common People of this State are more exasperated against the  French  than even the rest of the  Italians  For the great Mischiefs they have suffered from them are still fresh upon their Memories and notwithstanding this Interval of Peace one may easily trace out the several Marches which the  French  Armies have made through their Country by the Ruin and Desolation they have left behind  them I passed through  Piemont  and  Savoy  at a time when the Duke was forced by the Necessity of his Affairs to be in Alliance with the  French  I came directly from  Turin  to  Geneva  and had a very easie Journey over Mount  Cennis  though about the Beginning of  December  the Snows having not yet fallen On the Top of this high Mountain is a large Plain and in the midst of the Plain a beautiful Lake which would be very extraordinary were there not several Mountains in the Neighbourhood rising over it The Inhabitants thereabout pretend that it is unfathomable and I question not but the Waters of it fill up a deep Valley before they come to a Level with the Surface of the Plain It is well stocked with Trouts though they say it is covered with Ice Three Quarters of the Year  There is nothing in the natural Face of  Italy  that is more delightful to a Traveller than the several Lakes which are dispersed up and down among the many Breaks and Hollows of the  Alps  and  Appennines  For as these vast Heaps of Mountains are thrown together with so much Irregularity and Confusion they form a great Variety of hollow Bottoms that often lye in the Figure of  so many artificial Basins where if any Fountains chance to rise they naturally spread themselves into Lakes before they can find any Issue for their Waters The ancient  Romans  took a great deal of Pains to hew out a Passage for these Lakes to discharge themselves into some neighbouring River for the bettering of the Air or the recovering of the Soil that lay underneath them The Draining of the  Fucinus  by the Emperor  Claudius  with the prodigious Multitude of Spectators who attended it and the Famous  Naumachia  and splendid Entertainment which were made upon it before the Sluces were opened is a known Piece of History In all our Journey through the  Alps  as well when we climbed as when we descended them we had still a River running along with the Road that probably at first occasioned the Discovery of this Passage I shall end this Chapter with a Description of the  Alps  as I did the last with those of the  Appennines  The Poet perhaps would not have taken notice that there is no Spring nor Summer on these Mountains but because in this Respect the  Alps  are quite different from the  Appennines  which have as delightful Green Spots among them as any in  Italy  Cuncta gelu canâque aeternùm grandine tecta  Atque aevi glaciem cohibent riget ardua montis  Aetherii facies surgentique obvia Phoebo  Duratas nescit flammis mollire pruinas  Quantùm Tartareus regni pallentis hiatus  Ad manes imos atque atrae flagna paludis  A superâ tellure patet tam longa per auras  Erigitur tellus et coelum intercipit Umbrâ  Nullum ver usquam nullique Aestatis honores  Sola jugis habitat  sedesqué tuetur  Perpetuas deformis Hyems illa undique nubes  Huc atras agit et mixtos cum grandine nimbos  Nam cuncti flatus ventique furentia regna  Alpinâ posuere domo caligat in altis  Obtutus saxis abeuntque in nubila montes  Sil It L  Stiff with Eternal Ice and hid in Snow  That fell a Thousand Centuries ago  The Mountain stands nor can the rising Sun  Unfix her Frosts and teach 'em how to run  Deep as the dark Infernal Waters lye  From the bright Regions of the chearful Sky  So far the proud ascending Rocks invade  Heav'ns upper Realms and cast a dreadful Shade  No Spring nor Summer on the Mountain seen  Smiles with gay Fruits or with delightful Green  But hoary Winter unadorn'd and bare  Dwells in the dire Retreat and freezes there  There she assembles all her blackest Storms  And the rude Hail in rattling Tempests forms  Thither the loud tumultuous Winds resort  And on the Mountain keep their boist'rous Court  That in thick Show'rs her rocky Summet shrowds  And darkens all the broken View with Clouds  GENEVA AND THE LAKE  _NEAR St  Julian  in  Savoy  the  Alps  begin to enlarge themselves on all sides and open into a vast Circuit of Ground which in Respect of the other Parts of the  Alps  may pass for a plain Champian Country This Extent of Lands with the  Leman  Lake would make one of the prettiest and most defensible Dominions in  Europe  was it all thrown into a single State and had  Geneva  for its Metropolis But there are Three powerful Neighbours who divide among them the greatest part of this fruitful Country The Duke of  Savoy  has the  Chablais  and all the Fields that lye beyond the  Arve  as far as to the  Ecluse  The King of  France  is Master of the whole Country of  Gex  and the Canton of  Bern  comes in for that of  Vaud Geneva  and its little Territories lye in the Heart of these Three States The greatest part of the Town stands upon a Hill and has its Views bounded on all Sides by several Ranges of Mountains which are however at so great a Distance that they leave open a wonderful Variety of beautiful Prospects The Situation of these Mountains has some particular Effects on the Country which they enclose As first they cover it from all Winds except the South and North 'Tis to the last of these Winds that the Inhabitants of  Geneva  ascribe the Healthfulness of their Air for as the  Alps  surround them on all sides they form a vast kind of Bason where there would be a constant Stagnation of Vapours the Country being so well water'd did not the North Wind put them in Motion and scatter them from time to time Another Effect the  Alps  have on  Geneva  is that the Sun here rises later and sets sooner than it does to other Places of the same Latitude I have often observed that the Tops of the neighbouring Mountains have been covered with Light above half an Hour after the Sun is down in respect of those who live at  Geneva  These Mountains  likewise very much increase their Summer Heats and make up a Horizon that has something in it very singular and agreeable On one Side you have the long Tract of Hills that goes under the Name of Mount  Jura  covered with Vineyards and Pasturage and on the other huge Precipices of naked Rocks rising up in a Thousand odd Figures and cleft in some Places so as to discover high Mountains of Snow that lye several Leagues behind them Towards the South the Hills rise more insensibly and leave the Eye a vast uninterrupted Prospect for many Miles But the most beautiful View of all is the Lake and the Borders of it that lye North of the Town  This Lake resembles a Sea in the Colour of its Waters the Storms that are raised on it and the Ravage it makes on its Banks It receives too a different Name from the Coasts it washes and in Summer has something like an Ebb and Flow which arises from the melting of the Snows that fall into it more copiously at Noon than at other times of the Day It has Five different States bordering on it the Kingdom of  France  the Dutchy of  Savoy  the Canton of  Bern  the Bishoprick of  Sion  and the  Republick of  Geneva  I have seen Papers fix'd up in the Canton of  Bern  with this magnificent Preface  Whereas we have been informed of several Abuses committed in our Ports and Harbours on the Lake  c  I made a little Voyage round the Lake and touch'd on the several Towns that lye on its Coasts which took up near Five Days tho' the Wind was pretty fair for us all the while  The Right Side of the Lake from  Geneva  belongs to the Duke of  Savoy  and is extreamly well cultivated The greatest Entertainment we found in coasting it were the several Prospects of Woods Vineyards Meadows and CornFields which lye on the Borders of it and run up all the Sides of the  Alps  where the Barrenness of the Rocks or the Steepness of the Ascent will suffer them The Wine however on this side of the Lake is by no means so good as that on the other as it has not so open a Soil and is less expos'd to the Sun We here pass'd by  Yvoire  where the Duke keeps his Gallies and lodg'd at  Tonon  which is the greatest Town on the Lake belonging to the  Savoyard  It has Four Convents and they say about six or seven Thousand Inhabitants The Lake is here about Twelve Miles in Breadth At a little  Distance from  Tonon  stands  Ripaille  where is a Convent of  Carthusians  They have a large Forest cut out into Walks that are extremely thick and gloomy and very suitable to the Genius of the Inhabitants There are  Vista  's in it of a great Length that terminate upon the Lake At one Side of the Walks you have a near Prospect of the  Alps  which are broken into so many Steps and Precipices that they fill the Mind with an agreeable kind of Horror and form one of the most irregular misshapen Scenes in the World The House that is now in the Hands of the  Carthusians  belong'd formerly to the Hermites of St  Maurice  and is famous in History for the Retreat of an AntiPope who call'd himself  Felix  the Fifth He had been Duke of  Savoy  and after a very glorious Reign took on him the Habit of a Hermite and retired into this Solitary Spot of his Dominions His Enemies will have it that he lived here in great Ease and Luxury from whence the  Italians  to this Day make use of the Proverb  Andare a Ripaglia  and the  French    Faire Ripaille  to express a delightful kind of Life They say too that he had great Managements with several Eccelesiasticks before he turned Hermite and that he did it in the View of being advanced to the Pontificate  However it was he had not been here half a Year before he was chosen Pope by the Council of  Basil  who took upon them to Depose  Eugenio  the Fourth This promised fair at first but by the Death of the Emperor who favoured  Amadeo  and the Resolution of  Eugenio  the greatest part of the Church threw it self again under the Government of their deposed Head Our AntiPope however was still supported by the Council of  Basil  and owned by  Savoy    Switzerland  and a few other little States This Schism lasted in the Church Nine Years after which  Felix  voluntarily resigned his Title into the Hands of Pope  Nicholas  the Fifth but on the following Conditions That  Amadeo  should be the First Cardinal in the Conclave That the Pope should always receive him standing and offer him his Mouth to kiss That he should be perpetual CardinalLegate in the States of  Savoy  and  Switzerland  and in the Archbishopricks of  Geneva    Sion    Bress  c And lastly That all the Cardinals of his Creation should be recognized by the Pope After he had made a Peace so acceptable to the Church and so honourable to himself he spent the Remainder of his Life with great Devotion at  Ripaille    and dy'd with an extraordinary Reputation of Sanctity  At  Tonon  they showed us a Fountain of Water that is in great Esteem for its Wholesomness They say it weights Two Ounces in a Pound less than the same Measure of the Lake Water notwithstanding this last is very good to Drink and as clear as can be imagined A little above  Tonon  is a Castle and small Garrison The next Day we saw other small Towns on the Coast of  Savoy  where there is nothing but Misery and Poverty The nearer you come to the End of the Lake the Mountains on each side grow thicker and higher 'till at last they almost meet One often sees on the Tops of the Mountains several sharp Rocks that stand above the rest for as these Mountains have been doubtless much higher than they are at present the Rains have washed away abundance of the Soil that has left the Veins of Stone shooting out of them as in a decay'd Body the Flesh is still shrinking from the Bones The Natural Histories of  Switzerland  talk very much of the Fall of these Rocks and the great Damage they have sometimes done when their Foundations have been mouldered with Age or rent by an Earthquake We saw in several Parts  of the  Alps  that bordered upon us vast Pits of Snow as several Mountains that lye at a greater Distance are wholly covered with it I fancy'd the Confusion of Mountains and Hollows I here observed furnished me with a more probable Reason than any I have met with for those Periodical Fountains in  Switzerland  which flow only at such particular Hours of the Day For as the Tops of these Mountains cast their Shadows upon one another they hinder the Sun's shining on several Parts at such certain times so that there are several Heaps of Snow which have the Sun lying upon them Two or Three Hours together and are in the Shade all the Day afterwards If therefore it happens that any particular Fountain takes its Rise from any of these Reservoirs of Snow it will naturally begin to flow on such Hours of the Day as the Snow begins to melt but as soon as the Sun leaves it again to freeze and harden the Fountain dries up and receives no more Supplies 'till about the same time the next Day when the Heat of the Sun again sets the Snows a running that fall into the same little Conduits Traces and Canals and by Consequence break out and discover themselves always in the same Place At the  very Extremity of the Lake the  Rhone  enters and when I saw it brought along with it a prodigious Quantity of Water the Rivers and Lakes of this Country being much higher in Summer than in Winter by reason of the melting of the Snows One would wonder how so many Learned Men could fall into so great an Absurdity as to believe this River could preserve it self unmix'd with the Lake 'till its going out again at  Geneva  which is a Course of many Miles It was extreamly muddy at its Entrance when I saw it though as clear as RockWater at its going out Besides that it brought in much more Water than it carryed off The River indeed preserves it self for about a Quarter of a Mile in the Lake but is afterwards so wholly mixed and lost with the Waters of the Lake that one discovers nothing like a Stream 'till within about a Quarter of a Mile of  Geneva  From the End of the Lake to the Source of the  Rhone  is a Valley of about Four Days Journey in Length which gives the Name of  Vallesins  to its Inhabitants and is the Dominion of the Bishop of  Sion  We lodged the Second Night at  Ville Neuve  a little Town in the Canton of  Bern  where we found good Accommodations  and a much greater Appearance of Plenty than on the other side of the Lake The next Day having passed by the Castle of  Chillon  we came to  Versoy  another Town in the Canton of  Bern  where  Ludlow  retired after having left  Geneva  and  Lausanne  The Magistrates of the Town warned him out of the First by the Sollicitation of the Dutchess of  Orleans  as the Death of his Friend  Lisle  made him quit the other He probably chose this Retreat as a Place of the greatest Safety it being an easie matter to know what Strangers are in the Town by Reason of its Situation The House he lived in has this Inscription over the Door  Omne solum forti patria quia patris  The first Part is a Piece of a Verse in  Ovid  as the last is a Cant of his own He is buryed in the best of the Churches with the following Epitaph  Siste gradum et respice  Hic jacet Edmond Ludlow Anglus Natione Provinciae Wiltoniensis filius Henrici Equestris Ordinis Senatorisque Parlamenti cujus quoque fuit ipse membrum  Patrum stemmate clarus et nobilis virtute proprià nobilior Religione protestans et insigni pietate coruscus Aetatis Anno Tribunus Militum paulo post exercitûs praetor primarius Tunc Hibernorum domitor in pugná intrepidus et vitae

obitum usque constanter secuta est Anno Dom  Ludlow  was a constant Frequenter of Sermons and Prayers but would never Communicate with them either of  Geneva  or  Vevy  Just by his Monument is a Tombstone with the following Inscription  Depositorium  Andreae Broughton Armigeri Anglicani Maydstonensis in Comitatu Cantii ubi bis praetor Urbanus Dignatusque etiam fuit sententiam Regis Regum profari Quam ob causam expulsus patriâ suâ peregrinatione ejus finitâ solo senectutis morbo affectus requiescens a laboribus suis in Domino obdormivit  die Feb Anno D    aetatis suae    The Inhabitants of the Place could give no Account of this  Broughton  but I suppose by his Epitaph it is the same Person that was Clerk to the pretended High Court of Justice which passed Sentence on the Royal Martyr  The next Day we spent at  Lausanne  the greatest Town on the Lake after  Geneva  We saw the Wall of the Cathedral Church that was opened by an Earthquake and shut again some Years after by a Second The Crack can but be just discerned at present though there are several in the Town still living who have formerly passed through it The Duke of  Schomberg  who was killed in  Savoy  lyes in this Church but without any Monument or Inscription over him  Lausanne  was once a Republick but is now under the Canton of  Bern  and governed  like the rest of their Dominions by a Baily who is sent them every Three Years from the Senate of  Bern  There is one Street of this Town that has the Privilege of acquitting or condemning any Person of their own Body in Matters of Life and Death Every Inhabitant of it has his Vote which makes a House here sell better than in any other Part of the Town They tell you that not many Years ago it happened that a Cobler had the Casting Vote for the Life of a Criminal which he very graciously gave on the merciful Side From  Lausanne  to  Geneva  we coasted along the Country of the  Vaud  which is the fruitfullest and best cultivated Part of any among the  Alps  It belonged formerly to the Duke of  Savoy  but was won from him by the Canton of  Bern  and made over to it by the Treaty of St  Julian  which is still very much regretted by the  Savoyard  We called in at  Morge  where there is an artificial Port and a show of more Trade than in any other Town on the Lake From  Morge  we came to  Nyon  The  Colonia Equestris  that  Julius Caesar  settled in this Country is generally supposed to have been planted in this Place They have often dug up old  Roman  Inscriptions  and Statues and as I walked in the Town I observed in the Walls of several Houses the Fragments of vast  Corinthian  Pillars with several other Pieces of Architecture which must have formerly belonged to some very Noble Pile of Building There is no Author that mentions this Colony yet it is certain by several old  Roman  Inscriptions that there was such an one  Lucan  indeed speaks of a Part of  Caesar  's Army that came to him from the  Leman  Lake in the beginning of the Civil War  Deseruere cavo tentoria fixa Lemanno  At about Five Miles distance from  Nyon  they show still the Ruins of  Caesar  's Wall that reached eighteen Miles in Length from Mount  Jura  to the Borders of the Lake as he has described it in the First Book of his Commentaries The next Town upon the Lake is  Versoy  which we could not have an opportunity of seeing as belonging to the King of  France  It has the Reputation of being extremely poor and beggarly We sailed from hence directly for  Geneva  which makes a very noble Show from the Lake There are near  Geneva  several Quarries of Freestone  that run under the Lake When the Water is at lowest they make within the Borders of it a little Square enclosed with Four Walls In this Square they sink a Pit and dig for Freestone the Walls hindering the Waters from coming in upon them when the Lake rises and runs on all Sides of them The great Convenience of Carriage makes these Stones much cheaper than any that can be found upon firm Land One sees several deep Pits that have been made at several times as one sails over them As the Lake approaches  Geneva  it grows still narrower and narrower 'till at last it changes its Name into the  Rhone  that turns all the Mills of the Town and is extremely rapid notwithstanding its Waters are very deep As I have seen a great Part of the Course of this River I cannot but think it has been guided by the particular Hand of Providence It rises in the very Heart of the  Alps  and has a long Valley that seems hewn out on purpose to give its Waters a Passage amidst so many Rocks and Mountains which are on all Sides of it This brings it almost in a direct Line to  Geneva  It would there overflow all the Country were there not one particular Cleft that divides a vast  Circuit of Mountains and conveys it off to  Lyons  From  Lyons  there is another great Rent which runs across the whole Country in almost another streight Line and notwithstanding the vast height of the Mountains that rise about it gives it the shortest Course it can take to fall into the Sea Had such a River as this been left to it self to have found its way out from among the  Alps  whatever Windings it had made it must have formed several little Seas and have laid many Countries under Water before it had come to the End of its Course I shall not make any Remarks upon  Geneva  that is a Republick so well known to the  English  It lyes at present under some Difficulties by reason of the Emperor's Displeasure who has forbidden the Importation of their Manufactures into any Part of the Empire which will certainly raise a Sedition among the People unless the Magistrates find some way to remedy it and they say it is already done by the Interposition of the States of  Holland  The Occasion of the Emperor's Prohibition was their furnishing great Sums to the King of  France  for the Payment of his Army in  Italy  They obliged themselves to remit after the rate of Twelve Hundred Thousand  Pounds Sterling  per Annum  divided into so many Monthly Payments As the Interest was very great several of the Merchants of  Lyons  who would not trust their King in their own Names are said to have contributed a great deal under the Names of  Geneva  Merchants The Republick fancies it self hardly treated by the Emperor since it is not any Action of the State but a Compact among private Persons that hath furnished out these several Remittances They pretend however to have put a stop to them and by that means are in hopes again to open their Commerce into the Empire  Fribourg Bern Soleurre Zurich St Gaul Lindaw c  _FROM  Geneva  I travelled to  Lausanne  and thence to  Fribourg  which is but a mean Town for the Capital of so large a Canton Its Situation is so irregular that they are forced to climb up to several Parts of it by StairCases of a prodigious Ascent This Inconvenience however gives them a very great Commodity in case a Fire breaks out in any Part of the Town for by reason of several Reservoirs on the Tops of these Mountains by the opening of a Sluce they convey a River into what Part of the Town they please They have Four Churches Four Convents of Women and as many for Men The little Chappel called the  Salutation  is very neat and built with a pretty Fancy The College of Jesuits is they say the finest in  Switzerland  There is a great  deal of Room in it and several beautiful Views from the different Parts of it They have a Collection of Pictures representing most of the Fathers of their Order who have been Eminent for their Piety or Learning Among the rest many  English  Men whom we name Rebels and they Martyrs  Henry Garnet  's Inscription says That when the Hereticks could not prevail with him either by Force or Promises to change his Religion they Hanged and Quartered him At the  Capucins  I saw the Escargatoire which I took the more notice of because I do not remember to have met with any thing of the same in other Countries It is a square Place boarded in and filled with a vast quantity of large Snails that are esteemed excellent Food when they are well dressed The Floor is strowed about half a Foot deep with several kinds of Plants among which the Snails nestle all the Winter Season When  Lent  arrives they open their Magazines and take out of them the best meagre Food in the World for there is no Dish of Fish that they reckon comparable to a Ragoût of Snails  About Two Leagues from  Fribourg  we went to see a Hermitage that is  reckon'd the greatest Curiosity of these Parts It lyes in the prettiest Solitude imaginable among Woods and Rocks which at first Sight dispose a Man to be serious There has lived in it a Hermite these Five and Twenty Years who with his own Hands has worked in the Rock a pretty Chappel a Sacristie a Chamber Kitchin Cellar and other Conveniences His Chimney is carry'd up through the whole Rock so that you see the Sky through it notwithstanding the Rooms lye very deep He has cut the Side of the Rock into a Flat for a Garden and by laying on it the waste Earth that he has found in several of the neighbouring Parts has made such a Spot of Ground of it as furnishes out a kind of Luxury for a Hermite As he saw Drops of Water distilling from several Parts of the Rock by following the Veins of them he has made himself Two or Three Fountains in the Bowels of the Mountain that serve his Table and water his little Garden  We had very bad Ways from hence to  Bern  a great Part of them through Woods of Firtrees The great Quantity of Timber they have in this Country makes them mend their Highways with Wood instead of Stone I could  not but take notice of the Make of several of their Barns I here saw After having laid a Frame of Wood for the Foundation they place at the Four Corners of it Four huge Blocks cut in such a Shape as neither Mice nor any other sort of Vermin can creep up the Sides of them at the same time that they raise the Corn above the Moisture that might come into it from the Ground The whole weight of the Barn is supported by these Four Blocks  What pleased me most at  Bern  was their publick Walks by the Great Church They are raised extremely high and that their Weight might not break down the Walls and Pilasters which surround them they are built upon Arches and Vaults Tho' they are I believe as high as most Steeples in  England  from the Streets and Gardens that lye at the Foot of them yet about Forty Years ago a Person in his Drink fell down from the very Top to the Bottom without doing himself any other Hurt than the Breaking of an Arm He dy'd about Four Years ago There is the noblest SummerProspect in the World from this Walk for you have a full View of a huge Range of Mountains that lye in the Country of the  Grisons    and are bury'd in Snow They are about Twenty Five Leagues distance from the Town though by Reason of their Height and their Colour they seem much nearer The Cathedral Church stands on one side of these Walks and is perhaps the most Magnificent of any Protestant Church in  Europe  out of  England  It is a very bold Work and a Masterpiece in  Gothic  Architecture  I saw the Arsenal of  Bern  where they say there are Arms for Twenty Thousand Men There is indeed no great Pleasure in visiting these Magazines of War after one has seen Two or Three of them yet it is very well worth a Traveller's while to look into all that lye in his Way for besides the Idea it gives him of the Forces of a State it serves to fix in his Mind the most considerable Parts of its History Thus in that of  Geneva  one meets with the Ladders Petard and other Utensils which were made use of in their Famous Escalade besides the Weapons they took of the  Savoyards    Florentines  and  French  in the several Battels mentioned in their History In this of  Bern  you have the Figure and Armour of the Count who founded the Town of the Famous  Tell  who is represented as shooting  at the Apple on his Son's Head The Story is too well known to be repeated in this Place I here likewise saw the Figure and Armour of him that headed the Peasants in the War upon  Bern  with the several Weapons which were found in the Hands of his Followers They show too abundance of Arms that they took from the  Burgundians  in the Three great Battels which establish'd them in their Library and destroy'd the Great Duke of  Burgundy  himself with the bravest of his Subjects I saw nothing remarkable in the Chambers where the Council meet nor in the Fortifications of the Town These last were made on Occasion of the Peasants Insurrection to defend the Place for the future against the like sudden Assaults In their Liberty I observed a couple of antique Figures in Metal of a Priest pouring Wine between the Horns of a Bull The Priest is veil'd after the manner of the old  Roman  Sacrificers and is represented in the same Action that  Virgil  describes in the Third  Aeneid  Ipsa tenens dextrâ pateram pulcherrima Dido  Candentis vaccae media inter cornua fundit  This Antiquity was found at  Lausanne  The Town of  Bern  is plentifully furnish'd with Water there being a great Multitude of handsome Fountains planted at set Distances from one End of the Streets to the other There is indeed no Country in the World better supply'd with Water than the several Parts of  Switzerland  that I travell'd through One meets every where in the Roads with Fountains continually running into huge Troughs that stand underneath them which is wonderfully commodious in a Country that so much abounds with Horses and Cattle It has so many Springs breaking out of the Sides of the Hills and such vast Quantities of Wood to make Pipes of that it is no Wonder they are so well stock'd with Fountains  On the Road between  Bern  and  Soleurre  there is a Monument erected by the Republick of  Bern  which tells us the Story of an  English  Man who is not to be met with in any of our own Writers The Inscription is in  Latin  Verse on one side of the Stone and in  German  on the other I had not Time to Copy it but the Substance of it is this  One  Cussinus  an  English  Man to whom the Duke of  Austria  had given  his Sister in Marriage came to take her from among the  Swiss  by Force of Arms but after having ravaged the Country for some time he was here overthrown by the Canton of  Bern  Soleurre  is our next considerable Town that seemed to me to have a greater Air of Politeness than any I saw in  Switzerland  The  French  Ambassador has his Residence in this Place His Master contributed a great Sum of Mony to the Jesuits Church which is not yet quite finished It is the finest Modern Building in  Switzerland  The old Cathedral Church stood not far from it At the Ascent that leads to it are a couple of antique Pillars which belonged to an old Heathen Temple Dedicated to  Hermes  They seem  Tuscan  by their Proportion The whole Fortification of  Soleurre  is faced with Marble But its best Fortifications are the high Mountains that lye within its Neighbourhood and separate it from the  Franche Comptè  The next Day's Journey carry'd us through other Parts of the Canton of  Bern  to the little Town of  Meldingen  I was surprised to find in all my Road through  Switzerland  the Wine that grows in the Country of  Vaud  on the  Borders of the Lake of  Geneva  which is very cheap notwithstanding the great Distance between the Vineyards and the Towns that sell the Wine But the Navigable Rivers of  Switzerland  are as commodious to them in this Respect as the Sea is to the  English  As soon as the Vintage is over they Ship off their Wine upon the Lake which furnishes all the Towns that lye upon its Borders What they design for other Parts of the Country they unload at  Very  and after about half a Day's LandCarriage convey it into the River  Aar  which brings it down the Stream to  Bern    Soleurre  and in a Word distributes it through all the richest Parts of  Switzerland  as it is easie to guess from the first sight of the Map which shows us the natural Communication Providence has formed between the many Rivers and Lakes of a Country that is at so great a distance from the Sea The Canton of  Bern  is reckoned as powerful as all the rest together They can send a Hundred Thousand Men into the Field tho' the Soldiers of the Catholick Cantons who are much poorer and therefore forced to enter oftner into Foreign Armies are more esteemed than the Protestants  We lay one Night at  Meldingen  which is a little  Roman  Catholick Town with one Church and no Convent It is a Republick of it self under the Protection of the Eight ancient Cantons There are in it a Hundred Bourgeois and about a Thousand Souls Their Government is modelled after the same manner with that of the Cantons as much as so small a Community can imitate those of so large an Extent For this Reason though they have very little Business to do they have all the Variety of Councils and Officers that are to be met with in the greater States They have a TownHouse to meet in adorn'd with the Arms of the Eight Cantons their Protectors They have Three Councils the Great Council of Fourteen the Little Council of Ten and the Privy Council of Three The chief of the State are the Two Avoyers When I was there the Reigning Avoyer or Doge of the Commonwealth was Son to the Inn where I was lodged His Father having enjoy'd the same Honours before him His Revenue amounts to about Thirty Pound a Year The several Councils meet every  Thursday  upon Affairs of State such as the Reparation of a Trough the mending of a Pavement or any the like  Matters of Importance The River that runs through their Dominions puts them to the Charge of a very large Bridge that is all made of Wood and coped over Head like the rest in  Switzerland  Those that travel over it pay a certain Due towards the Maintenance of this Bridge And as the  French  Ambassador has often occasion to pass this way his Master gives the Town a Pension of Twenty Pound Sterling which makes them extremely industrious to raise all the Men they can for his Service and keeps this powerful Republick firm to the  French  Interest You may be sure the Preserving of the Bridge with the Regulation of the Dues arising from it is the grand Affair that cuts out Employment for the several Councils of State They have a small Village belonging to them whither they punctually send a Bailiff for the Distribution of Justice in Imitation still of the Great Cantons There are Three other Towns that have the same Privileges and Protectors  We Dined the next Day at  Zurich  that is prettily situated on the Outlet of the Lake and is reckoned the handsomest Town in  Switzerland  The chief Places shown to Strangers are the Arsenal the Library and the TownHouse  This last is but lately finished and is a very fine Pile of Building The Frontispiece has Pillars of a beautiful Black Marble streaked with White which is found in the neighbouring Mountains The Chambers for the several Councils with the other Apartments are very neat The whole Building is indeed so well designed that it would make a good Figure even in  Italy  It is pity they have spoil'd the Beauty of the Walls with abundance of childish  Latin  Sentences that consist often in a Jingle of Words I have indeed observed in several Inscriptions of this Country that your Men of Learning here are extremely delighted in playing little Tricks with Words and Figures for your  Swiss  Wits are not yet got out of Anagram and Acrostick The Library is a very large Room pretty well filled Over it is another Room furnished with several artificial and natural Curiosities I saw in it a huge Map of the whole Country of  Zurich  drawn with a Pensil where they see every particular Fountain and Hillock in their Dominions I ran over their Cabinet of Medals but don't remember to have met with any in it that are extraordinary rare The Arsenal is better than that of  Bern  and they say has Arms  for Thirty Thousand Men At about a Day's Journey from  Zurich  we entered on the Territories of the Abbot of St  Gaul  They are Four Hours Riding in Breadth and Twelve in Length The Abbot can raise in it an Army of Twelve Thousand Men well armed and exercised He is Soveraign of the whole Country and under the Protection of the Cantons of  Zurich    Lucerne    Glaris  and  Switz  He is always chosen out of the Abby of  Benedictines  at St  Gaul  Every Father and Brother of the Convent has a Voice in the Election which must afterwards be confirmed by the Pope The last Abbot was Cardinal  Sfondrati  who was advanced to the Purple about Two Years before his Death The Abbot takes the Advice and Consent of his Chapter before he enters on any Matter of Importance as the levying of a Tax or declaring of a War His chief LayOfficer is the Grand  Maître d' Hôtel  or HighSteward of the Houshold who is named by the Abbot and has the Management of all Affairs under him There are several other Judges and Distributers of Justice appointed for the several Parts of his Dominions from whom there always lyes an Appeal to the Prince His Residence is generaliy at the  Benedictine  Convent at  St  Gaul  notwithstanding the Town of St  Gaul  is a little Protestant Republick wholly independent of the Abbot and under the Protection of the Cantons  One would wonder to see so many rich Bourgeois in the Town of St  Gaul  and so very few poor People in a Place that has scarce any Lands belonging to it and little or no Income but what arises from its Trade But the great Support and Riches of this little State is its Linnen Manufacture which employs almost all Ages and Conditions of its Inhabitants The whole Country about them furnishes them with vast Quantities of Flax out of which they are said to make yearly Forty Thousand Pieces of Linnen Cloath reckoning Two Hundred Ells to the Piece Some of their Manufacture is as finely wrought as any that can be met with in  Holland  for they have Excellent Artizans and great Commodities for Whitening All the Fields about the Town were so covered with their Manufacture that coming in the Dusk of the Evening we mistook them for a Lake They send off their Works upon Mules into  Italy    Spain    Germany  and all the adjacent Countries They reckon in the Town of St  Gaul  and in the Houses that lye scattered about it near Ten Thousand  Souls of which there are Sixteen Hundred Burgeois They chuse their Councils and BurgoMasters out of the Body of the Burgeois as in the other Governments of  Switzerland  which are every where of the same Nature the difference lying only in the Numbers of such as are employed in State Affairs which are proportioned to the Grandeur of the States that employ them The Abby and the Town bear a great Aversion to one another but in the General Diet of the Cantons their Representatives sit together and act by Concert The Abbot deputes his  Grand Maître d' Hôtel  and the Town one of its BurgoMasters  About Four Years ago the Town and Abby wou'd have come to an open Rupture had it not been timely prevented by the Interposition of their common Protectors The Occasion was this A  Benedictine  Monk in one of their annual Processions carried his Cross erected through the Town with a Train of Three or Four Thousand Peasants following him They had no sooner entered the Convent but the whole Town was in a Tumult occasion'd by the Insolence of the Priest who contrary to all Precedents had presumed to carry his Cross in that  manner The Burgeois immediately put themselves in Arms and drew down Four Pieces of their Cannon to the Gates of the Convent The Procession to escape the Fury of the Citizens durst not return by the Way it came but after the Devotions of the Monks were finish'd pass'd out at a Backdoor of the Convent that immediately led into the Abbot's Territories The Abbot on his Part raises an Army blocks up the Town on the Side that faces his Dominions and forbids his Subjects to furnish it with any of their Commodities While things were just ripe for a War the Cantons their Protectors interpos'd as Umpires in the Quarrel condemning the Town that had appear'd too forward in the Dispute to a Fine of Two Thousand Crowns and Enacting at the same time That as soon as any Procession enter'd their Walls the Priest should let the Cross hang about his Neck without touching it with either Hand 'till he came within the Precincts of the Abby The Citizens could bring into the Field near Two Thousand Men well exercis'd and arm'd to the best Advantage with which they fancy they could make Head against Twelve or Fifteen Thousand Peasants for so many  the Abbot could easily raise in his Territories But the Protestant Subjects of the Abby who they say make up a good Third of its People would probably in case of a War abandon the Cause of their Prince for that of their Religion The Town of St  Gaul  has an Arsenal Library TownHouses and Churches proportionable to the Bigness of the State It is well enough fortify'd to resist any sudden Attack and to give the Cantons time to come to their Assistance The Abby is by no means so Magnificent as one would expect from its Endowments The Church is one huge Nef with a double Aisle to it At each End is a large Quire The one of them is supported by vast Pillars of Stone cas'd over with a Composition that looks the most like Marble of any thing one can imagine On the Cieling and Walls of the Church are Lists of Saints Martyrs Popes Cardinals ArchBishops Kings and Queens that have been of the  Benedictine  Order There are several Pictures of such as have been distinguish'd by their Birth Sanctity or Miracles with Inscriptions that let you into the Name and History of the Persons represented I have often wish'd that some Traveller would take the Pains  to gather together all the Modern Inscriptions which are to be met with in  Roman  Catholick Countries as  Gruter  and others have copy'd out the ancient Heathen Monuments Had we Two or Three Volumes of this Nature without any of the Collector's own Reflections I am sure there is nothing in the World could give a truer Idea of the  Roman  Catholick Religion nor expose more the Pride Vanity and SelfInterest of Convents the Abuse of Indulgencies the Folly and Impertinence of Votaries and in short the Superstition Credulity and Childishness of the  Roman  Catholick Religion One might fill several Sheets at St  Gaul  as there are few considerable Convents or Churches that would not afford large Contributions  As the King of  France  distributes his Pensions through all the Parts of  Switzerland  the Town and Abby of St  Gaul  come in too for their Share To the First he gives Five Hundred Crowns  per Annum  and to the other a Thousand This Pension has not been paid these Three Years which they attribute to their not acknowledging the Duke of  Anjou  for King of  Spain  The Town and Abby of St  Gaul  carry a Bear for  their Arms The  Roman  Catholicks have this Bear's Memory in very great Veneration and represent him as the first Convert their Saint made in the Country One of the most Learned of the  Benedictine  Monks gave me the following History of him which he deliver'd to me with Tears of Affection in his Eyes St  Gaul  it seems whom they call the great Apostle of  Germany  found all this Country little better than a vast Desart As he was walking in it on a very cold Day he chanc'd to meet a Bear in his Way The Saint instead of being startled at the Rencounter order'd the Bear to bring him a Bundle of Wood and make him a Fire The Bear serv'd him to the best of his Ability and at his Departure was commanded by the Saint to retire into the very Depth of the Woods and there to pass the rest of his Life without ever hurting Man or Beast From this time says the Monk the Bear liv'd irreproachably and observ'd to his dying Day the Orders that the Saint had given him  I have often consider'd with a great deal of Pleasure the profound Peace and Tranquillity that reigns in  Switzerland  and its Alliances It is very wonderful to see such a Knot of Governments  which are so divided among themselves in Matters of Religion maintain so uninterrupted an Union and Correspondance that no one of them is for Invading the Rights of another but remains content within the Bounds of its First Establishment This I think must be chiefly ascribed to the Nature of the People and the Constitution of their Governments Were the  Swiss  animated by Zeal or Ambition some or other of their States would immediately break in upon the rest or were the States so many Principalities they might often have an ambitious Soveraign at the Head of them that would embroil his Neighbours and sacrifice the Repose of his Subjects to his own Glory But as the Inhabitants of these Countries are naturally of a heavy Phlegmatick Temper if any of their leading Members have more Fire and Spirit than comes to their Share it is quickly temper'd by the Coldness and Moderation of the rest who sit at the Helm with them To this we may add that the  Alps  is the worst Spot of Ground in the World to make Conquests in a great Part of its Governments being so naturally intrench'd among Woods and Mountains However it be we find no such Disorders among them as  one would expect in such a Multitude of States for as soon as any Publick Rupture happens it is immediately clos'd up by the Moderation and good Offices of the rest that interpose  As all the considerable Governments among the  Alps  are Commonwealths so indeed it is a Constitution the most adapted of any other to the Poverty and Barrenness of these Countries We may see only in a neighbouring Government the ill Consequences of having a Despotic Prince in a State that is most of it composed of Rocks and Mountains for notwithstanding there is a vast Extent of Lands and many of them better than those of the  Swiss  and  Grisons  the common People among the latter are much more at their Ease and in a greater Affluence of all the Conveniences of Life A Prince's Court eats too much into the Income of a poor State and generally introduces a kind of Luxury and Magnificence that sets every particular Person upon making a higher Figure in his Station than is generally consistent with his Revenue  It is the great Endeavour of the several Cantons of  Switzerland  to banish from among them every thing that looks like Pomp or Superfluity To this End  the Ministers are always Preaching and the Governors putting out Edicts against Dancing Gaming Entertainments and fine Cloaths This is become more necessary in some of the Governments since there are so many Refugees settled among them for tho' the Protestants in  France  affect ordinarily a greater Plainness and Simplicity of Manners than those of the same Quality who are of the  Roman  Catholick Communion they have however too much of their CountryGallantry for the Genius and Constitution of  Switzerland  Should Dressing Feasting and Balls once get among the Cantons their Military Roughness would be quickly lost their Tempers would grow too soft for their Climate and their Expences outrun their Incomes besides that the Materials for their Luxury must be brought from other Nations which would immediately ruin a Country that has few Commodities of its own to export and is not overstock'd with Mony Luxury indeed wounds a Republick in its very Vitals as its natural Consequences are Rapine Avarice and Injustice for the more Mony a Man spends the more must he endeavour to augment his Stock which at last sets the Liberty  and Votes of a Commonwealth to Sale if they find any Foreign Power that is able to pay the Price of them We see no where the pernicious Effects of Luxury on a Republick more than in that of the ancient  Romans  who immediately found it self poor as soon as this Vice got Footing among them though they were possess'd of all the Riches in the World We find in the Beginnings and Increases of their Commonwealth strange Instances of the Contempt of Mony because indeed they were utter Strangers to the Pleasures that might be procured by it or in other Words because they were wholly ignorant of the Arts of Luxury But as soon as they once enter'd into a Taste of Pleasure Politeness and Magnificence they fell into a Thousand Violences Conspiracies and Divisions that threw them into all the Disorders imaginable and terminated in the utter Subversion of the Commonwealth It is no wonder therefore the poor Commonwealths of  Switzerland  are ever labouring at the Suppression and Prohibition of every thing that may introduce Vanity and Luxury Beside the several Fines that are set upon Plays Games Balls and Feastings they have many Customs among them  which very much contribute to the keeping up of their ancient Simplicity The Bourgeois who are at the Head of the Governments are obliged to appear at all their publick Assemblies in a Black Cloak and a Band The Womens Dress is very plain those of the best Quality wearing nothing on their Heads generally but Furs which are to be met with in their own Country The Persons of different Qualities in both Sexes are indeed allowed their different Ornaments but these are generally such as are by no means costly being rather designed as Marks of Distinction than to make a Figure The chief Officers of  Bern  for Example are known by the Crowns of their Hats which are much deeper than those of an inferior Character The Peasants are generally cloathed in a coarse kind of Canvas that is the Manufacture of the Country Their Holyday Cloaths go from Father to Son and are seldom worn out 'till the Second or Third Generation So that it is common enough to see a Countryman in the Doublet and Breeches of his Greatgrandfather  Geneva  is much politer than  Switzerland  or any of its Allies and is therefore looked upon as the Court of the  Alps  whither the Protestant Cantons often send their Children to improve themselves in Language and Education The  Genevois  have been very much refin'd or as others will have it corrupted by the Conversation of the  French  Protestants who make up almost a Third of their People It is certain they have very much forgotten the Advice that  Calvin  gave them in a great Council a little before his Death when he recommended to them above all Things an Exemplary Modesty and Humility and as great a Simplicity in their Manners as in their Religion Whether or no they have done well to set up for making another kind of Figure Time will witness There are several that fancy the great Sums they have remitted into  Italy  though by this means they make their Court to the King of  France  at present may some time or other give him an Inclination to become the Master of so wealthy a City  As this Collection of little States abounds more in Pasturage than in Corn they are all provided with their publick Granaries and have the Humanity to furnish one another in publick Exigencies when the Scarcity is not Universal As the Administration of Affairs  relating to these publick Granaries is not very different in any of the particular Governments I shall content my self to set down the Rules observed in it by the little Commonwealth of  Geneva  in which I had more Time to inform my self of the Particulars than in any other There are Three of the Little Council deputed for this Office They are obliged to keep together a Provision sufficient to feed the People at least Two Years in case of War or Famine They must take care to fill their Magazines in Times of the greatest Plenty that so they may afford cheaper and increase the publick Revenue at a small Expence of its Members None of the Three Managers must upon any Pretence furnish the Granaries from his own Fields that so they may have no Temptation to pay too great a Price or put any bad Corn upon the Publick They must buy up no Corn growing within Twelve Miles of  Geneva  that so the filling of their Magazines may not prejudice their Market and raise the Price of their Provisions at Home That such a Collection of Corn may not spoil in keeping all the Inns and PublickHouses are obliged to furnish themselves out of it by which means is raised the most considerable  Branch of the publick Revenues the Corn being sold out at a much dearer Rate than 'tis bought up So that the greatest Income of the Commonwealth which pays the Pensions of most of its Officers and Ministers is raised on Strangers and Travellers or such of their own Body as have Mony enough to spend at Taverns and PublickHouses  It is the Custom in  Geneva  and  Switzerland  to divide their Estates equally among all their Children by which means every one lives at his Ease without growing dangerous to the Republick for as soon as an overgrown Estate falls into the Hands of one that has many Children it is broken into so many Portions as render the Sharers of it Rich enough without raising them too much above the Level of the rest This is absolutely necessary in these little Republicks where the Rich Merchants live very much within their Estates and by heaping up vast Sums from Year to Year might become formidable to the rest of their FellowCitizens and break the Equality which is so necessary in these kinds of Governments were there not means found out to distribute their Wealth among several Members of their Republick At  Geneva  for Instance are Merchants  reckon'd worth Twenty Hundred Thousand Crowns though perhaps there is not one of them who spends to the value of Five Hundred Pounds a Year  Though the Protestants and Papists know very well that it is their common Interest to keep a steddy Neutrality in all the Wars between the States of  Europe  they cannot forbear siding with a Party in their Discourse The Catholicks are zealous for the  French  King as the Protestants do not a little glory in the Riches Power and good Success of the  English  and  Dutch  whom they look upon as the Bulwarks of the Reformation The Ministers in particular have often preached against such of their FellowSubjects as enter into the Troops of the  French  King but so long as the  Swiss  see their Interest in it their Poverty will always hold them fast to his Service They have indeed the Exercise of their Religion and their Ministers with them which is the more remarkable because the very same Prince refused even those of the Church of  England  who follow'd their Master to St  Germains  the publick Exercise of their Religion  Before I leave  Switzerland  I cannot but observe that the Notion of Witchcraft  reigns very much in this Country I have often been tired with Accounts of this Nature from very sensible Men that are most of them furnish'd with Matters of Fact which have happened as they pretend within the compass of their own Knowledge It is certain there have been many Executions on this Account as in the Canton of  Bern  there were some put to Death during my Stay at  Geneva  The People are so universally infatuated with the Notion that if a Cow falls sick it is Ten to One but an Old Woman is clapt up in Prison for it and if the poor Creature chance to think her self a Witch the whole Country is for hanging her up without Mercy One finds indeed the same Humour prevail in most of the rocky Barren Parts of  Europe  Whether it be that Poverty and Ignorance which are generally the Products of these Countries may really engage a Wretch in such dark Practices or whether or no the same Principles may not render the People too credulous and perhaps too easy to get rid of some of their unprofitable Members  A great Affair that employs the  Swiss  Politicks at present is the Prince of  Conti  's Succession to the Dutchess of  Nemours  in the Government of  NeufChatel  The Inhabitants of  NeufChatel  can by no means think of submitting themselves to a Prince who is a  Roman  Catholick and a Subject of  France  They were very attentive to his Conduct in the Principality of  Orange  which they did not question but he would Rule with all the Mildness and Moderation imaginable as it would be the best Means in the World to recommend him to  NeufChatel  But notwithstanding it was so much his Interest to manage his Protestant Subjects in that Country and the strong Assurances he had given them in protecting them in all their Privileges and particularly in the free Exercise of their Religion he made over his Principality in a very little time for a Sum of Mony to the King of  France  It is indeed generally believed the Prince of  Conti  would rather still have kept his Title to  Orange  but the same Respect which induced him to quit this Government might at another time tempt him to give up that of  NeufChatel  on the like Conditions The King of  Prussia  lays in his claim for  NeufChatel  as he did for the Principality of  Orange  and 'tis probable would be more acceptable to the Inhabitants than the other but they are generally  dispos'd to declare themselves a Free Commonwealth after the Death of the Dutchess of  Nemours  if the  Swiss  will support them The Protestant Cantons seem much inclin'd to assist them which they may very well do in case the Dutchess dies whilst the King of  France  has his Hands so full of Business on all sides of him It certainly very much concerns them not to suffer the  French  King to Establish his Authority on this side Mount  Jura  and on the very Borders of their Country but it is not easie to foresee what a round Sum of Mony or the Fear of a Rupture with  France  may do among a People who have tamely suffer'd the  Franche Comptè  to be seiz'd on and a Fort to be built within Cannonshot of one of their Cantons  There is a new Sect sprung up in  Switzerland  which spreads very much in the Protestant Cantons The Professors of it call themselves  Pietists  and as Enthusiasm carries Men generally to the like Extravagancies they differ but little from several Sectaries in other Countries They pretend in general to great Refinements as to what regards the Practice of Christianity and to observe the following Rules To retire  much from the Conversation of the World To sink themselves into an entire Repose and Tranquillity of Mind In this State of Silence to attend the secret Illapse and Flowings in of the Holy Spirit that may fill their Minds with Peace and Consolation Joys or Raptures To favour all his secret Intimations and give themselves up entirely to his Conduct and Direction so as neither to speak move or act but as they find his Impulse on their Souls To retrench themselves within the Conveniencies and Necessities of Life To make a Covenant with all their Senses so far as to shun the Smell of a Rose or Violet and to turn away their Eyes from a beautiful Prospect To avoid as much as is possible what the World calls Innocent Pleasures lest they should have their Affections tainted by any Sensuality and diverted from the Love of him who is to be the only Comfort Repose Hope and Delight of their whole Beings This Sect prevails very much among the Protestants of  Germany  as well as those of  Switzerland  and has occasion'd several Edicts against it in the Dutchy of  Saxony  The Professors of it are accus'd of all the ill Practices which may seem to be the Consequence of their  Principles as that they ascribe the worst of Actions which their own vicious Tempers throw them upon to the Dictates of the Holy Spirit that both Sexes under Pretence of Devout Conversation visit one another at all Hours and in all Places without any regard to common Decency often making their Religion a Cover for their Immoralities and that the very best of them are possess'd with Spiritual Pride and a Contempt for all such as are not of their own Sect The  Roman  Catholicks who reproach the Protestants for their breaking into such a Multitude of Religions have certainly taken the most effectual way in the World for the keeping their Flocks together I don't mean the Punishments they inflict on Mens Persons which are commonly look'd upon as the chief Methods by which they deter them from breaking through the Pale of the Church though certainly these lay a very great Restraint on those of the  Roman  Catholick Persuasion But I take one great Cause why there are so few Sects in the Church of  Rome  to be the Multitude of Convents with which they every where abound that serve as Receptacles for all those fiery Zealots who would set the Church in a Flame  were not they got together in these Houses of Devotion All Men of dark Tempers according to their Degree of Melancholy or Enthusiasm may find Convents fitted to their Humours and meet with Companions as gloomy as themselves So that what the Protestants would call a Fanatick is in the  Roman  Church a Religious of such or such an Order as I have been told of an  English  Merchant at  Lisbon  who after some great Disappointments in the World was resolv'd to turn Quaker or Capuchin for in the Change of Religion Men of ordinary Understandings don't so much consider the Principles as the Practice of those to whom they go over  From St  Gaul  I took Horse to the Lake of  Constance  which lyes at Two Leagues Distance from it and is form'd by the Entry of the  Rhine  This is the only Lake in  Europe  that disputes for Greatness with that of  Geneva  it appears more beautiful to the Eye but wants the fruitful Fields and Vineyards that border upon the other It receives its Name from  Constance  the chief Town on its Banks When the Cantons of  Bern  and  Zurich  proposed at a general Diet the Incorporating  Geneva  in the  Number of the Cantons the  Roman  Catholick Party fearing the Protestant Interest might receive by it too great a Strengthning proposed at the same time the Incantoning of  Constance  as a Counterpoise to which the Protestants not consenting the whole Project fell to the Ground We cross'd the Lake to  Lindaw  and in several Parts of it observed abundance of little Bubbles of Air that came working upward from the very Bottom of the Lake The Watermen told us that they are observed always to rise in the same Places from whence they conclude them to be so many Springs that break out of the Bottom of the Lake  Lindaw  is an Imperial Town on a little Island that lyes at about Three Hundred Paces from the firm Land to which it is join'd by a huge Bridge of Wood The Inhabitants were all in Arms when we pass'd through it being under great Apprehensions of the Duke of  Bavaria  after his having fallen upon  Ulm  and  Memminghen  They flatter themselves that by cutting their Bridge they could hold out against his Army But in all Probability a Shower of Bombs would quickly reduce the Burgeois to Surrender They were formerly Bombarded by  Gustavus Adolphus  We were advis'd by our Merchants by no means to venture our selves in the Duke of  Bavaria  's Country so that we had the Mortification to lose the Sight of  Munich    Ausburg  and  Ratisbon  and were forced to take our Way to  Vienna  through the  Tirol  where we had very little to Entertain us besides the natural Face of the Country  TIROL INSPRUCK HALL c  _AFTER having coasted the  Alps  for some time we at last entered them by a Passage which leads into the long Valley of the  Tirol  and following the Course of the River  Inn  we came to  Inspruck  that receives its Name from this River and is the Capital City of the  Tirol  Inspruck  is a handsome Town though not a great one and was formerly the Residence of the ArchDukes who were Counts of  Tirol  The Palace where they used to keep their Court is rather Convenient than Magnificent The great Hall is indeed a very noble Room the Walls of it are painted in  Fresco  and  represent the Labours of  Hercules  Many of them look very finely though a great part of the Work has been crack'd by Earthquakes which are very frequent in this Country There is a little Wooden Palace that borders on the other whither the Court used to retire at the first shake of an Earthquake I saw here the largest Menage that I have met with any where else At one End of it is a great Partition designed for an Opera They showed us also a very pretty Theatre The last Comedy that was acted on it was designed by the Jesuits for the Entertainment of the Queen of the  Romans  who pass'd this way from  Hanover  to  Vienna  The Compliment which the Fathers made her Majesty on this occasion was very particular and did not a little expose them to the Raillery of the Court For the Arms of  Hanover  being a Horse the Fathers thought it a very pretty Allusion to represent the Queen by  Bucephalus  that would let no Body get upon him but  Alexander  the Great The Wooden Horse that acted this nobtale Part is still to be seen behind the Scenes In one of the Rooms of the Palace which is hung with the Pictures of several Illustrious Persons they showed us the Portrait  of  Mary  Queen of the  Scots  who was beheaded in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  The Gardens about the House are very large but ill kept There is in the middle of them a beautiful Statue in Brass of an ArchDuke  Leopold  on Horseback There are near it Twelve other Figures of WaterNymphs and RiverGods well Cast and as big as the Life They were designed for the Ornaments of a WaterWork as one might easily make a great Variety of Jetteaus at a small Expence in a Garden that has the River  Inn  running by its Walls The late Duke of  Lorrain  had this Palace and the Government of the  Tirol  assigned him by the Emperor and his Lady the Queen Dowager of  Poland  lived here several Years after the Death of the Duke her Husband There are covered Galleries that lead from the Palace to Five different Churches I passed through a very long one which reaches to the Church of the  Capucin  Convent where the Duke of  Lorrain  used often to assist at their Midnight Devotions They showed us in this Convent the Apartments of  Maximilian  who was ArchDuke and Count of  Tirol  about Fourscore Years ago This Prince at the same time that he kept the  Government in his Hands lived in this Convent with all the Rigor and Austerity of a  Capucin  His AntiChamber and Room of Audience are little square Chambers Wainscoated His private Lodgings are Three or Four small Rooms faced with a kind of Fretwork that makes them look like little Hollow Caverns in a Rock They preserve this Apartment of the Convent uninhabited and show in it the Altar Bed and Stove as likewise a Picture and a Stamp of this Devout Prince The Church of the  Franciscan  Convent is famous for the Monument of the Emperor  Maximilian  the First which stands in the midst of it It was erected to him by his GrandSon  Ferdinand  the First who probably looked upon this Emperor as the Founder of the  Austrian  Greatness For as by his own Marriage he annexed the LowCountries to the House of  Austria  so by matching his Son to  Joan  of  Arragon  he settled on his Posterity the Kingdom of  Spain  and by the Marriage of his GrandSon  Ferdinand  got into his Family the Kingdoms of  Bohemia  and  Hungary  This Monument is only Honorary for the Ashes of the Emperor lye elsewhere On the Top of it is a Brazen Figure of  Maximilian  on his  Knees and on the Sides of it a beautiful  Bas Relief  representing the Actions of this Prince His whole History is digested into Twenty Four square Pannels of Sculpture in  Bas Relief  The Subject of Two of them is his Confederacy with  Henry  the Eighth and the Wars they made together upon  France  On each Side of this Monument is a Row of very noble Brazen Statues much bigger than the Life most of them representing such as were some way or other related to  Maximilian  Among the rest is one that the Fathers of the Convent tell us represents King  Arthur  the old  British  King But what Relation had that  Arthur  to  Maximilian  I don't question therefore but it was designed for Prince  Arthur  Elder Brother of  Henry  the Eighth who had espoused  Catharine  Sister of  Maximilian  whose Divorce afterwards gave occasion to such signal Revolutions in  England  This Church was built by  Ferdinand  the First One sees in it a kind of Offer at Modern Architecture but at the same time that the Architect has shown his Dislike of the  Gothick  manner one may see very well that in that Age they were not at least in this Country arrived at the Knowledge of the true Way  The Portal for Example consists of a composite Order unknown to the Ancients the Ornaments indeed are taken from them but so put together that you see the Volutes of the  Ionic  the Foliage of the  Corinthian  and the Uovali of the  Doric  mix'd without any Regularity on the same Capital So the Vault of the Church tho' broad enough is encumber'd with too many little Tricks in Sculpture It is indeed supported with single Columns instead of those vast Clusters of little Pillars that one meets with in  Gothic  Cathedrals but at the same time these Columns are of no regular Order and at least Twice too long for their Diameter There are other Churches in the Town and Two or Three Palaces which are of a more Modern Make and built with a good Fancy I was shown the little  Notredame  that is handsomly design'd and topp'd with a Cupola It was made as an Offering of Gratitude to the Blessed Virgin for having defended the Country of the  Tirol  against the Victorious Arms of  Gustavus Adolphus  who could not enter this Part of the Empire after having overrun most of the rest This Temple was therefore built by the Contributions of the whole Country At  about half a League's distance from  Inspruck  stands the Castle of  Amras  furnish'd with a prodigious Quantity of Medals and many other sorts of Rarities both in Nature and Art for which I must refer the Reader to Monsieur  Patin  's Account in his Letter to the Duke of  Wirtemburg  having my self had neither Time or Opportunity to enter into a particular Examination of them  From  Inspruck  we came to  Hall  that lyes at a League distance on the same River This Place is particularly famous for its SaltWorks There are in the Neighbourhood vast Mountains of a transparent kind of Rock not unlike Allum extreamly solid and as piquant to the Tongue as Salt it self Four or Five Hundred Men are always at Work in these Mountains where as soon as they have hewn down any Quantities of the Rock they let in their Springs and Reservoirs among their Works The Water eats away and dissolves the Particles of Salt which are mix'd in the Stone and is convey'd by long Troughs and Canals from the Mines to the Town of  Hall  where 'tis received in vast Cisterns and boil'd off from time to time  They make after the rate of Eight Hundred Loaves a Week each Loaf Four Hundred Pound Weight This would raise a great Revenue to the Emperor were there here such a Tax on Salt as there is in  France  At present he clears but Two Hundred Thousand Crowns a Year after having defray'd all the Charges of working it There are in  Switzerland  and other Parts of the  Alps  several of these Quarries of Salt that turn to very little Account by Reason of the great Quantities of Wood they consume  The SaltWorks at  Hall  have a great Convenience for Fuel which swims down to them on the River  Inn  This River during its Course through the  Tirol  is generally shut up between a double Range of Mountains that are most of them cover'd with Woods of FirTrees Abundance of Peasants are employ'd in the hewing down of the largest of these Trees that after they are Bark'd and cut into Shape are tumbled down from the Mountains into the Stream of the River which carries them off to the SaltWorks At  Inspruck  they take up vast Quantities for the Convents and publick Officers who have a certain Portion of it alloted them by the  Emperor the rest of it passes on to  Hall  There are generally several Hundred Loads afloat for they begin to cut above Twenty Five Leagues up the River above  Hall  and there are other Rivers that flow into the  Inn  which bring in their Contributions These SaltWorks and a Mint that is establish'd at the same Place have render'd this Town notwithstanding the Neighbourhood of the Capital City almost as populous as  Inspruck  it self The Design of this Mint is to work off part of the Metals which are found in the neighbouring Mountains where as we were told there are Seven Thousand Men in constant Employ At  Hall  we took a Boat to carry us to  Vienna  The First Night we lay at  Rottenburg  where is a strong Castle above the Town Count  Serini  is still close Prisoner in this Castle who as they told us in the Town had lost his Senses by his long Imprisonment and Afflictions The next Day we Din'd at  Kuffstain  where there is a Fortress on a high Rock above the Town almost inaccessible on all Sides This being a Frontier Place on the Dutchy of  Bavaria  where we enter'd after about an Hour's Rowing from  Kuffstain  It was the pleasantest Voyage in the World  to follow the Windings of this River  Inn  through such a Variety of pleasing Scenes as the Course of it naturally led us We had sometimes on each Side us a vast Extent of naked Rocks and Mountains broken into a Thousand irregular Steeps and Precipices in other Places we saw a long Forest of FirTrees so thick set together that it was impossible to discover any of the Soil they grew upon and rising up so regularly one above another as to give us the View of a whole Wood at once The time of the Year that had given the Leaves of the Trees so many different Colours compleated the Beauty of the Prospect But as the Materials of a fine Landskip are not always the most profitable to the Owner of them we met with but very little Corn or Pasturage for the Proportion of Earth that we pass'd through the Lands of the  Tirol  not being able to feed the Inhabitants This long Valley of the  Tirol  lyes enclosed on all Sides by the  Alps  tho' its Dominions shoot out into several Branches that lye among the Breaks and Hollows of the Mountains It is govern'd by Three Councils residing at  Inspruck  one sits upon Life and Death the other is for Taxes and Impositions  and a third for the common Distributions of Justice As these Courts regulate themselves by the Orders they receive from the Imperial Court so in many Cases there are Appeals from them to  Vienna  The Inhabitants of the  Tirol  have many particular Privileges above those of the other Hereditary Countries of the Emperor For as they are naturally well fortify'd among their Mountains and at the same time border upon many different Governments as the  Grisons    Venetians    Swiss    Bavarians  c a severe Treatment might tempt them to set up for a Republick or at least throw themselves under the milder Government of some of their Neighbours Besides that their Country is poor and that the Emperor draws considerable Incomes out of its Mines of Salt and Metal They are these Mines that fill the Country with greater Numbers of People than it would be able to bear without the Importation of Corn from Foreign Parts The Emperor has Forts and Cittadels at the Entrance of all the Passes that lead into the  Tirol  which are so advantagiously placed upon Rocks and Mountains that they command all the Vallies and Avenues that lye about them Besides that the Country it self  is cut into so many Hills and Inequalities as would render it defensible by a very little Army against a numerous Enemy It was therefore generally thought the Duke of  Bavaria  would not attempt the cutting off any Succours that were sent to Prince  Eugene  or the forcing his Way through the  Tirol  into  Italy  The River  Inn  that had hitherto been shut up among Mountains passes generally through a wide open Country during all its Course through  Bavaria  which is a Voyage of Two Days after the rate of Twenty Leagues a Day  INDEX  A  ADDA  and the  Addige  both describ'd by  Claudian    Page    Albano  for what famous
